In one proposal in 1814, as the British Navy threatened Washington, D.C. during the War of 1812, Evans ventured to build a steam-powered frigate, but the scheme didn't get far.|$|E
5|$|Love in Several Masques is a play by Henry Fielding {{that was}} first {{performed}} on 16 February 1728 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. The moderately received play comically depicts three lovers trying {{to pursue their}} individual beloveds. The beloveds require their lovers to meet their various demands, which serves as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>for</b> Fielding to introduce his personal feelings on morality and virtue. In addition, Fielding introduces criticism of women and society in general.|$|E

5|$|Smetana's {{visit to}} Liszt at Weimar {{in the summer}} of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a {{material}} reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>for</b> expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (RichardIII, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts.|$|E

Various problems with the issues, including mishandling of distributions and complaints that public coins should not be used for private profit, resulted in firm Treasury Department opposition to such issues, and none were struck after 1954.|$|E

For instance, if friends were telling a boy that a girl liked him but the boy didn’t like her back, the boy wouldn’t resort to telling his friends literally he didn’t like her. Instead, he could use the gandingan to express his reasons and his friends would be able to pick up the message by translating his song.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} mandate {{coupled with}} subsidies for private insurance as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>for</b> universal healthcare {{was considered the}} best way to win the support of the Senate because it had been included in prior bipartisan reform proposals. The concept goes back to at least 1989, when the conservative The Heritage Foundation proposed an individual mandate as an alternative to single-payer health care. It was championed for a time by conservative economists and Republican senators as a market-based approach to healthcare reform on the basis of individual responsibility and avoidance of free rider problems. Specifically, because the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires any hospital participating in Medicare (nearly all do) to provide emergency care to anyone who needs it, the government often indirectly bore the cost of those without the ability to pay.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} {{previous}} The Legend of Zelda games, solving puzzles and clearing dungeons remains a fundamental {{part of the}} gameplay. Progression through A Link Between Worlds is more open-ended than previous titles, {{with the possibility of}} tackling many of the game's dungeons in any order. Certain dungeon obstacles will require the use of the rented or purchased items. Towards the end of each dungeon, Link will encounter a boss that must be defeated. A unique mechanic that the game introduces is Link's ability to merge onto walls and move horizontally along them. Link is presented as a mural when he is merged on a wall, and upon merging, the game's perspective shifts to a side view to follow Link around corners. While merged to a wall, Link's energy gauge will deplete. The mechanic can be used for traversing the environment, reaching seemingly inaccessible areas, and avoiding hazards. It {{plays a key role in}} solving many of the game's puzzles and dungeons. Wall merging is also used as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>for</b> travelling between Hyrule and Lorule, via fissures that connect the two kingdoms.|$|E

5|$|Astrology is {{the study}} of the {{movements}} and relative positions of celestial objects as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>for</b> divining information about human affairs and terrestrial events. Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BCE, and has its roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications. Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and some – such as the Indians, Chinese, and Maya – developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. Western astrology, one of the oldest astrological systems still in use, can trace its roots to 19th–17th century BCE Mesopotamia, from which it spread to Ancient Greece, Rome, the Arab world and eventually Central and Western Europe. Contemporary Western astrology is often associated with systems of horoscopes that purport to explain aspects of a person's personality and predict significant events in their lives based on the positions of celestial objects; the majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.|$|E
5|$|Between 850 and 1100, the Empire {{developed}} a mixed {{relationship with the}} new state of the Kievan Rus', which had emerged to the north across the Black Sea. This relationship would have long-lasting repercussions {{in the history of}} the East Slavs, and the Empire quickly became the main trading and cultural partner for Kiev. The Rus' launched their first attack against Constantinople in 860, pillaging the suburbs of the city. In 941, they appeared on the Asian shore of the Bosphorus, but this time they were crushed, an indication of the improvements in the Byzantine military position after 907, when only diplomacy had been able to push back the invaders. Basil II could not ignore the emerging power of the Rus', and, following the example of his predecessors, he used religion as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>for</b> the achievement of political purposes. Rus'–Byzantine relations became closer following the marriage of Anna Porphyrogeneta to Vladimir the Great in 988, and the subsequent Christianisation of the Rus'. Byzantine priests, architects, and artists were invited to work on numerous cathedrals and churches around Rus', expanding Byzantine cultural influence even further, while numerous Rus' served in the Byzantine army as mercenaries, most notably as the famous Varangian Guard.|$|E
5|$|Caragiale {{returned}} to Bucharest: in summer 1912, {{with help from}} journalist Rudolf Uhrinowsky, the young writer was employed by a French-language gazette, L'Indépendence Roumaine, informing his readers that he had also become the sole legitimate Caragiale family representative in Romania. In October, he became {{the chief of staff}} in the Ministry of Public Works in the second Titu Maiorescu executive, under Minister Alexandru Bădărău. He had manifested a relative interest in politics around 1908, after his father rallied with Take Ionescu and his Conservative-Democratic Party; at the time, he criticized Ion Luca's political choices, but nonetheless noted that it could serve as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>for</b> his own advancement ("From now on I'll have political lode , something certain, if there ever was certainty on Earth.") Four years after this comment, soon after making his literary debut, he clashed with his father over having considered a cabinet appointment in Ionescu's executive.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{disagree}} with the government's justifications for introducing the GRC scheme, noting {{that the proportion of}} minority MPs per GRC has decreased with the advent of five-member and six-member GRCs. By having teams of candidates standing for election for GRCs helmed by senior politicians, the ruling People's Action Party has also used GRCs as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>for</b> bringing first-time candidates into Parliament. Moreover, the GRC scheme is also said to disadvantage opposition parties because it is more difficult for them to find enough candidates to contest GRCs. Furthermore, it is said that the GRC scheme means that electors have unequal voting power, weakens the relationship between electors and MPs, and entrenches racialism in Singapore politics.|$|E
5|$|For the actress, having Chloe {{become part}} of the meteor {{infected}} community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>for</b> her character to become more emotionally connected to those people—the meteor infected—she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation to try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand {{what it feels like to}} live in a world where you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois's presence at the Daily Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most important to her – her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to bring out the best in herself.|$|E
5|$|Further {{social changes}} {{brought about by}} the {{presence}} of American military personnel were exemplified in the storm's wake. The use of currency as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>for</b> obtaining goods was first seen in Ulithi in 1956, four years before the typhoon. However, despite the total destruction of markets by Ophelia they were quickly rebuilt, depicting the quick entrenchment of currency in native culture. The reconstruction also accelerated a desire for new goods from trading. Store owners requested a wider range of material to have in stock than seen previously. From a societal standpoint, Ophelia prompted great advances in the Ulithian culture. Women, previously limited to agriculture, housework, and eventually shopping, were found to be doing heavy work (i.e. carpentry, chopping, digging, and lifting) in the immediate wake of the typhoon. A shift in government took place as well, with authority of King Malefich waning to greater power among younger individuals. Malefich also displayed great ineptitude during the storm and was subsequently disposed of as King following Ophelia's passage. The changes in authority occurred due to spontaneous leadership during the storm by the younger persons in order to protect others. Prior to the typhoon, younger members of tribes never spoke during council meetings; however, by 1961 they made their presence known in such meetings.|$|E
