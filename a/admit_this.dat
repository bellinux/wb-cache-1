25|$|Miley is {{especially}} close with her father, from whom she receives much good advice and emotional support. She also values her relationships with her best friends Lilly and Oliver. However Miley {{is shown to}} be very uncomfortable {{with the fact that}} they're dating and even stops them from being a couple. Her relationship with Lilly occasionally suffers the occasional setback, but they always make up. In the episode 'What I Don't Like About You', Miley is asked to choose a side between a fight Lilly and Oliver had. But Miley, showing what a kind friend she was, made a mini-Indiana Joannie movie, which made Lilly and Oliver forgive each other. Miley's relationship with her brother Jackson is often hostile. The two siblings constantly fight and trash talk each other. However, in a few private conversations, both Miley and Jackson say that they love and appreciate each other, but they are both unwilling to <b>admit</b> <b>this</b> in public.|$|E
25|$|The 20th-century Reform rabbi {{and author}} Gunther Plaut argued that Isaac {{was not really}} deceived. Reading the story with close {{attention}} to the personality of Isaac, Plaut concluded that throughout the episode, Isaac was subconsciously aware of Jacob's identity, but, as he was unable to <b>admit</b> <b>this</b> knowledge, he pretended to be deceived. Plaut thus saw a plot within a plot, as Rebekah and Jacob laid elaborate plans for deceiving Isaac, while unknown to them Isaac looked for a way to deceive himself, in order to carry out God's design to bless his less-loved son. Plaut argued that Isaac was old but not senile. In his heart, Isaac had long known that Esau could not carry on the burden of Abraham and that, instead, he had to choose his quiet and complicated younger son Jacob. In Plaut's reading, weak and indecisive man and father that Isaac was, {{he did not have the}} courage to face Esau with the truth. His own blindness and Rebekah's ruse came literally as a godsend. Plaut noted that Isaac did not reprimand Jacob. Plaut concluded that no one, not even Esau, was deceived, for even Esau knew that Jacob was the chosen one.|$|E
500|$|... "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] is a mid-tempo R and doo-wop ballad {{reminiscent}} of the 1950s music that incorporates Motown and teen pop influences. Similar in style to songs recorded by American girl groups The Ronettes and The Supremes, its lyrics about denying having romantic feelings for someone parody those of traditional love songs. In its accompanying musical sequence, Meg realizes that she has reluctantly begun {{to fall in love}} with Hercules but constantly refuses to <b>admit</b> <b>this.</b> Meanwhile, the Muses insist that she stop denying her feelings for him and embrace them instead. [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] was written to replace a slower, more emotional ballad Menken had originally intended for Meg, entitled [...] "I Can't Believe My Heart"; the song was discarded because Meg's animator Ken Duncan felt that it did not compliment her strong personality. Menken based [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] on songs he had written for his musical Little Shop of Horrors (1982).|$|E

He spoke to some patients in the hospital, commending the physically wounded. He then approached Kuhl, who {{did not appear to be}} physically injured. Kuhl was sitting slouched on a stool midway through a tent ward filled with injured soldiers. When Patton asked Kuhl where he was hurt, Kuhl reportedly shrugged and replied that he was [...] "nervous" [...] rather than wounded, adding, [...] "I guess I can't take it." [...] Patton [...] "immediately flared up," [...] slapped Kuhl across the chin with his gloves, then grabbed him by the collar and dragged him to the tent entrance. He shoved him out of the tent with a kick to his backside.

500|$|Jennifer Armstrong of Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} when O'Malley told Torres about his affair with Stevens, the scene was too [...] "melodramatic". Laura Burrows, also of IGN, said that the fourth-season premiere [...] "introduced a new side of George". Armstrong said of O'Malley and Stevens' reconciliation: [...] "George and Izzie are finally on the old Grey's Anatomy road to ruin. And I <b>admit</b> <b>this</b> is a good lesson in Grey's viewing as well as life: Sit tight if you hate something, as nothing is permanent." [...] Armstrong also commented that the [...] "sparkling" [...] {{friendship}} development between Lexie and O'Malley [...] "won her over". The following year, Monfette observed of O'Malley's lack of screen time: [...] "His growing interest in trauma surgery {{at the side of}} Owen leads to an interesting development in the finale, but the character is virtually side-lined this season." [...] Carina MacKenzie of the Los Angeles Times said of the character's death: [...] "The time-lapse episode was an interesting choice, and though we sped through six weeks of mourning in two hours, it didn't feel rushed to me. I'm not sure the show could have held my attention for another season of crippling sadness." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{early and}} very {{influential}} modern historian, George Grote, {{set the tone}} by expressing incredulity at the numbers given by Herodotus: [...] "To <b>admit</b> <b>this</b> overwhelming total, or anything near to it, is obviously impossible." [...] Grote's main objection is the supply problem, though he does not analyse the problem in detail. He did not reject Herodotus's account altogether, citing the latter's reporting of the Persians' careful methods of accounting and their stockpiling of supply caches for three years, but {{drew attention to the}} contradictions in the ancient sources. A later influential historian, J. B. Bury, calls Herodotus's numbers [...] "wholly fabulous" [...] and judges that the Persian land forces may have been 180,000. [...] A major limiting factor for the size of the Persian army, first suggested by Sir Frederick Maurice (a British transport officer) is the supply of water. Maurice suggested in the region of 200,000 men and 70,000 animals could have been supported by the rivers in that region of Greece. He further suggested that Herodotus may have confused the Persian terms for chiliarchy (1,000) and myriarchy (10,000), leading to an exaggeration by a factor of ten. Other early modern scholars estimated that the land forces participating in the invasion at 100,000 soldiers or less, based on the logistical systems available to the Ancients.|$|E

It was at this stage that former teammate Pizzonia returned to racing as a replacement for the injured Ralf Schumacher and accused Jaguar of favouritism towards Webber during their time as teammates saying that Webber received new car parts one or two races before Pizzonia. The claims were categorically denied by Jaguar boss David Pitchforth, and whilst Webber did not publicly comment on the situation at the time he had his best result of the season finishing sixth in the , running ahead of Pizzonia for the entire race. Meanwhile, reports emerged that Jaguar could not guarantee that they would compete in Formula One for the 2005 season and on 28 July, it was announced that Webber would drive for WilliamsF1 for 2005 and beyond. He would later <b>admit</b> <b>this</b> was the team that his [...] "heart was always set on".

500|$|The Japanese {{name of the}} series, , became officially romanized as New Super Android Cutey Honey or New Cutey Honey. It {{has also}} been spelled with [...] "Cutie" [...] instead of [...] "Cutey". Unlike the {{original}} Cutie Honey, the series is an [...] "OVA" [...] (original video animation), one made for home video formats such as VHS tape. OVAs {{are known for their}} higher quality than anime television series, and Toei felt the new Honey was especially high-quality because (according to them) each episode used ten thousand cels, three times the usual number. By November 1994, series planner Naoko Takahashi said that Honey was tentatively set to last twelve episodes, with more to be considered later, but the series was cut short at the eighth episode, released in late November 1995. [...] Several scenes in that episode have unshaded foregrounds, partly drawn characters with missing legs, or both. A script for a planned ninth episode was produced as a drama CD voiced by the series' original voice actors. Its English dub, made by ADV Films in 1998, features Jessica Calvello, who was hand-picked by Nagai to perform the voice of Honey. In a post at the Anime on DVD forums, voice actor and writer George Manley—who has worked for the Houston-based ADV—praised both Neya and Calvello's work in Honey as examples of [...] "impressive" [...] performances, and said that the series, whose dub was released four years before he began voice work, [...] "was the title, and I often <b>admit</b> <b>this,</b> that brought me back to watching anime and started me on a long road to, 'Wow, I wonder what might happen if I moved to Houston....|$|E
500|$|In 1936, Feller {{was signed}} by Cy Slapnicka, a scout for the Indians, for one dollar and an autographed baseball. While {{scouting}} Feller, Slapnicka said, [...] "This was a kid pitcher I had to get. I knew he was something special. His fastball was fast and fuzzy; it didn't go in a straight line; it would wiggle and shoot around. I didn't know then that he was smart and had {{the heart of a}} lion, but I knew that I was looking at an arm the likes of which you see only once in a lifetime." [...] Feller was assigned to the Fargo-Moorhead Twins and was to report there after finishing the high school semester. Slapnicka was later named general manager of the Indians and transferred Feller's contract from Fargo-Moorhead to the New Orleans Pelicans. He was planning to add Feller, along with outfielder Tommy Henrich, to the major league roster after a few exhibition and semi-pro games without visiting either farm club. By doing so, the Indians would be in violation of Major League Baseball's rule stating that, at the time, only minor league teams could sign amateur baseball players to contracts. After a three-month investigation, concluding in December 1936, about whether the Indians broke any Major League Baseball rules by signing Feller, Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis disagreed with the argument presented by Slapnicka and Indians president Alva Bradley, but awarded both Feller and Henrich free agency and required the club to pay a $7,500 fine. Landis made the decision partly due to the testimony of Feller and his father, who wanted his son to play for Cleveland and who had also told Landis he would take the issue to court. Feller elected to remain with the Indians but Henrich joined the New York Yankees. Sports columnist Joe Williams wrote, [...] "For $7500 the Cleveland Indians received $500,000 worth of publicity. ...

500|$|The lyrics on Riot Act {{were more}} direct than on {{preceding}} records, {{in response to}} the political climate after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Bassist Jeff Ament commented that he felt that love was a major theme of the album, and Vedder tried to convey themes such as love, loss and struggle to make a difference because of the difficulty in leading with events such as the September 11 attacks and the accidental death of nine fans during Pearl Jam's performance at the 2000 Roskilde Festival – [...] "You start feeling like, 'What do I have to say? What is my opinion?' Then I realized I did have an opinion. Not only did I have one, but I felt like it was formed by processing a lot of information and having good influences. Ament also told that [...] "I think the time's right to turn our voice up a bit [...] And Ed did it in a great way, with humour and a mystical, magical approach. It isn't just, 'We're pissed off, and fuck you! Riot! Anarchy!' Cos I don't think that's the method. At least at this point." [...] Vedder, however, said, [...] "I have to <b>admit</b> <b>this</b> record came out a bit one-sided. But I think we as a country need to understand why we're involved in the Middle East. This hollow patriotism frightens me." [...] The singer added that the Riot Act lyrics [...] "represent my state of mind these days. I'm optimistic yet disillusioned, hopeful yet frustrated." [...] Several songs on the album were inspired by Roskilde tragedy, with the album's first single, [...] "I Am Mine", being written by Vedder in 2000 in a hotel room before the band's first show after Roskilde, and [...] "Love Boat Captain" [...] including a brief lyrical reference ("Lost nine friends we'll never know... two years ago today"). Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, [...] "There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing.
