The main objective of research consisted in development of combination of coal dust and natural peat without binding additives. The role of peat consists that it increases efficiency of process of granulation, being natural binding. The method of granulation allows to utilize waste {{of the coal}} industry. Joint burning of two types of fuel – coal dust and peat reduces emission of sulfur dioxides. The cost of peat raw materials is lower, than artificial binding, applied to briquetting of coal dust. The composition of mix of coal dust and peat varied in the ratio 2 : 1, 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 in volume ratio at humidity of mix before extrusion of 65  %. In the course of preparatory operations of coal raw materials its crushing and sifting through sieve of 24 mesh (0, 707  mm) was carried out. Procedure of hashing of samples of coal and peat was carried out before receiving homogeneous mixture. After hashing mix was located in piston press for receiving granules. Coal dust and wet peat pass semifixed extrusion on piston press with formation of cylindrical granules with a diameter of 16 mm. After extrusion of granule are dried to operational humidity of 25  %.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the effect of alkali {{adsorption}} on the agglomeration of particles of bauxite, kaolinite, emathlite, lime, and two types of coal <b>ash.</b> An <b>agglomeration</b> (adhesion) temperature is defined which characterizes the adhesion propensity of particles. Using a small fluidized bed, a unique experimental technique is developed to measure this agglomeration point in-situ. The effects of alkali adsorption on the agglomeration characteristics of the substrates are determined. The agglomeration temperature of all substrates decreases as the alkali content increases. At low alkali loadings, alkali adsorption enhances particle agglomeration by forming new compounds of lower melting points. At high alkali concentrations, adhesion and agglomeration are caused by a layer of molten alkali which covers the exterior of the particles. Alkali surface composition of particles is studied using a Scanning Auger Microprobe (SAM). Results indicate that the alkali surface concentration decreases as agglomeration temperature increases. SAM depth profiling data provides information on the variations of alkali loading across particles. These results show that an alkali surface product layer is formed where most of the alkali adsorbed is concentrated. The use of additives to scavenge alkali vapors is further studied in a pilot scale downflow combustor under more typical combustion conditions. SAM surface analyses of additive particles indicate three mechanisms of alkali capture. Alkali adsorption by reaction, alkali surface condensation, and alkali nucleation and coagulation with additive particles. These mechanisms may occur independently or simultaneously depending primarily on the alkali vapor concentration and the temperature profile along the combustion furnace. A mathematical model is developed to represent the kinetics and mechanisms of the alkali adsorption and agglomeration process. Modeling results indicate that the adsorption-reaction process is influenced by diffusion of alkali through the surface product layer. The model predictions of the alkali adsorbed as a function of minimum agglomeration temperature agree very well with the experimental results. Alkali-additive interactions in a downflow combustor are also modeled to predict the mechanisms of alkali capture and the overall alkali removal efficiency. Model predictions of the alkali capture agree well with the experimental results...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} fuel {{properties}} on ash deposition behaviour in a coal fired Rotary kiln, used for preparing iron rich pellets from virgin iron ore, was examined using simulated combustion conditions {{combined with a}} range of analytical techniques. A new index based on ash melting during thermo-mechanical analysis of coal ash is developed to predict ash deposition potential in a Rotary kiln, and related to ash deposition trend near the kiln entrance. Iron dust was found to consist of mainly hematite. Iron dust presence in coal increases <b>ash</b> <b>agglomeration</b> tendency such that agglomeration intensity increases with increasing concentration of iron dust. The study also established that intensity of iron dust impact is influenced by parent coal chemistry such that iron and calcium rich coals displayed greater intensity of iron dust impact. It seems external iron presence has a stronger effect on <b>ash</b> <b>agglomeration</b> compared to inherent coal iron minerals as confirmed by TMA index and ash agglomerate plot. The interfacial examination of iron dust and ash particles did not show any apparent evidence of chemical interactions which implies that iron dust mainly participated physically for the evolution of agglomerate at least under tested conditions. This suggests that in Rotary kiln, inertial impaction of iron dust may be determining intensity of deposit formation. Increasing kaolinite concentration in coal did not show any apparent change on the agglomeration tendency for low to medium slagging coals. It is possible that due to smaller particle size and lower density, their contribution to possible inertial impaction may be not significant. The study further highlighted that increase in mullite presence in high slagging coals mainly seems to be attributed to addition of external kaolinite in specimens. Like iron dust, kaolinite particles did not appear to show any chemical interaction with coal ash particles, even though occurs as mullite in the agglomerate. The interfacial studies supported the ash deposition prediction based on TMA index such that coals with high TMA index displayed high agglomeration index with exception of kaolinite rich coals. The study suggests that physical properties of coal minerals particularly iron bearing phases in coals may have strong effect on the growth of agglomeration. Therefore, future studies may focus on establishing the effect of physical properties of additive as well as variation of coal mineral chemistry with coal grain size...|$|E
40|$|The {{combustion}} {{of biomass}} could {{in some cases}} lead to ash problems induced by high temperatures such as <b>ash</b> sintering, <b>agglomeration</b> and melting.

Addition of additives in the problematic fuels is a possible measure {{in order to reduce the}} ash problems. This project studies the effect of some additives in a problematic wood pellet fuel and wheat straw. The wood pellet consist of residues from the furniture industry in the Møre area in Norway, and is causing ash problems in several boilers using this fuel. The additives, clay, sewage sludge, marble sludge and paper sludge, are added in 3 to 10 percent addition in the problematic fuels. The melting temperatures of the resulting ash, as well as the sintering tendency of the different fuel and additive mixtures, are analyzed. Melting experiments showed that the melting temperature of wood and straw ash was drastically increased by adding sewage and marble sludge. Clay was more effective for wheat straw than wood pellet. Paper sludge increased the melting temperature to some extent for straw ash, but not for wood pellet. The sintering test revealed an increased sintering for wood pellet with sewage sludge, and a much higher slagging tendency for clay. Marble sludge effectively decreased the sintering of wood pellet ash, even at 1200 °C. Paper sludge did neither reduce the sintering. All additives showed a positive effect on the wheat straw ash sintering, with marble sludge as the indisputable best additive.

40|$|Co-combustion {{of animal}} {{carcasses}} and slaughterhouse waste products (animal waste), which are classed as high-risk infectious waste, {{has been considered}} as a “fuel opportunity” for waste-to-energy boilers. In this study, the impact of co-combustion of animal waste with municipal solid waste (MSW) on operational issues such as bed agglomeration, deposit formation and emission was investigated, employing experimental and theoretical methods. In the experimental section, a series of full-scale tests in a bubbling fluidised-bed boiler were carried out, {{to determine the effects}} of animal waste co-combustion on the issues addressed. Two combustion scenarios were considered, identified as the reference (Ref) case and the animal waste (AW) case. In the Ref case, a solid-waste fuel mix, consisting of sorted and pretreated industry and household waste was combusted. In the AW case, 20 wt% AW was added to the reference fuel mix. The collected samples, which included super-heater deposits, fuel mixes and bed and fly ashes, were analysed, using chemical fractionation, SEM-EDX and XRD. In addition, the flue gases´ emission rate were continuously analysed, using FTIR spectrometry. The results showed positive effects from co-combustion of AW, indicating decreased deposit formation and lower risk of bed agglomeration, as well as reduced emissions of NOx and SO 2. Moreover, it was found that the concentrations of P, Ca, S and Cl were enriched in the bed materials. In the theoretical section, thermodynamic calculations, with respect to experimental data, were performed to provide greater understanding of the ash transformation behaviour and the related melting temperature. The calculations mainly focused on bed agglomeration, where addition of AW to the MSW considerably reduced the risk of agglomeration. The results of equilibrium products and phase diagram information for the bed <b>ashes</b> suggested melt-induced <b>agglomeration</b> as a possible cause of the formation of sticky layers on the bed particle in the Ref case.

40|$|Because of {{the shift}} in {{agriculture}} from extensive towards intensive livestock production, in many regions the supply of livestock manure exceeds the demand for nutrients (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus, {{and to a lesser}} extent potassium) by crops. Land spreading on agricultural soil is to date still common practice for livestock manure, but may sometimes lead to excessive fertilization of agricultural land, causing environmental problems, e. g. eutrophication. Alternative treatment options are thus needed for large quantities of manure in the EU- 28. Combustion of poultry litter, which is a combination of poultry excrements, feathers and bedding material of the stables, in large-scale facilities is feasible because this biomass is relatively dry (less than 45 % of moisture), resulting in a lower heating value of approximately 7 MJ/kg. After combustion, typically in a fluidized bed combustor, recovery of the thermal energy of the hot flue gas in a steam boiler allows the production of renewable, biogenic electricity. The carbon from the poultry litter is biogenic, and therefore the emitted CO 2 has no net environmental impact. Moreover, production of electricity avoids the emissions that would have occurred when electricity was generated by fossil fuel combustion. Taking into account the production of auxiliary materials (e. g. lime for flue gas cleaning) and combustion of auxiliary fuels in the poultry litter combustor, the electricity from 1 Mg of poultry litter avoids greenhouse gas emissions corresponding to almost 600 kg of CO 2 equivalents, when it replaces electricity from coal combustion. Assuming that the electricity produced from poultry litter combustion replaces electricity from natural gas instead of coal, still more than 240 kg of CO 2 equivalents of greenhouse gas emissions are avoided. In contrast, land spreading, the traditional treatment method for manure, does not recover energy from the manure, and therefore the greenhouse gas emissions from the poultry litter spread on land, mainly N 2 O, result in an increase of the overall greenhouse gas emissions with between 30 kg and 450 kg of CO 2 equivalents per Mg, depending on several factors, such as soil type, season and weather. The production of renewable, biogenic electricity in the case of poultry litter combustion, results also in a lower impact in the categories terrestrial acidification, particulate matter formation, eutrophication and fossil depletion, than in the case of land spreading. The combustion ash, containing all of the phosphorus and potassium from the initial poultry litter, can be recycled as an inorganic soil conditioner (this ash is also called a slow release PK-fertilizer). The nitrogen, mainly present as NH 3 and urea in the poultry litter, is volatilized during the combustion process, and mainly converted to harmless N 2 gas, which is emitted to the atmosphere. To compensate the loss of this nutrient, mineral N-fertilizer such as NH 4 NO 3 with an equal amount of nitrogen as the initial poultry litter could be added to the ash. The production of this NH 4 NO 3 causes the emission of 188 kg of CO 2 equivalents of greenhouse gases per Mg of poultry litter combusted, which is lower than the savings from the electricity production. So, even in this scenario, combustion of poultry litter overall avoids emissions of greenhouse gases, and has therefore a lower environmental impact in the category climate change than land spreading. However, the high phosphorus and potassium concentrations of the ash, which are beneficial in respect to ash recycling as a soil conditioner, may be detrimental to the operation of a fluidized bed combustor, typically used for biomass combustion. Previous research showed that for most types of biomass, having a higher potassium concentration (5 - 15 wt% of the ash) than for instance coal (0. 5 - 3 wt% of the ash), the formation of low melting potassium silicates could result in <b>agglomeration</b> of bed <b>ash,</b> potentially leading to loss of fluidization (defluidization) and subsequent shutdown of the installation. Bed ash consists of the initially added silica sand particles that are coated with ash. Previous reports in literature also showed that, apart from low melting potassium silicates, also potassium and calcium phosphates with a low melting point may be formed in combustion <b>ash</b> and cause <b>agglomeration.</b> However, both silicates and phosphates of potassium and calcium were experimentally observed in combustion ash formed in specific conditions, but it was not clear which salt is formed in which conditions, and which melt dominates in biomass ash. Moreover, thermodynamics did not allow to predict the presence of ternary silicate salts (e. g. CaO-K 2 O-SiO 2 salts) and many phosphate salts, as most databases are incomplete. In this thesis, an appropriate set of thermodynamic data was selected to predict the presence of binary salts of the four major ash elements (Ca, K, P, Si). Thermodynamic data on ternary silicate and phosphate salts and on liquid phases were not used, due to their incompleteness, but these salts and liquids were predicted by using existing phase diagrams. In these phase diagrams (of CaO-K 2 O-SiO 2 and CaO-K 2 O-P 2 O 5) the formed binary salts were plotted (instead of the total element composition, as was done in previous reports), together with a potential excess of unreacted SiO 2, which is abundant due to the use of silica sand as bed material. This means that, as an example, only the fraction of calcium that reacted to calcium phosphate is plotted in the CaO-K 2 O-P 2 O 5 phase diagram, and only the fraction of calcium that reacted to calcium silicate is plotted in the CaO-K 2 O-SiO 2 phase diagram. This simplified method showed a good agreement with experimental observations and is less susceptible to inaccurate thermodynamic data of complex ternarysalts. It was found that, during fluidized bed combustion of biomass with a high phosphorus concentration, using silica sand as bed material, potassium silicates are preferentially formed over phosphates. These potassium silicates may mix with calcium silicates, and form ternary silicates. Silicate mixtures with a low calcium concentration, and thus rich in potassium, may have very low melting points (e. g. lower than 740 C, which is as low as the typical bed temperature of about 700 C to 750 C), and hence cause agglomeration. However, calcium silicates are thermodynamically less stable than calcium phosphates, with Ca 3 (PO 4) 2 being the most stable form. A high phosphorus concentration in the <b>ash</b> therefore enhances <b>agglomeration</b> by lowering the amount of high melting calcium silicates through formation of Ca 3 (PO 4) 2. These findings were confirmed by lab agglomeration experiments, in which the concentrations of the four main elements were increased separately in ash samples, after which the samples were subjected to a heat treatment in a muffle furnace. Agglomeration occurred due to the high potassium silicate concentration in the bed ash coatings. This mechanism is called coating induced agglomeration. During the lab agglomeration experiments, a second agglomeration mechanism was discovered, which is called melt induced agglomeration. When H 2 PO 4 - or HPO 42 - salts, which are also present in poultry litter, were added to the bed ash samples, to increase the phosphorus concentration, these salts firstly melted, and then decomposed and reacted with calcium compounds from the ash coatings to form solid Ca 3 (PO 4) 2. The molten reactant (H 2 PO 4 - or HPO 42 - salt) is responsible for agglomeration of the bed ash, but the formation of Ca 3 (PO 4) 2 causes the initially liquid interparticle bridge to solidify. From the experimental and thermodynamic findings, it appeared that the addition of a calcium salt reduces agglomeration problems. This was also shown in earlier reports, but in this thesis it was demonstrated that the added calcium compound firstly reacts with phosphorus salts in the ash to form Ca 3 (PO 4) 2, and only then the excess can effectively react with silica to form high melting calcium silicates, increasing the melting point of the CaO-K 2 O-SiO 2 mixture. Based on these findings, an agglomeration index was developed, to quantitatively determine the amount of calcium salts to be added to avoid agglomeration. The proposed countermeasure, addition of a calcium salt, was applied to a full-scale poultry litter fired fluidized bed combustor. During the test, the silica sand bed material was partially replaced by CaCO 3, which decomposes in the fluidized bed to CO 2 and reactive CaO. Based on continuous measurements of the pressure drop over the fluidized bed, combined with the value of the agglomeration index, it was shown that the reactive CaO counteracted both agglomeration mechanisms. Coating induced agglomeration was counteracted by the formation of calcium silicates, increasing the melting point of the CaO-K 2 O-SiO 2 mixture in the bed <b>ash.</b> Melt induced <b>agglomeration</b> was counteracted by the presence of small CaO particles, which can react with liquid H 2 PO 4 - or HPO 42 - salts to form solid Ca 3 (PO 4) 2, thus avoiding interactions of these liquid salts with bed ash particles. This thesis shows that by applying this countermeasure, sustainable electricity can beproduced from manure by fluidized bed combustion, without severe technological problems. status: publishe...|$|R

MBM was mixed with peat at 6 levels between 15 % and 100 %. Emissions were predominantly below regulatory limits.

SO 2 emissions were found to be over the limit of 50 mg/m 3, while in all trials NOx emissions were below the limit of 300 mg/m 3.

Fluidised bed combustion is a fuel-flexible technology, capable of burning waste coal with reduced nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide emissions. The objective of this research was to evaluate the combustibility of high-ash coals in a bubbling fluidised bed combustor. This study proposed that high ash coal will combust in the BFBC with reduced emissions as well as without <b>ash</b> <b>agglomeration.</b> The research carried out entailed coal and limestone analysis (chemical, elemental and mineral analysis), coal combustion tests in a pilot scale BFBC facility (at different combustion temperatures and different limestone feedrates), fly ash analysis (elemental and mineral quantifications) and data consolidation. On average, fly ashes from the three coals tested had a carbon fraction lower than 0. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{conceptual}} compartmented, fluidized-bed {{coal gasifier}} (CFBCG) which separates coal combustion from gasification for synthesis gas production {{was investigated in}} a small pilot plant in two major stages combustion-only experiments and combustion-gasification experiments. The combustion-only experiments showed that volatiles were released and burned in the compartment where coal is fed. Volatiles and char combustion were sufficient to maintain the operating temperature of the CFBCG. Solid circulation induced by two sets of v-valve/riser arrangments was cruscial, and determined heat-transfer between the two beds and, thus, controlled the reaction rates. The rate of solid circulation, carbon burning rate, and carbon inventory in a bed were indirectly estimated by measuring pressure drop over a bed compartment. Since there was no ash withdrawal facility in the pilot plant, ash accumulated during prolonged operation and caused <b>ash</b> <b>agglomeration</b> at high temperatures, which further resulted in fluidization and solid circulation difficulties. Based on information and experience obtained in the combustion-only experiments, the combustion-gasification experiments were performed to study energy transfer from combustor to gasifier, {{and quality of the}} synthesis gas produced. It was found that circulation of hot solids from the combustor was sufficient to support endothermic reactions in the gasifier. High-quality synthesis gas with an H/CO ratio of 4 was achieved. N contamination of the synthesis gas (12 - 22 %) occurred due to air leakage from the riser and in the plenum to the gasifier. While the CFBCG concept has proved to be sound, further development is needed to improve the operatibility before practical application...|$|E
40|$|Some {{highlights}} are: (1) During this quarter's field trials, {{sand mold}} castings of parts and permanent mold tensile testing bars, K mold bars, and ingots {{were made from}} aluminum alloy-fly ash melts. (2) Another objective was met, i. e., to use class ''F'' type precipitator fly ash consisting of particle sizes less than 100 microns. It was possible to pour the composite melt into the sand mold through a filter. (3) Trials were run to determine the required amount of the wetting agent, magnesium, to ensure appropriate mixing of the aluminum alloy and fly ash. The magnesium content required to mix ''F'' fly ash was much lower compared to that required to mix hybrid ''C-F'' fly ash in similar melts. Fly ash particles of less than 100 microns were mixed in aluminum melt. Large scale field trials were undertaken at Eck Industries {{with the goal of}} standardizing procedures for producing aluminum-fly ash composite melts and to analyze the structure and properties of the resulting material. Limited testing of tensile properties has been done on pressure die cast parts, and attempts are underway to improve the distribution of fly ash in both sand cast and pressure die cast samples. Eck Industries performed radiographic, heat treatment, and tensile tests on permanent mold cast tensile test bars. After fly ash mixing experiments, the Lanxide high speed-high shear mixer (originally designed for mixing Al-SiC melts) was employed in an attempt to avoid fly <b>ash</b> <b>agglomeration.</b> It led to demixing (instead of deagglomerating) of some fly ash. However, the permanent mold tensile bars poured after high shear mixing displayed good distribution of fly ash in castings. A modified impeller design is being considered for high speed-high shear mixing of aluminum-fly ash melts...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this report}} are to produce and evaluate the use of aluminum ''ashalloys'' [...] metal matrix composites that incorporate coal fly ash [...] in the commercial manufacture of cast automotive parts. Some highlights are: (1) Ashalloy ingot with ''C'' type fly ash was synthesized using stir casting techniques similar to the successful castings of ''F'' type fly <b>ash.</b> <b>Agglomeration</b> was noted. Stirring periods were increased up to 45 minutes compared to the normal 5 minutes {{to determine whether the}} shear force of stirring would disagglomerate the clusters noted with this type of fly ash. The resulting sample showed clustering. (2) The ashalloy ingots of ''C'' type fly ash were remelted and poured into permanent molds using a cloth filter to screen out clusters. There was no major reduction in clusters of fly ash particles in the composite since the filter with the mesh size larger than 1 x 1 mm was used. The composite melt would not flow through when filters with smaller openings were used. (3) The fly ash sample from Wisconsin Electric Power Company was sent for classification. (4) A 1 lb. sample of JTM-processed fly ash was sent to Wisconsin Electric Power Company for classification and 10 lb. of same fly ash was sent to The Jet Pulverizer Company for jet milling. (5) Experiments on fly ash pretreatment as well as synthesis of ash alloy are continuing. (6) Attempts are being made to apply high speed shear mixing with selected liquids to disperse the clusters noted in ashalloy with the ''C'' type fly ash base. Stir casting processes have been developed to incorporate type ''F'' fly ash of different sizes and measuring tensile data on cast bars. This data enables selection of the optimum size of fly ash to meet specific property requirements. Attempts are underway to develop stir casting techniques to incorporate ''C'' type fly ash in cast aluminum alloys. It is expected that the next milestone for making trial parts will be completed on schedule by June 1999...|$|E
40|$|Biomass {{is one of}} the {{renewable}} and {{non-conventional energy}} sources and it includes municipal solid wastes and animal wastes in addition to agricultural residue. Concentrated animal feeding operations produce large quantities of cattle biomass which might result in land and water pollution if left untreated. Different methods are employed to extract the available energy from the cattle biomass (CB) which includes co-firing and gasification. There are two types of CB: Feedlot biomass (FB), animal waste from feedlots and dairy biomass (DB), animal waste from dairy farms. Experiments were performed in the part on gasification of both FB and DB. Earlier studies on gasification of DB with different steam-fuel ratios resulted in increased production of hydrogen. In the present study, dairy biomass was gasified in a medium with enriched oxygen percentage varying from 24 % to 28 %. The effect of enriched air mixture, equivalence ratio and steam-fuel ratio on the performance of gasifier was studied. Limited studies were done using a mixture of carbon dioxide and oxygen as the gasification medium and also a methodology was developed to determine the gasification efficiency based on mass and heat contents of gas. The results show that the peak temperature within the bed increases with increase in oxygen concentration in the gasification medium. Also carbon dioxide concentration in the mixture increases with corresponding decrease in carbon monoxide with increase in oxygen concentration of the incoming gasification medium. The peak temperature increased from 988 ?C to 1192 ?C as the oxygen concentration increased from 21 % to 28 % at ER= 2. 1. The upper limit on oxygen concentration is limited to 28 % due to high peak temperature and resulting <b>ash</b> <b>agglomeration.</b> Higher heating value (HHV) of the gases decreases with increase in equivalence ratio. The gases produced using carbon dioxide and oxygen mixture had a higher HHV when compared to that of air and enriched air gasification. Typically the HHV of the gases increased from 2219 kJ/m? to 3479 kJ/m? when carbon dioxide and oxygen mixture is used for gasification instead of air at ER= 4. 2 in the absence of steam...|$|E
40|$|The {{fluidized}} bed combustion of three pelletized biogenic fuels (sewage Sludge, wood, and straw) {{has been investigated}} {{with a combination of}} experimental techniques. The fuels have been characterized from the standpoints of patterns and rates of fuel devolatilization and char burnout, extent of attrition and fragmentation, and their relevance to the fuel particle size distribution and the amount and size distribution of primary ash particles. Results highlight differences and similarities among the three fuels tested. The fuels were all characterized by limited primary fragmentation and relatively long devolatilization times, as compared with the time scale of particle dispersion away from the fuel feeding ports in practical FBC. Both features are favorable to effective lateral distribution of volatile matter across the combustor cross section. The three fuels exhibited distinctively different char conversion patterns. The high-ash pelletized sludge burned according to the shrinking core conversion pattern with negligible Occurrence of secondary fragmentation. The low-ash pelletized wood burned according to the shrinking particle conversion pattern with extensive occurrence of secondary fragmentation. The medium-ash pelletized straw yielded char particles with a hollow structure, resembling big cenospheres, characterized by a coherent inorganic outer layer strong enough to prevent particle fragmentation. Inert bed particles were permanently attached to the hollow pellets as they were incorporated into ash melts. Carbon elutriation rates were very small for all the fuels tested. For pelletized sludge and straw, this was mostly due to the shielding effect of the coherent ash skeleton. For the wood pellet, carbon attrition was extensive, but was largely counterbalanced by effective afterburning due to the large intrinsic reactivity of attrited char fines. The impact of carbon attrition on combustion efficiency was negligible for all the fuels tested. The size distribution of primary ash particles liberated upon complete carbon burnoff largely reflected the combustion pattern of each fuel. Primary ash particles of size nearly equal to that of the parent fuel were generated upon complete burnoff of the pelletized sludge. Nonetheless, secondary attrition of primary ash from pelletized sludge is large, to the point where generation of fine ash would be extensive over the typical residence time of bed ash in {{fluidized bed}} combustors. Very few and relatively fine primary ash particles were released after complete burnoff of wood pellets. Primary ash particles remaining after complete burnoff of pelletized straw had sizes and shapes that were largely controlled by the Occurrence of <b>ash</b> <b>agglomeration</b> phenomena.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006 Coal is {{a crucial}} {{feedstock}} for South Africa's unique synfuels and petrochemicals industry and used by Sasol as a feedstock to produce synthesis gas via the Sasol-Lurgi Fixed Bed Dry Bottom (FBDB) gasification process. The ash fusion temperature (AFT) gives detail information on the suitability of a coal source for gasification purposes, and specifically to the extent <b>ash</b> <b>agglomeration</b> or clinkering is likely to occur within the gasifier. Ash clinkering inside the gasifier can cause channel burning and unstable operation. Sasol-Lurgi FBDB gasifiers are currently operated with the philosophy of adding an excess of steam to the process to control the H 2 /CO ratio of the syngas produced, but indirectly also to control the maximum gasifier temperature below the AFT of the coal. An opportunity exists to increase the AFT of the coal fed to the gasifiers by adding AFT increasing minerals to the coal blend before it is fed into the gasification process. For {{the aim of this}} study a typical Highveld Nr. 4 coal seam was investigated, as being used by the gasification operations in Secunda. In the drying and devolatilization zone no slag formation in the coal was observed. Based on HT-XRD analysis the predominant phases in the untreated coal sample were quartz, muscovite, calcite, dolomite. hematite. anhydrite, rutile and kaolinite. Kaolinite started to decompose to metakaolinite at ± 450 °C with the formation of amongst others mullite at a temperature of 850 °C to 1000 °C. Mullite formation can also take place if free Al 2 O 3 is present in the coal that can react with free SiO 2. However, free Al 2 O 3 is normally not present in coal and the presence of the aluminasilicate (Al 2 SiO 5) is formed as an intermediate phase due to the decomposition of kaolinite. From 500 °C to 900 °C, the carbonates, calcite and dolomite, started to decompose with the formation of lime and periclase. The feldspar (CaAl 2 Si 2 O 8) observed, formed as a reaction product between the SiO 2, Al 2 O 3 and Ca-containing species present in the coal. In the gasification zone slag-liquid formed at a temperature from 1000 °C. The formation of anhydrite (CaSO 4) took place after the formation of calcite. At 1000 °C anorthite, initially present as feldspar (CaAl 2 Si 2 O 8) and gehlenite (Ca 2 Al 2 SiO 7) became stable, due to partial melting of the low AFT mineral phases. Anorthite and gehlenite were formed as products from anhydrite, alumina and silica at temperatures around 900 °C to 1100 °C. Mullite decomposed at temperatures > 1100 °C, while quartz and anorthite were observed up to 1350 °C. Above 1350 °C the whole mineral phase assemblage in the coal sample was molten. When comparing the base case sample with the Al 2 O 3 -manipulated sample, {{it was clear that the}} mullite is one mineral that showed a significant difference in formation and mechanistic behaviours. In the combustion zone the decrease in the slag-liquid content confirmed the cooling and actual mineral formation and crystallization within the gasifier combustion zone. The representative coal ash, as it was produced after gasification, showed evidence of crystallization from the melt phase and formed due to the interaction of specific mineral species to produce a molten phase that had the correct chemistry to crystallize again. Mullite formation can also take place when free Al 2 O 3 in the coal is available that can react with free SiO 2, also present in the coal. With the addition of y-Al 2 O 3 the free SiO 2 in the coal can react with the y-Al 2 O 3 to form mullite (Al 6 O 5 (SiO 4) 2) directly. The Al 2 O 3 in the reactive form acts as a network former where SiO 2 can be reacted on, to form mullite. The main conclusion of the addition of y-Al 2 O 3 to the blend is that the slag-liquid content decreased with addition, only when the temperature was greater than 1000 oC, which is of importance in Me operating region where the proposed higher gasifier temperature of more than 1250 °C, is aimed for. Another observation from the AFT results was that the AFT was definitely non-additive (not a linear weighted calculated average) and not the weighted average AFT as was expected for the other coal properties such as the ash content, for example. The ash slagging behaviour is a non-additive property of individual coal sources in the blend and therefore difficult to predict. Viscosity modelling can be another tool for predicting slag mineral behaviour and used as a predicting tool, as has been done in this study. A higher viscosity for all relative density fractions were observed for all temperature ranges in comparison with the results obtained from the AFT analysis. In general it can be concluded that the unique opportunity that exists to increase the AFT, was tested, proven and mechanistically outlined in this study on the coal source fed to the Sasol-Lurgi FBDB gasifiers. The AFT can be increased to > 1350 °C by adding AFT increasing minerals or species, for example Al 2 O 3 or other mineral species, to the coal blend before it is fed into the gasification process. By increasing the AFT, the direct effect will be that steam consumption can be decreased, which in tum will improve carbon utilization. Master...|$|E
