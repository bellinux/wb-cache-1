Due to <b>the</b> large amounts <b>of</b> conflicting AMD research on <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> nutrition and antioxidant intake, it is difficult for patients and practitioners to determine which measures can be taken to slow down the disease progression. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> this research was to determine the beliefs and knowledge that patients with AMD have about nutrition, to identify whether their condition is preventing them from eating a healthy diet, and to discover what their diet consists <b>of.</b> For <b>the</b> initial study, 158 participants with AMD (mean age 79 ± 7. 8 years) and 50 participants without AMD (mean age 67 ± 8 years) were recruited from the Macular Society helpline, or from optometric practice. Participants had a 25 minute telephone interview where a 36 -question survey was completed. The survey elicited demographic information, and questions covered the knowledge that participants had on nutrition and their current diet. The results from this survey uncovered three major findings: 1) 100 % of AMD participants felt {{that they do not have}} enough information and support from eye-care practitioners regarding nutrition, 2) AMD patients are confused over, and display a lack of knowledge of, which foods are beneficial for eye health and when and what nutritional supplements to take, evidenced by 65 % of participants not taking the correct dosage 3) AMD patients are not eating enough nutrients that would be beneficial for their condition - consuming an average of 1. 4 mg of lutein and zeaxanthin rather than the recommended 10 mg. A clinical decision-making aid was created as an intervention based upon these findings. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> was to help eye-care practitioners give the correct nutritional advice to their patients. Founded on the AREDS 2 inclusion and exclusion criteria, practitioners are able to identify which patients could benefit from a nutritional supplement, and which patients could benefit from dietary modification. An evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> with 72 qualified eye-care practitioners exhibited a statistically significant increase in confidence after using <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> for two weeks.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{estimate}} <b>the</b> likelihood <b>of</b> axillary {{lymph node}} involvement for patients with early-stage breast cancer, based {{on a variety of}} clinical and pathological factors. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was done in hospital databases from 1999 to 2007. Two hundred thirty-nine patients were diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. Predictive factors, such as patient age, tumor size, lymphovascular invasion, histological grade and immunohistochemical subtype were analyzed to identify variables that may be associated with {{axillary lymph node}} metastasis. RESULTS: Patients with tumors that are negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER 2 had approximately a 90 % lower chance of developing lymph node metastasis than those with luminal A tumors (e. g., ER+ and/or PR+ and HER 2 -) - Odds Ratio: 0. 11; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 01 - 0. 88; p= 0. 01. Furthermore, the risk for lymph node metastasis of luminal A tumors seemed to decrease as patient age increased, and it was directly correlated with tumor size.

40|$|The article {{examines}} the European Commission's use of its legal powers over mergers. It discusses and tests two views. One is that the 'neoliberal' Commission has ended previous industrial policies of aiding 'national champion' firms to grow through mergers and instead pursues a 'merger-constraining' policy of vigorously using its legal powers to block mergers. The other is that the Commission follows an 'integrationist policy' <b>of</b> seeking <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> larger European firms to deepen economic integration. It examines Commission decisions under the 1989 EC Merger Regulation between 1990 and 2009. It selects three major sectors that are 'likely' for the 'merger-constraining' view - banking, energy and telecommunications - and analyses a dataset of almost 600 Commission decisions and then individual merger cases. It finds that the Commission has approved almost all mergers, including by former 'national champion' firms.

40|$|This paper uses ideas {{drawn from}} Wendy Brown’s {{critique}} of neoliberal approaches to governance, {{to argue that}} <b>the</b> ‘economisation’ <b>of</b> social policy such as welfare and legal <b>aid</b> and <b>the</b> family justice system, has resulted in an economic re-making <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ideas <b>of</b> justice, fairness and equality, which have traditionally underpinned these policies and <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family court. The paper will map the political context to <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Legal <b>Aid,</b> Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO hereafter), {{in order to understand}} how it has been possible to justify the cuts to family law that were made under the statute. This will involve considering how attitudes towards social security and welfare have changed, and how a waning commitment to <b>the</b> original <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legal <b>aid</b> scheme has manifested in <b>the</b> specific context <b>of</b> family law. <b>The</b> paper will then explore <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> this approach for the family justice system, specifically the post-LASPO family courtroom. Using recent case reports, the paper will argue that the family court is now ‘dilemmatic’, in that it is now caught between its traditional obligations of safeguarding fairness and equality, and the economic demands which constrain <b>the</b> ability <b>of</b> judges and court staff to ensure those obligations. Having considered the way in which legal <b>aid</b> policy and <b>the</b> family justice system have been approached through a solely economic lens, the paper will finally turn to examine how LASPO itself was justified in this neoliberal context. It will be argued here that <b>the</b> re-made notions <b>of</b> justice, fairness and equality have been repurposed for economic aims, and that this is a symptom of a wider loss <b>of</b> commitment to <b>the</b> original substance <b>of</b> these principles. In understanding how traditional notions of justice have been re-drawn in economic terms, this paper concludes by arguing that family lawyers, practitioners and academics operating in a post-LASPO context must explicitly reject <b>the</b> economic terms <b>of</b> value against which these notions are measured, if their arguments against <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> these cuts are to be in any way effective...|$|R

From the results available, the main conclusions are that the R & P 5400 instruments greatly underread EC and total carbon (TC = OC+EC) at kerbside sites, probably {{due to the fact that}} the smaller particles are not sampled by the instrument; the R & P 5400 instrument is inherently difficult to characterise, so that all quantitative results need to be treated with caution; both aethalometer and Black Smoke (converted to black carbon) measurements can show reasonable agreement with elemental carbon results; and manual thermo-optical OC/EC results may underread EC (and hence overread OC), whether either transmittance or reflectance is used for the pyrolysis correction, and this effect is significant at rural sites...|$|R
40|$|Basic {{theoretical}} background: The hypertension is {{a disease}} in which the blood pressure 140 / 90 mm Hg, and these values are measured at at least two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three measurements. Arterial hypertension is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most common limit disease with a high prevalence in the adult population in industrialized countries. <b>Aims</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis: <b>The</b> <b>aids</b> od <b>the</b> thesis was as to determine whether patients adhere to <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> self-monitoring of blood pressure using a pressure gauge in the upper arm at home. Furthermore, to determine the most common mistakes patients during self monitoring of blood pressure using a pressure gauge in the upper arm at home. These targets were established research questions: Do they adhere to treating patients with hypertension guidelines for <b>the</b> measurement <b>of</b> blood pressure gauge in the upper arm? Are the errors existing in <b>the</b> measurement <b>of</b> blood pressure gauge in the upper arm? The last research question was: What mistakes do occur, <b>the</b> measurement <b>of</b> TK (gauge in the upper arm) in the home environment for patients undergoing treatment with hypertension most often? Methodology: <b>The</b> empirical part <b>of</b> bachelor work was done using the qualitative research, which was chosen for the data collection technique using individual semi-structured interviews, supplemented by observation in patients with hypertension that home blood pressure measurement using the upper arm a tonometer. The data were collected in March 2014 with respondents, who were selected using the snowball technique. The interview included a pre-prepared questions. Answers of respondents have been recorded in the recording sheet and the recording equipment. The observation was made an observation sheet with the criteria and then created a table below describes the criteria for assessing organizations. <b>The</b> group consisted <b>of</b> 8 respondents. There are four men and four women. The respondents {{were familiar with the}} questions in advance and the actual interview was recorded in writing and the recording equipment. All respondents agreed with the observation that took place before the interview. Results: The research results show that more than half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respondents do not comply with dietary measures (see diagram 2). Another category was focused on <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> medication. Five <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eight respondents taking medications regularly Most respondents answered o the question regarding <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> adverse effects {{that they do not have}} side effects. Only two respondents have indicated adverse effects (see diagram 4). The startling finding was that only half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respondents were aware of adverse effects. In <b>the</b> category <b>of</b> blood pressure measurements showed that all except for the respondent 1, other respondents carried out to measure its pressure in the morning and 1 respondent plus two others measurements performed in the evening (see diagram 6). Each of respondent was asked different frequency measurement, only a few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respondents agreed (see diagram 5). This category contained three subsections in which we dealt as <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respondents have <b>the</b> measurement <b>of</b> your blood pressure (see diagram 7) instead of measuring blood pressure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respondents (see diagram 8) and the distance from the elbow cuffs well (see diagram 9). In the last category were identified principles that respondents know for correct measurement of blood pressure (see diagram 10). Conclusion: Arterial hypertension is a very dangerous disease, it is important to have this disease, at least partially controlled by measuring the blood pressure. It is important that all hypertensives knew and adhered to the principles for measuring blood pressure. <b>The</b> result <b>of</b> this work is to evaluate the most common mistakes self-monitoring of blood pressure, hypertensive who have committed in home care. This output should be used to assess and prevent further errors in <b>the</b> measurement <b>of</b> blood pressure, for possible patient education nursing staff...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> this {{research}} {{project is to}} establish <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> events in <b>the</b> survival and sustainability of Historic Houses within <b>the</b> region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scottish Borders.

With the upcoming Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles, 2014 is set to be a significant year for the country. That being said, {{this research}} project focuses on exploring how Historic Houses use events to showcase the House, raise profits and attract people to the heritage visitor attraction, all with <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>aiding</b> <b>the</b> sustainability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House. The following objectives were created in line with the research topic: 1. To explore the heritage tourism industry, focusing on visitor attractions in the Scottish Borders, in order to establish <b>the</b> business environment <b>of</b> Historic Houses. 2. To create an understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attitudes <b>of</b> key professionals towards holding and organising events in Historic Houses as a strategic objective to aid sustainability. 3. To explore <b>the</b> potential <b>of</b> events as an opportunity to showcase Historic Houses as a significant part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local area by researching Historic Houses within the Scottish Borders. A literature review was carried out to establish and summarise the existing literature surrounding <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> events at Historic Houses in the Scottish Borders. Key subjects of this literature review primarily focused on <b>the</b> business environment <b>of</b> Historic Houses, found to be the heritage tourism industry, heritage visitor attractions and special interest tourism. Then <b>the</b> subjects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scottish events industry and events at Historic Houses were evaluated. This allows for gaps in the existing literature to be discovered and noted, thereby creating the background for this study. To fulfil <b>the</b> <b>aims</b> and objectives <b>of</b> this research project, a qualitative research method was utilised. <b>The</b> research method <b>of</b> semi-structured interviews with seven key industry professionals was selected, using the purposive sampling technique. The professionals are employed by various Historic Houses in the Borders and fulfil a key role in organising events or marketing. <b>The</b> main findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research are detailed below: - Preservation of heritage, culture, collections and belongings of Historic Houses are all extremely important aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operating and survival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Houses, often put before the commercial use. - Events are not found to be at <b>the</b> forefront <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strategic objectives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> Historic Houses completing this study.

40|$|The {{need for}} ecosystem-level {{analyses}} is becoming widely recognised following <b>the</b> failure <b>of</b> single-species management in many systems around the world. In order to include multispecies and environmental interactions, ecosystem based fisheries management (EBFM) (known as Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries or EAF in Europe), {{has been put}} forward as a necessary next step for <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> fisheries. Policy regarding EBFM has been produced in Australia, the North Sea and the North Pacific yet <b>the</b> practical application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> approach has not been undertaken in any region. <b>The</b> implementation <b>of</b> EBFM has been slow due to <b>the</b> complexity <b>of</b> ecosystems and <b>the</b> large data needs usually required for ecosystem-level analyses. This study investigates a process of ecosystem analyses with <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>aiding</b> <b>the</b> swift implementation <b>of</b> EBFM. <b>The</b> banded morwong (Cheilodactylus spectabilis) fishery was investigated in this case study due to <b>the</b> large number <b>of</b> non-target species captured {{in addition to the}} target species. The area in which this fishery operates is also important as it is subject to a number of other fisheries, increasing sea surface temperature (SST) and <b>the</b> influx <b>of</b> a number of warm-water invasive species. Ecosystem analyses were undertaken in a number <b>of</b> steps. First, <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spatial scale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ecosystem and its constituents was undertaken using biodiversity survey and commercial catch sampling data. Multivariate statistics were used to identify spatial differences in fish, invertebrate and macroalgal communities between and within the area in which <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> banded morwong fishing occurs. Significant differences in community composition suggested <b>the</b> spatial bounds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inshore reef ecosystem should occur at Eddystone Point (Lat. 40. 99, Long. 148. 35) and south Bruny Island (Lat. 43. 27, Long 146. 99). Commonly captured species were identified using commercial catch sampling data. The species with the highest catch were identified as banded morwong, blue throat wrasse, purple wrasse, draughtboard shark, marblefish, bastard trumpeter and long-snouted boarfish. Commonly sighted fish, invertebrate and algal species were identified using biodiversity surveys. Correlations with environmental data were investigated for invertebrate and algal species and identified a significant positive trend between sea surface temperature and the invasive urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii. A number of data gaps, such as the need for trophic information, and trends for further analysis were also highlighted. The second step undertaken in these analyses was <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> qualitative models to examine <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> banded morwong fishery and <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> urchin barrens on the inshore reef ecosystem. Profit was found to destabilise the fishery, while a total allowable catch (TAC) had a stabilising impact on the fishery, profit and stock biomass. Rock lobster were predicted to be able to control urchin abundance and limit barren formation. Qualitative predictions were generated from each model to guide and focus further research using quantitative models. A survival experiment focussing on the target and non-target species captured in the banded morwong fishery was undertaken as the third step in the ecosystem analyses. This survival experiment was used to relate fish condition at capture to overall fishery mortality (including retained and discarded individuals) and discard survival rates. <b>The</b> majority <b>of</b> banded morwong (97. 8...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Background: Decision {{aids are}} {{structures}} education packages designed to foster {{shared decision making}} between patient physician. They are often used when there is confusion or disagreement associated with the values patients assigned to, and the evidence on, <b>the</b> various outcomes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intervention in question. Blood transfusion relation to elective surgery {{is an area that}} requires both physicians and patients to carefully consider different treatment options. <b>The</b> issues <b>of</b> variation in transfusion practices, different personal values in regards to receiving blood, and the uncertainty as to whether <b>the</b> benefits <b>of</b> technologies <b>aimed</b> at minimising allogeneic blood use (e. g. pre-operative autologous donation or PAD) outweigh the potential harms justify attempts to design a patient decision aid in this area. Aims: <b>The</b> overall <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis was to develop and pilot test a decision aid describing blood transfusion options to patients planning any type of major elective surgery (such as hip replacement or heart bypass). A series of studies and reviews were necessary to adequately inform <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decision <b>aid.</b> Hence, additional <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis were: to investigate whether the manner in which treatment effects are presented influence the healthcare decisions made by patients (information framing).; To systematically review the evidence on the benefits and harms of PAD (e. g. need for allogeneic/autologous blood, other clinical outcomes).; To examine the attitudes, beliefs, understanding and possible misconceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general public, patients, special interest group members (e. g. Hepatitis C Council), and physicians regarding blood transfusion. Methods: The following studies were undertaken to inform <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decision aid: a systematic review and meta-analysis exploring <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> information framing on patient treatment decision making; a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled observational studies on PAD; and a survey (administered as a computer assisted telephone interview) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> views and opinions of physicians, patients, patients, and the public about blood transfusion. Decision aid development was guided by the Ottawa Decision Support Framework. The initial evaluation stages involved drafting and re-drafting the decision content by a group <b>of</b> experts in <b>the</b> fields <b>of</b> haematology, internal medicine, epidemiology, and health psychology. <b>The</b> final draft <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decision <b>aid</b> was reviewed by health professionals and patients who were about to have or had recently undergone major elective surgery. Participants provided feedback on its acceptability and identified areas for improvement during a semi-structures telephone interview. <b>The</b> decision <b>aid</b> was also quality assessed using the CREDIBLE criteria. Results: <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> a systematic review on information framing indicated that numerical data should be presented in {{more than one way to}} ensure patients form an accurate perception of treatment worth. In general, surgical and medical treatments tended to be preferred when information was expressed in a survival (positive) frame compared to a mortality (negative) frame, or when expressed as relative risk reduction (RRR) as opposed to absolute risk reduction (ARR) or number needed to treat (NNT) frames. <b>The</b> systematic review <b>of</b> controlled observational studies on PAD produced similar results to those from randomised controlled trials: PAD statistically significantly decreased the need for allogeneic blood yet increased <b>the</b> likelihood <b>of</b> receiving any transfusion (allogeneic/autologous) compared to usual care. Most studies (75 %) did not use a transfusion protocol and seven studies reported using a more liberal protocol for <b>the</b> transfusion <b>of</b> autologous blood compared to allogeneic blood. Due to <b>the</b> paucity <b>of</b> research examining other clinical outcomes such as infection and thrombosis, there is insufficient data to determine the impact PAD may have on these outcomes. In surveys with patients, special interest group members and <b>the</b> public, one-third <b>of</b> respondents voiced concern with receiving an allogeneic blood transfusion, and most respondents overestimated <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> contracting HIV and HCV through a blood transfusion when compared to other events of equal risk (e. g. being struck by lightning). Approximately 80 % of respondents preferred PAD due to the perception that it eliminated all risks associated with a blood transfusion, is 100 % compatible, and that it helps others through contributing to the blood supply. Although approximately half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> physicians interviewed used a transfusion trigger or protocol, individual patient characteristics were the main factor driving <b>the</b> decision <b>of</b> whether to transfuse. However, some respondents were critical of those who either did (or did not) use protocols, while others modified <b>the</b> "science <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guidelines" according to <b>the</b> needs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual. <b>The</b> final draft <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decision <b>aid</b> asked patients to consider the point at which they would prefer to receive a blood transfusion after major elective surgery (using haemoglobin values or transfusion "triggers" as a guide) and to decide whether or not to use PAD. <b>The</b> decision <b>aid,</b> "Blood Transfusion Options for Planned Surgery: A Decision Aid for Patients", consisted of a 32 -page A 5 size booklet and 28 -minute audio tape or CD. <b>The</b> decision <b>aid</b> included <b>the</b> following sections: information about blood and blood loss; facts about blood transfusions; blood transfusions an you; your transfusion preference after surgery; approaches to replacing blood less; the differences between volunteer-donated and self-donated blood; adverse effects of blood transfusion; frequently asked questions; steps in decision making; and scientific references. A decision slip was included at <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> booklet for patients to complete and return to their surgeon. Patients felt that <b>the</b> decision <b>aid</b> removed fears and common misconceptions associated with blood transfusion by providing them with more knowledge and realistic expectations of transfusion risks. Importantly, health professionals and patients felt that the information in <b>the</b> decision <b>aid</b> was presented in a balanced way and that it did not coerce patients to choose one particular option over another. Pilot data revealed that although <b>the</b> decision <b>aid</b> was generally well received, a number of revisions will be required before successful implementation. Important changes include; updating all information for recency; providing better explanations of numerical data; reducing <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> information where appropriate; tailoring <b>the</b> decision <b>aid</b> for use in orthapaedic surgery (due to reduced utilisation rates of PAD); and clarifying <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> transfusion triggers in <b>the</b> decision <b>aid,</b> including whether it is appropriate to involved patients in that stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decision making process. <b>The</b> format <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decision <b>aid</b> also needs to be reconsidered (i. e. computer-based or continue with print and audio material) as costs and time restraints were highlighted as potential barriers to its use in practice. Based on the CREDIBLE criteria, <b>the</b> decision <b>aid</b> requires an updating policy, accessible documentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> development process, and formal evaluation using a before-after pilot-study/randomised controlled trial. Conclusion: <b>The</b> task <b>of</b> developing and evaluating a decision aid on blood transfusion was found to be very complex and demanding. For instance, a number of in-depth studies were needed to adequately inform decision <b>aid</b> development and <b>the</b> decision <b>aid</b> still requires formal evaluation. However, the findings from the research undertaken in the thesis also reinforced the need for a decision aid on blood transfusion - the evidence on the benefits and harms of blood transfusion and PAD is controversial, practice variation exists, and personal values influenced patient and physician views of blood transfusion and PAD. Despite receiving positive feedback from health professionals and patients, <b>the</b> decision <b>aid</b> requires some significant modifications. Reduced utilisation rates of PAD indicate that a generic decision aid for procedures other than major orthopaedic surgery may not be relevant in practice. Although the issues surrounding blood transfusion justify the need for a decision <b>aid,</b> <b>the</b> desire for both patients and physicians for limited patient involvement regarding <b>the</b> decision <b>of</b> when to give a blood transfusion (using transfusion triggers as a guide) suggests that <b>the</b> <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decision <b>aid</b> in this area need to be reconsidered. However, as <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> older Australians undergoing major elective surgery rises due to population ageing, <b>the</b> availability <b>of</b> decision <b>aids</b> that adequately inform patients <b>of</b> <b>the</b> benefits and harms of blood transfusion and <b>the</b> option <b>of</b> PAD will be imperative. With further revision and evaluation, this decision aid should fulfill its promise as an effective tool for education patients about blood transfusion...|$|R

40|$|Use of inter-loop aiding for {{improving}} tracking performance {{has been widely}} researched in recent years. However, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previously proposed <b>aiding</b> schemes rely {{on the assumption that}} <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> loop remains unaffected by received interference. This paper argues that this may not always be the case. It is likely that <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> loop may also degrade in the case where interference is received at <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> carrier’s frequency resulting in performance degradation of both aiding and aided loops. This paper proposes an aiding scheme that offers performance improvements in case interference corrupts both frequencies. Also, an algorithm is proposed that continuously updates <b>the</b> <b>aided</b> loop bandwidth to keep its jitter at a minimum. A relationship between <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> signal and its effects on <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aided</b> loop is analysed.
