40|$|ABSTRACT The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} is to establish an intell-igent feeding decision system for aquaculture. The Bidynanus bass is the major material fish of the experiment. Some enviromental factorssuch as water temperature﹐dissolved oxygen, hydrogen ion concentr-ation, <b>atmospheric</b> pressure, and <b>electricity</b> conductance in a water- reuse culture system, located {{in the basement of a}} building, were measured and analyzed to find the characteristic parameters of the sy-stem during the feeding process. The experimental results demonstrated that the value of the dissolved oxygen increased continuously and rapidlyduring the feeding process. The maximum increament of dissolved oxygenwas up to 0. 7 ppm. In the other factors, no obvious changes were observed in the experiment. An alternate approach that determines the feeding decision index using fuzzy theory is suggested in this paper. The change rate of dissolvedoxygen in 80 seconds, and the maximum change of dissolved oxygen in 4 minutes [...] two of the characteristic factors accompanied with the bass''ssearching behaviors [...] are modeled as fuzzy sets to account for their relative contributions. Twenty-five implications are used to infer the decision index by the min. -max. fuzzy reasoning method. The decision indices inferred bythe fuzzy logic approach are helpful to get the correctly experimental results. This is accomplished by using the low threshold of the decision index depending on the appetite of the fish observed from a CCD camera synchronously. The feeding decision made by the fuzzy set approach is close to actual searching behaviors.

Such phenomena appear to me to be incompatible with all that we know of electricity and its modes of discharge. As time is an element in the effect (1418. 1436.) it is possible perhaps that an electric discharge might really pass as a ball from place to place; but as every thing shows that its velocity must be almost infinite, and the time of its duration exceedingly small, it is impossible that the eye should perceive it as anything else than a line of light. That phenomena of balls of fire may appear {{in the atmosphere}}, I do not mean to deny; but that they {{have anything to do with}} the discharge of ordinary electricity, or are at all related to lightning or <b>atmospheric</b> <b>electricity,</b> is much more than doubtful.|$|E

The {{peculiar}} {{characters of}} nitrogen {{in relation to}} the electric discharge (1422. 1458.) must, evidently, have an important influence over the form and even the occurrence of lightning. Being that gas which most readily produces coruscations, and, by them, extends discharge to a greater distance than any other gas tried, it is also that which constitutes four-fifths of our atmosphere; and as, in atmospheric electrical phenomena, one, and sometimes both the inductive forces are resident on the particles of the air, which, though probably affected as to conducting power by the aqueous particles in it, cannot be considered as a good conductor; so the peculiar power possessed by nitrogen, to originate and effect discharge {{in the form of a}} brush or of ramifications, has, probably, an important relation to its electrical service in nature, as it most seriously affects the character and condition of the discharge when made. The whole subject of discharge from and through gases is of great interest, and, if only in reference to <b>atmospheric</b> <b>electricity,</b> deserves extensive and close experimental investigation.|$|E
40|$|Nuclear fission power {{reactors}} {{represent a}} potential solution to {{many aspects of}} global change possibly induced by inputting of either particulate or carbon or sulfur oxides into the Earth`s atmosphere. Of proven technological feasibility, they presently produce high-grade heat for large-scale electricity generation, space heating and industrial process-energizing around the world, without emitting greenhouse gases or <b>atmospheric</b> particulates; importantly, <b>electricity</b> production costs from the best nuclear plants presently are closely comparable {{with those of the}} best fossil-fired plants. However, a substantial number of issues currently stand between nuclear power and widespread substitution for large stationary fossil fuel-fired systems. These include perceptual ones regarding both long-term and acute operational safety, plant decommissioning, fuel reprocessing, radwaste disposal, fissile materials diversion to military purposes and - perhaps most seriously- readily quantifiable concerns regarding long-term fuel supply and total unit electrical energy cost. We sketch a road-map for proceeding from the present situation toward a nuclear power-intensive world, addressing along the way each of the concerns which presently impede widespread nuclear substitution for fossil fuels, particularly for coal in the most populous and rapidly developing portions of the world, e. g., China and India. This `design to societal specifications` approach to large-scale nuclear fission power systems may lead to energy sources meeting essentially all stationary demands for high-temperature heat. Such advanced options offer a human population of ten billion the electricity supply levels currently enjoyed by Americans for 10, 000 years. Nuclear power systems tailored to local needs-and-interests and having a common advanced technology base could reduce present-day world-wide C 0 {sub 2 } emissions by two-fold, if universally employed. By application to small mobile demands, a second two-fold reduction might be attained. Even the first such halving of carbon intensivity of stationary-source energy production world-wide might permit continued slow power-demand growth in the highly developed countries and rapid development of the other 80 % of the world, both without active governmental suppression of fossil fuel usage - while also stabilizing carbon input-rates into the Earth`s atmosphere. The second two-fold reduction might obviate most global warming concerns...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDuring the Cassini-Huygens probe {{mission at}} Titan on 14 th January 2005, The Huygens Atmospheric Structure {{instrument}} (HASI) performed in situ {{measurements of the}} physical and electrical properties of the atmosphere and the surface along the entry and descent trajectory and at the landing site. The atmospheric profile along the Huygens probe trajectory during entry phase was retrieved from the accelerom-eters data, while below 160 km direct pressure and temperature measurements were performed. The atmosphere was detected by HASI at an altitude level of about 1500 km; pressure and temperature vertical profiles were retrieved starting from the exobase (estimated to be at ∼ 1380 km) using the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. The upper atmosphere was warmer than predicted [Yelle et al. 1997]; several temperature variations have been observed in thermosphere possibly related to inversion layers and other dynamical effects such as gravity or tidal waves [Strobel, 2006]. The virtual absence of the mesosphere and the wave-like nature of the temperature profile suggest that the region in Titan's atmosphere above 250 km may not be dominated by radiative processes and may be strongly influenced by wave activity. The stratopause, which was detected near 250 km, had a temperature of ∼ 187 K and a pressure of about 0. 3 hPa. The temperature structure of the lower atmosphere is in very good agreement with the Voyager 1 RSS and IRIS measurements [Lindal et al. 1983, Lellouch et al. 1989]. The tropopause, at the altitude level of ∼ 44 km (at pressure of 115 ± 1 hPa) had a temperature of (70. 43 ± 0. 25) K. The meteorological conditions monitored at the surface of Titan for almost half an hour, resulted in a mean value of temperature of 93. 65 ± 0. 25 K and pressure of 1467 ± 1 hPa. Meterological interpretation of HASI data leaded to {{the determination of the}} presence of a weakly convective Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) of 300 m [Tokano et al. 2006] also confirmed by the correlation with Huygens DWE data. The electrical properties, as the permittivity at 45 Hz and the conductivity, of the atmosphere have been measured during the whole descent phase and at the surface of Titan by the Permittivity, Wave and Altimetry package (PWA) sensors. An ionized layer was detected at altitudes above 50 km, using two independent techniques, and the presence of free electrons in the upper atmosphere was confirmed. The relative dielectric constant of Titan's surface material is nearly 2 and the electric conductivity 4 × 10 − 1 0 S m − 1 [Grard et al. 2006]. The temperature and density profiles inferred by HASI are of great value since they provide: a) an accurate determination of the whole atmosphere (from ground up to exobase); b) the only new and independent definition of the tropospheric thermal structure; c) atmospheric parameters based on very precise characterization of the chemical structure. An overview of the results concerning the <b>atmospheric</b> structure, <b>electricity</b> and meteorology will be presented and discussed in relation with the results of ground based and remote sensing observations by Cassini in this last decade...|$|R
