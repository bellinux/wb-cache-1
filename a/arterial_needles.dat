40|$|Introduction: While {{using the}} Transonic Qc[TM] machine to assess access flow in {{arteriovenous}} fistulae (AVF), we observed that {{when compared to}} antegrade <b>arterial</b> <b>needle</b> insertion, retrograde <b>arterial</b> <b>needle</b> insertion could regularly produce lower access flow measurements. This study sought to explore this phenomenon. Method: 23 patients entered and 20 finished the study. Patient selection criteria included: functioning AVF and an adequate AVF length for either retrograde or antegrade <b>arterial</b> <b>needle</b> insertion. After ensuring stable and similar blood pressures, 3 flow measurements were taken during the first 2 hours on the same dialysis day of 3 consecutive weeks using antegrade needle insertion then were repeated on 3 further consecutive weeks using retrograde insertion. Results: Overall, access flows measured with retrograde insertion were significantly lower by a mean difference of 107. 15 ml/min (57 - 484 ml/min) than the flows measured with antegrade needle placement. In 5 / 20, 3 recorded minimal difference and 2 had a higher access flows during retrograde insertion. No recirculation was observed during either antegrade or retrograde needle insertion. The paired t-test showed that there was {{significant difference between the}} antegrade versus retrograde mean measurements (p = 0. 005). Conclusion: Although the sample size is small and the number of measurements limited, we conclude that access flows may be greater with an antegrade arterial orientation compared to flows recorded with a retrograde orientation. The phenomenon behind this conclusion is yet to be investigated. We suggest that when using the Transonic Qc[TM] access measurement device the <b>arterial</b> <b>needle</b> should always be in the same direction for each measurement for each individual patient. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Background. A good {{test for}} {{monitoring}} blood flow (Qa) must be accurate, rapid and economical {{in order to}} allow frequent easy measurements. The glucose pump test (GPT) is based on a constant glucose infusion as a dilutional indicator of Qa. Methods. GPT protocol requires a constant glucose infusion, by a syringe pump, into the <b>arterial</b> <b>needle</b> and two blood withdrawals from the venous needle, one basal before the infusion (Ca 1), the other (Ca 2) 11 s after the start of the infusion. At the bedside we measure glucose on Ca 1 and Ca 2. Knowing the infused glucose concentration (Ci) and the pump infusion rate (Qi) we can easily calculate QasQi 3 (Ci–Ca 2) u (Ca 2 –Ca 1).

40|$|Hemodialysis access {{recirculation}} {{occurs when}} dialyzed blood returning through the venous needle reenters the extracorporeal circuit through the <b>arterial</b> <b>needle</b> rather than {{returning to the}} systemic circulation. It is important to meausre hemodialysis access recirculation for two reasons: The reentry of dialyzed blood into the extracorporeal circuite reduces solute concentration gradients across the dialysis membrane by mixing already dialyzed with undialyzed blood. As a result, the efficiency of dialysis is reduced. High degrees of recirculation {{can lead to a}} significant discrepancy between the amount of hemodialysis prescribed (prescribed Kt/V urea) and the amount of hemodialysis delivdred (delivered Kt/V urea). High degrees of access recirculation indicate the presence of access stenoses, {{the most common cause of}} access thrombosis. Prospective identification and treamtnet of access stenoses improves long-term access patency rate...|$|R
40|$|The need to {{maintain}} long term vascular access patency is critical for patients with kidney failure. Vascular access allows artificial blood filtration through haemodialysis and failure of the access can be life threatening. The mechanisms for failure are not understood and dialysis needles may be a key contributor. Haemodynamic parameters {{play an important role}} in vascular health and have been linked to the development of intimal hyperplasia, a pathological growth of the blood vessel initiated by injury. The primary objective of this thesis is to examine the haemodynamic forces produced by dialysis needles and to determine methods of identifying and minimising the risk of vascular access failure. Computational fluid dynamic models have been utilised to examine the haemodynamics produced by the needles, in particular the high shear stresses on the vein wall and the oscillatory shear with high particle residency times. These computational simulations were validated using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry measurements on a flow rig. The flow field produced by the <b>arterial</b> <b>needle</b> remained localised around the needle tip indicating that the two needles can be placed in close proximity to each other without increasing the risk of access recirculation. Conversely, the flow field produced by the venous needle was more dynamic due to the presence of the jet. Both needles produced disturbed flows with high residency times which may lead to endothelial dysfunction, whilst the venous needle also produced high shear stresses at the point of jet impingement, which may damage the endothelial layer. Shallow needle angles with optimal placement away from the walls of the vein and the use of blood flow rates around 300 ml/min may minimise potential endothelial damage. Needle rotation, a technique usually performed to alleviate pressure in the arterial line, was shown to have no haemodynamic benefit and can increase the risk of infiltration. A plastic cannula for haemodialysis offers a viable alternative to the current metal needles. Its symmetric geometry with four staggered side holes also negates the requirement of rotation. Pressures were also examined to determine the potential of microbubble formation due to cavitation. Elevated blood flow rates (> 600 ml/min) and sharp changes in geometry were catalysts for cavitation at the <b>arterial</b> <b>needle.</b> Doppler ultrasound measurements revealed a high level of pulsatility within the extracorporeal circuit. This indicated that cavitation at the <b>arterial</b> <b>needle</b> is unlikely to occur under normal dialysis conditions, but may occur at the roller pump. Clinical measurements pertaining to each dialysis session were also analysed to determine the incidence of late fistula failure. Patient data confirmed that stenosis in the venous outflow segment is pertinent in late fistula failure. The risk of stenosis was higher in the first six months of fistula use, as the blood vessels adapt to frequent cannulation. This was reflected by the increase in vascular resistance over the life of the access. The patient data supports the computational results, which indicates that stenosis in the outflow vein may be caused by the haemodynamics produced by dialysis needles...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} in vitro study was to assess a new detection method based on pulse pressure analysis at the hemodialysis needle. A silicon model of a radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula was built in a mock loop. Pressure profiles were measured at the <b>arterial</b> hemodialysis <b>needle</b> and in the proximal feeding artery. Stenoses (50 and 25 % diameter reduction) were created proximal to the anastomosis (proximal artery) and distal to the <b>arterial</b> <b>needle</b> (distal vein and proximal vein). The pulse pressure (PP) at the needle was divided by the PP at the feeding artery to obtain a dimensionless ratio, %PP. Experiments were conducted at different blood flow (500 - 1200 mL/min) and heart rates (60 - 90 beats/min) to test this new index {{over a wide range}} of hemodynamic conditions. In the control model (no stenosis), %PP was 20. 26 +/- 4. 55. A proximal artery 50 % stenosis significantly decreased %PP to 7. 69 +/- 2. 08 (P < 0. 0001), while the presence of 50 % stenosis in the distal (36. 20 +/- 2. 12) and proximal (32. 38 +/- 2. 17) vein led to significantly higher values of %PP (P < 0. 0001). For stenosis of 25 % diameter reduction in the proximal artery, the %PP decreased to 15. 45 +/- 2. 13 (P = 0. 0022) and the %PP increased with a 25 % stenosis in the distal vein to 26. 71 +/- 3. 01 (P = 0. 0003) and in the proximal vein to 26. 53 +/- 2. 67 (P = 0. 0004).

40|$|Hemodialysis {{treatment}} {{requires a}} patient’s blood circulation {{to be connected}} to artificial kidney extracorporeal (EC) circulation through a vascular access. In chronic patients, the vascular access is normally created by an artero-venous (AVF) fistula, where part of the peripheral arterial blood flows along a venous vessel. The connection is made by inserting two needles into the venous vessel. Blood is drawn to the EC along the <b>arterial</b> <b>needle</b> and is returned to the patient along the venous needle. In this study, we simulated the hemodynamics of vascular access with particular focus on the region downstream to the venous needle in order to analyze the influence of return flow (Qb) on blood circulation. A three dimensional CFD model of vascular access circulation was developed and various blood flow conditions were simulated. Simulation results predicted a critical circulation downstream to the needle tip due to the confluence between the return flow and the access flow. A vortex recirculation was evident in this region. Vortex extension appeared only for Qb values higher than 40 % of the access flow and was limited to a zone few centimetres from the needle tip in the downstream direction. CFD simulations allowed a detailed study of the complex hemodynamics in the vascular access region surrounding the inserted needle which would otherwise be difficult to measure experimentally...|$|R
40|$|Hemodialysis patient {{survival}} {{is dependent on}} the availability of a reliable vascular access. In clinical practice, procedures for vascular access cannulation vary from clinic to clinic. We investigated the impact of cannulation technique on arteriovenous fistula and graft survival. Based on an April 2009 cross-sectional survey of vascular access cannulation practices in 171 dialysis units, a cohort of patients with corresponding vascular access survival information was selected for follow-up ending March 2012. Of the 10, 807 patients enrolled in the original survey, access survival data were available for 7058 patients from nine countries. Of these, 90. 6 % had an arteriovenous fistula and 9. 4 % arteriovenous graft. Access needling was by area technique for 65. 8 %, rope-ladder for 28. 2 %, and buttonhole for 6 %. The most common direction of puncture was antegrade with bevel up (43. 1 %). A Cox regression model was applied, adjusted for within-country effects, and defining as events the need for creation of a new vascular access. Area cannulation was associated with a significantly higher risk of access failure than rope-ladder or buttonhole. Retrograde direction of the <b>arterial</b> <b>needle</b> with bevel down was also associated with an increased failure risk. Patient application of pressure during cannulation appeared more favorable for vascular access longevity than not applying pressure or using a tourniquet. The higher risk of failure associated with venous pressures under 100 or over 150 mmHg should open a discussion on limits currently considered acceptable...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{modification}} in {{technique is}} useful for successful right-sided internal jugular vein (IJV) cannulation {{on the same side}} even after intra-arterial puncture without using ultrasound guidance in adult patients. Materials and Methods: This study was carried out in total 160 adult patient from American Society of Anesthesiologists Grade II to III patients male (n = 95) and female (n = 65) who underwent cardiac surgery where cannulation was done on right sided by triple lumen catheter (7 French) using Seldinger technique. Results: Majority of patients were cannulated successfully by Seldinger technique with single or double attempt except for five patients in which arterial puncture occurred. All five patients were cannulated successfully on the same side with this modified technique without any significant major complications. They were managed by application of blocker at the end of <b>arterial</b> <b>needle</b> puncture without removing it. In our routine practice, we were used to removing this needle and applying compression for few minutes to prevent hematoma formation after an arterial puncture. In this study, cannula was used as a marker or guideline for the relocation of IJV on the same side and recannulation was performed by changing the direction of needle on same side lateral to the previous one and without going towards the same direction to prevent the arterial puncture again. Conclusion: Most simple and useful modified technique for institutes where the complications are most common with trainee doctors and in hospitals where there is no advanced facility like ultrasound-guided cannulation available. By this modification, it will be time saving, very comfortable, and user-friendly technique with high success rate...|$|R

This study investigates the hemostatic efficacy of a new hemostatic pad with advanced sealing properties using protein-reactive polyethylene glycol-coated collagen (PCC, Hemopatch) versus an oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC, Tabotamp/Surgicel Original) in a leporine arterial bleeding model of vascular reconstruction and a porcine hepatic model of general surgery. Methods: In both models, paired lesions were created and treated according to a randomized scheme and evaluated up to 10  min after application (40 lesions/group/model). <b>Arterial</b> <b>needle</b> holes were created in the femoral arteries of anesthetized rabbits and hepatic lesions were created into hepatic parenchyma of anesthetized pigs. Both models were heparinized to mimic clinical comorbidity. Results: In the leporine vascular surgical model, PCC provided superior hemostatic success compared to ORC at 2  min (Odds Ratio of Success: 85, 95 % CI: 25. 8 – 282) and similar hemostatic success at 10  min. In the porcine hepatic model, PCC provided superior hemostatic success compared to ORC at 2 (98 vs 55 %, P <  0. 001), 3 (93 vs 65 %, P <  0. 001), 4 (98 vs 68 %, P <  0. 001) and 5  min (95 vs 80 %, P <  0. 001), but similar hemostatic success at 8 and 10  min.

By measuring ar-terio-internal jugular differences of oxygen and glucose, the relation between changes in cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolism can be ob-served. The purpose of this report is to record our findings {{in the use of}} the nitrous oxide tech-nique in 33 observations on 20 normal young men; in the comparison of certain cerebral metabolic functions on 14 normal young men in the supine and erect postures; and in observations on the effects of apprehension on the cerebral circulation. METHOD Seventeen of the 20 subjects were normal, male medi-cal students; the other three (W. Mc., D. M., and R. H. in Table I) were hospital patients who showed no evi-dence of disease. All the subjects were studied in the fasting state. Following local procainization, a 19 gauge, 6. 5 cm. needle was inserted into the right internal jugular bulb in the manner described by Myerson (3), and an <b>arterial</b> <b>needle</b> was inserted in the right femoral artery. Following this the patient was allowed to lie quietly for 40 to 50 minutes before the procedure was continued. The essential nature of the experiments ascribed in all theoretical details to the nitrous oxide method described by Kety and Schmidt (1, 2), but the mean arterio-venous nitrous oxide difference for the 10 minute period was measured differently. Instead of drawing five separate, simultaneous samples from the artery and vein for the plotting of the nitrous oxide curves, simultaneous con-tinuous samples (called integrated samples) were drawn from the artery and vein into heparinized, oiled syringes 'This work was supported by a grant from the Anna M.

40|$|The {{use of a}} semidosed system (the Magill attachment) for {{positive}} pressure breathing was investigated. Various patterns of ventilation were used and their effects assessed by serial measurement of the arterial carbon dioxide. It was found {{that this could be}} kept within limits comparable to those found during normal sleep using a flow of fresh gases as low as 5 l. /min. This result was most easily achieved if the tidal volume were large (more than 1 1. for the average adult). Other incidental findings are discussed and it is conduded that semidosed systems provide a safe and economical method for maintaining ventilation when special equipment is not available. The use of semidosed anaesthetic systems for intermittent positive pressure ventilation (LPPV) was investigated by Waters and Mapleson (1961) who concluded that the Magill attachment was the least efficient of the systems they examined. Sykes (1959) had also investigated the Magill attachment for IPPV and had concluded that impracticably high flows of fresh gases were re-quired and also very large minute volumes if carbon dioxide retention were to be prevented. Parkhouse (1963) and Hunter (1963) condemned its use for IPPV for these reasons. These views seemed at variance with those of many anaes-thetists who believe that they regularly and easily produce hypocapnic apnoea performing IPPV with this apparatus. It was decided to reassess the use of the Magill attachment for LPPV. METHOD The subjects were twenty patients undergoing carotid angiography during the investigation of neurological disease. None had cardiovascular or pulmonary disease that was likdy to interfere with ventilatory function. All were given general anaes-thetics and intubated.

GPT protocol requires a constant glucose infusion, by a syringe pump, into the <b>arterial</b> <b>needle</b> and two blood withdrawals from the venous needle, one basal before the infusion (C(a 1)), the other (C(a 2)) 11 s after the start of the infusion. At the bedside we measure glucose on C(a 1) and C(a 2). Knowing the infused glucose concentration (C(i)) and the pump infusion rate (Q(i)) we can easily calculate Q(a) =Q(i) x(C(i) -C(a 2)) /(C(a 2) -C(a 1)). We verified the accuracy of this new method by comparing it with the in vitro results from a circuit reproducing vascular access circulation, and in vivo comparing GPT-Q(a) with Doppler ultrasound in pre-dialysis to the Transonic HD 01 -Q(a) during dialysis in 23 chronic haemodialysis patients. GPT-Q(a) values were highly correlated with the in vitro Q(a) = 1. 01 x GPT-Q(a) - 16. 6; r= 0. 94. There was agreement between the mean flow values of GPT and Doppler (927. 5 and 927. 1 ml/min, respectively; P=NS) while the mean value of HD 01 was significantly lower (HD 01 -Q(a) = 690 ml/min; P< 0. 001 vs GPT-Q(a) and Doppler-Q(a)). The regression analysis showed a good correlation between GPT and Transonic results (r= 0. 95; HD 01 -Q(a) = 0. 86 x GPT-Q(a) - 111. 9), while {{there was a significant difference}} between the two measurements (mean Delta 235 +/- 117 ml/min; range from 15 to 451 ml/min). This difference could be caused by the large haemodynamic variations (different blood pressure, cardiac output, circulating effective volume, haematocrit) between pre-dialysis and intra-dialysis and in addition by the counter current flow during the reversal blood lines Transonic measurements. GPT offers the advantage of a simple bedside procedure easily performed before dialysis: it does not interfere with the dialysis treatment and it is less intrusive for the patient as it does not involve reversal of the blood lines.

40|$|Abstract — Emboli or Air bubble {{detection}} {{is vital}} for many medical procedures involving Extracorporeal Blood Circuits or ECBC e. g. hemodialysis, hemofiltration and cardiopulmonary bypass. This risk has increased as negative pressures are developed between the <b>arterial</b> fistula <b>needle</b> and the blood pump in the ECBC machine. This study suggests a capacitor device to detect the presence of air bubbles by measuring change in the output voltage. The capacitor has two platinum plates with area 0. 75 cm 2. The distance between the plates is 1 cm and Dextran 70 fluid is introduced as the dielectric material between the plates. This solution replaces blood to avoid clotting whilst conducting the experiment. This device is connected with a resistor i. e. 100 kΩ to form a low pass filter circuit.

40|$|Introduction: This {{case report}} intends to {{highlight}} the Haemodialysis Reliable Outflow (HeRO) graft as a potential long term option for ongoing dialysis in patients with central venous stenosis. Presentation of case: A 55  year old patient, who developed end stage renal failure (ESRF) after chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer, presented at the limit of her dialysis access after a 15  year haemodialysis history causing central vein stenosis. The patient was initially started on peritoneal dialysis but after repeated peritonitis was switched to haemodialysis. Over fifteen years of haemodialysis the patient had fistulae created in all four limbs. She had multiple tunnelled neck lines and developed an occluded left brachiocephalic vein and stenosed superior vena cava. Catheter dialysis via the right internal jugular vein was attempted but proved increasingly problematic due to poor clearances and frequent catheter changes. A further {{attempt was made to}} treat with peritoneal dialysis, but again, this was unsuccessful. As the patient had two failed attempts at peritoneal dialysis, had exhausted all her peripheral access options, and was having problematic catheter dialysis, she was offered the option of the HeRO graft as a ‘last resort’. Discussion: The HeRO graft is a fully subcutaneous vascular access system that bypasses the central venous system providing haemodialysis access for patients with central venous stenosis. It consists of an arterial graft component and a venous outflow component, which are connected via a titanium connector. The central vein stenosis/occlusion is stented with insertion of the graft in to the right atrium, which is then secured to the <b>arterial</b> component for <b>needling.</b> So that successful dialysis could be completed as soon as possible post-operatively, the HeRO graft, in this instance, was combined with an immediate needling graft (Acuseal). This allowed the patient to receive successful dialysis within hours of completing the procedure. Conclusion: This patient had reached the end of her haemodialysis life with no other options available. She was treated successfully with the HeRO graft, which at two months was patent and problem free. The patient had been able to return to work {{for the first time in}} 15 months. Utilising the HeRO graft in this way may provide new, potentially long term, options for safe and effective dialysis in patients with central venous stenosis...|$|R
