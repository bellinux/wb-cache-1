40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Process Engineering)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. A full scale, three dimensional, transient, {{mathematical}} model {{was developed to}} simulate fluid flow and mixing in gas stirred ladles. The volume of fluid (VOF) and discrete phase (DPM) models were used in combination to account for multiphase aspects, and a slightly {{modified version of the}} standard - model was employed for turbulence modelling. The model was validated to compare well against published physical modelling results. Model results were interpreted from the fundamental grounds of kinetic energy transport within the ladle. This approach led to the specification of three key measures of mixing efficiency: The rate and efficiency of kinetic energy transfer from the buoyant gas to the bulk steel as well as the total kinetic energy holding capacity of the ladle. These measures describe the quantity of mixing in any specific ladle setup, whereas the traditional measure of mixing time reflects mixing quality, i. e. the degree of kinetic energy distribution through the entire ladle. The model was implemented in designed experiments to assess various operating and design variables pertaining to mixing quantity and quality. Considerable time was invested in finding the correct balance between numerical accuracy and computational time so that the model could be used to generate the required data within the given time frame. Experiments on the operating variables drew an important distinction between factors influencing the shape and the strength of gas induced flow patterns. Flow pattern strengthening variables, such as gas purge rate, significantly affected the quantity of mixing, but had a limited effect on mixing quality. Variables such as mass loading that influence the shape of the flow patterns had much larger potential to influence both {{the quantity and quality of}} mixing. Minimization of turbulence losses in the region of the plume eye was identified as the primary outcome of ladle design. It was shown that a taller vessel allowed more distance over which the plume could disperse, thereby reducing velocity gradients and subsequent turbulence generation at the free surface. Multiple tuyere systems yielded similar improvements by dividing the gas flow into several weakened plumes. Surface wave formation was investigated as an added mixing mechanism and demonstrated to be impractical for <b>application</b> <b>in</b> <b>full</b> scale gas stirred ladles. The conditions for resonance between the surface wave and the bubble plume were met only in vessels with a very low aspect ratio. Performance improvements offered by swirl in these ladles could easily be replicated in more practical ways. This study demonstrated the potential of {{mathematical model}}ling as a tool for in-depth investigation into fluid flow and mixing in the hostile environment of a full scale gas stirred ladle. Scaled-down cold models are the only alternative and can offer no more than a reasonably reliable predictive framework. The ease of flow data extraction from the numerical model also proved invaluable in facilitating a fundamental understanding of the effects of various important independent variables on ladle hydrodynamics. At this stage of development, however, the model is recommended for use on a comparative basis only. Two important developments are required for complete quantitative agreement: The inclusion of turbulence modulation by the bubbles and the increased turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate in the vicinity of the free surface. A general strategy was developed to account for these effects and it compared favourably with published cold model results. Further research is required to generalize this approach for <b>application</b> <b>in</b> <b>full</b> scale gas stirred ladles...|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of a new technique for metrology of thin liquid films to give both {{the profile of the}} exterior surface and information on the thickness of the film is the main focus of this research. The proposed approach is based on the use of fringe projection system with a narrow band laser illumination and a high concentration of fluorescent dye dissolved in the fluid in order to generate fluorescence emission from minimum thickness of the film (i. e. the top few microns). The method relies on calculation of an interference phase term and the modulation depth of the fringes created by means of a twin fibre configuration. The characterisation of candidate fluorescent dyes in terms of absorption, related to the depth of penetration of the incident light into the dye and their fluorescence emission efficiency is presented and their <b>application</b> <b>in</b> <b>full</b> field imaging experiments is evaluated. A strong focus of the technique proposed is its flexibility and versatility allowing its extension to phase stepping techniques applied to determine the (fringe) phase map from static and dynamic fluids.

On the basis of the phase-height relationship achieved during the calibration process, the proposed measurement system is applied for the shape measurement of some static fluids. The profile of the exterior surface of these fluids is investigated by means of phasestepping technique and the resolution of the measurements is estimated.

40|$|Li-ion {{batteries}} {{have become}} the more dominant battery type used in portable electronic devices such as cell phones, computers and more recently their <b>application</b> <b>in</b> <b>full</b> electric vehicles (EV). Li-ion batteries have many advantages over the traditional rechargeable systems (Pb-acid and Ni-MH) such as their higher energy density, low self-discharge, long capacity cycle life and relatively maintenance free. Due to their commercial advantages, {{a lot of research}} is done in developing new novel Li-ion electrode materials, improving existing ones and to reduce manufacturing costs in order to make them more cost effective in their applications. This study looked at the cathode material chemistry that has a typical spinel manganese oxide (LiMn 2 O 4) type structure. For comparison the study also considered the influence of doping the phase with various metals such as Al, Mg, Co and Ni that were made as precursors using various carboxylic acids (Citric, Ascorbic, Succinic and Poly-acrylic acid) from a sol-gel process. Traditional batch methods of synthesizing the electrode material is costly and do not necessarily provide optimized electrochemical performance. Alternative continuous less energy intensive methods would help reduce the costs of the preparation of the electrode materials. This study investigated the influence of two synthesis techniques on the materials physical and electrochemical characteristics. These synthesis methods included the use of a typical batch sol-gel method and the continuous spray-drying technique. The spinel materials were prepared and characterized by Powder X-Ray Diffraction (PXRD) to confirm the formation of various phases during the synthesis process. In addition, in-situ PXRD techniques were used to track the phase changes that occurred in the typical batch synthesis process from a sol-gel mixture to the final crystalline spinel oxide. The materials were also characterized by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), whereby the materials decomposition mechanisms were observed as the precursor was gradually heated to the final oxide. These synthesized materials prepared under various conditions were then used to build suitable Li-ion coin type of cells, whereby their electrochemical properties were tested by simple capacity tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). EIS measurements were done on the built cells with the various materials at various charge voltages. TG analysis showed that the materials underwent multiple decomposition steps upon heating for the doped lithium manganese oxides, whereas the undoped oxide showed only a single decomposition step. The results showed that all the materials achieved their weight loss below 400 °C, and that the final spinel oxide had already formed. The in-situ PXRD analysis showed the progression of the phase transitions where certain of the materials changed from a crystalline precursor to an amorphous intermediate phase and then finally to the spinel cathode oxide (Li 1. 03 Mg 0. 2 Mn 1. 77 O 4, and LiCo 1. 09 Mn 0. 91 O 4). For other materials, the precursor would start as an amorphous phase, and then upon heating, convert into an impure intermediate phase (Mn 2 O 3) before forming the final spinel oxide (Li 1. 03 Mn 1. 97 O 4 and LiNi 0. 5 Mn 1. 5 O 4). The in-situ study also showed the increases in the materials respective lattice parameters of the crystalline unit cells upon heating and the significant increases in their crystallite sizes when heated above 600 °C. Hence the results implied that a type of sintering of the particles would occur at temperatures above 600 °C, thereby increasing the respective crystallite size. The study showed that the cathode active materials made by the sol-gel spray-drying method would give a material that had a significantly larger surface area and a smaller crystallite size when compared to the materials made by the batch process. The electrochemical analysis showed that there was only a slight increase in the discharge capacities of the cells made with the spray-drying technique when compared to the cells made with the materials from the batch sol-gel technique. Whereas, the EIS study showed that there were distinct differences in the charging behavior of the cells made with the various materials using different synthesis techniques. The EIS results showed that there was a general decrease in the cells charge transfer resistance (Rct) as the charge potential increased regardless of the synthesis method used for the various materials. The results also showed that the lithium-ion diffusion coefficient (DLi) obtained from EIS measurements were in most of the samples higher for the cathode materials that had a larger surface area. This implied that the Li-ion could diffuse at a faster rate through the bulk material. The study concluded that by optimizing the synthesis process in terms of the careful control of the thermal parameters, the Li-ion batteries‟ cathode active material of the manganese spinel type could be optimized and be manufactured by using a continuous flow micro spray process...|$|E
40|$|Global energy {{consumption}} {{is projected to}} increase the world over from 546 EJ in 2010 to an estimated 879 EJ in 2050 (Frei et al., 2013). Several factors contribute to this projected increase including growing global population, {{better quality of life}} globally, and continued electrification of services and products. Three serious issues arise from the increase in consumption and production, that is, fuel supply, and availability and increased anthropogenic emissions. To meet demand, developing countries, such as Pakistan, are investing in power generation research and technologies. Whilst a number of technologies are available, fluidised bed combustion (FBC) is an attractive technological option because of its ability to handle fuels with variable calorific content, moisture content, mineral content and high alkaline content. FBC offers reliable thermal output because of the large thermal mass (fluidised bed) associated with the method. This thesis set out to explore the possibility of using low grade fuels in FBC and investigate the impact the fuels have on agglomerate formation rates and combustion efficiencies. To explore the potential of FBC in the first experimental investigation presented in this thesis, a 350 KW pilot scale FBC rig was used to perform a series of combustion experiments on ten Pakistani coal blends from the Northern Punjab salt rage coal seams. The coals had high sulphur and alkaline content and presented challenges in both combustion and emissions control. Operational variables including bed temperature, bed additives (limestone), sulphur: calcium fuel ratio, additive particle size and co-firing with wood biomass were employed to evaluate the effect of fuel blending, combustion and emissions optimisation. This thesis argues high SO 2 emissions resulting from the combustion of high sulphur coals can be reduced in emission concentration when optimising operational variables. The high alkaline content, because of pyrite (FeS) concentrations in the fuel caused bed agglomeration and slagging in the beds. The investigation analyses the agglomerates and defines the mechanisms involved. This research allows for remedies and implementation choices when considering the coals <b>application</b> <b>in</b> <b>full</b> scale systems. It is not only coal which can be utilised. Further work investigated the effects of five different biomass fuels in FBC. Biomass can be classified as a CO 2 neutral fuel as the CO 2 released during combustion is relatively equal to the CO 2 absorbed in the growth of the original plant. However, biomass is known to contain high concentrations of alkaline species such as potassium (K) and sodium (Na) which were shown in the literature to cause agglomeration. The biomasses were combusted in the FBC rig to evaluate the combustion, emissions, agglomerates, temperatures and pressure outputs associated with each fuel. Following tests the air distribution plate was modified to simulate both a uniform air distribution system and a non-uniform air distribution system. This allowed for comparisons of the fuels in a system with uniform air flows and non-uniform airflows/distribution which would be experienced in damaged systems. Thus, this thesis argues biomass is significant and relevant to industrial application and allowed for identification of significant chemical components in the agglomeration mechanisms of each fuel as well as establishing the performance of each fuel in variable systems. In order to understand the fundamental chemical and physiological makeup of the low-grade fuels it was necessary to conduct an extensive series of fuel characterisation. The fuel characterisation research undertaken yielded information as to the fuels energy content, chemical makeup, combustion characteristic and identify key components such as alkaline species associated with the negative mechanisms seen in pilot scale testing. In order to analyse the fuels x-ray fluorescence (XRF) was used. This technique identifies major and minor oxides in coal samples. However, as demonstrated in the fuel characterisation work, there were limitations, inaccuracies and repeatability issues when analysing low grade fuels with XRF. Thus, a significant effort was made to improve the sampling, ashing, XRF medium and normalisation process. The results of this research led to a more reliable XRF method for analysing low grade fuels and their bi-product of combustion which is applicable for any industry utilising these types of fuels and techniques. The final part of the investigations focused on the prediction of agglomeration and slagging tendencies of the fuels. This was done by applying the results seen in the pilot scale tests and the results of the fuel characterisation work with slagging indices and the application of a thermodynamic model (FACTSAGE). FACTSAGE can be used to predict slagging tendencies of the fuels by modelling chemical species released over temperature ranges. The results showed correlation between the theoretical results and the experimental results Together this research demonstrates the implications of using low-grade fuels in small scale FBC. This thesis explores how this research can then be used in full scale FBC operations. This thesis not only highlights the problems with using low grade fuels in FBC but suggests remedies and potential solutions to the problems based on the results from experimental data and FACTSAGE modelling. It also presents suggestions on how to continue development of the technology to reduce or avoid some of the difficulties in combusting low grade fuels...|$|E
40|$|There {{are several}} ways to improve biogas {{production}} in anaerobic digestion processes and a number of strategies may be chosen. Increased organic loading in existing plants will in most cases demand the introduction of new substrate types. However, to substantially increase the Swedish biogas production new, large-scale biogas plants digesting new substrate types need to be established. Better utilization of existing digester volumes can be linked to:  Increase of organic loading rates and/or reduced hydraulic retention time Optimizing the anaerobic microbial degradation by identifying rate-limitations, its causes and possible remedies such as: Nutrient and trace element balances Needs and availability of trace element Process design aiming at an increase of the active biomass (e. g. recirculation of reactor material, two stage processes) Process inhibition (enzymatically regulated product inhibition and toxicity) Improved pre-treatment to increase degradation rates and VS-reduction Mixing and rheology Better monitoring and control Co-digestion with more high-potential substrates The present report reviews a number of fields that are linked to improvements in the biogas production process as based on the bullets above. A well-working, active biomass is a prerequisite for efficient biogas production processes, why factors affecting microbial growth are crucial to obtain stable processes at the highest possible organic load/lowest possible hydraulic retention time. The microorganisms need nutrients, i. e. carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, magnesium and iron as well as trace elements such as cobalt, nickel, manganese, molybdenum, selenium and tungsten for growth. The need of nutrients and trace elements varies with the substrate digested, the organic loading rate, the process design (e. g. the reactor configuration, the degree of recirculation etc). In addition, the complexity of the chemical reactions controlling the bioavailability of the trace metals is wide, why optimal addition strategies for trace elements needs to be developed. Substrates as food wastes, sewage sludge, cattle manure, certain energy crops and algae are good bases to obtain processes with good nutrient- and trace element balances. These kinds of substrates can often be implemented for “mono-substrate” digestion, while substrates dominated by carbohydrates or fats needs to be co-digested or digested in processes modified by  e. g. nutrient- and trace element additions, sludge recirculation, etc. Protein-rich substrates often include enough nutrients, but can give other process problems (see below). Iron, cobalt and nickel are the nutrients/trace elements given most attention so far. However, molybdenum, selenium and tungsten have also, among others, been shown effective in different AD applications. The effects have, however, mainly been shown on turnover of VFAs and hydrogen (resulting in increased methane formation), while just a few studies have addressed their direct effect on rates of hydrolysis, protein-, fat- and carbohydrate degradation. Selenium- and cobalt-containing enzymes are known to be involved in amino acid degradation, while selenium and tungsten are needed in fat- and long chain fatty acid degradation. Enzymes active in hydrolysis of cellulose {{have been shown to be}} positively affected by cobalt, cupper, manganese, magnesium and calcium. This implies that trace element levels and availability will directly affect the hydrolysis rates as well as rates and degradation pathways for digestion of amino acids, long chain fatty acids and carbohydrates. However, their effect on hydrolysis seems neglected, why studies are needed to map the metals present in active sites and co-factors of enzymes mediating these primary reactions in AD. Further investigations are then needed to elucidate the importance of the identified metals on the different degradation steps of AD aiming at increased degradation rates of polymeric and complex substrates. It should also be noted that the degradation routes for amino acid degradation in AD-processes, factors governing their metabolic pathways, and how ATP is gained in the different pathways seem unknown. The different routes may result in different degradation efficiencies, why a deeper knowledge within this field is called for. Trace metals added to biogas reactors have positive effects on the process only if they are present in chemical species suitable for microbial uptake. Interaction of biogenic sulfide with trace metals has been identified as the main regulator of trace metal speciation during AD. Fe, Co and Ni instantaneously form strong sulfide precipitates in biogas reactors but at the same time show very different chemical speciation features. The soluble fraction of Co widely exceeded the levels theoretically possible in equilibrium with inorganic sulfide. The high level of soluble Co is likely due to association with dissolved organic compounds of microbial origin. Fe and Ni speciation demonstrated a different pattern dominated by low solubility products of inorganic metal sulfide minerals, where their solubility was controlled mainly by the interactions with different dissolved sulfide and organic ligands. To our knowledge, the information about chemical speciation of other trace metals (Se, Mo, and W among others) and its effects on the bioavailability in anaerobic digestion environments is rare. Providing information on the metal requirements by processes linked to their bioavailability in biogas reactors is identified as a key knowledge needed for maximizing the effect of metals added to biogas reactors. Further research is also needed for development and design of proper metal additive solutions for <b>application</b> <b>in</b> <b>full</b> scale biogas plants. A practical approach is to supplement trace metals in specific chemical forms, which are either suitable for direct bio-uptake or will hamper undesirable and bio-uptake-limiting reactions (e. g. mineral precipitation). Recirculation of reactor material as a way to enrich and maintain an active microbial biomass (and, thus, an increase in the substrate turnover rate) in tank reactors has been tested for digestion of fat within BRCs project DP 6. The methane yield increased from 70 to 90 % of the theoretical potential at a fat-loading rate of 1. 5 g VS/L and day. The same strategy has been successful during digestion of fiber sludge from the pulp and paper industry, i. e. the recirculation has been crucial in establishment of low hydraulic retention times. Also degradation of sewage sludge (SS) would likely be improved by recirculation as the retention time of the solid SS is prolonged in such a system. However, this remains to be tested. The recirculation concept also needs to be evaluated in larger scale reactors to form a base to include extra costs and energy consumption vs. the benefits from increased yields. To divide the anaerobic digestion process into two phases, where the hydrolytic/acidogenic and the syntrophic/methanogenic stages of anaerobic digestion are separated, might be a way to enhance degradation of lignocellulosic materials as the hydrolysis of these compounds may be inhibited by the release of soluble sugars. It should be noted that the natural AD of ruminates is phase-separated and improvements in AD can likely be achieved using these natural systems as a starting point. Also the degradation of aromatic and chlorinated species is likely enhanced by phase separation. One way to obtain such systems is to combine a leached bed for hydrolysis of insoluble material with a methanogenic reactor treating the leachate. Plug flow reactors might be another possibility as well as membrane reactors, which physically separates the hydrolyzing and methanogenic phases. Inhibition caused by toxic levels of ammonia (protein- and ammonia rich substrates), fat-rich substrates and long chain fatty acids (LCFAs), aromatic compounds, salts etc. have been reported in many cases and some remedies are suggested. Ammonia can be stripped off as a measure to overcome too high levels. Another option is to adjust pH of the reactor liquid by addition of acid shifting the ammonia-ammonium balance in the system towards less free ammonia. A decrease in alkalinity by acid addition might also affect the availability of trace elements as solubility of trace metal mineral phases is generally higher at lower pH. LCFA degradation has been shown to benefit from periodic additions of fat and is, thus, an effective strategy to minimize inhibition by the release of the LCFA. Adsorption to zeolites has also been shown to abate the inhibition by LCFA. The best way to avoid inhibition is, however, to keep the processes nutritionally well balanced and using concepts suitable for the actual substrate mix digested (i. e. sludge recirculation, phase separation etc.) in order to obtain the highest possible degradation rate for problematic compounds, thus, avoiding accumulation of inhibitory components such as LCFA and aromatics. High ammonia and salt levels can often be regulated by the substrate mix. The hydrolysis is often reported as rate limiting in digestion of complex polymers in balanced anaerobic digestion systems, while the methanogensis is regarded as rate-limiting for more easily degraded substrates. As mentioned above the effect on methane formation rates by the addition of trace elements have been shown in numerous studies, while their effect on the hydrolysis and acidogenic AD steps are much less studied. Thus, the effects of the trace elements on the early steps in the AD-chain need to be investigated further. To obtain high-rate hydrolysis, effective and energy efficient pre-treatment methods are crucial for a large number of substrates. The rate of hydrolysis is to a large extent dependent on the properties of the organic compounds in the substrate e. g. carbohydrates, proteins, fat or lignocellulosic material as well as particle size and pre-treatment methods applied. The establishment and colonization by sessile microorganisms and biofilms is highly important for efficient and high rate hydrolysis. Microbial formation of organic compounds and the availability of surfaces are factors influencing these key processes, which in turn are tightly coupled to the growth conditions for the hydrolyzing microorganisms. This is an area recently brought up as an issue for detailed research. Mixing is mostly needed for effective high-rate biogas production, but too extensive mixing can destroy the syntrohpic interactions necessarily taking place during AD. However, the efficiency of the mixing system design in relation to colonization, presences of dead zones, changes in viscosity/rheology, etc. seem unclear and this area thus calls for further attention.   In high-loaded efficient processes a monitoring program following parameters e. g. organic loading rate, gas-production, VS-reduction, pH and VFA-levels is needed. This can be achieved through sampling and analysis off line, but there are of course benefits with on-line monitoring. A number of different methods have been suggested and tested, and some titration- and spectroscopic methods are applied, but none seems commonly in use. The reasons for the low interest to apply these methods may be the need for expertise on calibration, validation and multivariate analysis of most on-line methods, high maintenance demands (cost and time), and l functional problems related to fouling, gas bubbles, sensor location, disturbing particles etc. New substrates with the highest potential for use in existing or new biogas plants seem to be forestry-based biomass, certain energy crops and macro-algae. Both the energy crops and the macro-algae can be chosen to give nutritionally well balanced AD-processes, while AD on forestry biomass demands nutrient supplements. For both the energy crops and the macro-algae sustainable cultivation systems need to be developed. Crop rotation systems should be employed to minimize tillage as well as fertilization- and pesticide utilization at highest possible TS-yields. System analyses aiming at sustainability and economy of TS and methane yields per ha including needs of nutrient supplements should therefore be performed. In all three cases (forestry biomass, energy crops and algae) pre-treatment methods to create high internal surface areas are needed. However, the pre-treatment methods chosen need to be highly energy- and resource efficient to obtain sustainable systems (a positive energy balance). New plants will for profitability likely need to be large with highly developed infrastructure for substrates supply and distribution of the produced biogas/electricity nearby. Process concepts aiming at highest possible loading rates at shortest possible retention time will be needed, which likely are met by including both phase-separated process systems and systems for sludge recirculation. It should also be noted that the lignin in substrates from forestry biomass needs to be used for production of e. g. polymeric materials or as a fuel to obtain reasonable energy balances for AD of lignocellulose. Pre-treatment methods obtaining separation of lignin is therefore needed. A substantial research and development is in progress within this field. The possibilities for AD within the pulp and paper industry are interesting, especially if specific effluents within the pulp- and paper production units are selected and the raw material for the pulp and paper production is chosen considering the biogas yields of the residues...|$|E
