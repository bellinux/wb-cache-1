5|$|Many plants, {{including}} {{a variety of}} food plants, synthesize dopamine to varying degrees. The highest concentrations have been observed in bananasâ€”the fruit pulp of red and yellow bananas contains dopamine <b>at</b> <b>levels</b> of 40 to 50 parts per million by weight. Potatoes, avocados, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts may also contain dopamine <b>at</b> <b>levels</b> of 1 part per million or more; oranges, tomatoes, spinach, beans, and other plants contain measurable concentrations less than 1 part per million. The dopamine in plants is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine, by biochemical mechanisms {{similar to those that}} animals use. It can be metabolized in a variety of ways, producing melanin and a variety of alkaloids as byproducts. The functions of plant catecholamines have not been clearly established, but there is evidence that they {{play a role in the}} response to stressors such as bacterial infection, act as growth-promoting factors in some situations, and modify the way that sugars are metabolized. The receptors that mediate these actions have not yet been identified, nor have the intracellular mechanisms that they activate.|$|E
