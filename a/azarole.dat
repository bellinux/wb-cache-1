60|$|Many of {{our most}} {{valuable}} fruits, although consisting in a homological sense of widely different organs, are either quite sterile, or produce extremely few seeds. This is notoriously the case with our best pears, grapes, and figs, with the pine-apple, banana, bread-fruit, pomegranate, <b>azarole,</b> date-palms, and {{some members of the}} orange-tribe. Poorer varieties of these same fruits either habitually or occasionally yield seed. (18/104. Lindley 'Theory of Horticulture' pages 175-179; Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 2 page 106; Pickering 'Races of Man;' Gallesio 'Teoria della Riproduzione' l816 pages 101-110. Meyen 'Reise um Erde' Th. 2 s. 214 states that at Manilla one variety of the banana is full of seeds: and Chamisso (Hooker's 'Bot. Misc.' volume 1 page 310) describes a variety of the bread-fruit in the Mariana Islands with small fruit, containing seeds which are frequently perfect. Burnes in his 'Travels in Bokhara' remarks on the pomegranate seeding in Mazenderan, as a remarkable peculiarity.) Most horticulturists look at the great size and anomalous development of the fruit as the cause, and sterility as the result; but the opposite view, as we shall presently see, is more probable.|$|E

5000|$|Crataegus azarolus is {{a species}} of {{hawthorn}} known by the common names <b>azarole,</b> azerole, and Mediterranean medlar. It is native to the Mediterranean Basin and is a common plant there, growing on sites comparable to those the European common hawthorn grows on. In the Arab countries it is the commonest of the hawthorn species; in the Arabic language the term [...] "common hawthorn" [...] means the <b>azarole</b> hawthorn. When growing in the wild the azerole bears plentiful crops of haw fruits, which {{are similar to the}} haws of the European common hawthorn, but plumper.|$|E
40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Belgium, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluation Member State (EMS), compiled an application to modify the existing MRL for the active substance kresoxim-methyl in <b>azaroles.</b> In order to accommodate for the intended uses in EU of kresoxim-methyl, Belgium proposed to raise the existing MRL from the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0. 05 * mg/kg to 0. 9 mg/kg. Belgium drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data were sufficient to derive a MRL proposal of 0. 9 mg/kg for <b>azaroles.</b> Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of kresoxim-methyl on the commodity under consideration at the validated LOQ of 0. 01 mg/kg. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed use of kresoxim methyl on <b>azaroles</b> will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference value and therefore, is unlikely to pose a consumer health risk...|$|R
5000|$|Reports {{that it is}} {{native to}} Spain appear {{to be based on}} {{misidentification}} of the Common Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna). Some report it is only known in cultivation and not in the wild. It is thought by some [...] to be a hybrid between the Crataegus monogyna and another species, perhaps the <b>Azarole</b> hawthorn (Crataegus azarolus). If it is of hybrid origin it may have arisen more than once.|$|E
50|$|Early {{ideas that}} it {{originated}} in North America {{were replaced by}} the perception that it has {{more in common with}} species from eastern Europe. Favouring an American origin was Joseph Paxton, who in 1840 listed it as having been introduced into Britain from North America in 1816. Also, A. P. de Candolle published its country of origin as North America in his Podromus in 1825. John Lindley in 1828 considered it to have little affinity with North American hawthorns, being closer to Eastern European species, and suggested it could be a relative of <b>Azarole</b> hawthorn (Crataegus azarolus), (under the name Crataegus maroccana Persoon). In the early twentieth century, W. J. Bean described it similarly, as a native of Armenia. Today, other authors also list it as native to Eastern Europe from Georgia and the Caucasus to nearby parts of Western Asia.|$|E
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} {{analyses of the}} yellow and red <b>azarole</b> phenolic extracts prepared from leaf, fruit peel/pulp, and syrup were comparatively investigated. The yellow <b>azarole</b> was found significantly richer in polyphenols than the redfruit species. Hyperoside was the main phenolic in both yellow and red <b>azarole</b> leaves and only in yellow fruits, whereas procyanidin B 2 was the major compound in red fruits. Yellow <b>azarole</b> leaf and fruit peel extracts exhibited the strongest antioxidant activities using DPPH (≈ 168 and 79 μmol TEAC/g fw, respectively) and FRAP (≈ 378 and 161 μmol Fe 2 +/g fw, respectively) assays. The highest antibacterial activities were recorded for the yellow <b>azarole</b> leaf and fruit peel extracts, especially against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. The low phenolic content of the syrups contrasted with their significant antioxidant and antimicrobial potentials, which were correlated to their hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) (furan derivative amounts) content...|$|E
40|$|<b>Azarole</b> (Crataegus azarolus L.) is a {{fruit and}} {{ornamental}} tree cultivated for centuries in the Mediterranean area, which is presently becoming rare in Italy. Programs {{directed to the}} collection and characterisation of its genetic resources have been started, in order {{to contribute to the}} exploitation of this species. The main pomological traits and the content of sugars, acids and total polyphenols were determined in fruits at the ripening stage of five <b>azarole</b> accessions collected in two regions of Italy. The accessions were clearly differentiated by both biometric and chemical fruit characteristics. GHI 4 and GHI 7 were distinguished by bigger fruits and more tasty flesh than the other accessions. Sugar profiles of these two accessions were clearly differentiated by the high levels of sucrose, whereas this sugar was almost absent in the other accessions. Similar contents of total polyphenols, flavonoids and procyanidins were measured in all the accessions. The presence of good levels of these components with medicinal properties makes <b>azarole</b> fruits susceptible to exploitation in the field of food with nutraceutical interest...|$|E
40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Belgium hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), compiled an application to modify the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for the active substance fenhexamid in cranberries, blueberries, gooseberries and <b>azarole</b> (kiwiberry). In order to accommodate for the uses of fenhexamid under greenhouse conditions, Belgium proposed to raise the MRLs proposed during the review of the existing MRLs under Article 12 of the Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, to 15 mg/kg. Belgium drafted an evaluation report, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to extrapolate the MRL of 15 mg/kg set on currants to cranberries, blueberries, gooseberries and <b>azarole</b> (kiwiberry). Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of fenhexamid in the commodities under consideration. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed uses of fenhexamid on blueberries, cranberries, gooseberries and <b>azarole</b> (kiwiberry) will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicologica...|$|E
40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{activity of}} the different polyphenolic extracts prepared from Tunisian <b>azarole,</b> Crataegus azarolus and Crataegus monogyna (Rosaceae family) leaves, fruit peel, pulp and syrup was evaluated using cholesterol, liposome and rat liver-homogenate oxidation assays and cytotoxic activity in differentiated Caco- 2, undifferentiated Caco- 2, and B 16 F 10 melanoma cells. Protective effects were observed against thermal-cholesterol degradation at 140 °C for 1 h, which depended on the concentration {{and the type of}} the extract. Moreover, the pre-treatment with the phenolic extracts preserved liposomes and rat liver-homogenate from oxidative induced damage by Cu 2 + and Fe 2 + at 37 °C for 24 h and 2 h, respectively. <b>Azarole</b> phenolics inhibited the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and limited the production of oxidized compounds. Furthermore, within tested concentrations (0. 24 - 4. 8 mg/mL), all extracts did not show any toxic effect on differentiated Caco- 2 cells; while, they were found cytotoxic to cancer Caco- 2 cells, except, extracts of pulp and syrup of C. monogyna. Using B 16 F 10 melanoma cell model, only <b>azarole</b> pulp and syrup extracts were found toxic and induced the production of melanin in a dose-dependent manne...|$|E
40|$|<b>Azarole</b> (Crataegus azarolus L.), medlar (Mespilus germanica L.), {{and service}} tree (Sorbus domestica L.) are minor Pyrinae {{with a long}} {{tradition}} in Italy, but their cultivation for fruit production has been neglected in the past century. Old trees still survive as sparse plants in parks and gardens, near farmhouses or in abandoned fields. Erosion of genetic variability and loss of folk knowledge are consequences of this decline. Exploration started within the EU project GENRES 29 and continued thereafter in different areas of Italy, with the aims of identification, characterization and evaluation of accessions and collection of information about traditional and present use. A good amount of variability in pomological traits and fruit composition of <b>azarole</b> and service tree was found in Emilia Romagna and in the southernregions of Italy. <b>Azarole</b> accessions were clearly differentiated by sugars and organic acid profiles. Service tree fruits revealed a high content of fructose and a decrease of organic acids and polyphenols during ripening and bletting. These changes enablethe processing into different products (cider in the unripe stage, and jams, liqueurs, schnaps in the bletted stage). The multipurpose potential may offer good opportunities of exploitation. Nevertheless, the perspectives of in situ conservation are presently uncertain, because of plant and farmer ageing...|$|E
40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Spain, herewith {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State Spain, received an application from Syngenta Agro S. A. to raise the existing MRL for lambda-cyhalothrin in persimmon from the LOQ (0. 02 mg/kg) to 0. 1 mg/kg in support of a new intended SEU use. Belgium (hereafter the EMS Belgium) compiled an application to raise the existing MRL for lambda-cyhalothrin in <b>azarole</b> from the LOQ to 0. 2 mg/kg based on a new intended NEU use on kiwi berries (Actinidia arguta). The EMS Spain and the EMS Belgium drafted evaluation reports according to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which were submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA, the submitted supervised residue trials are sufficient to derive a MRL proposal of 0. 09 mg/kg for persimmon. The MRL proposal of 0. 2 mg/kg for <b>azarole</b> (including kiwi berries) is derived as an extrapolation from the available residue data on black currant. According to the EMS Belgium, the intended spray concentration of lambda-cyhalothrin on kiwi berries is identical to that in the black currant residue trials and thus these trials were considered appropriate to estimate residue levels in <b>azarole</b> (including kiwi berries). Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the intended use of lambda-cyhalothrin on the crops under consideration will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} {{protocol for}} efficient micropropagation {{was developed for}} <b>azarole</b> (Crataegus azarolus L.), a Mediterranean native species valuable for ornamental, fruit and medicinal purposes. Shoot cultures, established from axillary buds of adult tree, were multiplied on a modified LP medium supplied with 0. 9, 1. 8 or 3. 6 µM BA, or CPPU. The highest axillary shoot multiplication was obtained on modified LP medium supplied with 1. 8 µM BA. Concerning rooting, the highest percentage and number of roots was obtained with 19. 6 µM IBA applied for 5 days or 392 µM IBA applied for 1 day. The subsequent transferring to a medium solidified {{with a mix of}} agar and vermiculite was retained for further improvement of the root system...|$|E
