40|$|Supervision is not {{a simple}} construct. <b>Administrative</b> focused <b>supervision</b> is {{necessary}} {{for the development of the}} organization and to keep an organization running smoothly; the supervisor ensures policies and mandates of the organization are being met. Educational focused supervision is about the development of the supervisee. Many supervisors are tasked with dual role supervision in human service organizations. However, my question is: How compatible are these two functions of supervision and under what provisions should they be practiced. Some writers have argued that these two roles are not mutually beneficial when carried out by the same supervisor. While others have maintained that <b>administrative</b> and educative <b>supervision</b> should be utilized together for the best outcomes. This thesis explores compatibility of practicing <b>administrative</b> and educative <b>supervision</b> together, and will intimately look at the logistics for the practical application of these two functions as a dual role supervisor, through an autoethnographical lens.
