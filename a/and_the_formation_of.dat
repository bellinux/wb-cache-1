5|$|A related {{problem for}} aerobic organisms is {{oxidative}} stress. Here, processes including oxidative phosphorylation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> disulfide bonds during protein folding produce {{reactive oxygen species}} such as hydrogen peroxide. These damaging oxidants are removed by antioxidant metabolites such as glutathione and enzymes such as catalases and peroxidases.|$|E
5|$|All {{actinides}} are pyrophoric, {{especially when}} finely divided, that is, they spontaneously ignite upon reaction with air. The melting point of actinides {{does not have}} a clear dependence on the number of f-electrons. The unusually low melting point of neptunium and plutonium (~640°C) is explained by hybridization of 5f and 6d orbitals <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> directional bonds in these metals.|$|E

5|$|Bristol lies {{on one of}} the UK's lesser coalfields, {{and from}} the 17th century collieries opened in Bristol, and what is now North Somerset and South Gloucestershire. Though these {{prompted}} the construction of the Somerset Coal Canal, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> the Bristol Miners' Association, it was difficult to make mining profitable, and the mines closed after nationalisation.|$|E
5|$|Following Kasa-Vubu's reinstatement, {{there was}} an {{attempted}} rapprochement between the Congolese factions. Tshombe began negotiations {{for the end of}} the secession <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> a confederal Congo. Although a compromise agreement was reached, it was prevented from taking effect as negotiations broke down amid personal animosity between Kasa-Vubu and Tshombe. An attempted reconciliation in July 1961 led to the formation of a new government, led by Cyrille Adoula, which brought together deputies from both Lumumbist and South Kasai factions but also failed to bring a reconciliation with Katanga.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} of the Cyberpunk album, Billy Idol did not produce another {{original}} album until 2005, 13 years later. However, this was not due to {{the failure of}} the album, but rather his dissatisfaction with his producers at Chrysalis Records. With the founding of Sanctuary Records, an independent record label Idol felt positive about, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> a new band with Steve Stevens, Idol decided to produce Devil's Playground. Idol's later album featured a more power pop and classic rock sound similar to Idol's 80s style, and received middling reviews.|$|E

The depression moved briskly westward, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dean at 1500UTC on August 14. The storm's intensity continued to build although dry air and cooler air inflow from the north were slowing structural development.
