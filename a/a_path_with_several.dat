40|$|In systems biology {{new ways}} are {{required}} to analyze {{the large amount of}} existing data on regulation of cellular processes. Recent work can be roughly classified into either dynamical models of well-described subsystems, or coarse-grained descriptions of the topology of the molecular networks at the scale of the whole organism. In order to bridge these two disparate approaches one needs to develop simplified descriptions of dynamics and topological measures which address the propagation of signals in molecular networks. Transmission of a signal across a reaction node depends on the presence of other reactants. It will typically be more demanding to transmit a signal across a reaction node with more input links. Sending signals along <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>with</b> <b>several</b> subsequent reaction nodes also increases the constraints on the presence of other proteins in the overall network. Therefore counting in and out links along reactions of a potential pathway can give insight into the signaling properties of a particular molecular network. Here, we consider the directed network of protein regulation in E. coli, characterizing its modularity in terms of its potential to transmit signals. W...|$|E

40|$|The way Americans view, think about, {{and consume}} food {{has been on}} <b>a</b> winding <b>path</b> <b>with</b> <b>several</b> {{definite}} shifts in philosophy {{since the start of}} the nineteenth century. Ideas about food changed significantly during the post-war era. When WWII ended, the food industry worked to create a peacetime market out of wartime production methods. Factories continued to can, freeze, and dehydrate food just as they had done during the war. This effort resulted in the popularity and widespread abundance of convenience foods: foods that were processed in some way for easier preparation or consumption. The abundance of convenience foods caused a flurry of food companies to compete for business. Food advertisements placed in magazines, newspapers, on television, and other places used different tactics in order to get consumers to purchase a variety of food products. Ladies’ Home Journal, the magazine at the focus of this study, aimed at a female audience of housewives and mothers. The question that this study intends to answer is: what types of food advertisements can be found within Ladies’ Home Journal, and how did each type of food advertisement try to convince consumers to purchase its product? My analysis of convenience food advertisements in Ladies’ Home Journal from 1945 - 1954 shows that manufacturers employed many more ideas than convenience in their advertisements for convenience foods. In fact, they used seven different types of food advertisements: convenience, food shortages, increased consumption, appeals to mothers, appeals to wives, health benefits, and food processing. Each of 2 these advertising groups uses a mix of logical and emotional rhetoric to persuade consumers...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{best known}} for her mural work, she did not begin this work until later in life. One reason for this was that women did not win {{commissions}} for murals during most of the 20th century, and many of her years were taken up with health concerns, family responsibilities, teaching and her involvement with the Communist Party. Her mural work consists of three projects: one at the Escuela Superior de Agricultura Antonio Narro (now the Universidad Autónoma Agraria), the Instituto de Ciencias y Artes de Saltillo (today the Tecnológico de Saltillo) and the last at the then municipal hall of the city of Saltillo (today the Centro Cultural Vito Alessio Robles). [...] At the beginning of the 1950s, Huerta began looking for opportunities to paint mural, although this endeavour was still mostly closed to women. Her best opportunity was in the home city, where her family still had influence. Negotiations for the first work took <b>a</b> winding <b>path</b> <b>with</b> <b>several</b> municipal presidents, state official and directors of federal cultural institutions. [...] Although initial approval was gained first for the Instituto de Ciencias y Artes, in the end the first project was at the Escuela Superior de Agricultura Antonio Narro in 1952. This project was done at the auditorium of the campus being built at the time, on which she collaborated with her daughter Electa and fellow Coahuila painter, Eloy Cerecero. Soon after, she began the Instituto de Ciencias y Artes project, working with María Romana Herrera, the daughter of her former teacher, and Chacha Martínez Morton. This mural has a feminist theme, with most of the protagonists being women. Upon completion of these projects, Huerta was offered a teaching position in printing and painting by the state of Coahuila, supported by INBA.|$|R
40|$|Calaverite, krennerite, and sylvanite are Au-Ag-tellurides {{with close}} {{compositions}} and related crystal structures. Previous experimental {{studies show that}} both calaverite and sylvanite transform to porous “mustard” gold under hydrothermal conditions; however the transformation of sylvanite follows <b>a</b> complex reaction <b>path</b> <b>with</b> <b>several</b> intermediary products, contrasting with the simple replacement of calaverite by gold. Here we report results of an experimental study of the transformation of krennerite, a phase with Ag contents intermediate between those of calaverite and sylvanite. Krennerite was replaced by Au-Ag alloy under all experimental conditions explored (160 to 220 °C; pHT ~ 3 and 9; varying availability of oxygen). No reaction was observed at the same temperature under dry conditions. The replacement was pseudomorphic and the resulting Au-Ag alloy was porous, consisting of worm-like aggregates with diameters ranging from 200 nm to 1 μm. The replacement of krennerite proceeds via an interface coupled dissolution-(re) precipitation (ICDR) reaction mechanism. Tellurium is lost to the bulk solution as Te(IV) complexes, and may precipitate away from the dissolution site. In contrast, Au-Ag alloy precipitates locally near the krennerite dissolution site. Overall, the hydrothermal alteration of krennerite {{is very similar to}} that of calaverite, but differs from the alteration of sylvanite, for which multi-step reaction paths led to complex products and textures under similar conditions. These striking differences are driven by the competition between solid-state reactions and ICDR reaction in sylvanite. This reflects the fact that a metastable, Ag-rich calaverite nucleates on sylvanite during the early steps of its dissolution, {{as a result of the}} close relationship between the structures of these two minerals and the enrichment in Au, Ag, and Te in solution at the reaction front. In contrast, for calaverite and krennerite, no such phase precipitates, and both minerals are transformed in a pseudomorphic manner into Au-Ag alloy.

50|$|A linear alkane, for the {{purposes}} of the Hosoya index, may be represented as <b>a</b> <b>path</b> graph without any branching. <b>A</b> <b>path</b> <b>with</b> one vertex and no edges (corresponding to the methane molecule) has one (empty) matching, so its Hosoya index is one; <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>with</b> one edge (ethane) has two matchings (one with zero edges and one with one edges), so its Hosoya index is two. Propane (<b>a</b> length-two <b>path)</b> has three matchings: either of its edges, or the empty matching. n-butane (<b>a</b> length-three <b>path)</b> has five matchings, distinguishing it from isobutane which has four. More generally, a matching in <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>with</b> k edges either forms a matching in the first k &minus; 1 edges, or it forms a matching in the first k &minus; 2 edges together with the final edge of the path.
