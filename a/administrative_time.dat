This paper empirically investigates what organizational factors can enable or inhibit FP and why it is so. Preliminary results from three cases in two manufacturing industries indicate that FP application can be influenced by a cross-functional approach to new product development, integration of production-planning tasks across multiple product families, integration between the marketing and operations departments in sales forecasts generation, workforce flexibility and adoption of coordination mechanisms that help reduce the <b>administrative</b> <b>times</b> in the order fulfillment process...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we assess the {{relative}} effectiveness of user charges and <b>administrative</b> waiting <b>times</b> {{as a tool}} for rationing public healthcare in Italy. We measure demand elasticities by estimating a simultaneous equation model of GP primary care visits, public specialist consultations and private specialist consultations, as if they were part of an incomplete system of demand. We find that for public specialist consultations, own price elasticity of demand is about - 0. 3, while elasticity to <b>administrative</b> waiting <b>time</b> is about -. 04. No substitution exists between the demand for public and private specialists, so that user charges act as a net deterrent for over-consumption. The public provision of healthcare does not induce the wealthy to opt out. Moreover our evidence suggests that user charges and waiting lists do not serve redistributive purposes.

40|$|Dropout is {{a common}} {{occurrence}} in longitudinal studies. Building upon the pattern-mixture modeling approach within the Bayesian paradigm, we propose a general framework of varying-coefficient models for longitudinal data with informative dropout, where measurement times can be irregular and dropout can occur {{at any point in}} continuous time (not just at observation <b>times)</b> together with <b>administrative</b> censoring. Specifically, we assume that the longitudinal outcome process depends on the dropout process through its model parameters. The unconditional distribution of the repeated measures is a mixture over the dropout (<b>administrative</b> censoring) <b>time</b> distribution, and the continuous dropout <b>time</b> distribution with <b>administrative</b> censoring is left completely unspecified. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo to sample from the posterior distribution of the repeated measures given the dropout (administrative censoring) times; Bayesian bootstrapping on the observed dropout (<b>administrative</b> censoring) <b>times</b> is carried out to obtain marginal covariate effects. We illustrate the proposed framework using data from a longitudinal study of depression in HIV-infected women; the strategy for sensitivity analysis on unverifiable assumption is also demonstrated...|$|R

Despite this, the impact of molecular genetics on health care services {{has yet to be}} evaluated. In order to begin this assessment, clinical genetic workload was prospectively collected from cases where molecular genetic testing was considered. Participation involved all 16 urban and outreach genetic centers regionalized to service the entire population of 10 million within the Canadian province of Ontario. Molecular genetic testing has been clinically available for > 5 years, as part of a publicly supported genetic network in which there are no direct costs to residents. Cross-sectional data were collected on 1, 101 clients from 544 families involving 1, 742 clinical actions relating to diseases in which molecular (DNA) tests were considered. Median times per clinical genetic action were as follows: formal counseling (60 min), case review (15 min), phone call (10 min), letter (15 min), specimen arrangement (15 min), and interpretation of molecular test results (10 min). Times varied significantly with the inheritance pattern of the disease, topics involved, and location. For any given genetic case, multiple clinical actions resulted in substantial time spent by the genetic professional. Clerical and <b>administrative</b> <b>times</b> were not captured.
