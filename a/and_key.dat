40|$|A {{number of}} <b>key</b> <b>and</b> foreign <b>key</b> {{specifications}} {{have been proposed}} for XML data [6, 28, 38, 7]. However, {{little is known about}} the consistency analysis of <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> foreign <b>keys</b> together with DTDs. That is, given a DTD D and a finite set Σ of <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> foreign <b>keys,</b> is there any (finite) XML document that both conforms to D and satisfies Σ? This issue is important because one wants to know whether XML specifications with DTDs <b>and</b> <b>keys,</b> foreign keys are meaningful. This paper investigates the consistency problems associated with <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> foreign <b>keys</b> for XML. We show that the problem is undecidable for a class of <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> foreign <b>keys</b> defined in terms of XML attributes. In contrast to its trivial counterpart in relational databases, this result demonstrates that the interaction between DTDs and integrity constraints is highly intricate. This negative result suggests us study unary <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> foreign <b>keys,</b> which are the most common constraints used in practice. We characterize these [...] ...|$|R

Mötley Crüe released Theatre of Pain, Ratt's second album Invasion of Your Privacy, Dokken's third album Under Lock <b>and</b> <b>Key,</b> Stryper's first release Soldiers Under Command, Bon Jovi's second release 7800° Fahrenheit, and Autograph's second album That's The Stuff. Los Angeles continued to foster the most important scene around the Sunset Strip, with groups like London, which had originally formed as a glam rock band in the 1970s, and had seen future members of Mötley Crüe, Cinderella and Guns N' Roses pass through its ranks, finally releasing their début album Non Stop Rock in 1985 as well.|$|E
5|$|Although Tito's headquarters, {{along with}} several other Partisan organisations, was {{temporarily}} disrupted <b>and</b> <b>key</b> staff were lost during the operation, all Partisan organisations were quickly re-located and resumed operation. Drvar reverted to Partisan control {{within a few weeks}} of the operation. The operation was a failure, as Tito, his principal headquarters staff and the allied military personnel escaped, despite their presence in Drvar {{at the time of the}} airborne assault. The operation failed due to a number of factors, including Partisan resistance in the town itself and along the approaches to Drvar. The failure of the various German intelligence agencies to share the limited intelligence available on Tito's exact location also contributed to the unsuccessful outcome for the Germans, and this failure to share intelligence was compounded by a lack of contingency planning by the commander of the German airborne force.|$|E

5|$|Antibody and antigen {{interact}} by spatial complementarity (lock <b>and</b> <b>key).</b> The molecular forces {{involved in}} the Fab-epitope interaction are weak and non-specific – for example electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals forces. This means binding between antibody and antigen is reversible, and the antibody's affinity towards an antigen is relative rather than absolute. Relatively weak binding also means {{it is possible for}} an antibody to cross-react with different antigens of different relative affinities.|$|E
5|$|Arnold {{was born}} in Connecticut and was a {{merchant}} operating ships on the Atlantic Ocean when the war broke out in 1775. He joined the growing army outside Boston and distinguished himself through acts of intelligence and bravery. His actions included the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775, defensive and delaying tactics at the Battle of Valcour Island on Lake Champlain in 1776 (allowing American forces time to prepare New York's defenses), the Battle of Ridgefield, Connecticut (after which {{he was promoted to}} major general), operations in relief of the Siege of Fort Stanwix, <b>and</b> <b>key</b> actions during the pivotal Battles of Saratoga in 1777, in which he suffered leg injuries that halted his combat career for several years.|$|E

For the next few years, his whereabouts are not known for certain, but he appears to have lived an unsettled life in the English Midlands and Yorkshire. In 1887, he was making a living as a hawker, selling small items such as pencils <b>and</b> <b>key</b> rings on the streets of Snow Hill, Birmingham.|$|E
40|$|<b>Key</b> <b>and</b> foreign <b>key</b> {{constraints}} {{are useful}} for XML [5] data in semantic specification, query optimization and more importantly, for information preservation in data exchange. Several XML proposals, e. g., XML Schema [28] and XML Data [21], support <b>key</b> <b>and</b> foreign <b>key</b> specifications. These constraints, however, may not be finitely satisfiable in the XML context. More specifically, given a DTD D and a finite set Σ of <b>key</b> <b>and</b> foreign <b>key</b> constraints, there may not exist any finite XML documents that both conform to D and satisfy Σ. This paper investigates finite satisfiability problems associated with <b>key</b> <b>and</b> foreign <b>key</b> constraints for XML. We show that DTDs impose a class of cardinality constraints on XML documents, and these cardinality constraints interact with <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> foreign <b>keys.</b> We investigate the interaction and in particular, establish complexity results {{for the analysis of}} finite satisfiability of <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> foreign <b>keys</b> defined in two constraint languages.

U.S. membership in SEATO provided the United States with {{a rationale for}} a large-scale U.S. military intervention in Southeast Asia.

5|$|Each 22-minute episode takes {{approximately}} {{a year to}} complete; three to four episodes are produced simultaneously. Storyboard artists depict scenes using SketchBook Pro. Adapting these boards to limited animation, studio DHX Media handles the designs, poses <b>and</b> <b>key</b> frames of movement for each character appearing in a given scene for an episode, as well as background art. DHX hands these assets to a separate studio, where the remaining animation is finished using Adobe Flash. The speed of production is throttled slightly by Blythe having two unique outfits per episode, according to director Joel Dickie. Supervising director Dallas Parker similarly explained that the variety of assets created for each episode challenged the process of Flash animation in reusing movements.|$|E
5|$|Early 21st-century research, however, {{suggested}} that Master James' role, and Savoyard influence more generally, {{may have been}} overstated. The stonework of the sites in North Wales is of much higher quality than that in North Italy, <b>and</b> <b>key</b> features – such as the gatehouses – are not seen in Savoyard. Research indicates that Master James also appears {{to have had a}} stronger project management function, rather than an architectural design role, {{in the development of the}} sites. Furthermore, in some cases the relevant Savoy structures were built only after James had left the region, and would never have been seen by the architect. The similarity in architectural details may, therefore, be the result of the wider role played by Savoy craftsmen and engineers on the projects, rather than that of a single individual.|$|E

Edward called a new meeting {{of members of the}} Church <b>and</b> <b>key</b> barons in January 1309, and the leading earls then gathered in March and April, possibly under the leadership of Thomas, the Earl of Lancaster. Another parliament followed, which refused to allow Gaveston to return to England, but offered to grant Edward additional taxes if he agreed to a programme of reform.|$|E
