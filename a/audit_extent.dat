40|$|Objective: To test an {{evaluation}} framework designed to evaluate {{implementation of the}} North Queensland Indigenous communities between August and December 2005. Setting: Both communities are located in Cape York, North Queensland. Community A has an estimated population of around 600 people; Community B has an enumerated population of 750, although health centre records indicate a higher number. Participants: Process evaluation involved health centre staff in both communities; clinical audits used random samples from the adult population (each sample n = 30); ethnographic fieldwork was conducted with resident population. Main outcome measures: Health centre scores and qualitative findings using a System Assessment Tool; clinical <b>audits</b> – <b>extent</b> to which scheduled services recorded; selected primary health performance indicators; qualitative ethnographic findings. Results: On almost all indicators, implementation of NQICDS had progressed further in Community A than in Community B; however, some common issues emerged, especially lack of linkages between health centres and other groups, and lack of support for client self-management. Conclusions: The evaluation framework is an effective and acceptable framework for monitoring implementation of the NQICDS at the primary health centre level...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{planning}} and performing financial statement audits, auditors are required to make judgments regarding client risk. These judgments permeate the audit process, driving decisions regarding client acceptance, <b>audit</b> pricing, the <b>extent</b> of <b>audit</b> testing, {{and the nature of}} auditors' written opinions. Although auditors may aim to assess each client's risk independently, prior research suggests individuals' draw on their idiosyncratic experiences and environments for benchmarks against which to contrast the case at hand. These "contrast effects" can result in judgments that deviate from those that would be reached using normative principles and may cause bias in auditors' assessment of client risk. Consistent with this theory, the archival evidence presented in this paper shows that, after controlling for clients' actual risk levels, auditors perform more (less) conservative audits and charge higher (lower) audit fees when clients appear riskier (less risky) in the context of other clients audited by the same practice office. Moreover, clients subject to increased (decreased) conservatism and higher (lower) audit fees due to auditors' biases are more (less) likely to switch auditors during the following period...|$|R

Methods: A large, prospective observational study. All ophthalmology operating theatres in the National Health Service of the United Kingdom were invited to participate. During the initial week, participants were asked to complete an anonymous Report Form for every LA administered for intraocular surgery. Reporting of complications only continued for a total of three months. To validate the response rate, the theatre records of randomly-selected hospitals were inspected. Results: In the initial week, 2, 827 correctly completed forms were returned. Participation rate was calculated to be 72. 8 % (95 % Confidence Intervals: 56. 4 %, 96. 3 %). Anaesthesia techniques were: 70 % LA alone, 5. 8 % LA with sedation, and 24. 2 % general anaesthesia. LA techniques were: 65. 6 % peribulbar, 16. 9 % retrobulbar, 6. 7 % sub-Tenon's, 4. 4 % subconjunctival, 2. 9 % topical, and 2. 3 % combinations.

Four case studies reveal that audit committees need comfort {{with respect to the}} control environment. Thanks to their internal position, their familiarity with the company, and their position close to people across the company, internal audit seems to be the most suitable one to provide comfort and be the ‘guard of the corporate culture’. Furthermore, audit committees need comfort regarding the internal controls in high-risk areas. Besides internal audit’s assurance role, active involvement in the improvement of these internal controls provides a significant level of comfort to the audit committee. Their unique conceptual and companyspecific knowledge about risk management and internal control, combined with the right inter-personal skills, enables internal audit to provide this comfort. Formal audit reports and presentations, together with informal contacts, seem to be important ways of providing this comfort. Finally, it becomes clear that the overall level of comfort in the audit committee can be enhanced through a ‘joint audit approach’ between internal and external audit. internal audit, audit committee, risk management, internal control, comfort, expert, sociology of professions, case studies...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{previous}} {{study examined the}} communication process within the emergency department (ED) and identified a complex process with many opportunities for breakdown and error. In this paper the first two interventions {{in a series of}} studies to improve this highly vulnerable communication process are described. AIM: To improve the reliability of two steps of the communication process identified as having a high probability of failure: (1) transfer of information between the ambulance crew and the emergency staff; and (2) preparation of written documentation following patient assessment. METHODS: Quantitative assessments of the reliability of communication were carried out to establish the extent of problems highlighted during the failures modes and effects analysis (FMEA) previously described. Improvements to the process were then introduced, and the process re-examined {{to assess the impact of}} the changes and reduction of the likelihood and severity of the failure mode. RESULTS: The studies demonstrated very high levels of communication failure, particularly in transfer of written information from the ambulance crew. Countermeasures were introduced which resulted in a substantial reduction in missing and incorrect information. In addition, there was a threefold improvement in the number of correct clinical documents used by doctors in the resuscitation room. CONCLUSION: Observational study and <b>audit</b> revealed the <b>extent</b> of process failures identified in the initial FMEA process. With the introduction of simple changes to the communication system, a marked improvement in the availability and quality of pertinent clinical information was achieved with considerable implications for the timeliness and quality of care provided to patients...|$|R
40|$|The <b>audit</b> {{examined}} the <b>extent</b> {{to which the}} 11 Victorian public sector (VPS) departments and Victoria Police {{meet the requirements of}} the Freedom of Information Act 1982. Freedom of Information (FOI) is a cornerstone of a thriving democracy. Since FOI legislation was introduced 30 years ago, Victoria has gone from being at the forefront of FOI law and administration to one of the least progressive jurisdictions in Australia. Over time, apathy and resistance to scrutiny have adversely affected the operation of the Act, restricting the amount of information being released. As a result, agencies are not meeting the object of the Act, which is ‘to extend as far as possible the right of the community to access information’. The public’s right to timely, comprehensive and accurate information is consequently being frustrated. The VPS’s systemic failure to support this right is a failure to deliver Parliament’s intent. The prevailing culture and lack of transparent processes allow principal officers—secretaries and chief executive officers of agencies—to avoid fulfilling their responsibilities. Principal officers are not being held to account for their agency’s underperformance and non-compliance. Agencies are routinely disregarding the 45 - day statutory time limit for processing requests and the five-day ministerial noting period, and there are serious flaws in record keeping practices and FOI searches in the Department of Human Services and Victoria Police. The Department of Justice has not satisfactorily fulfilled its role as lead agency for FOI. More effective leadership is required to promote an appropriate culture, improve transparency of government information and adequately inform Parliament and the community about FOI.

Method Retrospective analysis included randomly selected medical records of patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus treated by 18 family medicine teams at 5 locations in BH, included in the Canadian International Development Agency/World Health Organization project “Strengthening {{health care system in}} BH with focus on primary health care/family medicine model. ” Audit record form contained 24 questions on sex, age, diabetes type, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, family anamnesis, annual xaminations (HbA 1 C, BMI, lipid profile or total cholesterol, blood creatinin, neurological examination, urinanalysis for albuminuria, foot care, and examination of ocular fundus), smoking habits, alcohol consumption, patient education, prescribed insulin and other drugs, and patient’s health care-seeking behavior. Standardized and record forms were returned anonymously with 99. 3 % response rate. Results Records of 536 patients with diabetes were analyzed (64 % women and 87 % patients with diabetes mellitus type 2). Family medicine teams showed poor compliance with established criteria for diabetes control. Metabolic control (69. 5 %) was acceptable, but the level of monitoring complications of diabetes (foot and ocular fundus examined in 53. 4 % and 53 % of patients, respectively) was low. There were also considerable variations in diabetes management between different centers as well as between the teams in the same center.

40|$|The Government of New South Wales is {{not able}} to provide {{assurance}} that it is safeguarding its holdings of sensitive personal information because its policy has not been properly implemented, concludes this audit. The public sector legitimately gathers and uses personal information about citizens, and shares it within and outside government. But personal information can be misused with potentially serious consequences. If the wrong people get access to sensitive personal information an individual can suffer financial loss or damage to their credit rating, have their medical records compromised, or suffer from threats and harassment. The people of NSW have every right to expect their and their families’ private details are secure regardless of which government agency holds it. The Government’s current policy on Security of Electronic Information acknowledges its duty to safeguard its large information holdings and to provide credible assurance that it is doing so. Under the policy, agencies were to establish and maintain an Information Security Management System (ISMS) that complies with the international standard and covers all electronic information. They were to get and keep the main parts of their ISMS, including the parts that hold sensitive private information, certified to that standard. And the Government Chief Information Office was to survey agencies each year and report to Cabinet. This <b>audit</b> assesses the <b>extent</b> to which the Government can provide assurance that it is safeguarding its holdings of sensitive personal information. The audit does this by examining how well the Government’s policy has been implemented. It concludes that the NSW Government {{is not able}} to provide assurance that it is safeguarding its holdings of sensitive personal information because its policy has not been properly implemented. This is likely to remain the case until there are clear, mandatory, minimum standards that agencies sign up to, and scrutiny of performance against these standards is strengthened...|$|R

The survey results indicated that while ethics codes and training, and to a lesser <b>extent,</b> <b>audits,</b> do influence local government employees to be ethical, the most critical component of promoting ethical behavior is ethical leadership. The survey was followed up with a case study at a local government in the Midwest. During this phase of the research, 58 individuals were interviewed and asked questions about how their government's ethics code, training, leadership, and audits influence their work. Again, the research results indicated that ethical leadership is {{the most important factor in}} encouraging employees to be ethical. The interviewees also indicated they are influenced by ethics codes and training, and some of them said that audits also affect the way they perform their jobs. To gather more information about both the survey results and the case study information, interviews were conducted with 25 city auditors in ten states. Again, the auditors indicated that ethical leadership is the most important tool for promoting ethical behavior among employees. Most of them also argued that ethics codes and training are necessary to develop an ethical organizational culture. Some of them also said that audits are useful in this regard, particularly as an oversight to help monitor employee behavior. But others did not consider audits a good tool for promoting ethical behavior. They argued that few of their audits cover ethics specifically and as such, cannot be a tool for promoting ethical behavior.

40|$|This <b>audit</b> {{assessed}} the <b>extent</b> {{to which the}} Department of the Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office have improved the management of tax expenditure estimates. Overall conclusionTax expenditures are revenues a government forgoes in pursuit of its policy objectives, including its medium-term fiscal strategy. Tax expenditures have been {{an important part of}} the Australian income tax system since the early 1900 ’s, when tax exempt invalid and old age pensions were introduced. In some areas, such as the retirement income system, they are heavily integrated into the Government’s policy framework. The number and aggregate value of tax expenditures have increased substantially over time and were estimated in 2011 – 12 to be around $ 111 billion. This represents a significant level when viewed in the context of the Australian Government Budget. The ANAO’s 2008 audit and subsequent JCPAA review encouraged improvements to the administration of tax expenditures through better integration of tax expenditures into the Budget process, systematic review to ensure that tax expenditure items continue to meet their intended objectives and improved reporting in the annual TES. 20 Progress by the Treasury and the ATO in implementing the recommendations in the 2008 audit and JCPAA review has been slow. Treasury advised that, facing reduced resourcing, it has focussed on providing advice on the Government’s key revenue priorities, as well as servicing the review of Australia’s future tax system and other key reviews. Of the recommendations in the 2008 audit and JCPAA review, only two ANAO recommendations have been fully implemented. The remaining recommendations, which continue to be relevant, have only been partially addressed. The status of the recommendations that have not been fully implemented is as follows: processes have been put in place to better integrate tax expenditures into the Budget process, although there is the potential to increase the quantification of tax expenditures resulting from new policy proposals in the relevant Budget Papers (relating to ANAO Recommendation No. 2); the systematic review and evaluation of tax expenditures on an ongoing basis commenced in 2008 but ceased in 2011, without publicly reporting the results (relating to ANAO Recommendation No. 1); the Treasury has not advanced the development of standards or pursued international methods of reporting (relating to ANAO Recommendation No. 3 and JCPAA Recommendation No. 8); and there has been no measurable improvement to the reliability and quantification of the Treasury’s tax expenditure estimates over time (relating to ANAO Recommendation No. 6 (a) and 6 (c), and JCPAA Recommendation No. 9) ...|$|R
40|$|This <b>audit</b> {{assesses the}} <b>extent</b> to which {{government}} agencies create, manage {{and dispose of}} records in accordance with key business, legal and policy requirements. The agencies included in the audit were the: Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (Customs); Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC); and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury). The audit also considered the Archives’ response to Recommendation No. 1 from ANAO Audit Report No. 6 2006 – 07 Recordkeeping including the Management of Electronic Records, including whether they had clarified Australian Government records management requirements for agencies. A key element of sound public administration and accountability is adequate recording or documentation {{of the business of}} government. To achieve this, agencies need to develop records management frameworks and systems designed to ensure that records are appropriately managed. This commences with the creation and subsequent capture of records in records management systems, through to their maintenance and use, and ultimately their transfer to the National Archives of Australia (the Archives) or destruction. Records management needs to be seen as important within the governance, resourcing and information management arrangements of an agency for it to effectively support the management of business activities and risks, and to satisfy records management requirements. The requirements that Australian Government agencies need to meet in relation to records management derive from multiple sources. Access to, preservation and destruction of information created and received when undertaking Australian Government business is governed by the Archives Act 1983 (Archives Act). A key focus of the Archives Act is authorisation of the disposal or destruction of records by the Archives approving records authorities. Records management obligations are also contained in other Acts including the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 (FMA Act). The Archives also has a key role in establishing standards, and providing guidance and assistance to agencies in managing their records management responsibilities. An important piece of guidance issued by the Archives is Check up 2. 0, which establishes the minimum requirements for information and records management. These requirements cover agencies’ information and records management arrangements and practices, including frameworks, records’ creation, capture and destruction, and business systems. A number of other Australian Government agencies have issued policies, standards and guidelines relevant to the management of records, including electronic records. For example, the Attorney-General’s Department has established the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF), which outlines mandatory minimum security requirements for all agencies, and has implications for records management...|$|R
40|$|Past {{studies have}} {{recognised}} that a country's accounting system, including disclosure requirements and practice, does not develop {{in a vacuum}} but is shaped {{by a number of}} influences. Although several studies have been undertaken to identify factors affecting disclosure in various countries including Jordan, disclosure in compliance with all related and relevant International Accounting Standards (IAS), factors influencing disclosure in compliance with IAS and the financial consequences of increased disclosure in compliance with IAS have not been explored. This research therefore has looked at the development of disclosure in compliance with all related and relevant IAS, the factors influencing disclosure in compliance with IAS and the financial consequences of increased disclosure in compliance with IAS in Jordan. The investigation concentrated on the empirical analysis of- 1) The impact of IAS adoption on the Jordanian Industrial Companies (JIC) listed on Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) extent of disclosure over the period 1995 - 2000, and: 2) The impact of five company-specific factors (company size, audit firm, industry type, profitability, and capital structure) on the extent of disclosure in compliance with IAS of JIC overt he period 1995 - 2000, and: 3) The financial consequences of adopting IAS, more specifically the impact of adopting IAS on systematic risk, unsystematic risk, risk premium, cost of equity capital, and share price volatility of JIC listed on ASE over the period 1996 - 2000. The development of accounting reporting and regulations in Jordan in connection with the country economy development was reviewed by highlighting the reasons forced toward adopting the IAS through the Companies Act and Amman Stock Exchange requirements. Such a review provides relevant background to the issue to be investigated in this study. A survey of accounts of 50 JIC over the period 1995 - 2000 was undertaken to investigate the influence of the IAS on the extent of disclosure in Jordan. In this investigation, the selected companies' extent of disclosure in compliance with the IAS over the years was examined by conducting both parametric and nonparametric tests. The impact of company-specific factors, on the other hand, was assessed by looking at the association between selected factors and the extent of disclosure in compliance with IAS in the annual reports of all JIC that met the criteria required over six differenty ears (1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 a, nd 2 000). Both univariate (parametric and non-parametric statistics) and multivariate(multiple regression) analyses were carried out in testing the significance of the association. As far as the financial consequences are concerned, the study investigated the impact of adopting the IAS on the JIC systematic risk, unsystematic risk, risk premium, cost of equity capital, and share price volatility over five different years (1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000). For such an investigation, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and the Market Model were employed. In this investigation, the selected companies' systematic risk, cost of equity capital, and share price volatility over the years was examined by conducting both parametric and non-parametric tests. The selected companies' unsystematic risk, however, was investigated by conducting the F-test. In addition, clearly {{it could be argued that}} the change in the cost of equity capital as a financial consequence of adopting the IAS might be influenced by other factors, namely: business risk and financial risk. Multivariate (multiple regression) analyses were carried out, therefore, in testing the significance of the association between the cost of equity capital and the extent of disclosure in compliance with IAS after controlling for the variables business risk and financial risk. The study results revealed that although the adoption for the IAS started in the year 1998, the significant change in the extent of disclosure started before that year. As a consequence, it can be seen that there was a drift up in the extent of disclosure regarding the mandatory action in 1998 for implementing the IAS and not a jump up as was expected to be seen. The study has found that JIC were not fully adopting the IAS. Chosen company specific factors, therefore, were tested for possible explanation of the variation in the extent of disclosure in compliance with IAS. The results revealed that there were considerable variations in the extent of disclosure by JIC for each of the six years covered in this study. Company size and, to a lesser <b>extent,</b> <b>audit</b> firm and industry type appear to be the best explanatory variables in explaining differences in the extent of disclosure in compliance with IAS among JIC included in this study over the period 1995 - 2000 suggesting that JIC have been influenced by company-specific factors. Regarding the financial consequences of adopting the IAS, however, the systematic risk and cost of equity capital, to some extent, was found to be significantly influenced by the extent of disclosure in compliance with IAS of JIC. Such an influence is described as a'cumulative' influence. Whereas, it has not been found that unsystematic risk, and share price volatility was significantly influenced by the adoption of IAS.

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1980 s, {{sustained}} {{efforts have been}} made to subject sub-Saharan African governments to popular control and to make their states work in ways that favour the broad mass of their peoples. These struggles to establish democracy emerged as a notable focus of scholarly and policy concerns in the 1990 s and remain so today. The present study examines how such struggles to establish democracy unfolded in the countries of the Greater Horn of Africa region - including in Burundi, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda - during the 1990 s. The study attempts to uncover the core components of the political regime transitions that were unfolding in these countries in the 1990 s; pays attention to the influential factors that shaped the transitions, clarifies the nature, behaviour and role of key actors in the transitions and generates a measure of the magnitude and direction of regime change in the Greater Horn of Africa region by the year 2000. The analysis done here shows that {{during the course of the}} 1990 s, countries in the Greater Horn of Africa region projected varied experiences of transition from authoritarian rule and by the turn of the new century, were steering a course between change in the democratic direction and continuity of authoritarian rule. By the year 2000 - the closing date of this study - we report that the range of transition outcomes in the Greater Horn of Africa region could be said to have clustered around three broad categories: stagnation, regression and [partial] progress or semi-democratization. In the stagnation cluster consisting of Somalia and Sudan, there was a notable absence of meaningful democratic reforms during the course of the 1990 s. In the regression cluster, consisting of Burundi, Eritrea and Rwanda, political reforms that were launched in these countries were reversed and authoritarian rule resurfaced. Finally, in the semi-democratization (or partial progress) cluster, a group of five countries - Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Djibouti - undertook a number of significant reforms in installing and exercising democratic mechanisms in their processes of governance. However, even in the cases of semi-democratization, the installation and exercise of democratic reforms was also accompanied by the preservation and/or reproduction of authoritarian enclaves that continued to strengthen previous anti-democratic values and stood in the way of deepened democratization. A major conclusion to be drawn from this study is that far from a decisive break with authoritarian rule, the processes of political regime transition that were unfolding in the countries of the Greater Horn of Africa region in the 1990 s evolved in multiple directions and not always toward democracy. Indeed, by the year 2000, the Greater Horn of Africa region could be said to have undergone change while simultaneously experiencing considerable continuity in the functioning of its politics. How might we explain these patterns of change and continuity in the region’s politics of transition? By way of answer, this work constructs a conceptual framework that draws attention to the notion of political leadership as crucial for our understanding and explaining how processes of democratization evolve. In short, the framework proposes that the dynamics and outcomes of political regime transitions are best understood as (a) the by-products of the actions and choices of the political leaders that stake a claim on the processes of transition (b) the distribution of political power among the contending political leaders and groups participating in the processes of transition (c) the resources political leaders bring to bear on the processes of transition (d) the relationships between political leaders and their followers during transition and (e) the opportunities and constraints provided by the environment in which the processes of transition unfold. To reflect upon the utility of these propositions, the study offers a case study of Kenya’s democratization process during the 1990 s. The ideas and analyses of this work are structured into eight chapters. The background, objective, research question, outline of the argument regarding the potential impact of political leadership on processes of democratization, methodology, contributions of the study, a road map on the organization of the chapters as well as limitations of the study is given in the introductory chapter. The second chapter examines several major themes that are central to understanding the notions of democracy and democratization. By closely tracing what actually happened, chapter 3 attempts to characterize the broad dynamics of the processes of regime transition in the countries of the Greater Horn of Africa region during the 1990 s. Here, a deliberate attempt is made to establish the key empirical components of the transitions and to interpret these empirical components with regard to the dating of the start of the transitions, the modes of transition and the factors that influenced the start of these transitions. Chapter 4 seeks to present a balance sheet of the state of democratization in the countries of the Horn of Africa by the year 2000. This is done by <b>auditing</b> the <b>extent</b> of progress countries in the Horn of Africa region made in the democratic direction. The following ingredients of democracy are used to measure the extent of progress: the broadening of popular participation and contestation through elections, the level of civic peace, the presence and viability of civil society, separation of powers, the expansion of civil and political liberties as well as respect for the rule of law. Based on this assessment of the extent of progress made in the democratic direction, we construct broad categories of transition outcomes and classify the countries of the Horn of Africa accordingly. Chapter 5 proposes some tools that might help us account for the dynamics and outcomes of the Horn of Africa’s regime transitions depicted in chapters 3 and 4. As already indicated, our tools are built around the notion of political leadership, which we contend is a central feature shaping social, economic and political processes in most African polities. Chapters 6 and 7 present a case study of Kenya’s process of democratization during the 1990 s. This is an illustrative case aimed at reflecting upon the utility of some of our propositions regarding the potential impact of political leadership on the evolution of processes of democratization. However, readers should be aware that in seeking to assess the impact of political leadership on Kenya’s process of democratization in the 1990 s, we do not aim to establish cause-effect relations but merely aspire to sketch out how the notion of political leadership may help us clarify particular dynamics of Kenya’s process of political transition during the 1990 s. In chapter 8, we summarize our findings regarding the experiences of the countries of the Greater Horn of Africa region as they struggled to establish democracy in the 1990 s, discuss the theoretical and policy implications of the study, venture some assumptions about the future prospects of democratization in the region and suggest some directions for future research. The importance of this work is twofold. First by examining how struggles to establish democracy evolved in the Greater Horn of Africa region in the 1990 s, the study contributes to the debates about the nature and extent of contemporary political changes in African countries. Second, the understanding that the variable of political leadership is crucial for accounting how processes of democratization evolve has potential importance for policy - particularly the current policy practised by Western democracies, transnational organizations and international networks to promote democracy abroad. The abiding lesson for such “promoters of democracy” is that when prompted from abroad, strides to democracy can only be made if political leadership in favour of democratization emerges locally.
