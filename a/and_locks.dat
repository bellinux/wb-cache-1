5|$|Below Winsford, {{the course}} of the river has been altered several times, by the {{construction}} of cuts <b>and</b> <b>locks,</b> to enable small ships to trade on it. The river formerly joined the River Mersey at Weston Marsh, but since the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal, begun in 1887, it has flowed into the canal, from where surplus water enters the Mersey by the Weaver sluices, just upstream of the junction. The tidal river section below Frodsham has been bypassed by the Weston Canal since 1810, and is no longer navigable, as Frodsham Lock is derelict.|$|E

50|$|Several {{scenarios}} were {{suggested in}} the inquiry. One such suggestion was an engine failure, however after {{an investigation of the}} power plants and the propeller governors, this idea was eliminated. It was also suggested that the landing gear may have been operated incorrectly, however the inquiry established that the nose wheel and starboard undercarriage were up <b>and</b> <b>locked,</b> <b>and</b> whilst they could not definitely prove that the port undercarriage was up <b>and</b> <b>locked,</b> the board decided that it was likely up <b>and</b> <b>locked.</b>|$|R

5|$|In April 1849, the Ipswich Express and Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper {{reported}} on a case in a village near to Rayleigh in which a girl had been afflicted with fits. Her family believed that a witch was to blame, with Murrell being called in to free her of the perceived bewitchment. He commissioned the local blacksmith to create an iron witch bottle, into which he placed toe-nail clippings <b>and</b> <b>locks</b> of hair belonging to the putative victim. The bottle was then placed into the hearth and heated until it exploded, with this supposedly defeating the witch's machinations.|$|E

5|$|In {{some parts}} of the world (mainly Africa and South America), large ants, {{especially}} army ants, are used as surgical sutures. The wound is pressed together and ants are applied along it. The ant seizes the edges of the wound in its mandibles <b>and</b> <b>locks</b> in place. The body is then cut off and the head and mandibles remain in place to close the wound. The large heads of the dinergates (soldiers) of the leafcutting ant Atta cephalotes are also used by native surgeons in closing wounds.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built four dams <b>and</b> <b>locks</b> on {{the lower}} Snake River to {{facilitate}} shipping. The lower Columbia River has likewise been dammed for navigation. Thus a deep shipping channel through locks and slackwater reservoirs for heavy barges exists from the Pacific Ocean to Lewiston, Idaho. Most barge traffic originating on the Snake River goes to deep-water ports {{on the lower}} Columbia River, such as Portland. Grain, mostly wheat, is the main product shipped from the Snake, and nearly {{all of it is}} exported internationally from the lower Columbia River ports.|$|E

5|$|It {{is clear}} that John has an ulterior motive; first, he paralyses Gwen <b>and</b> <b>locks</b> her in a crate telling {{her that if she}} is not found in two hours, her main organs will stop working and she would die.

Jack throws the device over the building, and John pushes him off the roof in retaliation.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Alberta, Canada, a downed {{spacecraft}} {{is being}} excavated {{under the direction}} of Josepho, the leader of a UFO religion. At the FBI, Doggett breaks into Skinner's office and steals the rubbings, along with an FBI personnel file belonging to Agent Robert Comer, the motorcyclist. Reyes reveals that Comer's rubbings do not match those from Africa, suggesting the existence of a second craft. Meanwhile, Comer goes to Scully's apartment, overpowers Margaret Scully (Sheila Larken) <b>and</b> <b>locks</b> himself in William's room. Scully arrives and, after a struggle, is forced to shoot Comer when he tries to smother the baby.|$|E
