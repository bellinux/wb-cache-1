40|$|The {{effect of}} oxygen on the {{degradation}} of sedimentary organic matter has been determined for 6 subtidal stations and 3 intertidal stations in the North Sea area. The stations were selected to cover a range of organic matter lability and sediment texture (and hence concentrations of organic matter). Slurry incubations revealed that at low mineralisation rates, <b>aerobic</b> <b>mineralisation</b> is significantly faster than anaerobic mineralisation, irrespective of the degree of lability of organic matter. A complementary incubation experiment with sediment rich in organic carbon mixed with varying proportions of organically poor sediments confirmed the enhanced <b>aerobic</b> <b>mineralisation</b> at low mineralisation levels. It is proposed that oxygen-enhanced degradation occurs at low mineralisation levels at which bacterial biomass production becomes limiting.

30|$|Available DT 50 {{values for}} the water phase in many cases only refer to dissipation, as many substances, {{especially}} those with high log KOC and low water solubility, are quickly transferred to the sediment. The <b>Aerobic</b> <b>Mineralisation</b> in Surface Water – Simulation Biodegradation Test (OECD 309 [18]) is available to measure degradation in the water phase, but to date it has rarely been used {{for the assessment of}} environmental fate.|$|E
40|$|A simple, steady state, reaction-diffusion {{diagenesis}} {{model is}} used to quantify the possible error associated with benthic flux measurements which neglect {{the presence of the}} diffusive boundary layer (DBL). Model application is restricted to non-bioturbated, fine-grained sediments in which oxygen consumption is dominated (~ 65 % of the consumption budget) by organic carbon degradation, oxygen penetration depths are low (< 0. 5 cm) and solute exchange across the sediment-water interface (SWI) is diffusive. The effect of different thicknesses of the DBL is tested on sediments with different organic carbon reactivities (k = 1, 5, 10, 20, 40 yr– 1). When imposing the range of DBL thicknesses observed in nature (0. 01 to 0. 1 cm) on the model, the model simulates lower oxygen fluxes (by up to 22 % for k = 40 yr– 1) across the SWI compared to fluxes simulated {{in the absence of a}} DBL. Greater reactivity increases the impact of the DBL by lowering the oxygen penetration depth. Changes in the DBL directly influence oxygen fluxes and <b>aerobic</b> <b>mineralisation</b> by changing the diffusion path length to a relatively thin oxic sediment layer. The changes in anaerobic processes are small (< 8 % for denitrification and < 3 % for sulphate reduction) and, together with the associated solute fluxes (nitrate, sulphate, ammonium) across the SWI, occur in response to changes in porewater oxygen concentrations induced by the DBL, rather than by direct interactions with the DBL. Changes included a 380 % increase in nitrate influxes and a 90 % reduction in nitrate effluxes. Rates of nitrification decreased by up to 18 %. Thicker DBLs also decreased the organic carbon degradation rate by a maximum of 22 %, implicating the DBL as a factor in organic carbon preservation for highly reactive sediments. Measurements of near-bed currents in a macro-tidal estuary (Southampton Water, UK) suggest that the observed range in DBL thicknesses can exist for up to 31 % of the time (sampling period: 3 to 4 mo). The presence of these DBL thicknesses in such a dynamic environment, makes it is reasonable to assume that the establishment of the DBL may be widespread. Consequently, it is only reasonable to neglect the DBL over sediments in which <b>aerobic</b> <b>mineralisation</b> is dominant, when organic reactivity is low...|$|E
40|$|Oxygen {{respiration}} {{rates of}} benthic foraminifera are still badly known, mainly {{because they are}} difficult to measure. Oxygen respiration rates of seventeen species of benthic foraminifera were measured using microelectrodes and calculated {{on the basis of}} the oxygen fluxes measured in the vicinity of the foraminiferal specimens. The results show a wide range of oxygen respiration rates for the different species (from 0. 09 to 5. 27 nl cell− 1 h− 1) and a clear correlation with foraminiferal biovolume showed by the power law relationship: R = 3. 98 10 − 3 BioVol 0. 88 where the oxygen respiration rate (R) is expressed in nl O 2 h− 1 and in μm 3 biovolume (BioVol) (n = 44, R 2 = 0. 72, F = 114, p < 0. 0001). The results expressed per biovolume unit (1. 82 to 15. 7 nl O 2 10 − 8 μm− 3 h− 1) allow us to compare our data with the previous published data showing similar ranges. A comparison with available data for other microbenthos groups (nematodes, copepods, ostracods, ciliates and flagellates) suggests that benthic foraminifera have a lower oxygen respiration rates per unit biovolume. The total contribution of benthic foraminifera to the <b>aerobic</b> <b>mineralisation</b> of organic matter is estimated for the studied areas. The results suggest that benthic foraminifera play only a minor role (0. 5 to 2. 5 %) in continental shelf environments, which strongly contrasts with their strong contribution to anaerobic organic matter mineralisation, by denitrification, in the same areas...|$|E
40|$|Palsa peats {{are unique}} {{northern}} ecosystems formed under an arctic climate and {{characterized by a}} high biodiversity and sensitive ecology. The stability of the palsas are seriously threatened by climate warming which will change the permafrost dynamic and induce a degradation of the mires. We used stable carbon isotope depth profiles in two palsa mires of Northern Sweden to track environmental change during {{the formation of the}} mires. Soils dominated by aerobic degradation can be expected to have a clear increase of carbon isotopes (&delta; 13 C) with depth, due to preferential release of 12 C during aerobic mineralization. In soils with suppressed degradation due to anoxic conditions, stable carbon isotope depth profiles are either more or less uniform indicating no or very low degradation or depth profiles turn to lighter values due to an enrichment of recalcitrant organic substances during anaerobic mineralisation which are depleted in 13 C. The isotope depth profile of the peat in the water saturated depressions (hollows) at the yet undisturbed mire Storflaket indicated very low to no degradation but increased rates of anaerobic degradation at the Stordalen site. The latter might be induced by degradation of the permafrost cores in the uplifted areas (hummocks) and subsequent breaking and submerging of the hummock peat into the hollows due to climate warming. Carbon isotope depth profiles of hummocks indicated a turn from <b>aerobic</b> <b>mineralisation</b> to anaerobic degradation at a peat depth between 4 and 25 cm. The age of these turning points was 14 C dated between 150 and 670 yr and could thus not be caused by anthropogenically induced climate change. We found the uplifting of the hummocks due to permafrost heave the most likely explanation for our findings. We thus concluded that differences in carbon isotope profiles of the hollows might point to the disturbance of the mires due to climate warming or due to differences in hydrology. The characteristic profiles of the hummocks are indicators for micro-geomorphic change during permafrost up heaving...|$|E
40|$|<b>Aerobic</b> <b>mineralisation</b> of C-org in surface sediments of {{the deep}} (> 2000 m water depth) eastern Mediterranean Sea has been {{quantified}} by analysis of detailed box core Corg concentration versus depth profiles and the modelling environment for early diagenetic problems MEDIA. The reactive fraction comprises 60 - 80 % of the total Corg reaching the sediments and is largely oxidised within the surficial 10 cm. A non-reactive Corg fraction (G(NR)) dominates at depths > 10 cm, and makes up 20 - 40 % of the total Corg flux to the sediments. First-order rate constants for decomposition of the reactive fraction calculated from the Corg profiles range from 5. 4 x 10 (- 3) to 8. 0 x 10 (- 3) y(- 1) to 8. 0 x 10 (- 3) y(- 1). Total mineralization rates in the surface sediment are between 1. 7 and 2. 6 mumol C cm(- 2) y(- 1) and thus are typical for oligotrophic, deep-sea environments. The low fluxes and rapid remineralisation of C-org are accompanied by 210 Pb(excess) surface mixed layers which are only 2 cm deep, among the thinnest reported for oxygenated marine sediments. Model results indicate a mismatch between the Corg profiles and O- 2 microprofiles which were measured onboard ship. This {{can be attributed to}} a combination of decompression artefacts affecting onboard measurement of the O 2 profiles or the leakage of oxygen into the core during handling on deck. Furthermore, the used D-b values, based on 210 (Pb), may not be fully appropriate; calculations with higher D-b values improve the O- 2 fits. The surficial sediment delta(13) C(org) values of - 22 degrees become less negative with increasing depth and decreasing C-org concentrations. The major delta(13) C change occurs in the top 3 to 4 cm and coincides with the interval were most of the organic carbon oxidation takes place. This indicates that the reactive fraction of organic matter, commonly assumed to be marine, has a more negative d 13 Corg than the refractory fraction, usually held to be terrestrial. Palaeoproductivity estimates calculated from the sediment data by means of literature algorithms yield low surface productivities (12 - 88 gC m(- 2) y(- 1)), which are in good agreement with field measurements of primary productivity in other studies. Such values are, however, significantly lower than those indicated by recent productivity maps of the area derived from satellite imagery (> 100 gC m(- 2) y(- 1)) ...|$|E
30|$|PBT/vPvB {{assessment}} became {{legally binding}} {{with the release}} of REACH [23], which laid down the persistence criteria from the TGD [26] plus a half-life in soil of 120  days, which is shorter than in the international agreements. Again, the relevant temperature (and other environmental conditions) for testing persistence was not defined in the regulation. In the first version of the Guidance in Information and Chemical Safety Assessment Chapter R. 11 [12], nothing is said on the relevant temperature for persistence testing. In version 2.0 of the Guidance Chapter R. 11 [15], one sentence relates to temperature: “Please note that since its 32 nd meeting the Member State Committee has started to require new simulation degradation studies to be carried out around neutral pH values and at 12  °C, which is understood as the mean temperature of European surface waters”. The draft version 4.0 of the Guidance Chapter R. 7 b Endpoint specific guidance [16] states that “New simulation studies should be conducted at environmentally relevant temperatures namely at 12  °C as this is seen as the average surface water temperature for the European Union (9  °C for sea water). If information on degradation half-life is already available from existing simulation degradation tests performed at a higher temperature, they should be normalised to a half-life corresponding to 12  °C by using the Arrhenius equation”. A generic activation energy of 65.4  kJ mol− 1 is proposed which has been derived by EFSA [19] (see below). The draft version 3.0 of the Guidance Chapter R. 11 PBT/vPvB assessment [17] refers to this statement. Simulation degradation studies should be performed according to the OECD guidelines no. 307 for aerobic degradation in soil [37], no. 308 for anaerobic and aerobic transformation in water and sediment [38] and no. 309 for <b>aerobic</b> <b>mineralisation</b> in surface water [39]. However, Honti and Fenner [30] concluded that available OECD 308 data are insufficient to derive persistence indicators that had both acceptable robustness and uncertainty. Rauert et al. [42] proposed “…normalising DegT 50 values to 12  °C because this temperature is established or suggested under the majority of frameworks (i.e. Biocides Regulation, REACH and medicinal products Directives)”. However, the guidance for PBT/vPvB assessment is the same for the three mentioned frameworks. For PPP, DG [10] stated in its Working Document on “Evidence needed to identify POP, PBT and vPvB Properties for Pesticides”: “Laboratory studies: DT 50 values should be normalised to a temperature of 20  °C, as this is the current practice in recent assessments of soil degradation rates of active substances”. This Working Document has been applied for the initial establishment of the list of candidates for substitution [11] as required in Article 80 [7] of Regulation (EC) No 1107 / 2009 [24], i.e. half-lives at 20  °C have been considered when the list was compiled.|$|E
