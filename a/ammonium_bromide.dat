The polar nature of the hydroxyl group causes ethanol to dissolve many ionic compounds, notably sodium and potassium hydroxides, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, ammonium chloride, <b>ammonium</b> <b>bromide,</b> and sodium bromide. Sodium and potassium chlorides are slightly soluble in ethanol. Because the ethanol molecule also has a nonpolar end, it will also dissolve nonpolar substances, including most essential oils and numerous flavoring, coloring, and medicinal agents.|$|E

Using a combination of single and dual source aerosol assisted chemical vapour deposition and analysis using scanning electron microscopy, we will present a range of morphologies, including plates with rough edges, plates with well-defined hexagonal structures, and organised stacks growing perpendicular to the substrate.

Special concern {{was devoted to}} study ion specific effects on KL from monovalent cations and anions belonging to the so-called Hofmeister or lyotropic series. Thus, in the study the stability of KL solutions containing different inorganic and organic anions as well as various quaternary <b>ammonium</b> <b>bromides</b> were tested.

The influence of various tetraalkyl <b>ammonium</b> <b>bromides</b> was compared with the effects of different alkali metal bromides. As the length of the alkyl chain was increased the KL stability was found to be decreasing.

40|$|The {{application}} of {{quantitative structure activity relationships}} to phase transfer catalysis (PTC) has been explored. The primary {{focus was on}} hydroxide-initiated PTC reactions, such as enolate alkylations. The tandem [4 + 2]/[3 + 2] cycloaddition of nitroalkenes was applied as the key transformation in the preparation of enantioenriched, tricyclic 1 -hydroxy-cyclopentapyrrolizidine ring systems. A three-step parallel synthesis procedure was developed to prepare libraries of quaternary ammonium ions sharing a common core scaffold. In total, 80 quaternary <b>ammonium</b> <b>bromides</b> were prepared in this way. A kinetic method for the analysis of liquid-liquid PTC reactions was refined. The kinetic profile for an enolate alkylation reaction was determined for 102 different quaternary <b>ammonium</b> <b>bromides</b> catalysts under a standard set of conditions. The data ranges over three orders of magnitude in catalyst activity. QSAR models were developed to describe the activity of the catalysts. Three types of models were considered: (1) linear combinations (2) parabolic combinations, and (3) bilinear combinations. The models that best account fit the catalyst activity data and retain the smallest number of descriptors included parabolic or binlinear contributions from logP and XSA (XSA = cross-sectional area). Analysis of the model {{in the context of an}} interfacial mechanism led the hypothesis that the largest differences in catalyst activities were due to the sum of the interfacial adsorption and desorption rate constants. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the rate constants for the stoichiometric alkylation of quaternary ammonium phenoxides to the catalytic rate constants for a series of Td symmetric homologous. It is suggested that the hypothesis could be tested further by measuring the surface activity of the catalysts at the interface of a water-organic biphasic mixture...|$|R

The continuous increase in the cloud point (CP) of drug by increase in inorganic salt concentration and the magnitude of increases rely upon the position of the salts in Hofmeister series and hydrated radii. The QABs also influence continuous increase in the CP, which is illustrated in terms of the alkyl chain length of peculiar QAB. The effect of amino acids on CP of the drug solution is dependent upon the characteristics (acidic, basic, polar or nonpolar) of particular amino acids.

40|$|Eight bolaform amphiphiles were {{synthesised}} and characterised; 4 α,ω-hydroxy-alkane trialkyl (and pyridyl) <b>ammonium</b> <b>bromides</b> and 4 α,ω-carboxy-alkane trialkyl (and pyridyl) <b>ammonium</b> <b>bromides</b> {{where the}} alkyl groups were methyl, ethyl and propyl. Four of these represented new compounds. Overall the Krafft temperatures (TK) {{of the eight}} amphiphiles were high, with 6 of the eight possessing TKs greater than 45 °C. Thus most of the amphiphiles could only expect to find applications at raised temperatures limiting their potential utility. However {{in addition to the}} previously reported α,ω-hydroxy-hexadecyl triethylammonium bromide (2 b) with a TK of 19. 1 °C, another amphiphile, α,ω-carboxy-hexadecyl tripropylammonium bromide (2 c) has been identified with a TK near ambient temperatures (TK of 22. 1 °C). This provides an acid functional ammonium bolaform amphiphile that micellises at ambient temperatures to complement the hydroxyl derivative. A correlation between TK and the product of the enthalpies and Tms of the compounds was observed for 7 of the eight compounds. No correlation between the amphiphile critical micelle concentrations (cmc) and TKs was observed confirming previous reports that TK values are predominantly determined by crystalline stability rather than solubility. Considerable differences were observed between the various amphiphile TKs at different pHs but no clear trend was apparent for the various compounds (despite {{the degree to which the}} compounds’ carboxylic acid and hydroxyl functionalities were likely to be ionised). The cmcs for the amphiphiles were an order of magnitude larger than those for analogous mono-ammonium amphiphiles with little difference in between the hydroxyl- and carboxy-functionalised compounds. The aggregation numbers (Nagg) obtained for all compounds were very low (Nagg < 7) and the apparent micellar diameters for the hydroxyl-bolaforms were in the range 1. 0 – 1. 4 nm whereas those for the carboxy-compounds were in the range 2. 1 – 2. 4 nm. These results strongly suggest a difference in the packing of the two sets of amphiphiles with loose low density aggregates or ‘molecular clusters’ for the carboxy compounds and denser classical micellar type aggregates for the hydroxyl-compounds. In both cases however the sizes and the low aggregation numbers point suggest that these aggregates are more characteristic of the pre-micellar aggregates observed for many amphiphiles but in particular gemini surfactants...|$|R

The ion abundance of the dimer grows relative to that of the molecular ion, M(+), with increasing analyte concentration in LSIMS until a concentration is reached where the ion abundance ratio M(2) Br(+) /M(+) remains constant upon subsequent analyte addition, The relationship between the M(2) Br(+) /M(+) ion abundance ratio and analyte concentration can be explained in terms of the solution equilibrium between these species, where the plateau region of the plot corresponds to the presence of an analyte monolayer at the liquid surface. The M(2) Br(+) /M(+) values obtained in this region provide relative dimer bond strengths for the alkyl quaternary ammonium salts, so the effect of different substituents on dimer stability can be assessed. Using this method, the importance of the electrostatic interaction on the dimer strength and the destabilizing effect of the hydrophobic interaction between long alkyl chains is revealed...|$|R
