If they are in formation under the orders of a commander, only the commander salutes; otherwise, all service personnel salute. Saluting is unnecessary if service personnel are indoors when a flag raising or lowering ceremony takes place.

The capacity expansion at Norfolk International Terminal, the 20-year lease of the APTM Virginia terminal facilities at Portsmouth and the planning and initial stages of the Craney Island terminal project all are complimentary to what others <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>and</b> how various investments are being made in transportation infrastructure improvements. Other entities doing so include the U.S. federal government, other Virginia agencies, other states and their respective local agencies (i.e. Toledo), corporate entities (notably the two Class 1 railroads and several short line railroads operating in the Hampton Roads region. VPA is even apparently ready to capitalize on developments initiated in other countries, with a particular emphasis on Panama's canal widening project.|$|E

500|$|To ensure {{accuracy}} in scriptwriting, the serial employs {{a team of}} researchers to advise writers on nursing issues and health service politics. One medical advisor was given a cameo role in the series as an orthopaedic surgeon, and another, recovery nurse Rachel Carter, appears in Holby City as a scrub nurse. Another adviser, a heart surgeon, has occasionally left open-heart surgery to advise Holby City writers over the telephone. The programme utilises surgeons from different disciplines, who check scripts for accuracy. Carter believes this is particularly important in case viewers copy procedures they have seen in the show, such as CPR. Series star Amanda Mealing commented: [...] "We pride ourselves on being realistic. You need to know what you <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>and</b> why. It is a complex and foreign thing to act out an operation. For training, I watched a number of real ones." [...] Cast members are taught how to give realistic injections, monitor blood pressure and check a pulse, and some are given the opportunity to observe procedures in real hospitals. Original cast member George Irving observed coronary artery bypass surgery performed at Papworth and Middlesex Hospital in preparation for his role as Anton Meyer, while Edward MacLiam observed laparoscopic surgery being performed before joining the cast as Greg Douglas in series twelve.|$|E
500|$|Propaganda and {{censorship}} {{were closely}} linked during the war. The {{need to maintain}} morale and counter German propaganda was recognised early in {{the war and the}} War Propaganda Bureau was established under the leadership of Charles Masterman in [...] The Bureau enlisted eminent writers such as H G Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle, Rudyard Kipling as well as newspaper editors. [...] Until its abolition in 1917, the department published 300 books and pamphlets in 21 languages, distributed over 4,000 propaganda photographs every week, and circulated maps, cartoons, and lantern slides to the media. [...] Masterman also commissioned films about the war such as The Battle of the Somme, which appeared in , while the battle was still in progress as a morale-booster and in general it met with a favourable reception. The Times reported on [...] 1916 that [...] "Crowded audiences... were interested and thrilled to have the realities of war brought so vividly before them, and if women had sometimes to shut their eyes to escape for a moment from the tragedy of the toll of battle which the film presents, opinion seems to be general that it was wise that the people at home should have this glimpse of what our soldiers <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>and</b> daring and suffering in Picardy".|$|E

[...] Additionally, PAs can aid in the formulation of job criteria and selection of individuals [...] "who are best suited to perform the required organizational tasks". [...] A PA can be part of guiding and monitoring employee career development. [...] PAs can also be used to aid in work motivation through the use of reward systems.|$|E
2500|$|The album's lyrics, {{written by}} both Accardi and Lacey, are more {{abstract}} compared {{to many of}} those featured on previous album, The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me. While Accardi had previously had some involvement in writing lyrics, Daisy saw him contribute far more compared to previous albums. Accardi and Lacey both affirmed {{that there had been}} no conscious decision made by the band on Accardi writing more. Lacey worked with Accardi to help refine his lyrics, as well as filling in any blanks. During writing, both Lacey and Accardi had unintentionally begun to reuse certain themes and imagery, such as nature and forests, as well as lyrics relating to an absence of love. Lacey also used his writing as a means of venting anxieties, comparing it to therapy proclaiming [...] "Daisy was just the venting of anxiety, of letting go and doing the right thing for us personally and as a band. It’s a very hard way to do something but it is the best way. There’s a lot of pent up emotion that goes into owning up to who you are, what you <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>and</b> the choices you are making so Daisy was us rejoicing in that".|$|E

2500|$|According to Robert Hare, {{one of the}} psychologists {{consulted}} by the FBI about Harris and Klebold, {{the media}} focused on the hatred exhibited by Harris' journal and web site, and interpreted this as {{an indication that the}} killings were motivated by revenge. Hare says, [...] "Unlike psychotic individuals, psychopaths are rational and aware of what they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>and</b> why. Their behavior is the result of choice, freely exercised." [...] In analyzing the pages of enraged writings in Harris' journals, Hare concludes the writings are not an expression of anger stemming from being ostracized or bullied, but are indicative of a deep superiority complex that seeks to punish the entire human race for its inferiority. Says Hare, [...] "It's more about demeaning other people." [...] According to Supervisory Special Agent Dwayne Fuselier, the FBI's lead Columbine investigator and a clinical psychologist, Harris exhibited a pattern of grandiosity, contempt, and lack of empathy or remorse, distinctive traits of psychopaths that Harris concealed through deception. Fuselier adds that Harris engaged in mendacity not merely to protect himself, as Harris rationalized in his journal, but also for pleasure, as seen when Harris expressed his thoughts in his journal regarding how he and Klebold avoided prosecution for breaking into a van. Other leading psychiatrists concur that Harris was a psychopath.|$|E

[...] But this is not true. [...] It {{is very difficult to}} find in the land [...] cultivated fields that are not used for planting. [...] Only those sand fields or stone mountains that would require the investment of hard labour and great expense to make them good for planting remain uncultivated and that's because the Arabs do not like working too much in the present for a distant future. Therefore, {{it is very difficult to}} find good land for cattle. [...] And not only peasants, but also rich landowners, are not selling good land so easily...We who live abroad {{are accustomed to}} believing that the Arabs are all wild desert people who, like donkeys, neither see nor understand what is happening around them.
