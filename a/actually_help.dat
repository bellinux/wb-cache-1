5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} few {{antidepressants}} {{that does}} not cause sexual dysfunction. A range of studies demonstrate that bupropion not only produces fewer sexual side effects than other antidepressants, but can <b>actually</b> <b>help</b> to alleviate sexual dysfunction. According to a survey of psychiatrists, it is the drug of choice {{for the treatment of}} SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction, although this is not an indication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. There have also been a few studies suggesting that bupropion can improve sexual function in women who are not depressed, if they have hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD).|$|E
5|$|The {{provitamin}} A beta-carotene from carrots {{does not}} <b>actually</b> <b>help</b> {{people to see}} in the dark unless they suffer from a deficiency of vitamin A. This myth was propaganda used by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War to explain why their pilots had improved success during night air battles, but was actually used to disguise advances in radar technology and the use of red lights on instrument panels. Nevertheless, the consumption of carrots was advocated in Britain at the time as part of a Dig for Victory campaign. A radio programme called The Kitchen Front encouraged people to grow, store and use carrots in various novel ways, including making carrot jam and Woolton pie, named after the Lord Woolton, the Minister for Food. The British public during WWII generally believed that eating carrots would help them see better at night and in 1942 there was a 100,000 ton surplus of carrots from the extra production.|$|E

25|$|The {{opinions}} of the Talmudic rabbis are divided between those who seek {{the purpose of the}} mitzvot {{and those who do not}} question them. The latter argue that if the reason for each mitzvah could be determined, people might try to achieve what they see as the purpose of the mitzvah, without actually performing the mitzvah itself (lishmah), which would become self-defeating. The former believe that if people were to understand the reason and the purpose for each mitzvah, it would <b>actually</b> <b>help</b> them to observe and perform the mitzvah (some mitzvot are given reasons in the Torah).|$|E
25|$|Nintendo officially {{unveiled}} the 2DS on August 28, 2013 via a press release; {{members of the}} press were given a chance to demo the device in private prior to the announcement. According to Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé, the Nintendo 2DS is primarily aimed at a younger demographic than the Nintendo 3DS — particularly, those younger than 7 years old; whom Nintendo had advised not to use the 3D features on the 3DS due to potential eye health concerns. The validity of Nintendo's claims were questioned by vision experts, however, who believed that the 3DS could <b>actually</b> <b>help</b> detect certain eye problems, and felt the warnings were for liability reasons rather than any realistic harm.|$|E
25|$|Screening by {{hysteroscopy}} {{to obtain}} cell samples obtained for histological examination is being developed. This {{is similar to}} the current pap smear that is used to detect cervical cancer. The UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening is testing a screening technique that combines CA-125 blood tests with transvaginal ultrasound. Other studies suggest that this screening procedure may be effective. However, it's not yet clear if this approach could <b>actually</b> <b>help</b> to save lives—the full results of the trial will be published in 2015. One major problem with screening is no clear progression of the disease from stage I (noninvasive) to stage III (invasive) is seen, and it may not be possible to find cancers before they reach stage III. Another problem is that screening methods tend to find too many suspicious lesions, most of which are not cancer, but malignancy can only be assessed with surgery. The ROCA method combined with transvaginal ultrasonography is being researched in high-risk women to determine if it is a viable screening method. It is also being investigated in normal-risk women as it has shown promise in the wider population. Studies are also in progress to determine if screening helps detect cancer earlier in people with BRCA mutations.|$|E

[...] He introduces to a wider audience the influential concept he presented in 1977 that the phenotypic effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism's body, but can stretch far into the environment, including the bodies of other organisms. Dawkins regarded the extended phenotype as his single most important contribution to evolutionary biology and he considered niche construction to be a special case of extended phenotype. The concept of extended phenotype helps explain evolution, {{but it does not}} <b>actually</b> <b>help</b> predict specific outcomes.|$|E

500|$|The gold panic {{devastated the}} United States economy for months.

Gould had earlier claimed to Grant that raising the price of gold would <b>actually</b> <b>help</b> farmers. [...] Also Fisk refused to pay off many of his investors who had bought gold on paper. The volume of stocks being sold on Wall Street {{decreased}} by 20%. Fisk and Gould, who could afford to hire the best lawyers, were never held accountable for their profiteering, as favorable judges declined to prosecute. Gould remained a powerful force on Wall Street for the next 20 years. Fisk, who practiced a licentious lifestyle, was killed by a jealous rival on January 6, 1872. Butterfield later resigned.|$|E

[...] Douglas Holtz-Eakin, CBO director during the George W.

500|$|The episode {{features}} a fictional education film called Lava and You, which says lava will pass harmlessly over potential victims who duck and cover their heads. The film {{was inspired by}} actual [...] "Duck and Cover" [...] films from the 1950s and 1960s, in which children were instructed to hide under tables or lean against walls {{in the case of}} a nuclear weapon attack; Parker and Stone, like many critics of the films, found the methods painfully simplistic and did not believe they would <b>actually</b> <b>help</b> in the case of such an attack. Jimbo and Ned are described as veterans of the Vietnam War, the military conflict between North Vietnam and South Vietnam that lasted from 1959 to 1975; Cartman, who is far too young to have participated in the war, claims to have flashbacks to his experiences in it. Patrick Duffy, the American television actor best known for his roles in the shows Dallas and Step by Step, appears in the episode as the living leg of Scuzzlebutt. Matt Stone claimed there was no particular reason Duffy was chosen as the leg except that he is such a nondescript actor: [...] "He's just super bland. Like, how could you possibly be a fan of Patrick Duffy?" ...|$|E

In March 2013, Whedon expanded on his consulting responsibilities, saying, [...] "I understand what Kevin [...] is going for and where he's heading, and I read the scripts and watch cuts {{and talk to the}} directors and writers and give my opinion. Occasionally there could be some writing. But I'm not trying to get in anybody's soup, I'm just trying to be helpful." [...] Whedon later elaborated that [...] "Since the story has already been approved and everybody knows what we're doing with Avengers 2, we can really lay it out. It's not like anyone's saying [...] "well I don't know, what if I need that?" [...] It's like [...] "doing this is troublesome for us, whereas doing this will <b>actually</b> <b>help</b> us." ... You want to honor {{the events of the last}} movie but you don't want to be beholden to them, because some people will see Avengers who did not see any of the movies in between or even Avengers 1." [...] He also found working in television and script doctoring to be [...] "great training ground for dealing with this ... because you're given a bunch of pieces and told to make them fit—even if they don't." ...|$|E

Whitney is left alone and vulnerable, and falls for a man, Rob Grayson, played by Jody Latham, who exploits her for financial gain. EastEnders worked alongside charity Comic Relief on the storyline, which started planning in 2010. The storyline culminated during Red Nose Day 2011 on 19 March 2011, in a special ten-minute episode. Gilly Green, Head of UK Grants at Comic Relief, said: [...] "It is vital that we continue to alert young people to the dangers if we are to stop them being exploited and the opportunity to work with EastEnders will make a huge audience aware of this issue. We have been working with the EastEnders script writers and some of the young women from projects we support to ensure the story reflects the reality of young people caught up in sexual exploitation." [...] Kevin Cahill, Chief Executive of Comic Relief, added [...] "We have worked over many years with EastEnders in all kinds of ways. It's been a real pleasure this year to work together on a piece of serious drama, in the best traditions of public service, which will highlight an important issue and also, because it occurs on the night of Comic Relief, <b>actually</b> <b>help</b> raise crucial funds to help young women caught up in it." [...] The storyline begins when Bianca is sent to prison and Whitney rejects her family, moving in with Janine and attempting to make money by stealing from The Queen Victoria, causing her to get sacked, working for Max, whom she tries to kiss as she has a crush on him, and pickpocketing. When she is caught, Rob rescues her from the situation and offers her what McGarty called a [...] "dream life", which Whitney thinks is her chance to move up in the world as she feels lonely and has no friends.|$|E
500|$|That {{arrangement}} did {{not last}} long, and by February 1936, Briskin's role at the studio was changing. While still with the same title, {{he was no longer}} subservient to Kahane, having full control over all RKO production. In February 1936 Briskin was mentioned along with a handful of other producers as being in such demand that they could write their own ticket, the others mentioned included Thalberg, David O. Selznick, Darryl F. Zanuck, Hunt Stromberg, and Sol Wurtzel. By April of that year, Briskin was putting his mark on RKO. He purchased quite a few properties, signed numerous actors, and lured successful producers to the studio, such as Edward Small. Later that year, RKO gained the rights to the successful Irish play, The Plough and the Stars, by playwright Seán O'Casey. This led to Briskin being responsible for bringing Barry Fitzgerald to Hollywood for his American film debut. Fitzgerald was one of four members of the play's original cast at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, who Briskin signed to appear in the film version of the same name. By the middle of the year, RKO was solidly Briskin's, with the full backing of studio head Leo Spitz, This led to Kahane, who had been with the studio since its inception, resigning in August, several months prior to the expiration of his contract, and heading to a vice-presidency at Columbia. For the upcoming 1936–37 production season, Briskin announced that he intended to have at least three star-caliber performers in each film. In September, Briskin was elected to the AMPAS board of governors, along with several others including Clark Gable, Darryl Zanuck, and Cecil B. DeMille. The following month, Briskin initiated a policy wherein the younger players under contract to RKO could appear in stage productions in stock and little theater companies for short periods, in order for the actors to gain experience. Also in October, Briskin was chosen to succeed Louis B. Mayer as chairman of the motion picture community chest. In 1936 Briskin led RKO to its most productive year up to that date. Before the end of the year, a new medium was being introduced, television. When asked about the threat this new entertainment source might pose to the film industry, Briskin thought that TV would <b>actually</b> <b>help</b> films. He felt that it might be the [...] "... greatest thing that could happen to the industry." [...] Rationalizing that [...] "... 10 years ago when radio broadcasting began many feared people would sit at home with earphones and listen to the free radio entertainment. Instead, the movies have had their best years since radio broadcasting came in ..." [...] In December, reports began to surface that he was up for a long term contract at RKO, however, due to an impending reorganization, he was only given a one-year extension, with a promise of a long-term deal once the reorganization was complete. Briskin made the decision to begin color films at RKO. He was also responsible for bringing the Poverty Row producer, Maury M. Cohen, into RKO.|$|E
