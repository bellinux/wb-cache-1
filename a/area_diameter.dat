2500|$|One way of quantitatively {{ensuring}} {{the health of}} indoor air is by the frequency of effective turnover of interior air by replacement with outside air. [...] In the UK, for example, classrooms are required to have 2.5 outdoor air changes per hour. [...] In halls, gym, dining, and physiotherapy spaces, the ventilation should be sufficient to limit carbon dioxide to 1,500 ppm. In the USA, and according to ASHRAE Standards, ventilation in classrooms {{is based on the}} amount of outdoor air per occupant plus the amount of outdoor air per unit of floor area, not air changes per hour. Since carbon dioxide indoors comes from occupants and outdoor air, the adequacy of ventilation per occupant is indicated by the concentration indoors minus the concentration outdoors. The value of 615 ppm above the outdoor concentration indicates approximately 15 cubic feet per minute of outdoor air per adult occupant doing sedentary office work where outdoor air contains 385 ppm, the current global average atmospheric CO2 concentration. In classrooms, the requirements in the ASHRAE standard 62.1, Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality, would typically result in about 3 air changes per hour, depending on the occupant density. Of course the occupants aren't the only source of pollutants, so outdoor air ventilation may need to be higher when unusual or strong sources of pollution exist indoors. When outdoor air is polluted, then bringing in more outdoor air can actually worsen the overall quality of the indoor air and exacerbate some occupant symptoms related to outdoor air pollution. Generally, outdoor country air is better than indoor city air. Exhaust gas leakages can occur from furnace metal exhaust pipes that lead to the chimney when there are leaks in the pipe and the pipe gas flow <b>area</b> <b>diameter</b> has been reduced.|$|E
50|$|The {{proposed}} Airport {{would provide}} transport infrastructure to pilgrims {{who wish to}} travel by air to Sabarimala, the second largest pilgrim center in India with annual pilgrims of around 60 Million (as per Government data for the year 2011). It is to note that Tirupathi have more revenue than Sabarimala just because that temple has an airport. VIPs like Ambani, Mallaya etc. visit in their own private jets and offer millions as donation there yearly. The airport site is an hour's drive away from the temple town and also close to other tourist destinations such as Kumarakom, most visited spot in Kerala, the backwaters of Alappuzha, Gavi, the Thekkady tiger reserve and untouched and unknown spots like Kuttikanam, Panchalimedu etc. The airport is expected to serve Central Travancore region, comprising parts of five districts in Kerala state namely Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Idukki and Kollam. Majority of the North American NRIs are from Pathanamthitta and Kottayam, while NRIs are far less in northern parts of Idukki and Alapuzha. Out of the foreign and domestic tourists' arrival to Kerala, these five districts together account for about 21 per cent of foreign tourists and 14 percent of domestic tourists.

Highest NRIs pockets like Guruvayoor and Chavakkad in Trissur district mostly prefer Kozhikode as both Kochi and Kozhikode are almost equal distance.
