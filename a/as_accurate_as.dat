5|$|Lloyd's Register is only <b>as</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>as</b> the {{information}} owners gave it, {{and there are}} discrepancies between the entries for vessels and information from other sources.

5|$|Although clepsydrae {{were more}} useful than sundials—they {{could be used}} indoors, during the night, and also when the sky was cloudy—they were not as {{accurate}}; the Greeks, therefore, sought a way to improve their water clocks. Although still not <b>as</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>as</b> sundials, Greek water clocks became more accurate around 325, and they were adapted to have a face with an hour hand, making {{the reading of the}} clock more precise and convenient. One of the more common problems in most types of clepsydrae was caused by water pressure: when the container holding the water was full, the increased pressure caused the water to flow more rapidly. This problem was addressed by Greek and Roman horologists beginning in 100, and improvements continued {{to be made in the}} following centuries. To counteract the increased water flow, the clock's water containers—usually bowls or jugs—were given a conical shape; positioned with the wide end up, a greater amount of water had to flow out in order to drop the same distance as when the water was lower in the cone. Along with this improvement, clocks were constructed more elegantly in this period, with hours marked by gongs, doors opening to miniature figurines, bells, or moving mechanisms. There were some remaining problems, however, which were never solved, such as the effect of temperature. Water flows more slowly when cold, or may even freeze.|$|E

25|$|The Mk. II also {{included}} a new transmitter, which had increased in power three times from 50 to 150kW. This extra power offered somewhat better range, but more importantly it allowed the pulse width to be significantly reduced while offering the same range. The sharpness of the echo {{is a function of}} the pulse width, so by reducing it the system became more accurate. The Mk. II could offer bearing measurements <b>as</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>as</b> ½ degree, about twice <b>as</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>as</b> the Mk. I*, and just within the range needed to directly aim the guns. The Mk. II had largely replaced the Mk. I* by mid-1942 and remained in service until 1943. An analysis demonstrated that the Mk. II improved the rounds-per-kill to 2,750, another significant advance. 1,679 GL Mark II sets were produced between June 1940 and August 1943.|$|E
25|$|To obtain <b>as</b> <b>accurate</b> {{assignments}} <b>as</b> possible it is a {{great advantage}} to have access to carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 NOESY experiments, since they help to resolve overlap in the proton dimension.

25|$|Although {{successful}} as a precision timekeeper, the Admiralty {{for obvious reasons}} wanted a timekeeper on every major ship, and Kendall's was too expensive and took too long to make. Kendall made a simplified version (K2) in 1771, leaving out the complicated remontoir system. But the result was still too costly and, moreover, not <b>as</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>as</b> the original.|$|E
25|$|This restaging {{should not}} be taken <b>as</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>as</b> there were major compromises made for {{television}} and because of the differences in crew experience, the fuel used, the modifications made to the replicas for modern safety rules, modern materials and construction methods, and following operating experience. Sensible comparisons were made between the engines only after calculations took into account the differences.|$|E
25|$|Lloyd's Register for 1808 still shows Admiral Colpoys with R. Cooly, master, King & Co., owners, {{and trade}} London-Africa. So does Lloyd's Register for 1809; {{it also shows}} a new master, Venables, {{replacing}} Cooly. However, Lloyd's Register was only <b>as</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>as</b> {{the owners of the}} vessels chose to make it by updating their information. It is therefore not clear whether Thomas King & Co. continued to trade slaves or not. Given that she retained her name and all subsequent merchant voyages had her sailing to British Guiana, she most probably did not.|$|E

25|$|Daniel Jackson's {{lecture on}} his {{theories}} was filmed {{in a hotel}} in Los Angeles. The scene was originally much longer and delved more into the theories that aliens had built the Egyptian pyramids, but the scene was trimmed for time concerns for the release. The scenes with O'Neil at his house were the first scenes filmed with Kurt Russell; his hair was cut short afterwards. Russell requested his hair color to be brightened a little for the film. The fictional facility housing the Stargate was the largest set for the film, located in Long Beach, California. Egyptologist Stuart Tyson Smith joined production to make all Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and spoken language <b>as</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>as</b> possible.|$|E
25|$|In {{directional}} terms, {{the beam}} was sharp {{enough that the}} edges of the arc were quite strong - the target would appear in the beam and then disappear with little or no difference in brightness at the edges. This meant that in spite of the relatively wide beam, the arcs were quite sharp and even small angles would cause the signals to disappear at some point and create a gap in the return. With targets near the centre this was quite easy to see as the ring would develop a gap, allowing measurements <b>as</b> <b>accurate</b> <b>as</b> about one degree. However, targets further from the centre displayed much shorter arcs, making it more difficult to see small changes in their length.|$|E
