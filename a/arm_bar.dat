25|$|Ken Shamrock Productions co-promoted {{an event}} with War Gods on February 13, 2009, in which Ken {{fought in the}} main event against 6'6, 380lb. Ross Clifton. Shamrock knocked Clifton down with a right hand and {{finished}} him via <b>arm</b> <b>bar</b> from side control in the first round. Shamrock was then scheduled to fight Bobby Lashley, but tested positive for steroids after the Clifton fight and received a one-year suspension. Shamrock's attorney and former manager Rod Donohoo said Shamrock adamantly denied the allegations.|$|E
2500|$|The opening {{match of}} the 83rd Anniversary Show was a best two-out-of-three falls six-woman [...] "Lucha Libre rules" [...] tag team match between the tecnica trio of Lluvia, Marcela and Princesa Sugehit and the ruda team of La Amapola, Dalys la Caribeña and Zeuxis. The first fall was {{won by the}} tecnica team when Princesa Sugehit forced La Amapola to submit to an <b>arm</b> <b>bar.</b> The ruda team evened the falls when La Amapola pinned Princesa Sugehit after {{executing}} a Devil's Wings (Lifting double underhook facebuster). During the third fall Lluvia appeares to be injured, although it was unclear {{if it was a}} legitimate injury or part of the script. In the end Daly pinned Marcela to win the third and final fall.|$|E

His most common winning kimarite was {{overwhelmingly}} yori-kiri, a straightforward force out, which accounted for over half of his victories at sekitori level.

40|$|We use a {{data set}} of nearby galaxies {{drawn from the}} HERACLES, ATLAS 3 D, and COLD GASS surveys to study {{variations}} in molecular gas depletion time (Tdep) in galaxy structures such as bulges, grand-design spiral <b>arms,</b> <b>bars</b> and rings. Molecular gas is traced by CO line emission and star formation rate (SFR) is derived using the combination of far-ultraviolet and mid-infrared (MIR) data. The contribution of old stars to MIR emission for the ATLAS 3 D sample is corrected using 2 MASS K-band images. We apply a two-dimensional image decomposition algorithm to decompose galaxies into bulges and discs. Spiral <b>arms,</b> <b>bars</b> and rings are identified in the residual maps, and molecular gas depletion times are derived on a square grid of 1 kpc^ 2 size. In previous work, we showed that Tdep correlates strongly with specific star formation rate (sSFR). We now find that at a given sSFR, the bulge has shorter Tdep than the disc. The shift to shorter depletion times is most pronounced in the inner bulge (R < 0. 1 Re). Grids from galaxies with bars and rings {{are similar to those}} from galactic bulges in that they have reduced Tdep at a given sSFR. In contrast, the Tdep versus sSFR relation in the discs of galaxies with spiral arms is displaced to longer Tdep at fixed sSFR. We then show that the differences in the Tdep-sSFR relation for bulges, discs, <b>arms,</b> <b>bars</b> and rings can be linked to variations in "stellar", rather than gas surface density between different structures. Our best current predictor for Tdep, both globally and for 1 kpc grids, is given by Tdep= - 0. 36 log(Sigma_SFR) - 0. 5 log(Sigma_*) + 5. 87.

50|$|Toyonoumi {{was one of}} the {{heaviest}} wrestlers ever, reaching a peak weight of around 225 kg in 1998, and was sometimes criticised for being ungainly and slow-moving. He favoured yotsu-sumo or grappling techniques. He used a hidari-yotsu position on his opponent's mawashi or belt, with a right hand outside, left hand inside grip. His two most common winning kimarite were yori-kiri (force out) and oshi-dashi (push out). Among other techniques he used regularly were kotenage (armlock throw) and kimedashi (<b>arm</b> <b>barring</b> force out).|$|R
