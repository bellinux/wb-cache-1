5|$|Blake {{arrived at}} St Helen's Pool in April 1651 and set <b>about</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> island of Tresco, attacking the harbour of Old Grimsby and the blockhouse. Blake {{deployed}} {{a force of}} men in small boats, but they landed on the wrong island {{and had to be}} recalled to the ships. The next day the men landed on the beaches below the blockhouse; fighting ensued and the attackers were driven back. Blake's men made another landing which also saw fierce resistance, and the guns of the blockhouse were probably turned on the landing parties. Around 15 of the assault force were killed, but the guns of Blake's ships guns had a longer range than those of the blockhouse and Old Grimsby fell. Blake went on to use Tresco as a basis for taking St Mary's.|$|E

5|$|Unlike both horror remakes, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) and The Amityville Horror (2005)which {{were also}} {{produced}} by Bay, Form, and Fullerit {{was decided that}} Friday the 13th {{would not be a}} period piece. Form and Fuller said the film was not strictly a remake so there was no reason they could not set the story in the 2000s. In October 2007, Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, the writers of Freddy vs. Jason, were hired to write a script for Friday the 13th. Jonathan Liebesman was in negotiations to direct the film, but scheduling conflicts meant he was unavailable and Fuller and Form chose Marcus Nispel. Nispel was apprehensive <b>about</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> job, mainly because he would be taking over another film franchise, but Fuller eventually persuaded him to direct the project. Principal photography began on April 21, 2008, in Austin, Texas, and finished on June 13, 2008.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} night, 24 March, a {{crowd of}} between 7–8,000 men assembled in North Quay, and into Queen and William Street, where speakers began talking <b>about</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> law into their own hands. As the anger amongst the crowd grew, a large group broke away from it and carrying a large Australian flag proceeded to cross Victoria Bridge singing patriotic songs. Assembling at Merivale Street they began to move towards the hall. Finding their way blocked by a force of between 40–60 police mounted on horseback and armed with rifles and bayonets, {{under the command of}} the police commissioner, Frederic Urquhart, a clash broke out in which over 100 men received bayonet wounds. The fighting lasted for two hours. In the end between 14 and 19 police officers were injured and three police horses were shot, one of which later died, while 19 of the injured ex-servicemen needed to be evacuated by ambulance.|$|E

At Gen Con 2012 in August, Mike Mearls, lead developer for 5th Edition, said that Wizards of the Coast had received feedback from more than 75,000 playtesters, but that the entire development process would take two years, adding, [...] "I can't emphasize this enough... we're very serious <b>about</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> time we need to get this right."

500|$|Erlandson {{said that}} early in Hole's career, {{they were more}} {{interested}} in [...] "making noise" [...] than achieving success and before drummer Caroline Rue joined the band that they used no percussion whatsoever. It was not until Love and Erlandson heard Mudhoney's [...] "Touch Me I'm Sick" [...] that they began to think <b>about</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> band to the next level. Early on, the band was most influenced by the New York No Wave art and music scene of the 1980s, which included visual artists, such as Richard Kern, as well as scuzz rock acts, such as Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, Sonic Youth, and Pussy Galore. The band also featured a third guitarist in its early days, first Mike Geisbrecht and then Errol Stewart. After the band's first four shows, the original lineup disbanded and Hole recruited bassist Jill Emery in 1990.|$|E
500|$|Evan Sawdey of PopMatters said, [...] "Of all the ballads, though, {{the quiet}} piano closer 'Glitter in the Air' takes the cake, never once overplaying its hand, {{remaining}} sweet without once ever succumbing to saccharine niceties (think of a Jason Robert Brown song without the vocal showboating). It's the sweetest {{moment on the}} entire disc, but it only succeeds because it's also the least complex song here". Craig Emonds of The South End stated that while [...] "every song has potential to do well and is quite likable, [...] Pink's vocals are strong and shine particularly in the ballad 'Glitter In The Air'." [...] Nekesa Mumbi Moodoy of the Associated Press said that [...] "What makes the song so moving is that despite all of the heartache, she doesn't appear gun-shy <b>about</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> leap again".|$|E

500|$|Though {{the actor}} enjoyed playing {{the part of}} Brainiac, Marsters did have an initial {{apprehension}} <b>about</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> role. As he is familiar with Brainiac from the comics, Marsters {{did not wish to}} be turned green and wear the character's traditional pink outfit. The actor had to do little research on his character, as Brainiac's original back story only consisted of a few comic book panels. Marsters believes his character wants {{to get rid of the}} humans because they are doing nothing but destroying their own planet, and Brainiac sees it as his duty to perform [...] "pest control" [...] on the species. The actor was going to appear in season six, but because his scheduled filled, the producers wanted to [...] "close the door" [...] on this storyline, so they [...] "killed" [...] his character. Later, Marsters was approached by Gough and Millar about returning to the show for its seventh season; this time Marsters had free time in his schedule, and was able to return for four episodes.|$|E
500|$|In 1968 Le Mesurier {{was offered}} a role in a new BBC {{situation}} comedy playing an upper-class Sergeant Arthur Wilson in Dad's Army, although he was the second choice after Robert Dorning. Le Mesurier was unsure <b>about</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> part as he was finishing the final series of George and the Dragon {{and did not want}} another long-term television role. He was persuaded both by an increase in his fee—to £26210s (£262.50) per episode—and by the casting of his old friend Clive Dunn as Corporal Jones. Le Mesurier was initially unsure of how to portray his character, and was advised by series writer Jimmy Perry to make the part his own. Le Mesurier decided to base the character on himself, later writing that [...] "I thought, why not just be myself, use an extension of my own personality and behave rather as I had done in the army? So I always left a button or two undone, and had the sleeve of my battle dress slightly turned up. I spoke softly, issued commands as if they were invitations (the sort not likely to be accepted) and generally assumed a benign air of helplessness". Perry later observed that [...] "we wanted Wilson to be the voice of sanity; he has become John".|$|E

[...] "They don’t have any dates but I’m thinking from the scuttlebutt I’m hearing that’s it, but I don’t know anything for sure other than they do have a script they love, they're still tweaking." [...] The film may also take place more in the real world than in the past according to the recent interview: [...] "That’s what I’m told, but you didn’t hear me say that," [...] Boxleitner joked. [...] "I think it’s {{going to be a lot}} <b>about</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> company back because if you remember Sam Flynn says to Alan at the end, just before he rides his bike off into the sunrise with Quorra, says, ‘We’re going to take the company back.’ That’s not the end of the movie. That’s the beginning of the next one. That’s foreshadowing. And you don’t get Cillian Murphy to do an unscripted cameo" [...] and [...] "I got a feeling Eddie Dillinger Jr.’s going to be as bad as his dad was." ...|$|E

500|$|Faust was {{initially}} hired by Hasbro {{to create a}} pitch bible for the show, allowing her to get additional help with conceptualization. Faust said she was [...] "extremely skeptical" [...] <b>about</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> job at first because she had always found shows based on girls' toys to be boring and unrelatable. My Little Pony {{was one of her}} favorite childhood toys, but she was disappointed that her imagination at the time was nothing like the animated shows, in which the characters, according to Faust, [...] "just had endless tea parties, giggled over nothing and defeated villains by either sharing with them or crying". With the chance to work on My Little Pony, she hoped to prove that [...] "cartoons for girls don't have to be a puddle of smooshy, cutesy-wootsy, goody-two-shoeness". To do this, she incorporated into the design of the characters and the show many elements that contradicted idealized stereotypes of girls, such as diverse personalities, the message that friends can be different and can get into arguments but still be friends, and the idea that girls should not be limited by what others say they can or cannot do. Elements of the characters' personalities and the show's settings were based on her own childhood imagination of the ponies' adventures, in part inspired by the animated shows that her brothers would watch while growing up, such as Transformers and she considered that she was making Friendship Is Magic [...] "for me as an eight-year-old". Faust still aimed for the characters to be [...] "relatable" [...] characters, using stereotypical [...] "icons of girliness" [...] (such as the waif or the bookworm) in order to broaden the appeal of the characters for the young female audience.|$|E
500|$|Former UCLA {{professor}} of information studies Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert argued that three articles in Wired News {{led to the}} creation of the widely spread urban legend that Gore claimed to have [...] "invented the Internet", which followed this interview. In addition, computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued in his defense. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that [...] "we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet." [...] Cerf would later state: [...] "Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So he really does deserve credit." [...] In a speech to the American Political Science Association, former Republican Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich also stated: [...] "In all fairness, it's something Gore had worked on a long time. Gore is not the Father of the Internet, but in all fairness, Gore is the person who, in the Congress, most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an Internet, and the truth is—and I worked with him starting in 1978 when I got , we were both part of a [...] "futures group"—the fact is, in the Clinton administration, the world we had talked about in the '80s began to actually happen." [...] Finally, Wolf Blitzer (who conducted the original 1999 interview) stated in 2008 that: [...] "I didn't ask him about the Internet. I asked him about the differences he had with Bill Bradley [...] Honestly, at the time, when he said it, it didn't dawn on me that this was going to have the impact that it wound up having, because it was distorted to a certain degree and people said they took what he said, which was a carefully phrased comment <b>about</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> initiative and creating the Internet to—I invented the Internet. And that was the sort of shorthand, the way his enemies projected it and it wound up being a devastating setback to him and it hurt him, as I'm sure he acknowledges to this very day." ...|$|E

His first line was a gift, a line of trenches [...] from the fort that had been prepared by the garrison of the fort and then for some reason abandoned. It was a little farther than he would have liked, but it served quite well. Additional parallels were built with little interference, as the laborers could work behind the sand dunes.|$|E

2500|$|Suzanne Rogers first {{auditioned for}} the role on July 13, 1973, and {{garnered}} the attention of future daytime legend, Susan Flannery, who played Dr. Laura Horton. Maggie was introduced as a guest character in August 1973, by scriptwriter William J. Bell and executive producer Betty Corday. From the beginning, Bell considered the role ideal for Suzanne Rogers, a former Rockette from the Radio City Music Hall and Broadway chorus girl in such musicals as [...] "Coco" [...] and [...] "Follies". Bell approached Rogers <b>about</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> role of Maggie, and she agreed. She was immediately described by critics who gave reviews of the show as {{being one of the}} most energetic girls on daytime television. The news of Suzanne Rogers being cast as Maggie was a different move, taking an actress who loves to dance, to a character of a crippled farm girl. This was her first television assignment, after being the youngest girl to take the stage at Radio City Music Hall.|$|E
