30|$|The {{scale and}} {{diversity}} of cyberattacks have changed significantly in recent years, becoming a critical means for monetary gain, intellectual theft, and political agenda worldwide. Recent reports show {{that the number of}} cyberattacks continues to rise globally (PwC 2016), and the cost to society due to these attacks is expanding at a tremendous rate (Accenture Security 2017). Forecasting cyberattacks before they take place can offer great value, but is challenging because of the limited relevance one could find from albeit significant volume of ever-changing and diverse ‘unconventional’ signals in social media, news, and other public forums. This paper tackles this challenge by developing an integrated system that treats the problems of <b>incomplete</b> <b>signals,</b> signals with varying significant lags, and imbalanced ground truth labels.|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} missing or {{incomplete}} information arises in many National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) processes. Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations provide some guidance on how to <b>address</b> <b>incomplete</b> information at 40 C. F. R. § 1502. 22, but this provision {{can be difficult to}} interpret and is frequently misapplied. Departmental and agency implementing regulations tend to provide little instructions regarding {{missing or incomplete}} information, and there is scant applicable case law. Federal agencies and NEPA practitioners are left with inadequate guidance on this difficult and often controversial issue. Uncertainty about how to <b>address</b> missing or <b>incomplete</b> information can weaken NEPA analyses, obfuscate important environmental issues and also undermine the legal defensibility of NEPA documents and the agency decisions they support. This paper proposes a systematic process for <b>addressing</b> <b>incomplete</b> information in Environmental Impact Statements developed pursuant to NEPA. This solution flows from careful interpretation of relevant provisions of NEPA and CEQ regulations, in particular CEQ regulations at 40 C. F. R. § 1502. 22. The product of this effort is a sequential process that is simple enough to illustrate in the form a flow chart, yet expansive enough to contemplate the full spectrum of missing or incomplete information that may be encountered in an EIS process. This approach was recently utilized in a high-profile EIS and received strong praise from the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ...|$|R
40|$|T cell {{reactivity}} to minor histocompatibility (mH) antigens {{is responsible}} for rejection of HLA-matched allografts, limiting the effectiveness of transplantation {{for the treatment of}} end-stage organ failure. The deadbox gene Dby is located on the Y chromosome and encodes an mH antigen that prompts rejection of male tissues by female mice. Establishing a network of regulatory T (T(reg)) cells that is capable of coercing naive cells to adopt a tolerant phenotype offers an attractive strategy for immune intervention in such deleterious immune responses. While various approaches have successfully induced a dominant form of transplantation tolerance, they share the propensity to provoke chronic, incomplete activation of T cells. By identifying the T cell receptor (TCR) contact sites of the dominant epitope of the Dby gene product, we have designed an altered peptide ligand (APL) that delivers <b>incomplete</b> <b>signals</b> to naive T cells from A 1 infinity RAG 1 (-/-) mice that are transgenic for a complementary TCR. Administration of this APL to female transgenic mice polarizes T cells toward a regulatory phenotype, securing a form of dominant tolerance to male skin grafts that is capable of resisting rejection by naive lymphocytes. Our results demonstrate that <b>incomplete</b> <b>signaling</b> through the TCR may establish a network of T(reg) cells that may be harnessed in the service of transplantation tolerance...|$|R

This problem, Matched Subspace Detection, is a classical, wellstudied problem when the signal is completely observed. Highdimensional testing problems in which it may be prohibitive or impossible to obtain a complete observation motivate this work. The signal is represented as a vector in R n, but we only observe m ≪ n of its elements. We show that reliable detection is possible, under mild incoherence conditions, as long as m is slightly greater than the dimension of the subspace in question. I...|$|R

30|$|Unlike {{other methods}} used to <b>address</b> <b>incomplete</b> data {{relating}} to social networks [4, 5], the question at hand is not if a rivalry exists, but rather to which rivalry a violent event belongs. This structure of between gang rivalries {{can be viewed as}} a social network [6] often embedded in space [1, 2]. Violent events involving gangs tend to be dyadic, and so we can formulate these events as a realization of a stochastic process occurring on the edges of the rivalry network. For each edge in the network there exists a different stochastic process. In our analysis however, we use identical parameters to generate synthetic data. The method does not assume that the underlying parameters generating each process are identical.|$|R

Promising simulation results for noise cancellation intensify the validity of superseding the proposed scheme for many existing techniques. To demonstrate the effectiveness, the proposed method is applied to different input conditions with varying SMRs.

40|$|Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) provide {{loans to}} low income individuals. The credit scoring systems of MFIs, if they exist, are {{strictly}} financial. Although many MFIs consider the social {{impact of their}} loans, they do not incorporate formal systems to estimate this social impact. This paper proposes that their creditworthiness evaluations should be coherent with their social mission and should, accordingly, estimate the social impact of microcredit. Thus, a decision support system to facilitate microcredit granting is proposed, and multicriteria evaluation is used to translate MFI’s social mission into numbers. The assessment of social impact is performed by calculating the Social Net Present Value (SNPV). The system captures credit officers’ experience and <b>addresses</b> <b>incomplete</b> and intangible information. The model has been tested in a microfinance institution.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{uncertainty}} relation for {{the representation of}} signals in two different general (possibly redundant or <b>incomplete)</b> <b>signal</b> sets. Specifically, our results improve on the well-known (1 + 1 /d) / 2 -threshold for dictionaries with coherence d by up to a factor of two. Furthermore, the new uncertainty relation is shown to lead to improved sparsity thresholds for recovery of signals that are sparse in general dictionaries. Furthermore, we provide probabilistic recovery guarantees for pairs of general dictionaries that also allow us to understand which parts of a general dictionary one needs to randomize over to ``weed out'' the sparsity patterns that prohibit breaking the square-root bottleneck. This uncertainty relation is relevant {{for the analysis of}} signals containing two distinct features each of which can be described sparsely in a suitable general signal set...|$|R

With this basis, cooling velocity maps during water quenching were predicted by finite element modeling (FEM) in which boundary conditions were obtained by solving the inverse heat conduction problem. Simulations under such conditions have been validated experimentally.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Comprehensive {{two-dimensional}} chromatography is {{a powerful}} technology for analyzing the patterns of constituent compounds in complex samples, but matching chromatographic features for comparative analysis across large sample sets is difficult. Various methods have been described for pairwise peak matching between two chromatograms, but the peaks indicated by these pairwise matches commonly are incomplete or inconsistent across many chromatograms. This paper describes a new, automated method for postprocessing the results of pairwise peak matching to <b>address</b> <b>incomplete</b> and inconsistent peak matches and thereby select chromatographic peaks that reliably correspond across many chromatograms. Reliably corresponding peaks can be used both for directly comparing relative compositions across large numbers of samples and for aligning chromatographic data for comprehensive comparative analyses.

Characteristically, equipment of this sort transmits information at speeds that are not under the operator’s control, and that are independent of his responses; i. e. performance of the particular task is mechanically paced. The modern environment contains numerous situations of this type.

40|$|Abstract—We {{challenge}} {{the perception that}} we live in a “proper world, ” where complex random signals can always be assumed to be proper (also called circularly symmetric). Rather, we stress the fact that the analytic signal constructed from a nonstationary real signal is in general improper, which means that its complementary correlation function is nonzero. We explore the consequences of this finding in the context of stochastic time-frequency analysis in Cohen’s class. There, the analytic signal plays a prominent role because it reduces interference terms. However, the usual time-frequency representation (TFR) based on the analytic signal gives only an <b>incomplete</b> <b>signal</b> description. It must be augmented by a complementary TFR whose properties are developed in detail in this paper. We show why it is still advantageous to use the pair of standard and complementary TFRs of the analytic signal rather than the TFR of the corresponding real signal.

Signal recovery was consistently better at an ISI of 6 sec compared to 3 sec. Significantly less signal recovery was associated with identical faces compared to different faces in bilateral mid-fusiform and right prefrontal regions {{but not in the}} calcarine and posterior fusiform regions. Repetition suppression effects contributed significantly to <b>incomplete</b> <b>signal</b> recovery in a region-specific manner. Simulations using empirically derived data suggest that experiments with shorter ISI (average 4. 5 – 6. 0 sec) are as sensitive as experiments with intermediate ISI (average 9 sec) in detecting response differences if experimental duration is equivalent. However, designs using intermediate ISI may be more appropriate if the expected difference in responses is small and if the number of suitable stimuli is limited. Hum.

The dynamic range here {{is defined as}} the tolerable operational range of the signal power to maintain a nearly complete WE performance. We studied the case of equal signal powers (balanced signal powers) as well as the case of unequal signal powers (imbalanced signal powers). It is demonstrated that the beating between exchanged signal and residual one and the extinction ratio degradation due to the existence of residual power at original channel is the major source of the signal quality degradation after WE II. The experimental results demonstrated dynamic range ∼ 17 dB with bit-error rate (BER) < 10 - 9 could be maintained with power penalty of < 2 dB in the case of balanced signal powers.

To ensure the visually plausibility and consistency constraints between the filled hole and the surroundings, we propose to construct a redundant signal dictionary by directly sampling from the intact source region of current image. Then we sequentially compute the sparse representation for each incomplete patch at the boundary of the hole and recover it until the whole hole is filled. Experimental results show that this approach can efficiently fill in the hole with visually plausible information, and take less risk to introduce unwanted objects or artifacts.

The only input signals needed are linear accelerations without any rotation information, which are provided by four Wiimote sensors attached to the four human limbs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the formant suppression effect on the perception of naturally-produced rounded and unrounded front vowels. In an open form response task, participants were asked to identify high and mid Dutch front vowels: the unrounded vowels /i,e/ and the rounded vowels /y,ø/. Vowels were presented either as complete <b>signals</b> or as <b>incomplete</b> <b>signals</b> where the second formant was suppressed. All complete vowels and incomplete unrounded vowels were perceived correctly. The incomplete rounded vowels, however, were more often perceived as their unrounded counterparts. This asymmetry can be explained by: (1) a formant representation where the third formant replaces the suppressed second formant; (2) a mismatch of formant amplitude for the case of incomplete rounded vowels, and (3) an educated guess based on the frequency of occurrence of the target vowels. Our findings show that the effects in natural vowels are similar to effects found in synthesized vowels. Vowel quality perception is based on formant frequency as primary cue and formant amplitude as secondary cue. Furthermore, the effect of frequency of occurrence provides evidence that vowel categories are not represented with equal strength in the cognitive system...|$|R

We present a data-based verification approach, for properties expressed in a probabilistic logic, that <b>addresses</b> <b>incomplete</b> model knowledge. We obtain experimental data from a system that can be modelled as a parametric Markov chain. We propose a novel verification algorithm to quantify the confidence the underlying system satisfies a given property of interest by using this data. Given a parameterised model of the system, the procedure first generates a feasible set of parameters corresponding to model instances satisfying a given probabilistic property. Simultaneously, we use Bayesian inference to obtain a probability distribution over the model parameter set from data sampled from the underlying system. The results of both steps are combined to compute a confidence the underlying system satisfies the property. The amount data required is minimised by exploiting partial knowledge of the system. Our approach offers a framework to integrate Bayesian inference and formal verification, and in our experiments our new approach requires one order of magnitude less data than standard statistical model checking {{to achieve the same}} confidence...|$|R

We first evaluate {{the role of}} incomplete information according to: (1) whether uncertainty helps select the effcient equilibrium outcome, and (2) whether more cooperation can be sustained under incomplete than under complete information. We then examine the possibility of information transmission among individuals in a signaling game. A separating equilibrium can be supported in which players with high concerns about fairness bear the cost of cooperating in order to reveal their type to opponents, thus promoting cooperation in subsequent periods. We also fi?nd a pooling equilibrium in which a player unconcerned about inequity aversion initially cooperates in order to mislead the uninformed player. This misleading strategy induces cooperation from the uninformed player in the subsequent stage of the game, moment at which the unconcerned player takes the opportunity to defect.
