5|$|In June 1854, McClellan {{was sent}} {{on a secret}} {{reconnaissance}} mission to Santo Domingo {{at the behest of}} Jefferson Davis. McClellan assessed local defensive capabilities for the secretary. (The information was not used until 1870, when President Ulysses S. Grant unsuccessfully attempted to annex the Dominican Republic.) Davis was beginning to treat McClellan <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> protégé, and his next assignment was to assess the logistical readiness of various railroads in the United States, once again with an eye toward planning for the transcontinental railroad. In March 1855, McClellan was promoted to captain and assigned to the 1st U.S. Cavalry regiment.|$|E

25|$|Its {{impact on}} art was significant: it {{extended}} beyond numismatics and {{the proliferation of}} outstanding Renaissance medals to influence sculpture and painting. Renaissance artists subsequently used Pisanello's portrait of John <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> stock type to represent exotic or antique figures. This {{can be seen in the}} work of Piero della Francesca who used the image of John in his Flagellation of Christ and Arezzo frescoes.|$|E

She paid for Clairmont {{to travel to}} her brother's home in Vienna where she stayed for a year, before relocating to Russia, where {{she worked as a}} governess from 1825 to 1828. The people she worked for treated her <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> member of the family. Still, what Clairmont longed for most of all was privacy and peace and quiet, as she complained in letters to Mary Shelley.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the nature}} of the HTPC, higher than average {{capacities}} are required for HTPC units to allow storage of pictures, music, television shows, videos, and other multimedia. Designed <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> 'permanent storage' device, space can quickly run out on these devices. Because of restrictions on internal space for hard disk drives and a desire for low noise levels, many HTPC units utilize a NAS (Network Attached Storage) device, or another type of network connected file server.|$|E
25|$|When {{he succeeded}} {{to the throne}} in January 1848, he was almost at once met by the demands for a constitution. The Schleswig-Holsteiners wanted an {{independent}} state while the Danes wished to maintain South Jutland as a Danish area. The king soon yielded to the Danish demands, and in March he accepted the end of absolutism, {{which resulted in the}} June Constitution of 1849. During the First War of Schleswig against the German powers in 1848–51, Frederick appeared as ”the national leader” and was regarded <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> war hero, despite having never taken any active part in the struggles.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} the medal is also clear {{from the number of}} Renaissance sculptors, {{illuminators}} and painters who used Pisanello's portrait of John <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> stock type for figures from distant lands or times. Piero della Francesca is perhaps the most celebrated artist in this respect. In his fresco of Constantine leading his troops into battle by the Milvian Bridge in The History of the True Cross series of frescos in Arezzo, the portrait and headgear of Constantine is clearly modeled on Pisanello's medal. Piero also used Pisanello's portrait of John to depict Pontius Pilate in his Flagellation of Christ.|$|E
25|$|Mineral {{pigments}} {{were also}} traded over long distances. The {{only way to}} achieve a deep rich blue was by using a semi-precious stone, lapis lazuli, to produce a pigment known as ultramarine, and the best sources of lapis were remote. Flemish painter Jan van Eyck, working in the 15th century, did not ordinarily include blue in his paintings. To have one's portrait commissioned and painted with ultramarine blue was considered a great luxury. If a patron wanted blue, they were obliged to pay extra. When Van Eyck used lapis, he never blended it with other colors. Instead he applied it in pure form, <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> decorative glaze. The prohibitive price of lapis lazuli forced artists to seek less expensive replacement pigments, both mineral (azurite, smalt) and biological (indigo).|$|E
25|$|Aristobulus's feeble health {{gradually}} {{lead his}} remaining reign {{under the control}} of a clique, at the head of which stood Queen Alexandra Salome, his wife. Through his machinations reign, he was led to suspect his favorite brother, Antigonus—whom he had entrusted with a share in the government, and whom he treated <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> coregent—of designs against him. When he showed signs of disease, the queen conspired to murder Antigonus. She deceived the king with suggestions that Antigonus was attempting to overthrow him by force. Salome then convinced Antigonus that his king wished to see his new armor, while telling Aristobulus that his brother was coming to kill him. Antigonus was killed by Aristobulus's guards before he could get close to his brother. Days later, Aristobulus died from pain and internal bleeding from an unknown disease, which Jews perceived his death as a sign of God's disgruntlement. The queen released the younger brothers from prison, placing Alexander Jannaeus on the throne.|$|E

25|$|The Lutherans {{were the}} first Protestant Church {{offering}} a dialogue to the Catholic Church in September 1964 in Reykjavík, Iceland. It resulted in joint study groups of several issues. The dialogue with the Methodist Church began October 1965, after its representatives officially applauded remarkable changes, friendship and cooperation {{of the past five}} years. The Reformed Churches entered four years later into a dialogue with the Catholic Church. The President of the Lutheran World Federation and member of the central committee of the World Council of Churches Fredrik A. Schiotz stated during the 450th anniversary of the Reformation, that earlier commemorations were viewed <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> triumph. Reformation should be celebrated as a thanksgiving to God, his truth and his renewed life. He welcomed the announcement of Pope Paul VI to celebrate the 1900th anniversary of the death of the Apostle Peter and Apostle Paul, and promised the participation and cooperation in the festivities.|$|E
25|$|The major propositions of Badiou's {{philosophy}} all {{find their}} basis in Being and Event, {{in which he}} continues his attempt (which he began in Théorie du sujet) to reconcile a notion of the subject with ontology, and in particular post-structuralist and constructivist ontologies. A frequent criticism of post-structuralist work is that it prohibits, through its fixation on semiotics and language, any notion of a subject. Badiou's work is, by his own admission, an attempt {{to break out of}} contemporary philosophy's fixation upon language, which he sees <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> straitjacket. This effort leads him, in Being and Event, to combine rigorous mathematical formulae with his readings of poets such as Mallarmé and Hölderlin and religious thinkers such as Pascal. His philosophy draws upon both 'analytical' and 'continental' traditions. In Badiou's own opinion, this combination places him awkwardly relative to his contemporaries, meaning that his work had been only slowly taken up. Being and Event offers an example of this slow uptake, in fact: it was translated into English only in 2005, a full seventeen years after its French publication.|$|E

Parliamentarian propaganda made much of this, treating Boye <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Devil's familiar.|$|E

500|$|As Wagner's last opera, Parsifal {{has been}} both {{influential}} and controversial. The use of Christian symbols in Parsifal (the Grail, the Spear, references to the Redeemer) together with its restriction to Bayreuth for almost 30 years sometimes led to performances being regarded <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> religious rite. It should be noted, however, that Wagner never actually refers to Jesus Christ by name in the opera, only to [...] "The Redeemer".

500|$|Religion and God are omnipresent {{throughout}} the collection, as evidenced {{from the first}} poem, [...] "Padamu Jua". Amir often uses the word [...] "Tuhan" [...] ("God"). However, unlike his earlier poems which used it {{in a similar manner}} to [...] "Dewa" [...] ("Deity"), in Nyanyi Sunyi the word is used as understood in Abrahamic religions, such as Amir's own Islam; Amir shows influences from Sufism. In some cases, writes Teeuw, Amir treats God <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lover, using familiar terms such as [...] "engkau" [...] ("you") to address Him. However, Amir recognises that he cannot be one with God. Jassin writes that Amir seems aware of his own smallness before God, acting as a puppet for God's will; Teeuw notes that Amir recognises that he would not exist if God did not.|$|E
500|$|The XB-70 used {{compression}} lift, which {{arose from}} a shock wave {{generated by the}} sharp {{leading edge of the}} central engine intake splitter plate below the wing. [...] At Mach 3 cruising speed, the shock wave attached along the wing leading edge, preventing the high pressure behind the shock front from leaking up over the wing. The compression lift provided five percent of the total lift. The wing included inboard camber to more effectively use the higher pressure field behind the strong shock wave. Unique among aircraft of its size, the outer portions of the wings were hinged, and could be pivoted downward by up to 65 degrees, acting <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> type of variable-geometry wingtip device. This increased the aircraft's directional stability at supersonic speeds, shifted the center of lift to a more favorable position at high speeds, and strengthened the compression lift effect. With the wingtips drooped downwards, the compression lift shock wave would be further trapped under the wings.|$|E
500|$|Lichens are a {{symbiotic}} relationship between fungi and photosynthetic algae or cyanobacteria. The photosynthetic partner in the relationship is referred to in lichen terminology as a [...] "photobiont". The fungal part of the relationship is composed mostly of various species of ascomycetes and a few basidiomycetes. Lichens occur in every ecosystem on all continents, {{play a key role}} in soil formation and the initiation of biological succession, and are prominent in some extreme environments, including polar, alpine, and semiarid desert regions. They are able to grow on inhospitable surfaces, including bare soil, rocks, tree bark, wood, shells, barnacles and leaves. As in mycorrhizas, the photobiont provides sugars and other carbohydrates via photosynthesis to the fungus, while the fungus provides minerals and water to the photobiont. The functions of both symbiotic organisms are so closely intertwined that they function <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> single organism; in most cases the resulting organism differs greatly from the individual components. Lichenization is a common mode of nutrition for fungi; around 20% of fungi—between 17,500 and 20,000 described species—are lichenized. Characteristics common to most lichens include obtaining organic carbon by photosynthesis, slow growth, small size, long life, long-lasting (seasonal) vegetative reproductive structures, mineral nutrition obtained largely from airborne sources, and greater tolerance of desiccation than most other photosynthetic organisms in the same habitat.|$|E
