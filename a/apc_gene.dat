25|$|Mutations and {{overexpression}} of β-catenin {{are associated}} with many cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, lung cancer, malignant breast tumors, ovarian and endometrial cancer. Alterations in the localization and expression levels of beta-catenin {{have been associated with}} various forms of heart disease, including dilated cardiomyopathy. β-catenin is regulated and destroyed by the beta-catenin destruction complex, and in particular by the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein, encoded by the tumour-suppressing <b>APC</b> <b>gene.</b> Therefore, genetic mutation of the <b>APC</b> <b>gene</b> is also strongly linked to cancers, and in particular colorectal cancer resulting from familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).|$|E

The A. variabilis cpcA and cpcB genes occur together in the genome, as do the apcA and apcB genes; {{the two sets of}} genes are not closely linked, however. The cpc and <b>apc</b> <b>genes</b> appear to be present in only one copy per genome. DNA-RNA hybridization analysis showed that expression of the cpc and <b>apc</b> <b>genes</b> is greatly decreased during nitrogen starvation; within 1 h no cpc or apc mRNA could be detected. The source of nitrogen for growth did not influence expression of the genes; vegetative cells from nitrogen-fixing and ammonia-grown cultures had approximately the same levels of cpc and apc mRNAs. Heterocysts had less than 5 % as much cpc mRNA as vegetative cells from nitrogen-fixing cultures. Northern hybridization (RNA blot) analysis showed that the cpc genes are transcribed to give an abundant 1. 4 -kilobase (kb) RNA as well as two less prominent 3. 8 - and 2. 6 -kb species.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{clinical}} and laboratory findings in an institutionalised adult patient originally referred for autism. A {{high risk of}} colorectal cancer was predicted when an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5, del(5) (q 15 q 22. 3), was detected in her lymphocytes and deletion of the MCC and <b>APC</b> <b>genes</b> confirmed by molecular analysis. Adenomatous polyposis coli and carcinoma of the rectum were subsequently diagnosed in the patient.

The deletion arose as a result of recombination within the small insertion loop formed at meiosis by the direct insertion (dir ins(5) (q 22. 3 q 14. 2 q 15)) found in the patient's mother.

25|$|In {{some cases}} FAP can {{manifest}} {{higher in the}} colon than usual (for example, the ascending colon, or proximal to the splenic flexure, or in the gastric or duodenal tracts) where they show no symptoms until cancer is present and greatly advanced. APC mutations {{have been linked to}} certain other cancers such as thyroid cancer. As the mutation causing FAP is genetic, it can be inherited hereditarily from either parent, and passed to children. A genetic blood test of the <b>APC</b> <b>gene</b> exists that can determine whether it is deficient, and therefore can predict the possibility of FAP. Individuals at risk (due to family links or genetic testing) are usually offered routine monitoring of the intestinal tract every 1 – 5 years for life, from early adulthood, to detect the slow-forming polyps and act if found, before they can pose a threat. International polyposis registries exists that track known cases of FAP or <b>APC</b> <b>gene</b> defects, for research and clinical purposes. Mutation of APC also occurs commonly in incident cases of colorectal carcinoma, emphasizing its importance in this form of cancer.|$|E
25|$|Depending on {{the nature}} of the defect in the <b>APC</b> <b>gene,</b> and whether it is the full or {{attenuated}} form, familial polyposis may manifest as polyps in colon or in the duodenal tract, or in any combination of these. Therefore, an absence of polyps in, for example, the rectum, may not of itself be sufficient to confirm absence of polyps. It may be necessary to consider and visually examine other possible parts of the intestinal tract. Colonoscopy is preferred over sigmoidoscopy for this, as it provides better observation of the common right-side location of polyps.|$|E
25|$|Familial adenomatous {{polyposis}} (FAP) is {{an inherited}} {{condition in which}} numerous adenomatous polyps form mainly in the epithelium of the large intestine. While these polyps start out benign, malignant transformation into colon cancer occurs when they are left untreated. Three variants are known to exist, FAP and attenuated FAP (originally called hereditary flat adenoma syndrome) are caused by <b>APC</b> <b>gene</b> defects on chromosome 5 while autosomal recessive FAP (or MYH-associated polyposis) is caused by defects in the MUTYH gene on chromosome 1. Of the three, FAP itself is the most severe and most common; although for all three, the resulting colonic polyps and cancers are confined to the colon wall and removal can greatly reduce the spread of cancer.|$|E
40|$|To clarify {{distinct}} genetic {{profiles of}} colorectal cancers based on tumor location (left- and right-sided), we evaluated {{the status of}} loss of heterozygosity (LOH), CpG islands methylation phenotype (CIMP), microsatellite instability (MSI), and mutations of p 53, Ki-ras, and <b>APC</b> <b>genes</b> in 119 colorectal cancers. Statuses of LOH (at 5 q, 8 p, 17 p, 18 q, and 22 q), MSI, and CIMP (MINT 1, MINT 2, MINT 31, MLH- 1, MGMT, p 14, p 16, and RASSF 1 A) were determined using microsatellite polymerase chain reaction and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction coupled with a crypt isolation method, respectively. In addition, mutations of p 53, Ki-ras, and <b>APC</b> <b>genes</b> were also examined. LOH, MSI, and CIMP status allowed us to classify samples into two groups: low or negative and high or positive. Whereas the frequency of p 53 mutations in the LOH-high status was significantly higher in left-sided cancers than in right-sided cancers, CIMP-high in the LOH-high status and MSI-positive status were more frequently found in right-sided cancers compared with left-sided cancers. Finally, location-specific methylated loci were seen in colorectal cancers: type I (dominant in right-sided cancer) and type II (common in both segments of cancer).

40|$|Abstract. Genes {{involved}} in anaerobic {{degradation of the}} petroleum hydrocarbon ethylbenzene in the denitrifying Azoarcus-like strain EbN 1 were identified on a 56 -kb DNA contig obtained from shotgun sequencing. Ethylbenzene is first oxidized via ethylbenzene dehydrogenase to (S) - 1 -phenylethanol; this is converted by S) - 1 -phenylethanol dehydrogenase to acetophenone. Further degradation probably involves acetophenone carboxylase forming benzoylacetate, a ligase forming benzoylacetyl-CoA, and a thiolase forming acetyl-CoA and benzoyl-CoA. Genes of this pathway were identified via N-terminal sequences of proteins isolated from strain EbN 1 and by sequence similarities to proteins from other bacteria. Ethylbenzene dehydrogenase is encoded by three genes (ebdABC), {{in accordance with the}} heterotrimeric enzyme structure. Binding domains for a molybdenum cofactor (in subunit EbdA) and iron/sulfur-clusters (in subunits EbdA and EbdB) were identified. The previously observed periplasmic location of the enzyme was corroborated by the presence of a twin-arginine leader peptide characteristic of the Tat system for protein export. A fourth gene (ebdD) was identified, the product of which may act as an enzyme-specific chaperone in the maturation of the molybdenum-containing subunit. A distinct gene (ped) coding for (S) - 1 -phenylethanol dehydrogenase apparently forms an operon with the ebdABCD genes. The ped gene product with its characteristic NAD(P) -binding motif in the N-terminal domain belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. A further operon apparently contains five <b>genes</b> (<b>apc</b> 1 - 5) suggested to code for subunits of acetophenone carboxylase. Four of the five gene products are similar to subunits of acetone carboxylase from Xanthobacter autotrophicus. Upstream of the <b>apc</b> <b>genes,</b> a single gene (bal) was identified which possibly codes for a benzoylacetate CoA-ligase and which is co-transcribed with the <b>apc</b> <b>genes.</b> In addition, an apparent operon containing almost all genes required for #-oxidation of fatty acids was detected; one of the gene products may be {{involved in}} thiolytic cleavage of benzoylacetyl-CoA. The DNA fragment also included genes for regulatory systems; these were two sets of two-component systems, two LysR homologs, and a TetR homolog. Some of these proteins may be involved in ethylbenzene-dependent gene expression...|$|R
25|$|Mutations of tumor {{suppressor}} {{genes that}} occur in germline cells are passed along to offspring, and increase the likelihood for cancer diagnoses in subsequent generations. Members of these families have increased incidence and decreased latency of multiple tumors. The tumor types are typical {{for each type of}} tumor suppressor gene mutation, with some mutations causing particular cancers, and other mutations causing others. The mode of inheritance of mutant tumor suppressors is that an affected member inherits a defective copy from one parent, and a normal copy from the other. For instance, individuals who inherit one mutant p53 allele (and are therefore heterozygous for mutated p53) can develop melanomas and pancreatic cancer, known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Other inherited tumor suppressor gene syndromes include Rb mutations, linked to retinoblastoma, and <b>APC</b> <b>gene</b> mutations, linked to adenopolyposis colon cancer. Adenopolyposis colon cancer is associated with thousands of polyps in colon while young, leading to colon cancer at a relatively early age. Finally, inherited mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 lead to early onset of breast cancer.|$|E

2500|$|The second form of FAP, {{known as}} {{attenuated}} {{familial adenomatous polyposis}} has the <b>APC</b> <b>gene</b> functional but slightly impaired. It is therefore somewhat able to operate as usual. [...] Attenuated FAP still presents a high 70% lifetime risk of cancer (as estimated), but typically presents with far fewer polyps (typically 30) rather than the hundreds or thousands usually found in FAP, [...] and arises {{at an age when}} FAP is usually no longer considered likely—typically between 40 and 70 years old (average 55) rather than the more usual 30's upward. Because it has far fewer polyps, options for management may be different.|$|E
40|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} {{hypothesized}} to arise after {{the accumulation of}} multiple mutations in critical oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. The relative timing of each mutation is unknown because the exact number and types of mutations differ between tumors. However, for every mutation except the first, tumor heterogeneity must exist until clonal dominance is reestablished. This principle was applied to mutant <b>APC</b> <b>genes</b> in eight colorectal adenomas. The APC mutations were homogeneously present throughout the adenomas, including those less than 1 cm in size, but absent from the normal polyp stalks. In one adenoma with APC and c-K-ras mutations, both mutations were simultaneously present in only a small discrete portion, suggesting that the c-K-ras mutation was acquired after the APC mutation. These findings suggest that when mutations in APC occur, they are usually {{one of the first}} events in colorectal carcinogenesis or provide such a strong selective advantage that intratumor heterogeneity is seldom observed...|$|R
40|$|In yeast and animals, the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) is an {{essential}} ubiquitin protein ligase that regulates mitotic progression and exit by controlling the stability of cell cycle regulatory proteins, such as securin and the mitotic cyclins.

To gain more insight into {{the roles of the}} plant APC/C, we characterized at the molecular level one of its subunits, APC 2, which is encoded by a single-copy gene in Arabidopsis. We show that the Arabidopsis gene is able to partially complement a budding yeast apc 2 ts mutant.
