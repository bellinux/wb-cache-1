40|$|I {{believe that}} {{creating}} guidelines as word processed documents primarily for paper publication {{leads to a}} number of problems: •	 There is a risk of the document expanding into a lengthy evidence based textbook which takes years to write and is expensive to revise [Eccles 02] •	 The bulk makes it hard for users to find the specific page, paragraph and sentence that applies to this patient this visit. It also makes it hard for human authors to ensure that the guideline is complete and that words are used consistently •	Any versions for different audiences (eg. patients, nurses, <b>audit</b> <b>clerks)</b> need to be written separately and kept by hand synchronised with the master version •	 The evidence shows that it is rare for such guideline documents themselves to change clinical practice or patient behavior [Grimshaw 04] •	 The material is designed to be read linearly, limiting our ability to extract text fragments to populate computer screens. To use the knowledge contained in the guideline for reminders or decision support, someone must spend weeks trying to locate and model small parts of the guideline as a knowledge base, only to find that it lacks detail or even disagrees with itself in places. I will argue that we should instead focus our evidence search and authoring process around proven clinical problems (ie. health decisions or actions with demonstrated and unexplained variation or deviation from evidence or patient preferences), rather than on a large number of questions spread out along the patient pathway. In addition, I believe we should publish guidelines primarily as a set of well structured computer reminders and alerts, with a secondary hypertext version reserved for browsing on screen...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Quality {{assurance}} of medical record keeping in general surgery is facilitated {{by use of}} the CRABEL Score. Critical appraisal and constant feedback to staff plays {{an important part in}} improving case-note quality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For each case-note audit, a house officer reviewed two sets of case notes for each of six consultant surgeons. Scores were awarded according to initial clerking, subsequent entries, consent, and discharge summary. Overall scores were derived by subtracting deductions for omissions in each category from a starting score of 100. A larger number of points deducted due to absent data leads to a lower overall score and indicates poorer quality case notes. After four <b>audits,</b> a <b>clerking</b> proforma specifically designed to address some of the common areas of weakness identified in our record keeping was introduced and a further audit was performed in March 2004 to assess its impact. RESULTS: The mean score was lowest in the September 2001 audit and improved over the next two audits. However, there was a small reduction in September 2003 compared to September 2002. When the individual sections of the score were looked at separately, the greatest contribution to a poor score comes from the 'subsequent entries' section since there are five entries scored individually leading to a cumulative effect on the overall score. Within both the 'initial clerking' and 'subsequent entries' sections, early audits showed poor performance across a range of areas but consistent poor implementation of the guidelines was seen in a small number of specific areas as record keeping improved. The quality of medical notes improved over the first three cycles but the improvement was not maintained subsequently. DISCUSSION: The CRABEL score {{has been shown to be}} a useful, reproducible and easy-to-perform objective assessment of the quality of medical record keeping. Repeated audit cycles have ensured that case-note quality remains a high priority and have also led to the development of standardised admission documentation. Introduction of the latter has led to a measurable improvement in medical record keeping...|$|R

5000|$|Priest's first story, [...] "The Run", was {{published}} in 1966. Formerly an accountant and <b>audit</b> <b>clerk,</b> he became a full-time writer in 1968. One of his early novels, The Affirmation, concerns a traumatized man who apparently flips into a delusional world in which he experiences a lengthy voyage to an archipelago of exotic islands. This setting featured in many of Priest's short stories, {{which raises the question}} of whether the Dream Archipelago is actually a fantasy. The state of mind depicted in this novel is similar to that of the delusional fantasy-prone psychoanalytic patient ("Kirk Allen") in Robert Lindner's The Fifty-Minute Hour, or Jack London's tortured prisoner in The Star Rover.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, at St. Augustine's High School, Sallah {{came under the}} {{influence}} of several Irish Holy Ghost Fathers as teachers: Reverends Murphy, Tammy, Comma and Gough. He credits Reverend Joseph Gough as the most influential Irish priest on his education and the mentor who sparked his interest into creative writing. He published his first poem, [...] "The African Redeemer", in the St. Augustine's school newspaper, Sunu Kibaro. Later, he rose to national prominence with the broadcasting of his work in the 1970s in the national radio program, Writers of The Gambia, hosted by Bemba Tambedou. In high school, he also credits several Gambian teachers as influences: Sait Touray, Marcel Thomasi, Foday Jarjusey, Sola Joiner, and Ralphena d'Almeida. From St. Augustine's, Sallah worked for two years as an <b>audit</b> <b>clerk</b> in the Government Post Office and then in Customs Department.
