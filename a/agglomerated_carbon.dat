Their microstructure and capacitance properties were carefully compared. As a result of the synergetic effect of mono-dispersion spheres and hierarchical porous structures, the MCNS sample shows improved electrochemical performance, i.e., the highest specific capacitance of 224  F g− 1 (0.2  A g− 1), the best rate capability (73 % retention at 20  A g− 1), and the most excellent capacitance retention of 93 % over 10, 000  cycles, making it to be the promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.|$|E

The prepared MCNS are uniform particle size with hierarchical pore structure while the PCNS show a wide size distribution and microporous structure, but the ACNS are firmly aggregated and nondispersible. MCNS, PCNS, and ACNS exhibited different electrochemical performance. The synergetic effect of mono-dispersion spheres and hierarchical porous structures contributes to the better electrochemical performance of MCNS. Compared to PCNS and ACNS, the as-prepared MCNS show the highest specific capacitance of 224  F g− 1 at 0.2  A g− 1, the best rate capability, and the most excellent capacitance retention of 93 % over 10, 000  cycles, which makes {{it to be the}} candidate for high-performance supercapacitors.|$|E

30|$|The {{carbonaceous}} {{materials such}} as carbon nanotubes (single-, double- or multi-walled) are prone to agglomerate due to the van der Waals interaction and π–π stacking between carbon particles and this problem cannot be solved by common laboratory techniques, such as sonication [12]. The attractive van der Waals forces in the single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNHs) {{are estimated to be}} in the range of 500  eV per micrometer of tube-to-tube contacts [11]. The good dispersion of carbon, especially structures like nanotubes or graphene, is needed to fully utilize their functions in hydrogels [13]. The nanodispersion of carbonaceous materials can be analyzed by several techniques, such as the optical fluorescence spectroscopy, a small-angle X-ray scattering, or deuterium solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance [14, 15]. These techniques allow to control an extent of homogeneity and to optimize it with respect to the composition of carbon-embedded hydrogels [16]. Yet, poor dispersion of carbons in aqueous solution and within hydrogels is related to their hydrophobic nature [17]. One of the most common methods for improving homogeneity of carbon suspension (in both liquids and hydrogels) is to apply surfactants or other additives [18, 19]. Overall, the methods of improving homogeneity of carbon are categorized as a covalent and non-covalent functionalization of carbons [12, 20]. As an example of covalent functionalization, {{it has been shown that}} appropriate chemical surface modification of carbon nanotubes with oxygen-containing moieties (oxalic, carboxylic, phenolic) can improve their dispersion in common solvents [21, 22]. Regarding the hydrogel-embedded carbons, it has been demonstrated that <b>agglomerated</b> <b>carbon</b> introduces local defects into the polymer, which significantly reduces its mechanical and electrochemical characteristics [23, 24]. The non-covalent modification refers to applying ionic surfactants such as the sodium dodecyl benzene carbonate (NaDDBS) or cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), which can enhance the dispersion of carbons in both organic (isopropyl alcohol- iPrOH) and aqueous solutions [25, 26].|$|E

30|$|The {{extraordinary}} electrical, mechanical, {{and thermal}} properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) make them the strongest candidates for their application in composite materials [1 – 3]. Good dispersion of CNTs {{is required for}} their application in many composites. However, CNTs are produced {{in the form of}} bundles where they are attracted together by van der Waals interactions. The aggregation of CNTs in the form of bundles influences the properties of the resulting composite materials e.g., ineffective stress transfer and higher percolation thresholds for electrical conductivity. Moreover, the <b>agglomerates</b> of <b>carbon</b> nanotubes may act as conventional carbon black and hence, to obtain improved material properties, the disaggregation of CNTs agglomerates is necessary [4 – 6].|$|R
30|$|Also, it {{has been}} {{postulated}} that homogeneity of carbon suspension depends on charge distribution at the carbon/solvent interface [27] and the interaction between polarized layers is defined by hydrodynamic shear factor known as zeta (ξ)-potential [28]. This potential depends on the chemical properties of both particle surface and solution composition (i.e., pH). The pH value corresponding to ξ[*]=[*] 0  mV {{is known as the}} isoelectric point (IEP) and, when the magnitude of the zeta potential is close to the IEP or smaller than a certain threshold, the repulsive forces between particles are weak and particle agglomeration occurs. The measurement of zeta potential offers a link between experiments and theoretical background. In particular, zeta potential is often associated with the value of electrical surface potential, Etot[*]=[*]EVW[*]+[*]EElec (where). This interparticle energy depends on the sum of attractive and repulsive interactions, which are both functions of the particle distance. The London–van der Waals contribution, EVW, between two particles of the same material is always attractive, thus promoting the aggregation of suspended particles. Instead, the repulsive component, EElec, can be explained by recalling the electric double-layer formation, i.e., the chemical phenomena occurring on the particle surface in a polar host fluid. In such conditions, the nanoparticle develops a surface charge according to the particle material. For example, in colloidal suspension of functionalized carbon-based particles dispersed in water, a negative surface charge is developed on the particle’s surface by the ionization of the surface groups (e.g., −[*]COOH). Because of the surface charge, an electrostatic potential is created in the proximity of nanoparticle, and a concentrated layer of counter ions, known as Stern layer, is formed. As a result, the zeta potential at the carbon surface exceeds the total interaction potential barrier (Etot), and at given distance the particle repelling is stronger than attractive than van der Walls forces, resulting in the formation of homogeneous suspensions [29]. An interesting phenomenon occurs during sonication of the carbon nanotube suspension in aliphatic solvent, when van der Waals forces between carbon sheets are broken, resulting in a local shear at the carbon–carbon contact, allowing the solvent to penetrate within <b>agglomerated</b> <b>carbon</b> particles [30]. Further study has shown that carbon nanotubes possess small negative zeta potential in aqueous solution and it varies depending on their purification method and an extent of surface functionalization [31].|$|E
40|$|Reinforcement of {{cementitious}} {{materials is}} a common technique for improving mechanical performance and preventing crack propagation, and is typically applied at the macro-scale, meso-scale (millimetre scale) and/or at the micro-scale using macrofibres and microfibres, respectively. Cementitious material failure is a multi-scale process, however, and also occurs at the nano-scale (10 - 9 m). The use of nano-additives may therefore be valuable in reinforcing cement hydration products at the nano-scale, bridging nano and micro cracks to prevent initial crack propagation, and refining the pore structure to densify the cement matrix. This research focuses {{on the use of}} carbon based nano-additives as nano-reinforcement agents in cementitious composites, with the aim of producing novel high performance nanocomposite materials for practical structural application (e. g. as repair materials). Four types of nano-additives were investigated: multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), functionalised MWCNTs, carbon nanofibres (CNFs), and “few layer graphene oxides” (FLGO). The unique geometrical characteristics of these additives in particular, as well as their mechanical properties such as high strength, ductility and stiffness, were the motivation for this study. In this work, extensive experimental studies have been conducted to develop practical and effective dispersion techniques for carbon nano-additives for cementitious application, and to produce novel cementitious composites with nano-additives (i. e. Nanofilaments Reinforced Cementitious Composites (NRCC)) and with hybrid nano-and-micro fibres (i. e Multiscale Hybrid Reinforced Cementitious Composites (MHRCC). The work has also focused on evaluating the efficiency of nanofilaments as nano reinforcement agents, controlling cracking {{and its impact on the}} durability of the produced composites. More specifically, test methods have been used to assess the shrinkage and cracking response of thin composite layers exposed to restrained shrinkage, and their sulfuric acid resistance. Furthermore, the potential application of the developed hybrid composites (MHRCC) as a layer repair/strengthening material was examined. Carbon nano-additives (MWCNTs, functionalised MWCNTs, CNFs, and GO) have a high tendency to agglomerate due to their strong Van der Waals self-attraction and hydrophobic surfaces. To date, ensuring a uniform dispersion in water and in the cementitious composite is the main challenge that hinders their effective use as a nano reinforcing agent. The present study focuses on a novel dispersion technique for dispersing the carbon nano-additives in water and in the cementitious composite. The effect of various intensities of sonication and treatment times, and the effect of surfactants and mineral admixtures on the dispersion behaviour were investigated. Nano-additive suspensions were semi-quantitatively and qualitatively analysed analysed using Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (Uv-vis) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The mechanical properties and microstructure of the resulting composite material were characterised through compressive, direct tensile strength, and Scanning Election microscopy (SEM) tests. It was found that periodic and short-duration, high-intensity sonication achieved superior dispersion of the <b>agglomerated</b> <b>carbon</b> nano-additives at different concentrations, and led to cementitious composites with improved mechanical performance. The new composite material overcomes a number of issues associated with conventional cementitious composites, in particular their tendency to crack at the nanoscale under loading, and during shrinkage. The obtained results on dispersion show that it is possible to produce composites reinforced (i) at the nano scale by incorporating a very low percentage of nanofilaments at 0. 025...|$|E
40|$|The next {{generation}} TFT-LCD is gradually developing for light, full-color and mobile display. Therefore, the color filter that {{plays a key}} element of TFT-LCD is to be improved for ultra high resolution and precision pattern by using nano-technology. That is it needs to decrease the distance between pixels and to increase aperture ratio. As a result, it's importance research to develop new material with higher optical density, lower conductivity, and free environmental problem for finer black matrix. With the property of larger specific surface area, lower content of the carbon black nano-particle in thinner polymeric film can show an excellent absorption and high shield effect to the visible light. In addition, as the carbon black nano-powders are well dispersed, the conductive path may be significantly reduced to form high electrical resistance in polymeric matrix. In this work, carbon black with the mean sizes of 15 nm and 24 nm, which are trademarked by CARBOT M- 900 and Mogul L, respectively, were added into co-solvent composed from PGMEA(propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate) and normal butyl alcohol decreasing surface tension to enhance the permeability of <b>agglomerated</b> <b>carbon</b> black, and then polymeric dispersant was used to stable carbon black nano-particles in the solution after dispersing process made on the mill method. Finally, the paste with carbon black nano-particles was blended with multi-functional group acrylic resin, reactive monomer DPHA(Dipentaerythritol pena-/hexa-acrylate) containing 5 functional group as well as high extinction coefficient of photo-initiator (CGI- 242 and I 369) to form high performance photo-resist with carbon black nano-particles for black matrix of color filter.

Criteria for dispersion and erosion kinetics were determined. Carbon black pellets and silica micropearls showed different elementary mechanisms for dispersion. A relationship between the criterion for fragmentation and the internal organisation of the agglomerate could be established. These in-situ observations allow us to study the first steps of dispersion down to the micron size. They show that an efficient mechanism of dispersion (rupture or disintegration) is first necessary to reduce the agglomerate size during a mixing operation.

For this study, DPM was generated by a 1. 5 -L diesel engine and the fuel was doped with ferrocene to enhance the level of iron in the system. The exhaust particles were collected on TEM grids and analyzed using the Philips CM 12 TEM/EDS instrument. Results show that when the iron-to-carbon (soot) ratio (Fe/C) in the engine is low, the exhaust particles have morphologies similar to those for the undoped case, but at a threshold Fe/C value of 0. 013 (for this engine), homogeneously nucleated metallic nanoparticles are formed and begin agglomerating. The number and size of these nanoparticles increase with level of doping. Metal-bearing particles that span a wider size range are also formed.

Both materials show a high selectivity at close to full conversion in terms of amine formation (> 99 %) without changing the configuration of the central stilbene Cdouble bond; length as m-dashC double bond. The continuous hydrogenation process was first tested in lab scale reactors (2 mL and 6 mL) combined with a high pressure interdigital micromixer to ensure efficient three-phase contact. While the specific reactor performance (defined as productivity per unit of reactor volume) was 1. 5 -fold higher for the Pt/ZnO, the NCNT catalyst was found to be more suitable for flow operation due to a lower pressure drop over the catalytic packed bed. The catalytic reactor was then scaled up to 50 mL and operated in the EcoTrainer mobile modular platform for the hydrogenation of the Ombrabulin intermediate demonstrating a safe, flexible and sustainable fine chemical synthesis...|$|R
30|$|However, {{despite the}} undoubted {{progress}} {{in the analysis of}} possible mechanisms responsible for the formation of properties of nanofilled elastomers, there are still ambiguities to be clarified. An increase in strength and the appearance of anisotropic properties after the first deformation {{can be attributed to the}} existence of micro and nanostrands in its structure. Their existence is confirmed by experimental studies (Marckmann et al., 2016; Reichert et al., 1993; Le Cam et al., 2004; Watabe et al., 2005; Beurrot et al., 2010; Marco et al., 2010). In (Matos et al., 2012), based on the results of experimental studies of the carbon-filled rubber structure (using electron microtomography) and computer simulation, it was shown that the macrodeformation of about 15 % can cause significant microdeformation of the matrix of 100 and more percent in the zones between the <b>agglomerates</b> of <b>carbon</b> black particles. Investigations of the nanostructure of filled rubbers in a stretched (up to pre-rupture) state by the atomic force microscopy methods (AFM) demonstrate the formation of a fibrous texture between filler particles (Morozov et al., 2012). Tomograms of the microstructure of rubber (electron microscopy), obtained in (Akutagava et al., 2008) also show strands and strand-linked aggregates of carbon black particles.|$|R
40|$|Aerosol {{particles}} collected {{inside the}} museum of the Wawel Castle in Cracow, Poland, were characterized {{with respect to their}} size and composition. Two micro-analytical techniques, electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and micro Raman spectrometry (MRS) were applied. These techniques provide the elemental composition and the molecular identification of the particles, respectively. To distinguish between particle types, the hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was applied independently to each size fraction. The fine fraction consisted mostly of amorphous carbon (including soot), while in the micrometer fraction a significant amount of amorphous <b>carbon</b> <b>agglomerated</b> with the omnipresent ammonium sulphate appeared. Many of the larger particles were complex agglomerates. The larger particles contained more soil-derived particles. Organic particles were very important too, and an unexpected contribution by Cu-rich particles, probably from the wear of the huge Flemish tapestries exhibited in the museum, was observed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposes to}} assess the {{efficiency}} of ZnAl 2 O 4 obtained by combustion reaction {{on the process of}} esterification and transesterification of soybean oil to biodiesel production. In the synthesis it was used three heating conditions: spiral resistance, muffle furnace, and microwave oven. In order to investigate the influence of the heating source on the structure, morphology, and on the catalytic activity, the samples were characterized by XRD, FTIR, granulometric analysis, TGA, carbon content, TEM, and gas chromatography. The results showed {{that it was possible to}} obtain the ZnAl 2 O 4 cubic phase with traces of ZnO. The ZnAl 2 O 4 monophasic was just obtained by the synthesis carried out in the microwave oven and in the electrical resistance. All the samples showed a typical morphology of dense <b>agglomerates</b> and low <b>carbon</b> content. The samples also presented low catalytic activity in the esterification and transesterification process under the adopted conditions...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{this project}} is the {{optimization}} of manufacturing technology of the ceramic preforms basedon Al 2 O 3 powder manufactured by the pressure infiltration method with liquid metal alloy. Design/methodology/approach: Ceramic preforms were manufactured by the method of sintering of ceramicpowder. The preform material consists of powder Condea Al 2 O 3 CL 2500, however, as the forming factor ofthe structure of canals and pores inside the ceramic <b>agglomerated</b> framework the <b>carbon</b> fibers Sigrafil C 10 M 250 UNS were used. Then ceramic preforms were infiltrated with liquid EN AC – AlSi 12 aluminum alloy. Stereological and structure investigations of obtained composite materials were made on light microscope. Findings: It was proved that developed technology of manufacturing of composite materials with the pore ceramicAl 2 O 3 infiltration ensures expected structure {{and can be used}} in practice. Practical implications: The developed technology allows to obtain method’s elements locally reinforced andcomposite materials with precise shape mapping.

30|$|A {{specific}} indoor discoloration event {{related to}} heating points {{and the presence}} of semi volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) has been repeatedly reported in the literature under various names, which include “ghosting” [120], “black magic dust” [121] and “fogging” [122]. Even though there have been no specific mentions of the phenomenon in a heritage context, it is clearly not exclusively found in dwellings “ghosting” deposits differ from dry deposition by the presence of droplet-like particles, and a layer of condensed SVOCs [123]. The phenomenon is triggered only under certain conditions: emission of SVOCs (e.g. from refurbished materials), low ventilation rates, high temperature gradients (e.g. above lamps or radiators), and, naturally, the presence of PM. The dark appearance of stains is caused by the presence of elemental and organic <b>carbon</b> <b>agglomerates,</b> but coarse dust particles rich in Ca and Fe can be present as well [123]. Even though efforts have been made to isolate the causes that can initiate this soiling event, all attempts to reproduce it in experimental conditions have been unsuccessful [124].|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} for {{the first}} time that <b>agglomerates</b> of multiwalled <b>carbon</b> nanotubes (MWCNTs) can be formed in which the binder in the agglomerate is itself a redox-active molecular solid. Two separate agglomerates were formed by dissolving 9, 10 -phenanthraquinone (PAQ) or 1, 2 -napthaquinone (NQ) in acetone together with MWCNTs and adding an excess of aqueous solution to cause precipitation of agglomerates, approximately 10 microns in dimension, which consist of bundles of nanotubes running into and throughout the amorphous molecular solid that binds the agglomerate together. The nature of this structure, when immobilised on a substrate electrode and in contact with aqueous electrolyte solutions, gives rise to many three-phase boundaries, electrolyte|agglomerate|conductor, which is advantageous to the solid-state analytical electrochemistry of such a material as it imparts a larger electroactive surface area than other modified carbon electrodes. The two agglomerates each gave a voltammetrically measurable response to changes in pH; when abrasively immobilised on a basal plane pyrolitic graphite electrode a plot of peak potential against pH produced a linear response for both MWCNT-PAQ and MWCNT-NQ agglomerates over the pH range pH 1 - 12 and over the temperature range 20 - 70 degrees C...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) tend to readily agglomerate {{and settle}} down in water, while the adsorption of compounds present in natural aquatic media could enhance their dispersion and stabilization {{in the water}} column. We designed a new exposure protocol to compare the biological responses of Xenopus laevis larvae exposed in semi-static conditions to size-reduced <b>agglomerates</b> of multi-walled <b>carbon</b> nanotubes (MWCNTs) in suspension {{in the water column}} and/or to larger agglomerates. Suspensions were prepared using a combination of a non-covalent functionalization with a non-toxic polymer (either carboxymethylcellulose, CMC, or gum arabic, GA) and mechanical dispersion methods (mainly ultrasonication). The ingestion of agglomerates which have settled down was incriminated in the disruption of the intestinal transit and the assimilation of nutrients, leading to acute and chronic toxicities at the highest tested concentrations. Rise in mortality, decrease in the growth rate and induction of genotoxicity from low concentrations (1 mg/L in the presence of CMC) were evidenced in presence of suspended MWCNTs in the water column. The biological responses seemed to be modulated when GA, a potential antioxidant, was used. We hypothesized that MWCNTs should interfere mainly at the surface of the gills, acting as a potential respiratory toxicant and generally inducing indirect effects...|$|R
40|$|Lithium iron {{phosphate}} {{has become}} {{of great interest}} as storage cathode {{for the next generation}} of rechargeable lithium batteries. Olivine structure LiFePO 4 /C composite powder was prepared by ultrasound assisted synthesis. A polyvinyl alcohol solution was used as the source of an in situ formed carbon. X-ray powder diffraction confirmed the phase purity. X-ray powder diffraction data were used for the crystal structure refinement, based on Rietveld full profile method. All relevant structural and microstructural crystal parameters that could be significant for electrochemical intercalation/deintercalation processes were determined. The Rietveld refinement also showed additional electron density on the lithium sites, indicating 3 at. % iron on the lithium site. Electrochemical characteristic of the composite was evaluated by using galvanostatic charge/discharge tests. While cycling at C/ 3 (C/ 10) rate the discharge capacity increases, starting from the value of 94. 1 (116. 0) mAh/g and reaching 99. 5 (124. 0) mAh/g at the end of the cycling. Particle morphology was revealed by both scanning and transmission electron microscopies. On the thin particle edges carbon film with a typical thickness of several nanometers can be observed, as well as small <b>carbon</b> <b>agglomerates</b> (typical size < 6 nm) at certain spots on the substrate surface...|$|R
40|$|Agglomerates of Pt {{nanoparticles}} were synthesized {{by using}} H- 2 as reduction reagent and nafion as stabilizer. The electrode of agglomerates of Pt nanoparticles was prepared by dispersing the <b>agglomerates</b> onto glassy <b>carbon</b> surface and is denoted as Pt-a(ag) /GC. The average {{size of the}} agglomerates in colloid and {{on the surface of}} electrode were characterized to be around 400 nm using TEM and SEM, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry and in situ FTIR spectroscopy were employed to study electrocatalytic properties of the Pt-a(ag) /GC electrode towards methanol oxidation. It has been revealed that the agglomerates of Pt nanoparticles exhibit significant electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of CH 3 OH. In comparison with CH 3 OH oxidation on an electrode of Pt thin film supported on Au, the oxidation potential has been shifted negatively about 300 mV on the Pt-a(ag) /GC. The results demonstrated also that the oxidation of CH 3 OH is a complex process, which may be influenced by the diffusion of CH 3 OH and controlled by the oxidation-reduction of the agglomerates of Pt nanoparticles on electrode surface. Linearly adsorbed CO species (COL) is the only intermediate that has been determined by in situ FTIR spectroscopy. The IR features Of COL illustrated that the agglomerates of Pt nanoparticles exhibit abnormal infrared effects as other kind low-dimensional nanomaterial does...|$|R
