5|$|A single High Angle Control System {{director}} was fitted {{on the island}} and another on an elevated mount on the former flying-off deck. Two pom-pom directors were also mounted on the island for the weapons mounted fore <b>and</b> <b>aft</b> of the island.|$|E
5|$|Australia carried eight BL 12-inch Mark X guns in four BVIII* twin turrets; {{the largest}} guns fitted to any Australian warship. Two turrets were mounted fore <b>and</b> <b>aft</b> on the centreline, {{identified}} as 'A' and 'X' respectively. The other two were wing turrets mounted amidships and staggered diagonally: 'P' was forward and to port of the centre funnel, while 'Q' was situated starboard <b>and</b> <b>aft.</b> Each wing turret had some limited ability to {{fire to the}} opposite side. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen BL 4-inch Mark VII guns positioned in the superstructure. She mounted two submerged tubes for 18-inch torpedoes, {{one on each side}} aft of 'X' barbette, and 12 torpedoes were carried.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} {{was divided into}} three decks, the upper two for passengers and the lower for cargo. The two passenger decks were divided into forward <b>and</b> <b>aft</b> compartments, separated by the engines and boiler amidships.|$|E
2500|$|The AFT {{has long}} sought merger with the NEA on a {{national}} level. But acrimonious relationships between the two unions {{on the local level}} <b>and</b> <b>AFT's</b> insistence on what NEA and its affiliates consider undemocratic practices <b>and</b> <b>AFT's</b> insistence upon affiliation with the AFL-CIO are significant obstacles. Among AFT's [...] "undemocratic" [...] practices are its abolition of the secret ballot, its requirement that delegates to its convention vote for officers by roll-call ballot, identifying their choices and their names in writing.|$|R
2500|$|As built, {{the ships}} were armed with two [...] SMP 3 {{automatic}} cannon, with single turrets, one forward <b>and</b> one <b>aft,</b> <b>and</b> a single twin 40mm Bofors mount. The SMP 3 {{was the first}} model of Italian automatic 76mm guns, and could fire bursts of shells at 50 rounds per minute from a 14 round drum magazine, with [...] shells reaching a range of [...] Anti-submarine armament consisted of two Hedgehog forward with depth charge projectors <b>and</b> racks <b>aft.</b>|$|R
50|$|The crew {{compartment}} was enclosed—a new development—and {{there were two}} passenger cabins, one forward <b>and</b> one <b>aft</b> of the wings. The H.P.42E carried six (later 12) in the forward compartment and twelve in the aft. There was substantial baggage room. The H.P.42W seated 18 forward <b>and</b> 20 <b>aft,</b> with reduced baggage capacity.|$|R
5|$|The ship carried eight BL 12-inch Mk X guns in four {{twin gun}} turrets. Two turrets were mounted fore <b>and</b> <b>aft</b> on the centreline, {{identified}} as 'A' and 'X' respectively. The other two were wing turrets mounted amidships and staggered diagonally: 'P' was forward and to port of the centre funnel, while 'Q' was situated starboard <b>and</b> <b>aft.</b> Each wing turret had a limited ability to {{fire to the}} opposite side, but if the ship was full broadside to her target she could bring all eight main guns to bear. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen 4-inch BL Mk VII guns positioned in the superstructure. She mounted two 18-inch submerged torpedo tubes, {{one on each side}} aft of 'X' barbette, and twelve torpedoes were carried.|$|E
5|$|The ships mounted four 10-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns in twin-gun turrets fore <b>and</b> <b>aft</b> of the superstructure. The guns could fire both solid {{shot and}} {{explosive}} shells. They were mounted on carriages that used hydraulic jacks to elevate and depress the guns.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertical}} triple expansion engines consumed {{large amounts}} of internal space that could otherwise {{have been used for}} magazines. Without sufficient magazine capacity to support superfiring centerline turrets, designers were compelled to distribute six main turrets in an unusual hexagonal configuration. Two twin turrets were mounted fore <b>and</b> <b>aft</b> (one on each end), and two were mounted on each flank of the ship. Firing directly forward <b>and</b> <b>aft,</b> the ships could bring 6 guns to bear, and 8 on the broadside; this was the same theoretical capability as Dreadnought, but the Nassau-class ships required two additional guns to achieve it. It was considered that this arrangement provided a useful reserve of heavy guns that were shielded from enemy fire.|$|E
50|$|A single 7-inch rifled muzzle-loading gun {{amidships}} and 2 6.3-inch 64-pounder rifled muzzle-loading guns, one forward <b>and</b> one <b>aft,</b> <b>and</b> both fitted on traversing slides, constituted {{her main}} armament. Two {{machine guns and}} a light gun were also fitted.|$|R
50|$|As built, {{the ships}} were armed with two 76 mm SMP 3 {{automatic}} cannon, with single turrets, one forward <b>and</b> one <b>aft,</b> <b>and</b> a single twin 40 mm Bofors mount. The SMP 3 {{was the first}} model of Italian automatic 76 mm guns, and could fire bursts of shells at 50 rounds per minute from a 14 round drum magazine, with 6 kg shells reaching a range of 16000 m. Anti-submarine armament consisted of two Hedgehog forward with depth charge projectors <b>and</b> racks <b>aft.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{rangefinder}} {{was installed}} on the bridge and her fore <b>and</b> <b>aft</b> holds were refitted as magazines. Half-inch (12.7mm) steel plating was added to protect her steering gear and her interior cabin bulkheads and glass ventilators were removed to reduce damage from splinters. Her furniture was removed {{to make room for}} the mess decks needed to feed large numbers of troops and sailors and an operating room and sickbay were installed amidships.|$|E
5|$|Canada was {{transferred}} to the 1st Battle Squadron on 12 June 1916. In 1917–18, she was fitted with better rangefinders and range dials, and two of the aft 6-inch secondary guns were removed after they suffered blast damage from the middle 14-inch turret. In the latter year, flying-off platforms for aircraft were added atop the superfiring turrets fore <b>and</b> <b>aft.</b> Canada was put into the reserve fleet in March 1919.|$|E
5|$|Four Type 94 high-angle fire-control {{directors}} were fitted {{to control the}} Type 89 guns. The two controlling the port-side guns were adjacent to their guns while the starboard {{directors were}} mounted fore <b>and</b> <b>aft</b> on the island. They could control all of the forward and rear guns respectively as necessary. Type 22 and Type 13 air search radars may have been fitted.|$|E

5|$|Minas Geraes and São Paulo were {{originally}} armed with twelve 12-inch/45 caliber, twenty-two 4.7-inch/50 caliber, eighteen 3-pounders and eight 1-pounder naval guns. The main battery was arranged with four superfiring turrets, two each fore <b>and</b> <b>aft,</b> and two placed en echelon. The 4.7-inch secondary guns {{were placed in}} casemates {{along the side of}} the ship.|$|E
5|$|Pre-dreadnoughts carried guns {{of several}} {{different}} calibres, for different roles in ship-to-ship combat. The main armament was four heavy guns, mounted in two centre-line turrets fore <b>and</b> <b>aft.</b> Very few pre-dreadnoughts deviated from this arrangement. These guns were slow-firing, and initially of limited accuracy; {{but they were}} the only guns heavy enough to penetrate the thick armour which protected the engines, magazines, and main guns of enemy battleships.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{conflict}} on {{the number}} of torpedo tubes originally included in the ships, but it is clear they were located on the berth deck and had above-water ports located on the extreme front <b>and</b> <b>aft</b> and midships. Located too close to the waterline to allow use while moving and vulnerable to gunfire when opened, they were considered useless and were quickly reduced in number, and removed entirely before 1908.|$|E

25|$|Anchor seiners {{have the}} {{wheelhouse}} <b>and</b> accommodation <b>aft</b> <b>and</b> the working deck amidships, thus resembling side trawlers. The seine net is stored and {{shot from the}} stern, and they may carry a power block. Anchor seiners have the coiler and winch mounted transversally amidships.|$|R
50|$|The E50 type {{shared a}} flush-decked layout with the E52 class, {{and had a}} similar {{armament}} of three twin 57mm turrets) (one forward <b>and</b> two <b>aft)</b> <b>and</b> an anti-submarine armament consisting of a battery of heavyweight guided torpedoes and a 375mm Bofors six-barrel rocket launcher.|$|R
5|$|The {{armament}} of the Warrior-class ships {{was intended}} to be 40 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder guns, 19 on each side on the main deck and one each fore <b>and</b> <b>aft</b> as chase guns on the upper deck. This was modified during construction to ten rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns, twenty-six 68-pounders, and four rifled breech-loading 40-pounder guns.|$|E
5|$|The major {{components}} of the Mk 38 Gun Fire Control System (GFCS) were the Director, Plotting Room, and interconnecting data transmission equipment. Two systems, forward <b>and</b> <b>aft,</b> were each complete and independent. Their plotting rooms were isolated to protect against battle damage propagating {{from one to the}} other.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} armed with four BL 12-inch Mk X guns {{arranged}} in two twin gun turrets, one each fore <b>and</b> <b>aft.</b> Her secondary armament consisted of ten BL 9.2-inch Mk XI guns, in twin gun turrets on each {{corner of the}} superstructure, and a single gun turret between them, plus 24 QF 12-pounder 18 cwt guns. She also mounted five submerged 17.7-inch (457mm) torpedo tubes for which 23 torpedoes were stowed aboard.|$|E

50|$|Her hull was of {{unprecedented}} strength and structural integrity, {{with a relatively}} short length {{in proportion to the}} great power developed, a cut away forefoot, rounded bottom, <b>and</b> fore, <b>aft</b> <b>and</b> side heeling tanks. Diesel electric machinery was chosen for its controlability and resistance to damage.|$|R
5|$|The ship's main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} four BL 9.2-inch Mark X guns in two twin-gun turrets, one each fore <b>and</b> <b>aft.</b> Her secondary armament of ten BL 7.5-inch Mark II guns were mounted amidships in single turrets. Anti-torpedo boat defence {{was provided by}} sixteen QF 12-pounder (3-inch) 18-cwt guns. Shannon also mounted five submerged 17.7-inch torpedo tubes, {{one of which was}} mounted in the stern.|$|E
5|$|Two 274-millimetre Modèle 1870 {{guns were}} mounted in barbettes {{on the upper}} deck, one gun at the forward corner of the battery, with the {{remaining}} six 274-millimetre Modèle 1870 guns on the battery deck below the barbettes. Eight 138-millimetre Modèle 1870 guns were on the upper deck, fore <b>and</b> <b>aft</b> of the barbettes, and on the battery deck.|$|E
5|$|A Type 271 surface {{search radar}} {{replaced}} the fire-control director and rangefinder above the bridge. A Type 290 surface warning radar was added {{at the top}} of the foremast. A High frequency direction finding system was added on a pole mast aft. The ship also received a Type 242 IFF system. Two 4.7-inch guns were removed, one each forward <b>and</b> <b>aft,</b> and the forward gun was replaced by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar. The 3-inch anti-aircraft gun amidships was also removed, but the number of 20mm AA guns was increased to six.|$|E
