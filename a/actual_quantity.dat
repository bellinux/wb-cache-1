25|$|Although the Eskayan lexicon bears {{a marked}} Spanish influence, the loan-patterns {{are hard to}} map. Some Spanish words {{appear to have been}} {{directly}} borrowed into Eskayan with virtually no semantic or phonetic alterations. E.g., the Eskayan word merido, meaning ‘husband’, is evidently loaned from the Spanish marido, also meaning ‘husband’. Others retain {{only a few of the}} semantic properties of the original. E.g., the word astro means ‘sun’ in Eskayan but ‘star’ in Spanish. In some interesting cases Eskayan lexical items appear to be borrowed but are assigned new meanings entirely. E.g., the Eskayan memorya (‘sky’) does not coincide semantically with the Spanish memoria (‘memory’). One of the most intriguing examples of such an ‘interrupted loan’ is that of the Eskayan tre (‘two’) seemingly derived from the Spanish tres (‘three’). Here the semantic property of ‘number’ was retained but the <b>actual</b> <b>quantity</b> it represented was reassigned.|$|E
25|$|The bridge has {{not always}} been the source of tragedy, the evening of the 18th of May 1969 is fondly remembered by many of the {{community}} when a truck laden with Bushmills and Cream of Barley Whiskey was traveling from Antrim to Dublin when its brakes failed coming down the hill and it rolled over the bridge wall into the river some 3 meters or so below, the driver survived and was brought to Hospital but the entire loot of liquor was strewn across the river bottom. Most of the town of Slane were quick on the scene, vans and truck were seen spiriting away from the wreck of the truck in the dead of night. Several prosecutions followed, the <b>actual</b> <b>quantity</b> of whiskey taken away is still known only to the management of Bushmills and perhaps to the Insurance Company that followed up the claim. The following day five Irish Divers, Brian Cusack, Sean Sheridan, Joe Murray, Fergus McKenna and Sean Donohoe arrived and while the local people of Slane were still dredging for bottles they collected 408 bottles in total, the local butcher in Slane at the time was apparently still drinking Bushmills Whiskey four years later.|$|E
25|$|A 3-cent Washington-head coil stamp (Scott 389) {{issued in}} 1911 is {{commonly}} referred to as the Orangeburg coil. It was printed with the flat-plate press on single-line watermarked paper with vertical, gauge 12, perforations. The Post Office produced only a small batch of these stamps (it would soon switch over to gauge 8½ perforations for coils) and apparently sold them all to the Bell Pharmaceutical Company, which used 3¢ coil stamps to send samples of their products to physicians through the mail. The <b>actual</b> <b>quantity</b> issued remains unknown. The earliest known use on cover is dated April 27, 1911. Due to the quantity of mail, they were put through the first-class canceling machine at Orangeburg, New York and were mailed third-class. Because these stamps were used on third class mail, most were eventually discarded. Owing to its limited and specific usage philatelists were at first unaware of this issue for approximately two years and so very few examples were saved and collected in mint condition, which accounts for their rarity of this issue today. Approximately twelve covers have been certified as genuine by the Philatelic Foundation. The Orangeburg coils are the rarest coils of the Washington-Franklin issues.|$|E

The <b>actual</b> <b>quantity</b> {{of money}} which it coins, in {{relation}} to its real property, is therefore only of consequence for convenience of exchange; but the proportion in which this quantity of money is divided among individuals expresses their various rights to greater or less proportions of the national property, and must not, therefore, be tampered with. The government may at any time, with perfect justice, double its issue of coinage, if it gives every man who has ten pounds in his pocket another ten pounds, and every man who had ten pence another ten pence; for it thus does not make any of them richer; it merely divides their counters for them into twice the number. But if it gives the newly-issued coins to other people, or keeps them itself, it simply robs the former holders to precisely that extent. This most important function of money, as a title-deed, on the non-violation of which all national soundness of commerce and peace of life depend, has been never rightly distinguished by economists from the quite unimportant function of money {{as a means of}} exchange. You can exchange goods--at some inconvenience, indeed, but you can still contrive to do it--without money at all; but you cannot maintain your claim to the savings of your past life without a document declaring the amount of them, which the nation and its government will respect.|$|E
6000|$|Although the State may not {{promise to}} pay a dollar, yet, {{wherever}} [...] such paper money carries any purchasing power with it (which has [...] very seldom happened, and then only for short periods), it will be [...] found {{that there is a}} vague popular understanding that the State [...] intends, at some time or other, to redeem the notes with value in [...] coin to some amount. In the early cases of irredeemable money in [...] our colonies, the income of taxes, or similar resources, were [...] promised as a means of redemption. To some—although a [...] slight—extent, the idea of value was associated with such paper. [...] The <b>actual</b> <b>quantity</b> issued did not measure the depreciation. The [...] paper did depreciate with increased issues. But only in so far as [...] the increased issues proved to the community that there was less [...] and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they [...] depreciate. In other words, we come to the familiar experience, [...] known to many, of a paper money depending for its value on the [...] opinions of men in the country. This was partially true, even of [...] our own greenbacks, which were not fiat money, but promises to [...] pay (although not then redeemable), as may be seen by the movement [...] of the line in Chart XII (p. 359), which represents the [...] fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war. The upward [...] movement of the line, which indicates the premium on gold during [...] our late war, of course represents correspondingly the [...] depreciation of the paper. Every victory or defeat of the Union [...] arms raised or lowered the premium on gold; it was the register of [...] the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with [...] the paper. The second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks [...] were regarded as confessions of financial distress; it was this [...] which produced the effect on their value. It was not only the [...] quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity. It [...] is, of course, clear that the value of a paper money like the [...] greenbacks, which were the promises to pay of a rich country, [...] would bear a definite relation to the <b>actual</b> <b>quantity</b> issued; and [...] this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on [...] the chart, showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the [...] issues increased. But the thing which weighed largely in people’s [...] minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption; and the premium [...] on gold was practically a register of the “betting” on this [...] possibility. In 1878, when Secretary Sherman’s reserve was seen to [...] be increasing to an effective amount, and when it became evident [...] that he would have the means (i.e., the value represented by all [...] the paper that was likely to be presented) to resume on the day [...] set, January 1, 1879, the premium gradually faded away. The [...] general shifting of the level to a lower stage in this later [...] period was not due to any decrease in the quantity outstanding, [...] because the contraction had been stopped in 1868, and that [...] consequent on the resumption act in May, 1878.|$|E

40|$|Much {{attention}} {{has been placed on}} measuring performance of activity completion in Lean literature, using techniques such as Percentage of Planned Activities Completed (PPC). Originally intended as one component of measuring plan execution, along with measures of Planned Productivity, PPC has been extensively researched but Planned Productivity has been neglected. Using a lean methodology based on location-based scheduling enables an alternative performance measurement system. This paper proposes a method which makes possible the gathering of large amounts of performance data without too much effort. The method is an important contribution to the available suite of lean methods. Performance measurement using location-based status data is a method which has much in common with earned value analysis, and is able to use the progressive performance through each location of the project as the unit of measurement. The equivalent indicator to PPC is provided by measuring against the planned completion of a location. Furthermore, before commencing work the site checks the <b>actual</b> <b>quantities</b> in each location. Planned Productivity is measured during implementation, with the start date and finish date, <b>actual</b> <b>quantities</b> and average resources used in each location being recorded. This information can be used to calculate actual productivity. The location-based data gives the ability to measure within tasks, revealing not just completion of stages as in PPC, can measure against Planned Productivity. The actual productivities can be used to forecast problems in the future and to evaluate the feasibility of alternative control actions. In addition, the location-based actual information combined with the original Bill-of-Quantities and schedule reveals the erroneous assumptions made during preplanning and facilitates learning on future projects.

The hills, which, as compared with living beings, seem [...] "everlasting," [...] are, in truth, as perishing as they: its veins of flowing fountain weary the mountain heart, as the crimson pulse does ours; the natural force of the iron crag is abated in its appointed time, like the strength of the sinews in a human old age; and it is but the lapse of the longer years of decay which, in the sight of its Creator, distinguishes the mountain range from the moth and the worm.|$|E

For in hitherto taking little cognizance of the limitation of thought by the structure of the body, we have surely also lost sight of the power of certain modes of thought over the processes of that structure. Taking, for instance, the emotion of anger, of which the cephalopoda are indeed as capable as we are, but inferior to us in being unable to decide whether they do well to be angry or not, I do not think the chemical effect of that emotion on the particles of the blood, in decomposing and otherwise paralyzing or debilitating them, has been sufficiently examined, nor the <b>actual</b> <b>quantity</b> of nervous energy which a fit of anger of given violence withdraws from the body and restores to space, neither the correlative power of volition in restraining the passion, or in directing the choice of salutary thought, as of salutary herbs on streams. And even we painters, who dare not call ourselves capable of thought, are capable of choice in more or less salutary vision. In the degree in which we lose such power of choice in vision, so that the spectral phenomena which are the materials of our industry present themselves under forms beyond our control, we become insane; and although for all our best work a certain degree of this insanity is necessary, and the first occurring conceptions are uncommanded, as in dreams, we have, when in health, always instantaneous power of accepting some, refusing others, perfecting the outlines and colors of those we wish to keep, and arranging them in such relations as we choose.|$|E

40|$|Performance {{measurement}} is {{an important}} component of lean-based management systems, however cost management systems or analysis have largely been applied at a high level and have not attempted to measure or model the production cost impacts of disruption on a lean project. While it is important to develop systems for practical site management, it is equally important to ensure that such systems can accommodate mainstream performance measurement systems. In this paper, the performance system known as Earned Value Analysis is adapted to a location-based method for planning and control-ling work known as flowline or line-of-balance. The resultant method for forecasting cash flow, modeling the costs of interference and controlling costs, is described. The method is compatible with location-based scheduling methods. It uses location-based quantities and their unit prices as starting data. Because the location-based quantities are also used in developing the flowline schedule, the start and finish date for each quantity is also known. This information can be used to calculate cash flow more accurately than previously. In the preplanning phase, quantity estimates and estimated prices are used to create a location-based cost estimate. During the production phase, more accurate quantity data is available and prices from contracts can be used directly to arrive at a first cost forecast, before commencing the work. When the work is being done, cost controlling can be done by surveying the <b>actual</b> <b>quantities</b> of each location. The cost forecast is then updated based on these <b>actual</b> <b>quantities</b> and using the contract prices. The location-based schedule forecast can be used to forecast overhead costs and to forecast costs of interference. The paper contributes to our understanding of monitoring and control in a flowline-based management system in a lean-construction methodology. It also demonstrates that effective location-based control of the payment system allows better management of sub-contractors during production. Peer reviewe...|$|R
