40|$|Sulphonated <b>anthraquinones</b> are {{precursors}} of many synthetic dyes and pigments, recalcitrant to biodegradation, {{and thus}} contaminating many industrial effluents and rivers. In {{the development of}} a phytotreatment to remove sulphonated aromatic compounds, rhubarb (Rheum rhaponticum), a plant producing natural <b>anthraquinones,</b> as well as maize (Zea mays) and celery (Apium graveolens), plants not producing <b>anthraquinones,</b> were tested for their ability to metabolise these xenobiotics. Plants were cultivated under hydroponic conditions, with or without sulphonated <b>anthraquinones,</b> and were harvested at different times. Either microsomal or cytosolic fractions were prepared. The monooxygenase activity of cytochromes P 450 towards several sulphonated <b>anthraquinones</b> was tested using a new method based on the fluorimetric detection of oxygen consumed during cytochromes P 450 -catalysed reactions. The activity of cytosolic peroxidases was measured by spectrophotometry, using guaiacol as a substrate. Results indicated that the activity of cytochromes P 450 and peroxidases significantly increased in rhubarb plants cultivated in the presence of sulphonated <b>anthraquinones.</b> A higher activity of cytochromes P 450 was also detected in maize and celery exposed to the pollutants. In these two plants, a peroxidase activity was also detected, but without a clear difference between the control plants and the plants exposed to the organic contaminants.

40|$|Sulphonated <b>anthraquinones</b> are {{precursors}} of many synthetic dyes and pigments, recalcitrant to biodegradation {{and thus}} not eliminated by classical wastewater treatments. In {{the development of}} a phytotreatment to remove sulphonated aromatic compounds from dye and textile industrial effluents, {{it has been shown that}} rhubarb (Rheum rabarbarum) and common sorrel (Rumex acetosa) are the most efficient plants. Both species, producing natural <b>anthraquinones,</b> not only accumulate, but also transform these xenobiotic chemicals. Even if the precise biochemical mechanisms involved in the detoxification of sulphonated <b>anthraquinones</b> are not yet understood, they probably have cross talks with secondary metabolism, redox processes and plant energy metabolism. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible roles of cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases and peroxidases in the detoxification of several sulphonated <b>anthraquinones.</b> Both plant species were cultivated in a greenhouse under hydroponic conditions, with or without sulphonated <b>anthraquinones.</b> Plants were harvested at different times and either microsomal or cytosolic fractions were prepared. The monooxygenase activity of cytochromes P 450 toward several sulphonated <b>anthraquinones</b> was tested using a new method based on the fluorimetric detection of oxygen consumed during cytochromes P 450 -catalysed reactions. The activity of cytosolic peroxidases was measured by spectrophotometry, using guaiacol as a substrate. A significant activity of cytochromes P 450 was detected in rhubarb leaves, while no (rhizome) or low (petioles and roots) activity was found in other parts of the plants. An induction of this enzyme was observed at the beginning of the exposition to sulphonated <b>anthraquinones.</b> The results also indicated that cytochromes P 450 were able to accept as substrate the five sulphonated <b>anthraquinones,</b> with a higher activity toward AQ- 2, 6 -SS (0. 706 nkat/mg protein) and AQ- 2 -S (0. 720 nkat/mg protein). An activity of the cytochromes P 450 was also found in the leaves of common sorrel (1. 212 nkat/mg protein (AQ- 2, 6 -SS)), but no induction of the activity occurred after the exposition to the pollutant. The activity of peroxidases increased when rhubarb was cultivated in the presence of the five sulphonated <b>anthraquinones</b> (0. 857 nkat/mg protein). Peroxidase activity was also detected in the leaves of the common sorrel (0. 055 nkat/mg protein), but in this plant, no significant difference was found between plants cultivated with and without sulphonated <b>anthraquinones.</b> Results indicated that the activity of cytochromes P 450 and peroxidases increased in rhubarb in the presence of sulphonated <b>anthraquinones</b> and were involved in their detoxification mechanisms. These results suggest the existence in rhubarb and common sorrel of specific mechanisms involved in the metabolism of sulphonated <b>anthraquinones.</b> Further investigation should be performed to find the next steps of this detoxification pathway. Besides these promising results for the phytotreatment of sulphonated <b>anthraquinones,</b> it will be of high interest to develop and test, at small scale, an experimental wastewater treatment system to determine its efficiency. On the other hand, these results reinforce the idea that natural biodiversity should be better studied to use the most appropriate species for the phytotreatment of a specific pollutant...|$|R

2500|$|Today, {{hydrogen}} peroxide is manufactured almost exclusively by the <b>anthraquinone</b> process, which was formalized in 1936 and patented in 1939.

2500|$|... 9,10-Anthraquinone {{is used as}} a {{digester}} additive {{in production}} of paper pulp by alkaline processes, like the Kraft, the alkaline sulfite or the Soda-AQ processes.
