40|$|International audienceCondition {{monitoring}} of gearboxes via vibration analysis is well-recognized approach in scientific literature {{and also in}} engineering practice. However, in many cases machine works under non-stationary operating conditions (load and speed variation), that often requires special signal processing and pattern recognition suitable for time varying systems. One of key problem is to identify variation of external load or speed. Measurement of current consumed by electric motor or instantaneous speed obtained by processing of tachometer signal, in many practical situations (industrial condition) may be difficult or impossible. In such case non-stationary load variation may be identified by extraction of information hidden in vibration signal. For example it may be extracted from <b>amplitude</b> or frequency <b>demodulation.</b> Unfortunately both approaches are difficult (or even impossible) for our machines due to complexity of design and wide range of load/speed variation.

The topic is not only of academic interest since the achievements {{that can be made}} by successful machine condition monitoring in the industry. It has a potential value that is close to be absurd, for example unplanned production stops is commonly known {{to be one of the}} worst nightmares for manufacturing companies and if one can detect faults in early stages one can improve the possibilityto plan a production stop and therefore increase the profit. Four demodulation algorithms were developed and implemented in MATLAB on data characterized by close to stationarity and distinctive energy centered around the harmonics of the gearmesh frequency.  The resulting algorithms for narrowband phase and <b>amplitude</b> <b>demodulation</b> was shown to outperform Hilbert transform based phase and <b>amplitude</b> <b>demodulation</b> algorithms in gearbox diagnostics.

Experimental work was carried out on a test-rig and both local and distributed faults were introduced to two gearboxes, one kind of fault per gearbox. However, the data acquired from the test-rig showed severe non-stationarity and smeared spectrum properties even when angular resampling was performed and therefore a major drawback of the demodulation techniques was exploited since the methods for demodulation in this thesis are not applicable for signals with smeared spectrums.

40|$|Planetary gearbox {{vibration}} signals {{have strong}} modulation features {{due to the}} amplitude modulation and frequency modulation (AM-FM) effect of gear faults, {{as well as the}} amplitude modulation (AM) effect of time-varying vibration transfer paths, on gear meshing vibrations. This results in an involute sidebands structure in Fourier spectrum, possibly misleading fault diagnosis. The modulating frequency of both amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM) parts is closely related to the gear fault characteristic frequency. This inspires the idea of joint <b>amplitude</b> and frequency <b>demodulation</b> analysis, thus addressing the complex sidebands issue inherent in Fourier spectrum. Demodulation analysis requires mono-component signals for accurate estimation of instantaneous frequency, and proper selection of an AM-FM component sensitive to gear fault. To this end, we firstly decompose the complex signal into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) via variational mode decomposition (VMD), by exploiting its capability in decomposing complex modulated signal into constituent AM-FM components. For effective application of VMD in complex planetary gearbox signal analysis, we propose a method to determine a key parameter in VMD, i. e. the number of IMFs to be separated. For accurate instantaneous frequency estimation, we decompose IMFs via empirical AM-FM decomposition, to remove the influence of AM on instantaneous frequency estimation. Then, we select the sensitive IMF that contains the main gear fault information for further demodulation analysis. In order to properly select the sensitive IMF, we propose a criterion based on the gear vibration characteristics and the VMD properties. Finally, we obtain the amplitude and frequency demodulated spectra by applying Fourier transform to the amplitude envelope and instantaneous frequency of the selected sensitive IMF. According to the characteristics exhibited in the demodulated spectra, we can detect planetary gearbox fault. The proposed method is illustrated via a numerical simulated planetary gearbox vibration signal, and is further validated using lab experimental vibration signals of a planetary gearbox.

However, the requirement of the vibration measurement at number of locations in structures, machines and/or equipments makes the vibration measurement exorbitant if conventional piezoelectric accelerometers are used. Hence, {{there is a need}} for cheaper and reliable alternative for the conventional accelerometers. The Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) accelerometers are one such cheap alternative. However, a significant deviation in the performance of the MEMS accelerometers has been observed in earlier research studies and also confirmed by this presented study when compared with well known conventional accelerometer. Therefore, two methods have been suggested to improve the performance of the existing MEMS accelerometers; one for correction in time domain and other in frequency domain. Both methods are based on the generation of a characteristic function (CF) for the MEMS accelerometer using well known reference accelerometer in laboratory tests. The procedures of both methods have been discussed and validations of these methods have been presented through experimental examples. In addition, a Finite Element (FE) model of a typical MEMS accelerometer has been developed and modal analysis has been carried out to understand the dynamics of capacitive type MEMS accelerometer and to identify the source of errors. It has been observed that the moving fingers behave like a cantilever beam while the fixed fingers showed rigid body motion. This cantilever type of motion seems to be causing non-parallel plates effect in the formed capacitors between moving and fixed fingers which results in errors in the vibration measurement. Hence, design modifications on finger shape have been suggested to remove the cantilever motion and results showed remarkable improvement. Moreover, the effect of using synchronous <b>amplitude</b> modulation and <b>demodulation</b> in the readout circuit has been studied.

40|$|The {{penetration}} of wind power has increased greatly {{over the last}} decade in the United States and across the world. The U. S. wind power industry installed 1, 118 MW of new capacity {{in the first quarter of}} 2011 alone and entered the second quarter with another 5, 600 MW under construction. By 2030, wind energy is expected to provide 20 % of the U. S. electricity needs. As the number of wind turbines continues to grow, the need for effective condition monitoring and fault detection (CMFD) systems becomes increasingly important [3]. Online CMFD is an effective means of not only improving the reliability, capacity factor, and lifetime, but it also reduces the downtime, energy loss, and operation and maintenance (O&M) of wind turbines. The goal of this project is to develop novel online nonintrusive CMFD technologies for wind turbines. The proposed technologies use only the current measurements that have been used by the control and protection system of a wind turbine generator (WTG); no additional sensors or data acquisition devices are needed. Current signals are reliable and easily accessible from the ground without intruding on the wind turbine generators (WTGs) that are situated on high towers and installed in remote areas. Therefore, current-based CMFD techniques have great economic benefits and the potential to be adopted by the wind energy industry. Specifically, the following objectives and results have been achieved in this project: (1) Analyzed the effects of faults in a WTG on the generator currents of the WTG operating at variable rotating speed conditions from the perspective of amplitude and frequency modulations of the current measurements; (2) Developed effective <b>amplitude</b> and frequency <b>demodulation</b> methods for appropriate signal conditioning of the current measurements to improve the accuracy and reliability of wind turbine CMFD; (3) Developed a 1 P-invariant power spectrum density (PSD) method for effective signature extraction of wind turbine faults with characteristic frequencies in the current or current demodulated signals, where 1 P stands for the shaft rotating frequency of a WTG; (4) Developed a wavelet filter for effective signature extraction of wind turbine faults without characteristic frequencies in the current or current demodulated signals; (5) Developed an effective adaptive noise cancellation method as an alternative to the wavelet filter method for signature extraction of wind turbine faults without characteristic frequencies in the current or current demodulated signals; (6) Developed a statistical analysis-based impulse detection method for effective fault signature extraction and evaluation of WTGs based on the 1 P-invariant PSD of the current or current demodulated signals; (7) Validated the proposed current-based wind turbine CMFD technologies through extensive computer simulations and experiments for small direct-drive WTGs without gearboxes; and (8) Showed, through extensive experiments for small direct-drive WTGs, that the performance of the proposed current-based wind turbine CMFD technologies is comparable to traditional vibration-based methods. The proposed technologies have been successfully applied for detection of major failures in blades, shafts, bearings, and generators of small direct-drive WTGs. The proposed technologies can be easily integrated into existing wind turbine control, protection, and monitoring systems and can be implemented remotely from the wind turbines being monitored. The proposed technologies provide an alternative to vibration-sensor-based CMFD. This will reduce the cost and hardware complexity of wind turbine CMFD systems. The proposed technologies can also be combined with vibration-sensor-based methods to improve the accuracy and reliability of wind turbine CMFD systems. When there are problems with sensors, the proposed technologies will ensure proper CMFD for the wind turbines, including their sensing systems. In conclusion, the proposed technologies offer an effective means to achieve condition-based smart maintenance for wind turbines and have a great potential to be adopted by the wind energy industry due to their almost no-cost, nonintrusive features. Although only validated for small direct-drive wind turbines without gearboxes, the proposed technologies are also applicable for CMFD of large-size wind turbines with and without gearboxes. However, additional investigations are recommended in order to apply the proposed technologies to those large-size wind turbines...|$|R

In-phase and quadrature coding schemes are presented with band structures and anti-aliasing constraints for auto- and heteroassociative memory formation and recall. Simulation results are provided that show the accuracy of recall for various Butterworth and Chebyshev filters...|$|E
40|$|Bearing faults {{account for}} {{a large portion of}} all faults in wind turbine {{generators}} (WTGs). Current-based bearing fault diagnosis techniques have great economic benefits and are potential to be adopted by the wind energy industry. This paper models the modulation effects of bearing faults on the stator currents of a direct-drive wind turbine equipped with a permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) operating with a variable shaft rotating frequency. Based on the analysis, a method consisting of appropriate current frequency and <b>amplitude</b> <b>demodulation</b> algorithms and a 1 P-invariant power spectrum density algorithm is proposed for bearing fault diagnosis of variable-speed direct-drive wind turbines using only one-phase stator current measurements, where 1 P frequency stands for the shaft rotating frequency of a wind turbine. Experimental results on a direct-drive wind turbine equipped with a PMSG operating in a wind tunnel are provided to verify the proposed fault diagnosis method. The proposed method is demonstrated to have advantages over the method of directly using stator current measurements for WTG bearing fault diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Amplitude</b> <b>demodulation</b> {{is a key}} for {{diagnosing}} bearing faults. The {{quality of}} the demodulation determines {{the efficiency of the}} spectrum analysis in detecting the defect. A signal analysis technique based on minimum entropy deconvolution (MED), empirical mode decomposition (EMD), and Teager Kaiser energy operator (TKEO) is presented. The proposed method consists in enhancing the signal by using MED, decomposing the signal in intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and selects only the IMF which presents the highest correlation coefficient with the original signal. In this study the first IMF 1 was automatically selected, since it represents the contribution of high frequencies which are first excited at the early stages of degradation. After that, TKEO is used to track the modulation energy. The spectrum is applied to the instantaneous amplitude. Therefore, the character of the bearing faults can be recognized according to the envelope spectrum. The simulation and experimental results show that an envelope spectrum analysis based on MED-EMD and TKEO provides a reliable signal analysis tool. The experimental application has been developed on acoustic emission and vibration signals recorded for bearing fault detection...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Demodulation is an ill-posed problem {{whenever}} both {{carrier and}} envelope signals are broadband and unknown. Here, we approach this problem using {{the methods of}} probabilistic inference. The new approach, called Probabilistic <b>Amplitude</b> <b>Demodulation</b> (PAD), is computationally challenging but improves on existing methods {{in a number of}} ways. By contrast to previous approaches to demodulation, it satisfies five key desiderata: PAD has soft constraints because it is probabilistic; PAD is able to automatically adjust to the signal because it learns parameters; PAD is user-steerable because the solution can be shaped by user-specific prior information; PAD is robust to broad-band noise because this is modelled explicitly; and PAD’s solution is self-consistent, empirically satisfying a Carrier Identity property. Furthermore, the probabilistic view naturally encompasses noise and uncertainty, allowing PAD to cope with missing data and return error bars on carrier and envelope estimates. Finally, we show that when PAD is applied to a bandpass-filtered signal, the stop-band energy of the inferred carrier is minimal, making PAD well-suited to sub-band demodulation.
