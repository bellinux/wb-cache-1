5|$|<b>A</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> antiretrovirals {{administered}} within 48 to 72hours {{after exposure}} to HIV-positive blood or genital secretions {{is referred to}} as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). The use of the single agent zidovudine reduces the risk of a HIV infection five-fold following a needle-stick injury. As of 2013, the prevention regimen recommended in the United States consists of three medications—tenofovir, emtricitabine and raltegravir—as this may reduce the risk further.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> {{brachytherapy}} can {{be completed}} {{in less time than}} other radiotherapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance for surviving cancer-cells to divide and grow in the intervals between each radiotherapy dose. Patients typically have to make fewer visits to the radiotherapy clinic compared with EBRT, and may receive the treatment as outpatients. This makes treatment accessible and convenient for many patients. These features of brachytherapy mean that most patients are able to tolerate the brachytherapy procedure very well.|$|E

The Ashland Board of Education was to provide the buildings, land, equipment and facilities. All other expenses, including teacher salaries were to be paid by the University of Kentucky.|$|E

Following {{two years at}} Osborne College, {{which he did not}} enjoy, Edward moved on to the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth. <b>A</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> two years, followed by entry into the Royal Navy, was planned.

After the October Revolution, Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin's government announced that minorities in the empire could pursue <b>a</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> self-determination. Following the collapse of the empire, in May 1918 Armenia, and its neighbors Azerbaijan and Georgia, declared their independence from Russian rule and each established their respective republics. After the near-annihilation of the Armenians during the Armenian Genocide and the subsequent Turkish-Armenian War, the historic Armenian area in the Ottoman Empire was overrun with despair and devastation.|$|E

He was prescribed <b>a</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> antidepressants, but felt uncomfortable and embarrassed about taking them, and tried {{to hide the fact}} from his friends. He knew enough about drugs to worry about their side effects, and was concerned about how they would react with his regular cannabis use.|$|E
5|$|His {{increasing}} interest in mineralogy {{at this time}} is also apparent from the titles of two books he authored between 1803 and 1809. The first was a two volume work that appeared in 1804 entitled A Practical Essay on the Analysis of Minerals, which was reissued in 1808 as A Manual of Analytical Mineralogy. In 1809 he published Analysis of <b>a</b> <b>Course</b> <b>of</b> Lectures on Mineralogy.

5|$|In 1729, the Royal Naval Academy in Portsmouth– {{renamed the}} Royal Naval College in 1806– was founded, for 40students aged between 13 and 16, {{who would take}} three years to {{complete}} <b>a</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> study defined in an illustrated book, and would earn two years of sea time {{as part of their}} studies. The rating of midshipman-by-order, or midshipman ordinary, was used specifically for graduates of the Royal Naval College, to distinguish them from midshipmen who had served aboard ship, who were paid more. The school was unpopular in the Navy, because officers enjoyed the privilege of having servants and preferred the traditional method of training officers via apprenticeship.|$|E

40|$|A {{protocol}} {{of treatment}} for acute haematogenous osteomyelitis has been evaluated in 75 children. Intravenous cloxadillin and benzylpenicillin were given in hospital until the child had improved after which oral antibiotics and immobilisation were continued at home for a total ofsix weeks. Oral cloxacillin was used most frequently as Staphylococcus aureus was the major pathogen. Simple drainage of subperiosteal pus {{was carried out in}} the 17 children with clinical evidence of an abscess. Ninety-two per cent ofthe 55 children with acute osteomyelitis diagnosed early were cured by <b>a</b> single <b>course</b> <b>of</b> antibiotics without <b>an</b> operation and with less than one week in hospital. Only 25 per cent of the 12 children with late-diagnosed acute osteomyelitis were cured with <b>a</b> single <b>course</b> <b>of</b> antibiotics and <b>an</b> operation.

5|$|Meth {{mouth is}} very {{difficult}} to treat unless the patient stops using methamphetamine; persistent drug use makes changes in hygiene or nutrition practices unlikely. Many drug users lack access to dental treatment, and few are willing to participate in such <b>a</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> action, often because of poverty. Those who are willing to seek dental treatment often resist discussing their drug use. Providing dental treatment to individuals who use methamphetamine can also be dangerous, because the potential combination of local anesthetic and methamphetamine can cause serious heart problems. There is also an increased risk of serious side effects if opioid medications are used in the patient's treatment.|$|E
5|$|Perfect Dark was {{developed}} over <b>a</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> {{nearly a year}} and its game engine was completely re-written from scratch to support several Xbox 360 features. Therefore, although the game plays {{exactly the same as}} the original, the code and renderer is different. The game received generally favorable reviews. Some critics considered the relatively unchanged game to be outdated, but most agreed that the title was a solid revival of a classic. As of the end of 2011, the game had sold nearly 410,000 units. In 2015, the game was included in the Rare Replay video game compilation for Xbox One.|$|E

5|$|The two {{predecessor}} {{theories to}} two-level utilitarianism, act and rule utilitarianism, were beset by various objections. For example, rule utilitarianism {{was criticized for}} implying {{that in some cases}} an individual should pursue <b>a</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> action that would obviously not maximise utility. Conversely, act utilitarianism was criticized for not allowing for a 'human element' in its calculations, i.e. it is sometimes too difficult (or impossible) for an ordinary person.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{advancement}} of his legal career had been hindered by his marriage to Jane, Hogg hoped to receive a legal appointment from a politically connected acquaintance.

Hogg embarked on <b>a</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> study in preparation, but the professorship was not established owing to a lack of funds.
