5|$|Although few strongholds in the {{northeast}} remained unconquered and in Christian hands, the fall of Taormina marked the effective end of Byzantine Sicily, and the consolidation of Muslim control over the island. However, it did not signal the end of Arab–Byzantine warfare on and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>island.</b>|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the land}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> had been {{partially}} reclaimed, allowing easier access. A police officer for the island was appointed in 1844 and a school was opened in 1871.|$|E
5|$|Tasmanian forms {{have been}} shown to be frost {{tolerant}} at any time of year, which might explain some of their success in spreading and growing in different habitats <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>island.</b> This attribute might have allowed them to survive cold periods in Tasmania in the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|The Witness is a 3D puzzle {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Thekla, Inc. It was released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 in January 2016, and later for Xbox One, Nvidia Shield, macOS, and iOS. Inspired by Myst, the game involves the exploration of an open world island filled with natural and man-made structures. The player progresses by solving puzzles, {{which are based on}} interactions with mazes presented on panels <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> or hidden within the environment. The player will have to determine the rules of each puzzle from visual clues and audio recordings scattered <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>island.</b>|$|E

5|$|The action {{takes place}} on and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Ithaca, {{ten years after the}} Trojan Wars. English {{translations}} used in the synopsis are from Geoffrey Dunn's version, based on Raymond Leppard's 1971 edition, and from Hugh Ward-Perkins's interpretation issued with Sergio Vartolo's 2006 recording for Brilliant Classics.|$|E
5|$|The treacherous {{conditions}} for ships <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> led to several shipwrecks. The British passenger vessel Tapley lost seven passengers {{when it became}} stranded on Flat Holm in January 1773 on its passage from Cork, Ireland to Bristol.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Beta reached Providencia Island, on October 29, 2005. Rainfall {{from the}} storm were {{estimated}} over 12in (304mm). Roofs were damaged all over the island, and the island's main communications tower was knocked over. A total of 1,660 homes were damaged by the storm throughout the island, leaving 1.4millionColombian peso (2005COP; $681USD) in repair costs. This disrupted fixed-line telephone service and as the island has no cellular telephone service, it caused a total cessation of communication with the mainland. Beta's arrival on the island {{was accompanied by a}} seven-foot storm surge, which damaged beaches, coastal houses and roads, and washed out a tourist footbridge. Coral reefs <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> were, for the most part, untouched, as only 1percent of the coral sustained minor damage. Minor effects were also found around areas of sea grass. Beaches all <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> lost an average of 9.8ft (3m) of sand due to erosion. Thirty people were injured and 913 families, a total of 3,074 people, were affected during Hurricane Beta's passage over the island.|$|E
50|$|During the First World War, {{members of}} the Volunteers were mobilised to man {{military}} outposts <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Islands,</b> while 36 Falklanders enlisted in the armed forces. At {{the end of the}} war, <b>the</b> Falkland <b>Islands</b> Volunteers was renamed as <b>the</b> Falkland <b>Islands</b> Defence Force. <b>The</b> FIDF was mobilised again during the Second World War, manning defensive outposts <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Islands.</b> At this time, a mounted rifles unit was raised.|$|R

5|$|Installation of {{military}} communications equipment {{and plans to}} reclaim land. Malaysia alleged that Singapore's installation {{of military}} communications equipment on Pedra Branca was done secretly, {{and that it had}} only learned about this when it received Singapore's memorial in the case. As regards Singapore's plans to reclaim land <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> Malaysia said it could not have reacted to some of the documents as they had been secret.|$|E
5|$|Lake Shore Road <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> {{was built}} between 1900 and 1910 by the state, and the M-185 {{designation}} was first assigned on July 12, 1933. The roadway was purpose-built for non-motorized use; it is narrower than other state highways. During the 1950s, the state paved {{the road in}} asphalt. Since the 1970s, the MISPC has allowed snowmobiles to operate on Mackinac Island during the winter.|$|E
5|$|Another similar rags-to-riches {{story is}} Pang Lim, {{who was an}} illegal fruit hawker in Sungei Road in the 1970s. His big break came when he saved enough money to rent a coffee shop in 1990 with his younger brother and uncle. They rented the stalls out to other hawkers and managed the drinks stall themselves. The {{business}} took off and from one coffee shop, Pang is now the managing director of Koufu, which operates 20 foodcourts, five coffee shops and five cafes <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>island.</b>|$|E

5|$|At 23:00 on 30 March, with {{a strong}} wind from the south, Guillaume Tell sailed from Valletta, Decrés hoping to use the cover of {{darkness}} to escape the British blockade. Dixon had deployed his ships <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> with Valletta watched by the frigate HMS Penelope under Captain Henry Blackwood. At 23:55, Blackwood's lookouts spotted Guillaume Tell and the captain gave chase, ordering the brig HMS Minorca under Commander George Miller to convey the message to Dixon, whose ships were just visible in the distance. Blackwood also attempted to signal his discovery to his commanding officer as Penelope gave chase.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{has shown}} a number of fish traps exist <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> which date from around the 7th century. The Anglo-Saxons {{established}} a large fish weir at Besom Fleet to the southwest of the island and built the church at West Mersea. It was damaged by Norse raiders in 894 and rebuilt afterwards. The west tower {{was added to the}} church around the 11th century, the south aisle in the 15th and various other rebuilds continued {{towards the end of the}} 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Forest covers about 12.6% of the country, {{most of it}} {{designated}} for commercial production. Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates. Remnants of native forest can be found scattered <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> in particular in the Killarney National Park. Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas. Grazing in this manner {{is one of the}} main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country.|$|E

5|$|Historically, migratory whales such as blue, fin, sei {{were very}} {{abundant}} in the island waters, but were severely reduced in numbers to near-extinction by commercial and illegal hunts including the mass illegal hunts by Soviet Union and Japan in 1960s to 1970s. Southern right and sperm were most severely hunted among these, hence the area was called the Middle Ground by whalers. It is likely that these two were once seasonal residents <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> where right whales prefer sheltered, very shallow bays while sperm whales mainly inhabit deep waters.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, the USFWS {{relocated}} about 140 Californian sea otters to San Nicolas Island (SNI) in southern California, {{in the hope}} of establishing a reserve population should the mainland be struck by an oil spill. To the surprise of biologists, the San Nicolas sea otters mostly swam back to the mainland. By 2005, only 30 sea otters remained at San Nicolas, although they were slowly increasing as they thrived on the abundant prey <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>island.</b> The plan that authorized the translocation program had predicted the carrying capacity would be reached within five to 10 years. The spring 2016 SNI count was 104 sea otters, continuing a 5-year positive trend of over 12% per year.|$|E
5|$|Papa Stour {{is one of}} the Shetland Islands in Scotland, with a {{population}} of under twenty people, some of whom immigrated after an appeal for residents in the 1970s. Located to the west of mainland Shetland and with an area of 828hectares (3.2square miles), Papa Stour is the eighth largest island in Shetland. Erosion of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves, stacks, arches, blowholes, and cliffs. The island and its surrounding seas harbour diverse populations of wildlife. The west side of the island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the seas <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> are a Special Area of Conservation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> were often visited by sealers, {{to the extent}} that the seals had been nearly exterminated by 1835. Subsequently, whaling was <b>the</b> main {{activity}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands,</b> especially by <b>the</b> whalers from Massachusetts. In 1841 there were a dozen whaleships <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands.</b> Within a couple of years this had increased to twenty from the United States alone. Such exploitation was short-lived, and <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> were rarely visited for the rest of the century.|$|R
