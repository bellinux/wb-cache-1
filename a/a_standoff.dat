Thorpe's difficulties heightened at the subsequent German leg of the tour in Berlin, when <b>a</b> <b>standoff</b> over a drug-test arose when officials wanted to take an unsealed sample {{due to lack of}} containers. After the standoff was resolved, Thorpe proceeded to cut more than 1.5s from his world short course record in the 200m freestyle.
