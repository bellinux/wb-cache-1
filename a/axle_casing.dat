50|$|Four {{wheel drive}} for heavy {{vehicles}} {{in this period}} was difficult and the Hathi used a complex arrangement of bevel gears to transmit drive through the steering joints of the front axle. Rather than the common system of articulated drive shafts to the front hubs (the shaft either inside an <b>axle</b> <b>casing</b> or external), fixed shafts were used. Shafts inside the <b>axle</b> <b>casing</b> carried power {{to the ends of}} the axle, then a bevel gear drove a short vertical shaft running through the steering kingpin. A further bevel on the outer part of the hub carrier (the part moving with the steering) drove the hub itself.|$|E
50|$|In 1957, the {{lightweight}} Goggomobil used a similar suspension design to the Scarab. Much simpler though, the Goggomobil had bare drive shafts that also acted as the suspension links, with suspension forces {{passing through the}} inboard Hooke joints. The swing axle shafts were only carried by the trailing radius rods, rather than an <b>axle</b> <b>casing,</b> and the long struts were shortened to a simple coilover shock absorber.|$|E
50|$|The clutch runs in oil {{and uses}} the metal to metal {{gripping}} disc system of the 8 hp car. Drive {{was taken to the}} rear wheels through a three-speed gearbox, light but very similar to the earlier car, and jointed drive shaft. The brake drum {{at the back of the}} gearbox surrounds the universal joint, the rear <b>axle</b> <b>casing</b> extends forward to almost the universal joint. There is a bevel wheel in the differential case.|$|E
50|$|The {{constant}} velocity joint used to make modern articulated drive shafts was unheard of as yet and even the simpler Hooke-type universal joint wasn't yet in common use. Thornycroft's usual practice for prop shafts {{at the time was}} to use a flexible leather disk joint. To save weight, the <b>axle</b> <b>casings</b> were cast in aluminium.|$|R
50|$|The company's {{four-wheel-drive}} tractors {{with equal}} sized wheels by fitting a driven front axle running from output from a sandwich plate between the gearbox and rear <b>axle</b> <b>casings.</b> Because {{of the size}} of the axle this meant the whole tractor was raised considerably from standard height. However the traction gains were considerable (as with County and Roadless tractors) and Muir-Hills have been and are used for heavy draught applications.|$|R
5000|$|The design's origin {{lies with}} William Stout's 1932 Stout Scarab. This rear-engined car used swing axle {{independent}} rear suspension, with long near-vertical coilover struts from high mounting {{points on the}} space frame chassis. Stout had also been an aircraft designer and considered that the long-travel oleo struts made, [...] 'the airplane landing gear is the easiest type of running gear for comfort yet devised.' [...] The lower ends of the struts were attached to the swing <b>axle</b> <b>casings</b> by swivel bushes. Forward radius rods handled the longitudinal forces.|$|R
50|$|The {{rear wheels}} were driven through a Hotchkiss drive system {{modified}} with control arms linking the rear <b>axle</b> <b>casing</b> to pivot {{points on the}} frame located directly above the true pivot of the leaf springs. These arms controlled the lateral movement of the rear axle without distorting the normal action of the springs, and allowed freedom in the vertical and longitudinal directions. Final drive was by hypoid gears, replacing the worm drive {{that had been used}} on final drives in Daimler cars since 1910. The rear track was 63 in wide. Tyres were 8.00 x 17 all around.|$|E
5000|$|The First World War {{brought about}} large scale growth, {{providing}} axles for military vehicles and by 1930 most lorries and buses {{made in the}} UK had a Kirkstall back <b>axle</b> <b>casing.</b> In 2002 {{the owners of the}} site, the Dana announced the closure of the works, shifting production to India and Spain. [...] The site is undergoing major redevelopment, as is the old Waide's Printers & Kwik Save site. Printing has, like iron-founding, suffered a decline, several printing companies remain. Until the late 1970s when it was closed, Kirkstall was dominated by a coal fired power station. It was replaced by larger power stations away from town at Ferrybridge, Eggborough and Drax. The power station was demolished in the early 1980s.|$|E
50|$|The chassis was {{suspended}} from the front axle at just one point by a pivoted transverse leaf spring which made no contribution to transverse stability and the whole car rested on just three points. Radius rods from the gearbox take up braking strains and act as distance stays for the back axle. The front end of these stays have buffer springs The foot brake is the contracting band type, the hand brake is of the pull-on internal expanding type. Both sets of brake are metal to metal. The action of the engine brake avoids much use of the conventional braking system. The rear springs attach {{by means of a}} spherical case clipping over a spherical turned part of the <b>axle</b> <b>casing</b> thus allowing a little motion due to bumps.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Usually {{the gearbox}} casing of twin screw pulping {{extruder}} {{was designed by}} experience and greater weight. In {{order to reduce the}} casing weight under the premise of ensuring its stiffness and strength, firstly the casting lower box and the weakest <b>axle</b> in the <b>casing</b> were analyzed with finite element method by ANSYS software. And then the optimum design was carried out to take the minimum volume as an objective function. Finally, the welding casing has been designed as considering the manufacturing cost. The results show that the weight of the casting lower box after optimization is 22. 95 % lower than that of the experience design, and the weight of the welding part is 19. 09 % lower than that. The work has certain significance for optimum design of gearbox casing...|$|R
40|$|The {{methodology}} of measuring the vibration signal recorded on the casing of wheeled armoured vehicle ROSOMAK driving axis is presented. The study {{was performed on}} a test bench for different transmission conditions. A preliminary analysis of the frequency spectra vibration signals recorded. The test stand allows investigation of the differential axle gears under load similar to load during duty operation. It was possible by using the combustion engine and gearboxes and load transmission by using the dynamometer break. Have been described. Three methods of attaching acceleration sensors to differential gears: using screws, magnetic washers and probe handle. The results of comparisons of measurement results obtained using these methods. Finally, the sensors was mount by using the screw connections. Selected positions and points of temperature and vibration measures were described. Values of characteristic frequencies of differential axle gears vibration by moving the drive torque through these boxes were calculated. The spectra of the vibration signal determined during testing gearboxes were shown. It was state that of amplitude-frequency vibration spectra of signals recorded at selected points of differential <b>axle</b> gears <b>casing</b> are clearly visible characteristic frequencies but the vibration the bridge gear unit bridges distorted by vibration of {{the internal combustion engine}} and gearboxes. In a further stage of research should be included much larger number of the driving axis differentials investigated in various states of well-known technical conditions and should be lea...|$|R
50|$|Kirkstall was {{historically}} {{an important}} centre of industry. Kirkstall Forge lays claim {{to being the}} longest continually used industrial site in Britain founded in the 13th century by the Cistercian monks of the abbey, {{and a number of}} printers. The earliest known activity on the site was a medieval mill race which supplied water to power the corn mill at Kirkstall Abbey. Iron production took place at the forge from the 1580s onwards. During the late 18th century the reconstruction of the upper and lower forges allowed 'shovel and spade production' to commence. A railway was built at the forge in 1830 and sustained growth at the plant. The First World War brought about large scale growth, providing axles for military vehicles and by 1930 most lorries and buses made in the UK had a Kirkstall back <b>axle</b> <b>casing.</b> In 2002 the owners of the site, the Dana Holding Corporation announced the closure of the works, shifting production to India and Spain. The site is undergoing major redevelopment, as is the old Waide's Printers & Kwik Save site. Printing has, like iron-founding, suffered a decline, several printing companies remain.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{design of}} {{structural}} modeling is usually {{based on the}} different geometric function. Since every component has a definite life span, {{it is necessary to}} calculate its core parameters. To find the life span of component, the component must be as input parameter to the Finite Element Analysis. The Finite Element Analysis is nothing but a numerical method for solving Engineering and Mathematical problems. The Analysis of the “Rear <b>Axle</b> <b>Casing</b> of Tractor ” using cast iron material with special grade “SG 500 ” for already existing model, taken in the real time is done by using “ANSYS”. The stress, strain, deformation analysis of the component is done by giving various boundary conditions. These analyzed results help to redesign the rear casing of tractor. The redesigning of rear <b>axle</b> <b>casing</b> of a tractor is done using “PRO/E”. During redesigning the component, various criteria’s which are undergoing in the real field must be taken into an account. The analysis of the redesigned model is done by giving various boundary conditions for both materials ‘SG 500 ” and “SG 200 ”. Then the stress, strain, deformation, structural supports, structural results are evaluated and also cores, dies and patterns are generated and hence the redesigned rear <b>axle</b> <b>casing</b> of tractor is found to be in safer mode. The better material which is suitable for the rear <b>axle</b> <b>casing</b> is given, by comparing the above mentioned materials. INTRODUCTION OF TRACTOR The word tractor originated from the Latin word “trahere”, meaning pull. Today, tractors are used for drawing in, towing or pulling objects that are extremely hard to move. The tractor on farms which is used to push agricultural machineries or trailers that plough or harrow fields...|$|E
