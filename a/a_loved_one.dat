5|$|Funerals {{among the}} Antankarana are often celebratory events. Among villagers living near the sea, {{it is not}} {{uncommon}} for the remains of <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> to be placed in a coffin which the family carries running into the sea.|$|E
5|$|Without {{speaking}} directly of death, both verses {{indicate the}} absence of <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one,</b> and the narrator's sadness and inability {{to cope with the}} grief. In the second verse, the narrator cannot bring himself to come near to his lost love's grave. The effort to avoid the subject of death and the focus on fond memories is typical of songs and societal sensibilities at the time.|$|E
5|$|For most girls, {{childhood}} {{came to an}} {{end with}} the onset of puberty, which was followed shortly after by betrothal and marriage. Although marriage arranged by the family was the norm, romantic love was not unknown. Most women bore many children but few survived infancy, and grief for the loss of <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> was an inalienable part of life. The main form of birth control was abstinence, and while there is evidence of contraception it seems to have been mainly used by prostitutes.|$|E

5|$|It {{was common}} to leave gifts with the deceased. Both {{men and women}} {{received}} grave goods, even if the corpse was to be burnt on a pyre. A Norseman could also be buried with <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> or house thrall, or cremated together on a funeral pyre. The amount {{and the value of}} the goods depended on which social group the dead person came from. It was important to bury the dead in the right way so that he could join the afterlife with the same social standing that he had had in life, and to avoid becoming a homeless soul that wandered eternally.|$|E
5|$|The average SPAR {{officer was}} 29 years old, single, a college graduate, and had worked {{seven years in}} a {{professional}} or managerial position (in education or government) before entering the service. The average enlisted SPAR was 24 years old, single, a high school graduate, and had worked for over {{three years in a}} clerical or sales job before joining the service. The likelihood was that she came from the state of Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, or California. The reasons for becoming a SPAR differed, but most likely it was patriotism, self-advancement, desire for travel and adventure, or the loss of <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> in the war.|$|E
5|$|Ucu's first {{documentary}} was Pramoedya: Last Chapter. In 2005, Ucu {{made the}} 28-minute documentary Death in Jakarta. This film, {{dealing with the}} experiences of poor people after <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> dies in Jakarta, was inspired by her observations when passing Utan Kayu Public Cemetery in Utan Kayu, East Jakarta. It was produced after becoming one of four finalists in the Jakarta International Film Festival Script Development Competition. Ucu received Rp. 25 million (US$ 3,000) in prize money and was lent a camera by the competition; it was her first time using a professional-grade camera. In April of that year she released Kalau Kanakar (If Kalakar?), a short story collection.|$|E

Frustrated by his {{continued}} failures to excel, he retreats to London to spare his own life, but discovers that the Mimics will attack there after defeating the UDF in France. Eventually receiving {{a vision of a}} dam in Germany, indicating that the Omega is hiding there, Cage and Vrataski spend many loops figuring out how to escape the invasion and reach the dam. Cage comes to know Vrataski and falls in love with her, but Vrataski, who lost <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> to the Mimics, is only interested in the mission. Upon reaching a point where she is killed whatever they do, Cage decides to fly to the dam on his own. Inside the dam, he is ambushed by an Alpha and Mimic struggling to bleed him out and strip off his ability to reset time. Before they can slowly bleed him to death, Cage deliberately drowns himself to avoid the process.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the film's original score was composed by Raymond Wong and performed by the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra. The score imitates traditional Chinese music used in 1940s swordplay films. One of Wong's works, Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained, provides a stark contrast between the villainous Axe Gang and the peaceful neighbourhood of Pig Sty Alley, depicted by a Chinese folk song, Fisherman's Song of the East China Sea. Along with Wong's compositions and various traditional Chinese songs, classical compositions are featured in the score, including excerpts from Zigeunerweisen by Pablo de Sarasate and Sabre Dance by Aram Khachaturian. The song, Zhiyao Weini Huo Yitian (只要為你活一天; Only Want to Live One Day for You), is sung in the background by Eva Huang {{at the end of}} the film. Written by Liu Chia-chang (劉家昌) in the 1970s, it tells of a girl's memories of <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one,</b> and her desire to live for him again. Kung Fu Hustle was nominated for Best Original Film Score at the 24th Hong Kong Film Awards.|$|E

25|$|Traumatic grief or {{complicated}} mourning are conditions {{where both}} trauma and grief coincide. There are conceptual links between trauma and bereavement since loss of <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> is inherently traumatic. If a traumatic event was life-threatening, {{but did not}} result in death, then {{it is more likely that}} the survivor will experience post-traumatic stress symptoms. If a person dies, and the survivor was close to the person who died, then it is more likely that symptoms of grief will also develop. When the death is of <b>a</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one,</b> and was sudden or violent, then both symptoms often coincide. This is likely in children exposed to community violence.|$|E

Without sounding too political, one can draw a parallel with the current clime of terrorism, where normally peaceful religious groups are being incensed to hatred.|$|E
