25|$|Andreas Köstenberger {{states that}} there is strong {{evidence}} that parts of the Testimonium are authentic, and that the comparison of the Greek versions with the <b>Arabic</b> <b>version</b> (discovered by Shlomo Pines in the 1970s) provides {{an indication of the}} original Josephan text. Köstenberger states that many modern scholars believe that the <b>Arabic</b> <b>version</b> reflects the state of Josephus' original text before it was subject to Christian interpolation. Köstenberger adds that the passage includes vocabulary that is typically Josephan and the style is consistent with that of Josephus. Köstenberger (and separately Van Voorst) state that the Josephus' reference to the large number of followers of Jesus during his public ministry is unlikely to have been due to a Christian scribe familiar with the New Testament accounts, and is hence unlikely to be an interpolation.|$|E
