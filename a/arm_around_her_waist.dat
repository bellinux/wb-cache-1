2500|$|In {{the ninth}} season finale, [...] "Till Death Do Us Part", a bomb is planted by {{domestic}} terrorist Harper Dearing. Tony and Ziva, feeling bad about missing Jimmy and Breena's wedding, try to cheer {{each other up}} by joking about how awful weddings are—an exchange that begins to take on meaning when they become wistful about [...] "the vow, the ring, the kiss, the ketubah..." [...] and eloping instead of dealing with all the fuss. Later, when the Navy Yard is seconds from exploding, Ziva refuses to leave the building without Tony. The bomb goes off while they {{are still in the}} elevator; Ziva and Tony fall to the ground, with Tony's <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> and their free hands clasped tightly as the elevator appears to crash.|$|E
60|$|Flip {{dropped her}} eyes. Lance had got his other <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> but her {{resisting}} little hand was still potent.|$|E
60|$|He {{passed his}} <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> unconsciously; she {{permitted}} it as unconsciously, as he half supported her figure while they hurried forward.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Marcia!" [...] he said, [...] "what {{a strange}} girl you are!" [...] He sunk {{into his chair}} again, and, putting his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> drew <b>her</b> upon his knee, like a child.|$|R
60|$|She {{extended}} {{both her}} hands and burst into another and a still more violent flood of tears. The bee-hunter put one of his sturdy <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> and in another moment he was urging her over the plain, in rapid pursuit of their flying friends.|$|R
5000|$|Parvati, who was white-skinned (Gauri), naive, {{innocent}} and the tamer of Shiva morphs into Mahakali, who is bluish black-skinned (Kali), fierce, brave and is untamed by Shiva. She is {{armed with a}} scimitar, has {{her hair in a}} disarray and a garland of demon heads <b>around</b> <b>her</b> neck and an apron of demon <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall I {{tell you}} why?" [...] he said, fondly, passing his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> and drawing her pretty head nearer his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|She looked up. He {{ventured to}} put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b> She shook herself free, very weakly. He tried again and with success.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked very}} sweet {{as she came}} towards him, her eyes raised to him, her face full of the one happiness. He passed his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{passed his}} <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> tiny <b>waist.</b> She {{looked at him}} with frightened eyes.|$|R
60|$|He, however, {{repeated}} the question, touched with her charming preoccupation, and passing his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> little <b>waist.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I would, Selina"; and {{the young}} man passed his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> {{yielding}} <b>waist.</b> The two lovers gazed at each other's faces in unspeakable bliss. Suddenly Selina started.|$|R
60|$|He disregarded her bidding to {{the extent}} of placing his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b> He made no attempt, however, to draw her hands away from her face, or stop her tears.|$|E
6000|$|... "It sure is, Nellie," [...] {{returned}} Tom, as {{he slipped}} his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b> [...] "But I am mighty {{glad that you}} are safe. Do you think everybody is out?" ...|$|E
60|$|She flushed as the borderman put {{his right}} <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b> Then a clasp as of steel {{enclosed}} her; {{she felt herself}} swinging easily into the air, and over the muddy brook.|$|E
60|$|His <b>arms</b> were <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b> <b>Her</b> {{face was}} turned away, {{but he saw}} the glitter of a tear in her eyes, {{and he was very}} bold. He kissed it away.|$|R
60|$|He {{suddenly}} {{drew her}} to him, his <b>arm</b> went <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b> She {{had lost all}} power of resistance. For {{the first time in}} his life of his own deliberate accord, he kissed her--feverishly, almost roughly.|$|R
60|$|Jerome's hat went {{one way and}} {{his cane}} another. Jerome himself sprang across the {{intervening}} space and dropped into the chair beside Anne. He caught {{her hand in his}} and threw his <b>arm</b> boldly <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> {{and helped}} her out, and did not put her down till they reached the road. She was {{completely}} dressed, even to her hat and shoes, but she mourned: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am always}} {{glad to see}} you, Violet," [...] he said, putting his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> and kissing her. [...] "All the same, I {{am not sure that}} your coming here is {{altogether}} wise." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{laid his}} fingers upon her hand, and she {{followed}} him into the room. She was very pale, and she was breathing as though she had been running. He passed his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b>|$|E
60|$|She stopped breathless; {{she stopped}} with {{the corner of}} her apron against her tearful hazel eyes; she stopped with--what was more {{remarkable}} than all--Rand's <b>arm</b> actually <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> and his astonished, alarmed face within a few inches of her own.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, all of Ji-hoon’s {{fighting}} {{catches up}} with him. Ho-kyung and her clique, Jong-soo and his high school gang, and actual gang members confront him while holding Su-wan hostage. Ji-hoon and Su-wan manage to run away, but they eventually get cornered and Ji-hoon has to fight everyone on the beach. Once {{all of the other}} gang members are down, Ji-hoon faces the mafia's best fighter. Ji-hoon is at the man’s mercy, but Su-wan saves Ji-hoon by kicking the man in the groin. Then Su-wan and Ji-hoon drive away on her chicken delivery scooter, with Su-wan in the driver's seat and Ji-hoon behind <b>her,</b> his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b> At the end, Ji-hoon and Su-wan are now a couple, and she is tutoring his younger brother Se-hoon.|$|R
2500|$|Linda and Noor {{were sitting}} on a {{two-seater}} couch with Charlotte sitting on the arm, when Noor started touching Linda in a sexual way. He spoke into her ear, put his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> and refused to let her go. Kathleen then started screaming at him and a verbal altercation took place where Kathleen Mulhall was alleged to have instructed them to ”just kill him for me" [...] Charlotte picked up a Stanley knife and struck Noor across the throat, inflicting a wound that {{sent him to the}} ground. Linda then picked up a hammer and hit him on the head a number of times. Their mother looked on but didn't participate. Noor was stabbed at least 27 times. It may have been more, but pathologists had no opportunity to examine the full body.|$|R
60|$|FRANK. Because she's an old wretch, Viv. If {{you ever}} put your <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> in my {{presence}} again, I'll shoot myself there {{and then as a}} protest against an exhibition which revolts me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lean on me, baby," [...] he returned, passing his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> and {{dropping}} her head smartly on his shoulder. [...] "Thar!" [...] The act was brotherly and slightly contemptuous, {{but it was}} sufficient to at once establish their kinship.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was so much}} {{irritation}} in {{her voice}} that he drew nearer her and gently put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b> [...] "Why, whatever mine was, darling," [...] {{he said with a}} tender smile. [...] "You didn't fall in love with any particular name, did you, Loo?" ...|$|E
50|$|They all {{ride for}} the City of Elua, {{dedicated}} to true {{love and the}} hunt for Berlik. Upon arriving at the Palace, Imriel immediately goes to Sidonie's quarters, sinks to his knees before her and wraps his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b> Ysandre walks in {{on the scene and}} is furious. Imriel walks out from the Palace, but not before Sidonie kisses him before the all those watching. Mavros offers the Shahrizai hunting estates outside of the City for Imriel and the Albans {{to stay out of the}} turmoil of the City. Sidonie comes to see him. After lovemaking, a royal escort led by Lord Amaury Trente come to take her back home.

60|$|She sat silent, rigid with disappointment. Never had {{she been}} as miserable as at this moment. She felt like crying, and a sob really did become audible {{in spite of her}} effort to {{suppress}} it. Again O'Gorman passed his <b>arm</b> affectionately <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> and held <b>her</b> close while she tried to think what it all meant.|$|R
60|$|He {{talked to}} her reassuringly, holding her hands--most of the time, in fact, for the country was a sparsely {{populated}} one, with his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b> And then suddenly she seemed to lose her new-found content. Her cheeks were suddenly white. She looked everywhere restlessly about.|$|E
60|$|Now and again, {{on the way}} home, Dede {{could hear}} her big boy-husband chuckling gleefully. As they halted their horses {{on the top of}} the divide out of Bennett Valley, in order to watch the sunset, he ranged {{alongside}} and slipped his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Then {{came the}} agony of {{apprehension}} and doubt. Should I imprison in my hand that little hand with the dangling, scented gloves which had just tapped my lips? Should I dare to kiss her there and then, or slip my <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist?</b> Or dared I even sit closer? ...|$|E
40|$|Photograph of a Bakuria woman {{standing}} in front of a hut. The woman is shown from the waist up. She is wearing a cloth <b>around</b> <b>her</b> body and has her left hand on her right shoulder. <b>Her</b> right <b>arm</b> is <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b> The woman is wearing a set of earrings that connect in front of her chest with several chains...|$|R
60|$|She {{walked with}} a Southern girl's undulating languor to the door, opened it, then charged {{suddenly}} upon Octavia Dean, twirled her round in a wild waltz and bore her away; appearing a moment after on the playground demurely walking with <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> companion's <b>waist</b> in an ostentatious confidence at once lofty, exclusive, and exasperating to the smaller children.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, I {{know just}} what it is, darling,' cried the girl, putting <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> mother's <b>waist</b> caressingly, and drawing her down to kiss her face {{half a dozen times}} over in her {{outburst}} of sympathy. 'That horrid old Miss Catherine has been here again, I'm sure, for I saw her going out of the shop just now, and she's been saying something or other spiteful, as she always does, to vex my dearie. What did she say to you to-day, now do tell us, duckie mother?' ...|$|R
