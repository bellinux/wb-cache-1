40|$|To {{achieve a}} robust system the {{variation}} seen for different speaking styles must be handled. An investigation of standard {{automatic speech recognition}} techniques for different speaking styles showed that lexical modelling using general-purpose variants gave small improvements, but the errors differed compared with using only one canonical pronunciation per word. Modelling the variation using the acoustic models (using context dependency and/or speaker dependent adaptation) gave a significant improvement, but the resulting performance for non-native and spontaneous speech was still far from read speech. In this dissertation a complete data-driven approach to rule-based lexicon adaptation is presented, where {{the effect of the}} acoustic models is incorporated in the rule pruning metric. Reference and alternative transcriptions were aligned by dynamic programming, but with a data-driven method to derive the phone-to-phone substitution costs. The costs were based on the statistical co-occurrence of phones, association strength. Rules for pronunciation variation were derived from this alignment. The rules were pruned using a new metric based on <b>acoustic</b> <b>log</b> likelihood. Well trained acoustic models are capable of modelling much of the variation seen, and using the <b>acoustic</b> <b>log</b> likelihood to assess the pronunciation rules prevents the lexical modelling from adding variation already accounted for as shown for direct pronunciation variation modelling. For the non-native task data-driven pronunciation modelling by learning pronunciation rules gave a significant performance gain. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>log</b> likelihood rule pruning performed better than rule probability pruning. For spontaneous dictation the pronunciation variation experiments did not improve the performance. The answer to how to better model the variation for spontaneous speech seems to lie neither in the acoustical nor the lexical modelling. The main differences between read and spontaneous speech are the grammar used and disfluencies like restarts and long pauses. The language model may thus be the best starting point for more research to achieve better performance for this speaking style. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{application of}} borehole <b>acoustic</b> <b>logging</b> is {{the determination of}} formation permeability using Stoneley waves. Heterogeneous permeable structures, such as fractures, sand-shale sequences, etc., are commonly encountered in <b>acoustic</b> <b>logging.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the effects of the permeability heterogeneities on the borehole Stoneley wave propagation. We have studied the effects of formation permeability heterogeneities on the Stoneley wave propagation when the heterogeneity changes in radial and azimuthal directions (Zhao et al, 1993). To further study the problem of <b>acoustic</b> <b>logging</b> in heterogeneous porous formations, we study the case where the formation permeability varies in the borehole axial and radial directions. This is a very important problem because vertical heterogeneity variations are commonly encountered in <b>acoustic</b> <b>logging</b> applications. Using the finite difference approach, such heterogeneities as random heterogeneous permeability variations, multiple fracture zones, permeable (sand) - non-permeable (shale) sequences, can be readily modeled, and the results are presented. Our numerical simulation results show that the continuous permeability variations in the formation have only minimal effects on the Stoneley wave propagation. Whereas the discontinuous variation (e. g., permeable sand and non-permeable shale sequences) can have significant effeces on the Stoneley wave propagation. However, when the Stoneley wavelength is considerably large compared to the scale of heterogeneity variations, the Stoneley wave is sensitive only to the overall fluid transmissivity of the formation heterogeneity, To demonstrate the effects of heterogeneity on the Stoneley wave propagation. an experimental data set (Winkler et aI., 1989) has been modeled using a randomly layered permeability model. The heterogeneous permeability model results agree with the data very well, while the data disagree with the results from homogeneous permeability models. The numerical technique for calculating Stoneley wave propagation across permeability heterogeneities has been applied to interpret the <b>acoustic</b> <b>logging</b> data across a heeerogeneous fraceure zone (paillet. 1984). The modeling technique, in conjunction with a variable permeability model, successfully explains the non-symmetric patterns of the Stoneley wave attenuation and reileceion at the top and bottom of the fracture zone, while it is difficult to explain these patterns using a homogeneous permeable zone model. The technique developed in this study can be used as an effective means for characterizing permeability heterogeneities using borehole Stoneley waves. Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
