40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{differences in}} articulation rate between fast <b>and</b> <b>slow</b> speakers in a production experiment.

5|$|Manganism is a biphasic disorder. In {{its early}} stages, an {{intoxicated}} person may experience depression, mood swings, compulsive behaviors, and psychosis.

Unlike Parkinson's disease, manganism is not associated with loss of smell and patients are typically unresponsive to treatment with L-DOPA. Symptoms of late-stage manganism become more severe over time even if the source of exposure is removed and brain manganese levels return to normal.|$|E

5|$|Within {{six hours}} of its {{classification}} as Tropical Low 13U, the system developed a central dense overcast, which is an organized area of convection around the center. At 18:00UTC on February16, the BoM upgraded the low to a Category1 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, naming it Lam. At that time, the BoM anticipated the cyclone would intensify to peak 10 minute sustained winds of 185km/h (115mph) within 72 hours, which proved very accurate. Also at 18:00UTC on February16, the JTWC began classifying the system as Tropical Cyclone 12P. Early on February17, an eye feature began forming within the convection. That day, Lam moved quicker to the west-northwest <b>and</b> <b>slowed</b> its rate of strengthening as it approached the Wessel Islands. Early on February18, the eye became better defined, moving over Cape Wessel. At 06:00UTC that day, the BoM upgraded Lam to a Category3 Severe Tropical Cyclone with 10 minute winds of 120km/h (75mph), equivalent to a minimal hurricane.|$|E
5|$|After {{maintaining}} a nearly steady course for three days, Hurricane Debbie turned northward <b>and</b> <b>slowed</b> as it neared {{a break in}} the ridge previously steering it west-northwestward. During the evening of September 11, a United States Navy Aircraft reconnaissance mission into the storm found sustained winds of 110 – 120 mph (175 – 195 km/h) and a central pressure of 976 mbar (hPa; 28.82 inHg), reaching its peak intensity as a modern-day Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). After maintaining its windspeeds for over 24 hours, the system weakened and turned sharply towards the east-northeast in response to the upper-level westerlies. By the afternoon of September 13, Debbie was again a Category 1 storm as it quickly accelerated towards the Azores. Early on September 15, the storm passed over the easternmost Azores with winds estimated at 80 mph (130 km/h) before turning more northeasterly. Once past the Azores, there is an uncertainty over the structural changes that took place with Debbie. According to the United States Weather Bureau's preliminary report, the system acquired characteristics of an extratropical cyclone on September 15, though remained a strong system. This conflicts with the best track supplied by the Bureau and the National Hurricane Center's hurricane database maintains the system as a tropical cyclone until the afternoon of September 16.|$|E
5|$|Allied columns started pouring {{against the}} French right, {{but not at}} the desired speed, so the French were mostly {{successful}} in curbing the attacks. Actually, the Allied deployments were mistaken and poorly timed: cavalry detachments under Liechtenstein on the Allied left flank had to be placed in the right flank and in the process they ran into <b>and</b> <b>slowed</b> down part of the second column of infantry that was advancing towards the French right. At the time, the planners thought this slowing was disastrous, but later on it helped the Allies. Meanwhile, the leading elements of the second column were attacking the village of Sokolnitz, which was defended by the 26th Light Regiment and the Tirailleurs, French skirmishers. Initial Allied assaults proved unsuccessful and General Langeron ordered the bombardment of the village. This deadly barrage forced the French out, and at about the same time, the third column attacked the castle of Sokolnitz. The French, however, counterattacked and regained the village, only to be thrown out again. Conflict in this area ended temporarily when Friant's division (part of III Corps) retook the village. Sokolnitz was perhaps the most fought over area in the battlefield and would change hands several times as the day progressed.|$|E
