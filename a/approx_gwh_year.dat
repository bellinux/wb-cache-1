40|$|A {{reliable}} {{data base}} for determining efficiency {{would be created}} by setting up benchmarking of compressed air systems in Switzerland. By working together with the efficiency campaign running in Germany, all the sectors could be covered with statistically more meaningful total numbers. Since benchmarking also gives or could give indications for improvements depending on the respective figures involved, an automated initial consultation is simultaneously linked with the simple comparison of figures. The authors of this study therefore recommend launching a coampaign in Switzerland similar to the German model. With electricity xonsumption in compressed air systems totalling <b>approx.</b> 760 <b>GWh</b> per <b>year</b> in Switzerland and an average electricity price of 12 rappen/kWh, {{it is estimated that}} appropriate activities could make savings of <b>approx.</b> 50 <b>GWh</b> electricity and of 6 million Swiss francs in energy costs in companies. The costs of such a three-year campaign would amount to approx. 575 000 Swiss Francs. This summ includes both the costs for the scientific monitoring and the neutral project coordination (307 000 Francs) and the costs for the collaborating (compressed air) companies (280 000 Francs) as well...|$|R
50|$|Theoretically, {{hydroelectricity}} {{potential in}} Argentina {{has been estimated}} at 169,000 <b>GWh</b> per <b>year</b> while the feasible potential is closer to 130,000 <b>GWh</b> per <b>year.</b> Total installed hydro capacity is around 10,000 MW across 35 locations throughout the country. The average annual power generation in Argentina is 32,000 <b>GWh</b> per <b>year</b> representing about 25% of the feasible potential.
