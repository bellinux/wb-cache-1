Ickworth Church, which the 7th Marquess had bought in 1986 after commissioners {{declared}} it redundant, was inherited by the 8th Marquess and restored with a Heritage Lottery grant. The East Wing of Ickworth House was converted by the National Trust into a luxury hotel in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The {{man holding}} up a sword is Hieronymus Jaroslaw Łaski, a diplomat and nephew of Archbishop Jan Łaski. Both men are shown {{to the right of}} the king, at the top of the crowd.

5|$|With a much-diminished {{group of}} followers, Catesby made a stand at Holbeche House in Staffordshire, against a 200-strong company of armed men. He {{was shot and}} later found dead, {{clutching}} {{a picture of the}} Virgin Mary. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> to others, his body was exhumed and subsequently decapitated, his head exhibited outside Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Completed in {{the context}} of the Yugoslav wars, the film {{constitutes}} an investigation into the consequences of xenophobia and state-sanctioned repression, as well as an indictment of a failure in reaching out. It is thus often described as a verdict on the history of Romania, as well as on problems facing the Balkans at large, and occasionally described <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> that violence could also erupt in a purely Romanian context.|$|E
5|$|Edward Duffy, an {{associate}} professor at Marquette University, says that one of the central characters of Chamber of Secrets is a book, Tom Riddle's enchanted diary, which takes control of Ginny Weasley – just as Riddle planned. Duffy suggests that Rowling intended this <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> against passively consuming information from sources that have their own agendas. Although Bronwyn Williams and Amy Zenger regard the diary as more like an instant messaging or chat room system, they agree about the dangers of relying too much on the written word, which can camouflage the author, and they highlight a comical example, Lockhart's self-promoting books.|$|E
5|$|Erinys– The {{daughter}} of Thanatos. After {{the destruction of}} Atlantis, Erinys searched for Kratos, killing various Spartans <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> for Kratos to stop his quest to find Deimos. Erinys eventually found Kratos in the Mounts of Aroania, and after a land battle, an aerial battle ensued as Erinys shape shifted into an enormous bird before being killed by Kratos, after which, Kratos took her power, the Scourge of Erinys. The character was overdub voiced by Jennifer Hale and Erin Torpey in Ghost of Sparta.|$|E

5|$|Hungarian troops {{suffered}} 126 {{dead and}} 241 wounded during the sporadic fighting, and killed between 1,122 and 3,500 civilians, including some Volksdeutsche. Many civilians {{were arrested and}} tortured. On 14 April 1941, around 500 Jews and Serbs were bayoneted to death, probably <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> to others not to resist. During post-war questioning, Horthy insisted {{that he had not}} wished to invade Yugoslavia, but that he had been compelled to act by disorder and the massacre of Hungarians in Bačka, but these claims have been dismissed by Tomasevich.|$|E
5|$|Liu Kang {{returns in}} Mortal Kombat X. In the game's Story Mode, he is resurrected by Quan Chi and now serves {{him as one}} of the revenants until Sub-Zero, Scorpion and Jax are revived. He fights both Jax and Raiden in Story Mode, which he blames Raiden for his death. At {{the end of the story}} mode, he and Kitana become the new rulers of the Netherrealm due to Quan Chi's death and Shinnok's defeat. A now darker Raiden brings them Shinnok's disembodied head <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> for them not to attack Earthrealm.|$|E

5|$|Long, highly {{sensitive}} whiskers and front paws help the sea otter find prey by touch when waters are dark or murky. Researchers have noted when they approach in plain view, sea otters react more rapidly {{when the wind}} is blowing towards the animals, indicating the sense of smell is more important than sight <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> sense. Other observations indicate the sea otter's sense of sight is useful above and below the water, although not as good as that of seals. Its hearing is neither particularly acute nor poor.|$|E
5|$|Lucius and {{his army}} were spared, {{due to his}} kinship with Antony, the strongman of the East, while Fulvia was exiled to Sicyon. Octavian showed no mercy, however, for the mass of allies loyal to Lucius; on 15 March, the anniversary of Julius Caesar's assassination, he had 300 Roman {{senators}} and equestrians executed for allying with Lucius. Perusia also was pillaged and burned <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> for others. This bloody event sullied Octavian's reputation and was criticized by many, such as Augustan poet Sextus Propertius.|$|E
5|$|No tells Bond that he {{is working}} with the Russians and has built an {{elaborate}} underground facility from which he can sabotage US test missiles launched from Cape Canaveral. He had previously been a member of a Chinese tong, but after he stole a large amount of money from their treasury, he was captured by the organisation. The tong's leaders had No's hands cut off <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> to others, and then shot. Because No's heart was {{on the right side of}} his body, the bullet missed it and he survived.|$|E

5|$|Oppressive efforts, {{often led}} by Poles, {{including}} Crown tenants or their Jewish plenipotents, Ruthenian nobles of the Commonwealth and even upper-rank Cossack officers, to subjugate and exploit economically the Cossack territories and population in Zaporizhia region, {{resulted in a}} series of Cossack uprisings, of which the early ones could have served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> for szlachta legislators. While Ukraine was undergoing substantial economic development, Cossacks and peasants were by and large not among the beneficiaries of the process.|$|E
5|$|Several {{commentators}} {{have noted that}} personal identity is a strong theme in the book, and that it addresses issues of racism through the treatment of non-magical, non-human and non-living characters. Some commentators regard the diary <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> against uncritical acceptance of information from sources whose motives and reliability cannot be checked. Institutional authority is portrayed as self-serving and incompetent. The book is also known to have some connections to the sixth novel of the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.|$|E
5|$|The {{black stork}} has {{a wider range}} of calls than the white stork, its main call being a chee leee, which sounds like a loud inhalation. It makes a hissing call <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> or threat. Displaying males produce a long series of wheezy raptor-like {{squealing}} calls rising in volume and then falling. It rarely indulges in mutual bill-clattering when adults meet at the nest. Adults will do so as part of their mating ritual or when angered. The young clatter their bills when aroused.|$|E

5|$|Although written {{during the}} Twelfth dynasty, Ipuwer only survives from a Nineteenth dynasty papyrus. However, A {{man and his}} Ba is found on an {{original}} Twelfth dynasty papyrus, Papyrus Berlin 3024. These two texts resemble other discourses in style, tone, and subject matter, although they are unique in that the fictional audiences are given very active roles in the exchange of dialogue. In Ipuwer, a sage addresses an unnamed king and his attendants, describing the miserable state of the land, which he blames on the king's inability to uphold royal virtues. This can be seen either <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> to kings or as a legitimization of the current dynasty, contrasting it with the supposedly turbulent period that preceded it. In A man and his Ba, a man recounts for an audience a conversation with his ba (a component of the Egyptian soul) on whether to continue living in despair or to seek death as an escape from misery.|$|E
5|$|Barlow {{immediately}} {{turned to}} investigate the strange sail, steering southwards directly at the lumbering vessel. Saulnier was seemingly unwilling to attempt any manoeuvere {{in the face of}} the enemy, as Africaine continued to hold the original course without deviation. By 19:30 it was inevitable that Phoebe would intercept Africaine and Saulnier shortened sail, slowing his frigate to meet the threat. Barlow was still unsure of the identity of the stranger and fired a shot over Africaine <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> to its captain to identify his ship. Saulnier responded by turning to port and firing a broadside directly at Phoebe. It was poorly aimed however and mostly scattered into the sea without effect. At this, Barlow pulled Phoebe into a parallel position to Africaine and unleashed a much more devastating broadside from close range. The two frigates then began an exchange of fire at close range.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth was {{regarded}} by her contemporaries as an efficient but ruthless politician who used political intrigues {{to protect and}} defend her daughters' rights. She was a caring parent, but was neither politically talented nor competent to prepare Mary and Hedwig for their roles as monarchs. Elizabeth failed to {{set a good example}} for her daughters, and her unbalanced character and questionable methods in politics would serve more <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning</b> to the young sovereigns. Her procrastinations and inability to make clear decisions threatened Hedwig's status, while her endless problems with Croatian nobles and failure to improve relations with her native Bosnia made Mary's reign insecure and tumultuous.|$|E
