5|$|The {{hurricane}} produced light {{rainfall and}} high tides <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>Coast</b> of the United States. Some low-level flooding was reported, but damage was slight. In Mexico, the hurricane caused strong winds and moderate rainfall. The winds caused extensive damage to villages in northeastern Mexico, with about 25,000 people left homeless. The rainfall, reaching over 17.52inches (445mm), caused flooding and mudslides which killed eleven people in Tamaulipas. Overall damage is unknown.|$|E

All of them ranked as only F0 on the Fujita scale. The worst twister occurred in Indian River County, damaging 133buildings, {{most of which}} were mobile homes.

5|$|As {{with other}} requiem sharks, the blacktip shark {{exhibits}} vivipary. Females typically {{give birth to}} four to seven (range one to 10) pups every other year, making use of shallow coastal nurseries that offer plentiful food and fewer predators. Known nurseries include Pine Island Sound, Terra Ceia Bay, and Yankeetown <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>Coast</b> of Florida, Bulls Bay {{on the coast of}} South Carolina, and Pontal do Paraná on the coast of Brazil. Although adult blacktip sharks are highly mobile and disperse over long distances, they are philopatric and return to their original nursery areas to give birth. This results in a series of genetically distinct breeding stocks that overlap in geographic range.|$|E

Moreover, the Piojillo river overflowed its banks, killing many people and resulting in considerable damage. Elsewhere, destruction was reported in San Jose del Cabo, Cabo San Lucas, San Lucas, and Puntas Arena; Pichilinague also received moderate damage.

The system gradually intensified and was declared Tropical Storm Bonnie the next day as it moved generally towards the west-northwest. On June25, Bonnie was upgraded to a hurricane. Bonnie strengthened further and on the following day, the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h). Shortly thereafter, Bonnie made Landfall near High Island, Texas. Following landfall, Bonnie quickly weakened below tropical storm status and dissipated over Missouri on June28.|$|E

5|$|The 1987 Gulf Coast {{tropical}} storm caused flooding <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>Coast</b> of the United States. The second tropical cyclone and first {{tropical storm}} of the 1987 Atlantic hurricane season, it originated from a tropical wave in the Gulf of Mexico, southeast of Texas, on August9. Initially a tropical depression, the cyclone moved north-northwestward and slightly intensified into {{a tropical storm}} later that day. By August10, it made landfall between Galveston and Beaumont. The system weakened after moving inland and turned towards the east and later southeast. Briefly reemerging over the Gulf on August15, the depression moved onshore a second time in Florida, before dissipating over eastern Georgia on August17.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} caused {{severe damage}} <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>Coast.</b> Many marine vessels were blown ashore or sunken in Pensacola, and railroads {{in the city}} were severely damaged. Numerous wharfs were damaged or destroyed, and many roofs were torn off buildings. Three forts {{in the vicinity of}} Pensacola suffered damage. Electricity in the city was shut off. A total of 35 people were killed in Pensacola. Mobile and surrounding areas suffered similar damage, including destroyed timber, smashed windows, and sunken watercraft. In Mississippi, over 300,000 cotton bales were ruined during the hurricane, amounting to $12,000,000 in damage. Damage in New Orleans was minimal; however, Lake Pontchartrain overflowed, flooding the city. The hurricane killed a total of 134 people.|$|E
5|$|This {{hypothesis}} {{was viewed as}} radical when first proposed, but additional evidence soon emerged. The boundary clay {{was found to be}} full of minute spherules of rock, crystallized from droplets of molten rock formed by the impact. Shocked quartz and other minerals were also identified in the K–Pg boundary. Shocked minerals have their internal structure deformed, and are created by intense pressures such as those associated with nuclear blasts or meteorite impacts. The identification of giant tsunami beds <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>Coast</b> and the Caribbean also provided evidence for impact, and suggested that the impact may have occurred nearby—as did the discovery that the K–Pg boundary became thicker in the southern United States, with meter-thick beds of debris occurring in northern New Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Bertha was {{a minimal}} {{tropical}} storm that made landfall twice <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>Coast</b> of the United States in August 2002. The second tropical storm of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season, Bertha {{developed in the}} northern Gulf of Mexico out of a trough of low pressure that extended into the Atlantic on August 4. It quickly organized and reached tropical storm strength before making landfall on southeastern Louisiana. Bertha turned to the southwest over the state, and re-entered the Gulf of Mexico on August 7. It remained disorganized due to proximity to land, and after making landfall on south Texas, Bertha dissipated on August 9.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Chris caused minor {{flooding}} <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>Coast</b> of the United States in September 1982. The fifth {{tropical cyclone}} and third named storm of the 1982 Atlantic hurricane season, Chris developed from a surface low-pressure {{area in the}} northern Gulf of Mexico on September9. Although initially displaying subtropical characteristics, the low pressure area gradually acquired tropical characteristics, and was reclassified as Tropical Depression Four within 24hours of development. The depression then began to intensify and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Chris on September10. Thereafter, the storm turned north-northeastward and strengthened further. On September11, Chris peaked as a 65mph (100km/h) tropical storm. Later that day, it made landfall near Sabine Pass, Port Arthur, Texas. By September13, Chris dissipated over Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|While Gert {{was still}} located over the peninsula, the {{government}} of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch for the Gulf Coast {{from the city of}} Veracruz northward to Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas. By September18, it had been upgraded to a tropical storm warning and extended southward to Minatitlán, although the initial watch area was placed under a hurricane watch after Gert showed signs of strengthening. The next day, the tropical storm watch from Soto La Marina to Nautla was upgraded to a hurricane warning as it became clearer where Gert would make landfall. Prior to impact, several ports <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>Coast</b> halted their operations, and people living in risk zones were evacuated. All warnings and watches were discontinued after the hurricane moved inland.|$|E
