2500|$|Novelist Joanna Trollope commented in The Times that, [...] "This is not {{a matter}} of that age-old - and {{impossible}} - difficulty of the plagiarism of ideas. It is something much easier to define, and a danger to all writers. It is - let's not mince our words - the theft of someone's writing, someone's own words stolen in exactly the form in which their brain produced them. And it's a theft to which all writers are vulnerable. Jo Rowling didn't have to do this. I should think that her time in New York was horrible, exacerbated by a lack of support caused, no doubt, by deeply unattractive sourness over her wealth. Well, I applaud her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> I'm not alone. I am thrilled for her, and very grateful to her, for taking the stand she did - and winning." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rolling Stone {{staff writer}} J. D. Considine gave Louder Than Love {{three and a}} half out of five stars, saying that [...] "Chris Cornell has the sort of soaring, muscular voice Ian Astbury can only dream of, while guitarist Kim Thayil comes across like The Edge with an attitude". He stated that [...] "the songs on Louder Than Love are mean, lean and {{fighting}} fit". However, Considine criticized Cornell's lyrics, observing that [...] "much of what the band has to say is clichéd, confused or generally incomprehensible". He ended his review by saying that [...] "even when his lyrics are as dumb as rocks... Cornell delivers them with such full-throated intensity that they actually sound impressive." [...] Allmusic staff writer Steve Huey gave the album three out of five stars, saying that [...] "too much of the album drifts along without focus or variety." [...] Critic Robert Christgau gave the album a C+, stating that it is [...] "covertly conceptual, arty in spite of itself, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> metal fans don't bite".|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{mean that}} I will this very evening propose to Madeline Croston under your nose, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> you five pounds she accepts me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what I told him. At least, I said he couldn't row for toffee, so he {{said all}} right, <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> can lick you, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> said <b>I</b> <b>betted</b> he couldn't, <b>and</b> he said all right, then, let's try, {{and then the other}} chaps wanted to join in, so we made an inter-house thing of it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> want you to come and stroke us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All these here critics {{telling what}} low-brows us American {{business}} men are! Just between you <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> knock down more good, big, round, iron men every week than nine-tenths of these high-brow fiddlers--yes, and college professors and authors, too!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now! You'd love Gopher Prairie. We've {{been doing}} a lot with lawns and {{gardening}} the past few years, and it's so homey--the big trees and----And the best people on earth. <b>And</b> keen. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> Luke Dawson----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Son, {{let me tell}} you, I'll own a horseless {{carriage}} some day, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> I go {{an average}} of twenty miles an hour with it, maybe forty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But shucks! Your mother won't know, and so what's the harm? All {{she wants}} is that you'll be safe; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> you she'd 'a' said go there if she'd 'a' thought of it. I know she would!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gopher Prairie {{is going}} to have a great future. Some of the best dairy and wheat land in the state right near there--some of it selling right now at one-fifty an acre, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> it will go up to two and a quarter in ten years!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By George!" [...] cried Burke, [...] "Captain Horn was right! They {{could hardly}} {{get a chance}} to safely {{interfere}} with her until she had sailed from Kingston, <b>and</b> now <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> they are waiting for her outside the Caribbees!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The scoundrel is a coward," [...] Terence said to himself. [...] "He may profess {{absolute}} confidence, but I don't {{think he}} feels it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will <b>bet</b> odds that he won't {{be in the}} front when the time for fighting comes." ...|$|R
60|$|HARRY. [With a shrug of the shoulders.] You {{wait till}} Freddy's {{number one in}} Hankow <b>and</b> can entertain. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> the white ladies will be glad enough to know his missus then.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because if it's only a game--we boys {{against the}} masters," [...] {{continued}} Dan, [...] "then let's play according to rule. If we're here to learn--well, you've {{been in the}} class four months and I've just come, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> I know more Ovid than you do already." [...] Which was true.|$|E
6000|$|The {{little old}} lady screwed up the {{delicate}} skin about her eyes, examined Milt, and cackled, [...] "Boy, there's something wrong here. You don't belong with my family. Why, you look like an American. You haven't got an imitation monocle, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> you can't talk with a New York-London accent. Why, Claire, I'm ashamed of you for bringing a human being into the Boltwood-Gilson-Saxton tomb and expecting----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Me and Huck's found Jubiter Dunlap's corpse all by {{ourselves}} with a bloodhound, after everybody else had quit hunting and given it up; {{and if it}} hadn't a been for us it never WOULD 'a' been found; and he WAS murdered too--they done it with a club or something like that; and I'm going to start in and find the murderer, next, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> I'll do it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Seymour? pooh! he's a muff <b>and</b> a prig. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> you he won't {{find her}} out; she's the jolliest little humbugger there is going. She'd cheat a fellow {{out of the}} sight of his eyes. It's {{perfectly}} wonderful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{a manner}} of speakin', do doubt, he is always in trainin'," [...] remarked the horsebreaker. [...] "But trainin' for {{everyday}} work ain't the same as trainin' with a trainer; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> dare <b>bet,</b> with all respec' to your opinion, Mr. Wilson, that there's half a stone of tallow on him at this minute." ...|$|R
6000|$|I said [...] "You shall hove the {{privilege}} of placing the balls to suit yourself, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> want to <b>bet</b> you a dollar that you can't run fifteen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's a farm-house or something," [...] he declared, cheerily. [...] "We'll just nach'ly make 'em give us shelter. Going {{to storm}} too bad {{to do much}} work for 'em, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> it's some cranky old {{shellback}} farmer, living 'way out here like this. Well, we'll teach the old codger to like music, and this time I will play my mouth-organ. Ain't you glad we're young folks that like music and dancing--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Matlack {{looked about}} him, {{and then he}} laughed. [...] "All right," [...] said he; [...] "there ain't no need of worryin' ourselves. They haven't left a thing of theirs about, everything's packed {{up and ready to}} be sent for. When people do that, you may be sure nothing's {{happened}} to them. They've gone off, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> it's {{to get rid of that}} young woman's preachin'. But I don't blame them; I don't wonder they couldn't stand it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I bet you are, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> {{you do a}} jolly rank paper too,' I said, {{remembering that}} the sceptic is {{sometimes}} vouchsafed revelations to which the most devout believer may not aspire. It is, for instance, always {{the young man who}} scoffs at ghosts that the family spectre chooses as his audience. But it required more than a mere sneer or an empty gibe to pump information out of Bradshaw. He took me up at once.|$|E
6000|$|Up came John Johnson (I {{will not}} say 'Jack,' [...] For that were vulgar, cold, and commonplace [...] On great occasions, such as an attack [...] On cities, as hath been the present case): [...] Up Johnson came, with {{hundreds}} at his back, [...] Exclaiming;--'Juan! Juan! On, boy! brace [...] Your arm, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> 'll <b>bet</b> Moscow to a dollar [...] That you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will win St. George's collar.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay!" [...] Ricardo ejaculated for {{the third}} time, more and more enlightened and perplexed. [...] "Can't bear to talk about it--so bad as that? <b>And</b> yet <b>I</b> would <b>bet</b> she isn't a miracle to look at." ...|$|R
6000|$|Cotton's {{scattered}} senses were evidently returning, for {{he looked}} up, saying: [...] "I'm only shaken, Miss Steel, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> won the <b>bet.</b> Don't be in a hurry, Ormesby; I hardly fancy I {{could get up}} just yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] {{said the}} seaman to himself, [...] "it doesn't matter a bit. We are bound for Liverpool, and I'll take the letter there myself, and then I'll send {{it over to}} Paris for tuppence ha'penny, which I will have then, and haven't now. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> another tuppence that it will go sooner than if I posted it here, for {{it may be a}} month before a mail-steamer leaves {{the other side of this}} beastly continent. Anyway, I'm doing the best I can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gallery, Miss Hannay; {{please call}} it a gallery, it sounds so much better. We got in five yards. I should hardly have {{believed}} it possible, but Bathurst is a tremendous fellow to work. He uses a pick {{as if he had}} been a sapper all his life. We kept the men pretty hard at work, I can tell you, carrying up the earth. Richards is at work now, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> him five rupees that he and Herbert don't drive as far as we did." ...|$|E
60|$|Whenever I {{looked at}} {{the bow of the}} Snark or thought of her water- tight compartments, I was encouraged. Nobody else, however, was encouraged. My friends began to make bets against the various sailing dates of the Snark. Mr. Wiget, who was left behind in charge of our Sonoma ranch was the first to cash his bet. He {{collected}} on New Year's Day, 1907. After that the bets came fast and furious. My friends surrounded me like a gang of harpies, making bets against every sailing date I set. I was rash, and I was stubborn. I bet, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>bet,</b> and I continued to bet; and I paid them all. Why, the women-kind of my friends grew so brave that those among them who never bet before began to bet with me. And I paid them, too.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, you dear little woman! You {{need not}} send for letter the back: {{and you need}} not tell me what was in it: <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will <b>bet</b> you a hundred yards of lace to a cotton nightcap--and you know whether I, madam, am a man a bonnet-de-coton--I will let you that I {{know what you have}} been writing about, under pretence of a message about lace, to our Colonel." ...|$|R
5000|$|Blackburn had a {{difficult}} relationship with fellow DJ John Peel, whom he recalled saying: [...] "'People don’t realise how much you’ve done for soul music,' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> said: 'I <b>bet</b> you’d never say that publicly,' and he said: 'Oh no!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr Harford, {{not quite}} {{accustomed}} to the popular use of the verb to terrify, began to ask what the child had done to alarm her mother so much and Nancy, understanding him as little, said, [...] "'Tis all along of Dame Verdon, ma'am. She be for {{to say that the}} new governess will beat them and send them off to Minsterham, as sure as they're alive; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> told <b>Bet</b> not to believe no such stuff, but her won't listen to I--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Twelve o'clock, {{the hour}} at {{which most of}} the offices closed on Saturday in summer, was excitedly approaching. The office-women {{throughout}} the Septimus Building, who had been showing off their holiday frocks all morning, were hastily finishing letters, or rushing to the women's wash-rooms to discuss with one another the hang of new skirts. All morning Bessie Kraker had kept up a monologue, beginning, [...] "Say, lis-ten, Miss Golden, say, gee! I was goin' down to South Beach with my gentleman friend this afternoon, and, say, what d'you think the piker had to go and get stuck for? He's got to work all afternoon. I don't care--I don't care! I'm going to Coney Island with Sadie, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> you we pick up some fellows and do the light fantastic till one G. M. Oh, you sad sea waves! I bet Sadie and me make 'em sad!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The London {{season was}} very nearly {{come to an}} end, and Lord Farintosh had danced I don't {{know how many times}} with Miss Newcome, had drunk several bottles of the old Kew port, had been seen at {{numerous}} breakfasts, operas, races, and public places by the young lady's side, and had not as yet made any such proposal as Lady Kew expected for her granddaughter. Clive going to see his military friends in the Regent's Park once, and finish Captain Butts's portrait in barracks, heard two or three young men talking, and one say to another, [...] "I bet you three to two Farintosh don't marry her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> you even that he don't ask her." [...] Then as he entered Mr. Butts's room, where these gentlemen were conversing, there was a silence and an awkwardness. The young fellows were making an [...] "event" [...] out of Ethel's marriage, and sporting their money freely on it.|$|E
6000|$|At another camp, a packer {{was telling}} of an immense nugget {{that had been}} {{discovered}} somewhere on the upper waters of Birch Creek. [...] "And say, fellers, you know there is another lake up there pretty near as big as Atlin. They are calling it Lake Surprise. I heard a feller say {{a few days ago}} there was a big lake up there and I thought he meant a lake six or eight miles long. On the very high ground next to Birch, you can look down over that lake <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> it's sixty miles long. It must reach nearly to Teslin Lake." [...] There was something pretty fine in the thought of being in a country where lakes sixty miles long were being discovered and set forth on the maps of the world. Up to this time Atlin Lake itself was unmapped. To an unpractical man like myself it was reward enough to feel the thrill of excitement which comes with such discoveries.|$|E
6000|$|... "I bet {{five hundred}} even {{that it would}} be over in a quarter of an hour; <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> Byron two hundred and fifty to one that it wouldn't. That's the way to doit; eh, Bedford? Catch Cashel letting two hundred and fifty slip through his fingers! By George, though, he's an artful card. At the end of {{fourteen}} minutes I thought my five hundred was corpsed. The Dutchman was full of fight; and Cashel suddenly turned weak and tried to back out of the rally. You should have seen the gleam in the Dutchman's eye when he rushed in after him. He made cock-sure of finishing him straight off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{regiment}} {{is in his}} brigade, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will <b>bet</b> {{any money}} that we have our share of fighting. What sort of man is Johnston? He is a fine fellow--a soldier, heart and soul. You could tell him anywhere, {{and we have a}} first-rate fellow in command of the cavalry--Colonel Stuart--a splendid, dashing fellow, full of life and go. His fellows swear by him. I quite envy you, for I expect you will astonish the Yankee horsemen. They are no great riders up there, you know, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> reckon the first time you meet them you will astonish them." ...|$|R
5000|$|Among {{his most}} popular {{writings}} were {{a series of}} animal verses, many of which featured his off-kilter rhyming devices. Examples include [...] "If called by a panther / Don't anther"; [...] "Who wants my jellyfish? / I'm not sellyfish!"; [...] "The one-L lama, he's a priest. The two-L llama, he's a beast. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> will <b>bet</b> a silk pajama: there isn't any three-L lllama!". Nash later appended the footnote [...] " [...] *The author's attention has been called to a type of conflagration known as a three-alarmer. Pooh." ...|$|R
