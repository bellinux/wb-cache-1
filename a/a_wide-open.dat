5|$|Keating reaped {{benefits}} from the move to Arizona, <b>a</b> <b>wide-open</b> territory in both a physical and business sense that allowed someone a fresh start. He turned the now-renamed American Continental Corporation around, adding various operations and divisions in a structure somewhat reminiscent of American Financial. As chairman and controlling stockholder, Keating relied heavily upon family members, employing his son and four of his sons-in-law in prominent positions. Charles Keating III had a fast career rise within the company.|$|E
5|$|The West took a 10–6 {{lead with}} 6:59 {{left in the}} game when Hall {{connected}} with UCLA fullback Ryan Moya for an 8-yard touchdown pass. A key play on the drive was a 41-yard pass from Hall to Eastern Washington tight end Nathan Overbay as he was cutting across the middle of <b>a</b> <b>wide-open</b> field. BYU's Dennis Pitta then caught a 17yard reception.|$|E
5|$|Despite Toronto's {{improved}} defensive performances, Carter's offence was sorely {{missed in}} the first-round {{series against the}} second-seeded Detroit Pistons. In the first game, Detroit overwhelmed Toronto 83–65, largely due to Ben Wallace's strong performance of 19 points, 20 rebounds, 3 blocks and 3 steals. Detroit also won Game 2, but Toronto won the next two games at home to force a deciding and tightly contested Game 5 in Detroit. With 10.7 {{seconds left in the}} game, and the Raptors down 85–82 with possession of the ball, Childs raced down the court and shot a three-pointer that missed badly, apparently trying to draw a foul on the play, instead of passing to <b>a</b> <b>wide-open</b> Curry. In a post-game locker room interview, Childs repeatedly insisted that the Raptors had been down four points, not three. The Raptors' late-season surge was thus marred by a disappointing playoff exit; the Olajuwon experiment was also a bust, with the 39-year-old averaging career lows in minutes, points and rebounds. Furthermore, Childs, Clark and Curry left the team, ensuring a new-look team for the next season.|$|E

5|$|Nevada and Maryland then {{exchanged}} punts three times, and the Wolf Pack punted it away {{a fourth}} time. In {{the span of}} two series, Kaepernick was sacked three times, once each by linebackers Dave Philistin, Alex Wujciak, and Adrian Moten. As a result, Kaepernick suffered an ankle sprain and played {{the rest of the}} game, but he noticeably favored his uninjured side. The Terps took over on their 47-yard line with 0:29 remaining in the half. Turner completed an eight-yard pass to Ronnie Tyler, and a Nevada hit out-of-bounds resulted in a 15-yard penalty against Nevada and a first down for Maryland. After two incomplete passes, Turner then converted on third down again with a toss to Tyler for 16yards and then once more for 14yards and a touchdown to bring the score to 26–14 in Maryland's favor. The Terps elected to attempt a two-point conversion, and Turner completed a pass to <b>a</b> <b>wide-open</b> Meggett in {{the right side of the}} end zone. With six seconds remaining in the first half, Maryland had a 28–14 lead. Nevada received Maryland's kickoff, but elected to run out the clock and head into halftime.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales {{can also}} be {{affected}} by humans in more indirect ways. For species like the North Atlantic right whale, which migrates {{through some of the}} world's busiest shipping lanes, the biggest threat is from being struck by ships. The Lloyd's mirror effect results in low frequency propeller sounds not being discernible near the surface, where most accidents occur. Combined with spreading and acoustic shadowing effects, {{the result is that the}} whale is unable to hear an approaching vessel before it has been run over or entrapped by the hydrodynamic forces of the vessel's passage. A 2014 study noted that a lower vessel speed correlated with lower collision rates. The ever-increasing amount of ocean noise, including sonar, drowns out the vocalizations produced by whales, notably in the blue whale which produces the loudest vocalization, which makes it harder for them to communicate. Blue whales stop producing foraging D calls once a mid-frequency sonar is activated, even though the sonar frequency range (1–8kHz) far exceeds their sound production range (25–100Hz). Poisoning from toxic substances such as Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) is generally low because of their low trophic level. Some baleen whales can become victims of bycatch, which is especially serious for North Atlantic right whales considering its small number. Right whales feed with <b>a</b> <b>wide-open</b> mouth, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaw, flippers and tail. Some are able to escape, but others remain entangled. If observers notice, they can be successfully disentangled, but others die over a period of months. Other whales, such as humpback whales, {{can also be}} entangled.|$|E

60|$|The {{moment we}} {{attempted}} to retreat the circle closed in upon us, until {{the tips of the}} wings of those nearest to us nearly touched our faces. We beat at them with the stocks of our guns, but there was nothing solid or vulnerable to strike. Then suddenly out of the whizzing, slate-colored circle a long neck shot out, and a fierce beak made a thrust at us. Another and another followed. Summerlee gave a cry and put his hand to his face, from which the blood was streaming. I felt a prod {{at the back of my}} neck, and turned dizzy with the shock. Challenger fell, and as I stooped to pick him up I was again struck from behind and dropped on the top of him. At the same instant I heard the crash of Lord John's elephant-gun, and, looking up, saw one of the creatures with a broken wing struggling upon the ground, spitting and gurgling at us with <b>a</b> <b>wide-opened</b> beak and blood-shot, goggled eyes, like some devil in a medieval picture. Its comrades had flown higher at the sudden sound, and were circling above our heads.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the unusual}} pawn {{structure}} White attains by playing g4 and c4 {{so early in}} the game, there is frequently little advantage to castling.

25|$|Pendergast may bear {{comparison}} to various big-city bosses, but his open alliance with hardened criminals, his cynical subversion {{of the democratic}} process, his monarchistic style of living, his increasingly insatiable gambling habit, his grasping for a business empire, and his promotion of Kansas City as <b>a</b> <b>wide-open</b> town with every kind of vice imaginable, combined with his professed compassion {{for the poor and}} very real role as city builder, made him bigger than life, difficult to characterize.|$|E
25|$|If {{the first}} quarter was a minor struggle, {{the rest of the}} game was {{relatively}} easy for the Buccaneers, as signified by the first play of the second period. Brad Johnson, who had yet another strong day, pump-faked left from the Bengals’ 35-yard line, drawing coverage away from Rickey Dudley {{down the middle of the}} field. Johnson then lofted a perfect pass to <b>a</b> <b>wide-open</b> Dudley for a 35-yard touchdown. It was Dudley's second score in two games as a Buccaneer.|$|E

5|$|In trap-building species, an average-sized larva digs a pit about 2in (5cm) {{deep and}} 3in (7.5cm) wide at the edge. This {{behavior}} {{has also been}} observed in the Vermileonidae (Diptera), whose larvae dig {{the same sort of}} pit to feed on ants. Having marked out the chosen site by a circular groove, the antlion larva starts to crawl backwards, using its abdomen as a plough to shovel up the soil. By the aid of one front leg, it places consecutive heaps of loosened particles upon its head, then with a smart jerk throws each little pile clear of the scene of operations. Proceeding thus, it gradually works its way from the circumference towards the center. As it slowly moves round and round, the pit gradually gets deeper and deeper, until the slope angle reaches the critical angle of repose (that is, the steepest angle the sand can maintain, where it {{is on the verge of}} collapse from slight disturbance). When the pit is completed, the larva settles down at the bottom, buried in the soil with only the jaws projecting above the surface, often in <b>a</b> <b>wide-opened</b> position on either side of the very tip of the cone. The steep-sloped trap that guides prey into the larva's mouth while avoiding crater avalanches is one of the simplest and most efficient traps in the animal kingdom.|$|R

25|$|In the 1991 preseason, Vikings coach Jerry Burns demoted Gannon to third-string and {{elevated}} Sean Salisbury to second-string behind Wade Wilson. Gannon played {{his first game}} of the year in Week 5 (September 29) against the Denver Broncos, replacing Wade Wilson with 7:20 left in the fourth quarter after Wilson threw three interceptions. On fourth down and three yards (fourth-and-three) at Denver's 13-yard line with 43 seconds left, <b>a</b> <b>wide-open</b> Hassan Jones dropped Gannon's pass, and Minnesota lost 13-6. Gannon would replace Wilson as starter for the last 11 games of 1991, and the Vikings went 6-5 with Gannon as starter for an overall 8-8 season. Gannon was 211-for-354 in completed passes for 2,166 yards, 12 touchdowns, and 6 interceptions. He was sacked 19 times for 91 yards and rushed 43 times for 236 yards, including two rushing touchdowns.|$|E
25|$|USC led 7–0 {{three minutes}} into the game after Anthony Sarao intercepted Hundley and {{returned}} it 17 yards for a touchdown. After the Trojans' Nelson Agholor fumbled a punt at the USC 10, <b>a</b> <b>wide-open</b> Devin Lucien caught a TD to even the score from the Bruins. UCLA scored again 39 seconds later when Duarte turned a mid-range pass from Hundley into a 57-yard TD. After USC tied the game at 14, Eric Kendricks intercepted a tipped pass from Cody Kessler, which Hundley converted into a 68-yard TD drive for a 24–14 lead before the half ended. Paul Perkins scored from 10 yards out to cap an 84-yard drive to start the second half, and Hundley ran 15-yards up the middle midway through the third quarter for the Bruins' final score. With the game in hand for the Bruins, the Trojans gained 91 of their 276 total yards in the game on a meaningless TD drive.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{she named}} Ramon V. Mitra, {{a friend of}} her husband Ninoy and then Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives, as her {{candidate}} for the presidential race in 1992. However, she later on backtracked and instead threw her support behind the candidacy of her defense secretary and EDSA Revolution hero, General Fidel V. Ramos, who constantly stood by and defended her government from the various coup attempts and rebellions that were launched against her. Her sudden change of mind and withdrawal of support from Mitra drew criticism not only from her supporters in the liberal and social democratic sectors {{but also from the}} Roman Catholic Church, which questioned her anointing of Ramos since the latter was a Protestant. Nevertheless, Aquino's candidate eventually won the 1992 elections, albeit with only 23.58% of the total votes in <b>a</b> <b>wide-open</b> campaign, and was sworn in as the 12th President of the Philippines on June 30, 1992.|$|E

But as the ball reached his hands Hamiton's Kusserow hit Casey and he dropped the ball. Winnipeg fans claimed pass interference and Hamilton fans called it a very well timed tackle.

The letters ONC on the wings of the emblem stand for [...] "Ojczyzna, Nauka, Cnota" [...] (Polish for [...] "Homeland, Education, Virtue"). The middle wing with the letter N also symbolizes the compass that should guide every Scout through his or her life.

25|$|After the 2009 season, Corp {{transferred}} to Richmond, and after off-season practices, Mustain became Barkley's back-up for the 2010 season. Before the season, Mustain was diagnosed and started treatment for {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) and head coach Pete Carroll left to coach in the NFL and was replaced by Lane Kiffin, who stuck with Barkley as the starter. Mustain proceeded to back up Barkley until Barkley was injured in the next-to-last game of the season, allowing Mustain to start his first football game since playing at Arkansas in 2006. Starting in the Notre Dame rivalry game, Mustain put up 21-for-38 passes for 183 yards with one interception in a game that became known for a pass that was dropped: In the final two minutes of the game, Mustain threw an accurate pass to <b>a</b> <b>wide-open</b> Ronald Johnson that would have resulted in a touchdown and the probable win, but Johnson bobbled the ball and dropped it. Moments after the drop, Mustain threw his only interception of the game to seal the loss.|$|E
25|$|WVU {{entered the}} game as 7-point underdogs to the #3 Oklahoma Sooners, who were thought {{by some to be}} {{the best team in the}} country. Former head coach Rich Rodriguez had {{recently}} taken the head coaching position at the University of Michigan, leaving West Virginia with interim head coach Bill Stewart. West Virginia halfback Steve Slaton was taken out of the game early on with a hamstring injury, leaving the Mountaineers with freshman Noel Devine. West Virginia scored early with two field goals by Pat McAfee to take the lead, 6–0, into the second quarter. Sam Bradford was intercepted by Mountaineer safety Quinton Andrews early on, but the Sooners bounced back with a field goal to make it 6–3. However, fullback Owen Schmitt led the Mountaineers to their first touchdown on a 57-yard run to make the score 13–3. Oklahoma returned with a field goal to make it 13–6, but West Virginia ended the first half with a pass from their star quarterback, Pat White to <b>a</b> <b>wide-open</b> Darius Reynaud for a 21-yard touchdown to make it 20–6 at halftime. Linebacker Reed Williams won the Defensive MVP award, while backup linebacker J.T. Thomas recorded 6 tackles.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{incident}} in Havana, Birnbaum was {{in the starting lineup}} when NYCFC came to RFK in the final home game of the regular season for DC. Playing before an announced crowd of over 30,000, United played as strong a half as the team had at any time under Coach Ben Olsen. Patrick Mullins put DC out in front as he finished a Lloyd Sam cross in the 27th minute. Four minutes later, Boswell headed in a Sam corner kick to give the home team a much deserved 2-0 lead. Just before halftime, a defensive error allowed United to extend the lead to 3-0. An errant back pass found its way to Mullins, who then found Rob Vincent {{at the top of the}} box, leaving Vincent with <b>a</b> <b>wide-open</b> goal to shoot at for his second MLS goal. NYCFC got one back after the 70' mark, when David Villa drew a soft penalty call, and then beat Hamid on the penalty kick. The 3-1 win clinched a postseason spot for United and left them a point ahead of Montreal in the race for 4th place and a home-field advantage in the play-in game.|$|E

His touchdown record would stay in place until Doug Flutie surpassed him in 1993. He was named an all-star and won the CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award. In 1968, after a season comprising 4,333 yards passing and 31 touchdowns (though with 28 interceptions), he led his team to the 56th Grey Cup, losing a close and exciting game to the Ottawa Rough Riders.
