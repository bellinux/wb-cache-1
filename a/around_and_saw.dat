25|$|The Guru {{stayed in}} the Ashram for two days, went <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> all {{arrangements}} and joined the community meal. The volunteers felt, not {{the presence of a}} formal visitor, but the presence of an intimate advisor and an elderly leader. His presence and appreciation gave them renewed spirit and sense of commitment. The Guru was extremely happy to see a Pulaya boy in the kitchen to help the cooks. He was glad the seeds sown by him were proliferating and bearing fruit. The SNDP had most willingly taken over the task of supplying manpower for the endeavor, and continued to support until the Satyagraha was withdrawn.|$|E

So we came to A Hard Day's Night." ...|$|E

It was shot on two Saturdays {{in the heart of}} downtown Chicago. The first day was during a real parade, and John got some very long shots. Then radio stations carried announcements inviting people to take part in 'a John Hughes movie'. The word got around fast and 10,000 people showed up! For the final shot, I turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> a river of people. I put my hands {{up at the end of}} the number and heard this huge roar. I can understand how rock stars feel. That kind of reaction feeds you." ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 4, 1947, seven-year-old Angela Volpini was grazing cattle {{near her}} {{hometown}} of Casanova Staffora, near Oltrepò Pavese in northwest Italy, when she felt someone embrace her from behind and lift her up. Assuming it was her aunt, she turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> [...] "a woman's face – beautiful, sweet and unknown." [...] The apparitions occurred {{on the fourth day}} of every month for ten years, and many were filmed. Volpini's father supported her, but her mother, while believing in the apparitions, feared for the girl's life. The local priest, Gianni Baget Bozzo, believed the child and formed a lifelong friendship with her. He often compared the apparitions to those of Our Lady of Lourdes. On his death May 8, 2009, he left one-sixth of his fortune to Volpini. People who believe in Volpini's experiences formed a devotional organization called Nova Cana—the name invented by Volpini herself—to commemorate the events.|$|E
2500|$|The {{legend of}} Miaoshan usually ends with Miaozhuangyan, Miaoshan's father, falling ill with jaundice. No {{physician}} {{was able to}} cure him. Then a monk appeared saying that the jaundice could be cured by making a medicine out of the arm and eye of one without anger. The monk further suggested that such a person could be found on Fragrant Mountain. When asked, Miaoshan willingly offered up her eyes and arms. Miaozhuangyan was cured of his illness {{and went to the}} Fragrant Mountain to give thanks to the person. When he discovered that his own daughter had made the sacrifice, he begged for forgiveness. The story concludes with Miaoshan being transformed into the Thousand Armed Guanyin, and the king, queen and her two sisters building a temple on the mountain for her. [...] She began her journey to a pure land and was about to cross over into heaven when she heard a cry of suffering from the world below. [...] She turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> the massive suffering endured by the people of the world.
