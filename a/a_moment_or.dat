500|$|Reviewing {{the episode}} [...] "Counterfeit", Gutierrez wrote that [...] "...despite {{the fact that}} the having an exact twin of Tessa's pop up is flatly ludicrous, it plays out due to MacLeod's desire to have Tessa back {{overriding}} his sense of reason. (...) Vandernoot likes the Tessa character quite a bit and gave me the impression she was sad to see her go," [...] and that she [...] "...looks like she enjoys playing the good/bad Lisa. Her triple performance as Tessa shows Vandernoot's range." [...] Kathie Huddleston of Scifi.com felt that [...] "...a visit from Tessa in [...] "Counterfeit", even an evil Tessa look-alike, is a welcome nod to a significant character from the first season, and it gave our boy Duncan <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> two to reflect on his recent lost love." ...|$|E
500|$|Starting in 1967 and {{continuing}} until 1986, the Albanian government {{carried out a}} policy of [...] "bunkerisation" [...] that saw the construction {{of hundreds of thousands}} of bunkers across the country. They were built in every possible location, ranging from [...] "beaches and mountains, in vineyards and pastures, in villages and towns, even on the manicured lawns of Albania's best hotel". Hoxha envisaged Albania fighting a two-front war against an attack mounted by Yugoslavia, NATO or the Warsaw Pact involving a simultaneous incursion by up to eleven enemy airborne divisions. As he put it, [...] "If we slackened our vigilance even for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> toned down our struggle against our enemies in the least, they would strike immediately like the snake that bites you and injects its poison before you are aware of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Clayson approves of {{the more}} [...] "understated {{production}} aesthetic" [...] next to what he views as an at-times [...] "bloated" [...] sound found elsewhere on All Things Must Pass. Simon Leng also acknowledges Harrison's success in [...] "temper Phil Spector's taste for the extreme" [...] and describes [...] "Behind That Locked Door" [...] {{as one of its}} composer's [...] "more attractive" [...] songs, with a fine lead vocal. [...] " [...] is refreshing to hear Harrison singing about another's pain," [...] Leng adds, [...] "suggesting that, unlike some of his contemporaries, he was able to displace himself as the center of his universe for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> two at least." [...] In his book Phil Spector: Out of His Head, Richard Williams identifies [...] "Behind That Locked Door" [...] as an example of [...] "how sympathetic to the performer" [...] Spector could be as a producer, in this case, by giving the recording a [...] "mellow, autumnal mix" [...] that [...] "beautifully display" [...] Drake's pedal steel.|$|E

500|$|Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film 3.5 out of 4 stars, praising Thompson and Kendrick's {{performances}} and the film's honesty and plausibility. He suspected that [...] "a lot {{of high school}} students will recognize elements of real life in the movie." [...] Bruce Feld of Film Journal International agreed, calling the film a [...] "dead-on revelation of what high school is really like". Variety magazine's Justin Chang thought that Blitz displayed a [...] "terrific ability to embrace people's idiosyncrasies, real or fictitious" [...] and called the cast a [...] "strong ensemble", commending Thompson, Kendrick and D'Agosto in particular. The San Francisco Chronicles Peter Hartlaub thought that the script [...] "never fails to present an unexpected scenario– usually accompanied by <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> two of hilarity", but felt that Hal's ultimate failure was anticlimactic and [...] "frustrating for moviegoers who prefer tidy endings". Stephen Holden, however, writing for The New York Times, believed that the final scenes were a [...] " [...] sign of the movie's integrity". TV Guides Ken Fox similarly admired the more [...] "real" [...] ending, and wrote that the film was [...] "sharp, observant... wonderfully dry". Desson Thomson of The Washington Post praised Blitz for straying from common stereotypes and [...] "opt for deeper, darker and wittier developments".|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{traditional}} apprenticeships in China and Japan, Jikihara encouraged Hofmann {{to create}} his own compositions and develop his own style. [...] "Even while his drawings are so much imbued with Japanese style, they have a vivacity of line, stroke and expression which is very personal." [...] With time, Hofmann’s work branched out into oils and other media and his brushwork began to push traditional limits. He also introduced [...] "subjects not common to the sumi-e genre, like erotic nudes and urban landscapes." [...] His paintings’ [...] "bold strokes, forceful gestures and energy… catch <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>or</b> a mood undistracted" [...] making [...] "emotions palpable." ...|$|E
