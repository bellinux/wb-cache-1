This is where {{information about the}} person is only shared with others after permission of the person, unless it is felt that the information must be shared {{to comply with a}} higher duty such as preserving life. Related to information giving is the debate relating to truth telling in interactions with the person in care. There is a balance between people having the information required to make an autonomous decision and, on the other hand, not being unnecessarily distressed by the truth. Generally the balance is in favour of truth telling due to respect for autonomy, but sometimes people will ask not to be told, or may lack the capacity to understand the implications. Finally, the role of empirical ethics has become prominent in recent years.|$|E
25|$|Proliferation resistance. In 2016, Nobel Laureate {{physicist}} Dr Carlo Rubbia, former Director General of CERN, {{claimed a}} {{primary reason for}} the United States cutting thorium reactor research in the 1970s {{is what makes it}} so attractive today: thorium is difficult to turn into a nuclear weapon.The LFTR resists diversion of its fuel to nuclear weapons in four ways: first, the thorium-232 breeds by converting first to protactinium-233, which then decays to uranium-233. If the protactinium remains in the reactor, small amounts of U-232 are also produced. U-232 has a decay chain product (thallium-208) that emits powerful, dangerous gamma rays. These are not a problem inside a reactor, but in a bomb, they complicate bomb manufacture, harm electronics and reveal the bomb's location. The second proliferation resistant feature {{comes from the fact that}} LFTRs produce very little plutonium, around 15kg per gigawatt-year of electricity (this is the output of a single large reactor over a year). This plutonium is also mostly Pu-238, which makes it unsuitable for fission bomb building, due to the high heat and spontaneous neutrons emitted. The third track, a LFTR doesn't make much spare fuel. It produces at most 9% more fuel than it burns each year, and it's even easier to design a reactor that makes only 1% more fuel. With this kind of reactor, building bombs quickly will take power plants out of operation, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> easy indication of national intentions. And finally, use of thorium can reduce and eventually eliminate the need to enrich uranium. Uranium enrichment is one of the two primary methods by which states have obtained bomb making materials.|$|E

Walsh emphasized to Bloomberg BusinessWeek that edits which {{serve the interests of}} organizations are acceptable, but must be within the procedure of [...] "adding valuable context" [...] to articles. In a statement to The Wall Street Journal, Walsh said, [...] "This is about people reducing the hostility around the topic, and getting the articles back to a state where they make sense. I think the arbitration committee wants to send the message that Wikipedians have to be neutral on all accounts and all fronts. They don't take these situations lightly. They understand there's a perspective of: Are we censoring people or individuals? It's really about what can we do that's best for Wikipedia and the people who read it." [...] When asked by Ross Reynolds of National Public Radio affiliate KUOW-FM why the Arbitration decision included a [...] "ban on IP addresses at the Church of Scientology", Walsh answered, [...] "So the simple answer is that within looking at these computers and where these edits were coming from, the decision is that ultimately most of the edits within these ranges have been from single-user-accounts, people who have a single intention to change or move or in some cases remove information, which could be considered censorship, which is really something that doesn't work out well on Wikipedia. <b>And</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> effort to kind of calm that effect, and to bring some neutrality and some quality back to these articles." ...|$|E

[...] The 2600 Spider had styling which was seen to be derivative of that of its smaller stablemate, the Giulietta Spider: certainly handsome, but lacking the smaller car's grace and balance. [...] The larger car's handling also suffered perhaps unfair comparison {{with that of the}} Giulietta Spider, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> important factor in a car with sporting pretensions.

2500|$|Studies {{have shown}} that some chondrichthyans can {{regenerate}} rhodopsin by cellular regeneration, micro RNA organ regeneration, teeth physiological teeth regeneration, and reparative skin regeneration. Rhodopsin regeneration has been studied in skates and rays. After complete photo-bleaching, rhodopsin can completely regenerate within 2 hours in the retina. [...] White bamboo sharks can regenerate at least two-thirds of their liver {{and this has been}} linked to three micro RNAs, xtr-miR-125b, fru-miR-204, and has-miR-142-3p_R-. In one study two thirds of the liver was removed and within 24 hours {{more than half of the}} liver had undergone hypertrophy. [...] Leopard sharks routinely replace their teeth every 9–12 days [...] <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> example of physiological regeneration. This can occur because shark teeth are not attached to a bone, but instead are developed within a bony cavity. [...] It has been estimated that the average shark loses about 30,000 to 40,000 teeth in a lifetime. [...] Some sharks can regenerate scales and even skin following damage. Within two weeks of skin wounding the mucus is secreted into the wound and this initiates the healing process. One study showed that the majority of the wounded area was regenerated within 4 months, but the regenerated area also showed a high degree of variability.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{accounts}} {{of his life}} typically go something like this: Herodotus was born at Halicarnassus around 484BC. There {{is no reason to}} disbelieve the Sudas information about his family: that it was influential and that {{he was the son of}} Lyxes and Dryo, and the brother of Theodorus, and that he was also related to Panyassis [...] an epic poet of the time. The town was within the Persian Empire at that time, making Herodotus a Persian subject, and it may be that the young Herodotus heard local eye-witness {{accounts of}} events within the empire and of Persian preparations for the invasion of Greece, including the movements of the local fleet under the command of Artemisia I of Caria. Inscriptions recently discovered at Halicarnassus indicate that her grandson Lygdamis negotiated with a local assembly to settle disputes over seized property, which is consistent with a tyrant under pressure. His name is not mentioned later in the tribute list of the Athenian Delian League, indicating that there might well have been a successful uprising against him some time before 454BC. The epic poet Panyassis [...] a relative of Herodotus [...] is reported to have taken part in a failed uprising. Herodotus expresses affection for the island of Samos (III,39–60), <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> indication that he might have lived there in his youth. So it is possible that his family was involved in an uprising against Lygdamis, leading to a period of exile on Samos and followed by some personal hand in the tyrant's eventual fall.|$|E

2500|$|In 1958, Crews {{joined the}} UC Berkeley English Department, where he taught for 36 years before {{retiring}} as its chair in 1994. Crews was an anti-war activist from 1965 to about 1970 and advocated draft resistance as co-chair of Berkeley’s Faculty Peace Committee. Though he shared the widespread assumption during the mid-1960s that psychoanalytic theory was a valid account of human motivation {{and was one}} of the first academics to apply that theory systematically to the study of literature, Crews gradually came to regard psychoanalysis as a pseudoscience. This convinced him that his loyalty should not belong to any theory but rather to empirical standards and the skeptical point of view. Throughout his career, Crews has brought his concern for rational discourse to the study of various issues, from the controversy over recovered memory, the credibility of the Rorschach test, and belief in alien abductions to the Theosophical Society, creationism, and “intelligent design.” He has also advocated for clear writing based on standards of sound argument and rhetorical effectiveness rather than adherence to rigid school-book rules. “What interests me is general rationality,” said Crews,General rationality requires us to observe the world carefully, to consider alternative hypotheses to our own hypotheses, to gather evidence in a responsible way, to answer objections. These are habits of mind that science shares with good history, good sociology, good political science, good economics, what have you. And I summarize all this in what I call the [...] "empirical attitude." [...] It's a combination of feeling responsible to the evidence that is available, feeling responsible to go out and find that evidence, including the evidence that is contrary to one's presumptions, and responsibility to be logical with one's self and others. <b>And</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> ideal that is not so much individual as social. The rational attitude doesn't really work when simply applied to one's self. It is something that we owe to each other.|$|E
