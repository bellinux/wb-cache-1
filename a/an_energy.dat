5|$|For an {{electron}} to transition between two different states, e.g. grounded state to first excited level (ionization), it must absorb or emit a photon at <b>an</b> <b>energy</b> matching {{the difference in}} the potential energy of those levels, according to Niels Bohr model, what can be precisely calculated by the Schrödinger equation.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen is not <b>an</b> <b>energy</b> resource, {{except in}} the {{hypothetical}} context of commercial nuclear fusion power plants using deuterium or tritium, a technology presently far from development. The Sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion of hydrogen, but this process is difficult to achieve controllably on Earth. Elemental hydrogen from solar, biological, or electrical sources requires more energy to make than is obtained by burning it, so in these cases hydrogen functions as <b>an</b> <b>energy</b> carrier, like a battery. Hydrogen may be obtained from fossil sources (such as methane), but these sources are unsustainable.|$|E

5|$|Another idea tied to 2012 {{involved}} a geomagnetic reversal (often incorrectly {{referred to as}} a pole shift by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive solar flare, that would release <b>an</b> <b>energy</b> equal to 100billion atomic bombs.

5|$|Another {{project of}} the Laboratory for Nuclear Science was a {{synchrotron}} particle accelerator, {{which was designed to}} accelerate electrons to <b>an</b> <b>energy</b> of 350MeV. The accelerator was funded by the Office of Naval Research and built under the supervision of Ivan A. Getting, who was a professor of electrical engineering and had worked at the Radiation Laboratory on the extremely successful SCR‑584 radar. Although its construction began in 1946, the accelerator had not begun to work by 1949. In response, Zacharias asked Sands to assist. This was Sands's introduction to accelerator physics, and with his help the machine became operational early in 1950.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from its}} {{unstable}} position, Halos {{would have to}} contend with thousands of meteor and micrometeor impacts which would destabilize or destroy the ring; there is no evidence in the games that the installations project <b>an</b> <b>energy</b> shield to prevent this occurrence. Because of the magnetic environment around the gas giant, a Halo would be exposed to high levels of radiation. Earth is protected from such radiation by charged particles created by the planet's magnetic field. Grazier posits that huge conductive cables could run the circumference of a Halo; when an electric current was run through these cables, a protective magnetic environment could be created to sustain life.|$|E

5|$|Each atomic orbital {{corresponds}} to <b>a</b> particular <b>energy</b> {{level of the}} electron. The electron can change its state to <b>a</b> higher <b>energy</b> level by absorbing a photon with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through spontaneous emission, an electron in <b>a</b> higher <b>energy</b> state can drop to <b>a</b> lower <b>energy</b> state while radiating the excess <b>energy</b> as <b>a</b> photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by {{the differences in the}} energies of the quantum states, are responsible for atomic spectral lines.|$|R

5|$|Electrons can {{transfer}} between different orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with <b>an</b> <b>energy</b> {{that matches the}} difference in potential. Other methods of orbital transfer include collisions with particles, such as electrons, and the Auger effect. To escape the atom, {{the energy of the}} electron must be increased above its binding energy to the atom. This occurs, for example, with the photoelectric effect, where an incident photon exceeding the atom's ionization energy is absorbed by the electron.|$|E
5|$|If a bound {{electron}} {{is in an}} excited state, an interacting photon with the proper energy can cause stimulated emission of a photon with a matching energy level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has <b>an</b> <b>energy</b> difference matching {{the energy of the}} interacting photon. The emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized. This physical property is used to make lasers, which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency band.|$|E

Hayden has already led multiple expeditions into Hell, bringing back captive demons and artifacts for study. One artifact was a sarcophagus containing the Doom Slayer (along with his Praetor Suit), whom the demons imprisoned after his earlier rampage through Hell.|$|E
