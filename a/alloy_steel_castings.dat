40|$|A {{commercial}} foundry {{has been}} established which makes extensive use of fluid beds {{in the production of}} heat treated <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> <b>castings.</b> The castings are cooled immediately after solidification by fluidizing the mold sand in which they were cast. Castings are then normalized and tempered in separate fluid bath furnaces with the entire operation being completed within a few hours of pouring. Fluid baths are also used for cooling of spent sand and for quenching of castings. Trial applications with austempering cycles have been conducted with excellent results. A unique fluid bed bath which is used for preheating, weld positioning and post-heating of castings has also been produced. Substantial energy and material handling savings have been obtained. Areas requiring further design and development of fluid bed applications are also described...|$|E

40|$|It is {{commonly}} believed that high <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> <b>castings</b> have inferior corrosion resistance to their wrought counterparts {{as a result}} of the increased amount of microsegregation remaining in the as-cast structure. Homogenization and dissolution heat treatments are often utilized to reduce or eliminate the residual microsegregation and dissolve the secondary phases. Detailed electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and light optical microscopy (LOM) were utilized to correlate the amount of homogenization and dissolution present after various thermal treatments with calculated values and with the resultant corrosion resistance of the alloys. The influence of heat treatment time and temperature on the homogenization and dissolution kinetics were investigated using stainless steel alloys CN 3 MN and CK 3 MCuN. The influence of heat treatment time and temperature on the impact toughness and corrosion reistance of cast stainless steel alloys CF- 3, CF- 3 M, CF- 8, and CF- 8 M was also investigated...|$|E
40|$|Work {{is ongoing}} to {{characterize}} the dimensional variability of steel casting features. Data are being collected from castings produced at representative Steel Founders` Society of America foundries. Initial results based on more than 12, 500 production casting feature measurements are presented for carbon and low <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> <b>castings</b> produced in green sand, no-bake, and shell molds. A comprehensive database of casting, pattern, and feature variables has been developed so that {{the influence of the}} variables on dimensional variability can be determined. Measurement system analysis is conducted to insure that large measurement error is not reported as dimensional variability. Results indicate that the dimensional variability of production casting features is less than indicated in current US (SFSA) and international (ISO) standards. Feature length, casting weight, parting line and molding process all strongly influence dimensional variability. Corresponding pattern measurements indicate that the actual shrinkage amount for casting features varies considerably. This variation in shrinkage will strongly influence the ability of the foundry to satisfy customer dimensional requirements...|$|E

40|$|High {{molybdenum}} {{austenitic stainless}} <b>steel</b> <b>castings</b> are widely accepted for their high strength, excellent weldability, and good corrosion resistance {{over a wide}} range of temperatures in highly oxidizing aqueous and gaseous media in chemical processing and other environments. With their desirable performance, high molybdenum austenitic stainless <b>steel</b> <b>castings</b> are increasingly applied in industry in a similar manner as wrought materials. In general, cast and wrought stainless and high <b>alloy</b> <b>steels</b> are anticipated to possess equivalent resistance to corrosive media, and they are frequently used in conjunction with each other. However, alloying element segregation usually is more evident in castings than in wrought counterparts. Segregation of alloying elements can lead to the formation of secondary phases, such as sigma. Mechanical properties and especially the corrosion resistance of castings may be affected by the secondary phases. In addition, improper heat treatment procedures c an also lead to the formation of carbides and secondary phases in high alloy and austenitic stainless steels...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} project investigated yield improvement and defect reduction techniques in steel casting. Research and technology development {{was performed in}} the following three specific areas: (1) Feeding rules for high <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> castings; (2) Unconventional yield improvement and defect reduction techniques [...] (a) Riser pressurization; and (b) Filling with a tilting mold; and (3) Modeling of reoxidation inclusions during filling of <b>steel</b> <b>castings.</b> During {{the preparation of the}} proposal for this project, these areas were identified by the High Alloy Committee and Carbon and Low Alloy Committee of the Steel Founders' Society of America (SFSA) as having the highest research priority to the steel foundry industry. The research in each of the areas involved a combination of foundry experiments, modeling and simulation. Numerous SFSA member steel foundries participated in the project through casting trials and meetings. The technology resulting from this project will result in decreased scrap and rework, casting yield improvement, and higher quality <b>steel</b> <b>castings</b> produced with less iteration. This will result in considerable business benefits to steel foundries, primarily due to reduced energy and labor costs, increased capacity and productivity, reduced lead-time, and wider use and application of <b>steel</b> <b>castings.</b> As estimated using energy data provided by the DOE, the technology produced {{as a result of this}} project will result in an energy savings of 2. 6 x 10 {sup 12 } BTU/year. This excludes the savings that were anticipated from the mold tilting research. In addition to the energy savings, and corresponding financial savings this implies, there are substantial environmental benefits as well.
