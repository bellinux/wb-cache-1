5|$|If {{the late}} queen would have {{believed}} her men of war as she did her scribes, we had in her time beaten that great empire in pieces and made their kings of figs <b>and</b> <b>oranges</b> as in old times. But her Majesty did all by halves, and by petty invasions taught the Spaniard how to defend himself, and to see his own weakness.|$|E
5|$|To save money, many sets, {{particularly}} interiors, were redresses {{of existing}} sets. The Enterprise bridge was reconfigured {{to stand in}} for the Grissom, with the chairs reupholstered and the central computer consoles moved to modify the floor plan. An Earth bar and the Klingon medical bay were redresses of the Enterprise sickbay. The Klingon bridge was a set that Nimoy appropriated from another production. Many blinking consoles were rented from a props company rather than being fabricated. The Enterprise bridge itself remained largely unchanged from its appearance in the previous films, though the floor was repainted from black to grey to make it photograph better. The most drastic change was made to Spock's quarters. Nimoy had felt the previous grey color scheme did not express a Vulcan style, and had it brightened with yellows <b>and</b> <b>oranges.</b>|$|E

5|$|Carabane, {{also known}} as Karabane, is an island and a village located in the extreme {{south-west}} of Senegal, {{in the mouth of}} the Casamance River. This relatively recent geological formation consists of a shoal and alluvium to which soil is added by accumulation in the branches and roots of the mangrove trees which cover most of the island. Along with the rest of Ziguinchor Region, Carabane has a tropical climate, cycling between a dry season and a wet season. The island was once considered an arid location where no useful plants were likely to grow, but it now supports several types of fruit tree, the most common of which are mangos <b>and</b> <b>oranges.</b> Although the nearby Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have been closed for years because of the Casamance Conflict, Carabane has continued to attract ornithologists interested in its wide variety of birds. Various species of fish are plentiful around the island, but there are very few mammals.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} the {{maritime}} fur trade on native Hawaiians {{was similar to that}} of the North West Coast natives, but more powerfully transformative. The Hawaiians were generally receptive to Western incursion and settlement. The rise of King KamehamehaI and the unification of the islands under his rule were made possible in part by the effects of the maritime fur trade and its larger Pacific scope. The influx of wealth and technology helped make the new Kingdom of Hawaii relatively strong, in political and economic terms. Many non-native foodstuffs were introduced to the Hawaiian Islands during the early trading era, including plants such as beans, cabbage, onions, squash, pumpkins, melons, <b>and</b> <b>oranges,</b> as well as cash crops like tobacco, cotton, and sugar. Animals introduced included cattle, horses, sheep, and goats. Due to its high fertility Oahu became the most important of the islands. By the 1820s the population of Honolulu was over 10,000. The native Hawaiian population suffered waves of epidemic disease, including cholera. The availability of alcohol, especially grog and gin, led to widespread boozing and an increased use of traditional kava intoxication. These health issues, plus warfare related to the unification of the islands, droughts, and sandalwooding taking precedence over farming all contributed to an increase in famines and a general population decline. By 1850 the native population had dropped by perhaps 50%.|$|E

25|$|At the 1979 Convention, Booth asked {{delegates to}} make 1980 a “test year” for negotiations.

50|$|Today, the {{different}} municipalities of the Oranges {{are quite different}} from one another. All four were once among the richest communities in New Jersey. However, <b>Orange</b> <b>and</b> East <b>Orange</b> are relatively urban and working-class, while South <b>Orange</b> <b>and</b> West <b>Orange</b> remain affluent suburban enclaves. In addition, the residents of <b>Orange</b> <b>and</b> East <b>Orange</b> are predominantly African American (75.1% and 89.5%, respectively), while those of South <b>Orange</b> <b>and</b> West <b>Orange</b> are predominantly white.|$|R

25|$|Agriculture is {{the main}} {{industry}} in the province, together with rice, corn, fruits and vegetables as major crops. Nueva Vizcaya is a major producer of citrus crops in the country, principally pomelo, ponkan <b>and</b> <b>oranges.</b> The Nueva Vizcaya Agricultural Terminal in Bambang supplies the demand of neighboring provinces and Metro Manila. There is a mining industry in the province which added to the provincial income.|$|E
25|$|The Hibbard-Swenson Company diesel {{auxiliary}} schooner Kamchatka (formerly the whaling bark Thrasher) {{was lost}} to fire in the Bering Sea April 14, 1921.

From the beginning, the Knicks home uniforms are in white with blue <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> trim, while the away uniforms are in blue with <b>orange</b> <b>and</b> white trim. The first iterations contain monotone lettering in blue (home) <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> (away) lettering, {{with the addition of}} a checkerboard pattern during the mid-1950s.|$|R
50|$|Primates have re-developed {{trichromatic}} {{color vision}} since that time, by {{the mechanism of}} gene duplication, being under unusually high evolutionary pressure to develop color vision better than the mammalian standard. Ability to perceive red <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> hues allows tree-dwelling primates to discern them from green. This is particularly important for primates in the detection of red <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> fruit, as well as nutrient-rich new foliage, in which the red <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> carotenoids {{have not yet been}} masked by chlorophyll.|$|R

25|$|Citrus, dates, and grapes are {{the main}} fruits by {{cultivated}} area. Agricultural output in tons in 1999 included corn, 9,350,000; wheat, 6,347,000; rice, 5,816,000; potatoes, 1,900,000; <b>and</b> <b>oranges,</b> 1,525,000. The government exercises a strong degree of control over agriculture, not only to ensure {{the best use of}} irrigation water but also to confine the planting of cotton in favor of food grains. However, the government's ability to achieve this objective is limited by crop rotational constraints.|$|E
25|$|Black-and-white film in {{that era}} was {{sensitive}} to blue light, not the reds <b>and</b> <b>oranges</b> of hot steel, {{so she could see}} the beauty, but the photographs were coming out all black. She solved this problem by bringing along a new style of magnesium flare, which produces white light, and having assistants hold them to light her scenes. Her abilities resulted in some of the best steel factory photographs of that era, which earned her national attention.|$|E

Jelgava is dominated by an oppressive and reactionary aristocracy, and is ruled by the odious King Donalitu who was replaced by Algarvian King Mezentio's brother when the nation was occupied by Algarve (in this case, based more closely on the Napoleonic Wars than on World War II). Jelgava has a subtropical climate where olives <b>and</b> <b>oranges</b> grow, and is separated {{from the rest of}} the continent by a high mountain chain. The capital of Jelgava is Balvi.|$|E
25|$|While {{the green}} glazed ware {{continues}} to be Atzompa's staple product, {{there has been some}} innovation in the pottery tradition here. In the 1970s, a local potter by the name of Dolores Porras gained notoriety when she went against convention and pioneered the production of multicolored glazed pottery. Porras taught herself how to paint on clay pieces, starting with red and white washes. Later she added blues, greens, grays <b>and</b> <b>oranges.</b> When she began to produce these pieces, she was considered to be crazy. However, her pieces began to sell and other potters began to imitate her work. Later on, she introduced the use of lead-free glazes. Today, her pieces are part of Atzompa's pottery traditions even though she herself is outsold by younger potters who produce cheaper and better wares.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, fashion had {{moved away from}} the unkempt hippie look and overdressed disco style of the late 1970s. Athletic clothes were more popular than jeans during this period, as were more subdued colors. Popular colors were black, white, indigo, forest green, burgundy, and {{different}} shades of browns, tans, <b>and</b> <b>oranges.</b> Velour, velvet, and polyester were popular fabrics used in clothes, especially button-up and v-neck shirts. Looser pants remained popular during this time, being fairly wide but straight, and tighter shirts were especially popular. The general public, at this time, wanted to wear low-maintenance clothing with more basic colors, as the global recession going on at the time kept extravagant clothes out of reach. Also worn were striped tube socks sometimes worn with the top folded over worn with shorts. It was not uncommon to see parents especially fathers wearing these along with their kids.|$|E
