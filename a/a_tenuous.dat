5|$|Saturn has 62 known moons, 53 {{of which}} have formal names. In addition, there is {{evidence}} of dozens to hundreds of moonlets with diameters of 40–500 meters in Saturn's rings, which are not considered to be true moons. Titan, the largest moon, comprises more than 90% of the mass in orbit around Saturn, including the rings. Saturn's second-largest moon, Rhea, may have <b>a</b> <b>tenuous</b> ring system of its own, along with <b>a</b> <b>tenuous</b> atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Infrared {{spectroscopy}} conducted from 2001 to 2005 {{revealed the}} presence of water ice as well as frozen carbon dioxide {{on the surface of}} Titania, which in turn suggested that the moon may have <b>a</b> <b>tenuous</b> carbon dioxide atmosphere with a surface pressure of about 10 nanopascals (10−13 bar). Measurements during Titania's occultation of a star put an upper limit on the surface pressure of any possible atmosphere at 1–2 mPa (10–20 nbar).|$|E
5|$|Slightly {{smaller than}} Earth's Moon, Europa is {{primarily}} made of silicate rock {{and has a}} water-ice crust and probably an iron–nickel core. It has <b>a</b> <b>tenuous</b> atmosphere composed primarily of oxygen. Its surface is striated by cracks and streaks, whereas craters are relatively rare. In addition to Earth-bound telescope observations, Europa has been examined by a succession of space probe flybys, the first occurring in the early 1970s.|$|E
6000|$|That was pleasing: <b>a</b> thin, <b>tenuous</b> membrane. It had {{the right}} {{anatomical}} quality. Tight blown, quivering in the blast of noisy life. It was {{time for him to}} descend from the serene empyrean of words into the actual vortex. He went down slowly. [...] "My soul is <b>a</b> thin, <b>tenuous</b> membrane..." ...|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, the {{presence}} of <b>a</b> very hot, <b>tenuous</b> gas surrounding the Sun was inferred indirectly from optical coronal lines of highly ionized species. The Sun {{has been known to}} be surrounded by <b>a</b> hot <b>tenuous</b> corona. In the mid-1940s radio observations revealed a radio corona around the Sun.|$|R

5|$|The Pied-Noir {{relationship}} with France and Algeria {{was marked by}} alienation. The settlers considered themselves French, {{but many of the}} Pieds-Noirs had <b>a</b> <b>tenuous</b> connection to mainland France, which 28 percent of them had never visited. The settlers encompassed a range of socioeconomic strata, ranging from peasants to large landowners, the latter of whom were referred to as grands colons.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} {{of carbon dioxide}} on the surface suggests that Titania may have <b>a</b> <b>tenuous</b> seasonal atmosphere of CO2, much {{like that of the}} Jovian moon Callisto. Other gases, like nitrogen or methane, are unlikely to be present, because Titania's weak gravity could not prevent them from escaping into space. At the maximum temperature attainable during Titania's summer solstice (89 K), the vapor pressure of carbon dioxide is about 300 μPa (3 nbar).|$|E
5|$|When the American Revolutionary War {{began in}} 1775, the Ohio River marked <b>a</b> <b>tenuous</b> {{border between the}} American colonies and the American Indians of the Ohio Country. Ohio Indians—Shawnees, Mingos, Delawares, and Wyandots—were divided over {{how to respond to}} the war. Some Indian leaders urged neutrality, while others entered the war because they saw it as an {{opportunity}} to halt the expansion of the American colonies and to regain lands previously lost to the colonists.|$|E
50|$|IC 5332 is a {{late type}} spiral galaxy with {{observable}} star formation ongoing, though {{at such a}} low rate as to be a stable non-starburst galaxy. It is <b>a</b> somewhat <b>tenuous</b> spiral galaxy with a very low surface brightness of just 23.8 mag/squ arc sec.|$|R
2500|$|Recent [...] "magic realism" [...] {{has gone}} beyond mere [...] "overtones" [...] of the fantastic or surreal to depict a frankly magical reality, with <b>an</b> {{increasingly}} <b>tenuous</b> anchoring in [...] "everyday reality".

5|$|After Chickamauga, Rosecrans and his Army of the Cumberland {{retreated to}} {{fortified}} Chattanooga. Bragg held an ineffective siege against Chattanooga, {{but refused to}} take any further action as the Union forces there were reinforced by Ulysses S. Grant and reopened <b>a</b> <b>tenuous</b> supply line. Many of Bragg's subordinates, including Buckner, advocated that Bragg be relieved of command. Thomas L. Connelly, historian of the Army of Tennessee, believes that Buckner {{was the author of}} the anti-Bragg letter sent by the generals to President Jefferson Davis. Bragg retaliated by reducing Buckner to division command and abolishing the Department of East Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|French and Indian raids had resumed in {{the years}} {{following}} Phips' 1690 expeditions, so he sought to improve the province's defenses. Pursuant to his instructions from London, in 1692 he oversaw the construction of a stone fort, which was dubbed Fort William Henry, at Pemaquid (present-day Bristol, Maine), where a wooden fort had been destroyed in 1689. He recruited Major Benjamin Church to lead a 450-man expedition eventually leading to <b>a</b> <b>tenuous</b> peace agreement with the Abenaki people.|$|E
5|$|Observations {{with the}} Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph of the Hubble Space Telescope, first {{described}} in 1995, revealed that Europa has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of molecular oxygen (O2). The surface pressure of Europa's atmosphere is 0.1μPa, or 10−12 {{times that of}} the Earth. In 1997, the Galileo spacecraft confirmed the presence of <b>a</b> <b>tenuous</b> ionosphere (an upper-atmospheric layer of charged particles) around Europa created by solar radiation and energetic particles from Jupiter's magnetosphere, providing evidence of an atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Only {{very late}} {{on the night of}} 15 June was Wellington certain that the Charleroi attack was the main French thrust. In the early hours of 16 June, at the Duchess of Richmond's ball in Brussels, he {{received}} a dispatch from the Prince of Orange and was shocked by the speed of Napoleon's advance. He hastily ordered his army to concentrate on Quatre Bras, where the Prince of Orange, with the brigade of Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, was holding <b>a</b> <b>tenuous</b> position against the soldiers of Ney's left wing.|$|E
5|$|Senator Powell favored Kentucky's {{neutrality}} policy {{during the}} Civil War, but nationally, the conflict {{put him in}} <b>a</b> <b>tenuous</b> political situation. On one hand, he favored a strong national government and a strict interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. On the other hand, he was an opponent of coercion, and due to Kentucky's proximity to the Southern states, maintained a more sympathetic view of the southern cause than legislators from more northern states. During his term as governor, Powell had been critical of Northern states that refused {{to abide by the}} Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{failed to}} {{accomplish}} their objectives {{for the first}} day, but gained <b>a</b> <b>tenuous</b> foothold that they gradually expanded when they captured the port at Cherbourg on 26 June {{and the city of}} Caen on 21 July. A failed counterattack by German forces on 8 August left 50,000 soldiers of the 7th Army trapped in the Falaise pocket. The Allies launched an invasion of southern France (code-named Operation Dragoon) on 15 August, and the Liberation of Paris followed on 25 August. German forces retreated across the Seine on 30 August 1944, marking the close of Operation Overlord.|$|E
50|$|Callisto is the {{outermost}} of the Galilean satellites. It {{is a large}} moon, only slightly smaller than the planet Mercury. It is cold, icy, and heavily cratered, with <b>a</b> very <b>tenuous</b> atmosphere. Despite its size and early discovery, {{it has not been}} featured in fiction as much as the other Galilean satellites.|$|R
50|$|The EAHL {{operated}} between 1933-1948 and 1949-1953. The {{league has}} <b>a</b> somewhat <b>tenuous</b> existence. It began with seven teams, and had various numbers of teams, going {{as low as}} four. There was no 1948-49 season, but the league returned for the 1949-50 season with eight teams. The league again did not operate during the 1953-54 season.|$|R
25|$|Confederate {{soldiers}} were also faced with inadequate food rations, {{especially as the}} war progressed. There was plenty of meat in the Confederacy. The unsolvable problem was shipping it to the armies, especially when Lee's army in Virginia {{was at the end}} of <b>a</b> long, <b>tenuous</b> supply line. Union victory at Vicksburg in 1863 shut off supplies from Texas and the west.|$|R
5|$|Triton {{is one of}} the few moons in the Solar System {{known to}} be geologically active (the others being Jupiter's Io and Saturn's Enceladus). As a consequence, its surface is {{relatively}} young with few obvious impact craters, and a complex geological history revealed in intricate cryovolcanic and tectonic terrains. Part of its surface has geysers erupting sublimated nitrogen gas, contributing to <b>a</b> <b>tenuous</b> nitrogen atmosphere less than 1/70,000 the pressure of Earth's atmosphere at sea level.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the four}} {{surviving}} mutineers, Young and Adams, assumed leadership and secured <b>a</b> <b>tenuous</b> calm, which was disrupted by the drunkenness of McCoy and Quintal after the former distilled an alcoholic beverage from a local plant. Some of the women attempted to leave the island in a makeshift boat, but could not launch it successfully. Life continued uneasily until McCoy's suicide in 1798. A year later, after Quintal threatened fresh murder and mayhem, Adams and Young killed him {{and were able to}} restore peace.|$|E
5|$|After {{six years}} at the Kestrels, the {{defection}} saw Kydd forced {{to adapt to a}} new shooting combination with veteran international Sharelle McMahon. As she had had little opportunity to train with the new team before the opening of the season, the pair initially had some difficulty adjusting to each other's style. After <b>a</b> <b>tenuous</b> start, however, the pair found form, and were able to form a relatively successful combination. Kydd scored 360 goals in the season, and assisted the Phoenix in becoming the top scoring side for the season, although occasionally patchy form from the team as a whole saw the Phoenix slip outside the top two at season's end. Kydd was overlooked for a return to international selection during the 2006–07 season.|$|E
25|$|Mercury has <b>a</b> very <b>tenuous</b> {{and highly}} {{variable}} atmosphere (surface-bound exosphere) containing hydrogen, helium, oxygen, sodium, calcium, potassium and water vapor, {{with a combined}} pressure level of about 10−14 bar (1 nPa). The exospheric species originate either from the Solar wind or from the planetary crust. Solar light pushes the atmospheric gases away from the Sun, creating a comet-like tail behind the planet.|$|R

40|$|The {{atmosphere}} of Mercury, {{like that of}} the moon, is maintained in <b>an</b> extremely <b>tenuous</b> minimum state by weak solar wind accretion and radioactive decay processes, and depleted by strong removal mechanisms. Unlike the moon, it has a high daytime surface temperature that promotes the production of water vapor, which may be the dominant atmospheric constituent derived from solar wind protons...|$|R
5|$|Early that month, the Stavka issued {{orders to}} Southwestern Strategic Direction {{headquarters}} for an offensive in the region, after the victories following the Rostov Strategic Offensive Operation and the Barvenkovo–Lozovaya Offensive Operation in the Donbas region. The forces of Marshal Semyon Timoshenko and Lieutenant General Kirill Moskalenko penetrated German positions {{along the northern}} Donets River, east of Kharkov. Fighting continued into April, with Moskalenko crossing the river and establishing <b>a</b> <b>tenuous</b> bridgehead at Izium. In the south, the Soviet 6th Army had limited success defending against German forces, which managed to keep a bridgehead of their own on the east bank of the river. Catching the attention of Stalin, it set the pace for the prelude to the eventual offensive intended to reach Pavlohrad and Sinelnikovo and eventually Kharkov and Poltava.|$|E
5|$|The Bruneian Empire was {{established}} in the coastal regions of Sarawak by the mid-15th century, and the Kuching area was known to Portuguese cartographers during the 16th century as Cerava, one of the five great seaports of Borneo. It was also during this time that witnessed the birth of the Sultanate of Sarawak, a local kingdom that lasted for almost half a century before being reunited with Brunei in 1641. By the early 19th century, the Bruneian Empire was in decline, retaining only <b>a</b> <b>tenuous</b> hold along the coastal regions of Sarawak which were otherwise controlled by semi-independent Malay leaders. Away from the coast, territorial wars were fought between the Iban and a Kenyah-Kayan alliance.|$|E
5|$|The chaos {{continued}} as other royal guards were found and beaten; {{at least one}} more was killed and his head too appeared atop a pike. Finally, the fury of the attack subsided enough to permit some communication between the former French Guards, who formed the professional core of Lafayette's National Guard militia, and the royal gardes du corps. The units had a history of cooperation and a military sense of mutual respect, and Lafayette, who had been snatching a few hours of sleep in his exhaustion, awoke {{to make the most of}} it. To the relief of the royals, the two sets of soldiers were reconciled by his charismatic mediation and <b>a</b> <b>tenuous</b> peace was established within the palace.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{there have}} been many periods of {{flooding}} in China, one particularly heavy set of floods happened in 29 BCE. The large number of verses in the Forest about flood disasters lead me to believe it was written {{at a time when many}} floods were happening. Thus this is <b>a</b> very <b>tenuous</b> dating parameter, but it cannot be entirely excluded.|$|R
5000|$|Furthermore, {{as there}} is only <b>an</b> {{extremely}} <b>tenuous</b> atmosphere on the Moon, very distant objects will appear clearer {{and closer to the}} human eye. What appears as nearby hills in some photographs, are actually mountains several kilometers high and some 10-20 kilometers away. Changes in such very distant backgrounds are quite subtle, and can be mistaken for no change at all.|$|R
