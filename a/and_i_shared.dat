Laurie Fishlock <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>shared</b> a cabin so small that we could hardly turn round. The ship was 'dry' and on board were some 700 war brides returning to Australia.|$|E
500|$|In November 2016, Madonna, who {{actively}} supported Hillary Clinton {{during the}} 2016 U.S. presidential election, performed an impromptu acoustic concert at Washington Square Park {{in support of}} Clinton's campaign. Upset that Donald Trump won the election, Madonna spoke out against him at the Women's March on Washington, a day after his inauguration. The singer sparked controversy {{when she said that}} she [...] "thought a lot about blowing up the White House". The following day, she asserted she was [...] "not a violent person" [...] and that her quote had been [...] "taken wildly out of context", adding [...] "I spoke in metaphor <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>shared</b> two ways of looking at things — one was to be hopeful, and one was to feel anger and outrage". In February 2017, Madonna adopted four-year-old twin sisters from Malawi named Esther and Stella. In late summer 2017, Madonna moved to Lisbon, Portugal with her adoptive children.|$|E
2500|$|Hunt {{has been}} {{working on a book about}} Jimi Hendrix that she {{considers}} her life work. She indicates that no one alive can share her perspective on the matter, [...] "because he <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>shared</b> something – black Americans who came to London were transformed and re-packaged for the U.S., although I never became successful there and he did."

However, Walker's girlfriend Louise, who was present on the night of his murder, said she never would forgive them adding, [...] "I hate them for what they have done. Anthony <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>shared</b> something special. Now he has been taken away from me by those two evil young men. I still feel that he (Anthony Walker) is around. Yesterday, I sent Anthony a text and just told him he (Barton) had been found guilty. It seemed the natural thing to do." ...|$|E

[...] "I have once been in a railway accident myself, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>share</b> your dislike; but I fear that we couldn't get on well without them now, so you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> must be content to tolerate them, Gertie." ...|$|R
40|$|What are the {{conditions}} that make it possible that you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>share</b> the same world? This is the issue on which I wish to focus this chapter.

60|$|By {{this time}} we were not more than thirty feet astern. Charley was jubilant. He knew our boat was fast, and he knew, further, that in fine sailing few men were his equals.

60|$|Yes, {{it was a}} {{pleasant}} supper, not made less so by {{a bottle of champagne}} which Bickley <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>shared.</b> Bastin stuck to his tea, not because he did not like champagne, but because, as he explained, having now come in contact with the heathen it would never do for him to set them an example in the use of spirituous liquors.|$|E
6000|$|Every effort I made {{to escape}} beggary {{was in the}} end {{frustrated}} by Chong Mong-ju. In Songdo I became a fuel-carrier, and the Lady Om <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>shared</b> a hut that was vastly more comfortable than the open road in bitter winter weather. But Chong Mong-ju found me out, and I was beaten and planked and put out upon the road. That was a terrible winter, the winter poor [...] "What-Now" [...] Vandervoot froze to death {{on the streets of}} Keijo.|$|E

So we went off together, looked her up at her house, stated our case, and collected the stuff. Millie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>shared</b> the work. She did the asking, while I inquired after the rheumatism. She mentioned the figure that would clear us; I patted the dog. Little beast! Got after me when I wasn't looking and chewed my ankle!" ...|$|E
60|$|I went to Rendle's. I {{just missed}} getting into college; I was two places below the lowest {{successful}} boy. I was Maxton's fag to begin with, and my chief chum was Raymond, {{who is your}} friend also, and who comes so often to this house. I preferred water to land, boats to cricket, because of that difficulty about pitch I have already mentioned. But I was no great sportsman. Raymond <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>shared</b> a boat, {{and spent most of}} the time we gave to it under the big trees near Dartpool Lock, reading or talking. We would pull up to Sandy Hall perhaps once a week. I never rowed in any of the eights, though I was urged to do so. I swam fairly well, and got my colors on the strength of my diving.|$|E
6000|$|This {{was a great}} grief to him and to us all. There {{was only}} one side of our lives that was not saddened. Our old {{incumbent}} had died about {{six months after the}} Fordyces had gone, and Mr. Henderson had gladly accepted the living where the parsonage had been built. The lady to whom he had been so long engaged was a great acquisition. [...] Her home had been at Oxford; and she was as thoroughly imbued with the spirit that there prevailed as was the Hillside curate. She talked to us of Littlemore, and of the sermons there and at St. Mary's, and Emily <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>shared</b> to the full her hero-worship. It was the nearest compensation my sister had had for the loss of Ellen, with this difference, that Mrs. Henderson was older, had read more, and had conversed thoughtfully with some of the leading spirits in religious thought, so that she opened a new world to us.|$|E
6000|$|The Indiana {{delegation}} in Congress, or {{at least}} a large part of them, are very anxious that General Milroy shall enter active service again, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>share</b> in this feeling.

50|$|Sebastian {{also worked}} {{sporadically}} as an actor. In 1996, {{he made his}} acting debut in the Mexican soap opera Tú y Yo (You <b>and</b> <b>I),</b> <b>sharing</b> credits with Maribel Guardia, his former wife and mother to his son, Julian.

60|$|However, {{before we}} had gone very far Solivet rode out to meet us. It was another cause of anxiety, {{although}} it was dusk, and he had expected us to have slept at St. Denis and to have arrived the next day, and he asked, what could have made us start so early, just {{as if we had}} been criminals fleeing from justice; but he took us to the chateau where he was quartered, and, though they were much crowded there, the family tried to make us comfortable. The master of the house gave up his own bed to my brother, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>shared</b> that of his mother. 'Jacques' in his character of valet, was to attend on his master, and sleep on the floor; and this gave the only opportunity of exchanging any conversation freely, but even this had to be done with the utmost caution, for the suite of rooms opened into each other, and Solivet, who was very anxious about Eustace, came in and out to see after him, little guessing how much this added to the inward fever of anxiety which banished all sleep from his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|We are all busy in {{this world}} {{building}} Towers of Babel; and the child of our imaginations is always a changeling when it comes from nurse. This is not only true in the greatest, as of wars and folios, but in the least also, like the trifling volume in your hand. Thus I began to write these papers with a definite end: I {{was to be the}} Advocatus, not I hope Diaboli, but Juventutis; I was to state temperately the beliefs of youth as opposed to the contentions of age; to go over all the field where the two differ, and produce at last a little volume of special pleadings which I might call, without misnomer, [...] "Life at Twenty-five." [...] But times kept changing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>shared</b> in the change. I clung hard to that entrancing age; but, with the best will, no man can be twenty-five for ever. The old, ruddy convictions deserted me, and, along with them, the style that fits their presentation and defence. I saw, and indeed my friends informed me, that the game was up. A good part of the volume would answer to the long-projected title; but the shadows of the prison-house are on the rest.|$|E
6000|$|When we had rested a {{while at}} the wagons the {{captured}} beasts were mustered, and on being counted were found to number a little over twelve hundred head, not reckoning animals that had been badly hurt in the flight, which we killed for beef. It was a noble prize, truly, and, notwithstanding the wound in his thigh, which hurt him a good deal now that it had stiffened, Saduko stood up and surveyed them with glistening eyes. No wonder, for he who had been so poor was now rich, and would remain so even after he had paid over whatever number of cows Umbezi chose to demand {{as the price of}} Mameena's hand. Moreover, he was sure, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>shared</b> his confidence, that in these changed circumstances both that young woman and her father would look upon his suit with very favourable eyes. He had, so to speak, succeeded to the title and the family estates by means of a lawsuit brought in the [...] "Court of the Assegai," [...] and therefore there was hardly a father in Zululand who would shut his kraal gate upon him. We forgot, both of us, the proverb that points out how numerous are the slips between the cup and the lip, which, by the way, is one that has its Zulu equivalents. One of them, if I remember right at the moment, is: [...] "However loud the hen cackles, the housewife does not always get the egg." ...|$|E

6000|$|A loud shout {{rose from}} the {{assembled}} knights, for upon {{the return of the}} party who had been away, the rest of those at the auberge had hastily robed themselves and descended to the hall to gather the news. When the shout had died away, and the wine cups were emptied, Gervaise, who was sitting on Sir John Kendall's right hand, would gladly have retained his seat, but the bailiff told him that he must say a few words, and after standing in embarrassed silence for a minute he said, [...] "Sir John Kendall, and brother knights, I can only say that I am very sensible of the kindness with which you have been pleased to regard what seems to me after all to have been a very ordinary affair. I saw a man, whom I knew to be a stranger in the Island, speaking surreptitiously to a slave, and afterwards saw him conversing with a prison officer. That naturally struck me as curious, and I followed the officer, to see to which prison he belonged. Any one would have thought, as I did, that such a thing was strange, if not suspicious, {{and the only way to}} find out whether there was anything in it was to mix with the slaves; as I spoke Turkish well enough to do so I asked Sir John Kendall's permission to disguise myself. He gave me every assistance, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>shared</b> their lot for a fortnight. There was no very great hardship in that--certainly nothing to merit the praise that Sir John Kendall has been kind enough to bestow on me. Nevertheless, I am very glad to have gained your good opinion and very grateful to him and to you for drinking to my health." ...|$|E
6000|$|And so I was; I can't {{say they}} were {{the subject of much}} regret, but I was really sorry to leave our big neighbour, the British Museum, where there were good friends who always made me welcome, and {{encouraged}} me in studies of coins and heraldry, which were great resources to me, so that I used to spend hours there, and was by no means willing to resign my ambition of obtaining an appointment there, when I heard my father say that he was especially thankful for his good fortune because it enabled him to provide for me. [...] There were lessons, too, from masters in languages, music, and drawing, which Emily <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>shared,</b> and which she had just begun to value thoroughly. We had filled whole drawing-books with wriggling twists of foliage in B B B marking pencil, and had just been promoted to water-colours; and she was beginning to sing very prettily. I feared, too, that I should no longer have a chance of rivalling Griffith's university studies. All this, with my sister's girl friends, and those kind people who used to drop in to play chess, and otherwise amuse me, would all be left behind; and, sorest of all, Clarence, who, whatever he was in the eyes of others, had grown to be my mainstay during this last year. He it was who fetched me from the Museum, took me into the gardens, helped me up and down stairs, spared no pains to rout out whatever my fanciful pursuits required from shops in the City, and, in very truth, spoilt me through all his hours that were free from business, besides being my most perfect sympathising and understanding companion.|$|E
60|$|He was of lighter metal {{than most}} {{other members of the}} Dante Club, and he was not of their {{immediate}} intimacy, living away from Cambridge, as he did, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>shared</b> his silence in their presence with full sympathy. I was by far the youngest of their number, and I cannot yet quite make out why I was of it at all. But at every moment I was as sensible of my good fortune as of my ill desert. They were the men whom of all men living I most honored, and it seemed to be impossible that I at my age should be so perfectly fulfilling the dream of my life in their company. Often, the nights were very cold, and as I returned home from Craigie House to the carpenter's box on Sacramento Street, a mile or two away, I was as if soul-borne through the air by my pride and joy, while the frozen blocks of snow clinked and tinkled before my feet stumbling along the middle of the road. I still think that was the richest moment of my life, and I look back at it as the moment, in a life not unblessed by chance, which I would most like to live over again--if I must live any. The next winter the sessions of the Dante Club were transferred to the house of Mr. Norton, who was then completing his version of the 'Vita Nuova'. This has always seemed to me a work of not less graceful art than Longfellow's translation of the 'Commedia'. In fact, it joins the effect of a sympathy almost mounting to divination with a patient scholarship and a delicate skill unknown to me elsewhere in such work. I do not know whether Mr. Norton has satisfied himself better in his prose version of the 'Commedia' than in this of the 'Vita Nuova', but I do not believe he could have satisfied Dante better, unless he had rhymed his sonnets and canzonets. I am sure he might have done this if he had chosen. He has always pretended that it was impossible, but miracles are never impossible in the right hands.|$|E
