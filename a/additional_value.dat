Tornadoes also produce a detectable seismic signature, and research continues on isolating it and understanding the process.|$|E
5|$|Stations {{are divided}} into two areas, paid and unpaid, which allow the rail {{operators}} to collect fares by restricting entry only through the fare gates, also known as access control gates. These gates, connected to a computer network, can read and update electronic tickets capable of storing data, and can store information such as the initial and destination stations and the duration for each trip. General Ticketing Machines sell tickets for single trips or allow the customer to buy <b>additional</b> <b>value</b> for stored-value tickets. Tickets for single trips, coloured in green, are valid only {{on the day of}} purchase, and have a time allowance of 30 minutes beyond the estimated travelling time. Tickets that can be used repeatedly until their expiry date require a minimum amount of stored credit.|$|E

25|$|When {{originally}} constructed, {{the address}} of the building was 2 East 86th Street. During its renovation, the building owners applied to the Manhattan Borough President's office for an address change, citing the fact that all floors above the seventh provide an unobstructed view of Central Park. This was for marketing purposes, due to the <b>additional</b> <b>value</b> that accrues to real estate with a Fifth Avenue address. Such changes are unusual but not unheard of, and are granted if deemed justified.|$|E
500|$|From 1988 onwards, two-legged ties were {{decided on}} points, {{followed}} by goal difference, with an immediate penalty shootout if the tie was level on aggregate after full-time {{in the second}} leg. Starting with the 2005 season, CONMEBOL began to use the away goals rule. In 2008, the finals became {{an exception to the}} away goals rule and employed extra time. From 1995 onwards, the [...] "Three points for a win" [...] standard, a system adopted by FIFA in 1995 that places <b>additional</b> <b>value</b> on wins, was adopted in CONMEBOL, with teams now earning 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss.|$|E

500|$|Some tax protesters {{have cited}} the U.S. Supreme Court {{decision}} {{in the case of}} Eisner v. Macomber for the theory that wages are not taxable, or for the theory that dividends are not taxable. The case dealt with a stock dividend on stock that was essentially equivalent to a stock split, as opposed to a cash dividend on stock. In the case of this kind of [...] "dividend" [...] the stockholder does not receive anything or realize any <b>additional</b> <b>value.</b> For example, if a stockholder owns 100 shares of stock having a value of $4 per share, the total value is $400. If the corporation declares, say, a [...] "two for one" [...] stock dividend that is essentially similar to a stock split (and the corporation distributes no money or other property), the stockholder now has 200 shares with a value of $2 each, which is still $400 in value - i.e., no increase in value and no income. The pie is still the same size [...] but it's sliced into more pieces, each piece being proportionately smaller.|$|E
500|$|As {{the private}} equity {{industry}} expanded through 2006 and 2007, {{several of the}} largest private equity firms, most notably The Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, announced plans to realize value from their firms through the sale of shares in the public equity markets. [...] Apollo Management chose a slightly different path, by completing a private placement of shares in its management company in July 2007. [...] By pursuing a private placement rather than a public offering, Apollo {{would be able to}} avoid much of the public scrutiny applied to Blackstone and KKR. [...] In November 2007, Apollo was able to realize <b>additional</b> <b>value</b> from the sale of a 9% ownership interest in its management company to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA). [...] Ultimately, in April 2008, Apollo would file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to permit some holders of its privately traded stock to sell their shares on the New York Stock Exchange and in March 2011, Apollo completed its initial public offering (...)

2500|$|The {{work of the}} Italian {{physician}} and humanist Ermolao Barbaro was published in 1516, 23 years after his death. Poliziano wrote to Ermalao Barbaro, forwarding a manuscript of the 1st-century pharmacologist Pedanius Dioscorides, asking him to send it back “annotated by that very learned hand of yours, thus lending the volume <b>additional</b> <b>value</b> and authority." [...] Barbaro was professor of the University of Padua in 1477 and translated many texts from Greek to Latin.|$|E
2500|$|To {{compensate}} for having <b>additional</b> <b>value</b> through {{the option to}} convert the bond to stock, a convertible bond typically has a coupon rate {{lower than that of}} similar, non-convertible debt. [...] The investor receives the potential upside of conversion into equity while protecting downside with cash flow from the coupon payments and the return of principal upon maturity. [...] These properties lead naturally to the idea of convertible arbitrage, where a long position in the convertible bond is balanced by a short position in the underlying equity.|$|E
50|$|These stamps {{replaced}} {{stamp duty}} ones. The first adhesive duty stamps were issued in 1918 with {{the portrait of}} King George V. In 1939 this design {{was replaced by a}} numeral type which was reused in 1966 with decimal values ranging from 1c to $200. Reprints and <b>additional</b> <b>values</b> continued until c.1979.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a systematic method for optimizing recursive functions using both indexed and recursive data structures. The method {{is based on}} two critical ideas: first, determining a minimal input increment operation so as to compute a function on repeatedly incremented input; second, determining appropriate <b>additional</b> <b>values</b> to maintain in appropriate data structures, based on what values are needed in computation on an incremented input and how these values can be established and accessed. Once these two are determined, the method extends the original program to return the <b>additional</b> <b>values,</b> derives an incremental version of the extended program, and forms an optimized program that repeatedly calls the incremental program. The method can derive all dynamic programming algorithms found in standard algorithm textbooks. There are many previous methods for deriving efficient algorithms, but none is as simple, general, and systematic as ours...|$|R

2500|$|Despite some {{shortcomings}} in Gerard’s effort, Linnaeus honored {{him in the}} name of the plant genus Gerardia. Gerard’s Herball references many of the poisonous plants mentioned in Shakespeare’s plays. <b>Additional</b> <b>value</b> has been placed on the Herball by students of literature. For example, the herb which produces the deathlike sleep of Juliet or Cymbeline may refer to nightshade, Mandragora or Doronicum, all of them listed and described in the Herball. [...] It has been suggested by historian Mark Griffiths that the image of an unknown man, on the title page of the Herball is in fact Shakespeare himself.|$|E
2500|$|There were 123 {{commemorative}} coins altogether, with face {{values of}} 5, 10 or 20 Mark. The coins were released for various anniversaries or special events.

A complete list of all released commemorative coins {{can be found in the}} [...] "Liste der Gedenkmünzen der DDR". Some of the commemorative coins were produced in very large volumes, especially the one shown above. These coins entered circulation, because they had little or no <b>additional</b> <b>value</b> for collectors due to the large numbers issued.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Stanford {{accounting}} professor Joseph Piotroski {{developed the}} [...] "F-Score", which discriminates higher potential members within {{a class of}} value candidates. The F-Score aims to discover <b>additional</b> <b>value</b> from signals in a firm's series of annual financial statements, after initial screening of static measures like book-to-market value. The F-Score formula inputs financial statements and awards points for meeting predetermined criteria. Piotroski retrospectively analyzed a class of high book-to-market stocks in the period 1976-1996, and demonstrated that high F-Score selections increased returns by 7.5% annually versus the class as a whole. [...] The American Association of Individual Investors examined 56 screening methods in a retrospective analysis {{of the financial crisis}} of 2008, and found that only F-Score produced positive results.|$|E
