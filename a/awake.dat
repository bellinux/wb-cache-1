50|$|On {{the way to}} the rally, the Quincy Wide <b>Awakes</b> {{passed through}} Payson, the {{residents}} of which had erected a pole with an offensive effigy of Lincoln astride a rail. The Wide <b>Awakes,</b> however, carried a banner with an equally offensive depiction of a drunken Douglas falling over a pile of rails.

Jenna and Tracy are plagued by erotic dreams involving Kenneth, and to stop having them, they decide to stay <b>awake.</b> This fails, so they decide {{to deal with it}} à la A Nightmare on Elm Street, by killing Kenneth in their dreams. They wake up (believing they are still dreaming) and attack Kenneth. Witnessing this, Pete tells them they are wide <b>awake,</b> and that it is morning, which prompts Jenna and Tracy to realize that they slept through the night without having any dreams of Kenneth. They apologize to Kenneth for attacking him, and he accepts their apology.|$|E

5|$|Nancy decides {{the only}} way to end this is to pull Krueger out of their dreams and kill him in reality. Quentin tries to stay <b>awake</b> long enough to pull Nancy out of her dream when she has Krueger, but he falls asleep and is attacked. Krueger goes after Nancy, and {{explains}} that he intentionally left her for last so she would stay <b>awake</b> long enough that, when she finally fell asleep, she would {{no longer be able to}} wake up.

60|$|Anyhow, I was famished when we <b>awoke.</b> I {{think that}} it was the pangs of hunger that <b>awoke</b> me. Ptarmigan and wild boar fell before my {{revolver}} within a dozen moments of my awakening. Perry soon had a roaring fire blazing by the brink of the little stream.|$|R
6000|$|By {{these words}} more is implied than expressed; for this <b>awaking</b> of Noah, not only informeth us of natural <b>awaking</b> from sleep, but of his spiritual <b>awaking</b> from his sin. He <b>awoke</b> from his wine. As [...] "Ely said to Hannah, How long wilt thou be drunken? Put away thy wine from thee" [...] (1 Sam 1:14). By which words he exhorteth to repentance. It is said of Nabal, That his wine went from him, as many men's sins forsake them, {{because they are}} decayed, and want {{strength}} and opportunity to perform them. Now this may be done, where the heart remaineth yet unsanctified: but Noah <b>awoke</b> from his wine, put it away, or, repented him of the evil of his doing. [...] "A just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief" [...] (Pro 24:16). Wherefore they have cause to say to all the Hams in the world, [...] "Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise" [...] (Micah 7:8); but your fall, is a fall into mischief.|$|R

5|$|A chavrusa {{helps the}} student stay <b>awake,</b> keep his mind {{focused on the}} learning, sharpen his {{reasoning}} powers, develop his thoughts into words, and organize his thoughts into logical arguments. This type of learning also imparts precision and clarity into ideas that would otherwise remain vague. Having to listen to, analyze and respond to another's opinion inculcates respect for others. It is considered poor manners to interrupt one's chavrusa. The chavrusa relationship also strengthens the student's personal commitment to his studies, as he is loathe to disappoint or cancel on his chavrusa.|$|E
5|$|A {{sneak peek}} was {{released}} online {{shortly before the}} episode's original broadcast.
