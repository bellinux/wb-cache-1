Ontario cabinet minister David Caplan described Baird <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> waterfront renewal and Miller described him as an ally of the city. Baird spent Christmas 2006 meeting with Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Brodie {{believed}} that previous historians had unduly vilified Stevens, and she enjoyed {{the prospect of}} rebuilding a reputation rather than, as in her Joseph Smith biography, tearing one down. Stevens <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> black people was a timely interest as the Civil Rights Movement increased in intensity. Research materials were available at Yale University, where Bernard Brodie was employed. Fawn Brodie wondered how Stevens had been affected psychologically by his physical deformity, a club foot.|$|E

His supporters have lauded him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> indigenous rights, anti-imperialism, and environmentalism. Alternately, a number of leftist, indigenous, and environmentalist critics have accused him of failing {{to live up to}} many of his espoused values, while right-wing opponents have accused him of being excessively radical and authoritarian and claimed that his defence of coca contributes to illegal cocaine production.|$|E
5|$|The longest-serving non-royal head {{of state}} in the 20th and 21st centuries, Castro {{polarized}} world opinion. His supporters view him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> socialism and anti-imperialism whose revolutionary regime advanced economic and social justice while securing Cuba's independence from American imperialism. Critics view him as a dictator whose administration oversaw human-rights abuses, the exodus {{of a large number}} of Cubans and the impoverishment of the country's economy. Castro was decorated with various international awards and significantly influenced various individuals and groups across the world.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{then and}} now have been divided over Wilfrid. His {{followers}} commissioned Stephen of Ripon to write a Vita Sancti Wilfrithi (or Life of Wilfrid) shortly after his death, and the medieval historian Bede also wrote extensively about him. Wilfrid lived ostentatiously, and travelled with a large retinue. He ruled {{a large number of}} monasteries, and claimed to be the first Englishman to introduce the Rule of Saint Benedict into English monasteries. Some modern historians see him mainly <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> Roman customs against the customs of the British and Irish churches, others as an advocate for monasticism.|$|E

5|$|In the pre-war years, Göring enjoyed {{widespread}} personal {{popularity among}} the German public {{because of his}} perceived sociability, colour and humour. As the Nazi leader most responsible for economic matters, he presented himself <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> national interests over allegedly corrupt big business and the old German elite. The Nazi press was on Göring's side. Other Nazi leaders, such as Hess and Ribbentrop, were envious of his popularity. Even in the political circles of Britain and the United States, {{there were those who}} viewed Göring as more acceptable than the other Nazis, and as a possible mediator between the western democracies and Hitler.|$|E
5|$|Leader of the Opposition and Labour leader Ed Miliband, {{who knew}} Benn {{personally}} {{as a family}} friend, said:I think Tony Benn will be remembered <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> the powerless, as a conviction politician, as somebody of deep principle and integrity. The thing about Tony Benn is that you always knew what he stood for, and who he stood up for. And I think that's why he was admired right across the political spectrum. There are people who agreed with him and disagreed with him, including in my own party, but I think people admired that sense of conviction and integrity that shone through from Tony Benn.|$|E
5|$|Widely {{considered}} one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century, Lenin was the posthumous subject of a pervasive personality cult within the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991. He became an ideological figurehead behind Marxism–Leninism and thus a prominent influence over the international communist movement. A controversial and highly divisive individual, Lenin is viewed by supporters <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> socialism and the working class, while critics on both the left and right emphasize his role as founder and leader of an authoritarian regime responsible for political repression and mass killings.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1860s, {{a more liberal}} {{political}} climate in Bohemia encouraged Smetana to return permanently to Prague. He threw himself into the musical life of the city, primarily <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> the new genre of Czech opera. In 1866 his first two operas, The Brandenburgers in Bohemia and The Bartered Bride, were premiered at Prague's new Provisional Theatre, the latter achieving great popularity. In that same year, Smetana became the theatre's principal conductor, but the years of his conductorship were marked by controversy. Factions within the city's musical establishment considered his identification with the progressive ideas of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner inimical {{to the development of}} a distinctively Czech opera style. This opposition interfered with his creative work, and might have hastened a decline in health that precipitated his resignation from the theatre in 1874.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the visit, the US {{government}} and the AFV made thorough preparations to make Diệm's visit pleasant, and the AFV successfully lobbied the media to write favourable reports on the South Vietnamese leader. Diệm was trumpeted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> democracy, and mentions of his autocratic style and election rigging were avoided. Diệm arrived by plane in Washington, D.C. on May 8, and was personally greeted at the airport by President Dwight D. Eisenhower—an honor Eisenhower accorded to only one other visiting head of state. Diệm's motorcade was greeted by 50,000 wellwishers and his address to the US Congress and his policies were heartily endorsed by both sides of politics. During {{his time in the}} US capital, Diệm also attended receptions, and had private meetings with both Eisenhower and the US Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, to discuss American support for South Vietnam, although the meeting with Dulles was ineffectual as Diệm spoke continuously, rendering two-way discussions impossible.|$|E
5|$|Some {{interest}} in Forster's life and revolutionary actions was revived {{in the context}} of the liberal sentiments leading up to the 1848 revolution. But he was largely forgotten in the Germany of Wilhelm II and more so in the Third Reich, where {{interest in}} Forster was limited to his stance on Poland from his private letters. Interest in Forster resumed in the 1960s in East Germany, where he was interpreted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> class struggle. The GDR research station in Antarctica that was opened on October 25, 1987, was named after him. In West Germany, the search for democratic traditions in German history also lead to a more diversified picture of him in the 1970s. The Alexander von Humboldt foundation named a scholarship program for foreign scholars from developing countries after him. His reputation as one of the first and most outstanding German ethnologists is indisputable, and his works are seen as crucial in the development of ethnology in Germany into a separate branch of science.|$|E

5|$|Harith {{advocated}} various reforms, {{the most}} prominent being the full legal equality of the native non-Arab converts (mawali) with the Arab Muslims, echoing a long-standing demand of the former, in conformity with the precepts of Islam. This had been attempted twice before, by the Caliph Umar II (r. 717–720) and by the governors Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri and Ashras ibn Abdallah al-Sulami, but both times the resulting rise in conversions and concomitant drop in revenue (as the numerous mawali {{would not have to}} pay the poll tax) put an end to this, leading to a first rebellion in 728 under Abu al-Sayda' Salih ibn Tarif. Many of the groups and individuals associated with this first uprising would also participate in Harith's movement. Harith was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> the rights of the ʿajam (non-Arabs, especially Iranians), many of whom flocked to his banner, but he also had a large following from the disaffected among the Arabs themselves, especially his fellow Tamim and the Azd. Disaffection was widespread among the Khurasani Arabs due to the heavy casualties suffered against the Turgesh at the Battle of the Defile in 731, as well as the dissemination of anti-Umayyad propaganda by proto-Shi'ite groups. This was exacerbated by the resentment felt at the introduction of 20,000 Iraqi troops into the province {{in the aftermath of the}} Defile, and the parallel order of Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 723–743) to disperse the older Arab settlers from Marw to other settlements so as to improve their defence against the Turgesh.|$|E
