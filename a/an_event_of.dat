5|$|The Natchez revolt figured as <b>an</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> monumental {{significance}} in French historiography and {{literature of the}} 18th and 19th centuries.

The 1975 tournament started on 7 June. The first three events were held in England and officially known as the Prudential Cup after the sponsors Prudential plc. The matches consisted of 60 six-ball overs per team, played during the daytime in traditional form, with the players wearing cricket whites and using red cricket balls.|$|E
5|$|The second Persian {{invasion}} of Greece was <b>an</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> major significance in European history. A {{large number of}} historians hold that, had Greece been conquered, the Ancient Greek culture {{that lies at the}} basis of Western civilization would have never developed (and by extension Western civilization itself). While this may be an exaggeration, it is clear that even at the time the Greeks understood that something very significant had happened.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> grave {{embarrassment to}} the Soviet Union came in October 1981 when one of its {{submarines}} ran aground near the Swedish naval base at Karlskrona. As this was a militarily sensitive location, Sweden took an aggressive stance on the incident, detaining the Whiskey-class sub for two weeks as they awaited an official explanation from Moscow. Eventually it was released, but Stockholm refused to accept Soviet claims that this was merely an accident, especially since numerous unidentified submarines had been spotted near the Swedish coast. Sweden also announced that radiation had been detected emanating from the submarine and they believed it to be carrying nuclear missiles. Moscow would neither confirm nor deny this and instead merely accused the Swedes of espionage.|$|E

5|$|At the 1967 Interzonal, held at Sousse, Tunisia, Fischer scored 8½ {{points in}} the first 10 games, to lead the field. His {{observance}} of the Worldwide Church of God's seventh-day Sabbath was honored by the organizers, but deprived Fischer of several rest days, which led to a scheduling dispute, causing Fischer to forfeit two games in protest and later withdraw, eliminating himself from the 1969 World Championship cycle. Communications difficulties with the highly inexperienced local organizers were also a significant factor, since Fischer knew little French and the organizers had very limited English. No one in Tunisian chess had previous experience running <b>an</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> this stature.|$|E
5|$|Ginou Etienne, who was 23 {{years old}} at the time of her {{participation}} in the Beijing Olympics, participated in the women's 400meters event. She was the only Haitian participating in the event. Etienne had not previously appeared at any Olympic games. Etienne participated in the August 16 qualification round, where she was placed in the third heat. Etienne completed the event in 53.94seconds, placing sixth in <b>an</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> seven participants. She defeated Rachidatou Seini Maikido of Niger (1:03.19) but fell behind the fifth-place finalist, Puerto Rico's Carol Rodriguez (53.08seconds). The leaders of Etienne's heat were Russia's Anastasia Kapachinskaya (51.32seconds) and the United States' Mary Wineberg (51.46seconds). Out of the 50 athletes who participated in the qualification round, Etienne placed 41st. She did not advance to later rounds.|$|E
5|$|Murasaki {{began her}} diary after she entered service at Shōshi's court. Much {{of what we}} know about her and her {{experiences}} at court comes from the diary, which covers the period from about 1008 to 1010. The long descriptive passages, some of which may have originated as letters, cover her relationships with the other ladies-in-waiting, Michinaga's temperament, the birth of Shōshi's sons—at Michinaga's mansion rather than at the Imperial Palace—and the process of writing Genji, including descriptions of passing newly written chapters to calligraphers for transcriptions. Typical of contemporary court diaries written to honor patrons, Murasaki devotes half to the birth of Shōshi's son Emperor Go-Ichijō, <b>an</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> enormous importance to Michinaga: he had planned for it with his daughter's marriage which made him grandfather and de facto regent to an emperor.|$|E

5|$|Ravel {{composed}} little during 1913. He {{collaborated with}} Stravinsky on a performing version of Mussorgsky's unfinished opera Khovanshchina, {{and his own}} works were the Trois poèmes de Mallarmé for soprano and chamber ensemble, and two short piano pieces, À la manière de Borodine and À la manière de Chabrier. In 1913, together with Debussy, Ravel was among the musicians present at the dress rehearsal of The Rite of Spring. Stravinsky later said that Ravel {{was the only person}} who immediately understood the music. Ravel predicted that the premiere of the Rite would be seen as <b>an</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> historic importance equal to that of Pelléas et Mélisande.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} offered Jovanović {{the opportunity}} {{to make a name for}} himself as a serious history painter, given that the subject of the work was <b>an</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> international significance and the painting was to be displayed in a foreign capital. To ensure Migration of the Serbs was historically accurate, Jovanović studied authentic medieval weapons, costumes and other objects, later incorporating them into the composition. He also studied medieval histories, collected ethnographical evidence and consulted historians. Notably, the Church asked the historian and Orthodox priest Ilarion Ruvarac to consult Jovanović on the historical details of the migration and accompany him on a visit to the monasteries of Fruška Gora, where the young artist examined a number of contemporary sources and objects from the time.|$|E
5|$|The first {{community}} hall at Meander {{was built}} in 1914. It was built by local resident Fred Bowman, who maintained it until 1945 when responsibility {{was taken over by}} a local committee. Locals decided, in 1952, to build a new hall. Funding from the hall came from, competitions, dances and the growing of peas for sale. The hall opened 3 December 1954 and was physically joined to the original c.1957. The Road from Deloraine to Meander was sealed in 1964, <b>an</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> some note that was celebrated with a gymkhana and fair. Mains electricity reached Meander in 1952 when power, supplied by the Hydro-Electric Commission, was switched on in Meander's township area December 1952. Meander's street lights were first turned on 12 November 1971.|$|E

5|$|This {{painting}} is considered among Matejko's most famous works {{and is also}} one of his largest canvases. It portrays <b>an</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> significant political triumph for Poland, the Prussian Homage, in which Poland was able to enforce its will over Prussia. Prussia latter gained independence and turned against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, becoming one of the nations that divided Poland among them. Matejko's painting was created during the partition period, when independent Poland had ceased to exist, and like many of Matejko's other works, it aimed to remind the Polish people of their most famous historical triumphs.|$|E
5|$|Eager {{to augment}} {{his power and}} angered by Roosevelt's and Barkley's refusal to accept his {{suggestion}} of appointing Logan to the Supreme Court, Chandler did not attend a long-planned dinner in Barkley's honor on January 22, 1938; instead, he held <b>an</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> his own at Louisville's exclusive Pendennis Club at which he alluded to his intentions of challenging Barkley during the upcoming Democratic senatorial primary. Barkley officially announced his re-election bid the following day. The death of another federal judge on January 26 provided a second opportunity for Roosevelt to appoint Senator Logan to a judgeship and appease Chandler, but Logan refused to consider the appointment. Following a January 31 meeting in Washington, D.C. between Roosevelt and Chandler, during which Roosevelt urged Chandler to put his senatorial ambitions on hold, Chandler was encouraged by his political mentor, Virginia's Harry F. Byrd to challenge Barkley. Chandler heeded Byrd's advice, making an official announcement of his candidacy on February 23, 1938, in Newport, Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Remarkably, though {{hundreds}} {{of homes and}} other structures were leveled, no one was killed by tornadoes that day. Tornado damage caused about 140 injuries, mostly minor, and one death and 11 injuries were caused by wind damage. In just five hours, the storms produced more than 12,500 lightning strikes. The airport in Oxford, Connecticut recorded 4.4inches (112mm) of rain in just 30 minutes. While the northeastern United States experiences occasional tornadoes, <b>an</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> this scale is especially rare. Typical tornadoes {{in this area are}} short-lived and not particularly damaging. This outbreak featured several long-lived tornadoes, produced by storms which also produced destructive non-tornadic winds over a large area. Since 1950, only six violent tornadoes have occurred in the Northeastern US, two of which were part of this outbreak. It was by far the worst tornado event in the area since May 2, 1983, when six significant tornadoes tore through New York, and maybe the worst since the Worcester Tornado.|$|E

5|$|The sky bears overt metaphorical {{significance}} {{and is the}} centrepiece of the painting's symbolism. Alexander, identified by the Egyptians and others as a god of the sun, finds his victory in the sun's rays; and the Persians are routed into the darkness beneath the crescent moon, {{a symbol of the}} Near East. Considered in terms of the painting's contemporary context, the sun's triumph over the moon represents Christendom's victory over the Islamism of the Ottomans. Eschatological meaning, probably inspired by prophecies in the Book of Daniel, is imbued in the heavenly setting. In particular, Daniel 7 predicts {{the rise and fall of}} four kingdoms before the Second Coming; these were thought to be Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome at the time of the painting's creation. Altdorfer saw the Battle of Issus as a principal indicator of the transition of power from Persia to Greece, and thus as <b>an</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> cosmic significance. The battle also marked a progression toward the end of the world – an important theological concern in the 16th century, given that the last traces of Rome were diminishing with the papacy. As a member of the Regensburg council and a practising Catholic, Altdorfer frequently interacted with the Church and was surely aware of this trend of eschatological thought. Schedel, too, had calculated that the final age of the seven he identified was nigh. It may therefore be inferred that the sky's expression of the momentous event at Issus was intended to be of contemporary relevance as well.|$|E
