5|$|Duke {{regards the}} rivalry as far less {{significant}} than the Carolina–Duke rivalry. The Duke–Michigan rivalry {{is fueled by}} the fact that both institutions strive to be premier academic institutions with solid reputations for producing scholars and student athletes rather than just athletic powerhouses. Duke <b>and</b> <b>Michigan</b> have played one another in men's basketball 30 times. The teams have played twice in the same season three times: 1963–64, 1991–92, and 2008–09. Michigan has played Duke more times than they have any other school outside of the state of Michigan that has never {{been a member of the}} Big Ten Conference. In turn, Duke's 30 games against Michigan are the most they have played any other school outside of the Maryland-Virginia-North Carolina-South Carolina region that has never been a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Eight of the meetings between Duke <b>and</b> <b>Michigan</b> have featured opponents both ranked in the top ten in the AP Poll; six times both teams were ranked in the top five. Michigan has not faced any of its fellow conference members as many times with both participants so highly ranked.|$|E

Alan Williams, Ionia County engineer, helped to design the diamond marker used to sign the highways; he is also known for placing a picnic table alongside US16 (Grand River Avenue) in 1929 south of Saranac, considered the first in the country. Other sources say that the first roadside park in the country was created by Herbert Larson near what is now US2 near Iron River in 1919–20. The first crows nest traffic tower in the US was installed at the intersection of Woodward <b>and</b> <b>Michigan</b> avenues in Detroit on October 9, 1917. The tower elevated a police officer above the center of the intersection to direct traffic before it was replaced in October 1920 with the world's first four-way traffic light.|$|E

5|$|On December 7, 1959, the I-94/US12 freeway {{opened on}} the south side of Kalamazoo. When US12 was shifted to follow the new freeway, the former route through {{downtown}} Kalamazoo was redesignated Business US Highway12 (Bus. US12). The next year, it was renumbered BL I-94. In 1963, the US131 freeway {{opened on the}} west side of Kalamazoo. Along with the creation of Bus. US131 along a portion of the BL I-94 routing, BL I-94 was rerouted along the US131 freeway on the west end back to I-94. The section of Stadium Drive west of US131 and the 9th Street routing was removed from BL I-94. Kalamazoo and the newly built Michikal avenues were transferred to state jurisdiction in 1965. Since then, Kalamazoo <b>and</b> <b>Michigan</b> avenues have been used as a pair of one-way streets downtown. Kalamazoo and Michikal were then signed as westbound BL I-94 from Stadium Drive to Michigan Avenue while Main Street <b>and</b> <b>Michigan</b> Avenue continued to serve eastbound traffic.|$|E
