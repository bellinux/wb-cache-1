40|$|The {{industrialization}} of CFRP production {{demands for}} new planning and engineering tools {{in order to}} develop more efficient production processes and higher <b>automated</b> <b>production</b> systems. This thesis presents a new concept for digital <b>production</b> <b>engineering</b> in the context of digital factory, which is focused on the integrated planning and simulation of complex production scenarios. As approach of model-driven engineering, a domain-specifc modeling language and a factory data model are developed in order to generate models of material flow simulation. Thereby, major challenges of digital CFRP <b>production</b> <b>engineering</b> are different technology readiness levels, complex routings of tools and materials as well as the consideration of rework and autoclave processes. These challenges motivated the development of an eight level modeling concept called GRAMOSA, which integrates the management of alternative production scenarios and focusses on an integrated production and logistics planning...|$|R

AMT are broadly defined by many authors (small and chen, Sheppard and stock) as “ an <b>automated</b> <b>production</b> system of people, machines and tools for the planning and control of the production process, including the procurement of raw materials, parts and components and the shipment and service of finished products ” In particular, AMT is defined as any new manufacturing technique, the adoption of which is likely to lead to changes in a firm’s manufacturing practice, management systems and approaches to design and <b>production</b> <b>engineering</b> of the product.

40|$|Abstract Coping with {{evolution}} in <b>automated</b> <b>production</b> systems implies a cross-disciplinary challenge along the system's life-cycle for variant-rich systems of high complexity. The authors from computer science and automation provide an interdisciplinary survey on challenges and {{state of the}} art in evolution of <b>automated</b> <b>production</b> systems. Selected challenges are illustrated on the case of a simple pick and place unit. In {{the first part of the}} paper, we discuss the development process of <b>automated</b> <b>production</b> systems as well as the different type of evolutions during the system's life-cycle on the case of a pick and place unit. In the second part, we survey the challenges associated with {{evolution in}} the different development phases and a couple of cross-cutting areas and review existing approaches addressing the challenges. We close with summarizing future research directions to address the challenges of evolution in <b>automated</b> <b>production</b> systems...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{conduct the}} {{research}} at {{all stages of}} design, development, operation, residual operation life determination, namely, preliminary study, action principle choice, design of draft and technical projects, their optimization, preparation of design documentation and control information for <b>automated</b> <b>production,</b> comprehensive <b>engineering</b> analysis, it is required to use the latest computer technologies. Their use can not only present data and information in some way, but also gives the opportunity to effectively and directly interact with the information object that is created or demonstrated. Methodology. To perform engineering calculations associated with {{the analysis of the}} strength of machines, mechanisms, constructions one uses both analytical and numerical methods in practice. The most common method for analysing the stress-strain state of object models, obtaining their dynamic and stability characteristics at constant and variable modes of external load is the finite element method, which is implemented in many famous and widespread software products, providing strength calculation of models of machines, mechanisms and structures. Findings. The use of modern software for designing machine parts and various types of their joints and for strength analysis of structures is justified. Colour charts for distribution of stresses, displacement, internal efforts, safety factor and others allow accurate and quick identification of the most dangerous places in the structure. The program also provides an opportunity to «look» inside the elements and see the resulting distribution of internal force factors. Originality. The paper considered the aspects, which are unexplored at present, associated with the current state and prospects of development of industrial production, the use of software package for design and calculations in the mechanical industry. The result of the work is the justification of software application for solving problems that are aimed at using research findings for various practical tasks in specific fields of mechanical engineering. Practical value. Compared with other software systems, popularity of the considered one is explained by easy mastering of the system, quick implementation both in training and in production process The organizational structure, «friendly» graphical interface and accessible language make learning and use of the program very convenient. These and other factors actually reduce the time for project implementation, emphasize the relevance and the practical importance of the software system, which is appreciated by its users...|$|R
