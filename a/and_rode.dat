40|$|As a {{multimodal}} travel behavior, park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> includes several trip modes such as car, walking, bus, or railway.

This paper, based on the park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> behavior survey in Beijing, will analyze {{the relationship between the}} perception of the influencing factors and the behavior intent for park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> by using structural equation modeling. The conclusions suggest that the park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> choice for travelers is a passive behavior which means giving up driving the car is mainly caused by the serious traffic congestion. Furthermore, improving the service level of the park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> facilities <b>and</b> the comfort for riding bus or railway will increase the utilization of park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> facilities. The perceptions of the influencing factors have both direct and indirect effects on the travel intent for park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> by the interaction among the influencing factors...|$|R
50|$|Park <b>and</b> <b>Ride</b> (Commuter)METRO {{provides}} a well known Park <b>and</b> <b>Ride</b> service that serves riders who work downtown, Greenway Plaza, Uptown and The Texas Medical Center {{and live in}} outlying residential neighborhoods {{in the city of}} Houston, as well as several suburbs, where Park <b>and</b> <b>Ride</b> lots are located. A Park <b>and</b> <b>Ride</b> lot functions much like a transit center, and some Park <b>and</b> <b>Ride</b> lots are served by regular local routes in addition to the dedicated Park <b>and</b> <b>Ride</b> routes. During rush hour, each Park <b>and</b> <b>Ride</b> lot has its own route to reduce overcrowding, leading to multiple routes serving the same freeway. In the Midday, this type of service is combined to a single route serving multiple park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> lots <b>and</b> designated with a 9 {{at the end of the}} route number (example: 219, 259, 229).

There, Beverly worked a secretary, initially with Robert Oppenheimer and his secretary Priscilla Green. She then became secretary to Robert Bacher, the head of Physics (P) Division, and later the Gadget (G) Division, {{for the rest of}} the war.

5|$|At the 1933 World Scout Jamboree, a 14-year-old Scout named Bela Bánáthy was {{kneeling}} by his campfire when three uniformed men rode up on horseback: Count Paul Teleki, the Chief Scout of Hungary and the Chief of Staff for the jamboree; General Kisbarnaki Ferenc Farkas, a general staff {{officer of the}} Royal Hungarian Army; and Baden-Powell, the British hero of the Boer War and Chief Scout of the World. The men introduced themselves to the Scout and inspected his camp. They complimented him on {{a job well done}} <b>and</b> <b>rode</b> on.

Riding Whizashiningwalla BB, she was eliminated in the qualifying rounds. At the Games, she also performed a reining demonstration at the presentation of the team dressage medal and participated in an exhibition of freestyle reining.

The selection of the sub districts that may travel to the park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> locations is considered to be another important aspect. The result shows that the travel time and travel cost of air travelers who stopped by at park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> tend to be higher than direct travel from home to airport...|$|R

40|$|The {{detailed}} and {{long-term effects of}} park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> are more complex than generally acknowledged. In 1994, studies of park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> were carried out in Oxford and York.

However, some users had switched from modes other than car and others {{were found to be}} making additional trips which had been attracted by the opportunity to park <b>and</b> <b>ride.</b> Congestion has remained persistent in the cities studied and there is concern that total travel may have been increased rather than reduced, which was the intention.

5|$|Nevertheless, Bryennios's victory seemed certain, for {{his wings}} began to envelop Alexios's Franks in the centre.

With only six of his men around him, he then managed to break through the surrounding enemy soldiers. Confusion reigned behind their lines {{as a result of the}} Pecheneg attack on the rebel camp, and in this tumult Alexios saw Bryennios's imperial parade horse, with his two swords of state, being driven away to safety.
