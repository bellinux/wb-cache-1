5|$|A Miranda warning is an {{explanation}} of a suspect's rights that must be given by law enforcement before interrogation. It stems from the 1966 Miranda v. Arizona case, and is based primarily on the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. If <b>a</b> <b>defendant</b> in custody is not notified of their rights via a Miranda warning, any confession they give may not be admissible in court. If <b>a</b> <b>defendant</b> is not in police custody, however, police are free to question suspects without informing them of their rights, and their statements may still be admissible.|$|E

5|$|Whether counsel are {{appointed}} or retained, the Clause protects {{the role of}} counsel and certain attributes of the attorney-client relationship. For example, the Clause requires that the defendant be given time to consult with counsel and that counsel be given time to investigate the case pre-trial. And, the Clause also prohibits a state from barring <b>a</b> <b>defendant</b> from being cross-examined by counsel, or restricting {{the order in which}} the defendant may be called as a witness. Further, the court may not prevent <b>a</b> <b>defendant</b> from consulting with her counsel during an overnight recess, even if the recess bisects direct- and cross-examination of the defendant. Similarly, the defendant has a right to have her counsel make a closing argument, even if a bench trial.|$|E

40|$|Incarceration {{results in}} {{negative}} social, psychological, and economic impacts on an inmate’s family and dependents. These impacts last {{well beyond the}} period of incarceration and can cause lifelong challenges. Federal statutes require courts to consider mitigating factors while calculating a sentence, including <b>a</b> <b>defendant’s</b> characteristics. Family ties and responsibilities are considered an aspect of <b>a</b> <b>defendant’s</b> characteristics. Yet the Federal Sentencing Guidelines significantly limit {{the extent to which}} courts can use family ties and responsibilities to reduce or alter <b>a</b> <b>defendant’s</b> sentence. This Note first argues that the Guidelines should be amended to indicate that courts can consider family ties and responsibilities when determining a sentence. This Note then argues that Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure should be amended to require that a family impact assessment be incorporated into each presentence investigation report to provide courts with information about <b>a</b> <b>defendant’s</b> family ties and responsibilities...|$|R

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>defendant</b> must {{be given}} an {{opportunity}} to retain counsel, even if not entitled to appointed counsel. Subject to considerations such as conflicts of interest, scheduling, counsel's authorization to practice law in the jurisdiction, and counsel's willingness to represent the defendant (whether pro bono or for a fee), criminal defendants {{have a right to be}} represented by counsel of their choice. The remedy for erroneous depravation of first choice counsel is automatic reversal.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>defendant</b> who is {{competent}} {{to stand trial}} is therefore also {{competent to}} plead guilty, waiving the full panoply of trial rights, but not necessarily competent enough to represent herself at trial {{in the face of}} a state procedural rule requiring a higher standard of competence for pro se representation.|$|E
5|$|An assault is {{not caused}} if <b>a</b> <b>defendant</b> threatens {{to shoot the}} victim, but the victim is aware that the gun is not loaded or fake. However, {{it would be the}} actus reus of an assault if the victim wrongly {{believes}} the gun is, or may be, loaded. Since assault is a summary offence, no prosecutions take place for attempted assault. However, it is possible to commit attempts of aggravated forms of assault.|$|E

(Such reports are often filed under seal because they include financial information about <b>a</b> <b>defendant</b> and sometimes unreleased details {{relating to the}} investigation).

5|$|While <b>a</b> <b>defendant</b> is {{entitled}} to a fair cross section in the venire, the defendant is not guaranteed a fair cross section in the actual grand jury or petit jury. Yet, the equal protection clause does regulate the use of peremptory challenges {{in the selection of}} the petit jury from the venire. In the landmark case of Batson v. Kentucky (1986), the Supreme Court reversed a criminal conviction because of the prosecutor's racially motivated use of peremptory challenges.|$|E

In Alleyne v.

Cardozo's conception, that tort liability only occurs when <b>a</b> <b>defendant</b> breaches a duty of care the defendant owes to a plaintiff, causing the injury sued for, has been widely accepted in American law. In dealing with proximate cause, many states have taken the approach championed by the Court of Appeals' dissenter in Palsgraf, Judge William S. Andrews. Some legal scholars in recent years have criticized Cardozo for not taking into account Palsgraf's impoverished circumstances.|$|E
5|$|If <b>a</b> <b>defendant</b> is convicted, {{the usual}} remedy for a {{violation}} {{of one of these}} provisions is reversal of the conviction or modification of the defendant's sentence. With the exception of structural errors (such as the total denial of counsel), constitutional errors are subject to harmless error analysis, although they must be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. With the exception of a Double Jeopardy or Speedy Trial violation, the government will usually be permitted to retry the defendant. Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), these provisions are the source of nearly all reviewable errors in federal habeas review of state convictions.|$|E

5|$|Section 1(2) of the Act {{creates an}} offence which {{includes}} {{all the elements}} of the section 1(1) offence with an additional element of intending or being reckless as to the endangering of life. The offence lies in possible effects of the defendant's actions and it is not therefore necessary to prove an actual danger to life. However, there must be a connection between the damage and the mental state of the defendant. In R v. Steer (1986), the defendant fired a gun intending to injure another person, but missed and hit a window instead; it was held that although the intention to endanger life and the fact of damage coexisted, the damage itself did not endanger life. This approach was extended in R v. Webster (1995), in which the relationship between the damage caused and the damage intended was explored. That case involved the throwing of heavy items into the paths of moving vehicles, and it was held that <b>a</b> <b>defendant</b> may be guilty if he intends to endanger life by the actual damage intended, or is reckless that life will be endangered by that damage. Therefore, although <b>a</b> <b>defendant</b> does not necessarily intend to endanger life when he intends to break a car window, ignoring the likely risk that this will cause the driver to swerve into the path of another vehicle, perhaps fatally, constitutes recklessness and is a sufficient causative nexus.|$|E

5|$|Slade's Case (or Slade v. Morley) {{was a case}} in English {{contract}} law that ran from 1596 to 1602. Under the medieval common law, claims seeking the repayment of a debt or other matters could only be pursued through a writ of debt in the Court of Common Pleas, a problematic and archaic process. By 1558 the lawyers had succeeded in creating another method, enforced by the Court of King's Bench, through the action of assumpsit, which was technically for deceit. The legal fiction used was that by failing to pay after promising to do so, <b>a</b> <b>defendant</b> had committed deceit, and was liable to the plaintiff. The conservative Common Pleas, through the appellate court the Court of Exchequer Chamber, began to overrule decisions made by the King's Bench on assumpsit, causing friction between the courts.|$|E
5|$|Tarla Makaeff, {{who paid}} nearly $60,000 to Trump University in 2008, brought {{a class action}} lawsuit against Trump University on April 30, 2010, in U.S. District Court for Southern California. The suit, Makaeff v. Trump University, LLC, sought refunds for Makaeff and other former clients of Trump University, as well as punitive damages for breach of contract, fraud, negligent {{misrepresentation}} and bad faith. It did not originally name Donald Trump as <b>a</b> <b>defendant,</b> but did so in a later amended complaint. In February 2014, U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel denied recognition to the nationwide class the plaintiffs had requested and recognized the suit as class-action {{on the part of}} Trump University clients in three states – California, Florida, and New York – based on specific alleged violations of the consumer protection laws of those states.
