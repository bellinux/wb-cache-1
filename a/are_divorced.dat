5|$|Unusual weather phenomena, such as {{snow and}} mist, fascinated Monet because they altered the {{chromatic}} appearance of familiar topography. In such paintings as The Magpie, one of Monet's early masterpieces, form dissolves under {{the combination of}} a greatly restricted color range, aerial perspective, and broken brushwork. A virtuoso color performance, the painting is an essay on the variations of white perceptible in the reflection of sun on crisp new snow. Wonderfully abstract passages of flat color, such as the strong violet shades along the fence, <b>are</b> <b>divorced</b> from the spatial realities of the objects portrayed.|$|E

50|$|It was, indeed, {{a way of}} life, which recognizes liberty, {{equality}} and fraternity as the principles of life and which cannot <b>be</b> <b>divorced</b> from each other: Liberty cannot <b>be</b> <b>divorced</b> from equality; equality cannot <b>be</b> <b>divorced</b> from liberty. Nor can liberty and equality <b>be</b> <b>divorced</b> from fraternity. Without equality, liberty would produce the supremacy of the few over the many. Equality without liberty would kill individual initiative. Without fraternity, liberty and equality could not become a natural course of things.|$|R

The western continent is home to the technologically-advanced empire of Niflheim and the nation of Tenebrae, which is ruled by the Oracle—a priestess with the ability to commune with the world's deities and halt the Starscourge, a plague that absorbs all natural light and allows nocturnal monsters known as Daemons to roam the world.

25|$|Joan Harris (née Holloway) (Christina Hendricks): Office {{manager and}} head of the {{secretarial}} pool at Sterling Cooper. She had a long-term affair with Roger Sterling until his two heart attacks (Season 1) cause him to end the relationship. In Season 2, she becomes engaged to Dr. Greg Harris (Samuel Page). By Season 3, they are married and at Greg's request Joan quits her job at Sterling Cooper. Their marriage is tested when Greg's lack of skill as a surgeon and consequent difficulties securing work force Joan to return to work at a department store, prompting her to call Roger Sterling to ask for his help in finding an office job. Because of her invaluable organizational and managerial skills, she is later hired for the new agency formed by Don, Roger, Bert, and Lane. Meanwhile, Greg's desire to further his career as a surgeon leads him to obtain a commission in the Army, and early in Season 4 he is sent to basic training and then to Vietnam. While her husband is deployed, Joan and Roger have one sexual encounter, which results in her becoming pregnant. Joan initially decides to terminate the pregnancy, but changes her mind and gives birth shortly before the beginning of Season 5, with her husband unaware he is not the father. Greg returns from Vietnam during Season 5, but he and Joan separate, after he announces to Joan that he is returning to Vietnam for another tour of duty regardless of her feelings on the matter, and <b>are</b> <b>divorced</b> {{by the end of the}} season. By the close of Season 5, Joan has become a full partner at SCDP in exchange for agreeing to sleep with a Jaguar executive to help land the account.

Joan is furious over the loss of potential earnings and the fact that her sacrifice has been for nothing. At the close of the series, she is subject to harassment by McCann executives and agrees to a buyout of her partnership stake. She starts a production company called Holloway Harris.|$|E
