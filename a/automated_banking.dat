40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} evolvable computational systems {{built as}} hierarchies of evolvable components, where an evolvable component is an encapsulation of a supervisory component and its supervisee. Here, we extend our prior {{work on a}} revision-based logical modelling framework for such systems to incorporate programs within each component. We describe mechanisms for combining programs, possibly in different languages, from separate components and outline an operational semantics for programmed evolvable systems. We show how supervisory components extend run-time verifiers/monitors with capabilities for diagnosis and change. We illustrate the logical modelling using {{an example of an}} <b>automated</b> <b>bank</b> teller machine. ...|$|R

5000|$|In Canada, {{the debit}} card is {{sometimes}} referred to as a [...] "bank card". It is a client card issued by a bank that provides access to funds and other bank account transactions, such as transferring funds, checking balances, paying bills, etc., as well as point of purchase transactions connected on the Interac network. Since its national launch in 1994, Interac Direct Payment has become so widespread that, as of 2001, more transactions in Canada were completed using debit cards than cash. This popularity may be partially attributable to two main factors: the convenience of not having to carry cash, and the availability of <b>automated</b> <b>bank</b> machines (ABMs) and Direct Payment merchants on the network.|$|R

40|$|Relationships between {{liveness}} and mediatization must be reconsidered so that, where appropriate, mediatization may {{be construed}} as a productive way to project new and necessary understandings of musical meaning. A static livelrecorded binarism, in light of such arguments, no longer seems appropriate. By hearing Glenn Gould's body in his recordings, we hear his liveness. Not only can we then rethink our common conceptions of Gould's musicianship, but also our common conceptions of recorded music. An awareness of liveness {{reminds us of the}} sociality of music by emphasizing its performance, even when conventional indicators of performance become reconfigured by the very acts of mediatization I emphasize here.
