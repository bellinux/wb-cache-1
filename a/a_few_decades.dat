The southern resident community alone had lost 48 of its members to captivity; by 1976, only 80 remained.

In the 1870s, however, several publications corrected the dating and within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>decades</b> 1535 became the generally accepted date.

5|$|At {{this time}} though the {{chemical}} {{nature of what}} exactly in the blood conferred this protection was not known. In <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>decades</b> to follow, it was shown that the protective serum could neutralize and precipitate toxins, and clump bacteria. All these functions were attributed to different substances in the serum, and named accordingly as antitoxin, precipitin and agglutinin. That all the three substances were one entity (gamma globulins) was demonstrated by Elvin A. Kabat in 1939. In the preceding year Kabat had demonstrated the heterogeneity of antibodies through ultracentrifugation studies of horses' sera.|$|E
5|$|Besides their {{obligations}} as obedient, peaceful and nonpolitical {{inhabitants of the}} Grand Duchy, who had <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>decades</b> earlier accepted the class system as {{the natural order of}} their life, the commoners began to ask for and demand their civil rights and citizenship in Finnish society. The power struggle between the Finnish estates and the Russian administration gave a concrete role model and free space for the labor movement. On the other side, due to at least a century-long tradition and experience of administrative leadership, the Finnish elite saw itself as the inherent natural power.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of his death, Massenet was {{regarded}} by many critics as old-fashioned and unadventurous although his two best-known operas remained popular in France and abroad. After <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>decades</b> of neglect, his works began to be favourably reassessed during the mid-20th century, and many of them have since been staged and recorded. Although critics do not rank him among the handful of outstanding operatic geniuses such as Mozart, Verdi and Wagner, his operas are now widely accepted as well-crafted and intelligent products of the Belle Époque.|$|E
5|$|Gatwick Airport, {{nowadays}} one of Britain's busiest international airports, {{opened on}} the edge of the town in the 1940s, encouraging commercial and industrial growth. After the Second World War, the British Government planned to move large numbers of people and jobs out of London and into new towns around South East England. The New Towns Act 1946 designated Crawley as the site of one of these. A master plan was developed for the establishment of new residential, commercial, industrial and civic areas, and rapid development greatly increased the size and population of the town over <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>decades.</b>|$|E
5|$|In volume 1 of Systema Naturae, Linnaeus (1758) {{described}} seventeen {{species of}} ants, {{all of which}} he placed in the single genus Formica.

The ant species described by Linnaeus are now dispersed in eleven different genera, belonging to four subfamilies.|$|E

5|$|Most {{settlers}} in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>decades</b> {{as varied as}} the settlements. Cash crops included tobacco, rice and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late colonial period Americans were producing one-seventh of the world's iron supply. Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of Scotch-Irish and other groups. As coastal land grew more expensive, freed indentured servants pushed further west.|$|E
5|$|Other major plot {{elements}} were the 1937 marriage of Winnie to engineer Will Wright and {{the disappearance of}} Will during World War II, leaving a pregnant Winnie behind. This realistic and unfortunate situation was too risqué for some newspapers: The Baltimore Sun dropped the strip early in 1941 because of the pregnancy of Winnie. The comic strip changed significantly over the years; with Winnie working in the fashion industry after the war, seemingly as a widow until her husband returned after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>decades.</b> She took on various other jobs and endeavors over the years, including {{a stint in the}} Peace Corps.|$|E
5|$|Salona, {{the capital}} of the {{province}} of Dalmatia was sacked and destroyed in 614 by Avars and Slavs. The population fled to Diocletian's walled palace of Split, which was able to hold up. Thereafter, Split rose quickly in importance, as one of Dalmatia's major cities. After <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>decades,</b> the Avars were driven out by the Croats. This probably happened after 620, when in second wave Croats migrated on the invitation by the Emperor Heraclius to counter the Avar threat on the Byzantine Empire.|$|E

40|$|Mars is a {{compelling}} astrobiological target, and ahuman mission would {{provide an opportunity to}} collect immense amounts of scientific data. Exploration alone, however, cannot justify the increased risk. Instead, three factors drive ahuman mission: economics, education, and exploration. Ahuman mission has a unique potential to inspire the next generation of young people to enter critically needed science and engineering disciplines. A mission is economically feasible, and the research and development program put in place for ahuman mission would propel growth in related high-technology industries. The main hurdles are human physiological responses to 1 – 2 years of radiation and microgravity exposure. However, enabling technologies are sufficiently mature in these areas that they can be developed within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>decade</b> timescale. Hence, the decision of whether or not to undertake ahuman mission to Mars is a political decision, and thus, educational and economic benefits are the crucial factors...|$|R

By October 1548, he had assembled another 12,000-strong force that also included about 400 Portuguese mercenaries led by Diogo Soares.

In only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>decades</b> its fortunes declined when a rail line was built from Launceston, reaching nearby Carrick in 1869. The economy of rail transport took goods and passengers away, forcing wagons from the road.

As of 2004 it was run as a restaurant and, after a 2008 refurbishment, has been used for accommodation and a cooking school.|$|E

5|$|All {{copernicium}} isotopes {{are extremely}} unstable and radioactive; in general, heavier isotopes are {{more stable than}} the lighter.

Other isotopes have half-lives shorter than 0.1seconds. 281Cn and 284Cn both have half-lives of 97ms, {{and the other two}} isotopes have half-lives slightly under one millisecond. It is predicted that the heavy isotopes 291Cn and 293Cn may have half-lives longer than <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>decades,</b> and may have been produced in the r-process and be detectable in cosmic rays, though they would be about 10−12 times as abundant as lead.|$|E
5|$|Although for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>decades</b> (since {{the times}} of the Silent Sejm) Russia had seen a weak Poland as its own protectorate, Poland had also been devastated by a civil war in which {{the forces of the}} Bar Confederation {{attempted}} to disrupt Russian control over Poland. The recent Koliyivschyna peasant and Cossack uprising in Ukraine also weakened Poland's position. Further, the Russian-supported Polish king, Stanisław August Poniatowski, was seen as both weak and too independent-minded; eventually the Russian court decided that the usefulness of Poland as a protectorate had diminished. The three powers officially justified their actions as a compensation for dealing with a troublesome neighbor and restoring order in Poland through military intervention (the Bar Confederation provided a convenient excuse); in fact all three were interested in territorial gains.|$|E
5|$|By 1100, {{there were}} several Crusader states, {{including}} the Principality of Antioch, founded by Bohemond in 1098. It was argued that Antioch {{should be returned to}} the Byzantines, despite Alexios's supposed betrayals, but Bohemond claimed it for himself. Alexios, of course, disagreed; Antioch had an important port, was a trade hub with Asia and a stronghold of the Eastern Orthodox Church, with an important Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch. It had only been captured from the empire <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>decades</b> previously, unlike Jerusalem, which was much farther away and had not been in Byzantine hands for centuries. Alexios therefore did not recognize the legitimacy of the Principality, believing it should be returned to the Empire according to the oaths Bohemond had sworn in 1097.
