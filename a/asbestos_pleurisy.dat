40|$|Objective: Tumor {{biomarkers}} {{are promising}} study areas {{for the early}} or differential diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of analyzing serum N-ERC/mesothelin, C-ERC/mesothelin, hyaluronan, osteopontin, and syndecan- 1 levels for distinguishing patients with MPM from those with metastatic malignant pleural diseases (MMPDs), benign pleural diseases (BPDs), and benign <b>asbestos</b> <b>pleurisy</b> (BAP). Methods: Tumor biomarker levels of serum samples of 230 cases were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: All investigated biomarkers did not reveal sufficient diagnostic information to distinguish MPM from MMPD. N-ERC/mesothelin showed moderate ability to distinguish MPM from BPDs and particularly BAP (sensitivities of 67...|$|E
40|$|Endemic pleural plaques are {{reported}} from {{many parts of}} the world. In Central Europe and in Finland no connection with malignant mesotheliomas has been found, whereas this tumour is often encountered in areas in Turkey where endemic plaques also occur. There seem, however, to be differences in the radiological appearances found in these areas. In the present study chest radiographs of 317 persons with pleural plaques from the endemic area of Finland were scrutinized. It was found that 4. 7 % showed a blunted costophrenic angle unilaterally and 0. 9 % bilaterally. The prevalence of sequelae of pleurisy is statistically very highly significantly lower than in people with pleural plaques in Turkey. As the risk of mesothelioma appears to be low in Finland, the results are in accordance with the hypothesis that the risk of mesothelioma in a given population is higher if in that population there is a high incidence of benign <b>asbestos</b> <b>pleurisy...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Six {{patients}} with radiographic evidence of diffuse pleural thickening after industrial asbestos exposure are described. Five had computed tomography of the thorax. All the scans showed marked circumferential pleural thickening often with calcification, and four {{showed no significant}} evidence of intrapulmonary fibrosis (asbestosis). Lung function testing showed reduc-tion of the inspiratory capacity and the single-breath carbon monoxide transfer factor (TLco). The transfer coefficient, calculated as the TLCO divided by the alveolar volume determined by helium dilution during the measurement of TLco, was increased. Pseudo-static compliance curves showed markedly more negative intrapleural pressures at all lung volumes than found in normal people. These {{results suggest that the}} circumferential pleural thickening was preventing normal lung expansion despite abnormally great distending pressures. The pattern of lung function tests is sufficiently distinctive for it to be recognised in clinical practice, and suggests that the lungs are held rigidly within an abnormal pleura. The pleural thickening in our patients may have been related to the condition described as "benign <b>asbestos</b> <b>pleurisy</b> " rather than the interstitial fibrosis of asbestosis. Malignant pleural effusion associated with meso-thelioma or bronchial carcinoma is a recognised complication of asbestos exposure. Pleural effusions without obvious tumour among both asbestos workers and ex-workers were first re-ported by Eisenstadt. ' Originally called "asbestos pleurisy " the condition was later called "benign asbestos pleurisy," 2 although one of the first four reported patients developed a pleural mesothelioma 10 years after his effusion first appeared, and another after 12 years. Further cases were subse-quently reported 538 and the clinical features were recognised (table 1). Diagnostic thoracotomy wa...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundSeveral {{studies have}} already {{addressed}} the potential {{role of an}} increased fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18 F FDG) uptake in identification of pleural malignancy. In this pilot study, we investigate the role of 18 F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for differentiating asbestos-related benign pleural disease from malignant mesothelioma. Materials and MethodsThe study population comprised 31 consecutive patients (17 malignant mesotheliomas, nine benign <b>asbestos</b> <b>pleurisies,</b> and five diffuse pleural fibrosis) {{with a mean age}} of 61 years between January 2006 and December 2008. Thoracoscopy or image-guided pleural needle biopsy were systematically performed to reveal pathologic diagnosis and/or clinical follow-up for at least 3 years for presence or absence of malignant pleural effusion. ROCs analyses for standardized uptake value (SUV) adjusted to body weight were calculated between benign and malignant pleural diseases. Results 18 F-FDG PET/CT imaging correctly detected the presence of malignancies in 15 of 17 patients with malignant mesothelioma for sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of 88. 2 %, 92. 9 %, and 90. 3 %, respectively. 18 F-FDG PET/CT imaging correctly identified 13 of 14 cases of benign pleural disease. The mean SUV values were 6. 5 ± 3. 4 for malignant mesothelioma cases and 0. 8 ± 0. 6 for benign pleural diseases (p < 0. 001). When we compared the two groups of pleural disease, a cut-off value of 2. 2 for SUV gave the best accuracy with 94. 1 %, 100 %, 100 %, and 93. 3 % for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, respectively. ConclusionPreliminary results of this trial provide evidence that 18 F-FDG PET/CT imaging is a highly accurate and reliable noninvasive test to decide for further investigation of differentiating malignant mesothelioma from benign pleural disease...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Malignant pleural {{mesothelioma}} (MPM) is an aggressive tumor with a poor prognosis. microRNA- 34 b/c (miR- 34 b/c), which {{plays an important}} role in the pathogenesis of MPM, is frequently downregulated by DNA methylation in approximately 90 % of MPM cases. In this study, we estimated the degree of miR- 34 b/c methylation in serum-circulating DNA using a digital methylation specific PCR assay (MSP). Materials and methods: A real-time MSP assay was performed using the SYBR Green method. The melting temperature (Tm) of each PCR product was examined using a melting curve analysis. For a digital MSP assay, 40 wells were analyzed per sample. A total of 110 serum samples from 48 MPM cases, 21 benign <b>asbestos</b> <b>pleurisy</b> (BAP) cases, and 41 healthy volunteers (HVs) were examined. Results: Positive range of Tm value for miR- 34 b/c methylation was defined as 77. 71 - 78. 79 degrees C which was the mean 3 standard deviations of 40 wells of a positive control. The number of miR- 34 b/c methylated wells was counted per sample according to this criterion. The number of miR- 34 b/c methylated wells in MPM cases was significantly higher than that in BAP cases (P = 0. 03) or HVs (P < 0. 001). Advanced MPM cases tended to have higher number of miR- 34 b/c methylated wells than early MPM cases. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that three number of miR- 34 b/c methylated wells per sample was the best cut-off of positivity of MPM with a 67 % of sensitivity and a 77 % specificity for prediction. The area under the ROC curve was 0. 77. Conclusions: Our digital MSP assay can quantify miR- 34 b/c methylation in serum-circulating DNA. The degree of miR- 34 b/c methylation in serum-circulating DNA is associated with MPM, suggesting that this approach might be useful for the establishment of a new detection system for MPM...|$|E
