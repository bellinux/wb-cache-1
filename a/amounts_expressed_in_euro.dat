Although it accounts for only a relatively small percentage of all cancer types, the costs associated with managing multiple myeloma are considerable. Available studies are mainly focused on health care costs. The Costo del Mieloma Multiplo (Cost of MM, CoMiM) study investigated the cost of illness of multiple myeloma in Italy during one year of disease management. METHODS: CoMiM is a retrospective, prevalence-based, multi-center, cross-sectional study based on a stratified sample of patients seen during normal clinical practice (asymptomatic; symptomatic on drugs; symptomatic receiving autologous stem cell transplantation; plateau/remission). Demographics, clinical history, health care and non-health care resource consumption data were collected.

This study aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of minimal contact psychotherapy, based on Lewinsohn's 'Coping with depression' course, targeted at opportunistically screened individuals with sub-threshold depression. Methods and Results: Using a Markov model, future health effects and costs of an intervention scenario and a current practice scenario were estimated. The time horizon was five years. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>euro</b> per Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was employed to study the effect of uncertainty in the model parameters. From the health care perspective the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was € 1, 400 per DALY, and from the societal perspective the intervention was cost-saving. Although the estimated incremental costs and effects were surrounded with large uncertainty, given a willingness to pay of € 20, 000 per DALY, the probability that the intervention is cost-effective was around 80 %. Conclusion: This modelling study showed that opportunistic screening in primary care for sub-threshold depression in combination with minimal contact psychotherapy may be cost-effective in the prevention of major depression...|$|R

Two scenarios were considered in which cetuximab was discontinued either at 6 weeks or at 12 weeks if there was no tumour response at those time points. Cost-effectiveness was <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>Euros</b> as the additional cost per additional life year gained (LYG) (referred to as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)).

The answer is that price levels are different between countries, and that is very much the case between wealthy industrialized nations and poorer developing countries. If one earns five local dollars a day and it costs only two to live, then survival at least is possible.

The cohort was defined as the population of subjects receiving at least one prescription of any antimicrobial agent for systemic use, classified according to their therapeutic role using Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification.

Conclusions The present work shows a reduction in the consumption and expenditure for antibiotic drugs in Campania region, although above the national average yet. Further studies are needed to assess the effects of appropriateness policies recently established by regional authorities...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to compare Italian healthcare-related costs and {{effectiveness}} of 7 - and 5 - day course with telitromicin (Ketek®) 800 mg od vs. 10 -day clarithromycin 500 mg bid in patients with Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB), respectively. Clinical as well as healthcare-related resource consumption {{data were collected from}} two Medline indexed articles reporting results of three international trials. Since differences in effectiveness among the compared antibiotic courses did not reach statistical significance, two cost-minimization analyses were performed from Italian National Healthcare Service (INHS) perspective. CAP and AECB-related hospitalizations were evaluated according to INHS DRGs tariffs, whereas drugs were costed according to Italian National Therapeutic Formulary. Costs are <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>euros</b> 2005. When compared to 10 -day clarithromycin 500 mg bid, savings related to 7 -day telitromicin 800 mg od approach 102, 10 euros per CAP patient (IC 95 : - 177, 89 euros − - 26, 31 euros; p< 0, 01). In comparison with 10 -day clarithromycin 500 mg bid, 5 -day telitromicin 800 mg od allows saving for 79, 78 euros per AECB patient (IC 95 : - 125, 42 euros  - 34, 15 euros; p< 0, 001). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of basecase results. Telitromicin induces savings related to both antibiotic course and hospitalization. Results should be confirmed via empirical health economic studies carried out in Italy...|$|R
