40|$|The current paper {{provides}} {{the details of}} the main sources of uncertainty that occur when conventional mass determinations are performed in <b>analytical</b> <b>balances.</b> The data presented correspond to the calibration of 18 <b>analytical</b> <b>balances</b> that belong to LATU, together with the detailed quantification of each of the sources of uncertainty. The results of a comparison of conventional mass measurement performed in those balances with a Teflon sample are assessed, considering their uncertainty values. Conclusions are subsequently drawn on conventional mass measurement´s reproducibility in <b>analytical</b> <b>balances</b> in LATU...|$|R

40|$|A {{description}} is given of a device {{for determining the}} relative humidity of samples, particularly pulverized samples, using an <b>analytical</b> <b>balance</b> (1) weighs the samples taken. The <b>analytical</b> <b>balance</b> then transmits a weight-proportional output signal to an electronic control and analysis unit which calculates the relative humidity of the sample from time-average readings by way of extrapolation. The said invention also includes a heating device (3) which heats the sample in the balance pan (2) of the <b>analytical</b> <b>balance</b> (1). According to the invention, a characteristic feature of the device is that the control and analysis unit calculates the average relative humidity {{from a number of}} weight values extrapolated from a series of measured value tuples defined during the heating process.
