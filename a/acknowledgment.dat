40|$|This paper {{describes}} the goals, approach, implementation, {{and performance of}} Mflow, a multicast flow control protocol. Our work focuses {{on the issues that}} arise from the increase in <b>acknowledgments</b> that occur as the size of the group grows. Mflow makes use of bulk <b>acknowledgments</b> to substantially reduce the number of <b>acknowledgments</b> per multicast message. It also staggers <b>acknowledgments</b> from different destinations to avoid storms of messages. We demonstrate that staggering can both decrease the number of <b>acknowledgments</b> needed for effective flow control as well as increase the robustness of the protocol to changes in the environment. We analyze both message and computation efficiency of Mflow. The protocol is computationally efficient and performs well in our experiments...|$|R

5|$|After the {{completion}} of the film's 175-day run, novelist S. P. Chary accused the film of being based on a novel that he had written and published as a serial under the title Chanderi in a monthly magazine in 1998. He demanded that filmmakers compensate him for using his idea without consent, and threatened to take legal action if the producers did not heed his demands, or remade the film in another language. He added that he deserved to be credited for the story and alleged that Allu Arjun and Allu Sirish were trying to postpone his <b>acknowledgment</b> by discussing the issue with him.|$|E
5|$|David Brooks {{argued that}} a more {{fundamental}} shift from a materialist to a post-materialist mindset has occurred in recent generations. While for generations born early in the century increased income {{was the same as}} improvements in lifestyle this is no longer true for people born into an affluent, information driven world. Younger generations live much more intellectually diverse lives and cites much user generated content as being mostly produced outside of the monetary economy. He affirms Cowen's <b>acknowledgment</b> that this has brought large increases in human happiness with correspondingly little economic activity.|$|E

5|$|Female {{homosexuality}} has {{not received}} the same negative response from religious or criminal authorities as male homosexuality or adultery has throughout history. Whereas sodomy between men, men and women, and men and animals was punishable by death in Britain, <b>acknowledgment</b> of sexual contact between women was nonexistent in medical and legal texts. The earliest law against female homosexuality appeared in France in 1270. In Spain, Italy, and the Holy Roman Empire, sodomy between women was included in acts considered unnatural and punishable by burning to death, although few instances are recorded of this taking place.|$|E
5|$|Having been {{ratified}} by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several states (27 of the 36 states, including those {{that had been in}} rebellion), Secretary of State Seward, on December 18, 1865, certified that the Thirteenth Amendment had become valid, to all intents and purposes, {{as a part of the}} Constitution.

5|$|In June 1942, {{shortly after}} the Navy's public <b>acknowledgment</b> of the sinking, workers at the Quincy shipyard, where the ship had been built twenty-one years earlier, cabled Navy Secretary Frank Knox and {{proposed}} {{a change in the}} name of one of the new Essex-class fleet carriers currently under construction there to Lexington (from Cabot). Knox agreed to the proposal and the carrier was renamed as the fifth Lexington on 16 June 1942. On 17 February 1943, her successor was formally commissioned as USS Lexington (CV-16), which served as the flagship of Task Force 58 (TF 58) during the Battle of the Philippine Sea and remained in service until 1991.|$|E

40|$|When saying {{something}} in a conversation, an agent publicly commits to some interpretation of what she said, which others might dispute. But how does making a commitment affects the commitments of others? We provide an {{answer to this question}} for the case of <b>acknowledgments.</b> Commitment semantics poses a dilemma for acknowledgments: either the semantics is strong, entailing that agent i’s committing to j entails other agents commit to i’s committing to j. This makes <b>acknowledgments</b> vacuous. Or further <b>acknowledgments</b> are required to produce commitments about others’ commitments, but then grounding seems never achievable in finite time. Building on Venant & Asher (2015) we provide a model of these strong and weak semantics where we show how the two are linked via a semantics for inductive, synchronous <b>acknowledgments...</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1250 or 1251, Mindaugas {{agreed to}} receive baptism and {{relinquish}} control over some lands in western Lithuania, {{in return for}} an <b>acknowledgment</b> by Pope Innocent IV as king. The Pope welcomed a Christian Lithuania as a bulwark against Mongol threats; in turn, Mindaugas sought papal intervention in the ongoing Lithuanian conflicts with the Christian orders. On 17 July 1251, the pope signed two crucial papal bulls. One ordered the Bishop of Chełmno to crown Mindaugas as King of Lithuania, appoint a bishop for Lithuania, and build a cathedral. The other bull specified that the new bishop was to be directly subordinate to the Holy See, {{rather than to the}} Archbishop of Riga. This autonomy was a welcome development. The precise date of Mindaugas's baptism is not known. His wife, two sons, and members of his court were baptized; Pope Innocent wrote later that a multitude of Mindaugas's subjects also received Christianity.|$|E
5|$|In East Anglia, Rædwald's {{conversion}} was {{not universally}} accepted by his household {{or his own}} queen. According to the historian Steven Plunkett, she and her pagan teachers persuaded him to default in part from {{his commitment to the}} Christian faith. As a result, he kept in the temple two altars, one pagan and another dedicated to Christ. Bede, writing decades later, described how Ealdwulf of East Anglia, a grandson of Rædwald's brother Eni, recalled seeing the temple when he was a boy. It may have been located at Rendlesham, emerging focus of the regio of the Wuffing dynasty, according to Plunkett. Barbara Yorke explains the dual nature of the temple by suggesting that Rædwald would have been unprepared to reject his old religion and fully embrace Christianity, as this act would have been a public <b>acknowledgment</b> of his inferiority to Æthelberht. Rædwald's lack of commitment towards Christianity earned him the enmity of Bede, who regarded him as a renouncer of the faith.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party {{reported}} on the discovery of copernicium and acknowledged {{the discovery of the}} isotope 283Cn. This implied the de facto discovery of the livermorium-291 isotope, from the <b>acknowledgment</b> of the data relating to its granddaughter 283Cn, although the livermorium data was not absolutely critical for the demonstration of copernicium's discovery. Also in 2009, confirmation from Berkeley and the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Germany came for the flerovium isotopes 286 to 289, immediate daughters of the four known livermorium isotopes. In 2011, IUPAC evaluated the Dubna team experiments of 2000–2006. Whereas they found the earliest data (not involving 291Lv and 283Cn) inconclusive, the results of 2004–2006 were accepted as identification of livermorium, and the element was officially recognized as having been discovered.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} {{feedback}} in LT codes is investigated. The considered type of feedback is <b>acknowledgments,</b> where information on which symbols have been decoded {{is given to}} the transmitter. Our analysis reveals that <b>acknowledgments</b> has a very low potential in LT codes with standard degree distributions. Motivated by this, we analyze the impact of <b>acknowledgments</b> on multi-layer LT codes. In this case, feedback proves advantageous. By using only a single feedback message, it is possible to achieve a significant performance improvement compared to traditional LT codes. I...|$|R

5|$|On {{environmental}} issues, Mathias {{established a}} {{record as a}} strong advocate of the Chesapeake Bay. After touring the bay shoreline in 1973, he sponsored legislation {{that led to a}} study by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) two years later, which was one of the first reports that made the public aware of harmful levels of nutrients and toxins in the waters. As a result, the report was one of the catalysts for cleanup efforts, and evolved into the Chesapeake Bay Program. In recognition, the Charles Mathias Laboratory, part of the Smithsonian Institution, was established in 1988 as a research facility to analyze human impact on the bay. In 1990, the Mathias Medal was established by Maryland Sea Grant at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science as further <b>acknowledgment</b> of Mathias' environmental record. In 2003, thirty years after he launched a study of the Chesapeake, Mathias was recognized by the Army Corps of Engineers for the influential role he played initiating restoration efforts.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} {{exhibited a}} contrast of bare nave walls against the paintings {{drawn on the}} metal ceilings leading to the main altar and retablo mayor. The ceiling paintings {{were known to be}} works of Raymundo Francia, as shown by his signature on one corner of the dome in the 1930s. An <b>acknowledgment</b> on the initiative of the San Tarcisio Martir Maribojoc Catholic Association 'Comité de Obras' could also be seen painted before the crossing. Several paintings by Francia on metal had deteriorated even before the total destruction of the church by earthquake in 2013. The Francia paintings were never touched up nor repainted. The new church dome (or cimborrio) was constructed in June 1889. Ray Francia was again commissioned to do mural works on the cimborrio by painting the Epistles of The Four Apostles, namely the saints John, Matthew, Luke and Mark.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{received}} general critical acclaim, with critics praising Gaga's singing abilities, the theatricality of the show, and {{her sense}} of style and fashion. The Monster Ball was a commercial success, with sold-out shows and demand for tickets prompting organizers to add more dates to the itinerary. It ultimately grossed an estimated US$227.4million from 200reported shows and an audience of 2.5million. At the 2010 Billboard Touring Awards, Gaga won the Breakthrough Performer Award, {{as well as the}} Concert Marketing & Promotion Award, the latter being an <b>acknowledgment</b> of her partnership with sponsor Virgin Mobile. HBO filmed a special of The Monster Ball Tour during Gaga's February 2011 shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City.
