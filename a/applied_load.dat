25|$|In Euler buckling, {{when the}} <b>applied</b> <b>load</b> is {{increased}} {{by a small}} amount beyond the critical load, the structure deforms into a buckled configuration which is adjacent to the original configuration. For example, the Euler column pictured will start to bow when loaded slightly above its critical load, but will not suddenly collapse.|$|E
25|$|In {{most cases}} the <b>applied</b> <b>load</b> is carried by {{pressure}} generated within the fluid due to the frictional viscous resistance to motion of the lubricating fluid between the surfaces. Adequate lubrication allows smooth continuous operation of equipment, with only mild wear, and without excessive stresses or seizures at bearings. When lubrication breaks down, metal or other components can rub destructively over each other, causing heat and possibly damage or failure.|$|E
40|$|Metal forming is used synonymously with deformation, {{a process}} during which an object gets changed {{due to the}} applied force. These changes can either be {{reversible}} or irreversible {{depending on the type}} of material; size and geometry of the object and the magnitude of the applied force to the object. This paper reports the microstructural development after mechanical forming of steel sheet material by varying the <b>applied</b> <b>loads.</b> The microstructural evaluations showed that the <b>applied</b> <b>loads</b> employed caused an increase in the magnitude of the grain sizes in each loaded specimen. Furthermore, the increase in the grain size of the microstructure was observed to be directly proportional to the <b>loads</b> <b>applied.</b> In addition, the microhardness values of the cross sections investigated were found to increase with the <b>applied</b> <b>loads.</b> Hence, the grain size growth and the hardness were linearly dependent on the <b>applied</b> <b>loads,</b> and this implies that there is a correlation between the <b>applied</b> <b>loads</b> and the resulting microstructure of the material and the hardness of the material...|$|R

Theory of elasticity combined with laser interferometric technique into technique for measurement of residual stresses in solid objects - usually in thin, nominally-flat plates. Measurements particularly useful in inspection of wafers of single-crystal silicon for making solar cells or integrated circuits, because stresses remaining after crystal-growing process cause buckling or fracture. Used to predict deflections of plates caused by known <b>applied</b> <b>loads</b> under specified boundary condition, or to infer <b>applied</b> <b>loads</b> that cause known deflections.

25|$|Colloidal {{suspensions}} of nanoparticles of {{boric acid}} dissolved in petroleum {{or vegetable oil}} can form a remarkable lubricant on ceramic or metal surfaces with a coefficient of sliding friction that decreases with increasing pressure to a value ranging from 0.10 to 0.02. Self-lubricating H3BO3 films result from a spontaneous chemical reaction between water molecules and B2O3 coatings in a humid environment. In bulk-scale, an inverse relationship exists between friction coefficient and Hertzian contact pressure induced by <b>applied</b> <b>load.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{assessing}} rated amplifier power output, it {{is useful}} to consider the <b>applied</b> <b>load,</b> the signal type (e.g., speech or music), required power output duration (i.e., short-time or continuous), and required dynamic range (e.g., recorded or live audio). In high-powered audio applications that require long cables to the load (e.g., cinemas and shopping centres) it may be more efficient to connect to the load at line output voltage, with matching transformers at source and loads. This avoids long runs of heavy speaker cables.|$|E
25|$|The {{solutions}} {{are based on}} linear isotropic infinitesimal elasticity and Euler–Bernoulli beam theory. In other words, they contain the assumptions (among others) that the materials in question are elastic, that stress is related linearly to strain, that the material (but not the structure) behaves identically regardless of direction of the <b>applied</b> <b>load,</b> that all deformations are small, and that beams are long relative to their depth. As with any simplifying assumption in engineering, the more the model strays from reality, the less useful (and more dangerous) the result.|$|E

25|$|The {{second type}} of bolted joint {{transfers}} the <b>applied</b> <b>load</b> in shear of the bolt shank and relies on the shear strength of the bolt. Tension loads on such a joint are only incidental. A preload is still applied but consideration of joint flexibility is not as critical {{as in the case}} where loads are transmitted through the joint in tension. Other such shear joints do not employ a preload on the bolt as they are designed to allow rotation of the joint about the bolt, but use other methods of maintaining bolt/joint integrity. Joints that allow rotation include clevis linkages, and rely on a locking mechanism (like lock washers, thread adhesives, and lock nuts).|$|E
25|$|Static {{friction}} is {{friction between}} {{two or more}} solid objects that are not moving relative to each other. For example, static friction can prevent an object from sliding down a sloped surface. The coefficient of static friction, typically denoted as μs, is usually higher than the coefficient of kinetic friction. Static friction is considered to arise {{as the result of}} surface roughness features across multiple length-scales at solid surfaces. These features, known as asperities are present down to nano-scale dimensions and result in true solid to solid contact existing only at a limited number of points accounting for {{only a fraction of the}} apparent or nominal contact area. The linearity between <b>applied</b> <b>load</b> and true contact area, arising from asperity deformation, gives rise to the linearity between static frictional force and normal force, found for typical Amonton-Coulomb type friction.|$|E
25|$|When a {{structure}} {{is subjected to}} compressive stress, buckling may occur. Buckling {{is characterized by a}} sudden sideways deflection of a structural member. This may occur even though the stresses that develop in the structure are well below those needed to cause failure of the material of which the structure is composed. As an <b>applied</b> <b>load</b> is increased on a member, such as a column, it will ultimately become large enough to cause the member to become unstable and it is said to have buckled. Further loading will cause significant and somewhat unpredictable deformations, possibly leading to complete loss of the member's load-carrying capacity. If the deformations that occur after buckling do not cause the complete collapse of that member, the member will continue to support the load that caused it to buckle. If the buckled member {{is part of a larger}} assemblage of components such as a building, any load applied to the buckled part of the structure beyond that which caused the member to buckle will be redistributed within the structure.|$|E

40|$|NiTi {{shape memory}} alloy samples were plasma-implanted with {{nitrogen}} at voltages ranging from - 10 to - 40 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results disclose the formation of gradient TiN layers which thicknesses and elemental in-depth distributions depend on the applied voltages. The effects of the implantation voltages on the wear characteristics were investigated by pin-on-disk tests. In the initial period of our friction test, the implanted samples exhibit low friction coefficients compared to the untreated sample. The wear resistance of the plasma-implanted NiTi samples increases with implantation voltages and decreases with the <b>applied</b> <b>loads.</b> Our results reveal that the wear mechanism of the implanted samples is adhesive-dominant under low <b>applied</b> <b>loads</b> but becomes abrasive-dominant at high <b>applied</b> <b>loads.</b> © 2006 Elsevier B.

2500|$|The {{compliance}} of rock layers {{is referred}} to as competence: a competent layer or bed of rock can withstand an <b>applied</b> <b>load</b> without collapsing and is relatively strong, while an incompetent layer is relatively weak. [...] When rock behaves as a fluid, {{as in the case of}} very weak rock such as rock salt, or any rock that is buried deeply enough, it typically shows flow folding (also called passive folding, because little resistance is offered): the strata appear shifted undistorted, assuming any shape impressed upon them by surrounding more rigid rocks. The strata simply serve as markers of the folding. Such folding is also a feature of many igneous intrusions and glacier ice.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBuckling and post-buckling {{analysis}} of extensible beam–columns is performed numerically in this paper. It was experienced earlier {{that in some}} cases the numerical integration would not produce the convergent post-buckling solutions, especially under high loads. Therefore, a new differential quadrature (DQ) based iterative numerical integration method is proposed to solve post-buckling differential equations of extensible beam–columns. Six cases, including five classical Euler buckling cases, are analyzed. Critical loads and convergent post-buckling solutions under different <b>applied</b> <b>loads</b> are obtained. The results are compared with the existing multiple scales solutions. It is found that under high <b>applied</b> <b>loads,</b> the small rotation assumption in obtaining multiple scales solutions is no longer valid. The proposed iterative DQ based numerical integration method can yield reliable and accurate post-buckling solutions even at high <b>applied</b> <b>loads</b> for the cases investigated...|$|R

2500|$|The {{theory of}} the {{behavior}} of columns was investigated in 1757 by mathematician Leonhard Euler. He derived the formula, the Euler formula, that gives the maximum axial load that a long, slender, ideal column can carry without buckling. An ideal column is one that is perfectly straight, made of a homogeneous material, and free from initial stress. When the <b>applied</b> <b>load</b> reaches the Euler load, sometimes called the critical load, the column comes to be in a state of unstable equilibrium. At that load, the introduction of the slightest lateral force will cause the column to fail by suddenly [...] "jumping" [...] to a new configuration, and the column is said to have buckled. This is what happens when a person stands on an empty aluminum can and then taps the sides briefly, causing it to then become instantly crushed (the vertical sides of the can understood as an infinite series of extremely thin columns). The formula derived by Euler for long slender columns is given below.|$|E

40|$|Solving for the {{displacements}} of free-free coupled systems {{acted upon}} by static loads {{is a common}} task in the aerospace industry. Often, these problems are solved by static analysis with inertia relief. This technique allows for a free-free static analysis by balancing the <b>applied</b> <b>loads</b> with the inertia loads generated by the <b>applied</b> <b>loads.</b> For some engineering applications, the displacements of the free-free coupled system induce additional static <b>loads.</b> Hence, the <b>applied</b> <b>loads</b> are equal to the original loads plus the displacement-dependent loads. A launch vehicle being acted upon by an aerodynamic loading can have such <b>applied</b> <b>loads.</b> The final displacements of such systems are commonly determined with iterative solution techniques. Unfortunately, these techniques can be time consuming and labor intensive. Because the coupled system equations for free-free systems with displacement-dependent loads can be written in closed form, it is advantageous to solve for the displacements in this manner. Implementing closed-form equations in static analysis with inertia relief is analogous to implementing transfer functions in dynamic analysis. An MSC/NASTRAN (MacNeal-Schwendler Corporation/NASA Structural Analysis) DMAP (Direct Matrix Abstraction Program) Alter was used to include displacement-dependent loads in static analysis with inertia relief. It efficiently solved a common aerospace problem that typically has been solved with an iterative technique...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The present {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with estimating the reliability of un-derground pipelines subject o externally <b>applied</b> <b>loading</b> and to corrosion, either externally or internally, or both. This affects {{the strength of the}} pipeline in resisting the <b>applied</b> <b>loads</b> so that the reliability would be expected to decrease with time. Corrosion is a phenomenon about which {{there is a great deal}} of uncertainty, One way of allowing for this is through probabilistic modeling of the material loss as a nonlinear function of time. This approach isexplored in the present paper, using a nonlinear function first postulated for atmospheric corrosion. This model is in-corporated into expressions for stress resulting from externally <b>applied</b> <b>loading</b> and internal pressure to provide alimit state function expressing the boundary between survival nd failure of the system. The probability of system failure is then evaluated using techniques developed for structural reliability analysis...|$|R
