5|$|Clear cell {{carcinoma}} is a Type II endometrial tumor {{that makes up}} less than 5% of diagnosed endometrial cancer. Like serous {{cell carcinoma}}, it is usually aggressive and carries a poor prognosis. Histologically, it {{is characterized by the}} features common to <b>all</b> <b>clear</b> cells: the eponymous clear cytoplasm when H stained and visible, distinct cell membranes. The p53 cell signaling system is not active in endometrial clear cell carcinoma. This form of endometrial cancer is more common in postmenopausal women.|$|E
5|$|Cross-linguistically, the-ma suffix may {{be related}} to a coverbial suffix in Jaminjung, a {{language}} in which coverb roots occur without any aspect markers, but are then suffixed with -mayan, which marks continuous aspect. This coverb suffix bears a striking resemblance to the sum of the Wagiman -ma suffix and the continuous aspect suffix -yan, which always occur in tandem on coverbs. Together, -ma and -yan perform the same semantic function as Jaminjung -mayan. Precisely what the relationship holds between these suffixes; whether one language borrowed from the other, or whether each language inherited them from earlier languages, is not at <b>all</b> <b>clear.</b>|$|E

5|$|A major {{accident}} {{occurred at the}} bridge in August 1931. The paddle steamer E.R.O. struck the lift span of the bridge. The span had not been raised to a high enough level, causing it to clip {{the top of the}} steamer's funnel and rip apart the upper deck. High pressure steam was released during the accident causing some onlookers to believe the boat was on fire. It was at first thought the captain would be found amongst the wreckage of the upper deck, but he had been navigating the boat from the lower deck at that time. The captain displayed considerable skill; he immediately realised that further raising of the span despite being given the <b>all</b> <b>clear</b> meant it was not quite high enough. And through his actions as the boat progressed downstream caught in the current, he prevented the boat becoming stuck at the bridge.|$|E
5|$|After Narelle {{moved into}} TCWC Perth's area of {{responsibility}} on 9 January, a cyclone watch was issued for areas between Whim Creek and Coral Bay. A blue alert, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) lowest level of readiness, was also issued for areas between Mardie and Whim Creek. The following day, the watch was upgraded to a cyclone warning for all areas and a new watch was issued to the west, encompassing areas as far as Cape Cuvier. The watch was further extended early on 11 January to include areas between Cape Cuvier and Carnarvon. As the storm continued on a more westward path than initially anticipated, the warning area was gradually decreased, with areas east of Roebourne receiving the <b>all</b> <b>clear</b> later on 11 January.

5|$|In 1992 a {{party of}} French {{academics}} attended a condensed matter conference in Ukraine where physicist Daniel Beysens introduced them {{to the story of}} how ancient Theodosia was supplied with water from dew condensers. They were sufficiently intrigued that in 1993 they went to see for themselves. They concluded that the mounds that Zibold identified as dew condensers were in fact ancient burial mounds (a part of the necropolis of antic Theodosia) and that the pipes were medieval in origin and not associated with the mounds. They found the remains of Zibold's condenser, which they tidied up and examined closely. Zibold's condenser had apparently performed reasonably well, but in fact his exact results are not at <b>all</b> <b>clear,</b> and {{it is possible that the}} collector was intercepting fog, which added significantly to the yield. If Zibold's condenser worked at all, this was probably due to fact that a few stones near the surface of the mound were able to lose heat at night while being thermally isolated from the ground; however, it could never have produced the yield that Zibold envisaged.|$|E
