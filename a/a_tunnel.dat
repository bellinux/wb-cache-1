5|$|In 1978, Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade and Douglas studied four {{options for}} <b>a</b> <b>tunnel</b> from Brooklyn to New Jersey, some {{involving}} <b>a</b> <b>tunnel</b> to Staten Island. These included {{an option for}} <b>a</b> <b>tunnel</b> directly from Greenville Yard to the Bay Ridge Branch, and a link from New Jersey to Manhattan. Also under consideration was a single-tube tunnel with accommodations for electric units only. The Greenville–Brooklyn tunnel would be about $331 million, which was cheaper than the approximately $405 million tunnel from Staten Island to Brooklyn.|$|E

50|$|The TWT was <b>a</b> {{blow-down}} type <b>tunnel.</b> In {{contrast to}} <b>a</b> continuous wind <b>tunnel,</b> <b>a</b> blow-down wind <b>tunnel</b> only provides air for short period. <b>A</b> continuous wind <b>tunnel</b> {{is driven by}} large fans and typically is only capable of subsonic speeds. Because <b>a</b> blow-down <b>tunnel</b> can build up pressure {{over a long period}} time, it can release air at faster speeds.|$|R

5|$|A {{detailed}} {{proposal was}} presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. It {{became clear that}} Berg would not be served by the Ring Line. Many neighbours to {{the route of the}} Sognsvann Line complained about this proposal, stating that they had hoped that the section from Majorstuen to Berg would have been rebuilt as <b>a</b> <b>tunnel.</b> They also argued that it was irrational that the line was running at-grade in densely populated areas, while it would run in <b>a</b> <b>tunnel</b> through the then mostly unpopulated Nydalen. To compensate, Oslo Sporveier stated that they would build noise screens along the line. Also, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration protested to the plans, and stated that funding should be allocated to upgrading Ring 3 to six lanes before public transport investments were made in the area.|$|E

40|$|Cross-borehole {{pulse radar}} has been {{employed}} {{to detect a}} deeply located empty tunnel. In this paper, effects of underground water collected {{in the bottom of}} <b>an</b> empty <b>tunnel</b> on cross-borehole pulse radar signatures are analyzed numerically. B-scan images, stacks of received pulses, are calculated by applying the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method for 6 different heights of water from the bottom to the half height inside <b>an</b> empty <b>tunnel.</b> The most important features of <b>an</b> empty <b>tunnel,</b> the fastest time of peak (TOP) and time of arrival (TOA) extracted from the B-scan images, are slowed considerably depending on the increased height of water inside the tunnel. To compensate the weak TOP like that of <b>an</b> empty <b>tunnel,</b> <b>a</b> relation curve is formulated only utilizing measurable parameters of the fastest TOP and the fastest TOA. Then, a unified curve including the effects of two granites with the low and high dielectric properties is derived to cover widely varied dielectric properties of underground rocks. Based on the fastest TOP of <b>an</b> empty <b>tunnel,</b> the average difference between the fastest TOP of <b>an</b> empty <b>tunnel</b> and that of <b>a</b> partially water-filled <b>tunnel</b> decreases from 22. 92 % to 2. 59 % after enhancement...|$|R
