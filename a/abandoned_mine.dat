5|$|Nanticoke Creek loses {{water to}} mines and also {{receives}} <b>abandoned</b> <b>mine</b> drainage discharges from them. The Truesdale Mine Discharge, {{which is also}} known as the Dundee Outfall, discharges into the creek. In low-flow conditions, its flow ranges from 0 to 38 cubic feet per second. A smaller <b>abandoned</b> <b>mine</b> drainage discharge with a discharge of 0.01 to 0.06 cubic feet per second also discharges into the creek. It has a substantial concentration of dissolved aluminum, but low levels of dissolved oxygen.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1970s, studies {{indicated}} that active treatment {{would be the}} most suitable remedy for <b>abandoned</b> <b>mine</b> drainage in the watershed of Nanticoke Creek, with hydrated lime being proposed as one possible treatment method. However, some small scale passive treatment has been attempted in the watershed. A 2008 paper estimated that the Nanticoke Creek Assessment and Restoration Project would cost $5,000,000. An active treatment project by the Earth Conservancy began in 2012, with the intent to repair damage caused by the Askam Borehole. The Bureau of <b>Abandoned</b> <b>Mine</b> Reclamation of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has a permit to discharge stormwater into the creek during earth-moving activities involving filling in dangerous strip pits.|$|E
50|$|The Gold King Mine {{disaster}} {{brought the}} importance and danger of <b>abandoned</b> <b>mines</b> back into the public eye. Policy makers sought to formalize a process to identify, prioritize, and fund the reclamation of <b>abandoned</b> <b>mines</b> via the Hardrock Mining Reform and Reclamation Act of 2015 (HMRRA). This law would have created a fund specifically for the reclamation of <b>abandoned</b> <b>mines</b> and a new reclamation fee to be collected from current and future mining activities. The HMRRA never {{made it out of}} committee in either the House of Representatives’ Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources or the Senate’s Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. In 2016, the Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment (CDPHE) organized a $300,000 project, in conjunction with the Colorado Geological Survey, to inventory Colorado’s <b>abandoned</b> <b>mines</b> and prioritize each site’s reclamation according to current or potential environmental and human health impacts. While the intent of this project is merely to inventory the <b>abandoned</b> <b>mines,</b> the report will be a valuable asset if and when more funds become available for remediation.|$|R

50|$|The {{containment}} {{and ultimate}} clean-up of <b>abandoned</b> <b>mines</b> is a challenging problem, as interested parties comprise federal, state, and local governments, property owners, non-profit environmental organizations, and others. Many of the <b>mines</b> were <b>abandoned</b> when regulations {{did not exist}} concerning the rehabilitation of the mine’s land. Another complicating facet of acid <b>mine</b> drainage from <b>abandoned</b> <b>mines</b> is the downstream impacts, which affect myriad stakeholders. In terms of the actual locations of <b>abandoned</b> <b>mines</b> in Colorado, most are located on federally managed land, either the Department of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) or the United States Department of Agriculture’s National Forest Service (NFS). Approximately 19,000 are located on NFS land with an additional 3,400 <b>abandoned</b> <b>mines</b> on BLM land. Several existing federal programs can be tapped for funding the remediation of <b>abandoned</b> <b>mines</b> including the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) which provides money for sites designated Superfunds, and the Clean Water Act Grant Program. There is no single party responsible for the remediation of <b>abandoned</b> <b>mines.</b> Efforts have historically been funded {{by a combination of}} these available sources and coordinated by multiple agencies. One example is the Animas River Stakeholders Group, or ARSG, which comprises government agencies, citizen groups, and private entities - mostly mining corporations. This collaboration was dubbed a “pilot success” in a joint BLM and NFS report published in 2007. The subsequent Gold King Mine disaster in this very watershed illustrates the shortcomings of even the most organized efforts to mitigate environmental effects of <b>abandoned</b> <b>mines.</b>|$|R

Many scenes were filmed {{in an abandoned}} open-pit mine, where filming had to be halted one day due to a chemical leak. Permission was received to film the water pipe scenes at the Titan Missile Museum, near the mine, but the day before shooting permission was withdrawn. These scenes were filmed instead in a tunnel at the <b>abandoned</b> <b>mine.</b> New sets were often found by simply searching the mine.

5|$|Amongst the line's 27 {{substantial}} structures, {{the greatest}} engineering challenge was {{posed by the}} point where the track met the Edinburgh City Bypass. At that point, a tunnel had to be constructed under the A720 road while it had been temporarily diverted; in total, the project incorporated five new associated road schemes. Major challenges were also posed by <b>abandoned</b> <b>mine</b> shafts {{to the north of the}} route, some of which dated to the 16th century and had not been mapped. More than 200 bridges were involved in the scheme, as the route crosses the Gala Water and River Tweed nineteen times. One of the most vital bridges on the line carries the track over Hardengreen roundabout on the A7, and required extensive works throughout 2013. Other works included digging out an infilled cutting on the outskirts of Galashiels and reconstructing a nearby bridge to allow the line to pass under power lines.|$|E

5|$|Land uses in the {{watershed}} of Roaring Brook include forested land, agricultural land, and developed land such as high-density residential land and downtown commercial land. <b>Abandoned</b> <b>mine</b> land also occurs in {{the watershed}} and wetlands occur in some areas. Major roads in the stream's drainage basin include Interstate 380, Interstate 84, Pennsylvania Route 435, Pennsylvania Route 590, and Pennsylvania Route 690. Mills and forges were built along the stream in the late 1700s and early 1800s. During the 19th century, there was a substantial coal and iron industry in the watershed. Several railroads were also built in the stream's vicinity. Numerous bridges, including the Harrison Avenue Bridge (which is on the National Register of Historic Places) have been built across the stream as well.
