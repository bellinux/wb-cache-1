5|$|In Kathmandu, Nepal, {{the sorcerer}} Kaecilius and his zealots enter the secret {{compound}} Kamar-Taj and behead its librarian. They steal <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> from an ancient, mystical text {{belonging to the}} Ancient One, a long-lived sorcerer who has taught every student at Kamar-Taj, including Kaecilius, in the mystic arts. The Ancient One pursues the traitors, but Kaecilius and his followers escape.|$|E
5|$|Meyer found {{writing the}} script to be a smooth process. He would write <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pages,</b> {{show it to}} Nimoy and Bennett for consultation, and return to his office to write some more. Once Nimoy, Bennett, and Meyer were happy, they showed the script to Shatner, who offered his own notes for another round of rewrites. The {{completed}} script was shown to Paramount executives, who were very pleased.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he never}} {{abandoned}} {{the idea of}} composing a full opera, and considered many subjects– including that of the Nibelung saga later adapted by Wagner, about which he corresponded with his sister Fanny– he never wrote more than <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> of sketches for any project. In Mendelssohn's last years the opera manager Benjamin Lumley tried to contract him to write an opera from Shakespeare's The Tempest on a libretto by Eugène Scribe, and even announced it as forthcoming in 1847, the year of Mendelssohn's death. The libretto was eventually set by Fromental Halévy. At his death Mendelssohn left some sketches for an opera {{on the story of}} the Lorelei.|$|E
40|$|This PDF edition was {{produced}} in February 2004. It {{is identical to the}} 1995 printed version in content except for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minor typographical and formatting corrections. The overall pagination is the same, but <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>page</b> breaks occur at slightly different points due to a difference {{in the size of the}} font used for footnotes and quotes. <b>A</b> very <b>few</b> additional printed copies of this book are still available for $ 2...|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} a relief company, from the 1st Battalion of the Kumaon Regiment, reached Badgam, the {{position}} held by Sharma's company had been overrun. However, the 200 casualties suffered by the tribal infiltrators caused them to lose the impetus to advance. This bought time for Indian forces to fly into Srinagar airfield and block all routes of ingress to Srinagar itself. During the battle, along with Sharma, one junior commissioned officer and 20 other ranks of D company were killed. Sharma's body was recovered three days later. Though it was disfigured beyond recognition, his body was identified {{by means of the}} leather holster of his pistol and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> of Bhagavad Gita in his breast pocket.|$|E
5|$|Contemporaries {{regarded}} Organt {{as something}} of a salacious novelty and it was quickly banned, but censors who tried to confiscate it discovered that few copies were available anywhere. It did not sell well and resulted in a financial loss for its author. The public's taste for literature had changed in the prelude to the Revolution, and Saint-Just's taste changed with it: aside from <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> of an unfinished novel found amidst his papers {{at the end of his}} life, Saint-Just devoted his future writing entirely to undecorated essays of social and political theory. With his previous ambitions of literary and lawyerly fame unfulfilled, Saint-Just directed his focus on the single goal of revolutionary command.|$|E
5|$|The pair's latest book, The Body Shape Bible, was {{published}} on 18 September 2007. Through a survey about different body shapes conducted amongst women, Constantine and Woodall {{were able to}} discover the twelve most common women's body shapes. They used this information to write The Body Shape Bible which highlights these twelve shapes which have all been named in ways such as 'cornet' or 'brick'. In the fashion advice book, women can interpret which shape they are, and can then be given adequate fashion advice on their own individual shape. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> in the book are also devoted to illustrating some of Constantine and Woodall's own fashion disasters.|$|E

5|$|In another story, Stowe and Calvin {{meet a man}} on a Mandarin dock who {{has been}} cheated out of much the land he was given by the government. Named Old Cudjo, he worked the small {{homestead}} on which he grew cotton for years. Where at first the neighbors surrounding the colony of former slaves from South Carolina were hesitant and suspicious, Old Cudjo and his colony were so industrious and honest that they won their white neighbors over. One who was a justice of the peace intervened on his behalf and Old Cudjo's land was returned to him. Stowe's final chapter is dedicated to defending the notion that blacks should be employed to help build the state of Florida to transform it from a wilderness into a civilization. They are better suited for work in the hot sun, more resistant to malaria, and are trustworthy and extremely eager to learn. She also dedicates <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> to her interested observations on their culture as she details overhearing their festivities at night and sitting outside an informal church service.|$|E
5|$|Vice {{president}} of programming {{and production of}} Cartoon Network, Mike Lazzo, showed high interest in the series and requested a show bible, which came through by fax, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> at a time, {{over a period of}} the next few months. After an affirmative response from Cartoon Network president Betty Cohen, the legal paperwork and deal-making began, followed by a start-up meeting at the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles. A deal was made that Antonucci's studio, a.k.a. Cartoon, would produce Ed, Edd n Eddy, the first Cartoon Network original series to be produced by an outside production company rather than Cartoon Network's Hanna-Barbera. The series also entered production and bypassed a seven-minute short; this marked the first time that one of the studio's original series had ever done this.|$|E

25|$|Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was {{instrumental}} in securing Brandukov's success. Tchaikovsky greatly admired Brandukov's playing, and {{in the summer of}} 1887 sent <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> of the Pezzo Capriccioso to him for his opinion.

25|$|One type of {{flat tax}} would {{be imposed on}} all income once; at {{the source of the}} income. Hall and Rabushka (1995) {{includes}} a proposed amendment to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code that would implement the variant of the flat tax they advocate. This amendment, only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> long, would replace hundreds of pages of statutory language (although most statutory language in taxation statutes is not directed at specifying graduated tax rates).|$|E
25|$|A notable {{controversy}} in Canadian magazine publishing {{in recent years}} has been the existence of split run magazines, where a title published in another country, such as TIME or Sports Illustrated, is republished in Canada with <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> of special Canadian content, in order to take advantage of Canadian advertising sales revenues. The government of Canada imposed a special excise tax on split run publications in 1995 to discourage the practice, although this continues to be controversial.|$|E

25|$|Many other {{magazines}} only {{survived for}} a few years, and their best artists then joined either Spirou or Tintin. Magazines like Bimbo, Story or Wrill mainly had regional success and lacked a truly popular main series. Tillieux worked for Bimbo, Martin for Wrill, André-Paul Duchâteau started his writing career in the new version of Bravo. Petits Belges / Zonneland continued to be published, but only devoted <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> to comics.

25|$|In 1985, King {{wrote his}} first {{work for the}} comic book medium, writing <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> of the benefit X-Men comic book Heroes for Hope Starring the X-Men. The book, whose profits were donated to assist with famine relief in Africa, was written {{by a number of}} {{different}} authors in the comic book field, such as Chris Claremont, Stan Lee, and Alan Moore, as well as authors not primarily associated with that industry, such as Harlan Ellison. The following year, King wrote the introduction to Batman No. 400, an anniversary issue in which he expressed his preference for that character over Superman.|$|E
25|$|Fernand Halphen {{is known}} principally as a composer. Notably, {{he wrote a}} symphony in four parts, which debuted in Paris and in Monte-Carlo, {{as well as a}} suite for orchestra, a pantomime: Hagoseida, a ballet: Le Réveil du faune, and several other symphonies and melodies. He was also {{interested}} in chamber music, and wrote a Sonata for violin and piano, and composed <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> for organ. Finally, he was the author of an opera of one act: Le Cor Fleuri (féerie lyrique, with libretto by Ephraïm Mikhael and André-Ferdinand Hérold), which debuted in the national theatre Opéra-Comique 10 May 1904.|$|E

50|$|The {{underlying}} {{legislation for}} the FEHB program is minimal and remarkably stable, particularly {{in comparison to}} Medicare. The FEHB statute is only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> dozen <b>pages</b> long, and only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> paragraphs are devoted to the structure and functioning of the program. Regulations are minimal; only another <b>few</b> dozen <b>pages.</b> In contrast, the Medicare statute found in title 18 of the Social Security Act is about 400 pages long and the accompanying regulations consume thousands of pages in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations.|$|R
25|$|Bradman {{spent much}} of his solitary time on the tour writing as he had sold the rights to a book. Serialised in London's The Star during August, Don Bradman's Book was {{published}} in November 1930. It was a modest work of 50,000 words with <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> of tips as an appendix. The Board of Control ruled that the serialised extracts of his book were a technical breach of his tour contract, which banned players from writing about the game. The dispute was widely covered by the press, most of which was supportive of Bradman. However, he was fined £50 for the misdemeanour on 29 December 1930.|$|E
25|$|This story arc {{concentrates}} on the last days and death of Oscar Wilde (who is attended to by his trusted companion Robbie Ross) rather than on Cerebus himself, who appears in only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pages.</b> (The title refers to the gothic novel Melmoth the Wanderer by Charles Robert Maturin, a relative of Wilde's. Wilde adopted this alias {{during this period of}} his life.) Meanwhile, a catatonic Cerebus, believing Jaka to be dead, spends his days mourning on the patio of a café. In the last few pages of the story, after the main action had concluded, Cerebus overhears a conversation by two Cirinist jailers insulting Jaka. Enraged, Cerebus murders one of the guards and then springs into action.|$|E
25|$|Peirce was {{a working}} {{scientist}} for 30 years, and arguably {{was a professional}} philosopher only during the five years he lectured at Johns Hopkins. He learned philosophy mainly by reading, each day, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>pages</b> of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, in the original German, while a Harvard undergraduate. His writings bear on {{a wide array of}} disciplines, including mathematics, logic, philosophy, statistics, astronomy, metrology, geodesy, experimental psychology, economics, linguistics, and the history and philosophy of science. This work has enjoyed renewed interest and approval, a revival inspired not only by his anticipations of recent scientific developments but also by his demonstration of how philosophy can be applied effectively to human problems.|$|E
