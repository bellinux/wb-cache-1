5|$|Damage from Hypera postica, the <b>alfalfa</b> weevil, {{a serious}} {{introduced}} pest of forage, was substantially {{reduced by the}} introduction of natural enemies. 20 years after their introduction the population of weevils in the <b>alfalfa</b> area treated for <b>alfalfa</b> weevil in the Northeastern United States remained 75 percent down.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs {{benefit from}} feeding on fresh grass hay, such as timothy hay, in {{addition}} to food pellets which are often based from timothy. <b>Alfalfa</b> is also a popular food choice; most guinea pigs will eat large amounts of <b>alfalfa</b> when offered it, though some controversy exists over the feeding of <b>alfalfa</b> to adult guinea pigs. Some pet owners and veterinary organizations have advised that, as a legume rather than a grass hay, <b>alfalfa</b> consumed in large amounts may lead to obesity, as well as bladder stones due to excess calcium, in any but pregnant and very young guinea pigs. However, published scientific sources mention <b>alfalfa</b> {{as a source for}} replenishment of protein, amino acids, and fiber.|$|E
5|$|Animal-sourced foods (meat, fish, shellfish, fowl, eggs, dairy) provide zinc. The {{concentration}} of zinc in plants {{varies with the}} level in the soil. With adequate zinc in the soil, the food plants that contain the most zinc are wheat (germ and bran) and various seeds (sesame, poppy, <b>alfalfa,</b> celery, mustard). Zinc {{is also found in}} beans, nuts, almonds, whole grains, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and blackcurrant. Plant phytates interfere with zinc absorption, so people consuming a vegetarian or vegan diet may need to increase zinc intake.|$|E
5|$|SH-58 {{continues}} north, meeting US-60 again near Ringwood. It {{then has}} a brief concurrency with State Highway 45 near Helena. Near Jet, it overlaps U.S. Highway 64 and SH-8. North of Cherokee, the <b>Alfalfa</b> County seat, US-64 splits off and State Highway 11 joins the three-route concurrency. North of Driftwood, SH-58 splits off {{on its own}} and passes through Byron and Amorita. It terminates at the Kansas state line, where it becomes a county road.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{are largely}} grazing herbivores, unlike {{browsing}} {{animals such as}} goats and deer that prefer taller foliage. With a much narrower face, sheep crop plants {{very close to the}} ground and can overgraze a pasture much faster than cattle. For this reason, many shepherds use managed intensive rotational grazing, where a flock is rotated through multiple pastures, giving plants time to recover. Paradoxically, sheep can both cause and solve the spread of invasive plant species. By disturbing the natural state of pasture, sheep and other livestock can pave the way for invasive plants. However, sheep also prefer to eat invasives such as cheatgrass, leafy spurge, kudzu and spotted knapweed over native species such as sagebrush, making grazing sheep effective for conservation grazing. Research conducted in Imperial County, California compared lamb grazing with herbicides for weed control in seedling <b>alfalfa</b> fields. Three trials demonstrated that grazing lambs were just as effective as herbicides in controlling winter weeds. Entomologists also compared grazing lambs to insecticides for insect control in winter <b>alfalfa.</b> In this trial, lambs provided insect control as effectively as insecticides.|$|E
5|$|Legumes such as clover or <b>alfalfa</b> {{are usually}} higher in protein, calcium, and energy than grasses. However, they require warm weather and good soil {{to produce the}} best nutrients. Legume hays are {{generally}} higher in protein than the grass hays. They are also higher in minerals, particularly calcium, but have an incorrect ratio of calcium to phosphorus. Because they are high in protein, they are very desirable for growing horses or those subjected to very hard work, but the calcium:phosphorus ratio must be balanced by other feeds to prevent bone abnormalities.|$|E
5|$|The clay-rich Willamette Valley {{soils are}} {{hard in the}} dry season, and the gopher's protuberant incisors are well adapted to these conditions. Adequate soil {{drainage}} and suitable plant food are essential components of the gopher's ideal habitat. Not typically found in wetland areas (where its tunnels would flood), the species is found in seral communities of grasses and shrubs. They are also established in agricultural fields in the Willamette Valley, including fields of <b>alfalfa,</b> wheat and oats. The species has also been found in areas of ecological disturbance with similar terrain features.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} {{originally}} described in 1805 as Lycoperdon corium {{in the second}} volume of Augustin Pyramus de Candolle and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's Flore Française. They attributed authorship to French botanist Louis Ben Guersent, who discovered it in an <b>alfalfa</b> field between the town of La Sotte and Rouen in northern France. Synonyms include Scleroderma corium published by Arthur Harmount Graves in 1830, and Steerbekia corium published by Elias Magnus Fries in 1849. The species was given its current name by Nicaise Auguste Desvaux in 1842, who circumscribed the genus Mycenastrum to contain it. Generic synonyms are Vassiliĭ Matveievitch Czernajew's 1845 Endonevrum and Stephan Schulzer von Müggenburg's 1876 Pachyderma.|$|E
5|$|Camas pocket gophers cause {{significant}} economic losses, so may {{be treated as}} an agricultural pest. Crops damaged include clover, <b>alfalfa</b> and vetch. The gophers may eat these crops or damage the roots while burrowing. This can injure the roots and expose them to air, causing them to dry out. Subterranean activity can also damage the roots of fruit trees. Root crops are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption; potatoes, carrots, parsnips and other crops may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow. Excavated soil can cover grass and limit lifestock grazing; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged. An estimate of impact from camas pocket gopher activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $1.5million annual losses. Gopher activities can provide a benefit of soil aeration, enhancing water retention after rain or snowmelt. Buried vegetation can also compost, enhancing organic soil content to provide additional benefits.|$|E
5|$|During the 5th and 6th century many Sogdians took up {{residence}} in the Hexi Corridor where they retained autonomy in terms of governance and had a designated official administrator known as a sabao, which suggests their importance to the socioeconomic structure of China. The Sogdian influence on trade in China is also made apparent by a Chinese document which lists taxes paid on caravan trade in the Turpan region and shows that twenty-nine out of the thirty-five commercial transactions involved Sogdian merchants, and in thirteen of those cases both the buyer and the seller were Sogdian. Trade goods brought to China included grapes, <b>alfalfa,</b> and Sassanian silverware, as well as glass containers, Mediterranean coral, brass Buddhist images, Roman wool cloth, and Baltic amber. These were exchanged for Chinese paper, copper, and silk. In the 7th century the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang noted with approval that Sogdian boys were taught {{to read and write}} at the age of five, though their skill was turned to trade, disappointing the scholarly Xuanzang. He also recorded the Sogdians working in other capacities such as farmers, carpetweavers, glassmakers, and woodcarvers.|$|E
5|$|Strict Jains don't eat root {{vegetables}} such as potatoes, onions, roots and tubers. This is so because tiny life forms are injured when {{the plant is}} pulled up and because the bulb {{is seen as a}} living being, as it is able to sprout. Also, consumption of most {{root vegetables}} involves uprooting and killing the entire plant, in contrast to consumption of most other terrestrial vegetables, upon which the plant lives on after plucking the vegetables (or it was seasonally supposed to wither away anyway). Mushrooms, fungi and yeasts are forbidden because they are parasites, grow in non-hygienic environments, and may harbour other life forms. <b>Alfalfa</b> is the only known plant that contains vitamin D2, which they may use directly or make vitamin D2 supplements from. Honey is forbidden, as its collection would amount to violence against the bees.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Dawson Creek {{is based on}} four major industries: agriculture, retail, tourism, and oil and gas. Agriculture has {{historically}} been the most important industry to Dawson Creek, as the city is the regional transshipment point for agricultural commodities. The city is surrounded by the Agricultural Land Reserve, where the soil can support livestock and produces consistently good yields of quality grain and grass crops, such as canola, hay, oats, <b>alfalfa,</b> wheat, and sweet clover. The service and retail sector caters to the city's inhabitants, smaller nearby towns, and rural communities. However, there is significant retail leakage to Grande Prairie, the closest major Alberta city, {{where there is no}} provincial tax on retail purchases, while British Columbia charges 7%. In 2006, the BC government rejected a proposal to lower the sales tax in the province's border communities to 4%. The problem of leakage has been exacerbated in recent years by the introduction of large-format retail stores into the small city. Residents still cross the border for high-priced items but now also purchase medium- and low-priced items from foreign-owned large-format chain stores.|$|E
5|$|Yellow-bellied marmots are diurnal, and {{are less}} active during the night. They are omnivores, but {{generally}} eat {{a wide variety of}} plants, as they are generalist herbivores.They mostly feed on grass, grains, leaves, flowers, legumes, bird eggs, and insects. Occasionally, they are also known to eat fruits and bark of fruit trees. In food choice experiments, yellow-bellied marmots are known to reject plants containing defensive compounds. Due to this, they consume flowers of lupinus, larkspur, and columbine, but avoid their shoots containing toxic compounds. Their food choice depends upon the fatty acid and protein concentrations, which are well present in cinquefoil, cow-parsnip, and leaves of dandelion, which are also present in their diet. In late summer, however, grasses, forbs, and seeds make up most of their diet. They also like to feed on <b>alfalfa</b> and clover. They drink less water, as their plant diet mostly serves their water requirements.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, the cotton {{industry}} was booming. The crop made up 69% of the agricultural business in the region. Livestock production was booming, as was poultry production, especially chicken. In addition, the shipping of agricultural goods and livestock was the other main business in Cooper. The First National Bank was rebuilt in 1909 and became an important factor in Cooper's economy. In the 1910s, potatoes become {{an important part of the}} economy due to the sudden drop in the livestock business. In 1926, the cotton crop failed and Cooper's economy plummeted. Many of Cooper's inhabitants became deep in debt as the price of crops plummeted. The lumber businesses had exhausted the regions resources, forcing most of them to go out of business. Many people moved away to find new work. The local economy stabilized in the mid-1930s, and cotton, potato, and corn production began to rise. The growing of oats, however, had ended. In addition, the railroad going through Cooper had failed a few years before, so the shipping industry in Cooper was struggling. Cotton and <b>alfalfa</b> carried Cooper's economy through the 1950s and 1960s, until the shift to the growing of wheat in the 1970s. Cooper reported 60 businesses in the 1970s, more than half of which were dairies. During the 1980s and 1990s, Cooper's economy shifted to the manufacturing and shipping of local goods, and in 1991, Cooper had 70 businesses.|$|E
25|$|In the 16th century, Spanish colonizers {{introduced}} <b>alfalfa</b> to the Americas as {{fodder for}} their horses. They {{were aware that}} <b>alfalfa</b> is better than grass as food for working horses (<b>alfalfa</b> had more energy).|$|E
25|$|<b>Alfalfa</b> {{leaves are}} POSSIBLY SAFE for most adults. However, taking <b>alfalfa</b> seeds {{long-term}} is LIKELY UNSAFE. <b>Alfalfa</b> seed products may cause reactions {{that are similar}} to the autoimmune disease called lupus erythematosus.|$|E
25|$|Its {{primary use}} is as feed for high-producing dairy cows, {{because of its}} high protein content and highly {{digestible}} fiber, and secondarily for beef cattle, horses, sheep, and goats. <b>Alfalfa</b> hay is a widely used protein and fiber source for meat rabbits. In poultry diets, dehydrated <b>alfalfa</b> and <b>alfalfa</b> leaf concentrates are used for pigmenting eggs and meat, because of their high content in carotenoids, which are efficient for colouring egg yolk and body lipids. Humans also eat <b>alfalfa</b> sprouts in salads and sandwiches. Dehydrated <b>alfalfa</b> leaf is commercially available as a dietary supplement in several forms, such as tablets, powders and tea. Fresh <b>alfalfa</b> can cause bloating in livestock, so {{care must be taken}} with livestock grazing on <b>alfalfa</b> because of this hazard.|$|E
25|$|This plant {{exhibits}} autotoxicity, {{which means}} {{it is difficult for}} <b>alfalfa</b> seed to grow in existing stands of <b>alfalfa.</b> Therefore, <b>alfalfa</b> fields are recommended to be rotated with other species (for example, corn or wheat) before reseeding.|$|E
25|$|Today, the <b>alfalfa</b> leafcutter bee is {{increasingly}} used to circumvent these problems. As a solitary but gregarious bee species, {{it does not}} build colonies or store honey, but is a very efficient pollinator of <b>alfalfa</b> flowers. Nesting is in individual tunnels in wooden or plastic material, supplied by the <b>alfalfa</b> seed growers. The leafcutter bees {{are used in the}} Pacific Northwest, while western honeybees dominate in California <b>alfalfa</b> seed production.|$|E
25|$|Estrogens – Large {{amounts of}} <b>alfalfa</b> {{might have some}} of the same effects as {{estrogen}}. However even large amounts of <b>alfalfa</b> are not as strong as estrogen pills. Taking <b>alfalfa</b> along with estrogen pills might decrease the effects of estrogen pills.|$|E
25|$|Roundup Ready <b>alfalfa,</b> {{a genetically}} {{modified}} variety, {{was released by}} Forage Genetics International in 2005. This was developed through the insertion of a gene owned by Monsanto Company that confers resistance to glyphosate, a broad-spectrum herbicide, also known as Roundup. Although most grassy and broadleaf plants, including ordinary <b>alfalfa,</b> are killed by Roundup; growers can spray fields of Roundup Ready <b>alfalfa</b> with the glyphosate herbicide and kill the weeds without harming the <b>alfalfa</b> crop.|$|E
25|$|<b>Alfalfa</b> seed {{production}} requires {{the presence of}} pollinators when the fields of <b>alfalfa</b> are in bloom. <b>Alfalfa</b> pollination is somewhat problematic, however, because western honey bees, {{the most commonly used}} pollinator, are less than ideal for this purpose; the pollen-carrying keel of the <b>alfalfa</b> flower trips and strikes pollinating bees on the head, which helps transfer the pollen to the foraging bee. Western honey bees, however, do not like being struck in the head repeatedly and learn to defeat this action by drawing nectar {{from the side of the}} flower. The bees thus collect the nectar, but carry no pollen, so do not pollinate the next flower they visit. Because older, experienced bees do not pollinate <b>alfalfa</b> well, most pollination is accomplished by young bees that have not yet learned the trick of robbing the flower without tripping the head-knocking keel. When western honey bees are used to pollinate <b>alfalfa,</b> the beekeeper stocks the field at a very high rate to maximize the number of young bees.|$|E
25|$|Megachile rotundata {{is another}} species that pollinates the <b>alfalfa</b> plant. M. rotundata was unintentionally {{introduced}} into the United States during the 1940s, and its management as a pollinator of <b>alfalfa</b> {{has led to a}} three-fold increase in seed production in the U.S. The synchronous emergence of the adult bees of this species during <b>alfalfa</b> blooming period in combination with such behaviors as gregarious nesting, and utilization of leaves and nesting materials that have been mass-produced by humans provide positive benefits for the use of these bees in pollinating <b>alfalfa.</b>|$|E
25|$|When used as feed for dairy cattle, <b>alfalfa</b> {{is often}} made into haylage {{by a process}} known as ensiling. Rather than being dried to make dry hay, the <b>alfalfa</b> is chopped finely and {{fermented}} in silos, trenches, or bags, where the oxygen supply can be limited to promote fermentation. The anaerobic fermentation of <b>alfalfa</b> allows it to retain high nutrient levels similar to those of fresh forage, and is also more palatable to dairy cattle than dry hay. In many cases, <b>alfalfa</b> silage is inoculated with different strains of microorganisms to improve the fermentation quality and aerobic stability of the silage.|$|E
25|$|The {{brothers}} {{first appeared}} in the 1935 Our Gang short Beginner's Luck. By the end of the year, <b>Alfalfa</b> {{was one of the main}} characters, while Harold had been relegated to the background. Although Carl was an experienced singer and musician, his character <b>Alfalfa</b> was often called upon to sing off-key renditions of popular songs, most often those of Bing Crosby. <b>Alfalfa</b> also sported a cowlick.|$|E
25|$|<b>Alfalfa,</b> {{like other}} leguminous crops, is a known source of phytoestrogens, {{including}} spinasterol, coumestrol, and coumestan. Because of this, grazing on <b>alfalfa</b> has caused reduced fertility in sheep and in dairy cattle.|$|E
25|$|Raw <b>alfalfa</b> {{seeds and}} sprouts {{are a source}} of the amino acid canavanine. Much of the canavanine is {{converted}} into other amino acids during germination so sprouts contain much less canavanine than unsprouted seeds. Canavanine competes with arginine, resulting in the synthesis of dysfunctional proteins. Raw unsprouted <b>alfalfa</b> has toxic effects in primates, including humans, which can result in lupus-like symptoms and other immunological diseases in susceptible individuals, and sprouts also produced these symptoms in at least some primates when fed a diet made of 40% <b>alfalfa.</b> Stopping consumption of <b>alfalfa</b> seeds can reverse the effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Alfalfa</b> is {{considered}} an insectary, a place where insects are reared, and has been proposed as helpful to other crops, such as cotton, if the two are interplanted, because the <b>alfalfa</b> harbours predatory and parasitic insects that would protect the other crop. Harvesting the <b>alfalfa</b> by mowing the entire crop area destroys the insect population, but this can be avoided by mowing in strips so {{that part of the}} growth remains.|$|E
25|$|<b>Alfalfa</b> {{is rich in}} chlorophyll, carotene, protein, {{calcium and}} other minerals, {{vitamins}} in the B group, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K. The sun-dried hay of <b>alfalfa</b> {{has been found to}} be a source of vitamin D, containing 48ng/g (1920 IU/kg) vitamin D2 and 0.63ng/g (25 IU/kg) vitamin D3. There is reference to vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 being found in the <b>alfalfa</b> shoot; this is awaiting verification.|$|E
25|$|Some pests, {{such as the}} <b>alfalfa</b> weevil, aphids, armyworms, and {{the potato}} leafhopper, can reduce <b>alfalfa</b> yields dramatically, {{particularly}} with the second cutting when weather is warmest. Registered insecticides or chemical controls are sometimes used to prevent this and labels will specify the withholding period before the forage crop can be grazed or cut for hay or silage. <b>Alfalfa</b> is also susceptible to root rots, including Phytophthora, Rhizoctonia, and Texas root rot.|$|E
25|$|When <b>alfalfa</b> {{is to be}} used as hay, it {{is usually}} cut and baled. Loose haystacks are still used in some areas, but bales are easier for use in transportation, storage, and feed. Ideally, the first cutting should be taken at the bud stage, and the {{subsequent}} cuttings just as the field is beginning to flower, or one-tenth bloom because carbohydrates are at their highest. When using farm equipment rather than hand-harvesting, a swather cuts the <b>alfalfa</b> and arranges it in windrows. In areas where the <b>alfalfa</b> does not immediately dry out on its own, a machine known as a mower-conditioner is used to cut the hay. The mower-conditioner has a set of rollers or flails that crimp and break the stems as they pass through the mower, making the <b>alfalfa</b> dry faster. After the <b>alfalfa</b> has dried, a tractor pulling a baler collects the hay into bales.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>alfalfa</b> cultivars contain genetic {{material}} from sickle medick (M. falcata), a crop wild relative of <b>alfalfa</b> that naturally hybridizes with M. sativa to produce sand lucerne (M. sativa ssp. varia). This species may bear either the purple flowers of <b>alfalfa</b> or the yellow of sickle medick, {{and is so}} called for its ready growth in sandy soil. Traits for insect resistance have also been introduced from M. glomerata and M. prostrata, members of alfalfa's secondary gene pool.|$|E
25|$|Pregnancy or breast-feeding: Using <b>alfalfa</b> in amounts {{larger than}} what is {{commonly}} found in food is possibly unsafe during pregnancy and breast-feeding. There {{is some evidence that}} <b>alfalfa</b> may act like estrogen, and this might affect the pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Alfalfa</b> {{is widely}} grown {{throughout}} the world as forage for cattle, and is most often harvested as hay, but can also be made into silage, grazed, or fed as greenchop. <b>Alfalfa</b> usually has the highest feeding value of all common hay crops. It is used less frequently as pasture. When grown on soils where it is well-adapted, <b>alfalfa</b> is often the highest-yielding forage plant, but its primary benefit is the combination of high yield per hectare and high nutritional quality.|$|E
25|$|Diabetes: <b>Alfalfa</b> might {{lower blood}} sugar levels.|$|E
25|$|Kidney {{transplant}}: There is {{one report}} of a kidney transplant rejection following the three-month use of a supplement that contained <b>alfalfa</b> and black cohosh. This outcome is more likely due to <b>alfalfa</b> than black cohosh. Alfalfa's immune system boost might make the anti-rejection drug cyclosporine less effective.|$|E
