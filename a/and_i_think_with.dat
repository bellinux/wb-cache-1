500|$|The poem {{was praised}} for its {{universal}} aspects, and Gray {{became one of}} the most famous English poets of his era. Despite this, after his death only his elegy remained popular until 20th-century critics began to re-evaluate his poetry. The 18th-century writer James Beattie was said by Sir William Forbes, 6th Baronet to have written a letter to him claiming, [...] "Of all the English poets of this age, Mr. Gray is most admired, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>with</b> justice; yet there are comparatively speaking but a few who know of anything of his, but his 'Church-yard Elegy,' which is by no means the best of his works." ...|$|E
500|$|With the {{introduction}} of Jason Wilkes and Frost, both considered [...] "outsiders" [...] as Carter {{was in the first}} season, co-showrunner Chris Dingess noted how their arcs in the season would be similar, yet different to Carter's, saying [...] "I think everyone, to get to that place of getting respect, has a different road to get there. Everyone makes different choices along the way that define that road <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>with</b> these three characters, everyone has a distinct, separate path." [...] Atwell spoke specifically about the season's approach to diversity and prejudice, and noted that the series' crew had expanded to include African American and Asian writers as well as a female director. [...] "Since the first season heavily focused on a woman in a man's world," [...] Atwell said, [...] "we're now going into more diversity and we're investigating different prejudices within this time and one of them absolutely would have been race, as we all know....if you have a staunchly white male cast then it might be more accurate of the time, but it becomes less relatable to our audiences, especially when the Marvel world's so diverse." [...] On the racism issue, Butters stated, [...] "We didn't want to just have an African-American character and not talk about that. That would have been very inauthentic." [...] As for the sexism Frost faces, Gina McIntrye and Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly saw similarities with Marvel's Jessica Jones when Frost is asked to smile by two different men in her flashbacks in [...] "Smoke & Mirrors". Towers said, [...] "The talent agent [...] may not be the Purple Man, but Whitney is certainly being ushered into a brainwashed mindset that will set her on a path she can't deviate from easily." ...|$|E
60|$|Before {{replying}} {{he surveyed}} me with surprise <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>with</b> instinctive suspicion of {{my clothes and}} bearing.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no. Not important, {{but very}} pleasant. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{acquaintance}} <b>with</b> such a girl {{would give you}} some new ideas of women." ...|$|R
6000|$|I've lived, as {{many others}} live, [...] <b>And</b> yet, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>with</b> more enjoyment; [...] For could I through my days again live, [...] I'd pass {{them in the}} 'same' employment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but I {{seem to feel}} I {{know what}} he <b>thinks.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> should <b>think,</b> <b>with</b> {{all the time you}} spent with him, you'd know it," [...] she said, [...] "yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|But what I deplore still more, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>with</b> reason, is {{the total}} {{omission}} of the familiar interrogation: [...] "What is your impression of our women?" ...|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR FATHER,--Heh! Heh! {{business}} letter finished. Receipt acknowledged {{without much}} ado, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>with</b> a certain commercial decision and brevity. The signature is good but not original.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] Ronald said, [...] "but {{when one}} knows one, he soon gets well {{at home in}} the other. At any rate, for simple work the system is exactly the same, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>with</b> two or three drills I shall be able to keep my place." ...|$|E
60|$|Cort. 'Tis true I loved, {{but she is}} dead, she's dead; <b>And</b> <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>with</b> her all beauty fled, Did not her fair {{resemblance}} live in you, And, by that image, {{my first}} flames renew.|$|R
6000|$|... "It’s just {{a little}} bit ’o bisness we ’appened to drop on,’ ses Sam, at last, ’me an’ Peter, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that, <b>with</b> luck <b>and</b> management, we’re in a fair way to make our fortunes. Peter, ’ere, ain’t given to looking on the cheerful side o’ things, but ’e thinks so, too.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but {{in point}} of {{companionship}} one would prefer {{that she should be}} represented by her brandy-cherries <b>and</b> cream-cakes. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>with</b> a shudder that her daughter will always be present in person, and have no agreeable proxies of that kind,--a fat, blond girl, with round blue eyes, who will stare at us silently." ...|$|R
6000|$|... he replied, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>with</b> exact judgment, {{that when}} Jupiter gave Juno leave to {{withdraw}} Turnus {{from the present}} danger, {{it was because he}} certainly foreknew that his fatal hour was not come, that it was in destiny for Juno at that time to save him, and that himself obeyed destiny in giving her that leave.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is good {{as well as}} evil in this," [...] he whispered. [...] "I {{now know}} our precise position; and, God be praised! the inlet is near, could we but reach it.--By a strong shove we can always force the launch from the vessel's side, and prevent their {{boarding}} us; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>with</b> extreme caution, we may even haul the boat past the ship undetected." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{hospitality}} of England {{has become}} {{famous in the}} world, <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>with</b> reason. I doubt not there is just as much hospitable feeling in other countries; but in England the matter of coziness and home comfort has been so studied, and matured, and reduced to system, that they really have it {{in their power to}} effect more, towards making their guests comfortable, than perhaps any other people.|$|E
5000|$|Tim Rogers {{later said}} of the album, [...] "We just wanted 3-minute songs about being in love and rooting and loving being in a rock 'n' roll band <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{everyone}} associated <b>with</b> us absolutely hates it." ...|$|R
60|$|The Venetians desire now, {{and first}} of all things, Liberty, knowing that in slavery men can learn no virtues; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> them fit, <b>with</b> all their errors and defects, to be free now, because men are never fit to be slaves.|$|R
5000|$|Francis Darwin {{described}} it as characteristic that his father delighted in the observations that preceded the publication of Fertilisation of Orchids, not the applause which followed it. He quoted one of his father's last letters about orchids, written in 1880: They are wonderful creatures, these Orchids, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> sometimes <b>think</b> <b>with</b> a glow of pleasure, when I remember making out some little point in their method of fertilisation.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Yeobright {{shook her}} head. [...] "Thomasin thinks, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>with</b> her, that {{she ought to}} be Wildeve's wife, if she means to appear before the world without a slur upon her name. If they marry soon, {{everybody}} will believe that an accident did really prevent the wedding. If not, it may cast a shade upon her character--at any rate make her ridiculous. In short, if it is anyhow possible they must marry now." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{political}} {{officer was}} firm, and his terms were explicit. Either they must {{give up the}} twenty-two rifles captured from the 35th Sikhs, on the 16th, or their villages would be destroyed. No other terms would he accept. To this they replied, {{that they had not}} got the rifles. They had all been taken, they said, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>with</b> truth, by the Afghan tribesmen from the Kunar Valley. These would not give them up. Besides--this also with truth--they had been taken in [...] "fair war." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No; and the Greeks {{have been}} enslaved and oppressed {{for a great}} many years, and that is apt to make people get cowardly and false. But that is not our concern, Val, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>with</b> such a {{recollection}} of her good father, and such a sister to help her, Maura will not fall into the fault again. And, my dear, I quite see that neither you nor she entirely realised that what you did was deception, though you never spoke a word of untruth.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All now {{depends on}} our canvas," [...] said the admiral, with a sigh; [...] "if that stand, we are safer than when scudding, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> God is <b>with</b> us. To me it seemeth {{as if the}} wind was a little less violent than in the night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here is a telescope," [...] Cathelineau said. [...] "We {{are well}} {{provided}} with them, as we took {{all that we}} could find, at Chollet <b>and</b> Vihiers. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that, <b>with</b> its aid, {{you will be able}} to have a good view of what is going on." ...|$|R
6000|$|Hilda Wade, with {{infinite}} sisterly tenderness, led {{her over}} to a chair by {{the window in the}} summer twilight, and took one quivering hand in hers. [...] "I have been telling Dr. Cumberledge, Lina, about what I most fear for your dear brother, darling; <b>and...</b> <b>I</b> <b>think...</b> he agrees <b>with</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{shall have}} a scene here to-night, no doubt. The night before last, Ballantyne, {{unable to get}} in, had a seat behind the screen, and was nearly frightened off it by the [...] "Murder." [...] Every vestige of colour had left his face when I came off, and he sat staring over a glass of {{champagne}} in the wildest way. I have utterly left off my champagne, <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>with</b> good results. Nothing during the readings but a very little weak iced brandy-and-water.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{will say}} it, husband, {{though it is}} but my guess, for I have had no words with Foy or Martin, and if I am wrong they can correct me. I know their faces, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>with</b> you {{that they are not}} {{speaking}} the truth. I think that they do not wish us to know it--not that they may keep the secret of this treasure for themselves, but because such a secret might well bring those who know of it to the torment and the stake. Is it not so, my son?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Hiram Powlett was Captain Mervyn's {{champion}} in the snuggery. It was true he had few arguments to adduce in favour of his belief, and he allowed the smith and Reuben Claphurst to do {{the greater part of}} the talking, while he smoked his pipe silently, always winding up the discussion by saying: [...] "Well, neighbours, I can't do {{much in the way of}} arguing, and I allow that what you say is right enough, but for all that I believe Captain Mervyn to be innocent. My daughter Ruth won't hear a word said as to his being guilty, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>with</b> her." ...|$|E
6000|$|I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by {{dwelling}} on these preliminary circumstances; {{but they were}} days of comparative happiness, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of them <b>with</b> pleasure. My country, my beloved country! who but a native can tell the delight I took in again beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely lake! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Right, right," [...] exclaimed the Antiquary. [...] "Fall in my opinion!--not a whit--I love thee the better, man;--why, we have {{story for}} story against each other, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can <b>think</b> <b>with</b> less shame on having exposed myself about that cursed Praetorium--though I am still {{convinced}} Agricola's camp {{must have been}} somewhere in this neighbourhood. And now, Lovel, my good lad, be sincere with me--What make you from Wittenberg?--why have you left your own country and professional pursuits, for an idle residence {{in such a place}} as Fairport? A truant disposition, I fear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's my business, John. I'm {{going to}} hold this place till the {{soldiers}} come; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>with</b> twenty pounds of steam in the boiler, <b>and</b> the hose, <b>I</b> can keep all the miners of Stokebridge out. At any rate, I'll try. Now, John, set to work. I want thee to go straight home, and then no one will suspect thee of having {{a hand in the}} matter. I'll go out when thou dost, and thou canst swear, if thou art asked, that there was not a soul in the house when thou camest away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As for the gayety, I am sure I {{shall not}} regret it, Captain Doolan; besides, our gayeties are pretty well over, except, of course, dinner parties, {{and it is}} getting very hot for them. We shall get off having {{to go out in}} the heat of the day to make calls, which seem to me terrible afflictions, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>with</b> a small party it ought to be very sociable and pleasant. As for excitement, I hear that there is much better {{shooting}} there than there is here. Mrs. Hunter was telling me that they have had some tigers that have been very troublesome round there, and you will all have an opportunity of showing your skill and bravery. I know that Mr. Richards and Mr. Wilson are burning to distinguish themselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We can cut off {{the tops}} of the trees and then bind in some of the {{branches}} for a roof," [...] said Snap. [...] "Over those branches we can bind others, with strips of bark between. We can cut the trees higher {{on one side of the}} circle than on the other, so the snow and rain can run off. Then we can bind in brushwood and bark for the sides, between the trees, leaving one spot open for a rough sort of chimney, which we'll have to build up of flat rocks. It won't make as nice a cabin as the other was, but it is the best we can do in this wintry weather, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>with</b> a good fire going, we can make it fairly comfortable inside." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid I shall always worry myself about it," [...] replied Valentine seriously. [...] "Whenever I see you, my good friend, I fancy I {{hear all}} that melancholy story over again about our darling child, and that poor lost forsaken mother of hers, whose name even we don't know. I feel, too, {{when you come}} and see us, almost more than at other times, how inexpressibly {{precious}} the daughter whom you have given to us is to Lavvie and me; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>with</b> more dread than I well know how to describe, of the horrible chance, if anything was incautiously said, and carried from mouth to mouth--about where you met with her mother, for instance, or what {{time of the year}} it was, and so forth--that it might lead, nobody knows how, to some claim being laid to her, by somebody who might be able to prove the right to make it." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> always <b>think</b> that my {{strength}} is ... sculpting stuff up in post-production and then, {{a lot of}} the time things are pretty ramshackle while they're shot. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>with</b> the video that was the most extreme example of that, I mean it really was a disaster ... In the Avid, looking at this stuff, it just looked awful <b>and</b> <b>I</b> actually had a panic attack when I went to the telecine to look at the rushes. I just thought [...] "this is a fucking disaster, ... so cheap and nasty. At it was only when Glassworks started doing the computer graphics that ... I started to realise how the video was gonna be made completely with the computer graphic addition.|$|R
5000|$|Felsch later said, as {{quoted by}} the Chicago American:"Well, the beans are spilled <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I'm through <b>with</b> baseball. I got $5,000. I {{could have got}} just about that much by being on the level if the Sox had won the Series. And now I'm out of baseball—the only {{profession}} I know anything about, {{and a lot of}} gamblers have gotten rich. The joke seems to be on us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{fear for}} me, father," [...] said Mary, gravely meeting her father's eyes; [...] "Fred {{has always been}} very good to me; he is kind-hearted and affectionate, <b>and</b> not false, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>with</b> all his self-indulgence. But I will never engage myself to one who has no manly independence, and who goes on {{loitering}} away his time on the chance that others will provide for him. You and my mother have taught me too much pride for that." ...|$|R
