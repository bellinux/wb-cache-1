40|$|Background-—Our {{objectives}} were to characterize functional {{and structural features}} of an experimental model of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and its response to beta-blockers. Methods and Results-—In protocol 1, a dose-finding study: 69 rats received various doses of isoproterenol (ISO) and echocardiographic and histologic parameters were measured on days 2 to 3 or day 8. There were no dose-dependent effects and, out of 69 ISO-treated rats, 40 (58. 0 %) survived and 29 (42. 0 %) died within 24 hours. Of survivors, 30 had apical <b>akinesis</b> averaging 12. 11. 6 % of the long axis LV circumference. Out of the 40 survivors, 32. 5 % showed apical <b>akinesis</b> ≥ 10 %, 42. 5 % showed akinesis< 10 % and 25 % showed no apical <b>akinesis.</b> The basal portion of the LV was always preserved. At 24 hours, histology and ultrastructure showed necrosis, vacuolization, lipid droplets, mononuclear cell infiltration, damaged mitochondria, and edema. On day 8, apical <b>akinesis</b> fully resolved but histologic abnormalities were still present. In protocol 2, rats were randomized to Control; ISO 100 mg/kg; propranolol+ISO; and metoprolol+ISO groups. Pretreatment with propranolol and metoprolol improved survival to 90 % and 100 % respectively, compared with 60 % in the ISO group, but did not reduce the incidence and extent of <b>akinesis</b> or the structural damage. Conclusion-—TC can be mimicked in a rat model of ISO exposure that demonstrates apical <b>akinesis</b> on days 2 to 3 with full recovery of systolic regional wall motion abnormality {{despite the presence of}} persistent foci of necrosis and fibrosis on day 8. Pretreatment with beta-blockers improved survival but did not affect structural and functional alterations. (J Am Heart Assoc...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY To {{assess the}} {{accuracy}} of phased-array two-dimensional echocardiography in detecting, localizing and quantifying myocardial injury in man, the relationship of two-dimensional echocardiographic wall motion abnormalities to morphologic evidence of myocardial infarction was evaluated in 20 autopsied patients. Comparisons were made between independent two-dimensional echocardiographic readings of left ventricular segmental wall motion and morphologic evidence of myocardial injury. Of 15 infarcts, 14 were detected by regional <b>akinesis,</b> dyskinesis or hypokinesis. The relationship between abnormal segmental wall motion and morphologic evidence of myocardial necrosis or fibrosis was significant. Seventy-nine of 88 (90 %) of infarcted segments showed abnormal wall motion, although 38 of 82 (46 %) of morphologically normal segments also demonstrated wall motion abnormalities. Fifty-eight of 65 segments that showed regional <b>akinesis</b> or dyskinesis were transmurally infarcted. Twenty-five of 38 pathologically normal segments seen by two-dimensional echocardiography as akinetic or dyskinetic were adjacent to scar. Hypokinesis was non-specific (31 segments normal, 21 subendocardial infarction). Normal wall motion excluded transmural infarc-tion (0 of 46 segments), but in one patient was associated with subendocardial injury (nine/ 42 segments).

40|$|Abstract Objective To {{describe}} {{two cases}} of Takotsubo like myocardial contractile pattern during exercise stress test secondary to hypertensive response. Background Treadmill exercise testing {{is known to}} cause sympathetic stimulation, leading to increased levels of catecholamine, resulting in alteration in vascular tone. Hypertensive response during exercise testing can cause abnormal consequences, resulting in false positive results. Cases We present the cases of two patients experiencing apical and basal <b>akinesis</b> during exercise stress echocardiography, in whom normal wall motion response was observed on subsequent pharmacologic stress testing. The first patient developed transient left ventricular (LV) apical <b>akinesis</b> during exercise stress echocardiography. Due to high suspicion that this abnormality might be secondary to hypertensive response, pharmacologic stress testing was performed after three days, which was completely normal and showed no such wall motion abnormality. Qualitative assessment of myocardial perfusion using contrast was also performed, which showed good myocardial blood flow, indicating low probability for significant obstructive coronary artery disease. The second patient developed LV basal <b>akinesis</b> {{as a result of}} hypertensive response during exercise testing. Coronary angiogram was not performed in either patient due to low suspicion for coronary artery disease, and subsequently negative stress studies. Results Transient stress induced cardiomyopathy can develop secondary to hypertensive response during exercise stress testing. Conclusion These cases provide supporting evidence to the hyper-sympathetic theory of left ventricular ballooning syndrome. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{intravenous}} propranolol on left ventricular wall motion and hemodynamics were studied in 16 patients, 12 with significant {{coronary artery disease}} and four with chest pain but no coronary disease. Eight patients received 0. 10 mg/kg and eight received 0. 15 mg/kg of propranolol intravenously. All un-derwent atrial pacing at a constant rate. Left ventricular angiograms were performed before and 20 minutes after propranolol. At both doses, propranolol caused no significant change in left ventricular systolic or diastolic pressures, either before or immediately following ventriculography. Cardiac index fell significantly (3. 4 ± 0. 2 [SEM] to 2. 6 ± 0. 1 L/min/m 2) with the higher dose only.

40|$|Introduction: Ischemic {{mitral valve}} {{regurgitation}} (IMR) often complicates ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) {{and leads to}} worse outcomes. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a promising new tool for comprehensive evaluation of patients after STEMI including left ventricular systolic performance and size, valvular regurgitations and infarct zone characteristics. Aim of the study: The aim {{of the study was}} to assess the predictors of IMR severity in patients suffering from STEMI with the use of CMR. Material and methods: The study included unselected group of 61 patients with first STEMI (mean age 59 &# 177; 11 years, 77 % male) who underwent CMR evaluation in the first 2 weeks after myocardial infarction. The degree of IMR was based on the regurgitation fraction (RF) according to previously proposed cut-off values for CMR (none or mild &#x 2270; 15 %, moderate - 16 - 24 %, moderate-severe - 25 - 42 %, severe > 42 %). Analyzed parameters included: left ventricular global and regional systolic function, left ventricular size and mass, mitral valve coaptation depth, mitral annular diameter (MAD), anterior mitral leaflet length (AMLL), left atrial (LA) area, interpapillary muscle distance in end-systole (IPDsyst) and end-diastole (IPDdiast) and infarct zone parameters (myocardial edema, location and transmural extent of necrosis, infarct size, microvascular obstruction and/or myocardial haemorrhage). Results: The study group was divided into 3 subgroups: 43 patients (71 %) with none or mild IMR, 10 patients (16 %) with moderate IMR and 8 patients (13 %) with moderate-severe IMR. There were no cases of severe IMR. Univariate predictors of IMR severity included older age, higher left atrial area, lower left ventricular ejection fraction and higher frequency of mid-ventricular infero-lateral segment <b>akinesis</b> or necrosis. Older age (r= 0. 235, p= 0. 01) and <b>akinesis</b> of the mid-ventricular infero-lateral segments (r= 0. 408, p= 0. 0003) were found to be independent predictors of IMR severity in multivariable regression analysis. Transmural necrosis of akinetic mid-ventricular infero-lateral segments was found in 75 % of patients with more than mild IMR. Conclusions: <b>Akinesis</b> of the mid-ventricular infero-lateral segments is the main predictor of IMR severity following STEMI.

40|$|Endoaneurysmorrhaphy (EAR) {{has become}} an {{important}} therapeutic option {{in the treatment of}} patients with left ventricular (LV) aneurysm and congestive heart failure. Today, more and more patients are referred for EAR with a dilated akinetic LV rather than a classic dyskinetic LV aneurysm. Little is known about the contribution of the extent of <b>akinesis</b> to perioperative mortality. We reviewed the data of 147 patients with anterior left ventricular aneurysms undergoing EAR. Seventy percent of the patients were male; mean age was 62 9 years. Demographic, hemodynamic, angiographic and surgical variables were analyzed using univariate statistic tests in order to determine risk factors for in-hospital mortality. Eighty-two percent of the LV aneurysms had at least some dyskinesia, but 70 % were mainly akinetic. 133 patients had additional bypass surgery, one had additional mitral valve replacement. In-hospital mortality was 4. 1 % (n= 6). Risk factors for in-hospital mortality were the total extent of akinetic myocardium (p= 0. 027) in the 30 degrees RAO view and the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB, p= 0. 0068) which was itself dependent on the IV ejection fraction (p= 0. 001), the number of stenosed coronary arteries (p = 0. 004), and the extent of <b>akinesis</b> (p = 0. 023). The extent of dyskinesia was not associated with either perioperative mortality (p= 0. 36) or CPB duration. EAR can be performed with acceptable perioperative results.

40|$|Introduction. Takotsubo {{cardiomyopathy}} is {{a transient}} acute heart failure syndrome caused by stress that provokes left ventricular mid-apical <b>akinesis</b> and mimics acute coronary syndrome. Case report. A 66 -year-old woman had chest pain and dispnoea {{a few hours}} before hospitalization. A sudden emotional stressful event preceded the symptoms. Electrocardiographic abnormalities - precordial ST elevation and modest increase of cardiac troponin mimiced acute myocardial infarction. However, echocardiographic examination showed apical ballooning with markedly diminished left ventricle ejection fraction and the obstruction in the outflow tract of the left ventricle. Coronary angiography at admission showed no coronary stenosis and slower blood flow through the left anterior descending artery. According to anamnesis, echocardiography and coronarography finding we established the diagnosis of stress cardiomyopathy - takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

BackgroundGuidelines suggest adding oral anticoagulation to dual-antiplatelet therapy in patients with STEMI when left ventricular apical <b>akinesis</b> or dyskinesis is present to prevent thromboembolic complications. The benefits of this triple therapy remain unknown. MethodsWe identified patients with anterior STEMI referred (PCI) between July 2004 and June 2010 with apical <b>akinesis</b> or dyskinesis on transthoracic echocardiography. We compared patients who were prescribed warfarin to patients who were not. We excluded patients with left ventricular thrombus, a separate need for oral anticoagulation, and previous intracranial bleeding. The primary outcome was a composite of net adverse clinical events (NACE) consisting of all-cause mortality, stroke, reinfarction, and major bleeding at 180 days. ResultsAmong 460 patients who qualified, 131 were discharged on warfarin therapy and 329 without warfarin therapy. Dual-antiplatelet therapy was prescribed for 99. 2 % of the patients in the warfarin group and for 97. 6 % of the patients in the no warfarin group (p = 0. 46). Compared with patients in the no warfarin group, patients in the warfarin group had higher rates of NACE (14. 7 % vs. 4. 6 %, p = 0. 001), death (5. 4 % vs. 1. 5 %, p = 0. 04), stroke (3. 1 % vs. 0. 3 %, p =  0. 02), and major bleeding (8. 5 % vs. 1. 8 %, p < 0. 0001). By propensity score analysis, allocation to warfarin therapy was an independent predictor of NACE (odds ratio [OR]: 4. 01, 95 % confidence interval: 2. 15 to 7. 50, p < 0. 0001). In a separate multivariable analysis, the OR of NACE remained significantly higher compared with patients who were not prescribed warfarin (OR: 3. 13, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 34 to 7. 22, p = 0. 007).
