5|$|Apollo Justice was {{developed}} {{by a team of}} 28 staff members. It was produced by Minae Matsukawa and directed by Mitsuru Endo, with character design and art by Kazuya Nuri, while series creator Shu Takumi wrote the game's scenario and took on a supervisory role. Takumi had wanted the series to end with the previous game, as he felt its main character, Phoenix Wright, had been fully explored and that his story had been told; he said {{that it is important to}} know when to end a story, that he did not want the series to become a shadow of its former self, and that he did not see <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> continue it. When it was still decided that a fourth game would be made, Takumi wanted it to have a new main character and a new story; he did not plan to have Phoenix appear in the game, but his colleagues wanted him in the game in some form, which led to him being the accused in the first case in the game.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty was {{weighted}} in Alexios' {{favor and}} {{provided for the}} eventual absorption of Antioch and its territory into the Empire. Alexios, recognizing the impossibility of driving Bohemond out of Antioch, tried to absorb him into the structure of Byzantine rule, and put him work for the Empire's benefit. Bohemond was to retain Antioch until his death with the title of doux, unless the emperor (either Alexios or, in the future, John) chose for <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> renege on the deal. The principality would revert to direct Byzantine rule on Bohemond's death. Bohemond therefore could not set up a dynasty in Antioch, although he was guaranteed the right {{to pass on to}} his heirs the County of Edessa, and any other territories he managed to acquire in the Syrian interior.|$|E
5|$|For {{the fourth}} game, Takumi wrote the {{scenario}} and {{took on a}} supervisory role. He had wanted the series to end with the third game, as he felt Phoenix had been fully explored and that his story had been told; {{he said that it}} is important to know when to end a story, that he did not want the series to become a shadow of its former self, and that he did not see <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> continue it. Despite this, the spin-off series Ace Attorney Investigations was created, being directed by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro; Takumi returned to the series to write the crossover Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. He also directed and wrote Dai Gyakuten Saiban, which was described as being the first entry in a new Ace Attorney series. He said that he has mixed feelings about the series being developed by other Capcom staff, comparing it to a parent sending their child to their first day in school. Yamazaki and Eshiro went on to direct and produce the main series entries Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice. Due to exhaustion after working on Dual Destinies, Yamazaki split direction responsibilities with Takuro Fuse for Spirit of Justice, with Yamazaki working on the scenario, and Fuse on the art and gameplay.|$|E

5|$|German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel {{presented}} {{two main}} criticisms of Kantian ethics. He first argued that Kantian ethics provides no specific {{information about what}} people should do because Kant's moral law is solely a principle of non-contradiction. He argued that Kant's ethics lack any content and so cannot constitute a supreme principle of morality. To illustrate this point, Hegel and his followers have presented {{a number of cases}} in which the Formula of Universal Law either provides no meaningful answer or gives an obviously wrong answer. Hegel used Kant's example of being trusted with another man's money to argue that Kant's Formula of Universal Law cannot determine whether a social system of property is a morally good thing, because either answer can entail contradictions. He also used the example of helping the poor: if everyone helped the poor, there would be no poor left to help, so beneficence would be impossible if universalised, making it immoral according to Kant's model. Hegel's second criticism was that Kant's ethics forces humans into an internal conflict between reason and desire. For Hegel, it is unnatural for humans to suppress their desire and subordinate it to reason. This means that, by not addressing the tension between self-interest and morality, Kant's ethics cannot give humans <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> be moral.|$|E

50|$|The year 1820 {{was marked}} by intense {{political}} activity in Portugal, as the people were demanding the immediate return of the royal family, which lead to the Liberal Revolution of 1820.

25|$|Both parties {{appealed to}} the Second Circuit. The McMahons sought to reverse the order to {{arbitrate}} the 1934 Act claims, and Shearson sought to have the RICO claims arbitrated as well. In early 1986 a panel composed of the circuit's then-chief judge, Wilfred Feinberg, Jon O. Newman, and William Homer Timbers heard oral arguments. They held for the McMahons on both issues, reversing Judge MacMahon on the arbitration order and thus ordering that the RICO claims proceed {{since there was no}} longer <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> stay them.|$|E
25|$|A 2007 {{study of}} oil {{depletion}} by the UK Energy Research Centre {{pointed out that}} there is no theoretical and no robust practical reason to assume that oil production will follow a logistic curve.

25|$|At {{the end of}} the {{frontier}} wars, the Qing army had started to weaken significantly. In addition to a more lenient military system, warlords became satisfied with their lifestyles. Since most of the warring had already taken place, warlords no longer saw <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> train their armies, resulting in a rapid military decline by {{the end of the}} Qianlong Emperor's reign. This was the main reason for the Qing military's failure to suppress the White Lotus Rebellion, which started towards the end of the Qianlong Emperor's reign and extended into the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor.|$|E
25|$|Qazi Muhammad's {{internal}} support eventually declined, {{especially among the}} Kurdish tribes who had supported him initially. Their crops and supplies were dwindling, and {{their way of life}} was becoming hard {{as a result of the}} isolation. Economic aid and military assistance from the Soviet Union was gone, and the tribes saw no reason to support him. The townspeople and the tribes had a large divide between them, and their alliance for Mahabad was crumbling. The tribes and their leaders had only supported Qazi Muhammad for his economic and military aid from the Soviet Union. Once that was gone, many did not see <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> support him. Other tribes resented the Barzanis, since they did not like sharing their already dwindling resources with them. Some Kurds deserted Mahabad, including one of Mahabad's own marshals, Amir Khan. Mahabad was economically bankrupt, and it would have been nearly impossible for Mahabad to have been economically sound without harmony with Iran.|$|E
25|$|Systems that don't have {{a trusted}} {{computing}} base {{as part of their}} design do not provide security of their own: they are only secure insofar as security is provided to them by external means (e.g. a computer sitting in a locked room without a network connection may be considered secure depending on the policy, regardless of the software it runs). This is because, as David J. Farber et al. put it, n a computer system, the integrity of lower layers is typically treated as axiomatic by higher layers. As far as computer security is concerned, reasoning about the security properties of a computer system requires being able to make sound assumptions about what it can, and more importantly, cannot do; however, barring <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe otherwise, a computer is able to do everything that a general Von Neumann machine can. This obviously includes operations that would be deemed contrary to all but the simplest security policies, such as divulging an email or password that should be kept secret; however, barring special provisions in the architecture of the system, there is no denying that the computer could be programmed to perform these undesirable tasks.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In recent work, Thomas Kroedel has {{proposed}} a novel solution to the lottery paradox. As he sees it, we are permitted/justified in believing some lottery propositions, {{but we are not}} permitted/justified in believing them all. I criticize this proposal on two fronts. First, I think that if we had the right to add some lottery beliefs to our belief set, we would not have <b>any</b> decisive <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> stop adding more. Suggestions to the contrary run into the wrong kind of reason problem. Reflection on the preface paradox suggests as much. Second, while I agree with Kroedel that permissions do not agglomate, I do not think that this fact can help us solve the lottery paradox. First, I do not think we have <b>any</b> good <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> think that we’re permitted to believe any lottery propositions. Second, I do not see <b>any</b> good <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> think that epistemic permissions do not agglomerate...|$|R

500|$|Hilda Ellis Davidson (1948) {{states that}} Hel [...] "as a goddess" [...] in {{surviving}} sources seems {{to belong to}} a genre of literary personification, that the word hel is generally [...] "used simply to signify death or the grave," [...] and that the word often appears as the equivalent to the English 'death,' which Davidson states [...] "naturally lends itself to personification by poets." [...] Davidson explains that [...] "whether this personification has originally been based on a belief in a goddess of death called Hel is another question," [...] but that she does not believe that the surviving sources give <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe so. Davidson adds that, on the other hand, various other examples of [...] "certain supernatural women" [...] connected with death {{are to be found in}} sources for Norse mythology, that they [...] "seem to have been closely connected with the world of death, and were pictured as welcoming dead warriors," [...] and that the depiction of Hel [...] "as a goddess" [...] in Gylfaginning [...] "might well owe something to these." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the most}} part, British commanders {{did not hold}} Patton in high regard. Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke noted in January 1943 that [...] "I had heard of him, but I must confess that his swashbuckling {{personality}} exceeded my expectation. I did not form any high opinion of him, nor had I <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> alter this view at any later date. A dashing, courageous, wild and unbalanced leader, good for operations requiring thrust and push but at a loss in any operation requiring skill and judgment." [...] One possible exception was Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery. Although the latter's rivalry with Patton was well known, Montgomery appears to have admired Patton's ability to command troops in the field, if not his strategic judgment. Other Allied commanders were more impressed, the Free French in particular. General Henri Giraud was incredulous when he heard of Patton's dismissal by Eisenhower in late 1945, and invited him to Paris to be decorated by President Charles de Gaulle at a state banquet. At the banquet, President de Gaulle gave a speech placing Patton's achievements alongside those of Napoleon. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was apparently an admirer, stating that the Red Army could neither have planned nor executed Patton's rapid armored advance across France.|$|E
500|$|Tupelo Honey {{was well}} {{received}} by critics upon the album's release. Jon Landau wrote in Rolling Stone: [...] "Tupelo Honey {{is in one}} sense but {{another example of the}} artist making increased use of the album as the unit of communication as opposed to merely the song or the cut. Everything on it is perfectly integrated." [...] ZigZag magazine reviewer John Tobler, who also reviewed the album just after its release, gave the album high praise, saying [...] "If all music were as good as this, there wouldn't be <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> make any more, because this is the real thing." [...] Critic Dave Marsh called it [...] "the perfect album for Van: he does everything...so incredibly well. There isn't a bad cut on it, of that I'm really sure." [...] Robert Christgau from The Village Voice voiced reservations in his praise of the album, writing that it was [...] "almost as rich in cute tunes as The Shirelles' Greatest Hits, but I worry that domestic bliss with Janet Planet has been softening Van's noodle more than the joy of cooking requires." [...] Tupelo Honey was later ranked the fourth best album {{of the year in the}} Village Voice's first annual Pazz & Jop Critics Poll.|$|E
