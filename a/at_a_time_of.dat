5|$|A public {{announcement}} of the new pieces was made on May 15, 1965, only to be met with a storm of objections. Both the public and many congressmen saw the issue as a poor use of Mint resources <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> severe coin shortages, which would only benefit coin dealers. On May 24, one day before a hastily called congressional hearing, Adams announced that the pieces were deemed trial strikes, never intended for circulation. The Mint later stated that 316,076 pieces had been struck; all were reported melted amid heavy security. To ensure {{that there would be}} no repetition, Congress inserted a provision in the Coinage Act of 1965 forbidding the coinage of silver dollars for five years. That act also removed silver from the dime and quarter, and reduced the silver content of the half dollar to 40%.|$|E

5|$|Burger King's first broiled chicken {{sandwich}} {{was introduced}} in 1990 and was called the BK Broiler. This sandwich was made with lettuce, tomato and a dill ranch sauce served on an oat dusted roll. The product came <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> fundamental change in terms of chicken product in the restaurant industry; more than 90% of chicken products sold by the major chains were fried. Shortly after its introduction, the sandwich was selling {{more than a million}} units per day, and poaching sales from traditional fried chicken chains such as Kentucky Fried Chicken. Additionally, the sandwiches were part of an industry trend towards the diversification of menus with healthier products such as reformulated cooking methods and salads. At the time, the sandwich had 379 calories and 18grams of fat, 10 of which came from the sauce.|$|E

The relationship between Muslims in Denmark and the broader society was similarly at a low-point, and the conflict came to symbolise the misunderstandings between the Islamic community {{and the rest of}} society. In the years since, terrorist plots claiming to be in retaliation for the cartoons have been planned, and some executed, against targets affiliated with newspapers that published the cartoons or Denmark.|$|E

This made the currency less stable and, coupled with the emergence of the dollar as the currency of choice for foreign reserves, led the government to slash the Bretton Woods official exchange rate from $4.03 to $2.80. This was a major event in Britain's decline from superpower status. With the country struggling to feed its people at home and those it was responsible for in war-torn Europe, it also caused the US to take a greater interest in Europe and push through the Marshall Plan for assistance to Britain and the continent. In addition, the winter is cited as the reason for the emigration of thousands of British people, particularly to Australia. The winter as a whole was less cold than the winter of 1963 but more snow was recorded.|$|E

30|$|The last clear peak was {{successfully}} identified {{as that of}} guaiacol, which confirms that the β-O- 4 bond of compound 1 certainly cleaves in the O 2 -Valc system. The yield was 12 – 18 % in the reaction of compound 1 E or 1 T using 0.5 or 0.1  mol/L NaOH <b>at</b> <b>a</b> reaction <b>time</b> <b>of</b> 60  min, when Valc disappeared. A similar amount of guaiacol was also detected in the reaction of compound 1 in the O 2 -Valc system of our previous study [35]. Guaiacol was not detected <b>at</b> all <b>at</b> <b>a</b> reaction <b>time</b> <b>of</b> 360  min. The relatively low yield <b>of</b> guaiacol <b>at</b> <b>a</b> reaction <b>time</b> <b>of</b> 60  min and its disappearance <b>at</b> <b>a</b> reaction <b>time</b> <b>of</b> 360  min result {{from the fact that}} molecular oxygen directly oxidizes guaiacol. Because almost no guaiacol was detected in the O 2 -TMPh system, however, the β-O- 4 bond of compound 1 may be cleaved more frequently in the O 2 -Valc than in the O 2 -TMPh system. In contrast, the yields of veratraldehyde were not different between the O 2 -TMPh and O 2 -Valc systems. Therefore, the mechanism of the side-chain degradation is suggested to be different between these systems, leading to similar amounts of veratraldehyde but different amounts of guaiacol.|$|R
