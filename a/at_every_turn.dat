5|$|After {{the battle}} on the {{southern}} side of the Shangani was over, Forbes and his column conducted a cursory search for survivors from Wilson's party, but, unable to cross the river, could see nothing {{to tell them what}} had happened. Guessing (correctly) that all Company men beyond the river had been killed, they turned and trekked back to Bulawayo in miserable fashion, their supplies all but gone and the Matabele impeding their progress <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{took office}} {{determined}} {{to reform the}} system of civil service appointments, which had been based on the spoils system since Andrew Jackson was president. Instead of giving federal jobs to political supporters, Hayes wished to award them by merit according to an examination that all applicants would take. Immediately, Hayes's call for reform brought him into conflict with the Stalwart, or pro-spoils, branch of the Republican party. Senators of both parties were accustomed to being consulted about political appointments and turned against Hayes. Foremost among his enemies was New York Senator Roscoe Conkling, who fought Hayes's reform efforts <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|E
5|$|On Valentine's Day in Springfield, Lisa's {{class at}} the Springfield Elementary School {{construction}} paper mailboxes for the Valentine cards {{they are about to}} receive. When Ralph does not get any cards and breaks down in tears, Lisa hastily gives him a card out of sympathy. Ralph immediately cheers up, and develops a romantic interest in her. Ralph begins to annoy Lisa <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>turn.</b> Lisa tries to escape the situation by telling Ralph she is not ready to be romantic, but Ralph uses his position as Chief Wiggum's son to get her tickets to Krusty the Clown's upcoming 29th Anniversary Special, as well as a leading part for himself in a President's Day pageant in which Lisa also stars. Ralph receives the role of George Washington opposite Lisa as Martha Washington.|$|E

5|$|The hostility {{between rival}} Spanish factions in Trujillo continued, and Vasco de Herrera {{was unable to}} unite the colonists behind him. He decided the best option would be to found a new town, and {{possibly}} abandon Trujillo. Cerezeda opposed him <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>turn,</b> believing this {{would lead to the}} ruin of the Spanish enterprise in Honduras. Natives working the mines near Trujillo rebelled against their excessive tax burden, killing several Spaniards. Vasco de Herrera seized this opportunity as an excuse to launch a punitive expedition, but instead marched inland in an attempt to found another colony. The Nahuas of Papayeca rebelled against the excessive cruelty of Andrés de Cereceda under their leader Picecura, and fled to the wilds. In 1531, Vasco de Herrera attempted to bring them back to their settlements.|$|E
25|$|Remington Rand, however, {{continued}} {{a policy}} of harassment and obstruction toward the union. It often violated the contract in small ways (forcing the union to file time-consuming and costly grievances), harassed union leaders, and generally contested the union <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hagatha von Taterbugs, a gleefully disgusting HIV {{positive}} drag queen with borderline {{personality disorder}} who hangs {{out in public}} restrooms and drinks urine/fecal matter. Her trashy exploits and long history of atrocities have shocked and astounded even Madge and Cheryl. Cheryl despises Hagatha and undercuts her <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{practical}} exam covers {{everything that}} should have been learned: looking in the inside mirror, then the wing mirror and then over one's shoulder <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>turn</b> (twice per turn), driving onto and on the motorway, knowing what is under the bonnet, what all the lights on the dashboard mean, etc.|$|E
25|$|Many other {{denominations}} {{volunteered to}} help. In 1871, John H. Stout, {{sponsored by the}} Dutch Reformed Church, {{was sent to the}} Pima reservation in Arizona to implement the policy. However Congress, the church, and private charities spent less money than was needed; the local whites strongly disliked the Indians; the Pima balked at removal; and Stout was frustrated <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{the group}} keeps {{trying to escape}} out of the realm, they end up {{ultimately}} running into dead ends <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>turn.</b> Suddenly, thanks to Henry inspiring the New Yorkers to toss coins into the Bethesda fountain, a portal opens, and Hook, Snow, David, Zelena, and Jekyll escape and find themselves in New York City, {{right in front of}} the fountain, where they renuite with Emma, Regina, Henry, and Violet.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Stop thief! Stop thief!' The cry {{is taken}} up by a hundred voices, and the crowd {{accumulate}} <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>turning.</b> Away they fly, splashing through the mud, and rattling along the pavements: up go the windows, out run the people, onward bear the mob, a whole audience desert Punch in the very thickest of the plot, and, joining the rushing throng, swell the shout, and lend fresh vigour to the cry, 'Stop thief! Stop thief!' ...|$|R

25|$|The Portuguese vanguard {{ascended the}} Balana pass, {{capturing}} stockades <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>turn.</b> Despite being {{separated from the}} main body of the army, they continued to advance and soon entered an area of relatively flat land called the Danture tract. By nightfall they had reached Gannoruwa, where they spent the night on the western bank of the Mahaveli River—still separated from the main army, which lagged behind in order to bury the dead and because of its slow baggage train.|$|E
25|$|Cirque du Soleil and Marvel Entertainment {{teamed up}} to adapt Kà through a limited four-part series of {{collectible}} comic books. Created by comic book writer Bryan J.L. Glass, artist Wellinton Alves and colorist Jean-Francois Beaulieu, these comics follow the heroic journey of the Imperial Twins, separated by war, who encounter adventure and peril <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>turn</b> on their quest to reunite their kingdom. The first installment debuted at the Marvel booth at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con on July 12 – 15, then a wide release followed into comic book stores and a digital download version with subsequent issues to come.|$|E
25|$|Advocates of a National Board of Health, {{including}} Army Surgeon John Shaw Billings, were spurred {{to action}} by the insufficient funding allotted to the Quarantine Act of 1878. Over the following four years, Hamilton would press Billings <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>turn,</b> in a protracted, ultimately successful effort to regain authorities and recognition of MHS as the central Federal public health agency. When Billings began publishing MHS's Bulletin under the Board's auspices, Hamilton countered by persuading Congress to fund new Marine Hospitals in locations like Sitka, Alaska, to strengthen collaboration with the Revenue Cutter Service (predecessor to the United States Coast Guard).|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, very well,' {{answered}} the seaman; 'exceedingly well--like a tight ship in a brisk gale. Let me recollect. I remember thanking Jack, very composedly, for the interesting and agreeable communication; I then {{pulled out my}} canvas pouch, with my hoard of moidores, and taking out two pieces, I bid Jack keep the rest till I came back, as I was for a cruise about Auld Reekie. The poor devil looked anxiously, but I shook him by the hand, and ran downstairs, in such confusion of mind, that notwithstanding what I had heard, I expected to meet Jess <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>turning.</b>|$|R
60|$|Georgy sends best {{love to you}} and to Mrs. Forster, so do I, so does Plorn, so does Frank. The girls are, {{for five}} days, with the Whites at Ramsgate. It is raining, {{intensely}} hot, and stormy. Eighteen creatures, like little tortoises, have dashed in at the window and fallen on the paper since I began this paragraph [Illustration: ink-blot] (that was one!). I am a wretched sort of creature in my way, but it is a way that gets on somehow. And all ways have the same fingerpost at the head of them, and <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>turning</b> in them.|$|R
60|$|But, in truth, {{no one can}} now {{travel through}} the more frequented tracts, without being offended, <b>at</b> almost <b>every</b> <b>turn,</b> by an {{introduction}} of discordant objects, disturbing that peaceful harmony of form and colour, which had been through a long lapse of ages most happily preserved.|$|R
25|$|After ending Reconstruction, Hayes {{turned to}} the issue of {{reforming}} the system of civil service appointments. Instead of giving federal jobs to political supporters or the favorites of powerful members of Congress, Hayes wished to award positions by merit according to an examination that all applicants would take. Immediately, Hayes's call for reform brought him into conflict with the Stalwart, or pro-spoils, branch of the Republican party. Senators of both parties who were accustomed to being consulted about political appointments turned against Hayes. Foremost among his enemies was New York Senator Roscoe Conkling, who fought Hayes's reform efforts <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{frustrated}} Australia team faced a fearless England side who challenged them <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>turn,</b> {{and recovered}} nicely {{even after the}} dismissals of Trescothick and Vaughan, who couldn't resist smacking a full toss from Katich straight to McGrath at the boundary. Vaughan was dismissed after 166 runs, which {{was destined to be}} the highest individual score in the series. Australia were also faced with a more defiant Ian Bell, who had struggled in the first two Tests. Picking up where Vaughan left off after tea, Bell, Kevin Pietersen and nightwatchman Matthew Hoggard closed out the day for England with the score 341 for 5.|$|E
25|$|The new pope, Pius III, {{supported}} Cesare Borgia and reconfirmed him as Gonfalonier; {{but after}} a brief pontificate of twenty-six days he died. Borgia's deadly enemy, Giuliano Della Rovere, then succeeded by dexterous diplomacy in tricking the weakened Cesare Borgia into supporting him by offering him money and continued papal backing for Borgia policies in the Romagna; promises which he disregarded upon election. He was elected as Pope Julius II to the papal dignity by the near-unanimous vote of the cardinals. Realizing his mistake by then, Cesare tried to correct the situation to his favour, but Pope Julius II made sure of its failure <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|E

Yes, I thought so," [...] he went on, as he stood up in his {{stirrups}} and looked back; [...] "there, do you see that horse's head in that little thicket, just this side of where the road separates? I expected as much. If we had turned off, in another two minutes that fellow would have been galloping along this road to take the news to those ahead, and they would have ridden to cut us off further along. I {{have no doubt}} we shall find someone on watch <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>turning</b> between this and Orleans." ...|$|R
60|$|After due {{refreshment}} and repose {{we continued}} our route, ascending the Jura, towards the Dôle, {{which is the}} highest mountain of that range. A macadamized road coiled up the mountain side, affording us <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>turning</b> {{a new and more}} splendid view of the other shore of the lake. At length we reached St. Cergue, and leaving the carriage, H. and I, guided by a peasant girl, went through the woods to the highest point, where were the ruins of the ancient chateau. Far be it from me to describe what we saw. I feel that I have already been too presumptuous. We sat down, and each made a hasty sketch of Mont Blanc.|$|R
60|$|But as {{the person}} sent back {{was one of those}} who had taken the journal which I mentioned, and was {{therefore}} greatly vexed at missing his way in such a manner, so he had his eyes in every corner, and pulled out his pocket-book <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>turning,</b> to see how the marks of the places agreed; and at last, the very next morning after he set out, he spied the turning where they should all have gone in, to have come to the place which they were at before; this being so remarkable a discovery, he came back again directly, without going on to the Chilian's house, which was two days' journey farther.|$|R
25|$|Walking {{the streets}} of Venice, Aschenbach is accosted <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>turn</b> by beggars, street sellers and others {{demanding}} his custom. Seeing rubbish {{on the streets and}} smelling the foul water of the canals, he feels nauseated and claustrophobic, and decides that he must leave Venice. Back at the hotel, the Manager expresses his regret over Aschenbach's departure. When Tadzio returns Aschenbach's glances, Aschenbach himself also feels regret. On arriving at the station, Aschenbach finds that his luggage has been sent on the wrong train ("I am furious because I am forced to return, but secretly I rejoice. Vacillating, irresolute, absurd"), and he realises upon seeing Tadzio again that the boy was the cause of his regret at leaving.|$|E
25|$|Only 58 {{when he left}} office, Hoover {{held out}} hope for another term during the 1930s. At the 1936 Republican National Convention, Hoover's speech attacking the New Deal was well received, but the {{nomination}} went to Kansas Governor Alf Landon. In the general election, Hoover campaigned for Landon's unsuccessful campaign with numerous well-publicized speeches attacking New Deal liberalism. Though Hoover was eager to oppose Roosevelt <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>turn,</b> and Senator Arthur Vandenberg and other Republicans urged the still-unpopular Hoover to remain out of the fray during the debate over Roosevelt's proposed Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937. At the 1940 Republican National Convention, Hoover again hoped for the presidential nomination, and was dismayed when {{it went to the}} internationalist Wendell Willkie.|$|E
25|$|Lastly he {{met with}} his former {{commanding}} officer in Norway, Marschall. He advised Lütjens not to follow Raeder's orders too closely since {{the situation in the}} Atlantic could change at any moment. Lütjens would not hear of it. He refused to diverge from his standing orders. He reminded Marschall that two fleet commanders had already been removed from command—Marschall being one of them—and that he would follow the orders given him. What depressed Lütjens's already darkened mood was the fact that Ernst Lindemann, Bismarck's captain, was told by Karl Topp of the Marineamt, that he had run several war games to see if Tirpitz could reach the Atlantic undetected and that <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>turn</b> and under every circumstance, the ship was discovered. Lindemann certainly would have passed this information to Lütjens.|$|E

60|$|Yet {{it was all}} unconsciously said {{in words}} which betrayed a {{lingering}} tenderness of love <b>at</b> <b>every</b> unguarded <b>turn.</b> Like Beatrice accusing Dante from the chariot, try as she might to play the superior being who contemned such mere eye-sensuousness, she betrayed <b>at</b> <b>every</b> point a pretty woman's jealousy of a rival, and covertly gave her old lover hints for excusing himself at each fresh indictment.|$|R
50|$|The {{children}} rebel <b>at</b> <b>every</b> possible <b>turn</b> {{despite being}} held against their will. They talk back to Mr. Prouch and, when {{he loses his}} spectacles in a rage, make their first escape attempt. However, it fails when they find themselves caught climbing over the castle's surrounding wall. They also start a food fight at dinner one night.|$|R
