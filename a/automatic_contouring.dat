40|$|In {{this paper}} we suggest an {{approach}} to a completely <b>automatic</b> <b>contouring</b> the left ventricle (LV). We use the method of signatures to describe {{the shape of the}} contour. Analysis of contours performed manually enables us to conclude that the signature of any contour of any patient has the shape of the inverted letter "M". This allows reducing the contouring problem to the problem of signature reconstruction. So, the task is transferred from a two-dimensional space in a one-dimensional. Algorithm of semi-automatic contouring based on the known first frame contours is described. So, {{it is obvious that the}} problem of completely <b>automatic</b> <b>contouring</b> demands to select the contour on the first frame automatically. Solution of this problem is to restore the signature with the correct shape in the form of the inverted letter "M" and we offer a way to do it...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES. Aortic {{compliance}} {{is defined}} as the relative change in aortic cross-sectional area divided by the change in arterial pressure. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a useful imaging modality for the noninvasive evaluation of aortic compliance. However, manual tracing of the aortic contour is subject to important interobserver variations. To estimate the aortic compliance from cine-MRI, a method based on fuzzy logic theory was elaborated. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Seven healthy volunteers and eight patients with Marfan syndrome were examined using an ECG gated cine-MRI sequence. The aorta was imaged in the transverse plane {{at the level of the}} pulmonary trunk. A method based on fuzzy logic was developed to automatically detect the aortic contour. RESULTS. Through our robust <b>automatic</b> <b>contouring</b> method, the calculation of aortic cross-sectional areas allows an estimation of the aortic compliance. CONCLUSION. The aortic compliance can be obtained from a fuzzy logic based <b>automatic</b> <b>contouring</b> method, thereby avoiding the important interobserver variation often associated with manual tracing...|$|E

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this {{dissertation}} is to optimize and evaluate {{the performance of the}} single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) subsystem of a dedicated three-dimensional (3 D) dual-modality breast imaging system for enhanced semi-automated, quantitative clinical imaging. This novel hybrid imaging system combines functional or molecular information obtained with a SPECT subsystem with high-resolution anatomical imaging obtained with a low dose x-ray Computed Tomography (CT) subsystem. In this new breast imaging paradigm, coined "mammotomography," the subject is imaged lying prone while the individual subsystems sweep 3 -dimensionally about her uncompressed, pendant breast, providing patient comfort compared to traditional compression-based imaging modalities along with high fidelity and information rich images for the clinician. 	System evaluation includes a direct comparison between dedicated 3 D SPECT and dedicated 2 D scintimammography imaging using the same high performance, semi-conductor gamma camera.

The smallest object detail was observed using a 45 -degree tilted trajectory acquisition. The complex 3 D projected sine wave acquisition, however, had the most consistent combined intra and inter-observer results, making it potentially the best imaging approach for consistent clinical imaging. 	<b>Automatic</b> ROR <b>contouring</b> is implemented using a dual-layer light curtain design, ensuring that an arbitrarily shaped breast is within ~ 1 cm of the camera face, but no closer than 0. 5 cm at every projection angle of a scan. Autocontouring enables simplified routine scanning using complex 3 D trajectories, and yields improved image quality. Absolute quantification capabilities are also integrated into the SPECT system, allowing the calculation of in vivo total lesion activity. Initial feasibility studies in controlled low noise experiments show promising results with total activity agreement within 10 % of the dose calibrator values. 	The SPECT system is integrated with a CT scanner for added diagnostic power. Initial human subject studies demonstrate the clinical potential of the hybrid SPECT-CT breast imaging system. The reconstructed SPECT-CT images illustrate the power of fusing functional SPECT information to localize lesions not easily seen in the anatomical CT images. Enhanced quantitative 3 D SPECT-CT breast imaging, now with the ability to dynamically contour any sized breast, has high potential to improve detection, diagnosis, and characterization of breast cancer in upcoming larger-scale clinical testing.

40|$|Abstract Purpose To validate, in {{the context}} of {{adaptive}} radiotherapy, three commercial software solutions for atlas-based segmentation. Methods and materials Fifteen patients, five for each group, with cancer of the Head&Neck, pleura, and prostate were enrolled in the study. In addition to the treatment planning CT (pCT) images, one replanning CT (rCT) image set was acquired for each patient during the RT course. Three experienced physicians outlined on the pCT and rCT all the volumes of interest (VOIs). We used three software solutions (VelocityAI 2. 6. 2 (V), MIM 5. 1. 1 (M) by MIMVista and ABAS 2. 0 (A) by CMS-Elekta) to generate the <b>automatic</b> <b>contouring</b> on the repeated CT. All the VOIs obtained with <b>automatic</b> <b>contouring</b> (AC) were successively corrected manually. We recorded the time needed for: 1) ex novo ROIs definition on rCT; 2) generation of AC by the three software solutions; 3) manual correction of AC. To compare the quality of the volumes obtained automatically by the software and manually corrected with those drawn from scratch on rCT, we used the following indexes: overlap coefficient (DICE), sensitivity, inclusiveness index, difference in volume, and displacement differences on three axes (x, y, z) from the isocenter. Results The time saved by the three software solutions for all the sites, compared to the manual contouring from scratch, is statistically significant and similar for all the three software solutions. The time saved for each site are as follows: about an hour for Head&Neck, about 40 [*]minutes for prostate, and about 20 [*]minutes for mesothelioma. The best DICE similarity coefficient index was obtained with the manual correction for: A (contours for prostate), A and M (contours for H&N), and M (contours for mesothelioma). Conclusions From a clinical point of view, the automated contouring workflow was shown to be significantly shorter than the manual contouring process, even though manual correction of the VOIs is always needed. </p...|$|E

The delineation of gross tumour volume (GTV) is crucial in the treatment of radiotherapy.

40|$|During the {{radiation}} therapy (RT) process, {{the treatment is}} planned and simulated with a treatment planning system (TPS) : the organs at risk (OAR) and the tumor target are identified and contoured, and the RT dose, delivered by the planned photon beams, is obtained for optimization of the resulting plan. The contouring work-up of tumor target identifies the Planning Treatment Volume (PTV), i. e. the physical RT treatment volume. PTV of glioblastomas (GB) includes, after expansion, Gross Tumor Volume (GTV, the tumor) and Clinical Target Volume (CTV, tumor plus edema). Usually, GTV contouring is performed manually. In this work, we used GlioCAD, a Computer-Assisted Detection software for <b>automatic</b> <b>contouring</b> of gliomas in MRI/DTI, to delineate GTV.

The calculation of this parameter, based on the change in vessel cross-sectional area per unit change in blood pressure, requires precise delineation of the aortic wall {{on a series of}} cine-MR images. Firstly, the study consisted in validating a new automatic method to assess aortic elasticity. Secondly, aortic distensibility was studied for the ascending and descending thoracic aortas in 26 healthy subjects. Two homogeneous groups were available to evaluate the influence of sex and age (with an age limit value of 35 years). The automatic postprocessing method proved to be robust and reliable enough to automatically determine aortic distensibility, even on artefacted images. In the 26 healthy volunteers, a marked decrease in distensibility appears with age, although this decrease is only significant for the ascending aorta (8. 97 +/- 2. 69 10 (- 3) mmHg(- 1) 5. 97 +/- 2. 02 10 - 3 mmHg(- 1)).

In particular, how majority vote or STAPLE algorithms could improve the final result in terms of accuracy and reproducibility when combining three semi-automatic segmentation algorithms. Methods: Three published approaches of segmentation (contrast-oriented, possibility theory and adaptive thresholding) and two consensus algorithms, majority vote and STAPLE, were implemented in a single software platform (Artiview®). Four clinical datasets including different locations (thorax, breast, abdomen) or pathologies (NSCLC primary tumours, metastasis, lymphoma) were used to evaluate accuracy and reproducibility of the consensus approach in comparison with pathology ground truth or CT – ground truth surrogate. Results: Our results reflect the variable performance of individual segmentation algorithms for lesions of different tumour entities that is for PET images that differ in resolution, contrast and image noise. Independent on location and pathology of the lesion, however, the consensus method displays improved volume segmentation accuracy compared to the worst performing individual method {{in the majority of}} cases and is close to the best performing method in many cases. In addition, the implementation reveals high reproducibility of the segmentation results against small changes in the respective starting conditions. No significant difference between STAPLE and majority vote algorithms was found. Conclusion: This study shows that combining different PET-segmentation methods by application of a consensus algorithm offers robustness against the variable performance of individual segmentation methods and is therefore useful for radiation oncology purposes.

In contrast to <b>automatic</b> <b>contouring,</b> research on visual-manual delineation is scarce. The present study investigates the dependency of manual delineation on experience and qualification. A total of 44 international interdisciplinary observers each defined a [(18) F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) -PET based gross tumor volume (GTV) using the same PET/CT scan from a patient with lung cancer. The observers were "experts" (E; nn=n 3), "experienced interdisciplinary pairs" (EP; 9 teams of radiation oncologist (RO) + nuclear medicine physician (NP)), "single field specialists" (SFS; nn=n 13), and "students" (S; nn=n 10). Five automatic delineation methods (AM) were also included. Volume sizes and concordance indices within the groups (pCI) and relative to the experts (eCI) were calculated. E (pCI =n 0. 67) and EP (pCI =n 0. 53) showed a significantly higher agreement within the groups as compared to SFS (pCI =n 0. 43, pn=n 0. 03, and pn=n 0. 006). In relation to the experts, EP (eCI =n 0. 55) showed better concordance compared to SFS (eCI =n 0. 49) or S (eCI =n 0. 47). The intermethod variability of the AM (pCI =n 0. 44) {{was similar to that}} of SFS and S, showing poorer agreement with the experts (eCI =n 0. 35).

Demons-based deformable registration was performed to find the volumetric mapping from the exhale reference phase to each other phase. Contours were propagated using volumetric methods. Usually, the GTV is contoured on one reference phase (end-exhale for example) of the 4 D-CT which is copied and edited on the others phases. This is a very important, but time consuming task that is inconvenient for every day clinical use. Using a deformation field computed between 4 D-CT phases could accelerate the contouring process. The reference GTV contour would be deformed from one phase to another and the clinician {{would have to do}} only small adjustments. The contouring time spent would be significantly reduced. The question is if deformable registration {{could be used as a}} semi-automatic contouring tool. We compared differences between GTV reported with and without deformation from one 4 D-CT phases to another. Three metrics were used to assess the quality of the contour propagation: the volume intersection and two volume differences. ResultsVolume intersections between manual and <b>automatic</b> <b>contouring</b> were generally between about 85 and 90 per cent, while volume differences were generally between 5 and 15 per cent. Differences between manual and automatic results were correlated with the variability of manual GTV volumes delineation between phases.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityThe theory of stationary stochastic processes in several dimensions has been investigated to provide a general model which may be applied to various problems which involve unknown functions of several variables. In particular, when values of the function are known only at a finite set of points, treating the unknown function as a realisation of a stationary stochastic process leads to an interpolating function which reproduces the values exactly at the given points. With suitable choice of auto-correlation for the model, the interpolating function may also he shown to be continuous in all its derivatives everywhere. A few parameters only need to be found for the interpolator, and these may be estimated from the given data. One problem tackled using such an interpolator is that of <b>automatic</b> <b>contouring</b> of functions of two variables from arbitrarily scattered data points. A "two-stage" model was developed, which incorporates a long-range "trend" component {{as well as a}} shorter-range "residual" term. This leads to a contouring algorithm which gives good results with difficult data. The second area of application is that of optimisation, particularly of objective functions which are expensive to compute. Since the interpolator gives an estimate of the derivatives with little work, it is simple to optimise it using conventional techniques, and to re-evaluate the true function at the apparent optimum point. An iterative algorithm along these lines gives good results with test functions, especially with fuactions of more than two variables. A program has been developed whicj incorporates both the optimisation and contouring applications into a single peckage. Finally, the theory of excursions of a stationary process above a fixed level has been applied to the problem of modelling the occurrence of oilfields, with special reference to their spatial distribution and tendency to cluster.

Methods and Materials: This study included 21 patients who underwent CHOL-PET and T 2 W-/DW-MRI prior to radical prostatectomy. Two observers manually delineated IPL contours for each scan, and automatic IPL contours were generated on CHOL-PET based on varying proportions of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV). IPLs identified on prostatectomy specimens defined the reference standard contours. The imaging-based contours were compared with the reference standard contours using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), sensitivity and specificity. Factors that could potentially predict the DSC of the best contouring method were analyzed using linear models. Results: The best <b>automatic</b> <b>contouring</b> method, SUV 60, had similar correlations (DSC 0. 59) with the manual PET contours (DSC 0. 52, P= 0. 127) and significantly better correlations than the manual MRI contours (DSC 0. 37, P< 0. 001). The sensitivity and specificity values were 72 % and 71 % for SUV 60; 53 % and 86 % for PET manual contouring; and 28 % and 92 % for MRI manual contouring. The tumor volume and transition zone pattern could independently predict the accuracy of CHOL-PET. Conclusions: CHOL-PET is superior to the combination of T 2 W- and DW-MRI for delineating IPLs. The accuracy of CHOL-PET is insufficient for gland-sparing focal therapies, 3 however may be accurate enough for focal boost therapies. The transition zone pattern is a new classification that may predict for how well CHOL-PET delineates IPLs. Joe H. Chang, Daryl Lim Joon, Ian D.

Metabolic activity, as determined by PET imaging, may correlate with the number of viable cancer cells and reflect changes in viable cancer cell volume. However, contouring of PET images by hand is labor intensive and introduces an element of irreproducibility into the determination of functional target/tumor volume (FTV). A computer-assisted method to aid in the <b>automatic</b> <b>contouring</b> of FTV has the potential to substantially improve treatment individualization and outcome assessment. ^ Commercial software to determine FTV in FDG-avid primary and metastatic liver tumors has been evaluated and optimized. Volumes determined using the automated technique were compared to those from manually drawn contours identified using the same cutoff in the standard uptake value (SUV). The reproducibility of FTV is improved through the introduction of an optimal threshold value determined from phantom experiments. Application of the optimal threshold value from the phantom experiments to patient scans was in good agreement with hand-drawn determinations of the FTV. It is concluded that computer-assisted contouring of the FTV for primary and metastatic liver tumors improves reproducibility and increases accuracy, especially when combined with the selection of an optimal SUV threshold determined from phantom experiments. ^ A method to link the pre-treatment assessment of functional (PET based) and anatomical (CT based) parameters to post-treatment survival and time to progression was evaluated in 22 patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases treated using 90 Y microspheres and chemotherapy.

In one case, the SPECT/CT-based LSF was as high as 12.6 % without the exclusion region, but reduced to only 2.2 % with the exclusion region. The patient results show the same trend as in the phantom study with the SPECT/CT-based LSF decreasing with AC and decreasing further with SC. As in the phantom study, in general, the impact of SC was less than the impact of AC, except at low LSFs. However, we believe SC should be performed when available because improved accuracy was shown in the phantom study at zero LSF and can also improve visibility/contrast of extra-hepatic deposition. The difference between LSFs corresponding to planar imaging and SPECT/CT was generally much higher in patients than in the phantom, which can be attributed to the fact that the phantom was not impacted by motion effects and operator variability in defining regions both of which can significantly impact the planar calculation in patients. The planar-based estimate can have considerable variability associated with the manual segmentation of patient liver and lung regions, which is operator-dependent. The operator variability can be all but eliminated with SPECT/CT-based <b>automatic</b> <b>contouring</b> tools, such as those used in the current workflow. Additionally, in patients, the planar LSFs can be affected by extra-hepatic uptake due to breakdown of 99 mTc-MAA over time because unlike with SPECT, planar imaging does not differentiate between activity originating in the source region and originating in overlying and underlying tissue. There can also be scattering off of the structures that are overlying or underlying the source region (for example, liver counts scattering off of breast tissue that is anterior to the lung will contribute to the planar lung counts, but not to the SPECT VOI counts), which can be mitigated by a simple energy window-based scatter correction. In our study, only photopeak window data was available for the clinic planar acquisitions; hence, scatter correction could not be performed. The relative impact of the various effects can be estimated by comparing the LSFs in Tables  2 and 3 with and without the different corrections and the exclusion zone. Based on these results, the use of attenuation correction and the exclusion zone had the biggest impact on SPECT LSF. We were not able to assess the impact of SPECT resolution recovery because all reconstructions included this (no option to turn resolution recovery off in Flash 3 D).|$|E
