5|$|In {{the third}} {{practice}} session on Saturday morning, Sebastian Vettel set the fastest time, about one hundredth {{of a second}} faster than Hamilton. Nico Rosberg and Daniel Ricciardo followed, both also within two tenth of a second of Vettel. Max Verstappen was fifth fastest although he had a minor crash coming up to Casino square, clipping the wall. Toro Rosso were again quick, getting both drivers into the top ten.

5|$|One 30-minute {{practice}} session {{was held on}} Thursday before the two races. Bird, who called the Circuit de Monaco his favourite track in the GP2 Series, was the fastest driver {{with a time of}} one minute and 21.512 seconds on super-soft tyres, 0.057 seconds faster than teammate Tom Dillmann in second. Evans was third-fastest, ahead of Jolyon Palmer. Marcus Ericsson and Johnny Cecotto Jr. were fifth and sixth. Leimer was seventh-fastest, Nasr eighth, Rio Haryanto ninth and Calado completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Only minor off-track excursions were reported with Stéphane Richelmi spinning at La Rascasse corner and stalled in his attempt to continue driving. Nasr narrowly avoided impacting the barriers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Swimming</b> <b>Pool</b> complex and Coletti, Leimer, Calado and Kevin Giovesi all ran deep into the track's run-off areas at various points in the half hour session.|$|E

5|$|The weather {{remained}} hot and dry for the Saturday morning practice sessions. Michael Schumacher was {{the fastest}} {{driver in the}} third session, setting a time of 1:20.762; Barrichello ended with the third quickest lap time. Häkkinen set a time one-tenth of a second slower than Michael Schumacher and was second fastest. Alesi continued to run quicker and was fourth fastest, faster than Coulthard and Frentzen. Irvine, Trulli, Fisichella and Johnny Herbert completed the top ten. In the final practice session, Coulthard was fastest {{with a time of}} 1:20.405 though he ran down the escape road at Ste Devote and his engine subsequently stalled. Michael Schumacher was second fastest, nearly one-tenth slower than Coulthard. Fisichella opted to use a softer damper and set the third quickest lap, in front of Trulli and Häkkinen. Barrichello, Alesi, Wurz, Frentzen and Ralf Schumacher completed the top ten fastest drivers ahead of qualifying. A crash by Irvine <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>swimming</b> <b>pool</b> complex ended his session prematurely.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with six drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. In the first part of qualifying (Q1), the session got interrupted shortly after it had started, as Felipe Nasr came to a halt at the exit of the tunnel, caused by an engine failure. A red flag came out while the car was cleared off the track. When the running resumed, all drivers except for the two at Force India went out on the ultrasoft tyres to set their first lap times. Max Verstappen was the last to set a representative time, but touched the guardrail <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>swimming</b> <b>pool</b> chicane and crashed into the wall, causing another red flag period. As the session got back under way, it were the two Manor cars of Rio Haryanto and Pascal Wehrlein, as well as Jolyon Palmer and Marcus Ericsson who joined Nasr and Verstappen on the sidelines, as they were eliminated. Kevin Magnussen meanwhile barely made it into Q2, but was under investigation for exiting the pit lane while it was closed.|$|E
5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Thursday, and two on Saturday. The Thursday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final {{practice sessions}} were held on Saturday morning and lasted 45 minutes. The Thursday morning and afternoon practice sessions were held in dry and hot weather conditions. Michael Schumacher set the fastest time in the first session, at 1 minute and 23.039 seconds, three-tenths of a second quicker than Häkkinen. Coulthard was third fastest, ahead of Fisichella and Frentzen. Alesi managed sixth despite suffering from gearbox issues which caused him to pull up on the track. Eddie Irvine, Jenson Button, Barrichello and Salo completed the top ten fastest drivers in the session. Minardi's Gastón Mazzacane spun and lost his front right wheel in a crash at turn 17 and Ralf Schumacher made contact with the barrier at turn eight. In the second practice session, Häkkinen set the quickest lap of the day, a 1:21.387; Coulthard finished with the third fastest time. The McLaren drivers were separated by Michael Schumacher. Eddie Irvine was running quicker and was fourth fastest, in front of Frentzen and Ralf Schumacher. Alesi continued to encounter problems though he managed to be seventh quickest. de la Rosa, Trulli and Barrichello followed in the top ten.

5|$|Upon {{her arrival}} to Ramsay Street, Bridget makes friends with Zeke Kinski (Matthew Werkmeister) {{and she joins}} his {{football}} team, despite opposition from bully Justin Hunter (Chris Toohey). Bridget joins Declan Napier when he begins joyriding. During a race with Justin, they are pursued by the police. They return home thinking they escaped, {{only to find the}} police waiting for them. Bridget is banned from seeing Declan, but she sneaks out to meet him at the park, where they argue. On her way home, Bridget trips and falls into the road in front of a car being driven by Susan Kennedy. Susan blacks out, a result of suffering from multiple sclerosis, and hits Bridget. She drives off, unaware of what she has done. Bridget is found and rushed to the hospital, where she undergoes emergency surgery for a bleed on her brain. She remains unconscious, until Rachel Kinski (Caitlin Stasey) visits and pleads with her to wake up. Bridget's hand moves and she awakes the next day. However, she cannot feel anything down the left side of her body and she is told that she could be permanently disabled. Susan realises that she caused the accident and comes forward. She is arrested and put on trial. Bridget remembers that she fell into the road and that the accident was not Susan's fault, and she tells the court. During a rehabilitation class <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>swimming</b> <b>pool,</b> Bridget meets Josh Taylor (Liam Hemsworth). Following a disastrous date with Declan, where Bridget is given the impression that Declan cannot handle her disability, Bridget begins dating Josh. Following a roof collapse at an illegal dance party, Bridget and Josh are both trapped in rubble. Declan carries Josh out before coming back for Bridget. Another collapse traps Declan and Bridget together and Declan tells her that he does not have a problem with her disability. Shortly after, Bridget begins to walk without her walking aid and her mobility returns.|$|E

25|$|Ricciardo {{qualified}} in third, and {{was unable}} to improve on his fastest time after sliding on his final timed lap. His teammate Vettel could not use his energy recovery system {{in the first part of}} qualifying; he ran in a different mode and the yellow flags meant he was restricted to fourth. The two Ferrari cars of Alonso and Räikkönen were fifth and sixth; both had tyre warming problems. Despite his final lap being affected by the yellow flags, Vergne took seventh and his teammate Kvyat secured ninth after struggling with rear-end control and hit the barriers lining the circuit. He drove to the pit lane for a replacement nose cone. They were separated by Magnussen in eighth and Pérez rounded out the top ten after locking his tyres driving into the Novelle chicane. Hülkenberg was the fastest driver not to advance into the final session; his best lap time of one minute and 17.846 second was nearly two seconds slower than Hamilton's pace in the second session. Button was delayed by a Toro Rosso on his final lap <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Swimming</b> <b>Pool</b> complex and was restricted to 12th. Bottas had front tyre heating problems and was only able to qualify 13th. Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado in the two Lotus cars took 14th and 15th with Massa unable to record a lap time. Ericsson locked his rear tyres going into Mirabeau corner and glanced Massa's car heading into the turn, causing both drivers to hit the barriers. The stewards investigated the incident and Ericsson was handed two penalty points on his super licence and was required to start from the pit lane. Gutiérrez failed to advance beyond the first qualifying session, and was followed by Sauber teammate Adrian Sutil. Jules Bianchi lost half a second because of slower traffic and yellow flags and took 19th. He received a five-place grid penalty, because his team changed a problematic gearbox overnight. As a result, his Marussia teammate Chilton inherited 19th. Kamui Kobayashi used super soft compound tyres on his first two timed laps and made a front wing adjustment but {{was unable to}} improve and qualified in 20th.|$|E

500|$|Reflections from {{athletes and}} {{officials}} provide {{an insight into}} {{the value of this}} inaugural event. Bill Mather-Brown, an Australian athlete, said [...] "The 1962 Games was the first time I had been asked for an autograph. We regarded it as a compliment.

500|$|The {{drowning}} {{scene and}} house exteriors were filmed in Hertfordshire {{at the home}} of actor David Tree, who also plays the headmaster at the son's boarding school. Shooting the sequence was particularly problematic: Sharon Williams, who played Christine, became hysterical when submersed in the pond, despite the rehearsals <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>swimming</b> <b>pool</b> going well. [...] A farmer on the neighbouring land volunteered his daughter who was an accomplished swimmer, but who refused to be submersed when it came to filming. In the end, the scene was filmed in a water tank using three girls. Nicolas Roeg and editor Graeme Clifford showed the opening sequence to some friends before filming resumed on the Venice segment, and Clifford recalls it making a considerable impression.|$|E
500|$|The Back to the Future trilogy is parodied and {{referenced}} {{throughout the}} episode, {{along with many}} other movies and famous people throughout the 1980s. Other cultural references include how after going back in time, Peter becomes excited about his new prospects in life, and states to Cleveland {{that he is going to}} [...] "raise more hell than Hellraiser" [...] from the 1987 horror film Hellraiser. It also depicts Pinhead as weak and ridiculous, stating that the worst he can do is unscrew a salt shaker and trick someone into using it, causing salt to come out all over their food. The first scene where Lois appears <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>swimming</b> <b>pool</b> is a reference to a scene from the 1980 film Caddyshack, featuring the song [...] "Mr. Night" [...] by Kenny Loggins. Once Lois appears, she asks Peter if he would like to see the 1982 film Zapped!. Rejecting her offer, Peter decides to go partying with Cleveland instead and play the video game Menstrual Ms. Pac-Man, in addition to making out with actress Molly Ringwald. While there, Brian gets into a fight, and instructs the bar patron to meet him on top of the World Trade Center to fight him at eight A.M. on September 11, 2001. While downstairs in the alternate universe, Peter makes a reference to the Twilight Zone episode, [...] "The Eye of the Beholder." [...] The joke about the World Trade Center has been edited from current versions of the show accessible on Netflix as of January 2012. Returning to the present, Peter and Brian decide to watch television, and are shocked to discover that actor Chevy Chase is now the host of The Tonight Show. They also discover that former Vice President Al Gore is now President of the United States, and flying cars running on vegetable oil exist. A parody of the 1962 ABC animated series, Hanna-Barbera's The Jetsons, is then shown. In the alternate reality, Death refers to the Dick Cheney hunting accident, explaining that the [...] "Chairman of Halliburton" [...] accidentally shot and killed Karl Rove, Antonin Scalia, and Tucker Carlson (Brian groans that Peter and he can't change this wonderful future, but Peter flatly says [...] "I don't know who any of those people are"). The main plot of the episode, complete with the scene in which Peter and Brian are in the living room, with Brian explaining to Peter what happened using a chalk board, is a reference to the alternate universe scene in Back to the Future Part II.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{open-circuit}} scuba {{system was}} devised in 1925 by Yves Le Prieur in France. Inspired {{by the simple}} apparatus of Maurice Fernez and the freedom it allowed the diver, he conceived an idea to make it free of the tube to the surface pump by using Michelin cylinders as the air supply, containing three litres of air compressed to [...] The [...] "Fernez-Le Prieur" [...] diving apparatus was demonstrated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>swimming</b> <b>pool</b> of Tourelles in Paris in 1926. The unit consisted of a cylinder of compressed air carried {{on the back of}} the diver, connected to a pressure regulator designed by Le Prieur adjusted manually by the diver, with two gauges, one for tank pressure and one for output (supply) pressure. Air was supplied continually to the mouthpiece and ejected through a short exhaust pipe fitted with a valve as in the Fernez design, however, the lack of a demand regulator and the consequent low endurance of the apparatus limited the practical use of LePrieur's device.|$|E
2500|$|On another occasion, South African swimmer Roland Schoeman {{came under}} {{criticism}} when {{he referred to}} the crowd at the swimming as [...] "going on like monkeys" [...] in a post-race poolside interview. Schoeman's remarks came after he narrowly avoided being disqualified as he and England's Simon Burnett fell in {{at the start of the}} 50m freestyle when distracted by crowd noise. The swimming has been persistently affected by Indian spectators ignoring etiquette and shouting out while the competitors were preparing for the start. His comment was regarded as possibly being a racial ethnic slur, although he later said that the word was commonly used in South Africa to refer to mischievous behaviour. At an official press conference, organising committee secretary-general Lalit Bhanot took the complaints about monkeys literally. Not being aware of the complaints, Bhanot felt Delhi's wildlife was at issue: [...] "We know especially <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>swimming</b> <b>pool</b> there are a lot of monkeys and we have made efforts to keep them away from the swimming pool." ...|$|E
2500|$|Di Grassi {{narrowed the}} gap to Buemi {{to half a}} second with six laps remaining. Wwhile {{thinking}} about an overtaking attempt on Buemi, both men were delayed by slower traffic, causing di Grassi to drop back. Buemi had less available electrical energy than di Grassi which allowed his rival to run close behind him. Although di Grassi {{had been unable to}} use FanBoost because of battery voltage limitations, he was able to draw closer to Buemi on the final lap. He forced Buemi to defend his position <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Swimming</b> <b>Pool</b> complex and La Rascasse corner, but could not find the space to get ahead as run to the start/finish line was not long enough, allowing Buemi to fend him off and win the race. Di Grassi finished 0.320 seconds adrift in second with Heidfeld clinching third. Heidfeld thus became the first driver to stand on the Monaco podium in both Formula One and Formula E. Piquet, Engel, Rosenqvist and Abt all finished close behind each other in positions four to seven. with Gutiérrez, Prost and Evans rounding out the top ten points-scoring finishers. Félix da Costa was adjudged to have been unsafely released from his garage and was handed a 33-second time penalty which demoted him from ninth to 11th. His teammate Frijns was running in eighth in the closing stages but lost all electrical energy on the final lap and fell to 12th. Turvey, Carroll and Sarrazin were the last of the classified finishers. It was Buemi's fourth victory of the season, his second consecutive in Monaco, and the tenth of his career. Of the other retirements, d'Ambrosio and Duval returned to the track but both retired with the former suffering from a powertrain malfunction and the latter was affected by regenerative braking problems, and both Virgin cars were not classified in the final results.|$|E
