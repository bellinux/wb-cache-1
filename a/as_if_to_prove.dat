5|$|Politically, Crease {{presented}} {{himself as a}} foe of the Hudson's Bay Company's hegemony over the colony, and in 1860 {{was elected to the}} Vancouver Island House of Assembly as an independent member representing Victoria. However, he was soon criticised by the British Colonist (a paper run by opposition leader Amor de Cosmos) for being too cozy with the HBC-backed government. The following year, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> de Cosmos right, governor Sir James Douglas appointed Crease Attorney-General of British Columbia, and Crease resigned his seat in the Assembly. He was a key member of the government, responsible for pushing literally hundreds of laws through the legislature, in between his continuing circuit tours, most of which was concerned with regulating the resource-based economic activity of the colony, including land settlement and gold mining. His legislation cemented his reputation as an advocate of free trade.|$|E

Poirot also asks if she has met a Mr Cole at the sanctuary. Miss Carnaby has and to her he is a very strange man. <b>As</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> her assertion correct, soon afterwards Mr Cole accosts Miss Carnaby with tales of his strange visions which involve sacrifices, Jehovah, and even Odin. She is saved from further strange tales by the arrival of Mr Lipscombe, the lodge-keeper of the Devonshire estate.|$|E
2500|$|In July {{the pace}} of arrests and charges more than doubled, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> {{there had been a}} large insurrection that needed controlling. But, the court [...] "found it {{difficult}} to get conclusive evidence." [...] It noted in its report covering the second round of court proceedings, that three men sentenced to death implicated [...] "scores of others" [...] when they were promised leniency in punishment.|$|E

50|$|Jimi Hendrix: His death {{marks the}} family's arrival to San Francisco, Voltaire idolizes {{him to the}} point of {{lighting}} his guitar on fire and he is featured in two dream-like scenes, sitting in a café and speaking with Rocky and Elvis in a rather disconnected manner about music and their lives. In the first scene, occurring before the move to New York, Rocky and Elvis speak <b>as</b> <b>if</b> trying <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> their worth. In the second, after the birth of Venus, Rocky and Elvis are more respectful.|$|R
5000|$|Music {{critics were}} divided on [...] "Alone." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic picked the song {{as one of}} the best tracks on Taking Chances, and wrote that [...] "Celine {{attempts}} to snatch Heart's 'Alone' from Carrie Underwood and cribs from Kelly Clarkson's operatic rock, two blatant thieveries that, when combined with the quartet of explicit changeups, gives Taking Chances a vaguely desperate vibe, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Celine needs <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that she still reigns supreme among all divas." [...] Sarah Rodman wrote for The Boston Globe that [...] "Enlisting former Evanescence guitarist Ben Moody adds little; in fact, the carbon-copy arrangement doesn't pack as much windswept melodramatic punch as Dion's own 'It's All Coming Back to Me Now.' Great vocal, terrific melody, a fine rendition, but 'Alone' is already indelibly stamped by Heart's Ann Wilson." [...] Toronto Star editor Ashante Infantry called this song [...] "sentimental, cringe-worthy diva track." [...] Chuck Taylor of Billboard called it [...] "a rowdy cover." [...] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone gave the song a negative review, writing: [...] "That's nothing compared to Dion shrieking the ten millionth version of Heart's 'Alone' (mad pitchy, dog!), produced by ex-Evanescence guitarist Ben Moody - Amy Lee, meet the fugliest bullet you ever dodged." ...|$|R
2500|$|Buck himself sized up CBS' {{handling}} of the announcers by saying [...] "CBS never got that baseball play-by-play draws word-pictures. All they knew was that football stars analysts. So they said, 'Let [...] McCarver run the show.' In television, all {{they want you to}} do is shut up. I'm not very good at shutting up." [...] Buck though, would add that although he knew Tim McCarver well, they never developed a good relationship with each other on the air despite high hopes to the contrary. Phil Mushnick added insult to injury to Buck by accusing him of [...] "trying to predict plays, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> he was still on top." ...|$|E
2500|$|The movie Saaz was {{supposedly}} based on Lata and Asha's rivalry. Asha {{said about the}} movie– [...] "To have two women in long plaits, {{take a couple of}} incidents and exaggerate them into a 3-hour film is such a waste of time." [...] In the last few years, Asha and Lata have often been seen in public, enjoying each other's company. In an interview with The Times of India, Asha once said– [...] "I remember, sometimes both of us would be at a function and some industry types would ignore me and interact only with her, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> their loyalty. Later, didi and I would have a good laugh!" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Freedom '90" [...] was {{the second}} of only two of its singles to be {{supported}} by a music video (the other being the Michael-less [...] "Praying for Time"). The song alludes to his struggles with his artistic identity, and prophesied his efforts shortly thereafter to end his recording contract with Sony Music. <b>As</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the song's sentiment, Michael refused {{to appear in the}} video (directed by David Fincher), and instead recruited supermodels Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Tatjana Patitz, and Cindy Crawford to appear in and lip sync in his stead. It also featured the reduction of his sex symbol status. It had a No. 8 success on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US, and No. 28 on the UK Singles Chart.|$|E
2500|$|Baudrillard's provocative 1991 book The Gulf War Did Not Take Place {{raised his}} public profile as an {{academic}} and political commentator. He argued that the first Gulf War was the inverse of the Clausewitzian formula: not [...] "the continuation of politics by other means", but [...] "the continuation {{of the absence of}} politics by other means". Accordingly, Saddam Hussein was not fighting the Coalition, but using the lives of his soldiers as a form of sacrifice to preserve his power (p.72, 2004 edition). The Coalition fighting the Iraqi military was merely dropping 10,000 tonnes of bombs daily, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>proving</b> <b>to</b> themselves that there was an enemy to fight (p.61). So, too, were the Western media complicit, presenting the war in real time, by recycling images of war to propagate the notion that the U.S.-led coalition and the Iraqi government were actually fighting, but, such was not the case. Saddam Hussein did not use his military capacity (the Iraqi Air Force). His power was not weakened, evinced by his easy suppression of the 1991 internal uprisings that followed afterwards. Overall, little had changed. Saddam remained undefeated, the [...] "victors" [...] were not victorious, and thus there was no war—i.e., the Gulf War did not occur.|$|R

2500|$|A lengthy {{obituary}} {{devoted to}} Bishop White in the National Gazette and Literary Register described him thus: [...] "...he {{duties of the}} several important relations in which he stood to society were performed with undeviating correctness and suavity; he possessed the rare merit of winning the respect and love of an entire community {{to which he was}} an ornament and a blessing. [...] His piety was deep and unfeigned; his walking humble yet dignified; his acquirements profound; in his mind the welfare of the Christian church was always the prominent consideration...He was one of those examples of steady virtue sent upon earth by Divine providence, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> how near the great pattern of perfection it is permitted to approach." ...|$|E
2500|$|As she promised, on {{the second}} week's program, the guests were Groucho Marx, Jane Powell, Ezio Pinza and Fanny Brice, along with Hanley Stafford, Frank Lovejoy, David Brian and John Agar (the latter three recreating their screen roles in {{highlights}} from their current Warner Bros. picture, Breakthrough). The early shows were successful, and the program stayed on Sunday nights from 6:00-7:30pm ET for its first season, shifting to 6:30-8:00pm ET in its second. NBC went full-throttle {{in an attempt to}} keep radio from its predicted death, and The Big Show was thought to be a key to that effort. Newsweek stated it was [...] "the biggest bang to hit radio since TV started." [...] <b>As</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> big bang and big bucks were mutual partners, some $100,000 could be budgeted for a single installment.|$|E
2500|$|During 1988, Arena {{appeared}} as a guest on Australian TV shows recalling her tenure on Young Talent Time {{and looking for a}} new record label. In 1990 she had a singing and dancing role in the David Atkins' musical, Dynamite, for a 10-month run. Also that year she signed with EMI and reinvented her image as a raunchy disco diva. In April she issued a single, [...] "I Need Your Body", which peaked at No.3 on the ARIA Singles Chart. McFarlane described it as [...] "uptempo" [...] with the associated music video [...] "projecting a raunchy disco-diva persona... flaunting a pouting rock starlet with bouncing cleavage and attitude to burn." [...] Australian journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, noticed that she used [...] "raunchy videos showing off her cleavage <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> she was a woman now." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{choosing}} the Yankee dialect, I {{did not act}} without forethought. It had long {{seemed to me that}} the great vice of American writing and speaking was a studied want of simplicity, that we were in danger of coming to look on our mother-tongue as a dead language, to be sought in the grammar and dictionary rather than in the heart, and that our only chance of escape was by seeking it at its living sources among those who were, as Scottowe says of Major-General Gibbons, 'divinely illiterate.' President Lincoln, the only really great public man whom these latter days have seen, was great also in this, that he was master--witness his speech at Gettysburg--of a truly masculine English, classic, because it was of no special period, and level at once to the highest and lowest of his countrymen. I learn from the highest authority that his favorite reading was in Shakespeare and Milton, to which, of course, the Bible should be added. But whoever should read the debates in Congress might fancy himself present {{at a meeting of the}} city council of some city of Southern Gaul in the decline of the Empire, where barbarians with a Latin varnish emulated each other in being more than Ciceronian. Whether it be want of culture, for the highest outcome of that is simplicity, or for whatever reason, it is certain that very few American writers or speakers wield their native language with the directness, precision, and force that are common as the day in the mother country. We use it like Scotsmen, not <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it belonged <b>to</b> us, but <b>as</b> <b>if</b> we wished <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that we belonged to it, by showing our intimacy with its written rather than with its spoken dialect. And yet all the while our popular idiom is racy with life and vigor and originality, bucksome (as Milton used the word) to our new occasions, and proves itself no mere graft by sending up new suckers from the old root in spite of us. It is only from its roots in the living generations of men that a language can be reinforced with fresh vigor for its needs; what may be called a literate dialect grows ever more and more pedantic and foreign, till it becomes at last as unfitting a vehicle for living thought as monkish Latin. That we should all be made to talk like books is the danger with which we are threatened by the Universal Schoolmaster, who does his best to enslave the minds and memories of his victims to what he esteems the best models of English composition, that is to say, to the writers whose style is faultily correct and has no blood-warmth in it. No language after it has faded into diction, none that cannot suck up the feeding juices secreted for it in the rich mother-earth of common folk, can bring forth a sound and lusty book. True vigor and heartiness of phrase do not pass from page to page, but from man to man, where the brain is kindled and the lips suppled by downright living interests and by passion in its very throe. Language is the soil of thought, and our own especially is a rich leaf-mould, the slow deposit of ages, the shed foliage of feeling, fancy, and imagination, which has suffered an earth-change, that the vocal forest, as Howell called it, may clothe itself anew with living green. There is death in the dictionary; and, where language is too strictly limited by convention, the ground for expression to grow in is limited also; and we get a potted literature, Chinese dwarfs instead of healthy trees.|$|R

2500|$|In 1925, he {{produced}} House by the Railroad. This classic work depicts an isolated Victorian wood mansion, partly {{obscured by the}} raised embankment of a railroad. It marked Hopper's artistic maturity. Lloyd Goodrich praised the work as [...] "one of the most poignant and desolating pieces of realism." [...] The work {{is the first of}} a series of stark rural and urban scenes that uses sharp lines and large shapes, played upon by unusual lighting to capture the lonely mood of his subjects. Although critics and viewers interpret meaning and mood in these cityscapes, Hopper insisted [...] "I was more interested in the sunlight on the buildings and on the figures than any symbolism." [...] <b>As</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the point, his late painting Sun in an Empty Room (1963) is a pure study of sunlight.|$|E
