40|$|We {{simulated}} {{the million}} degree interstellar medium and its soft X-ray {{images in the}} disk and halo of spiral galaxies using the bipolar hypershell (BHS) model. In this model hourglass-shaped expanding shells of several kpc radii are produced by a sudden energy release in the central region. We then applied our model to a mini-sample of starburst galaxies seen under different inclinations suhc as the nearly edge-on galaxies NGC 253. Our results reproduce the X-ray characteristics observed in the 0. 1 [...] 2. 4 keV ROSAT energy band: The bipolar hypershell morphology, the spectral energy distribution of the diffuse disk and halo emission as well as absorption gaps in the diffuse X-ray emission caused by a shadowing of soft X-rays due to cold intervening gas in the disks of the galaxies. The required total energy for the starburst {{is estimated to be}} of the order of 10 ^ 55 ergs, corresponding to the overall kinetic energy generated in ∼ 10 ^ 4 type-II supernova explosions. The expansion velocity of the shells is estimated to be ∼ 200, which is necessary to heat the gas to ∼ 0. 2 keV (2. 3 million K), and the <b>age</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> the order of 3 × 10 ^ 7 years. In the case of the very nearby galaxy NGC 253 all characteristics of the BHS model can be studied with high spatial resolution. Using the property that the shell morphology is sensitive to the ambient density distribution, we propose using soft X-ray data to probe the gas distributions in the disk, halo and intergalactic space. The application of our model to images at higher spatial and spectral resolution, as provided by Chandra and XMM, will help us to further disentangle the ISM density distributions and will lead {{to a better understanding of}} the disk halo interface.

40|$|Introduction: Patients {{with chronic}} kidney disease <b>are</b> found <b>to</b> have {{relatively}} more atherosclerosis and calcifications of atherosclerosis, compared to the general population. This might be caused by disorders of the mineral metabolism.

The calcifications are also found in, for example, the renal arteries. The meaning of these renal artery calcifications (RAC) are less known. The purpose <b>of</b> this study <b>is</b> <b>to</b> evaluate if {{there might be an}} association between {{chronic kidney disease}} and RAC. Material & methods: This study included 211 patients, with various renal function. The renal arteries were scored for calcifications. Furthermore, data were registered about age, gender, blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, smoking, body mass index and the laboratory values of creatinine, calcium, phosphate and parathyroid hormone. Results: The prevalence of significant RAC in this study is 47, 4 %. This percentage varied between groups, with significant differences. The prevalence varies between 32, 6 % within the group of patients with normal renal function, and 69, 8 % within the group of patients with an estimated renal function of less than 15 ml/minute.

Functional aids were used by 27. 7 %, 37. 3 % and 65. 9 % of women and 15. 6 %, 33. 4 % and 59. 1 % of men in the respective age groups. Conclusion: Arthritis and rheumatism were the most prevalent chronic conditions among elderly people in the community, and were significantly associated with difficulty with performing activities of daily living, after controlling for effects of age, sex and other chronic conditions...|$|R
40|$|Major {{contributions}} from pathogen genome analysis and host genetics have equated {{the possibility of}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis co-evolution with its human host leading to more stable sympatric host-pathogen relationships. However, the attribution to either sympatric or allopatric categories depends on the resolution or grain of genotypic characterization. We explored the influence on the sympatric host-pathogen relationship of clinical (HIV infection and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis [MDRTB]) and demographic (gender and age) factors {{in regards to the}} genotypic grain by using spacer oligonucleotide typing (spoligotyping) for classification of M. tuberculosis strains within the Euro-American lineage. We analyzed a total of 547 tuberculosis (TB) cases, from six year consecutive sampling in a setting with high TB-HIV coinfection (32. 0 %). Of these, 62. 0 % were caused by major circulating pathogen genotypes. The sympatric relationship <b>was</b> defined according <b>to</b> spoligotype in comparison to the international spoligotype database SpolDB 4. While no significant association with Euro-American lineage was observed with any of the factors analyzed, increasing the resolution with spoligotyping evidenced a significant association of MDRTB with sympatric strains, regardless of the HIV status. Furthermore, distribution curves of the prevalence of sympatric and allopatric TB in relation <b>to</b> patients' <b>age</b> showed an accentuation of the relevance of the age of onset in the allopatric relationship, as reflected in the trimodal distribution. On the contrary, sympatric TB was characterized by the tendency towards a typical (standard) distribution curve. Our results suggest that within the Euro-American lineage a greater degree <b>of</b> genotyping fine-tuning <b>is</b> necessary in modeling the biological processes behind the host-pathogen interplay. Furthermore, prevalence distribution <b>of</b> sympatric TB <b>to</b> <b>age</b> <b>was</b> suggestive <b>of</b> host genetic determinisms driven by more common variants.

40|$|Osteoporosis {{is known}} as the silent disease as it is often not {{diagnosed}} until an individual presents with a low impact fracture. Many people <b>of</b> all <b>ages</b> appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unaware <b>of</b> the risk factors and preventive behaviours. Adolescence <b>is</b> a period <b>of</b> significant growth and change. It is during this time that the majority <b>of</b> bone mass <b>is</b> accumulated. Education <b>to</b> increase awareness of risk factors and preventive behaviours is identified as being paramount in helping to prevent the onset of this disease later in life. Studies reveal that adolescent diets are frequently lacking in calcium intake and levels <b>of</b> physical activity <b>are</b> lower than is recommended. These are two lifestyle factors that can help to improve bone density. Education on these factors can contribute significantly to reducing the risk of developing osteoporosis. Results: The review indicates that there <b>are</b> poor levels <b>of</b> knowledge regarding osteoporosis among the adolescent population group. There are a small number of studies that include the older adolescent in the assessment of knowledge and even fewer studies that solely focus only on adolescents. Some studies include assessment of health beliefs and behaviours and in most cases an educational intervention has not lead to significant changes in these. In New Zealand, there have been no studies that examine the question of osteoporosis knowledge among adolescents. Only one study that was based in New Zealand was found that looked at the question of osteoporosis knowledge and this was in a group older than adolescents. There are {{only a limited number of}} educational programmes available for the adolescent group. Most <b>of</b> these have <b>been</b> developed overseas. An evaluation of internet resources has demonstrated that these are not necessarily suitable in the reading level and the level of information provided. Some resources are available in New Zealand although there appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> little in the literature that supports the use of these...|$|R
40|$|One {{apparent}} consequence <b>of</b> <b>aging</b> appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> loss <b>of</b> {{some aspects}} of cognitive control. This loss is measurable as early as mid-adulthood. Since, like many aspects <b>of</b> cognition, there <b>is</b> wide variance among individuals, {{it is possible that}} behavior, such as one’s diet, could drive some of these differences. For instance, past data on older humans and non-human primates have suggested that dietary carotenoids could slow cognitive decline. In this study, we tested how early such protection might manifest by examining a sample (n = 60) of 25 – 45 year olds. Carotenoid status was assessed by directly measuring macular pigment optical density (MPOD) which has shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> highly correlated with the primary carotenoid in brain, lutein. Cognitive control was measured using event-related potentials during the performance of cognitive control tasks designed to tap into different aspects of attentional (i. e., selective attention, attentional inhibition, and response inhibition) control. Our results showed that, across participants, MPOD <b>was</b> related <b>to</b> both <b>age</b> and the P 3 component of participants’ neuroelectric profile (P 3 amplitude) for attentional, but not response, inhibition. Although younger adults exhibited larger P 3 amplitudes than their older adult counterparts, older subjects with higher MPOD levels displayed P 3 indices similar to their younger adult counterparts in amplitude. Furthermore, hierarchical regression analyses showed that age was no longer a significant predictor of P 3 amplitude when MPOD was included as a predictor in the model, suggesting that MPOD may partially contribute to the relationship between age and P 3 amplitude. In addition, age and MPOD <b>were</b> shown <b>to</b> have independent associations with intraindividual variability of attentional control, such that younger individuals and individuals with higher MPOD showed less intraindividual variability. These results show a relationship between retinal carotenoids and neuroelectric indices underlying cognitive control. The protective role of carotenoids within the CNS may be evident during early and middle adulthood, decades prior to the onset of older age...|$|R
40|$|Optimization {{of total}} body irradiation: the match between (maximal) leukemic cell kill and (minimal) late effects: In this thesis, {{cataract}} formation and renal dysfunction as late effects of high-dose {{total body irradiation}} (TBI) {{as part of the}} conditioning before hematological stem cell transplantation (HSCT), are considered in more detail. Discussed are factors influencing their appearance. In case of cataract formation, the final severity of the lesion and resulting complaints are described. Also possibilities to prevent severe cataracts, late renal dysfunction and late effects of high-dose TBI for HSCT in general are investigated or discussed. With respect to cataract formation, the values of the tissue specific parameter, alpha/beta, and the rate of repair of sublethal damage, mu, for lens tissue are derived. They were unknown yet and <b>are</b> required <b>to</b> calculate the cataract incidence for a specific TBI regimen, using the linear-quadratic (LQ) concept to normalize the TBI regimens into biologic effective doses (BEDs). Furthermore, to find the requirements for an optimal TBI regimen with maximal leukemic cell kill and minimal late effects, a study was performed comparing the results of various TBI regimens obtained from a literature search. Finally, the results of HSCT/TBI in the Netherlands are discussed, with special attention for the effectiveness of the various TBI regimens as part of the conditioning for HSCT, while also the effects of other variables, such as patient age, gender and type <b>of</b> transplantation, <b>are</b> investigated. Conclusions are: After single-dose or two-fractions TBI, a cataract will develop in 100 % of the patients. Only about 45 % of those patients experience severe visual impairment (SVI), requiring cataract surgery. Steroids shorten the latency time of a cataract and adversely influence the severity. In children, eye shielding during TBI reduced the incidence of SVI to 3 % and did not increase the risk for relapse. An alpha/beta of 0. 75 Gy and a mu of 0. 65 h- 1 were found. Unexpectedly, late renal dysfunction after TBI <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a risk <b>of</b> almost all TBI regimens, even when multifractionated. Shielding of the kidneys therefore seems unavoidable. As leukemic cells are also present in the shadow of shielding blocks and the measure <b>of</b> shielding can <b>be</b> considerably lower in multifractionated TBI, fractionation of the TBI should be preferred. From analysis of literature-derived data we found that the BED for leukemic cells of an optimal TBI regimen is as high as possible: > 15 Gy, while BEDs for lung kidney and eye lens tissue are not exceeding 15, 17 and 45 Gy, respectively. In The Netherlands, using one- or two-fraction TBI, a regimen with a high BED does not result in a better survival than a regimen with a relatively low BED. Only the non-relapse mortality (NRM) and the relapse incidence (RI) differ. <b>Age</b> appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> significant influence on survival and NRM in favor of younger patients, there was no influence on RI. Gender <b>was</b> also <b>of</b> significant influence on survival and NRM, in favor of male patients; transplantation type (autologous or allogeneic HSCT) <b>was</b> not <b>of</b> influence on survival...|$|R
