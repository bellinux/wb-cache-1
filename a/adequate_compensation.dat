25|$|In March 1921, {{the plans}} for a {{plebiscite}} were abandoned. Neither Lithuania, which was afraid of a negative result, nor Poland, which {{saw no reason to}} change status quo, wanted the plebiscite. The parties could not agree in which territory to carry out the vote and how Żeligowski's forces should be replaced by League's forces. The League of Nations then moved on from trying to solve the narrow territorial dispute in the Vilnius Region to shaping the fundamental relationship between Poland and Lithuania. During 1921, Belgian Paul Hymans suggested several Polish–Lithuanian federation models, all rejected by both sides. In January 1922, parliamentary election to the Wilno Diet (Sejm wileński) resulted in a landslide Polish victory. In its first session on February 20, 1922, the Diet voted for incorporation into Poland as the Wilno Voivodeship. Polish Sejm accepted the resolution of the Diet. The League of Nations ended its efforts to mediate the dispute. After Lithuanians seized the Klaipėda Region in January 1923, the League saw recognition of Lithuanian interest in Klaipėda as <b>adequate</b> <b>compensation</b> for the loss of Vilnius. The League accepted the status quo in February 1923 by dividing the neutral zone and setting a demarcation line, which was recognized in March 1923 as the official Polish–Lithuanian border. Lithuania did not recognize this border.|$|E
25|$|However, {{a series}} of {{problems}} {{have been associated with}} dams on the Salween. The Salween is one of the longest free-flowing rivers in Southeast Asia and is one of only two major free-flowing rivers in China. The river supports thousands of species of plants and animals and is vital to the livelihoods of the many native cultures that live alongside it. It provides water for approximately 7-10 million people and supplies irrigation water to low-lying rice paddies abutting the Andaman Sea. Creating dams on the Salween would involve flooding hundreds of villages and towns and the reduced flow on the lower Salween would cause seawater to infiltrate inland, making the lower Salween valley unsuitable for growing crops. Because of poor logging practices in the upstream watershed, the historically silty Salween has become many times as turbid as its natural state. A reservoir on the Salween would fill much faster than projected, reducing the overall lifespan of dam projects. One of the largest problems is also that the dams would not have much positive impact on the people that actually live in the Salween region. There have been many public outcries to damming the Salween, ranging from petitioning to large-scale protests. There is also controversy over the representation of local opinion in the media. Investigative journalist Liu Jianqiang found little support for the dam projects among locals in China, who feared they would not get <b>adequate</b> <b>compensation.</b>|$|E

The Birmingham company agreed, but imposed heavy tolls on traffic using the junction, {{to compensate for}} the loss of revenue of goods which would formerly have travelled via Aldersely Junction. Lord Dudley agreed to sell his tunnel to the Dudley Canal Company, but never received any payment, as the beneficial tolls and usefulness of the new canal were deemed to be <b>adequate</b> <b>compensation.</b> An Act of Parliament was obtained in July 1785 to authorise the work, which had been surveyed by John Snape and John Bull, and checked by Dadford, who then became consulting engineer.

2500|$|In June 1918, McKenzie sought {{approval}} from the trustees to raise revenue by using Fisk's campus as a receiving station for Black troops in the Student Army Training Corps (SATC), a precursor to the present-day Reserve Officers' Training Corp (ROTC) program. The Student Army Training Corp allowed students to attend school while they participated in military training exercises during World War I. McKenzie noted that accommodating the troops, [...] "will cramp us very considerably, but the compensation will keep us from any additional indebtedness and probably turn our lodging and boarding department into a self-supporting institution, and enable us to make a number of necessary changes or improvements without cutting into our normal funds. I am glad, too, to be of very direct service to the nation in its persecution of the War." [...] In August 1918, the first of over 600 Black SATC cadets arrived in Nashville. [...] "The boys will live a highly educational military life, centered about Bennett Hall. The girls will live an equally efficient, busy school life, centered about Jubilee Hall," [...] he stated. However the presence of military cadets on Fisk's campus, {{all of whom were}} young men, added to the University's disciplinary problems. While McKenzie appreciated the disciplinary focus of the military's proscribed daily routine, he harshly criticized the military's refusal to acknowledge and abide by Fisk's rules and regulations. At the opening of the 1918 academic year, McKenzie set the tone for a new approach to student conduct by invoking the military's presence and influence on the campus, [...] "We are a military institution. Not that we have been absorbed by the military, but that the essential principles of efficiency exemplified in the military have been absorbed into the university. These principles include concentration of effort, unremitting toil, elimination of all unnecessary activities and motions, regular and insistent schedule of life, promptness, accuracy, reliability thoroughness, instant and complete obedience. With military leaders unwilling to enforce [...] "satisfactory moral standards," [...] their cadets ran rampant, smoking, cursing, and fraternizing with Fisk co-eds. In one significant infraction, a soldier helped a female Fisk student to [...] "escape supervision" [...] of the University and was found with her in a private room. Although the man was arrested, the military administered no punishment. In addition to the poor behavior of cadets, McKenzie strongly criticized the federal government for failing to provide Black soldiers <b>adequate</b> <b>compensation</b> for their service to the nation. [...] "When the immediate aim of efficient fighters was no longer its aim, the Government sought to free itself from its financial obligations and forgot what havoc it would work in the lives of many, many young men," [...] McKenzie lamented in the Fisk News. While the mobilization effort only lasted a few months and World War I ended in November 1918, the military presence had lasting effects on Fisk's campus school discipline. McKenzie continued to experiment the military's model of conduct, but the continued military discipline for student conduct policies after the military's departure from campus angered Fisk students. Viewing the new policies as infringing on their rights, several Fisk students rebelled. McKenzie reported, [...] "The other day the college boys served notice on me that until I was inclined to treat them like men they would refuse to attend the study hall. It did not take very many hours to secure written pledges from all but five of them that they would attend. Since then, one or more of them have attempted to spoil the lights in the study hall, and they have torn down the picture of President Cravath and written an ugly message on the chapel wall where the picture was. McKenzie noted the required study hall also angered certain Fisk alumni, remarking [...] "Only last night I was sent almost direct word to the effect that the alumni would protest against the study hall, and a reminder of the fact that practically no white man is trusted by any Negro." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of green public {{procurement}} (governments’ purchases) of certified wood in the EU.

The outcome of the analysis demonstrates that green public procurement of certified wood in one region can create a trade barrier for other regions and decrease other regions’ economic welfare.

40|$|Abstract The {{variability}} {{presented in}} unconstrained environments {{represents one of}} the open challenges in automated face recognition systems. Several techniques have been proposed in the literature to cope with this problem, most of them tai-lored to compensate one specific source of variability, e. g., illumination or pose. In this paper we present a general variability compensation scheme based on the Nui-sance Attribute Projection (NAP) that can be applied to compensate for any kind of variability factors that affects the face recognition performance. Our technique reduces the intra-class variability by finding a low dimensional variability subspace. This approach is assessed on a database from the NIST still face recognition chal-lenge "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly " (GBU). The results achieved using our implementation of a state-of-the-art system based on sparse representation are im-proved significantly by incorporating our variability compensation technique. These results are also compared to the GBU challenge results, highlighting the benefits of <b>adequate</b> variability <b>compensation</b> schemes in these kind of uncontrolled environ-ments. ...|$|R
