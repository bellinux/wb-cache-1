40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the effect of value-added tax on small to medium-sized developers of residential properties in South Africa. Firstly, the way value-added tax is applied to residential properties in South Africa was established. It was ascertained that no special concessions exist with regard to housing. Secondly, the application of value-added tax to residential properties in the United Kingdom was discussed. It was ascertained that supplies relating to new residential premises are zero-rated. Thirdly, the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services tax to residential properties in Canada was discussed. Canadian goods and services tax and harmonious sales tax legislation contains {{a broad range of}} special concessions relating to residential property developments. The harmonious sales tax which applies in some provinces, is a combination of goods and services tax and a provincial sales tax. Fourthly, the way goods and services tax is applied to residential property developments in Australia was determined. Australian legislation provides for a margin scheme to be applied to the development of residential properties. In terms of the margin scheme, goods and services tax is payable on the basis of profit rather than turnover. Transfer duty as applied in South Africa was examined {{as an alternative to the}} value-added tax being applied on residential properties developed by developers registered for value-added tax purposes. The legislation with regard to developers of residential properties registered for value-added tax, goods and services tax and harmonious sales tax purposes was measured against the principles of taxation. On the basis of these results, an alternative to the current application of value-added tax relating to developers registered for value-added tax purposes in South Africa was proposed that would be in line with that of the selected countries.

On this study good sanitary practices are applied to prevent outbreaks and minimize losses caused from IPN disease. To highlight importance of improvements on sanitary practices in IPN prevention were compared results from two studies, first conducted in year 2006 - 2009 with results from one year later study conducted in 2010. In year 2010, samples of organs are collected from 260 fish and pooled in 43 samples, taken in 18 trout farms. Samples are analyzed with RT-PCR method. In the second study the IPN virus was detected in 6 from 43 pools (14 %) showing higher infection rate comparing to first study (11. 5 %) and in 4 from 18 fish farms (22. 2 %) showing lower infection rate than in first study with 7 from 13 fish farms (53. 8 %).

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} good faith cannot be defined and {{furthermore}} {{that there is}} no need to define good faith as it takes on meaning when applied to facts. Hence an explanation or <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> faith is defined by its function namely to enforce the expected performance of both parties. It is further argued that the function <b>of</b> <b>good</b> faith will determine which fact pattern has to be found by a court in order to determine the expected performance of the contractual parties. It follows that good faith is the legal concept which allows courts to do justice and do it according to law. As good faith takes on meaning only when applied to contractual terms, Peden is correct to argue that “... the widespread use of ‘good faith’ in legislation is... completely unhelpful in the development <b>of</b> contractual <b>good</b> faith. ” An interesting way to juxtaposition this point transnationally is to look at international and US theories <b>of</b> <b>good</b> faith in the light of the development <b>of</b> <b>good</b> faith in a jurisdiction which has struck a civil law/common law compromise about the use of the concept. Australia presents itself as a fledgling nation in the development <b>of</b> <b>good</b> faith, while simultaneously being a CISG state subject to the <b>good</b> faith <b>of</b> Art. 7. The paper will therefore examine the following: The theoretical base on which a definition or explanation of the function <b>of</b> <b>good</b> faith is based is very divergent and will be discussed in part one. The conclusion which can be drawn from part one will be applied in part two to the most important available judicial decisions in determining whether there is consistency in the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> the concept.
