2500|$|A torque {{multiplier}} is <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> with reduction ratios {{greater than}} 1. [...] The given torque at the input gets multiplied as per the reduction ratio and {{transmitted to the}} output, thereby achieving greater torque, but with reduced rotational speed.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} half of 2010, the testing {{activity}} focused on tool wear management and machining a part in multiple setups with multiple alternate machining plans for 3, 4 and 5-axis machining. [...] The new test part was <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> that must be machined on all six sides. The tool wear and consequent machine loads were predicted from the STEP-NC data and verified using a dynamometer. [...] In the second half of 2010, the testing forum applied STEP-NC to set up compensation with on-machine measurement of part and fixture datums using a FaroArm portable measurement device.|$|E
2500|$|The blades rotate at 10 to 22 {{revolutions}} {{per minute}}. At 22 rotations per minute the tip speed exceeds [...] Higher tip speeds means more noise and blade erosion. <b>A</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> {{is commonly used}} for stepping up {{the speed of the}} generator, although designs may also use direct drive of an annular generator. Some models operate at constant speed, but more energy can be collected by variable-speed turbines which use a solid-state power converter to interface to the transmission system. All turbines are equipped with protective features to avoid damage at high wind speeds, by feathering the blades into the wind which ceases their rotation, supplemented by brakes.|$|E

50|$|The engine’s {{additional}} weight prompted the fitting of larger brake drums and wheels {{than on the}} 326. The 335 sustained BMW’s reputation for innovation, being the first car to offer <b>a</b> four-speed <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> with full synchromesh on all ratios.|$|R
5000|$|A free-turbine {{turboshaft}} {{is a form}} of turboshaft or turboprop {{gas turbine}} engine where the power is extracted from the exhaust stream of a gas turbine by a separate turbine, downstream of the gas turbine and is not connected to the gas turbine (the exhaust airflow is what spins the turbine that is connected to the shaft hence the term [...] "free"). This is opposed to the power being extracted from the power spool via <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{vehicle is}} driven by {{traction}} units. Each unit consists of traction container on the vehicle roof and of four traction motors, which drive wheels of one driving bogie. Individual wheel drive on respective bogies secures perfect use of adhesive conditions and ideal ride both in bends and on straight lines. There are three-phase synchronous motors with permanent magnet excitation on rotor. They are fixed to the bogie framework from the wheels outside. The traction motors don't use <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> - they drive tram wheels directly through a mechanically disconnectable jaw clutch.|$|E

50|$|The early Military Miniature Series {{differed}} from the western standard scales {{of the time and}} used 1/35 scale. The models included the option for the inclusion of batteries and <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> for motorization. These models were easy to assemble, the completed models looked good, and the parts were accurate. These qualities had given the series a good reputation ever since it was released. However, the option for motorization meant that the models needed to be inaccurate in some respects in order to work as motorized kits. More scale-accurate products which did not allow for motorization were renewed after the Tiger I's later model.|$|E
50|$|The {{funicular}} railway operates by 'hauling' up one carriage using electric motors {{to pull the}} haul rope as the other carriage descends at the same time. The system is powered by two stationary in series 500 kW electric motors, <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> <b>box</b> and a 'soft start-soft stop' control system which can increase the electrical frequency and vary the current and voltage to control the carriage speeds as they approach or leave a station. A hydraulically operated 'counter' rope is connected to both carriages to maintain haul rope tension. The two carriages are permanently connected by the haul rope and the counter rope and can never operate independently.|$|E
50|$|The {{tubular frame}} {{was made of}} 2 sections; the front end was made of pressed steel {{connected}} to the steering and front forks. It came with <b>a</b> tool <b>box,</b> <b>gear</b> indicator, foot pedal <b>gears</b> and <b>an</b> oil measuring jug integrated into the petrol tank cap.
