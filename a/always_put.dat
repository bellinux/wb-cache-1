On 27 January 1979, a presidential cabinet meeting decided that Confucianism is not a religion.

Following his death, many Icelandic football players and managers paid tribute to him. Leiknir midfielder Óttar Bjarni Guðmundsson described him as a great coach and a magnificent person who would always help his players. Sigursteinn's manager during his second spell with KR, Willum Þór Þórsson, paid tribute to his positive attitude as a player and praised his leadership abilities, while his former ÍA and Iceland team-mate Ólafur Adolfsson described him as a popular man who <b>always</b> <b>put</b> the interests of the team above his own.|$|E
25|$|On 22 May 2012, Ryan Richards {{announced}} that he was leaving the band. He cited his family as the reason, saying: “I’ve <b>always</b> <b>put</b> music first in my life – but the time has come now for my family to take the top spot”. It was the band's initial intention that Richards would not be replaced instantly and that the band would only look for a touring member to play for the band. However, it was announced on that Pat Lundy would be joining the band as Richards' replacement. Lundy is the former drummer of London-based heavy metal band Rise to Remain, having left the band in January 2012. After being contacted by the band to come to audition in Cardiff for the role, Pat learned their whole setlist in 7 days for the audition. Whilst the line up change occurred the band was recording and mixing their follow up to their fifth studio album. Across the year the band made few live appearances as they were working on the album, performing at Wakestock in North Wales, both the northern and southern dates of Slam Dunk Festival 2012 and the UK Warped Tour festival at the Alexandra Palace in London on 10 November 2012.|$|E

In response, at the debate the following day, Huntsman responded: [...] "I was criticized last night by Governor Romney for putting my country first, I just want to remind the people here in New Hampshire and throughout the United States that he criticized me while he was out raising money for serving my country in China, yes under a Democrat, like my two sons {{who are in the}} United States Navy.

[...] "I quite liked swimming, actually, and I'd occasionally dive, but once I saw Jaws there was no way I was ever going to learn to surf – no way!

500|$|Even though Clark {{could make}} the wrong choices, season five's [...] "Aqua" [...] helped {{illustrate}} the concept that Clark was [...] "... good to the core". The episode showed how protective he could be over someone, even when that person annoyed him. In this case, {{he was trying to}} warn Lois that Arthur Curry {{may not have been the}} man she believed him to be. This concept was echoed by the Seattle Times Julia Waterhous, who noted that Clark, despite all his flaws, <b>always</b> <b>put</b> others before himself. Welling's fellow actors also had their own insights into the character. Kristin Kreuk saw Clark as a kindred spirit who was sad, lonely, but also endearing; whereas John Schneider classified Clark as a special needs child.|$|E

He knows, and it makes him feel so bad." [...] She continued, [...] "We <b>always</b> <b>put</b> it out there that guys cheat, and finally someone put it in perspective: girls cheat too."

500|$|Rivera had an {{impeccable}} {{ability to}} accurately locate pitches and consistently throw strikes, {{particularly on the}} inside and outside edges of the strike zone. This strength offset his reliance on one pitch and hitters' anticipation of it. His former catcher Joe Girardi said, [...] "He was so easy to catch because he <b>always</b> <b>put</b> the ball right there. I don't think there's ever been a pitcher that great who was so easy to catch." [...] Rivera's 4.10 career strikeout-to-walk ratio in the regular season ranks ninth-best in major league history. His control was a byproduct of his smooth, easily repeated pitching motion, which some opposing hitters found to be deceptive. One such player, Darrin Fletcher, said in 1999 that Rivera [...] "almost kind of lulls you to sleep with his delivery. It gives you a false sense of security, and then the ball is on you and it's exploding." ...|$|E
500|$|The Houston Astros officially retired Bagwell's jersey number 5 on August 26, 2007, {{prior to}} the start of a game versus the Pittsburgh Pirates. [...] He was the eighth player in Astros history to have his number retired. [...] Two of Bagwell's closest friends and former teammates, Biggio and Brad Ausmus, spoke on his behalf. [...] Said Ausmus, [...] "He was the quintessential teammate. [...] He was a superstar who <b>always</b> <b>put</b> the team before himself. [...] And between he and Bidge (Biggio), they always {{shouldered}} the blame we struggled and tried to deflect the credit when we won." [...] Yastrzemski, Bagwell's childhood hero, delivered a special message: [...] "Congratulations, Jeff, on your number being retired. [...] I begged the Red Sox not to trade you when you were in the minors with us. [...] Boston's loss was Houston's gain. [...] See you in Cooperstown." [...] Three first bases were used in the game, each embossed with a commemorative insignia and inscription, [...] "No. 5, Jeff Bagwell jersey retirement, Aug. 26, 2007." [...] One was given to Bagwell and the other two were auctioned to raise funds on behalf of the Astros in Action Foundation.|$|E
500|$|After 1968 the Maharishi {{fell out}} of the public {{spotlight}} for a period and TM was described as a passing fad. Mike Love arranged for the Beach Boys to tour with the Maharishi in the US during the summer of 1968. However, the tour was cancelled after several appearances and was called [...] "one of the more bizarre entertainments of the era". Interest grew again in the mid-1970s when scientific studies began showing concrete results. The Maharishi moved to Europe {{in the early years of}} that decade and appeared twice on American television's The Merv Griffin Show in the mid 1970s, leading to a surge of popularity called the [...] "Merv wave". That was followed by the introduction of [...] "Yogic Flying", a technique which offered the promise of levitation. In a 1975 interview, Harrison said of the Beatles' association with Transcendental Meditation: [...] "In retrospect, that was probably one of the greatest experiences I've ever had … Maharishi was <b>always</b> <b>put</b> down for propagating what was basically a spiritual thing but there's so much being propagated that's damaging to life that I’m glad there are good people around like him."

500|$|The c.1800 {{manuscript}} {{stated that}} both the honour and {{the very existence of}} Clan MacLeod was thought to have depended upon the preservation of the Fairy Flag. Only the [...] "highest and purest blood of the race" [...] and the most renowned heroes, were selected to guard the flag when it was displayed. These twelve men, with a sword in hand, would stand just behind the chief who was <b>always</b> <b>put</b> in front. One family produced the hereditary keepers of the flag; and of this family, only the eldest living male could unfurl the flag. This family was called [...] "Clan Tormad Vic Vurichie" [...] ("the children of Tormod, son of Murchadh"), and was descended from Sìol Torcaill. The 20th century Hebridean author Alasdair Alpin MacGregor, when writing of the traditions of the flag, stated that the flag's bearers held lands on Skye near Bracadale for their services to the chiefs of Clan MacLeod. The first of the flag bearers from this family was buried within the same grave as the chief of the clan, on the island of Iona. The second, and last bearer, was buried at St Clements Church, in Rodel, on the island of Harris. This man's remains were covered by a magnificent monument; the stone coffin in which his body was placed, was six feet deep. A moveable iron grate rested about two feet from the lid, and the man's body rested upon the grate. The man's male descendants were also deposited within this coffin. This meant that when a newly deceased was placed within, the bones and dust of the previous occupant were sifted through the grate into the coffin below. The writer of the manuscript stated that in the time of his own father, the last male of this family was interred this way. The tomb was then sealed by this man's daughter. The c.1800 manuscript also noted that this family, prior to its extinction, became miserably poor.|$|E
