The Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund alone received $21 billion during FY2003 and FY2004.

500|$|American Idiot was {{inspired}} by contemporary American political events, like the presidency of George W. Bush <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq.</b> There are only two explicitly political songs on the album ("American Idiot" [...] and [...] "Holiday"), but the album [...] "draws a casual connection between contemporary American social dysfunction [...] and the Bush ascendancy." [...] While the content is clearly of the times, Armstrong hoped it would remain timeless and become more an overarching statement on confusion.|$|E
500|$|On December 3, 2006, Bayh {{announced}} that he would form an exploratory committee in order for him to travel and raise funds more effectively for a presidential run. Upon this declaration, the candidate appeared on This Week, articulating that Americans [...] "need someone who can deal with the dysfunction here in this city (Washington D.C.) so that our government begins to empower our people to fulfill their potential...if I can be that individual, so be it." [...] His spokesman remarked that the committee would help [...] "to put an infrastructure in place" [...] for the campaign. Bayh immediately returned to the campaign trail following his announcement, traveling back to Iowa on December 4 with approximately $10.6 million to continue spreading his message. The next weekend, Bayh visited New Hampshire to discuss his views on energy independence, global warming <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq.</b> But due to the two sold out appearances to the state by Barack Obama, who was recently named a potential candidate, Bayh's trip did not garner much media attention.|$|E

2500|$|After the 2008 {{nomination}} of Sarah Palin for Vice President of the United States, senior pastor Ed Kalnins' preaching was scrutinized by the media.

USA Today reported the Huffington Post assertion that [...] "Kalnins has preached that critics of President Bush will be banished to hell; questioned whether {{people who voted for}} Sen.

[...] The preview was released ahead of its September 21 launch on iTunes, as part of a web-campaign that included updates, promotion and links on forums, E-Magazines and several social networking sites. The song's lyrics cover a broad range of issues that are familiar to listeners of both artists – racism, world revolution, war, socialism, government control, rape, famine, colonialism, Classism, self-determination <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Twenty years later, Gordon, {{who had not}} {{previously}} considered {{himself to be a}} political artist, created Dancing Henry Five in response to the 9/11 attacks <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq.</b> [...] It also received mostly positive critical response. [...] It was called [...] "a bare-bones production that created a powerful epic mood" [...] by John Rockwell, who compared it favorably to a production at Lincoln Center. Other critics praised its [...] "humor and deft movement", its [...] "masterful blend of charm and sting", and called it [...] "stunning and provocative", while describing the movement in the dance-theater piece as [...] "stripped down and democratic". [...] "It takes a witty craftsman of dance theater like Gordon to turn a heroically jingoistic play into a wry but fervent plea for peace", wrote one critic about the most recent revival of the piece, while another wrote that [...] "The means are simple, the dancing far from virtuoso; the thought and meanings are complex." ...|$|E
