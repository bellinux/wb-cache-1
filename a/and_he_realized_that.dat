5|$|Hubert Humphrey got {{his start}} in Minnesota {{politics}} in the early 1940s. He was an organizer of the Minnesota Democratic Party at the time, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> the party's best chance of success would come if the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party merged with the Democratic party. Other party leaders had been discussing the merger, but Humphrey's idea {{was to keep the}} Farmer-Labor name {{in the name of the}} merged party, in order to gain the strength of thousands of loyal voters. Thus, the party got the name Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.|$|E
5|$|Pam asks Jim {{to talk to}} {{her father}} and {{convince}} him to work things out with her mother. But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns to the office and tells Jim her father left because Jim told him how much he loves Pam, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> he had never felt that way about her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates. Andy overhears her comments about her real life scenario, still thinks she is talking about the film they watched and concludes that he cannot be a movie critic because he is not as insightful as Jim and Pam.|$|E
25|$|Rummell {{attended}} The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, then {{completed his}} undergraduate education in 1967 with an Artium Baccalaureus (AB) degree in English literature with a Chemistry double major from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His first job involved selling laboratory equipment to hospitals, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> {{he was not}} a salesman. Friends attending the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania encouraged him to join them, so he enrolled there and received an MBA in 1971. Another friend from Wharton invited him to visit Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, where he met developer Charles Fraser, who offered Rummell a job.|$|E

25|$|After {{the failure}} of the Feltre meeting and the first bombing of Rome, the crisis accelerated. The day after Feltre, 20 July, Mussolini met Ambrosio twice. During the second meeting, in the evening, the Duce told him that he had decided to write to Hitler, confessing the need for Italy to abandon the alliance. Still angry about the missed {{opportunity}} to do this in Feltre, the indignant Ambrosio offered his resignation to the Duce, who rejected it. For Ambrosio, after Feltre Mussolini was useless, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> any hope that he could pull the chestnuts out of the fire was an illusion. Therefore, he decided to set the putsch in motion.|$|E
500|$|... "He trained us for films at {{the same}} time that he was {{training}} himself," [...] recalled Agnes Moorehead. [...] "Orson believed in good acting, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> rehearsals were needed to get the most from his actors. That was something new in Hollywood: nobody seemed interested in bringing in a group to rehearse before scenes were shot. But Orson knew it was necessary, and we rehearsed every sequence before it was shot." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Telepathy" [...] {{garnered}} {{a positive}} response from music critics. Writing for Idolator, Mike Wass was initially underwhelmed by [...] "Telepathy" [...] upon its release. According to him, he downloaded the song regardless, and added it {{to what he calls}} his [...] "Upbeat Xtina" [...] playlist. He writes that a few months later, the song played on shuffle <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> he had previously brushed off what he now believed {{to be one of the}} best and most underrated songs of 2016. Robbie Daw of the same publication was complimentary of Aguilera's vocal performance, opining that she [...] "sings beautifully amidst a swirling wall of sound." [...] He continued to write that it was a welcome change of tempo following the release of her previous single, [...] "Change". Samuel Suri of the Daily Mail similarly praised the singer's vocals, writing that she [...] "bringing her breathtaking blend of growling and belting to a disco anthem." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Spanish Governor of St Augustine Pedro Menéndez de Márquez (nephew of Pedro Menéndez de Avilés) {{was warned}} that Drake {{was off the}} coast, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> with fewer than a hundred militiamen he could offer {{little in the way}} of resistance. The Spanish {{settlers}} withdrew inland and hoped to make surprise raids against the English gradually. Drake and his men occupied the area of the small fort but during the night Indians attacked, launched by native allies of the Spanish garrison. Drake and his men held their ground and within twenty minutes the Indians were repulsed with some loss ...|$|E
2500|$|Both Labor and Liberal {{politicians}} {{who visited the}} United States were highly impressed with the rapidly growing importance of political broadcasts. [...] The 1931 national election {{was the first to}} feature heavy use of political broadcasts. Labor Prime Minister James Scullin was in a difficult contest, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> radio receivers were now widespread, and the medium was much more effective and much cheaper than stumping in person using long-distance train travel. The New South Wales Labor Party leader Jack Lang emulated President Roosevelt's [...] "fireside chat" [...] format. [...] Liberals followed suit; Robert Menzies based his 1949 Liberal campaign around radio broadcasts.|$|E
2500|$|Jones had {{originally}} planned {{to return to}} England {{as soon as the}} Pilgrims found a settlement site. But his crew members began to be ravaged by the same diseases that were felling the Pilgrims, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> he had to remain in Plymouth Harbor [...] "till he saw his men began to recover." [...] The Mayflower lay in New Plymouth harbor through the winter of 1620–21, then set sail for England on April 5, 1621, her empty hold ballasted with stones from the Plymouth Harbor shore. As with the Pilgrims, her sailors had been decimated by disease. Jones had lost his boatswain, his gunner, three quartermasters, the cook, {{and more than a dozen}} sailors.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Flint's {{feelings}} were, in a sense, akin {{to those}} of a traveller by sea who wakens out of a sound sleep in his cabin, with peculiar and unpleasant sensations, which he gradually discovers are due to cold water, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>realizes</b> <b>that</b> the boat on which he is travelling is sinking.|$|R
2500|$|John Augustus Tulk, who had {{exercised}} {{his right}} to buy half the gardens, was keen {{to build on the}} land and proposed creating a covered market to encompass the square and the buildings he owned around it, but the judgement the Tulks had earlier won against Moxhay proved troublesome because it stipulated that the space must be kept as either a garden or a pleasure garden. Popular feeling was that the gardens should be preserved as an open space, and the bill put before Parliament for the establishment of [...] "Regent Market" [...] was rejected. Tulk attempted to sell his interest in the gardens to a speculator, J. L. Tabberner, but the long negotiations fell through when Tabberner's plans for the garden were rejected <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> {{the other half of the}} gardens were still owned by Wyld.|$|E
2500|$|Anderson {{started to}} get ideas for Magnolia during the long editing period of Boogie Nights (1997). [...] As he got closer to {{finishing}} the film, he started writing down material for his new project. After the critical and financial success of Boogie Nights, New Line Cinema, who backed that film, told Anderson {{that he could do}} whatever he wanted and the filmmaker realized that, [...] "I was in a position I will never ever be in again". Michael De Luca, then Head of Production at New Line, made the deal for Magnolia, granting Anderson final cut without hearing an idea for the film. Originally, Anderson had wanted to make a film that was [...] "intimate and small-scale", something that he could shoot in 30 days. He had the title of [...] "Magnolia" [...] in his head before he wrote the script. As he started writing, the script [...] "kept blossoming" [...] <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> there were many actors he wanted to write for and then decided to put [...] "an epic spin on topics that don't necessarily get the epic treatment". He wanted to [...] "make the epic, the all-time great San Fernando Valley movie". Anderson started with lists of images, words and ideas that [...] "start resolving themselves into sequences and shots and dialogue", actors, and music. The first image he had for the film was the smiling face of actress Melora Walters. The next image that came to him was of Philip Baker Hall as her father. Anderson imagined Hall walking up the steps of Walters' apartment and having an intense confrontation with her. Anderson also did research on the magnolia tree and discovered a concept that eating the tree's bark helped cure cancer.|$|E
