All network entities, i. e., nodes and networks, behave in a self-organizing manner, where the global behavior emerges through their operation on local information and direct and/or indirect mutual interaction intra- and inter-layers. We show several results to demonstrate how self-organizing network control behaves based on our architecture.

Granulomas can be located in many tissues, most prominently the lungs and associated lymph nodes, and are made up of multiple immune cells that can actively containM. tuberculosis. Granuloma-based research involving both animal models and clinical studies is needed to confirm these hypotheses, which will further our understanding of this coinfection and may lead to better treatment options.
