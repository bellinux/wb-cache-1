5|$|Although {{geographical}} {{names have been}} formally changed in Turkey, their native names persist and continue in local dialects throughout the country. At times, Turkish politicians have also used the native names of cities during their speeches. In 2009, when <b>addressing</b> <b>a</b> crowd {{in the town of}} Güroymak, president Abdullah Gül used the native name Norşin. Also that year, when talking about his family origins, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan used the native Greek name of Potamya instead of Güneysu.|$|E
5|$|Attalus was a {{protector}} of the Greek cities of Anatolia and viewed himself as the champion of Greeks against barbarians. During his reign he established Pergamon as a considerable power in the Greek East. He died in 197BC, shortly {{before the end of}} the second war, at the age of 72, having suffered an apparent stroke while <b>addressing</b> <b>a</b> Boeotian war council some months before. He and his wife were admired for their rearing of their four sons. He was succeeded as king by his son Eumenes II.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Russian {{declaration}} of war {{came as a surprise}} to both Carol and Kogălniceanu, who had not been informed of the exact date (April 23) when the Imperial Russian Army would start moving into Moldavia—hence, Romanians tended to regard it as an invasion. Also alarming for Kogălniceanu, the official Russian proclamation addressed Romanians as protegés of the Empire. Bilateral tensions were somewhat alleviated by Russian apologies and, later, by the Ottoman pledge to annex Romania; <b>addressing</b> <b>a</b> discontented Parliament, Kogălniceanu asserted that the Russian road was the country's only choice.|$|E
50|$|The first foreign {{dignitary}} to <b>address</b> <b>a</b> {{joint session}} of Congress was Ambassador Andre’ de Laboulaye of France who <b>addressed</b> <b>a</b> joint session on May 20, 1934 to memorialize the centennial anniversary {{of the death of}} Marquis de Lafayette. The first non-dignitary to <b>address</b> <b>a</b> joint meeting of Congress was Polish Solidarity leader Lech Wałęsa in 1989.

5|$|Select {{committees}} are temporary committees, {{established by the}} Senate to deal with particular issues. This may occur when a particular group of Senators wishes to examine an issue in depth, or {{where there is no}} existing committee suited to <b>addressing</b> <b>a</b> particular topic. Australian Senate select committees have included ones set up to examine the Administration of Indigenous Affairs, and Mental Health. Select committees usually cease to exist upon reporting back to the chamber. One exception to this was the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation which in various forms existed for a decade.|$|E
5|$|Even before Haywood {{first became}} an {{official}} with the Western Federation of Miners, {{he was convinced that}} the system under which working people toiled was unjust. He described the execution of the Haymarket leaders in 1887 as a turning point in his life, predisposing him toward membership in the largest organization of the day, the Knights of Labor. Haywood had watched men die in unsafe mine tunnels, and had marched with Kelly's Army. He had suffered a serious hand injury in the mines, and found that his only support came from other miners. When Haywood listened to Ed Boyce of the WFM <b>addressing</b> <b>a</b> group of miners in 1896, he discovered radical unionism and welcomed it.|$|E
5|$|Lara {{appealed the}} denial of his motion to dismiss to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that the Tribal Court {{obtained}} its authority from the ICRA, an act of Congress, and that both the Tribal Court and the Federal Court derived their power from the same sovereign. A three-judge panel of the Circuit Court affirmed {{the decision of the}} District Court, holding that the tribe derived its power from its own retained sovereignty that was separate from the sovereignty of the United States. The Eighth Circuit's panel noted that in the Duro decision, the Supreme Court had observed that Congress could address the jurisdictional system, which Congress did. When Congress amended the ICRA, they were <b>addressing</b> <b>a</b> federal common law issue, not a constitutional issue, and were within their authority to recognize the sovereignty of the tribes. The panel then affirmed the trial court on the Petite claim. Judge Hansen dissented, believing that the tribe drew its authority to try Lara from the federal government.|$|E

5|$|Much of Havelock's {{work was}} devoted to <b>addressing</b> <b>a</b> single thesis: that all of Western thought is {{informed}} by a profound shift {{in the kinds of}} ideas available to the human mind at the point that Greek philosophy converted from an oral to a literate form. The idea has been very controversial in classical studies, and has been rejected outright both by many of Havelock's contemporaries and modern classicists. Havelock and his ideas have nonetheless had far-reaching influence, both in classical studies and other academic areas. He and Walter J. Ong (who was himself strongly influenced by Havelock) essentially founded the field that studies transitions from orality to literacy, and Havelock {{has been one of the}} most frequently cited theorists in that field; as an account of communication, his work profoundly affected the media theories of Harold Innis and Marshall McLuhan. Havelock's influence has spread beyond the study of the classical world to that of analogous transitions in other times and places.|$|E
5|$|That same {{evening the}} Senate convened at the Temple of Concord and summarily {{condemned}} Sejanus to death. He was led from prison and strangled. His body was cast onto the Gemonian stairs, where the crowd tore it to pieces. Riots ensued, in which crowds hunted and killed anyone they could link to Sejanus. The Praetorians also resorted to looting, {{when they were}} accused of having conspired with the former prefect. Following the issue of damnatio memoriae by the Senate, his statues were torn down and his name obliterated from all public records. On October 24, Sejanus' eldest son Strabo was arrested and executed. Upon learning of his death, Apicata committed suicide (October 26), after <b>addressing</b> <b>a</b> letter to Tiberius, claiming that Drusus had been poisoned with the complicity of Livilla. The accusations were further corroborated by confessions from Livilla's slaves, who, under torture, admitted to having administered the poison to Drusus.|$|E
5|$|William Penn {{stayed in}} Wells shortly {{before leaving for}} America (1682), {{spending}} a night at The Crown Inn. Here he was briefly arrested for <b>addressing</b> <b>a</b> large crowd in the market place, but released on {{the intervention of the}} Bishop of Bath and Wells. During the Monmouth Rebellion (1685) the rebel army attacked the cathedral in an outburst against the established church and damaged the west front. Lead from the roof was used to make bullets, windows were broken, the organ smashed and horses stabled in the nave. Wells was the final location of the Bloody Assizes on 23 September 1685. In a makeshift court lasting only one day, over 500 men were tried and the majority sentenced to death.|$|E

5|$|As 1989 wore on, Prost {{continually}} {{claimed his}} Honda V10s were not producing {{the same amount}} of power as those in Senna's car. It actually {{got to the point where}} Honda F1 boss Osamu Goto felt compelled to speak to the specialist British media on the matter. He claimed that Senna's foot-tapping style with the accelerator helped keep the RA109-E's revs up in the engine's mid-range where most of the power was, while Prost's smoother style dropped the engines into low revs where they had a pick-up problem. Apparently the talk was convincing until most of those present noticed Goto continually called them Ayrton and Prost respectively (per Japanese customs, <b>addressing</b> <b>a</b> person by their first name rather than the surname shows a much higher degree of familiarity and confidentiality). An example of Prost's claims came during the Mexican Grand Prix. Despite his car running less wing than Senna's which theoretically would give him greater top speed, Prost's McLaren was not able to pass Senna's on the long front straight even though he came of the final Peraltada Curve clearly faster than the Brazilian and also had the benefit of a tow. In stark contrast, late in the race when Senna was lapping Prost (who was on fresh tyres), Senna was easily able to power past Prost on the straight.|$|E
