Tens of thousands of syllabi exist in paper format, and thousands more exist on CD in various electronic formats.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an on-chip all-digital sensor architecture to capture process variation information. The proposed solution {{is based on}} the concept of variation amplification and uses the propagation delay measurement in a chain composed of series connected pass-transistors. The proposed sensor circuit is able to capture the local variation of nMOS and pMOS transistor individually. A sensor block is proposed, which contains N-type and P-type sensor circuit along with scan, control, and measurement circuitry. An array of sensor blocks with scan chain connection gathers process variation information all across the die. Detailed SPICE level simulations conducted for an industrial 45 nm CMOS technology indicates its feasibility in sensing, and on-chip <b>all-digital</b> measurement of <b>process</b> variation effec...|$|R

The company produced colorized product for Fox Home Entertainment, Universal Pictures, Paramount, Sony, Japan’s Tsuburaya, BBC and several other major global media and distribution companies. After being introduced to digital 3D in 2007, Dr. Sandrew created a conversion process and pipeline that eventually became the gold standard of 3D conversion, an accomplishment that stands today. In 2010, following the release of Alice in Wonderland, he changed the name of Legend Films to Legend 3D, and colorization took on a low priority {{in order for the}} company to focus entirely on the stereoscopic conversion of feature films and commercials. In late 2014, the company expanded to create two additional lines of business: Legend VFX, providing visual effects, and Legend VR, offering a full complement of pre- and post-production services for the creation of top tier virtual reality experiences.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Determination {{of maximum}} {{operating}} frequencies (Fmax) during manufacturing test at different operating voltages is required to: (a) to ensure that, for a Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) system, the adaptation hardware actually applies the correct operating frequency corresponding to a scaled supply and (b) to sort chips in different voltage-frequency (V-Fmax) bins, so that chips at different bins {{can be used}} for different applications. Existing speed binning approach requires extensive delay testing at all operating points with all possible frequencies, which increases test cost and test time significantly. In this paper, we propose a low-overhead solution for characterizing Fmax of a circuit at different operating voltages that can eliminate the complex and expensive Fmax calibration at multiple voltage points. The basic idea is to choose a small set of representative paths in a circuit based on their voltage sensitivity and dynamically configuring them into ring oscillator to compute the Fmax. The proposed calibration mechanism is <b>all-digital,</b> robust to <b>process</b> variations, reasonably accurate (average 2. 8 % error) and incorporates minimal hardware overhead (average 1. 7 % delay, 3. 5 % area and 0. 28 % power overhead) ...|$|R
