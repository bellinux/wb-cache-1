30|$|Estimating {{effects of}} level 1 and 2 variables. In {{multilevel}} analysis, centring predictors {{is particularly important}} since parameter interpretation depends heavily on the centring method chosen: using the group mean (cwc) or the grand mean (cgm). In accordance {{with the work of}} Brincks (2012; see also Enders and Tofighi 2007), researchers should use cgm when the effects of a variable at <b>all</b> three <b>levels</b> are of interest. However, as mentioned above, {{it was not possible to}} model all predictors at <b>all</b> three <b>levels.</b> Thus, separate models were used for level 1 and level 2 variables, but they contained <b>all</b> predictors at <b>levels</b> 1 and 2 and aggregated mathematics and grade scores at level 3. However, in the first model, <b>all</b> <b>level</b> 1 variables were centred around the group mean, and their corresponding level 2 aggregate was included at level 2, as recommended by Ntoumanis (2014), in order to obtain pure estimates of effects of within-student variables. In the second model, in order to identify effects of level 2 predictors that are controlled for by level 1 and level 3 equivalents, centring was achieved as follows: To <b>all</b> <b>level</b> 2 predictors that had no equivalent at level 3, cwc was applied, and cgm was applied to the rest.|$|R
