2500|$|Both Harper and Dion {{addressed}} {{the nation on}} December 3, 2008, with televised statements broadcast on Canada's major television networks. Harper's five-minute pre-recorded statement, televised nationally in English and French at 7 pm Eastern Time (ET), outlined the steps the government had taken to address the economic crisis and attacked the Liberals for forming a coalition with the Bloc Québécois. Harper said: [...] "at a time of global economic instability, Canada's government must stand unequivocally for keeping the country together. At <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> a coalition with the separatists cannot help Canada. And the opposition {{does not have the}} democratic right to impose a coalition with the separatists they promised voters would never happen." [...] The press noted that while he used the word sovereigntist in the French version of his speech, Harper used separatist in English.|$|E

[...] She resisted – how could she leave her unit at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> <b>this?</b> [...] Spears was insistent but she was reluctant, as was Captain Gosset, who feared the road might be cut and that she would be unable to get back. [...] They heard that Dunkirk had been evacuated. [...] Then Spears rang again – this time ordering her to come to Paris. [...] She decided to make a dash to the capital and back. [...] They met at the British embassy. [...] With the French army collapsing on all fronts, Spears was exhausted. 'His eyes were bloodshot. [...] There were lines inches deep in his face. [...] I saw for one second what was going to happen. [...] The war leapt at me out of his eyes. [...] I was terrified.' ...|$|E

30|$|The {{epidemic}} models {{where the}} total population {{is assumed to be}} constant are classical models given for short-term epidemics. When the epidemic disease arises and vanishes in <b>a</b> short <b>time</b> <b>like</b> influenza, <b>this</b> kind of models give realistic results. But in the case of long-term effective diseases like hepatitis, rabies, rubella and so on, limiting the population to be constant would be a very strong assumption that affects the realism of the model. In this paper, we propose a new mathematical model in which we assume that the population is nonconstant. What is more, with a particular choice of the natural death rate function in the model, it gives a classical logistic growth for the population.|$|R

The right of access to information and ideas is vital for any society. We know, freedom, prosperity and the development of society depend on education as well as on unrestricted access to knowledge, thought culture and information. Democracy, a government of the people by the people and for the people is widely acclaimed as the most suitable model of governance in the world. According to Kofi Annan, the UN secretary General, as he stated once, “If information and knowledge are central to democracy, they are the conditions for development”. At <b>a</b> crucial <b>time</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> when libraries are facing decreasing resources and competition from other agencies and technologies, there is an urgent need for vocal public support for the service they provide. There is need, therefore, for an effective lobby to communicate the value of libraries and the profession to politicians, the media and others who can influence public opinion. Libraries have always been a cornerstone in building that society, which ensures those citizens, has access to information so that they can gain the knowledge to govern themselves. A commitment to intellectual freedom or right to information is a core responsibility for the library and information profession...|$|R

King is {{conducting}} rigorous canvass of business districts to determine {{number of employees}} who are sick and thereby determine status of epidemic in the city. *King still advocates strict quarantine, but decision will be taken at tomorrow’s Board of Health meeting. *King decried San Antonio citizens’ lack of regard for flu precautions, and their tendency to think that health officials ordered closures without considering financial burdens: “That {{has been one of}} our main troubles in San Antonio,” said Dr. King. “The people have treated lightly the warnings of the health department and the various learned physicians, and have been led by random reasonings of their own. In <b>a</b> critical <b>time</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> the health department does not lay down rules unless there is a practical and scientific basis for them.

This principle was found to be true during our last quarantine, when we closed such places as people were allowed to crowd into.

25|$|VAM Gremlins {{used the}} updated body {{design of the}} U.S. and Canadian market AMC Spirit two-door sedan, as well as VAM {{versions}} of the Spirit Liftback, called the American GT and the Rally AMX. At the time, cars in Mexico took longer {{to be perceived as}} outdated than in the US and since the VAM Gremlin came to the public until 1974 instead of 1970, it was still relatively fresh among the Mexican buyers. Aside from this, the model kept a positive image throughout its whole run. In fact, it exceeded VAM's sales expectations in its first years. The company originally considered it a temporary low-volume model that would eventually be replaced by the upcoming Pacer model. In the end, the Gremlin stood and became VAM's all-time second best-selling line after the American. For these reasons VAM decided to keep the Gremlin name for the upcoming Spirit sedan model, being a testament of the very favorable image VAM cars in general held in Mexico. This was the third <b>time</b> <b>a</b> case <b>like</b> <b>this</b> happened within the company with Rebel and Matador models kept the name Rambler Classic and the Hornet the Rambler American name.|$|R
