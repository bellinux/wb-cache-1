5|$|Although <b>atherosclerosis</b> {{occurs to}} a certain degree in all people, people with FH may develop {{accelerated}} <b>atherosclerosis</b> due to the excess level of LDL. The degree of <b>atherosclerosis</b> approximately depends on the number of LDL receptors still expressed and the functionality of these receptors. In many heterozygous forms of FH, the receptor function is only mildly impaired, and LDL levels will remain relatively low. In the more serious homozygous forms, the receptor is not expressed at all.|$|E
5|$|<b>Atherosclerosis</b> risk is {{increased}} further {{with age and}} in those who smoke, have diabetes, {{high blood pressure and}} a family history of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} {{is also known}} as ischemic heart disease, is caused by <b>atherosclerosis</b> – a {{build-up}} of plaque along the inner walls of the arteries which narrows them, reducing the blood flow to the heart. A stable plaque may cause chest pain (angina) or breathlessness during exercise or at rest, or no symptoms at all. A ruptured plaque can block a blood vessel and lead to ischaemia of the heart muscle, causing unstable angina or a heart attack. In the worst case this may cause cardiac arrest, a sudden and utter loss of output from the heart. Obesity, high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes, smoking and high cholesterol can all increase the risk of developing <b>atherosclerosis</b> and coronary artery disease.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its effects on thrombosis, hypercoagulable states may accelerate the development of <b>atherosclerosis,</b> the arterial disease that underlies myocardial infarction {{and other forms of}} cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|More {{controversial}} is {{the addition}} of ezetimibe, which inhibits cholesterol absorption in the gut. While it reduces LDL cholesterol, {{it does not appear}} to improve a marker of <b>atherosclerosis</b> called the intima-media thickness. Whether this means that ezetimibe is of no overall benefit in FH is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Accelerated {{deposition}} of cholesterol {{in the walls}} of arteries leads to <b>atherosclerosis,</b> the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. The most common problem in FH {{is the development of}} coronary artery disease (<b>atherosclerosis</b> of the coronary arteries that supply the heart) at a much younger age than would be expected in the general population. This may lead to angina pectoris (chest pain or tightness on exertion) or heart attacks. Less commonly, arteries of the brain are affected; this may lead to transient ischemic attacks (brief episodes of weakness {{on one side of the}} body or inability to talk) or occasionally stroke. Peripheral artery occlusive disease (obstruction of the arteries of the legs) occurs mainly in people with FH who smoke; this can cause pain in the calf muscles during walking that resolves with rest (intermittent claudication) and problems due to a decreased blood supply to the feet (such as gangrene).|$|E
5|$|Between 1980 and 2000, {{there have}} been four {{recorded}} deaths, all in Tasmania and all due to anaphylactic shock. All known patients who died from jack jumper stings were at least 40 {{years old and had}} cardiopulmonary comorbidities. Severe laryngeal oedema and coronary <b>atherosclerosis</b> was detected in most of the autopsies of those who died. Most of the victims died within 20 minutes after being stung. Prior to any desensitisation program being established, the fatality rate was one person every four years from the sting.|$|E
5|$|FH {{needs to}} be {{distinguished}} from familial combined hyperlipidemia and polygenic hypercholesterolemia. Lipid levels {{and the presence of}} xanthomata can confirm the diagnosis. Sitosterolemia and cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis are two rare conditions that can also present with premature <b>atherosclerosis</b> and xanthomas. The latter condition can also involve neurological or psychiatric manifestations, cataracts, diarrhea and skeletal abnormalities.|$|E
5|$|Some {{studies of}} FH cohorts suggest that {{additional}} risk factors are generally at play {{when a person}} develops <b>atherosclerosis.</b> In addition to the classic risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes, genetic {{studies have shown that}} a common abnormality in the prothrombin gene (G20210A) increases the risk of cardiovascular events in people with FH. Several studies found that a high level of lipoprotein(a) was an additional risk factor for ischemic heart disease. The risk was also found to be higher in people with a specific genotype of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).|$|E
5|$|There {{have also}} been reports in other genetic conditions, such as osteogenesis imperfecta type 1, {{autosomal}} dominant polycystic kidney disease and pseudoxanthoma elasticum, α1 antitrypsin deficiency and hereditary hemochromatosis, but evidence for these associations is weaker. Genetic studies in other connective tissue-related genes have mostly yielded negative results. Other abnormalities to the blood vessels, such as fibromuscular dysplasia, {{have been reported in}} a proportion of cases. <b>Atherosclerosis</b> does not appear to increase the risk.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{of heart}} disease {{includes}} primary and secondary prevention {{to prevent the occurrence}} or worsening of symptoms and <b>atherosclerosis.</b> This includes recommendations to cease smoking, decrease alcohol consumption, increase exercise, and make modifications to their diet to decrease the consumption of fats and sugars. Medications may also be given to help better control concurrent diabetes. Statins or other drugs such as fibrates may also be given to decrease a person's cholesterol levels. Blood pressure medication may also be commenced or modified.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} on bond, Jernigan {{returned}} to {{the room at the}} Continental Inn in Lexington where he had been living prior to his arrest. On July 18, 1984, Jernigan's son Randy found him dead in the room. An autopsy showed that Jernigan suffered from coronary <b>atherosclerosis,</b> and heart disease was officially listed as the cause of death. Lexington police determined that there was no evidence to suggest foul play. Jernigan's ex-wife continued to pursue Jernigan's case against Wilkinson, but a Fayette County Circuit Court Judge awarded Wilkinson a summary judgment to dismiss the case in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{stress is}} thought to {{contribute}} to the development of a wide range of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, the pathologies caused by diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and neurodegeneration in motor neuron diseases. In many of these cases, it is unclear if oxidants trigger the disease, or if they are produced as a secondary consequence of the disease and from general tissue damage; One case in which this link is particularly well understood is the role of oxidative stress in cardiovascular disease. Here, low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation appears to trigger the process of atherogenesis, which results in <b>atherosclerosis,</b> and finally cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Atherosclerosis</b> {{generally}} starts when {{a person}} is young and worsens with age. Almost all people are affected to some degree by the age of 65. <b>Atherosclerosis</b> is the number one cause of death and disability in the developed world. <b>Atherosclerosis</b> was first described in 1575. There is evidence, however, that the condition occurred in people more than 5,000 years ago.|$|E
25|$|There exist {{commonly}} used vaccines to some herpesviruses, but only veterinary, such as HVT/LT (Turkey herpesvirus vector laryngotracheitis vaccine). However, it prevents <b>atherosclerosis</b> (which histologically mirrors <b>atherosclerosis</b> in humans) in target animals vaccinated.|$|E
25|$|Epigenetic {{modifications}} such as DNA methylation {{have been}} implicated in cardiovascular disease, including <b>atherosclerosis.</b> In animal models of <b>atherosclerosis,</b> vascular tissue as well as blood cells such as mononuclear blood cells exhibit global hypomethylation with gene-specific areas of hypermethylation. DNA methylation polymorphisms {{may be used as}} an early biomarker of <b>atherosclerosis</b> since they are present before lesions are observed, which may provide an early tool for detection and risk prevention.|$|E
25|$|Carotid {{stenosis}} {{may occur}} {{in patients with}} <b>atherosclerosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|So far, no {{large-scale}} research {{involving the}} incidence of <b>atherosclerosis</b> and coronary heart disease in adults with cystic fibrosis has been conducted. This is likely because {{the vast majority of}} people with cystic fibrosis do not live long enough to develop clinically significant <b>atherosclerosis</b> or coronary heart disease.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{coronary}} syndrome often {{reflects a}} degree of damage to the coronaries by <b>atherosclerosis.</b> Primary prevention of <b>atherosclerosis</b> is controlling the risk factors: healthy eating, exercise, treatment for hypertension and diabetes, avoiding smoking and controlling cholesterol levels; in patients with significant risk factors, aspirin {{has been shown to}} reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. Secondary prevention is discussed in myocardial infarction.|$|E
25|$|Angiotensin II {{increases}} {{synthesis of}} plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, so it accelerates {{the development of}} <b>atherosclerosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} shown that both active and passive {{cigarette}} smoking increase the risk of <b>atherosclerosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Complications of {{hypertension}} are clinical outcomes {{that result from}} persistent elevation of blood pressure. Hypertension is {{a risk factor for}} all clinical manifestations of <b>atherosclerosis</b> since it is a risk factor for <b>atherosclerosis</b> itself. It is an independent predisposing factor for heart failure, coronary artery disease, stroke, renal disease, and peripheral arterial disease. It is the most important risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, in industrialized countries.|$|E
25|$|Immunomodulation of <b>atherosclerosis</b> is {{the term}} for {{techniques}} that modulate immune system function to suppress this macrophage action.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 1970s, {{building}} on the pioneering work of Charles Dotter in 1964 and especially Andreas Gruentzig starting in 1977, coronary catheterization has been extended to therapeutic uses: (a) the performance of less invasive physical treatment for angina {{and some of the}} complications of severe <b>atherosclerosis,</b> (b) treating heart attacks before complete damage has occurred and (c) research for better understanding of the pathology of coronary artery disease and <b>atherosclerosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Late graft stenosis, {{particularly}} of saphenous vein grafts due to <b>atherosclerosis</b> causing recurrent angina or myocardial infarction.|$|E
25|$|Hearts {{can become}} less {{efficient}} {{in old age}} with a resulting loss of stamina. In addition, <b>atherosclerosis</b> can constrict blood flow.|$|E
25|$|People with RA {{are more}} prone to <b>atherosclerosis,</b> and risk of {{myocardial}} infarction (heart attack) and stroke is markedly increased.|$|E
25|$|The {{immunomodulation}} approaches mentioned above, {{because they}} deal with innate responses of the host to promote <b>atherosclerosis,</b> have far greater prospects for success.|$|E
25|$|The Marseilles {{physician}} Dr. Jean Vague, in 1947, {{observed that}} upper body obesity appeared to predispose to diabetes, <b>atherosclerosis,</b> gout and calculi.|$|E
25|$|Interventional and non-interventional {{methods to}} detect <b>atherosclerosis,</b> {{specifically}} vulnerable plaque (non-occlusive or soft plaque), {{are widely used}} in research and clinical practice today.|$|E
25|$|The intima-media {{thickness}} of the carotid artery wall is a marker of subclinical <b>atherosclerosis,</b> it increases with age and with long-term exposure to particulate air pollution.|$|E
25|$|An {{atheroma}} is {{an accumulation}} of degenerative material in the inner layer of an artery wall. The material consists of mostly macrophage cells, or debris, containing lipids, calcium and a variable amount of fibrous connective tissue. The accumulated material forms a swelling in the artery wall, which may intrude into the channel of the artery, narrowing it and restricting blood flow. Atheroma occurs in <b>atherosclerosis,</b> {{which is one of}} the three subtypes of arteriosclerosis (which are <b>atherosclerosis,</b> Monckeberg's arteriosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis).|$|E
25|$|Another {{gene that}} {{experiences}} {{a change in}} methylation status in <b>atherosclerosis</b> is the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT3), which produces a protein responsible for the transport of lactate and other ketone bodies out of many cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells. In <b>atherosclerosis</b> patients, there {{is an increase in}} methylation of the CpG islands in exon 2, which decreases MCT3 protein expression. The down regulation of MCT3 impairs lactate transport, and significantly increases smooth muscle cell proliferation, which further contributes to the atherosclerotic lesion. An ex vivo experiment using the demethylating agent Decitabine (5-aza-2 -deoxycytidine) was shown to induce MCT3 expression in a dose dependant manner, as all hypermethylated sites in the exon 2 CpG island became demethylated after treatment. This may serve as a novel therapeutic agent to treat <b>atherosclerosis,</b> although no human studies have been conducted thus far.|$|E
25|$|Anti-miR-712 {{effectively}} suppresses d-flow-induced miR-712 {{expression and}} increases TIMP3 expression. Anti-miR-712 also inhibits vascular hyperpermeability, thereby significantly reducing <b>atherosclerosis</b> lesion development and immune cell infiltration.|$|E
25|$|BALB/c {{are noted}} for {{displaying}} {{high levels of}} anxiety and for being relatively resistant to diet-induced <b>atherosclerosis,</b> making them a useful model for cardiovascular research.|$|E
25|$|Methionine is an {{intermediate}} in the biosynthesis of cysteine, carnitine, taurine, lecithin, phosphatidylcholine, and other phospholipids. Improper conversion of methionine {{can lead to}} <b>atherosclerosis.</b>|$|E
