With the enormous diversity in practice setting, pay-ment approach, and patient populations in the United States, it is particularly challenging to identify the factors and strategies that are associated with successful implemen-tation. It is also difficult to determine the role of context in studies of implementation, since few publications provide enough information about the organizational context in which implementation takes place for readers to know whether lessons might apply in their organizations [1, 2]. Depression care improvement provides an excellent opportunity to learn about implementation.

The concept, watershed governance, can promote connections among forest, land, wetland, surface and ground waters, and vegetation based on the spatial and temporal scales of basin management. Current basin ecological vulnerabilities like flooding, drought, salinity, and river bank erosion can be described <b>as</b> <b>major</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>for</b> restoring previous ecological systems. Recognition of the basin ecological integrity is one major mechanism to overcome these vulnerabilities. The short term benefits of this flow can secure water and ecological services for agricultural production, food security, irrigation, and flood control. The long term benefits include habitat and biodiversity protection, which can reduce ecological vulnerabilities. These {{short and long term}} objectives in the basin water management can promote sustainable ecosystems (Baron et al. 2002).|$|E
40|$|Tertiarisation“, work {{organisation}} and working-time regulation There {{is a widely}} held view that existing forms of labour market and, in particular, working time regulation in various continental European countries are {{no longer able to}} meet the economic needs of the future, since the “tertiarisation ” requires flexibility and diversity in terms of products, employment and working-time forms. In the present paper, the “market orientation ” of work in both services and manufacturing, rather than “tertiarisation”, is favoured as an alternative paradigm which creates room for the advent of “passive “ as well as “active “ approaches to temporal flexibility.

30|$|For collaboration, {{information}} sharing is crucial. Bharosa et al. [29] discuss challenges and obstacles in sharing and coordinating information during multi-agency disaster response. They consider challenges from an inter- and intra-organisational {{as well as}} an individual perspective. As major challenges they identify conflicting role structures, mismatch between goals and independent projects, focus on vertical {{information sharing}}, information overload, inability to determine what should be shared or the prioritization of own problems. Bharosa et al. [29] further identify factors to influence information sharing and coordination such as improving interaction and familiarity of other roles, knowledge of other agencies’ operations or the information and system quality. Furthermore, challenges with regard to information flow during crisis management occur [5]. Based on case studies, Militello et al. [5] identify asymmetric knowledge and experience, barriers to maintaining mutual awareness, and uneven workload distribution and disrupted communication <b>as</b> <b>major</b> <b>challenges.</b> <b>For</b> each of the challenges, different recommendations are presented. To overcome asymmetric knowledge, they suggest to provide tools for communication and train their usage. To improve mutual awareness, they propose the use of shared displays. To address the uneven workload, they suggest to more clearly assign roles and make their responsibilities known across organisations. The latter is also stressed in [30].|$|E
40|$|Among {{the various}} {{extensions}} {{to the common}} [0, 1]-valued truth degrees of "traditional" fuzzy set theory, closed intervals of [0, 1] stand out as a particularly appealing and promising choice for representing imperfect information, nicely accommodating and combining the facets of vagueness and uncertainty without paying too much in terms of computational complexity. From a logical point of view, due {{to the failure of}} the omnipresent prelinearity condition, the underlying algebraic structure L^I falls outside the mainstream of the research on formal fuzzy logics (including MV-, BL- and MTL-algebras), and consequently so far has received only marginal attention. This comparative lack of interest for interval-valued fuzzy logic has been further strengthened, perhaps, by taking for granted that its algebraic operations amount to a twofold application of corresponding operations on the unit interval. Abandoning that simplifying assumption, however, we may ﬁnd that L^I reveals itself as a very rich and noteworthy structure allowing the construction of complex and surprisingly well-behaved logical systems. Reviewing the main advances on the algebraic characterization of logical operations on L^I, and relating these results to the familiar completeness questions (which remain <b>as</b> <b>major</b> <b>challenges)</b> <b>for</b> the associated formal fuzzy logics, this paper paves the way for a systematic study of interval-valued fuzzy logic in the narrow sense...|$|E
40|$|The {{debate on}} Security Sector Reform (SSR) in Palestine has emerged {{within the context}} of the peace process between Israel and Palestinians, in {{particular}} following the Oslo agreement in 1993. There are different perceptions of the significance and relevance of SSR in the Palestinian context, and these depend on ideological, political allegiances and interests of domestic, regional and international actors talking about SSR. Some blame the Israeli occupation and military activities and also the governance of the Palestinian security sector for the deterioration of internal security. Others consider that the SSR is an integral element of the process of state-building to allow the Palestinians to establish an effective authority over their territories. However, Israel and external actors like the United States and the European Union still look at Palestinian SSR as a means to confront “terror and violence” and to prevent the emergence of any dangers to Israel. Israeli occupation and internal political divisions described and analyzed in this article <b>as</b> <b>major</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>for</b> Palestinian SSR. In addition, this article argues that this reform is not an end in itself, but is a necessary and a fundamental element to achieve the Palestinian national project in terms of liberation and state-building...|$|E

Since the {{introduction}} of calcineurin inhibitors, {{there has been a}} significant improvement in the results of solid organ transplantation, including graft and patient survival. However, high cost, chronic nephrotoxicity and other side effects stand <b>as</b> <b>major</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>for</b> long-term use of these drugs. The long-term safety and financial benefits of the combination ketoconazole–cyclosporine previously studied. However, data about the effect of the addition of ketoconazole addition to tacrolimus-treated patients are scarce. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the safety and financial impact of that combination. Methods. The subjects of this work included 70 livedonor stable kidney transplant recipients receiving tacrolimus. Their age ranged from 16 to 45 years. Among them, 54 were males and 16 were females. All of them were 6 months or more post-transplantation. Patients were randomly divided into two equal groups. Group I patients initially received ketoconazole 100 mg/day in addition to their usual treatment, while group II patients were considered a control. Patients were followed-up for 6 months. Results. Concomitant ketoconazole–tacrolimus resulted in marked reduction of tacrolimus dose (by 58. 7 %) and cost (by 56. 9 %). It also resulted in significant improvement in graft function and fungal skin infection, in addition to a decrease of gastrointestinal episodes and hospitalization. Conclusion.

The NPs were introduced as a pulse suspended in aqueous solutions and breakthrough curves in the column outlet were generated using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer. It was found that Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2 NPs are easily transported through limestone and dolomite porous media whereas NPs recoveries were achieved two times higher than those found in the quartz-sand. The highest and lowest SiO 2 -NPs recoveries were also achieved from the quartz-sand and limestone columns, respectively. The experimental results closely replicated the general trends predicted by the filtration and DLVO calculations.

However, recent disasters have highlighted the vulnerability of the built assets to natural disasters and therefore it is very much important to focus on creating a disaster resilient built environment within cities. However the process of making a disaster resilient built environment is a complex process where many challenges are involved.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To conduct {{formative}} assessment and preliminary biological {{impact of a}} school-based diabetes risk prevention program for African-American children during a 14 -week study. METHODS: NEEMA is a school-based diabetes prevention program tailored for African-American children. The NEEMA is implemented via four social networks-classroom (Health and Physical Education Class), after school (Health Club), home (Family Fun Fair) and school cafeteria (Food Service Program). Formative assessment data were collected through semistructured interviews with physical education (PE) teachers and a pre-to-post design {{was used to measure}} biological impact. Fasting capillary glucose, height, weight, body mass index, percent body fat and fitness data were collected from a sample of 58 fourth-grade students. The six elementary schools had > 40 % African-American enrollment and were located in low-income neighborhoods. RESULTS: Face-to-face interview data revealed diabetes, obesity and food insufficiency as major health concerns among PE teachers. Teachers also cited large classes and short PE periods <b>as</b> <b>major</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>for</b> implementing the program. From baseline to follow-up, fitness laps increased from 16. 40 (SD = 9. 98) to 23. 72 (SD = 14. 79) (p < 0. 000), fasting capillary glucose decreased from 89. 17 mg/dl (SD = 10. 05) to 83. 50 mg/dl (SD = 11. 26) (p < 0. 000), and percent body fat decreased from 27. 26 (SD= 12. 89) to 26. 68 (SD = 11. 67) (p < 0. 537).
