In 1749, development of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden was initiated. Designed by Nicolai Eigtved in the Rococo style, its centre contained the mansions which now form Amalienborg Palace. Major extensions to the naval base of Holmen were undertaken while the city's cultural importance was enhanced with the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts.|$|E

40|$|The light {{curve of}} GW 170817 is {{surprisingly}} blue and bright. Assuming {{that the event}} is a binary neutron star merger, we argue that blueness and brightness of the light curve {{is the result of}} ejecta that contains <b>an</b> <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> of thermal energy. To achieve this, the ejecta must be reheated at <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> distance (1 to 2000 solar radii) from the merger to avoid losing the energy to adiabatic cooling. We show that this reheating can occur if the merger occurs in a hierarchical triple system where the outer star has evolved and filled its Roche lobe. The outer star feeds mass to the inner binary, forming a circumbinary disc, driving the inner binary to merge. Because the outer star fills its Roche lobe, <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> fraction of the dynamical ejecta collides with the evolved star, reheating the ejecta in the process. We suggest that the process of mass transfer in heirarchical triples tends to form coplanar triple systems such as PSR J 0337 + 1715, and may provide electromagnetic counterparts to binary black hole mergers.
