25|$|With emotion {{still in}} his voice and eyes watering, Cronkite once again {{recapped}} the events after collecting himself, incorporating some wire photos of the visit and explaining {{the significance of the}} pictures now that Kennedy was dead. He reminded the viewers that Vice President Johnson was now the President and was to be sworn in, that Governor Connally's condition was still unknown, {{and that there was no}} report of whether the assassin had been captured. He then handed the anchor position to Charles Collingwood, who had just entered the newsroom, took his suit coat, <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> for a while.|$|E
500|$|In the summer, the privations of the captivity, {{including}} their closer confinement at the Ipatiev House negatively affected the family. According to some accounts, {{at one point}} Anastasia became so upset about the locked, painted windows that she opened one to look outside and get fresh air. A sentry reportedly saw her and fired, narrowly missing her. She did not try again. On July 14, 1918, local priests at Yekaterinburg conducted a private church service for the family. They reported that Anastasia and her family, contrary to custom, fell on their knees during the prayer for the dead, and that the girls had become despondent and hopeless, and no longer sang the replies in the service. Noticing this dramatic change in their demeanor since his last visit, one priest told the other, [...] "Something has happened to them in there." [...] But the next day, on July 15, 1918, Anastasia and her sisters appeared in good spirits as they joked and helped move the beds in their shared bedroom so that cleaning women could clean the floors. They helped the women scrub the floors and whispered to them when the guards weren't watching. Anastasia stuck her tongue out at Yakov Yurovsky, {{the head of the}} detachment, when he momentarily turned his back <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{day before}} Bradnum died, {{she had been}} doing {{housework}} and going for walks. The next morning she woke up feeling unwell. Adams was called and saw her. He gave her an injection and stated [...] "It will be over in three minutes". It was. Adams then confirmed [...] "I'm afraid she's gone" [...] <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Buckingham Palace {{stated that}} [...] "any {{suggestion}} of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue", later repeating the denials. Lawyers for Roberts claim {{a request to}} the Duke for a statement under oath about the allegations was returned unanswered. Further, when the Duke {{was asked if he}} planned to reply under oath, he refused to answer <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> The American government may also be trying to prevent the Duke having to testify under oath.|$|E
2500|$|... {{the boys}} who had the money won it in a fair game and they should keep it. He also {{said he had a}} hundred men who would stand behind him and see that they were protected. The judge finally told him he [...] could not afford to stand up for a gang of thieves, but he [...] almost screamed—“Well, Judge, declare me in with the thieves. I’ll stay with them,” and with that he passionately beat the table with his fist <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A more {{important}} pre-release viewing {{had to be}} held for Defense Minister Andrei Grechko and Yepishev. After the screening ended, the generals headed for the exit without saying a word. Ozerov asked for their opinion; Grechko answered, [...] "I will not say a word to you!" [...] <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> The film had to be edited four times before it was authorized for public screening on 1969, together with the already finished second part, Breakthrough. The two had their world premiere in July 1969, during the VI Moscow Film Festival.|$|E

2500|$|When Kennedy {{learned of}} the deaths during a White House meeting, he {{appeared}} shaken <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Kennedy later penned a memo, lamenting that the assassination was [...] "particularly abhorrent" [...] and blaming himself for approving Cable 243, which authorised Lodge to explore coup options {{in the wake of}} Nhu's attacks on the Buddhist pagodas. Kennedy's reaction did not draw unanimous sympathy. The Americans became aware later of the true reasons for the deaths of Diệm and Nhu through Conein. Later, photos appeared showing the two dead brothers covered in blood {{on the floor of the}} APC. The images appeared to be genuine, discrediting the generals' claims that the brothers had committed suicide.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interpreter}} {{warned the}} Texian officials {{that if he}} delivered that message, the Comanches would attempt to escape by fighting. [...] He was instructed to relay the warning <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{as soon as he}} finished translating. [...] After learning that they were being held hostage, the Comanches attempted to fight {{their way out of the}} room using arrows and knives. [...] The Texian soldiers opened fire at point-blank range, killing both Indians and whites. [...] The Comanche women and children waiting outdoors began firing their arrows after hearing the commotion inside. [...] At least one Texian spectator was killed. [...] When a small number of warriors managed to leave the council house, all of the Comanche began to flee. [...] The soldiers who followed again opened fire, killing and wounding both Comanche and Texians.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2017, Nyong'o {{wrote an}} op-ed with New York Times {{revealing}} that Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed her twice in 2011, {{while she was}} still a student at Yale School of Drama. She claimed that Weinstein led her to his bedroom and announced that he wanted to give her a complete body massage, which she declined and, panicked, offered him one. Nyong'o also claimed that Weinstein wanted to take off his pants, when she rejected his advances <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> terrified. Another encounter took place in New York, where she met with Weinstein for dinner after a screening. She quoted Weinstein: [...] "Let’s cut to the chase. I have a private room upstairs where we can have the rest of our meal." [...] She again declined and left the restaurant. She vowed that she would never work with Weinstein, hence her declining a role in Southpaw (2015). Nyong'o mentioned that she hasn't had any more encounters during her time in Hollywood and would rather work with women directors or male feminist directors, who have not abused their power.|$|E

2500|$|The {{interpreter}} {{warned the}} Texian officials {{that if he}} delivered this message the Comanches would attempt to escape by fighting. He was instructed to relay the message anyway <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{as soon as he}} finished translating. After learning that they were being held hostage, the Comanches attempted to fight {{their way out of the}} Council House using arrows and knives. The Texian soldiers opened fire at point-blank range, killing both Indians and whites. The Comanche women and children waiting outdoors began loosing arrows after hearing the commotion inside. At least one Texian spectator was killed. When a small number of warriors managed to escape from the Council House, all of the Comanche began to flee. The soldiers who pursued them again opened fire, killing and wounding both Comanche and Texians. Armed civilians also joined the battle but, claiming they could not always differentiate between warriors and women and children, since all of the Comanche were fighting, shot at them indiscriminately. According to Anderson, such [...] "confusion" [...] between Native American men and women was convenient to the Texians, who used it as an excuse to kill women and children.|$|E
2500|$|Gregory Doran's 2003 RSC {{production}} at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, starring Alexandra Gilbreath and Jasper Britton. This production was presented with Fletcher's The Tamer Tamed as a two-part piece, with Gilbreath also playing Maria, Petruchio's second wife, in Tamer Tamed. This was the first recorded production of Shrew and Tamer Tamed as a two piece since the seventeenth century. The play subsequently moved to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Britton played Petruchio not as a swaggering bully but as a shy and somewhat insecure individual deeply saddened by his father's death. When he first meets Katherina, she is in turmoil regarding the recent actions of her own father, and they recognise a kindred psychology in one another. Michael Billington wrote of the first meeting, [...] "I have never seen the scene more breathtakingly played: instead of barbaric knockabout, we see a damaged couple finding mutual support [...] in place of an offensive comedy about [...] "curative" [...] wife-taming, we see Kate trying to rescue a madman she genuinely loves." [...] Doran himself said of the play [...] "This is a play about love between two misfits, about their private relationship versus their public carapaces." [...] As such, Katherina here delivered her final speech with warmth and real affection for Petruchio, who admired her throughout. When she was finished, he emptied his bag of gold onto the table <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with Katherina, not the gold.|$|E
