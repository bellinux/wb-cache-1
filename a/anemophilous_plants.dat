25|$|Nasal allergy to pollen {{is called}} pollinosis, and allergy {{specifically}} to grass pollen is called hay fever. Generally, pollens that cause allergies {{are those of}} <b>anemophilous</b> <b>plants</b> (pollen is dispersed by air currents.) Such plants produce large quantities of lightweight pollen (because wind dispersal is random {{and the likelihood of}} one pollen grain landing on another flower is small), which can be carried for great distances and are easily inhaled, bringing it into contact with the sensitive nasal passages.|$|E
25|$|The {{transfer}} of pollen grains {{to the female}} reproductive structure (pistil in angiosperms) is called pollination. This transfer can be mediated by the wind, {{in which case the}} plant is described as anemophilous (literally wind-loving). <b>Anemophilous</b> <b>plants</b> typically produce great quantities of very lightweight pollen grains, sometimes with air-sacs. Non-flowering seed plants (e.g. pine trees) are characteristically anemophilous. Anemophilous flowering plants generally have inconspicuous flowers. Entomophilous (literally insect-loving) plants produce pollen that is relatively heavy, sticky and protein-rich, for dispersal by insect pollinators attracted to their flowers. Many insects and some mites are specialized to feed on pollen, and are called palynivores.|$|E

6000|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{quantity and}} lightness of the pollen of <b>anemophilous</b> <b>plants</b> {{are no doubt}} both necessary, as their pollen has generally to be carried to the stigmas of other and often distant flowers; for, as we shall soon see, most <b>anemophilous</b> <b>plants</b> have their sexes separated. The fertilisation of these plants is generally aided by the stigmas being of large size or plumose; {{and in the case}} of the Coniferae, by the naked ovules secreting a drop of fluid, as shown by Delpino. Although the number of anemophilous species is small, as the author just quoted remarks, the number of individuals is large in comparison with that of entomophilous species. This holds good especially in cold and temperate regions, where insects are not so numerous as under a warmer climate, and where consequently entomophilous plants are less favourably situated. We see this in our forests of Coniferae and other trees, such as oaks, beeches, birches, ashes, etc.; and in the Gramineae, Cyperaceae, and Juncaceae, which clothe our meadows and swamps; all these trees and plants being fertilised by the wind. As a large quantity of pollen is wasted by <b>anemophilous</b> <b>plants,</b> it is surprising that so many vigorous species of this kind abounding with individuals should still exist in any part of the world; for if they had been rendered entomophilous, their pollen would have been transported by the aid of the senses and appetites of insects with incomparably greater safety than by the wind. That such a conversion is possible can hardly be doubted, from the remarks lately made on the existence of intermediate forms; and apparently it has been effected in the group of willows, as we may infer from the nature of their nearest allies.

25|$|Many {{insects are}} pollinators, {{particularly}} bees, Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), wasps, flies, ants and beetles. On the other hand, some plants are generalists, being pollinated by insects in several orders. Entomophilous plant species have frequently evolved mechanisms {{to make themselves}} more appealing to insects, e.g., brightly coloured or scented flowers, nectar, or appealing shapes and patterns. Pollen grains of entomophilous plants are generally larger than the fine pollens of <b>anemophilous</b> (wind-pollinated) <b>plants,</b> which has to be produced in much larger quantities because such a high proportion is wasted. This is energetically costly, but in contrast, entomophilous plants have to bear the energetic costs of producing nectar.|$|R
6000|$|It {{seems at}} first sight a still more {{surprising}} fact that plants, after having been once rendered entomophilous, should ever again have become anemophilous; but this has occasionally though rarely occurred, for instance, with the common Poterium sanguisorba, as may be inferred from its belonging to the Rosaceae. Such cases are, however, intelligible, as almost all plants require to be occasionally intercrossed; and if any entomiphilous species ceased to be visited by insects, it would probably perish unless it were rendered <b>anemophilous.</b> A <b>plant</b> would be neglected by insects if nectar failed to be secreted, unless indeed a large supply of attractive pollen was present; and from {{what we have seen}} of the excretion of saccharine fluid from leaves and glands being largely governed in several cases by climatic influences, and from some few flowers which do not now secrete nectar still retaining coloured guiding-marks, the failure of the secretion cannot be considered as a very improbable event. The same result would follow to a certainty, if winged insects ceased to exist in any district, or became very rare. Now there is only a single plant in the great order of the Cruciferae, namely, Pringlea, which is <b>anemophilous,</b> and this <b>plant</b> is an inhabitant of Kerguelen Land, where there are hardly any winged insects, owing probably, as was suggested by me in the case of Madeira, to the risk which they run of being blown out to sea and destroyed.

60|$|It {{has long}} been known that this plant {{produces}} cleistogamic flowers, but these were first described with care by M. Duval-Jouve. (8/24. 'Bulletin Bot. Soc. de France' tome 10 1863 page 194.) I procured plants from a stream near Reigate, and cultivated them for several years in my greenhouse. The cleistogamic flowers are very small, and usually mature their seeds within the sheaths of the leaves. These flowers are said by Duval-Jouve to be filled by slightly viscid fluid; but {{this was not the case}} with several that I opened; but there was a thin film of fluid between the coats of the glumes, and when these were pressed the fluid moved about, giving a similarly deceptive appearance of the whole inside of the flower being thus filled. The stigma is very small and the filaments extremely short; the anthers are less than 1/50 of an inch in length or about one-third of the length of those in the perfect flowers. One of the three anthers dehisces before the two others. Can this have any relation with the fact that in some other species of Leersia only two stamens are fully developed? (8/25. Asa Gray 'Manual of Botany of the United States' 1856 page 540.) The anthers shed their pollen on the stigma; at least in one instance this was clearly the case, and by tearing open the anthers under water the grains were easily detached. Towards the apex of the anther the grains are arranged in a single row and lower down in two or three rows, so that they could be counted; and there were about 35 in each cell, or 70 in the whole anther; and this is an astonishingly small number for an <b>anemophilous</b> <b>plant.</b> The grains have very delicate coats, are spherical and about 5/7000 of an inch (.0181 millimetres), whilst those of the perfect flowers are about 7/7000 of an inch (.0254 millimetres) in diameter.|$|R

60|$|The {{amount of}} pollen {{produced}} by <b>anemophilous</b> <b>plants,</b> {{and the distance}} {{to which it is}} often transported by the wind, are both surprisingly great. Mr. Hassall found that the weight of pollen produced by a single plant of the Bulrush (Typha) was 144 grains. Bucketfuls of pollen, chiefly of Coniferae and Gramineae, have been swept off the decks of vessels near the North American shore; and Mr. Riley has seen the ground near St. Louis, in Missouri, covered with pollen, as if sprinkled with sulphur; and there was good reason to believe that this had been transported from the pine-forests at least 400 miles to the south. Kerner has seen the snow-fields on the higher Alps similarly dusted; and Mr. Blackley found numerous pollen-grains, in one instance 1200, adhering to sticky slides, which were sent up to a height of from 500 to 1000 feet by means of a kite, and then uncovered by a special mechanism. It is remarkable that in these experiments there were on an average nineteen times as many pollen-grains in the atmosphere at the higher than at the lower levels. (10/54. For Mr. Hassall's observations see 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' volume 8 1842 page 108. In the 'North American Journal of Science' January 1842, there is an account of the pollen swept off the decks of a vessel. Riley 'Fifth Report on the Noxious Insects of Missouri' 1873 page 86. Kerner 'Die Schutzmittel des Pollens' 1873 page 6. This author has also seen a lake in the Tyrol so covered with pollen, that the water no longer appeared blue. Mr. Blackley 'Experimental Researches on Hay-fever' 1873 pages 132, 141-152.) Considering these facts, it is not so surprising as it at first appears that all, or nearly all, the stigmas of <b>anemophilous</b> <b>plants</b> should receive pollen brought to them by mere chance by the wind. During the early part of summer every object is thus dusted with pollen; for instance, I examined for another purpose the labella {{of a large number of}} flowers of the Fly Ophrys (which is rarely visited by insects), and found on all very many pollen-grains of other plants, which had been caught by their velvety surfaces.|$|E
6000|$|There is {{no great}} {{difficulty}} in understanding how an anemophilous plant {{might have been}} rendered entomophilous. Pollen is a nutritious substance, and would soon have been discovered and devoured by insects; and if any adhered to their bodies {{it would have been}} carried from the anthers to the stigma of the same flower, or from one flower to another. One of the chief characteristics of the pollen of <b>anemophilous</b> <b>plants</b> is its incoherence; but pollen in this state can adhere to the hairy bodies of insects, as we see with some Leguminosae, Ericaceae, and Melastomaceae. We have, however, better evidence of the possibility of a transition of the above kind in certain plants being now fertilised partly by the wind and partly by insects. The common rhubarb (Rheum rhaponticum) is so far in an intermediate condition, that I have seen many Diptera sucking the flowers, with much pollen adhering to their bodies; and yet the pollen is so incoherent, that clouds of it are emitted if the plant be gently shaken on a sunny day, some of which could hardly fail to fall on the large stigmas of the neighbouring flowers. According to Delpino and Hermann Muller, some species of Plantago are in a similar intermediate condition. (10/44. 'Die Befruchtung' etc. page 342.) ...|$|E

60|$|Instead of {{the first}} change {{occurring}} in the female organs we may suppose that the male ones first varied, so that some individuals produced a larger supply of pollen.

The increased action of the male organs would tend to affect through compensation the female organs of the same flower; and the final result would be that the species would consist of males and hermaphrodites.

50|$|Anemophily or wind {{pollination}} {{is a form}} of pollination whereby pollen {{is distributed}} by wind. Almost all gymnosperms are anemophilous, as are many plants in the order Poales, including grasses, sedges and rushes.

50|$|The nutritious Pollen {{from plants}} adapted to such pollinators {{contrasts}} with the also copious pollen from specialist <b>anemophilous</b> <b>plants.</b> Strict anemophiles commonly produce pollen that is low in nutritive value, since it is not adapted to attract or feed pollinators.

5000|$|Anemophilous pollen grains {{are light}} and non-sticky, {{so that they}} can be transported by air currents.

Pollen from <b>anemophilous</b> <b>plants</b> tends to be smaller and lighter than pollen from entomophilous ones, with very low nutritional value to insects. However, insects sometimes gather pollen from staminate anemophilous flowers at times when higher-protein pollens from entomophilous flowers are scarce. Anemophilous pollens may also be inadvertently captured by bees' electrostatic field. This may explain why, though bees are not observed to visit ragweed flowers, its pollen is often found in honey made during the ragweed floral bloom. Other flowers that are generally anemophilous are observed to be actively worked by bees, with solitary bees often visiting grass flowers, and the larger honeybees and bumblebees frequently gathering pollen from corn tassels and other grains.|$|E

50|$|Females spend between 80 and 95% {{of their}} time {{invested}} for preparing cells in foraging. O. bicornis has shown a strong inclination towards collecting pollen from maple and oak trees, like most other solitary bees. These bees require nectar along with pollen, and while maple provides both, oak provides only pollen. Those females that collect pollen from oak trees must also collect nectar from other plant sources. While the species is polylectic, females temporarily and locally forage {{on one or two}} plant species with great pollen abundance to maximize pollen mass collected per unit time. This is done to reduce provisioning time to exploit as much pollen as possible {{in a short period of}} time during unstable environmental conditions in the spring and to reduce the risk of open-cell parasitism. Pollen diversity has shown no effect on the developmental success of O. bicornis offspring, hence it is more beneficial for females to maximize pollen mass from a few species than to regard pollen diversity. Protein consumption is one of the major factors influencing the growth of bees. Since maple and oak pollen have similar protein content (with a deviation up to 5%), larvae reared on the diet of either plant do not differ in cocoon weight - hence the offspring of O. bicornis develop equally on the pollen of both zoophilous and <b>anemophilous</b> <b>plants.</b> When oak and maple are no longer in bloom, the bees tend to forage on pollen from poppy and buttercup plants.|$|E

The sudden release of stored elastic energy in the spring-like filament drove the stamen to straighten in less than 25 μs, and reflex the petals to velocities in excess of half the speed of sound.

40|$|Ephedra (Gnetales) is a {{gymnosperm}} genus {{with a long}} evolutionary history; {{the first}} dispersed pollen grains with affinity to the group are known already from the Permian. This thesis focuses on the evolutionary history {{of the group and}} different aspects of its pollination mechanisms. Despite the limited number of extant species of the genus (50 - 60), and a low morphological and genetic divergence among species, there is variation in pollination syndrome in the genus. The prevailing state in Ephedra, and most gymnosperms, is wind pollination. It is therefore surprising that one species, E. foeminea, is insect-pollinated. Together with co-workers I documented the pollination syndromes of E. foeminea and a sympatric species, E. distachya, based on long term field experiments in north-eastern Greece and aerodynamic investigations and calculations. Placing the results into an evolutionary framework reveals that the insect-pollinated species E. foeminea is sister to the remaining (mostly wind-pollinated) genus, and indicates that insect pollination is the ancestral state in the Gnetales. During the course of evolution of the group there has been a shift to wind pollination, which may have played a crucial role for the diversification of the crown group in the Paleogene. Pollination biology is often correlated with the morphology of the pollen such that pollen grains of <b>anemophilous</b> <b>plants</b> are small with a smooth surface, whereas pollen grains of entomophilous plants are larger with an ornamented surface and a covering of pollenkitt. The pollen morphology of Ephedra can be broadly divided into two types: an ancestral type with an unbranched pseudosulcus between each pair of plicae, and a derived type with a branched pseudosulcus between each pair of plicae. Further, the pollen morphology and ultrastructure of the pollen wall in Ephedra are to some degree correlated with the pollination syndrome and capability of long distance dispersal. Pollen of E. foeminea has a denser ultrastructure, as a result a higher settling velocity and is therefore capable of flying shorter distances than does pollen of the anemophilous E. distachya, and other investigated anemophilous species that show a more spacious ultrastructure of the pollen grain. These results can be useful in the reconstruction of the pollination mechanism of extinct taxa of the Ephedra-lineage in the future...|$|E

The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the relationship between the flowering phases in eight Alnus taxa and the {{dynamics of}} occurrence and abundance of airborne pollen grains as well as the meteorological factors (maximum and minimum temperature, relative air humidity, maximum wind speed, and precipitation). The flowering phenophases and pollen seasons were studied in 2008 – 2011. Phenological observations of flowering were conducted in the Maria Curie-Skłodowska University Botanical Garden in Lublin and they involved the following taxa: Alnus crispa var. mollis, A. glutinosa, A. incana, A. incana ‘Aurea’, A. incana ‘Pendula’, A. maximowiczii, A. rubra and A. subcordata. Spearman’s r correlation coefficients were calculated in order to determine the relationship between the dynamics of inflorescence development and meteorological conditions. Aerobiological monitoring using the gravimetric method was employed in the determination of Alnus pollen content in the air. The annual phenological cycles in 2008 - 2011 varied distinctly in terms of the time of onset of successive flowering phases in the Alnus taxa studied, which depended largely on the taxonomic rank and meteorological factors. The following flowering sequence was revealed in the 2008 - 2011 growing seasons: A. subcordata (December or January), A. incana ‘Pendula’, A. incana, A. maximowiczii, A. rubra, A. glutinosa, A. incana ‘Aurea’ (February or March), and A. crispa var. mollis (April). The study demonstrated that the pollen of the taxa persisted in the air, on average, from mid-December to early May. The mean length of the flowering period, which coincided with various phases of the pollen season, was 17 days. The Alnus pollen season in 2008 started at the end of January and lasted until mid-March. In 2009, 2010, and 2011, the beginning of the pollen season was recorded in the first week of March and the end in the first week of April. The maximum concentration of airborne Alnus pollen was found at the full bloom stage of mainly A. glutinosa and A. rubra.
