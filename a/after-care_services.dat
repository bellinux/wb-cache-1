By the 1960 s, a time of change for probation (Whitehead and Statham, 2006), the Advisory Council on the Treatment of Offenders published its report on after-care that had a significant impact on the relationship between probation and prisons (Home Office, 1963).

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (MW)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to develop guidelines for <b>after-care</b> <b>services</b> for rehabilitated alcoholics, in order to render a more effective support service towards the rehabilitated alcoholic on his way to full recovery. The necessity of the research project originated on account of a lack of knowledge among social workers on the need of the rehabilitated alcoholic towards after-care service and the specific nature that <b>after-care</b> <b>services</b> have to contain. A literature overview of <b>after-care</b> <b>services</b> was given to the alcoholic, as a background for the empirical study of the project. The literature study showed that <b>after-care</b> <b>services</b> {{as an integral part of}} the total rehabilitation of the alcoholic is conceptualized. Further out of the literature came to light that social workers have a resistance against the delivering of <b>after-care</b> <b>services</b> and that they experience feelings of discourage regarding the alcoholic. The empirical study confirmed that social workers experience resistance against giving <b>after-care</b> <b>services</b> to rehabilitated alcoholics. Further they don't consider this as part of their task and they give a low priority towards the rendering of <b>after-care</b> <b>services.</b> In spite of this, the necessity of <b>after-care</b> <b>services</b> is being realized by the social workers. Alcoholics who are standing on the point of being discharged from the rehabilitation center have a need for <b>after-care</b> <b>services</b> to help them adapt in the community. They especially have a need for individual contact with a professional person and do not want to be part of only a self-help group. Among the alcoholics who are already functioning in the community after treatment, the particular need of the female alcoholic came forward. This group feels that their family and spouse do not truly have an idea of their needs. Further there was a need among the rehabilitated alcoholics to know who will be responsible for their <b>after-care</b> <b>services.</b> This group would have wanted to be prepared on possible risky situations and ways of handling these situations. The research showed that there is a shortcoming in the practice concerning the rendering of aftercare service. Guidelines were formulated from which more effective <b>after-care</b> <b>services</b> could be given to rehabilitated alcoholics. Master...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} <b>after-care</b> <b>services</b> in the corporate ‘repeat-investment’ process at foreign-owned establishments (FOEs) in Wales – a region of the UK which has attracted {{a significant number of}} inward investors. With the growing importance of repeat investment in peripheral regions, development agencies increasingly seek to support foreign production establishments with ‘after-care services’, such as supply-chain initiatives and lobbying corporate HQs. In this paper the corporate processes that influence the role and importance of regional <b>after-care</b> <b>services</b> are examined. Building upon an understanding of multinational enterprises as differentiated entities, the analysis centres on the repeat-investment process at two FOEs where after-care was important, and two FOEs where it was irrelevant. A heterogeneous range of corporate processes which are mostly beyond the authority of FOEs are found to influence the importance of <b>after-care</b> <b>services.</b> Such processes are related to the wider corporate context in which production establishments operate, suggesting that regions are being tied into important scalar processes of institutionalization with corporate processes functioning at much broader socio-spatial scales. This raises important questions {{about the extent to which}} regions can influence corporate processes, given their multi-scalar nature, and suggests that there should be greater emphasis on the broader political economy in which regions are embedded, one aspect of which is the (asymmetrical) power relations between regional development agencies and multinational enterprises...|$|E

With regard to the considerable growth of re-admissions to mental hospitals, I pointed out in a previous report that this trend, which is not peculiar to this country, indicated that more serious consideration would have to be given to <b>after-care</b> <b>services.</b> <b>After-care</b> <b>services</b> in this country generally leave a lot to be desired and inadequate supportive care in the community results in many former patients having to return to hospital for treatment.

40|$|Objective: Hospital-treated {{deliberate}} self-poisoning (DSP) {{is common}} and the existing national monitoring systems are often deficient. Clinical Practice Guidelines (UK and Australia) recommend universal psychosocial assessment within the general hospital as standard care. We compared presentation rates, patient characteristics, psychosocial assessment and aftercare in UK and Australia. Methods: We used a cross sectional design, for a ten year study of all DSP presentations identified through sentinel units in Oxford, UK (n. = 3042) and Newcastle, Australia (n. = 3492). Results: Oxford had higher presentation rates for females (standardised rate ratio 2. 4 : CI 99 % 1. 9, 3. 2) and males (SRR 2. 5 : CI 99 % 1. 7, 3. 5). Female to male ratio was 1. 6 : 1, 70 % presented after-hours, 95 % were {{admitted to a}} general hospital and co-ingestion of alcohol occurred in a substantial minority (Oxford 24 %, Newcastle 32 %). Paracetamol, minor tranquilisers and antidepressants were the commonest drug groups ingested, although the overall pattern differed.

40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} extent to which medical {{coverage}} is available to discharged leprosy patients in communities. Evidence has shown that after care services, follow-up visits and national disease prevention programs are important components of medical rehabilitation to leprosy patients discharged home after treatment. Denying them accessibility to these services could expose them to multiple disabilities as well as several disease conditions including HIV/AIDS. These adverse health conditions could be averted if health workers extend healthcare services to discharged leprosy patients. This study was conducted to examine {{the extent to}} which discharged leprosy patients have access to healthcare services in the communities. Methods: All 33 leprosy patients who were fully treated with multidrug therapy (MDT) and discharged home in the two leprosy settlements in Abia and Ebonyi States of Nigeria were included in this study. The list of discharged leprosy patients studied and their addresses were provided by the leprosy settlements where they were treated. Also, snowball-sampling method was used to identify some of the leprosy patients whose addresses were difficult to locate in the communities. Instruments for data collection were questionnaire, interview guide and checklist. These were administered because respondents were essentially those with no formal education. Analysis of data was done quantitatively and qualitatively. Results: Findings showed that 20 (60. 6 � 20 of discharged patients did not receive health programs like HIV/AIDS prevention or family planning.

40|$|Personal health budgets (PHBs) in England {{have been}} viewed {{as a vehicle for}} {{developing}} a personalised patient-based strategy within the substance misuse care pathway. In 2009, the Department of Health announced a 3 -year pilot programme of PHBs to explore opportunities offered by this new initiative across a number of long-term health conditions, and commissioned an independent evaluation to run alongside as well as a separate study involving two pilot sites that were implementing PHBs within the substance misuse service. The study included a quantitative and qualitative strand. The qualitative strand involved 20 semi-structured interviews among organisational representatives at two time points (10 at each time point) between 2011 and 2012 which are the focus for this current paper. Overall, organisational representatives believed that PHBs had a positive impact on budget-holders with a drug and/or alcohol misuse problem, their families and the health and social care system. However, a number of concerns were discussed, many of which seemed to stem from the initial change management process during the early implementation stage of the pilot programme. This study provides guidance on how to implement and offer PHBs within the substance misuse care pathway: individuals potentially would benefit from receiving their PHB post-detox rather than at a crisis point; PHBs have the potential to improve the link to <b>after-care</b> <b>services,</b> and direct payments can provide greater choice and control, but sufficient protocols are required...|$|E
40|$|The {{reconfiguration}} of the state’s regulatory capacity, {{along with}} the increasing ‘relativization of scale ’ as economic and social processes increasingly operate within and across many different sociospatial scales, has led to growing interspatial competition {{and the search for}} a new ‘spatial fix ’ to regulate capital (Brenner and Theodore, 2002). In certain places the response to these processes has been the emergence of autonomous institutional capacity building and various development strategies, involving activities such as the promotion of interfirm networks (Hudson, et al., 1997). Within ‘new regionalist ’ accounts, the region has been highlighted as a container of such institutional capacity (Morgan, 1997; MacLeod, 2001). One such example of developing regional institutional capacity is that of <b>after-care</b> <b>services,</b> operating through regional development agencies (RDAs), such as the Welsh Development Agency (WDA), which are designed to support, upgrade and embed existing foreign-owned establishments (FOEs) (MacKinnon and Phelps, 2001 a). 1 Young and Hood (1994 : 51) define ‘after-care ’ as ‘all potential services offered at the company level by government and its agencies designed to facilitate both the successful start up and the continuing development of a multinational affiliate [...] . with a view to maximising the local economic development contribution of that affiliate’.

40|$|IMPORTANCE Suicidal {{behavior}} has increased since {{the onset of}} the global recession, a trend that may have long-term health and social implications. OBJECTIVE To test whether suicide attempts among young people signal increased risk for later poor health and social functioning above and beyond a preexisting psychiatric disorder. DESIGN We followed up a cohort of young people and assessed multiple aspects of their health and social functioning as they approached midlife. Outcomes among individuals who had self-reported a suicide attempt up through age 24 years (young suicide attempters) were compared with those who reported no attempt through age 24 years (nonattempters). Psychiatric history and social class were controlled for. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS The population-representative Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, which involved 1037 birth cohort members comprising 91 young suicide attempters and 946 nonattempters, 95 % of whom were followed up to age 38 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Outcomes were selected to represent significant individual and societal costs: mental health, physical health, harm toward others, and need for support. RESULTS As adults approaching midlife, young suicide attempters {{were significantly more likely to}} have persistent mental health problems (eg, depression, substance dependence, and additional suicide attempts) compared with nonattempters. They were also more likely to have physical health problems (eg, metabolic syndrome and elevated inflammation). They engaged in more violence (eg, violent crime and intimate partner abuse) and needed more social support (eg, long-term welfare receipt and unemployment). Furthermore, they reported being lonelier and less satisfied with their lives. These associations remained after adjustment for youth psychiatric diagnoses and social class. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Many young suicide attempters remain vulnerable to costly health and social problems into midlife. As rates of suicidal behavior rise with the continuing global recession, additional suicide prevention efforts and long-term monitoring and <b>after-care</b> <b>services</b> are needed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{traces the}} {{dramatic}} rise of psychiatric emergency services (PES) and crisis intervention services over recent decades. It examines three processes [...] {{the evolution of}} such services, their adaptation to diverse settings, and the striking increase both {{in the number of}} programs and their utilization. PES first evolved along three disparate lines [...] makeshift psychiatric emergency care in the emergency room of the general hospital, ad hoc <b>after-care</b> <b>services</b> in the psychiatric hospital, and the community mental health movement. Community mental health legislation of the 1960 s not only provided funds for PES but led to the merging of the three lines. PES have adapted to and are found in a great variety of settings. The latter include small general hospitals and huge medical centers; county, state, and private mental hospitals; free clinics; telephone hot-lines, and others. Their adaptability appears due to their flexible requirements and lack of need for an elaborate technology. Although fewer than 160 facilities were known to offer PES in 1963, their number exceeded 2000 by the early 1980 s. Available piecemeal data indicate constantly increasing utilization of PES. This is a result of many factors, including deinstitutionalization. Although PES were initially visualized as resources for acute mental health care and continue to serve as such, they have become increasingly chronicized, consequent on the deinstitutionalized abandonment of many chronically ill persons. Changes are also occurring in the social and demographic characteristics of persons utilizing PES and in {{the ways in which the}} services are perceived and utilized. The early development of unlabeled and makeshift psychiatric emergency care in the general hospital's emergency room and the psychiatric hospital were instances of 'evolutionary planning'. That is, in the face of mounting environmental demands, internal organizational strains, or other situational pressures, the organization adopted some expedient accommodations [...] modifying things only enough to maintain the essential system as it was. Currently, in the face of deinstitutionalization, policy shifts, and federal and state cutbacks in funding, new forms of evolutionary planning are emerging among facilities that provide PES. psychiatric emergency service emergency services deinstitutionalization community mental health chronically mentally ill...|$|E
40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Rising cancer {{incidence}} and survival {{mean that the}} number of cancer survivors is growing. Accumulating evidence suggests many survivors have long-term medical and supportive care needs, and that these needs vary by survivors&# 8217; socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. To illustrate how cancer registry data may be useful in survivorship care service planning, we generated population-based estimates of cancer prevalence in Ireland and described socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the survivor population. 				 				 					 						Methods 					Details of people diagnosed with invasive cancer (ICD 10 C 00 -C 96) during 1994 &# 8211; 2011, and who were still alive on 31 / 12 / 2011, were abstracted from the National Cancer Registry, and tabulated by cancer site, sex, current age, marital status, initial treatment, and time since diagnosis. Associations were investigated using chi-square tests. 				 				 					 						Results 					After excluding non-melanoma skin cancers, 17 -year cancer prevalence in Ireland was 112, 610 (females: 58, 054 (52 %) males: 54, 556 (48 %)). The four most prevalent cancers among females were breast (26, 066), colorectum (6, 598), melanoma (4, 593) and uterus (3, 505) and among males were prostate (23, 966), colorectum (8, 207), lymphoma (3, 236) and melanoma (2, 774). At the end of 2011, 39 % of female survivors were aged < 60 and 35 % were &# 8805; 70 compared to 25 % and 46 % of males (p < 0. 001). More than half of survivors of bladder, colorectal and prostate cancer were &# 8805; 70. Cancers with the highest percentages of younger (< 40) survivors were: testis (50 %); leukaemia (females: 28 %; males: 22 %); cervix (20 %); and lymphoma (females: 19 %; males: 20 %). Fewer female (57 %) than male (64 %) survivors were married but the percentage single was similar (17 - 18 %). More female (25 %) than male survivors (18 %; p <&# 8201; 0. 001) were &# 8805; 10 &# 160;years from diagnosis. Overall, 69 % of survivors had undergone cancer-directed surgery, and 39 %, 32 % and 18 % had received radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy, respectively.

40|$|This sixth {{national}} report {{provides an}} overview of 269 Australian Government-funded organisations that aim to improve the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It presents findings from the 2013 - 14 Online Services Report data collection, including the health services and activities provided by these organisations, staffing levels and client numbers, as well as health service gaps and challenges faced by the communities they serve. In 2013 - 14, most (79 %) of these organisations delivered health services through 1 site, with the remaining having 2 or more delivery sites. Sixty-two per cent of organisations were Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations, 14 % were other non-government organisations and 24 % were government-run organisations. Three-quarters (76 %) of organisations were accredited against either the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners or organisational standards. This was higher than in 2012 - 13 (70 %). More staff and more client contacts in primary health-care organisations In 2013 - 14, 203 of these organisations (76 %) provided primary health-care services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, similar to the number in 2012 - 13 (205). The number of full-time equivalent staff employed at 30 June 2014 was 7, 108 and just over half of these were Indigenous (53 %). The number of staff was 7 % higher than at 30 June 2013. Primary health-care services were provided to around 419, 000 clients through 4. 6 million contacts. The number of contacts increased by 13 % (around 543, 000) compared with 2012 - 13. There were large increases in the number of contacts for allied health professionals (46 %), nurses and midwives (30 %) and doctors (10 %). This may partly reflect increases in the number of staff in 2013 - 14. The number of clients was similar in 2012 - 13 (around 417, 000). Most counsellors providing social and emotional wellbeing or Link Up counselling services were Indigenous In 2013 - 14, 95 organisations (35 %) provided social and emotional wellbeing or Link Up counselling services. These organisations employed 189 counsellors and 62 % of these were Indigenous. Services were provided to around 16, 600 clients through 88, 200 contacts. Substance-use episodes of care increase In 2013 - 14, 56 organisations (21 %) provided substance-use services. Around 43, 000 clients were seen through 371, 000 episodes of care. Most episodes of care (95 %) were for non-residential, follow-up or <b>after-care</b> <b>services.</b> Episodes of care increased by 22 % (around 66, 000) compared with 2012 - 13, largely due to {{an increase in the number}} of non-residential episodes of care. Key gaps and challenges Sixty-one per cent of all organisations reported a service delivery gap in their communities for mental health and social and emotional health and wellbeing. Recruitment, training and support of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff (68 %) and staffing levels (58 %) were commonly reported as challenges to providing quality services...|$|E
40|$|Summary This seventh {{national}} report presents {{information from}} 278 organisations across Australia, {{funded by the}} Australian Government to provide {{one or more of}} the following health services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people: primary health care, maternal and child health care, social and emotional wellbeing services, and substance-use services. These organisations participated in the 2014 – 15 Online Services Report data collection. Information is presented on the characteristics of these organisations, the health services and activities provided to clients and staffing levels. Other information presented includes client numbers, client contacts and episodes of care, and service gaps and challenges. Primary health client contacts increased 	In 2014 – 15, 203 of the organisations (73 %) were funded to provide primary health-care services and many of these were Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations (138 or 68 %). 	These organisations employed 7, 359 full-time equivalent staff and just over half (53 %) were Indigenous, a similar proportion to 2013 – 14 (53 %). The workforce was made up of 4, 454 health staff (61 %) and 2, 905 other staff (39 %). Nurses and midwives were the most common type of health worker, representing 15 % of employed staff. This was followed by Aboriginal health workers (11 %) and doctors (6 %). However, the relative proportions of these varied by remoteness area, with more nurses and midwives being employed in Very remote areas (39 %) and more Aboriginal health workers in Outer regional areas (31 %). 	Health staff provided primary health-care services to around 434, 600 clients through 5. 0 million client contacts. Since 2013 – 14, client contacts increased by 9 %. Although the number of staff per 1, 000 clients was similar to 2013 – 14 (18 per 1, 000 clients), the number of contacts per client showed a small increase and continued an upward trend in average contacts per client overtime, which has gone from 7. 7 in 2008 – 09 to 11. 6 in 2014 – 15. An average of nearly 5 antenatal visits per woman In 2014 – 15, 220 of the organisations (79 %) provided maternal and child health services, either through primary health or New Directions funding. Around 34, 100 antenatal visits were reported for 7, 400 Indigenous women, an average of 4. 6 visits per woman. Around 22, 100 child health checks were conducted for Indigenous children aged 0 – 4 years. More social and emotional wellbeing counsellors In 2014 – 15, 97 of the organisations (35 %) were funded to provide social and emotional wellbeing services. They employed 221 counsellors, an increase of 17 % compared with 2013 – 14. Around 60 % of counsellors were Indigenous, a similar proportion to 2013 – 14 (62 %). Services were provided to around 21, 100 clients through 100, 200 client contacts. Amphetamines seen as an important substance-use issue In 2014 – 15, 67 of the organisations (24 %) were funded to provide substance-use services. They saw around 25, 200 clients through 151, 000 episodes of care. Most episodes of care (89 %) were for non-residential or <b>after-care</b> <b>services.</b> The proportion of these organisations that reported amphetamines as one of their most important issues in terms of staff time and organisational resources increased from 45 % in 2013 – 14 to 70 % in 2014 – 15...|$|E
40|$|Executive summary 1. The {{personal}} health budget initiative {{is a key}} aspect of personalisation across health care services in England. Its aim is to improve patient outcomes, by placing patients at the centre of decisions about their care. 2. In 2009 the Department of Health invited PCTs to become pilot sites to join a programme which would explore the opportunities offered by {{personal health}} budgets. The Department of Health commissioned an independent evaluation to run alongside the pilot programme to provide information on how personal health budgets are best implemented, where {{and when they are}} most appropriate, and what support is required for individuals. 3. Two pilot sites within the pilot programme explored whether personal health budgets had an impact on outcomes and experiences compared to conventional service delivery among individuals with substance misuse problems. Study design and methodology 4. The evaluation adopted a longitudinal approach, and included people with drug and/or alcohol addiction. 5. The study used a controlled trial with a pragmatic design to compare the experiences of people receiving a personal health budget with the experiences of people continuing under the current substance misuse treatment support arrangements. After applying initial selection criteria, in one pilot site people were randomised into the personal health budget group or a control group. In the second pilot site, the personal health budget group was recruited from patients of those health care professionals in the pilot offering budgets, and a control group was recruited from patients of nonparticipating health care professionals. 6. A mixed design was followed where both quantitative and qualitative methodologies were used to explore patient outcomes and experiences, service use and costs, as well as the experiences of those implementing the initiative. In total, an active sample of 166 participants was recruited: 119 in the personal health budget group and 47 in the control group. Within the active study sample, 55 participants had drug and alcohol addictions and 111 participants had an alcohol addiction only. 7. The qualitative analysis involved interviews with personal health budget holders and organisational representatives. Data were analysed using the framework approach, with the data organised by themes according to the topic guides used in the interviews. 8. The difference-in-difference approach was used to explore whether personal health budgets had an impact on an individual’s quality of life and relapse rates. The analysis subtracted an individual’s follow-up outcome scores from their baseline score. Due to the small sample size, the analysis did not include exploring difference-in-difference multivariate models and therefore we were unable to control for confounding baseline differences. The content of support plans 9. Among the personal health budget group, 103 support plans were returned from the two pilot sites. In terms {{of the size of the}} budget, 41 budgets were worth between £ 1, 000 and £ 5, 000 per year, while 4 budgets were worth more than £ 10, 000. 2 10. The majority of care/support plans were managed notionally. While one of the pilot sites did have approval to offer direct payments, we did not find evidence this deployment was offered during the pilot programme. 11. Residential detox was the largest single cost category. The more innovative uses of the personal health budget included driving lessons, alternative therapies, leisure activities and educational courses. Enabling people to access community detox rather than residential detox could also be regarded as an innovative use of their budget. The impact of personal health budgets on relapse rates, quality of life and service quality 12. The shortened version of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) was used to detect signs of hazardous and harmful drinking. Difference-in-difference analysis indicated that individuals in the personal health budget group had reduced their excessive drinking at follow-up compared to those in the control group. Similar results were found with the change in drug consumption at followup. 13. Difference-in-difference analysis indicated that there were greater improvements in care-related quality of life (ASCOT) and psychological well-being (GHQ 12) for individuals in the personal health budget group compared to those in the control group, although the difference was not statistically significant. 14. Individuals in the personal health budget group were more satisfied with the help paid for by the budget and the care/support planning process than those receiving conventional services. 15. While the quantitative results highlighted the positive impact of receiving a personal health budget, firm conclusions around the impact of personal health budgets compared to conventional service delivery could not be made, due to the small sample size. Views from patients 16. Qualitative in-depth interviews indicated that personal health budgets had a positive impact on service quality, relationships with health professionals and views on what could be achieved compared with conventional service detox delivery. 17. The importance of effective implementation was highlighted, both in terms of providing the necessary information to enable budget holders to make an informed choice and also to minimise any delays in the process of obtaining and using a budget. Individuals reported that delays could potentially lead to anxiety and distress. 18. A list of suggestions of possible uses of personal health budgets would have been useful during the support/care planning stage. 19. Personal budget holders reported a lack of <b>after-care</b> <b>services</b> available with this treatment route which could potentially have a longer-term impact on relapse rates. This desire for post-detox care to prevent relapse was especially prevalent at follow-up, when patients had completed their detoxification and required relapse prevention services. 20. Individuals receiving conventional detox services expressed more negative views of the relationship they had with health professionals and their experiences of services. Views from the system 21. Organisational representatives believed that personal health budgets had a positive impact on outcomes for budget holders: the way they accessed services, and to a certain extent the content or 3 quality of those services. Organisational representatives attributed these impacts to the personal health budgets enabling: increased choice and control for budget holders; increased flexibility; encouraging innovation and creativity; greater ‘person-centred’ care/support planning; and the opportunity to reduce costs by accessing alternative services or providers of services. 22. A number of challenges within the implementation process were mentioned by organisational representatives. These included: the length of time required to conduct the care/support planning process; the time point at which a personal health budget should be introduced; deciding what can and cannot be included, in particular considering whether the budget should be used for relapse prevention; managing attitudes to risk and the cultural change required for patients in the system; the logistics of managing multi-agencies involved in a person’s care; and establishing integration between services and creating a jointly-funded budget. Recommendations for policy and practice 23. A number of recommendations can be made regarding a possible roll-out of personal health budgets within the area of substance misuse from the results of this study:  Personal health budgets increased service satisfaction, facilitated a positive relationship with health professionals and improved quality of life supporting a wider roll-out.  The budget-holders we interviewed emphasised the value of information and guidance from operational representatives about the size and operation of their budgets, including what services were covered.  Direct payments were viewed as playing a critical role in the success of personal health budgets for people with substance misuse problems. However, managing the anxiety and practical challenges around offering this deployment option may need consideration...|$|E
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{historical}} development {{of the relationship between the}} Dutch Government and the private after-care and rehabilitation organisations from 1823 until today. The first chapter covers the period that starts with the foundation of The Dutch Fellowship for Moral Reformation of Prisoners (Het Nederlandsch Genootschap tot Zedelijke Verbetering der Gevangenen, hereafter referred to as ’the Fellow-ship’) in 1823, and ends with the introduction of the new Penal Code in 1886. The foundation of the Fellowship reflects the social and political climate of the first quarter of the nineteenth century. The Central Government played only a limited role in public life. Social care was primarily the responsibilty of private initiative and local authorities, who, throughout the nineteenth century were often one and the same people. This applied also to branch committees of the Fellowship and prison boards. Faith in the possibility of moral edification of the population in general and of the justitiable in particular, was a legacy of the ’Age of reason’. In the second quarter of the nineteenth century the Central Government gave the Fellowship more or less carte blanche. In particular, the education of detainees became increasingly the responsibility of private initiative. As the Government became more and more convinced of the usefulness of the aims that the Fellowship pursued, its work became less discretionary. Around the middle of the nineteenth century, when the discussion over the introduction of solitary confinement was taking place, the Department of Justice and the Fellowship shared the same ideals. However, when it proved politically impossible to introduce solitary confinement on a large scale, the views of the Government and of the Fellowship gradually began to diverge. This divergence was increased as the Government became more interested in progressive systems of detention, whereas the Fellowship remained faithful to the principle of solitary confinement. Another factor that put a strain on the relations between the Fellowship and the Department was that from the middle of the nineteenth century, at the same time that solitary confinement was introduced, the Central Government wanted to centralize the control of the prison system. The independence of the prison boards and the Fellowships’ role in the prison system were reduced. By introducing experiments with solitary confinement, the Department of Justice had shown its interest in realizing other penitentiary aims than retaliation, aims that would also benefit from education, which was increasingly considered the State’s duty. The Fellowship initially welcomed the Department’s readiness to let the State bear the considerable costs of education, although it had great difficulty in giving up control of penitentiary policy. For the Fellowship all that remained, apart from keeping an eye on Governmental policy, was the care of the prisoners after their discharge. In the second chapter an outline is sketched of the social, political and penal changes that took place around the turn of the century, between 1886 and 1910. It was a transitional period in several ways. At this time a fundamental change took place in the governments’ relationship to the Rehabilitation. Three factors were instrumental to this change. Firstly, opinions were changing as to the extent of the role of Central Government. Due to socio-economic changes, Central Government had to intervene more firmly in the social sphere while political shifts that emerged out of the electoral reform led the Government into an unusual relationship with private initiative. The Government confined itself to imposing general rules while most of the actual work was left to private organisations. Almost at the same time both the objectives and the means of the Penal Code were about to change. Solitary confinement had proved to be an ineffective answer to recidivism. Gradually the Penal Code began to reflect a new vision of punishment, which replaced the ’classic’ nineteenth century point of view. Thus, the position of the Rehabilitation in relation to criminal jurisdiction changed. The task of Rehabilitation was now better adjusted to the Government’s requirements. Both the Government and the Fellowship acknowledged that the Rehabilitation could play a meaningful role in the reduction of recidivism. Finally, a shift in the means and methods of the Fellowship became apparent. After a period in which it had no other choice than trying to influence the Government’s policy, a return to practical action occurred from the middle of the 1880 s onwards. The revival of activities that took place around the turn of the century increased expenses. The Fellowships’ agricultural colony and the maintenance of a Central Office for Information and Employment could hardly be supported from its own financial means. The Department of Justice was willing to provide some financial back-up, by which it also gave a sign of its’ approval of the Rehabilitation work. In spite of the objections that existed within the Fellowship against the Rehabilitation Regulations, an agreement was reached with the Department. From this we may conclude that it became apparent that Government involvement in the Rehabilitation would have a benefitial influence on its activities. The fact that the first Rehabilitation Regulations were partly analogous to the Child Protection Acts, also concerning their implementing orders, indicates that their constitutive ideas were similar. In the matter of rehabilitation the Government thus felt a similar need to regulate what was gradually coming to be considered a task of the Administration. The third chapter {{deals with the}} effects of the subsidization of Rehabilitation work, in the period leading up to World War Two. The image of Rehabilitation was drastically changed by the statutory decision to subsidize its activities. The aims of Rehabilitation Regulations of 1910 to further develop the Rehabilitation were partly realised before the Second World War. As a result of the subsidy scheme the opportunities for charitable organizations to play an active role in Rehabilitation increased. However, the State’s intention to involve various private associations in Rehabilitation, brought along its own problems. These problems were increased by the economic situation during the interbellum period. As a considerable number of private associations became involved in Rehabilitation work, the need for a coordinating organisation soon developed. In 1913 the Association of Rehabilitation Societies (the Vereeniging van Reclasserings Instellingen, VvRI) was founded. As a result of denominational segregation, forces were joined in ideological sociopolitical groups. A conglomerate of Catholic and Protestant charitable societies united their activities in, respectively, the Roman Catholic Rehabilitation Society (the RKRV, 1917) and the Protestant Rehabilitation Society (the PCRV, 1929). Owing to the denominational organizations’ claims to autonomy, the extent of the VvRI’s mandate remained severely restricted, so that its’ importance as a coordinating body particularly in relation to the Government remained small. As a result of the economic crisis, the organisational structure of the Rehabilitation became subject to criticism. The desparate financial situation confronted Rehabilitation with the high costs of ideological differentiation. The call for a more efficient organisation was increasing. The Fellowship in particular had tried hard to prevent the denominational segregation of the Rehabilitation and had often campaigned for a more efficient organisational structure. In secret consultations between the leaders of the segregated organisations, and the Fellowship, a new organisational structure was set up to overcome the disadvantages of ideological segregation on a district level by means of more powerful rehabilitation councils. The statutory status that the councils recieved in the 1947 Rehabilitation Regulations, was a legacy from the period of occupation that, nonetheless suited the post-war conception of the role of the Government in society. The basis of the post-war organisation of the Rehabilitation was nevertheless founded in the 1930 s. In those years, A more authoritative Governmental regulation was proposed that fell in line with a general wish for the Government to take vigorous action during the time of crisis. The integration of rehabilitation into criminal jurisdiction characterized the period between 1910 and 1945. Despite denominational segregation, it was clear that the Government tried to expand its influence on private rehabilitation organisations in several ways. These efforts were understandable, since the involvement of the Rehabilitation in criminal jurisdiction had increased after the introduction of the possibility of sentence on probation, and the increased possibility of release on parole in 1915. With the introduction of pre-sentence reports made by the Rehabilitation organisations for the information of the court, the Rehabilitation was given a useful instrument with which it could increase its influence at several stages of a criminal procedure. The integration of the Rehabilitation within criminal jurisdiction developed successfully, in accordance to the wishes of both the Rehabilitation and the Government. Chapter four centres around the reorganisation and further development of the Rehabilitation after the Second World War. During the period between 1945 and 1968 two stages can be distinguished in the relationship between the Department and the Rehabilitation. Directly after the war, the Government played a leading role. In collaboration with various organisations the Department tried to improve the quality of the rehabilitation by stimulating expansion and professionalization. Throughout the reconstruction period, a consensus prevailed between the Department and the organisations. As a result of the Rehabilitation Regulations of 1947, the Rehabilitation became subject to unprecedented enlargement and professionalization. The ties between the Government and the private initiatives were strengthened. The first ten years after the Rehabilitation Regulations of 1947, were characterized by the deployment of officials in guidance and after-care. Gradually, the voluntary workers disappeared from the picture, while a change took place in the decision-making capacities of the managers and the implementing personnel. The workers acquired greater authority. The organisations strove for expansion by reducing the number of divisions. The Department stimulated the influx of paid workers, the promotion of expertise, and the scaling up of the rehabilitation work. The organisations accepted the Government’s authority, whether directly or via the public rehabilitation councils. In the following period, starting at the end of the fifties when the professional development had reached its peak, the Rehabilitation gradually began to question the authoritative role of the Government. From that moment on, the relationship between the Department and the private rehabilitation organisations came under increasing pressure. The professional development was a necessary condition for the discussion about the position of the Rehabilitation in relation to criminal jurisdiction and the Department. This discussion had three major aspects. Firstly, new ideas about rehabilitation work developed. Social workers aimed at operating as much as possible according to their own professional insight. In short, they needed a relationship with their clients that was based upon trust, which was difficult to combine with the judicial tasks of the rehabilitation organisations. As a result, a re-evaluation became nescessary to consider the position of rehabilitation work within the whole of criminal jurisdiction. Another point of vital importance was that the initial individual-psychological orientation of the social scientists was exchanged for a more sociological perspective, whereby society itself becomes subject to critical analysis. As a result, the aims of the rehabilitation work were extended beyond the more confined goals of the Department. The Department endeavoured to keep the expansion within reasonable limits. Secondly, the changing of society as a whole had repercussions on the Rehabilitation. The fact that probation officers were educated at colleges for social work contributed to the Rehabilitation’s receptiveness to the ideals of the sixties, bringing with it a critical attitude towards authoritative institutions. This led to the need for professional autonomy, at a time when the initial arguments in favour of the private character of the Rehabilitation had lost their validity. The private character of the Rehabilitation had to be redefined, now that the idea of the ’sovereignty of private circles’ was finally abandoned for a more professional attitude towards the task of Rehabilitation. Besides the three conditional aspects of the professional development, a high workload and a deteriorating relationship between informative and <b>after-care</b> <b>services,</b> served as concrete starting points for debate. Chapter five examines the impulses that led to a fusion of the Rehabilitation organisations. I describe the short, but eventful period between 1968 and 1976 as a phase in which a definite swing from an ideologically inspired rehabilitation towards a professional service took place. The new orientation of the Rehabilitation was consolidated along with numerous discussions. Guidance to discharged prisoners, and servitude to criminal jurisdiction were progressively looked upon as mutually exclusive categories. Because the guidance of the justitiable came first, a polarised relationship with criminal jurisdiction was created. The ’professional revolution’ also had its influence on the relationship between the Department and the private rehabilitation organisations. Between 1965 and 1969 it seemed that the Department gave in to the organisations, at least as far as having to acknowledge their professional identity is concerned. The opposition of the organisations to the Governmental interference dating from the end of the fifties, finally bore fruit. This can be seen in the Rehabilitation Regulations of 1970. The rehabilitation councils lost their guiding and controlling position; the responsibility of the organisations to public councils was exchanged for a system of internal communications. Because no new administrative system took its’ place, the Department gradually assumed a non-directive attitude towards the organisations. The end of the chapter five shows how the professional basis of the Rehabilitation again led to the scaling up of the rehabilitation organisation. The Departments’ call for closer cooperation and efficiency in 1968, was interpreted by the implementing workers as an encouragement towards fusion. The probation officers who were at the basis of the organisation deliberately acted as catalysts for this process. By pressing for a fusion they brought about the supremacy of the professional over the ideological attitude towards the rehabilitation work. At the time of the formulation of the objectives of the General Rehabilitation Society (the Algemene Reclasseringsvereniging, ARV), the most that the founders could achieve was a compromise between the rendering of services to Criminal Justice and support to the justitiable. Given the internal disagreements over the objectives of Rehabilitation it would not have been wise to include an explicit stand in the statutes. Within the Rehabilitation a new approach was sought from which the foundations of the work and the relationship with the Government had to be redefined. By 1976, when the ARV was founded, this reverification was nowhere near completion. The period discussed in chapter six covers 1976 to 1982, when the attitude of the Department changed again. Although it refrained from interfering in the implementation, its interest in planning and management was increased. The discussion around the position of the Rehabilitation with regard to criminal jurisdiction exercised the minds of many, even after the fusion. The Rehabilitation looked upon itself as a welfare organisation, operating on jurisdictional grounds. Instead of attempting to decrease the tension that was thus created, it elevated this point of view to its field of activity. The Rehabilitation wished to express its public welfare values at a certain distance from criminal jurisdiction. Initially, the Department did not participate in the discussion about the Rehabilitation’s identity. However, during the late seventies it was the Department of Justice that accelerated the discussion. At the same time that the ARV completed its internal structure, a jurisdictional change of climate took place which left its marks on the Rehabilitation’s tasks. An increase in criminality caused a capacity problem within the Penitential system. The Rehabilitation was responsible, in part, for the solution. The Department wanted the Rehabilitation to be clear about its readiness to be involved in experiments with alternative sanctions. Not only were the Rehabilitation’s job responsibilities expanded for the first time since 1915, its attitude towards criminal jurisdiction also changed. As a result the idea gained ground that neither Criminal Law nor guidance were capable of providing an adequate answer to the increase in criminality. By acknowledging the relative value of both guidance and Penal Law, the tension that was raised after the discussion on aims, finally seemed to diminish in the early eighties. This was the first step towards solving the discrepancy between ’punishment’ and ’care’ that had grown within the Rehabilitation. Another important aspect of the period between 1976 and 1982 was the recurring division between decision-making and implementation within the Rehabilitation, which was supposed to be settled partly through the foundation of the ARV. There was an increasing inclination to include policy-making within the work structure in such a way that the top of the working organisation could set up the outlines, while the regional organisations would be free to fill in their alloted policy-making space. Finally, it was important that a turning point was reached in the policy of the Department of Justice towards the Rehabilitation. After a decade of ’unprecedented freedom’, the Rehabilitation was confronted with a Department that showed an increasing interest in policy-making. The Department tried to guide the management of the Rehabilitation according to its own wishes. In this respect the non-directive attitude of the Department came to an end in the last quarter of the 1970 s, even so it remained unwilling to trouble itself with the implementation. In the final chapter, I handle the period between 1982 and 1995. The reorganisation carried out between 1983 and 1986 was not so much a break with the previous developments, more an acceleration of them, partly dictated by the cutbacks considered nescessary. Natural developments were thus speeded up considerably, and sometimes even forced. Coupling the Rehabilitation’s restructuring with severe cutbacks made the process hard to stomach, particularly since, under financial pressure, redefining the relation between Government and private initiative took place at high speed and left little room for compromise. Here I also try to indicate that reducing the cost of Rehabilitation was not the only role-playing factor. In the period refered to, the Government was reviewing the scope of its tasks. The size of the Governmental apparatus and the way government should operate in society, were under debate. For the Rehabilitation this meant that the Department of Justice took control of rehabilitation policy. One example of the pressurised alteration of the Rehabilitation’s objectives was that service rendering ceased to be the primary aim of operational principle. Initially, this worsened the relationship between Government and Rehabilitation. The Ministerially required adjustment of the Rehabilitation’s aims brought up sentiments that were rooted in the discussion about the Rehabilitation’s identity. In this respect the reorganisation also marked the end of a period, now that in the early eighties the discussion about the Rehabilitation’s identity finally appeared to be settled. The improved relations between the Government and the Rehabilitation were in my opinion at least partly due to changes in the Penal Code, which made the implementation of criminal jurisdiction much more accessible to the Rehabilitation’s activities. The Dutch Federation of Rehabilitation Agencies (Nederlandse Federatie van Reclasseringsinstellingen, NFR), founded in 1986, served as an intermediary between the Department and nineteen autonomous Rehabilitation Foundations. This brought along a new problem because, particularly the larger organisations were not prepared to give up part of their autonomy to a coordinating organisation. In 1992, the disfunctioning of the NFR led to the latest reorganisation, eliminating the inadequacies of the rehabilitation organisation and clarifying the relation between the Government and the Rehabilitation. ...|$|E
