5|$|In {{response}} to increasing pressure from Navy leaders, Long created a permanent advisory staff after the war. The board, created in March 1900, {{was designed to}} unify {{the work of the}} Office of Naval Intelligence, the Naval War College, and the fleet leadership for the production of war plans <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> preparation, planning, and deployment of naval resources in pursuit of objectives defined in those plans. After the war, Long pushed forward plans to establish a naval base in the Philippines, however, the funding for plans was held up in Congress, which repeatedly sought review of potential base locations in the islands. The matter was also caught up in branch rivalry with the War Department, which objected to the Navy's establishment of a permanent base there that was not under its authority. Construction of the Subic Bay Naval Base did not begin until after Long left office.|$|E

5|$|Local {{units are}} called {{squadron}}s. A squadron is broken into flights. Squadrons {{are the main}} functioning body of Civil Air Patrol. Civil Air Patrol squadrons are designated as either cadet, senior, or composite squadrons. A CAP composite squadron consists of both cadets and senior members, who {{may be involved in}} any of the three missions of Civil Air Patrol. Composite squadrons have two deputy commanders to assist the squadron commander: a Deputy Commander for Seniors and a Deputy Commander for Cadets. A senior squadron includes only senior members, who participate in the emergency services or aerospace education missions of Civil Air Patrol. A cadet squadron is largely made up of cadets, with a small number of senior members as necessary for supervision of cadets <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> execution of the cadet program. Overseas squadrons operate independently of this structure, reporting directly to the National Headquarters.|$|E

25|$|In mathematics, {{the concept}} of {{symmetry}} is studied {{with the notion of}} a mathematical group. Every polyhedron has an associated symmetry group, which is the set of all transformations (Euclidean isometries) which leave the polyhedron invariant. The order of the symmetry group is the number of symmetries of the polyhedron. One often distinguishes between the full symmetry group, which includes reflections, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> symmetry group, which includes only rotations.|$|E

The machines also comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, through use of Braille and a headset jack: audible commands for each menu item are provided once a headset is connected <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> sequence is keyed through the keypad; all non-visual commands are then entered via the keypad instead of the touchscreen.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the mineral}} classes {{detected}} may have formed in environments suitable (i.e., enough water <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> pH) for life. The mineral smectite (a phyllosilicate) forms in near-neutral waters. Phyllosilicates and carbonates {{are good for}} preserving organic matter, so they may contain evidence of past life. Sulfate deposits preserve chemical and morphological fossils, and fossils of microorganisms form in iron oxides like hematite. The presence of opaline silica points toward a hydrothermal environment that could support life. Silica is also excellent for preserving evidence of microbes.|$|E

25|$|Sanitation is the {{prevention}} of human contact with feces <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> treatment and disposal of wastewater. Sanitation also includes promoting hygiene {{on a personal level}} through washing hands with soap. Proper sanitation protects people from hazards that may be microbiological, biological or chemical agents of disease. The main objective of a sanitation system is to protect and promote human health by providing a clean environment that will break the cycle of disease. For example, improving access to safe sanitation and changing hygiene behaviours can reduce the incidents of diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|For {{all persons}} except {{the third person}} singular, the present tense is formed by the {{insertion}} of -i, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> enclitic pronominal ending: girin, girim, girir. As with the infinitive, -i causes an a or o in the stem to umlaut to e: pedin, pedim, pedir, from pad-. The third person singular, {{because it has a}} zero-ending, does not require the insertion of -i. This leaves the bare stem, which, because of Sindarin's phonological history, causes the vowel of the stem to become long: gîr, blâb, pâd.|$|E

The woman is instructed about {{the purposes of the}} breast reduction surgery, the achievable corrections, the expected final size, shape, and contour of the reduced breasts, the expected final appearance of the breast reduction scars; possible changes in the sensation of the nipple-areola complex (NAC), possible changes in her breast-feeding capability, and possible medical complications. The woman also is instructed about post-operative matters such as convalescence <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> care of the surgical wounds to the breasts.|$|E
25|$|Because {{water has}} good {{properties}} as a coolant, water plus antifreeze {{is used in}} internal combustion engines and other heat transfer applications, such as HVAC chillers and solar water heaters. The purpose of antifreeze is to prevent a rigid enclosure from bursting due to expansion when water freezes. Commercially, both the additive (pure concentrate) and the mixture (diluted solution) are called antifreeze, depending on the context. Careful selection of an antifreeze can enable a wide temperature range in which the mixture remains in the liquid phase, which is critical to efficient heat transfer <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> functioning of heat exchangers.|$|E
25|$|In poetry, {{the early}} 18th century was {{an age of}} satire and public verse, and in prose, it was an age of the {{developing}} novel. In drama, by contrast, it was an age in transition between the highly witty and sexually playful Restoration comedy, the pathetic she-tragedy of {{the turn of the}} 18th century, and any later plots of middle-class anxiety. The Augustan stage retreated from the Restoration's focus on cuckoldry, marriage for fortune, and a life of leisure. Instead, Augustan drama reflected questions the mercantile class had about itself and {{what it meant to be}} gentry: what it meant to be a good merchant, how to achieve wealth with morality, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> role of those who serve.|$|E

Three ways CI goes about solving nature-related problems are: 1) identifying and moving to protect locations that are crucial, such as those affecting water, food, and air; 2) working with large companies {{that are involved in}} energy and agriculture, to ensure the environment is being protected; and 3) working with governments to ensure they have the knowledge <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> tools to construct policies that are environmentally friendly.|$|E
25|$|Tobacco {{production}} {{requires the}} use of large amounts of pesticides. Tobacco companies recommend up to 16 separate applications of pesticides just in the period between planting the seeds in greenhouses and transplanting the young plants to the field. Pesticide use has been worsened by the desire to produce larger crops in less time because of the decreasing market value of tobacco. Pesticides often harm tobacco farmers because they are unaware of the health effects <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> safety protocol for working with pesticides. These pesticides, as well as fertilizers, end up in the soil, waterways, and the food chain. Coupled with child labor, pesticides pose an even greater threat. Early exposure to pesticides may increase a child's lifelong cancer risk, as well as harm his or her nervous and immune systems.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} {{building}} programme that also cleared the inner city slums, from the 1950s onwards, historic Georgian Dublin came under concerted attack by the Irish Government's development policies. Whole swathes of 18th-century houses were demolished, notably in Fitzwilliam Street and St Stephen's Green, to make way for utilitarian office blocks and government departments. Much of this development was fuelled by property developers and speculators keen {{to cash in on the}} buoyant property markets of the 1960s, late 1970s and 1980s. Many schemes were built by Government supporters with the intention of profitably letting to highly desirable State tenants such as government departments and State agencies. It has been proven that many buildings were approved by government ministers personally connected with the developers involved, often to the detriment of the taxpayer <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> planning and preservation of Dublin city.|$|E
