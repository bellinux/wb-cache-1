50|$|Joe Dante was {{originally}} attached {{to direct a}} Phantom film for Paramount Pictures in the early 1990s, and he developed {{a draft of the}} script together with Jeffrey Boam.

According to Dante:I developed the script with the late Jeff Boam, who wrote Innerspace, as a kind of a spoof. We were a few weeks away from shooting in Australia when the plug was pulled over the budget and the presence of a winged demon at the climax. A year or so later it was put back into production - sans demon - only nobody seemed to notice it was written to be funny, so it was - disastrously - played straight.
