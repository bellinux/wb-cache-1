2500|$|Quoting William Placher, Domestication of Transcendence, Louisville, 1996, (p.66) : [...] "In {{the famous}} extra-Calvinisticum, Calvin insisted, against Luther, that {{something}} of God's infinity remained uncaptureable in God's finite self-revelation in Jesus Christ...this does not imply, I think, {{that what we}} know of God is false, but only that, while true <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes,</b> it is necessarily limited to our finite capacities. Calvin's real concern here {{seems to have been}} to preserve the reality of the Incarnation, which appeared to him threatened by a view in which even Christ's humanity took on divine infinity and thereby ceased to be really human."

2500|$|After the {{screening}} of the film at the Cannes Film Festival, Redford received a standing ovation. Writing for The Independent, Geoffrey Macnab said the film was [...] "utterly compelling viewing". Andrew Pulver, writing for The Guardian, said that [...] "Redford delivers {{a tour de force}} performance: holding the screen effortlessly with no acting support whatsoever." [...] Justin Chang of Variety said of Redford's performance that he [...] "holds the viewer’s attention merely by wincing, scowling, troubleshooting and yelling the occasional expletive". Robbie Collin of The Telegraph said, [...] "The film's scope is limited, but <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes,</b> All Is Lost is very good indeed: a neat idea, very nimbly executed." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{is ironic}} that an {{acclaimed}} biblical novel, one that would rival the Bible in popularity during the Gilded Age, {{was inspired by a}} discussion with a noted agnostic and written by an author who was never a member of any church. Its publication prompted speculation about Wallace’s faith. Wallace claimed that when he began writing Ben-Hur, he was not [...] "in the least influenced by religious sentiment" [...] and [...] "had no convictions about God or Christ", but he was fascinated by the biblical story of the three Magi's journey to find Jesus, king of the Jews. After extensive studies of the Bible and the Holy Land, and well before he had completed the novel, Wallace became a believer in God and Christ. In his autobiography Wallace acknowledged:In the very beginning, before distractions overtake me, I wish to say that I believe absolutely in the Christian conception of God. <b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes,</b> this confession is broad and unqualified, and it ought and would be sufficient were it not that books of mine—Ben-Hur and The Prince of India—have led many persons to speculate concerning my creed ... I am not a member of any church or denomination, nor have I ever been. Not that churches are objectionable to me, but simply because my freedom is enjoyable, and I do not think myself good enough to be a communicant.|$|E
