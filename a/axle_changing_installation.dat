This included decreasing weight by approx. 8 t., levelling weight on all <b>axles,</b> <b>changing</b> {{air intake system}} and crew cabin as well as installing electric carriage heating system.First locomotives were introduced into Warsaw-Katowice-Gliwice line. As the number of engines was increasing they started serving on all electrified lines in Poland.

40|$|AUDIO ACCOMPANIMENT {{accompanied}} the John Cage exhibition, Every Day is a Good Day, April-June 2011. Many {{thousands of people}} visited the installation, which was featured on the DLWP website. The gallery also organized a Vimeo broadcast of an interview with Hooker concerning the work. The project overall featured contributions from researchers based at the universities of Brighton and Reading. Postgraduate students from University of Brighton were also invited {{to contribute to a}} supporting exhibition. AUDIO ACCOMPANIMENT features a MIDI-controlled grand ‘Clavinova’ grand piano, which is triggered ‘live’ by cosmic ray particles to play a never-ending sequence of notes. The keys of the MIDI-controlled piano move in a ghostly, magical way to produce sound each time a radioactive ‘stardust’ particle hits the Geiger counter, MIDI controller and laptop that are all connected to the piano via its USB input. The piano was sponsored by Yamah UK and involved direct negotiations and modifications between Hooker, the DLWP and Yamaha. Cosmic ray particles pass through each square metre of the earth approximately every 3 seconds, so that the MIDI/Geiger counter-controlled sequence sets up an on-going series of random notes and harmonies, creating silences, then flurries of activity in a mysterious and intriguing way. The particle activity is thought by scientists {{to have an impact on}} our current weather patterns and the work was developed in collaboration with meteorologists from the University of Reading to help them explain this process through an accompanying text.

According to the examined scenarios, soil evaporation decreases at increasing drip lateral depth, while the associated WUE tends to increase when the depth of the lateral rises from 0 to 20 cm.

In order to choose the best position of the lateral, the results of different simulation runs, carried out by <b>changing</b> the <b>installation</b> depth of the lateral (5 cm, 15 cm and 45 cm) were compared in terms of ratio between actual transpiration and total amount of water provided during the entire growing season (WUE).

In the two plots, plants were spaced 0. 40 m along the row and 1. 2 m between the rows. Each plot was irrigated by means of laterals with coextruded emitters spaced 0. 40 m and discharging a flow rate equal to 4. 0 l h- 1 at a nominal pressure of 100 kPa. In each plot, spatial and temporal variability of SWCs were acquired with a Time Domain Reflectometry probe (Trime-FM 3), on a total of four 70 cm long access tubes, installed along the direction perpendicular to the plant row, at distances of 0, 20, 40 and 60 cm from the emitter.

40|$|Goossen, Keith W. The {{approach}} {{proposed in}} this paper relates {{to the concept of}} solar cell cooling. By tilting the solar cell at an angle to the sun, the heating of the solar cell decreases due to reduced solar irradiance, while the cooling of the solar cell by thermal radiation and convection remains the same, and thus the solar cell will be cooler and more efficient. Of course, with such a tilted deployment, more solar cells have to be used for the same deployment area. Thus, this thesis concerns itself with how to gain the maximum energy from certain amount of deployment area by optimizing the geometry of the PV <b>installation.</b> <b>Changing</b> the incident light angle could possibly increase the electricity created by a certain area of incident light but will increase the number of solar cells required. Crystalline silicon solar cell price has fallen dramatically in the past decades and at the same time, the one-time installation fee of a PV system remains very high. Therefore, as the solar panel price becomes minimal compared to the installation cost, and as most households have limited space for solar installation, it is worth looking into the solar cells deployment that result in the largest electricity generation from a fixed size area used for solar cells placement during one installation. The behavior of solar cells at different tilt angles between the incident light has been theoretically and experimentally studied. Experimental results and simulations suggested a power output gain of at most 3 % can be achieved by deploying the solar cell at a certain angle away from sun light for the modules tested under normal weather condition. In summary, this project has explored an alternative passive cooling method that could possibly increase the PV power output from a fixed area of solar panels placed on a limited space, but is proved to be not very practical.
