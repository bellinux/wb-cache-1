40|$|The {{impact damage}} {{resistance}} of laminated composite transport aircraft fuselage structures was studied experimentally. A statistically based designed experiment {{was used to}} examine numerous material, laminate, structural, and extrinsic (e. g., impactor type) variables. The relative importance and quantitative measure of the effect of each variable and variable interactions on responses including impactor dynamic response, visibility, and internal damage state were determined. The study utilized 32 three-stiffener panels, each with a unique combination of material type, material forms, and structural geometry. Two manufacturing techniques, tow placement and tape lamination, were used to build panels representative of potential fuselage crown, keel, and lower side-panel designs. Various combinations of impactor variables representing various foreign-object-impact threats to the aircraft were examined. Impacts performed at different structural locations within each panel (e. g., skin midbay, stiffener <b>attaching</b> <b>flange,</b> etc.) were considered separate parallel experiments. The relationship between input variables, measured damage states, and structural response to this damage are presented including recommendations for materials and impact test methods for fuselage structure...|$|E

40|$|A {{model and}} {{solution}} method {{for determining the}} normal and shear stresses in the interface between the skin and the stiffener <b>attached</b> <b>flange</b> were developed.

These stresses include the normal stress, and the shear stresses in both the longitudinal and the transverse directions. The tendency toward skin/stiffener separation may therefore be minimized by choosing appropriate values for the design variables.

40|$|New skin alloys {{are being}} {{developed}} that are both damage tolerant and strong in compression. At the same time, stiffener alloys are still getting stronger. Stiffened panel designs need to be optimized in new ways to fully benefit from these new material properties. FEA has shown that, provided the joint between skin and stiffeners is good and stringers are strong enough, the overall efficiency of a stiffened panel with large <b>attach</b> <b>flanges</b> is {{greater than that of}} a panel which has very high quadratic section moment. Stringer pitches can thus be kept at economic levels while panel buckling performance is increased by the use of new higher strength, high damage tolerance skin and the next generation of high strength stiffeners. The tangent modulus curves of the new materials mentioned are generally steeper than those of current materials. The present analyses have demonstrated that because the strain in a post-buckled stiffened panel is far from uniform, this does not present any particular risks with respect to sudden loss of stiffness of the panel...|$|R

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is desired}} {{that will allow}} a designer to select appropriate amounts of through-thickness reinforcement needed to meet design requirements. The goal {{is to use a}} relatively simple analysis to minimize the amount of testing that needs to be performed, and to make test results from simple configurations applicable to more general structures. Using this methodology one should be able to optimize the selection of stitching materials, the weight of the yarn, and the stitching density. The analysis approach is to treat substructure disbond as a crack propagation problem. In this approach, the stitches have little influence until a delamination begins to grow. Once the delamination reaches, or extends beyond a stitch, the stitch serves to reduce the strain-energy-release-rate (G) at the crack tip for a given applied load. The reduced G can then be compared to the unstitched materials toughness to predict the load required to further extend the crack. The current model treats the stitch as a simple spring which responds to displacements in the vertical (through-thickness) direction. In concept, this approach is similar to that proposed by other authors. Test results indicate that the model should be refined to include the shearing stiffness of the stitch. The strain-energy-release-rate calculations are performed using a code which uses interconnected higher-order plates to model built-up composite cross-sections. When plates are stacked vertically, the interfacial tractions between the plates can be computed. The plate differential equations are solved in closed-form. The code, called SUBLAM, was developed as part of this section in one dimension. Because of this limitation, rows of stitches are treated as a two-dimensional sheet. The spring stiffness of a row of stitches can be estimated from the stitch material, weight, and density. As a practical and conservative approach, we can assume that the stitch is bonded until a crack passes the stitch location. After the crack passes, it is fully bonded. A series of tests were performed to exercise this methodology and incorporated an <b>attached</b> <b>flange</b> such that the sudden change in thickness initiated a delamination. The analysis was used to estimate the materials' critical G from that of the unstitched specimens. With this data, a prediction was made for the load required to delaminate the stitched specimens. Using the methodology, design charts have been created for simplified geometries. These charts give stitch force, along with G(sub 1) and G(sub 2) as as function of the stitch spring stiffness. Using the charts, {{it should be possible to}} determine the stitch spring stiffness and strength required to reduce the G to a desired level. From these parameters, the actual stitching material, weight, and density can be computed...|$|R

40|$|Some of the Iowa Department of Transportation (Iowa DOT) continuous, steel, welded {{plate girder}} bridges have {{developed}} web cracking in the negative moment regions at the diaphragm connection plates. The cracks are due to out-of-plane bending of the web near the top flange of the girder. The out-of-plane bending occurs in the "web-gap", which is {{the portion of the}} girder web between (1) the top of the fillet welds attaching the diaphragm connection plate to the web and (2) the fillet welds <b>attaching</b> the <b>flange</b> to the web. A literature search indicated that four retrofit techniques have been suggested by other researchers to prevent or control this type of cracking. To eliminate the problem in new bridges, AASHTO specifications require a positive attachment between the connection plate and the top (tension) flange. Applying this requirement to existing bridges is expensive and difficult. The Iowa DOT has relied primarily on the hole-drilling technique to prevent crack extension once cracking has occurred; however, the literature indicates that hole-drilling alone may not be entirely effective in preventing crack extension. The objective of this research was to investigate experimentally a method proposed by the Iowa DOT to prevent cracking at the diaphragm/plate girder connection in steel bridges with X-type or K-type diaphragms. The method consists of loosening the bolts at some connections between the diaphragm diagonals and the connection plates. The investigation included selecting and testing five bridges: three with X-type diaphragms and two with K-type diaphragms. During 1996 and 1997, these bridges were instrumented using strain gages and displacement transducers to obtain the response at various locations before and after implementing the method. Bridges were subjected to loaded test trucks traveling in different lanes with speeds varying from crawl speed to 65 mph (104 km/h) to determine the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results of the study show that the effect of out-of-plane loading was confined to widths of approximately 4 in. (100 mm) {{on either side of the}} connection plates. Further, they demonstrate that the stresses in gaps with drilled holes were higher than those in gaps without cracks, implying that the drilling hole technique is not sufficient to prevent crack extension. The behavior of the web gaps in X-type diaphragm bridges was greatly enhanced by the proposed method as the stress range and out-of-plane distortion were reduced by at least 42 % at the exterior girders. For bridges with K-type diaphragms, a similar trend was obtained. However, the stress range increased in one of the web gaps after implementing the proposed method. Other design aspects (wind, stability of compression flange, and lateral distribution of loads) must be considered when deciding whether to adopt the proposed method. Considering the results of this investigation, the proposed method can be implemented for X-type diaphragm bridges. Further research is recommended for K-type diaphragm bridges...|$|R

The 96 (32 per cryostat) multilayer, G 10, signal boards map the signals from the detector to the preamplifiers, while 'feeding them through' the boundary wall between the argon cryostat and the atmosphere. The feedthrough function is accomplished by <b>attaching</b> a hermetic <b>flange</b> to the signal board, and then sealing the flange to an opening in a stainless steel 'signal box', an extension of the cryostat, with a bolted sea. The geometry is arranged to stratify the gas temperature in a 'tower' (port) to keep the box assemblies, nominally, at room temperature. The cryostat design must obey a set of physical constraints that, effectively, require that the circular cross-section be inscribed in a square. All warm 'access ports' are constrained to reside in the upper quadrants; defined as above the equator, outside the circular cross-section, and inside the square.

40|$|Within the European space programme, a new {{upper stage}} engine (Vinci) for the Ariane 5 {{launcher}} is being developed, and the Volvo Aero Corporation (VAC) is contributing with tur-bines for the fuel turbopumps. This MSc thesis investigates {{the possibility of}} designing the Turbine Exhaust Duct (TED) of the Vinci-engine in a carbon fibre composite material with adhesively <b>attached</b> titanium <b>flanges.</b> The focus of the project has been on stress analyses of the adhesive joints using Finite Element Methods (FEM), more specifically by using a cohe-sive zone material (CZM) to model the adhesive layer. Analysing adhesive joints is complex and {{an important part of}} the work has been to develop and concretise analysis methods for future use within VAC. To obtain the specialised material parameters needed for a CZM analysis, FE-models of ten-sile test specimens were analysed and the results compared to those of equivalent experimen-tal tensile tests. These parameters were then used when analysing the TED geometry with load cases specified to simulate the actual operation conditions of the Vinci engine. Both two-dimensional axisymmetric and fully three-dimensional models were analysed and, addition-ally, a study was performed to evaluate the effect of cryogenic temperatures on the strength of the joint. The results show that the applied thermal and structural loading causes local stress concentra-tions on the adhesive surface, but the stresses are not high enough to cause damage to the joint if a suitable joint design is used. Cryogenic temperatures (- 150 °C) caused a significant strength reduction in the tensile specimens, partially through altered adhesive properties, but no such severe effects were seen in the temperature-dependent FE-analyses of the TED. It should be pointed out however, that some uncertainties about the material parameters exist, since these were obtained in a rather unconventional way. There are also several other impor-tant questions, beside the strength of the adhesive joint, that need to be answered before a metal-composite TED can be realised.

Fokus har legat på att analysera hållfastheten i de limfogar som är tänkta att sammanfoga huvudröret med flänsarna, genom analyser med finita elementmetoden (FEM). Ett viktigt syfte har även varit att, för Volvo Aeros räkning, samla praktiska erfarenheter angående numerisk analys av limfogar, särskilt med användning av kohesiva zon-element för att modellera limfogen. FEM-analyser har gjorts av provstavsmodeller, där resultaten sedan jämförts med experimen-tella dragprovsresultat för att ta fram lämpliga material- och modelleringsparametrar för ana-lys med kohesiva zonelement. Därefter tillämpades dessa parametrar i analyser av den verkli-ga TED-geometrin med relevanta lastfall framtagna för att simulera driftsförhållandena i Vin-ci-motorn. Lastfallsanalyser med både tvådimensionellt axisymmetriska och tredimensionella geometrimodeller genomfördes, liksom uppskattningar av limfogens styrka vid kryogena driftstemperaturer. Resultaten pekar entydigt mot att en limfog med en ändamålsenlig tvärsnittsgeometri skulle hålla för de angivna lasterna utan att ta skada. De spänningskoncentrationer som uppstår ger lokalt höga spänningar i limmet, men inte på nivåer som skulle kunna orsaka brott. Det finns dock en viss osäkerhet angående riktigheten i materialparametrarna då en något okonventio-nell metod användes för att ta fram dessa. Flera stora frågor finns fortfarande kvar att besvara innan en metall-komposit konstruktion kan realiseras, inte minst hur flödeskammarens kom-plicerade geometri skall kunna tillverkas i kompositmaterial...|$|R
40|$|On November 5, 2010, Space Shuttle mission STS- 133 was {{scrubbed}} due to {{a hydrogen}} leak at the Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate (GUCP). After the scrub, {{a crack in the}} foam thermal protection system (TPS) was observed on the External Tank (ET) near the interface between the liquid oxygen (LOX) tank and the Intertank. When the damaged foam was removed, two 9 -in. long cracks were found on the feet of Intertank stringer S 7 - 2, and the stringer failure was the cause of the TPS crack. An investigation was conducted to determine the root cause of the cracks, establish a remedy/repair for the stringers, and provide flight rationale for the damaged tank, ET- 137. The Space Transportation System (STS) Super Lightweight ET (SLWT) is comprised of two propellant tanks (an aft liquid hydrogen (LH 2) tank and a forward LOX tank) and an Intertank. The Intertank serves as the structural connection between the two propellant tanks and also functions to receive and distribute all thrust loads from the solid rocket boosters. The Intertank is a stiffened cylinder structure consisting of eight mechanically joined panels (two integrally-stiffened, machined thrust panels to react the booster loads and six stringer-stiffened skin panels). There are one main ring frame, four intermediate ring frames, and forward and aft flange chords that mate to the respective propellant tanks [...] The skin/stringer panels utilize external hat-section stringers that are mechanically attached with rivets along most of their length and with specialty fasteners, such as GP Lockbolts and Hi-Loks, at the forward and aft ends where the stringers <b>attach</b> to the <b>flange</b> chords. During the STS- 133 Intertank stringer crack investigation, cracks were found on a total of five stringers. All of the cracks were at the LOX end, in the feet of the stringers, and near the forward fasteners (GP Lockbolts). Video of tanking for the November 5 launch attempt was used to determine that the TPS failure, and thus the stringer failure, occurred as the LOX liquid level crossed the LOX tank / Intertank interface ring frame. Hence, cryogenically-induced displacements were suspected as a contributing cause of the stringer cracks. To study the behavior of Intertank stringers subjected to similar displacements, static load tests of individual stringers, colloquially known as "single stringer bending tests" were performed. Approximately thirty stringers were tested, many of which were cut from the partially completed Intertank for what would have been ET- 139. In addition to the tests, finite element (FE) analyses of the test configuration were also performed. In this paper, the FE analyses and test-analysis correlation for stringer test S 6 - 8 are presented. Stringer S 6 - 8 is a "short chord" configuration with no doubler panels...|$|R
40|$|In {{torsion-box}} {{design of}} twin girder overhead cranes, the bridge rail {{on which the}} lifting unit runs is positioned eccentrically on the girder, directly above one of the web plates. This web is subjected to in-plane patch loading produced by the spread of a wheel load through the overlying rail and flange. This study concerns the load carrying capacity of plate box-girder web panels subjected to a wheel load at the midspan of the panel. Distribution of a wheel load through a rail and flange is investigated from recordings made of in-plane vertical stress distribution profiles along the upper edge of a web panel of a short-span model box-girder. The girder was loaded through various interfaces above the web by a wheel load. A simple method is proposed for relating a distributed wheel load to an equivalent uniform patch load. Methods for estimating distributed wheel loading lengths are investigated. It is shown that crane web panels are generally subjected to patch loads of short length, occupying less than one-quarter of the panel length. A computer analysis is presented to determine elastic buckling coeffic-ients for flat rectangular plates subjected to a uniform in-plane patch load centrally disposed on one edge and supported by shear stresses on the adjacent edges. Patch loads of various lengths are considered over a range of plate aspect ratios for plates with various combinations of simply supported and clamped edges. Also considered are some non-uniformly distributed patch loads modelling approximately a distributed wheel load. For {{the large majority of}} geometries considered, it is the support condition along the loaded edge which has greatest influence on the buckling load. Correlation with buckling loads estimated from experimental measurements on a model crane girder web panel indicated that an assumption of simply supported panel edges is over-conservative and that it is probably more representative to consider the edges <b>attached</b> to the <b>flanges</b> as clamped. Ultimate load carrying capacity is considered. A plastic mechanism analysis originally presented by Roberts and Rockey is studied and a modified form derived which reveals the transition region from collapse initiated by direct web yielding for girders with stocky webs to failure by a mechanism of out-of-plane web deformation for girders with slender webs. Certain approximations in the original analysis are shown to involve the omission of terms which can contribute significantly to the plastic work expression. Inclusion of these terms, however, whilst offering potential refinement, increases considerably the complexity of the analysis. Results are presented of a series of collapse tests conducted on short-span model box-girders subjected to a wheel load above one of the webs. The effect on the failure load of rail size, web thickness, panel aspect ratio, and longitudinal web stiffening is investigated. Snap buckling was exhibited by several of the test web panels. From the results, a simple expression is developed for predicting collapse loads of plate girders subjected to narrow patch loads. The main findings of the work are used as a basis for a series of recommendations to aid the structural designer in taking account of patch loading on slender web panels...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this report was done in order to design a pressurized test facility for droplet analysis with a laser measurement technique, Phase Doppler Anemometry. The test facility was a development work within Chemrec's pressurized black liquor gasification (BLG) project. BLG is a complex process where black liquor is atomized and sprayed into a reactor and gasified using pure oxygen. In the process {{it is crucial that}} all organic material is consumed to produce combustible gases using three stages of conversion: drying, pyrolysis and char gasification. In the end of the conversion, only an inorganic smelt is supposed to remain (ideally). For the gasification process, {{it is important to be}} fully aware of the spray characteristics created by the nozzle that yields an ideal conversion. Therefore a pressurized spray test facility with optical access windows for measurements was developed. Parameters that are important and interesting to study are droplet size and their velocity. The purpose of the facility is to gain quantitative information to optimize the black liquor gasification (BLG) process. For measuring droplets, a non-intrusive laser measurements system is used called Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA). PDA is the most advantageous technique for measuring droplet velocity and size distribution. The first stage in the work of developing this spray test facility was a brief feasibility study of other pressurized spray testing facilities using PDA, to get information of different concepts. Concepts and configurations of the different parts for the pressurized test facility have been analyzed and investigated with a variety of engineering tools. Because measurements with PDA are very depending on certain receiving angles a deep review of PDA was performed, all to achieve correct placement of the transmitting and receiving optical access windows. The final design resulted in a standing pressure vessel with height 5600 mm and a diameter of 500 mm. The test facility was tested and is approved for a working pressure of 15 bar. To prevent corrosion due to the future application of black liquor atomization, it was made of stainless steel (SS 2343). Four optical access side ports were placed approximately 500 mm from the top of the vessel. The side port for the transmitter probe is located at 0 degrees and the three receiving side ports at 106. 3, 120 and 270 degrees. These angles were chosen to fulfill the requirements and demands essential for PDA. Simulations using CFD have contributed with useful information for the flow behavior inside the vessel and how droplets are affected by it. These simulations gave information about the flow near the optical access side ports and the necessity of optical clearance. The simulations show that recirculated flow carries droplets from the spray that reaches the glass windows, which is not preferable as it may interfere during laser measurements. Initial test runs and experiments confirm the results obtained from the simulations. The outcome of this study became a development of a purging air wall to prevent droplets reaching the glass windows. Fine polished fused quartz glass, especially suitable for laser measurements is used for the glass windows. These glasses are free from inclusions and are distinguished from other glasses by good transmission in UV- and the visible spectral range. A solid mechanic calculation of the glass specimen was performed to determine the thickness of the glass in order to withstand a maximum pressure of 15 bar. An evacuation port was placed in the middle of the vessel to perform evacuation of gas. The evacuation is used for both atmospheric and pressurized conditions. During pressurized runs, a flange lid with a pressure control valve can be attached to this side port to regulate the pressure. Connections for adding a fluid level gauge were placed on the vessel side. On the top of the vessel a unique designed spray lance traversing system were <b>attached</b> on a <b>flange</b> lid. With this arrangement the spray can be rotated and traversed up and down through the top lid. This device enables measurements in a large part of the spray. The test facility has been installed and initial test runs performed. Measuring and optimization of the facility will continue. When optimized, the results of the measurements from this facility will be applied in the BLG project. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
