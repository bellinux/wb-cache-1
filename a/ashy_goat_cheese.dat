5000|$|Laura Chenel is {{a cheese}} maker who was America's first {{commercial}} producer of <b>goat</b> <b>cheese,</b> {{and helped to}} popularize <b>goat</b> <b>cheese</b> in America. In 1979, she began producing chèvre in the Bay Area town of Sebastopol, California, after a fact-finding trip to visit <b>goat</b> <b>cheese</b> producers in France. After several months of working to sell her product to local markets (with mixed success, due to American unfamiliarity with <b>goat</b> <b>cheeses</b> at the time), she received her first major opportunity when Alice Waters of Chez Panisse in Berkeley, California placed a standing order for her cheese in 1980. Waters listed the cheese by name on her menu (as [...] "Laura Chenel's Chèvre", in {{what may have been}} the first American instance of <b>goat</b> <b>cheese</b> salad), which provided Chenel {{with a great deal of}} publicity. Eventually, her operation would grow to sell over two million pounds of cheese per year. The company primarily manufactures fresh chèvre, although aged cheeses make up roughly 10% of its business. In 2006, Chenel sold the company to the Rians Group, a French corporation which has purchased multiple small farming operations, while retaining ownership of her herd of five hundred goats.|$|R
