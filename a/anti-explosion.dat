The aircraft has an empty weight of 262 kg and a gross weight of 450 kg, giving a useful load of 188 kg.|$|E
50|$|The Surion is {{equipped}} with various survivability and damage reduction features. Both the airframe and the cockpit have been made bulletproof against small arms fire. The airframe, tail rotor, and the rotor blades used on both the main and tail rotors are of a crashworthy construction; <b>anti-explosion</b> sealed fuel tanks are also used. The main gearbox is capable of flying for a limited period after suffering the loss of lubricating oil. Various electronic defensive measures are incorporated onto the Surion, such as a countermeasures dispenser system (CMDS), radar warning receiver (RWR), laser warning receiver (LWR).|$|E

Thermo-catalytic combusting technology used in the <b>anti-explosion</b> of fuel-air mixture is viewed as a kind of most promising technology, which can safely dispose the fuel-air mixture. This paper mainly introduces the resistance characteristics of fuel-air mixture within the catalytic combustion bed and the experimental results of the influence of catalytic thickness on resistance of fuel-air mixture. Based on the experiment and analysis, the resistance predicting model using in catalytic combusting bed is putting forward. The conclusions drown from the studies and researches will not only have much important significance for the design and optimization with thermo-catalytic reactor for <b>anti-explosion</b> in oil and natural gas engineering, but also supply some important references to the analysis of the fuel-air mixture flowing in porous media in other fields...|$|E

30|$|Recently, for {{advantages}} of <b>anti-explosion,</b> zero-emission, and pollution-free, sustainable energy vehicles suitable for friendly environments {{have been widely}} adopted as a late model green transport. Main part of sustainable energy vehicles is air-powered engine, and the pneumatic-hydraulic transmission is broadly applied as the main heart of the driving system for great {{advantages of}} simple structure, recyclability, low cost, high storage density of energy and long lifespan [1 – 3]. Though the advantages are obvious, it also owns disadvantages such as low efficiency by insufficient of the energy utilization, which aggravates the waste of energy, especially under the recent environment of energy shortage and developing green movements [4, 5].|$|E
40|$|International audienceTechnological Risk Prevention Planning (PPRT) is a French {{tool for}} {{managing}} land-use planning near upper-tier SEVESO industrial facilities. Its {{purpose is to}} protect the population against industrial hazards. Risk limitation measures may include for example window reinforcement for new or existing blast risk exposed buildings. In order to better define technical guidelines for window reinforcement, INERIS developed an innovative experimental device. INERIS has studied window behaviour and has evaluated blast capacity of different kinds of glass panels (monolithic or insulated glasses with or without <b>anti-explosion</b> film, laminated glasses [...] .), mobile frames or window locking or anchorage systems. Results show that all window components have to be considered to improve safety...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{improve the}} {{economic}} efficiency of gas pipelines, core {{equipment such as}} compressor sets and large-diameter valves must be localized. For this purpose, in alliance with other related enterprises, PetroChina Company Limited established an equipment localization R&D system and a new product testing system and successfully developed a 20  MW class motor-driven compressor set, a 30  MW-class gas turbine-driven compressor unit, and a high-pressure and large-diameter welded ball valve. First, the motor-driven compressor R&D focuses on three main units. The developed frequency-control device structure is a cascaded multilevel with a capacity of 25  MVA. The developed <b>anti-explosion</b> dynamo with a motor speed of 4800  rpm can produce a power of 22  MW. The developed compressor is PCL 800 with features of a high efficiency and a wide flow-operating point-adjustment range. Second, there are two steps of the R&D of a GT-driven compressor unit (product A + product B) : auxiliary supporting systems and control systems are developed for the imported GT 25000 gas turbine, together with China-made compressors, to constitute product A; simultaneously, the R&D of product B of a gas turbine is carried out, which would replace the imported one. Third, aiming {{to solve the problems}} of sealing and welding, we developed the high-pressure and large-diameter all-welded ball valves in full replace of the same kind of imported products with three different sizes: NPS 40 Class 600, NPS 48 Class 600, and NPS 48 Class 900...|$|E
