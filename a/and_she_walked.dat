25|$|In October 1902, Mother Amadeus {{traveled}} to Miles City, Montana, via train. Her east-bound train crashed head-on into a west-bound train. Her hip was broken, and Mother Amadeus spent nine {{weeks in a}} hospital in Helena. The primitive system of weights attached to her ankles (used as traction to keep the hip bones in place) did not work properly, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> with a severe limp and used a cane {{for the rest of}} her life.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 2007, Underwood topped five Billboard Year-End charts, {{including}} Billboard 200 Artist of the Year {{and also}} Country Artist of the Year.

At the 2008 American Music Awards, Carnival Ride won the Favorite Country Album award, thus making that her 2nd consecutive win in such category.|$|E
60|$|So she walked, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked,</b> <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> {{till she}} came to the giant, and prayed him to tell her if he had seen three young men pass that way seeking the distant mountain.|$|E
5000|$|Smokey Stover is {{referenced}} in [...] "Jumbeliah", an unreleased song Bruce Springsteen {{wrote in}} his early career: [...] "Built like Marilyn Monroe, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> just like Smokey Stover." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have such}} a number of apartments. My servant will show them to you." [...] <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> back with great state to her chair by the window, and resumes her station and work there.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly!" [...] said Frank, eagerly. [...] "She {{is quite}} a mother to those poor little wretches; they watch for her at the Sirenwood gate, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> with them. The boy's cry was not for mother or nurse, but for Lena!" ...|$|R
60|$|He looked {{towards her}} marvelling. Her cheeks were prettily flushed, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> with the {{delightful}} springiness of perfect health.|$|E
60|$|He rose {{directly}} afterwards, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> {{with him}} out to the gardens whence a short cut led to the village.|$|E
60|$|A wistful look {{came into}} her face at his words, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> with a {{drooping}} head across the orchard to the bench.|$|E
50|$|In 2009 <b>and</b> 2012, <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> for the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, 2014, 2015, <b>and</b> 2016 <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.|$|R
50|$|The video {{features}} {{a woman in}} a flat being harassed by two men, whom she eventually has leave. Shortly after, a hole in a wall in her flat opens <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> through it <b>and</b> finds herself amoung a crowd of people watching Oasis performing the song.|$|R
60|$|She {{held out}} her hand; in another moment he turned away, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> on to {{the house with a}} strange sense of depression.|$|E
6000|$|... "Excitement {{seems to}} have turned your brain, M. de Marmont," [...] was all that Crystal said, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> {{straight}} past him to the carriage door.|$|E
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> {{away with}} her head {{extremely}} high, having certainly given Master Stebbing a good lesson. Fergus ran after her. 'Gill, Gill, you won't tell.' ...|$|E
50|$|Back in {{the city}} things start to normalise. Michelle is {{promoted}} and buys herself a sports car. The differences in their lives become more apparent. Conor suspects her feelings for him are cooling. After she stands him up they have a furious row. Things are said. Emotions spill over <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> out.|$|R
60|$|Stately and solemn was the {{recognition}} which she accorded to Luke's salutation, <b>and</b> then <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> {{on into the}} house.|$|R
60|$|Joshua laughed, <b>and</b> explained. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> by {{his side}} over the {{concrete}} paving to {{the first of the}} varnished stalls.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you see how}} {{cross it}} makes me?" [...] <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> away, feeling that things were not going as she {{intended}} to have them at all.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! he {{will never}} be able to do that,' thought she; 'it is much more {{difficult}} than the hill.' <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> home slowly, with her head bent.|$|E
6000|$|... 'They are not asleep yet,' muttered {{the witch}} to herself; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> {{up and down}} in the passage, and then came back to the door, and said: ...|$|E
5000|$|The Queen is 17, she is {{of small}} height, slender, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> with a visible limp, {{even though she}} wears high heels shoes to hide her deformity. She is of dark {{complexion}} and is fairly pretty. Her wit is remarkable for her age <b>and</b> once <b>she</b> has set her mind on doing something, she makes sure she succeeds, by all means necessary and at any price.|$|R
5000|$|Richardson {{was known}} for her speed <b>and</b> athleticism; <b>she</b> set {{numerous}} records for speed and endurance, which Ronald Clark notes [...] "discomfited many male climbers". One of her guides commented, [...] "She does not sleep, <b>she</b> doesn't eat <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> like the devil." [...] She was also known for wearing a skirt on all of her expeditions, even when her partner Paillon wore breeches.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{followed}} by Toto <b>and</b> Billina, <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> {{away from the}} high marble wall and started back along the narrow path toward the sign-post.|$|R
6000|$|... "But what is it, Myles?" [...] <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> up to him, {{and put her}} {{two hands}} on his shoulders, and looked up in his face--"what is your strange news?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{door was}} ajar, {{and she could}} not see {{anything}} within. She pushed it open tentatively: there was no sound: Frank was evidently not there, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> boldly in.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> on, {{as proud}} a little woman {{as any in}} Nottingham. And Paul felt he had done {{something}} for her, if only a trifle. All his work was hers.|$|E
6000|$|... "She is {{the most}} {{beautiful}} woman I have ever seen. <b>She</b> is pale <b>and</b> <b>she</b> has strange brown eyes, not really brown but lighter. I couldn't tell you the color for I've never seen anything else like it. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> has real red-brown hair, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> is slim, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> like one of these women one reads about. They say that she is a Comtesse in her own right but that she never uses the title." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "The {{best thing}} he could do," [...] she quietly remarked, [...] "would be to teach the old hens good manners"; <b>and</b> then <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> away with her book.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> {{without her}} hat. In {{a little while}} William recovered, and was rather tender to her. Coming to a bridge, he carved her {{initials}} and his in a heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{must speak}} to you first," [...] said she, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> rapidly towards the orchard. As she still held the papers in her hand, I was obliged to follow her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Guy <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> down {{so often}} after dinner," [...] he said quietly. [...] "I have stood here and watched them. Sometimes she came alone. What {{a long time}} ago that seems!" ...|$|E
60|$|Rollo's father {{thought it}} would be a good plan, <b>and</b> <b>she,</b> accordingly, <b>walked</b> along towards Rollo slowly, {{gathering}} berries as she went.|$|R
50|$|In Dakar, selling {{newspapers}} on {{the street}} is an occupation always occupied by boys. But one morning, Sili, a young beggar, challenges that exclusive rule. Her age is uncertain, between 10 <b>and</b> 13, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> the streets {{with the help of her}} crutches. She begs for help in the same spot the boys sell their papers, but today they attack her <b>and</b> <b>she</b> falls, rolling over and over. Thatâ€™s it; she too will sell newspapers starting tomorrow.|$|R
60|$|But we {{all know}} that Nature is a goddess with no sense of decency, for whom the proprieties are simply non-existent; men and women in her eyes have but one point of interest, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> abroad, with her {{fashioning}} fingers, setting in order the only work she cares for. All the rest is subsidiary, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> is callous to suffering and to death, indifferent to the Ten Commandments and even to the code of Good Society.|$|R
