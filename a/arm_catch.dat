50|$|The first WWF Inferno Match {{started with}} The Undertaker kicking Kane into the {{turnbuckle}} and dragging {{his hand to}} the flames but Kane turned things round and kicked The Undertaker into the turnbuckle. Undertaker quickly grabbed Kane's hand and threw him into the opposing turnbuckle and ran into a diving crossbody before twisting Kane's hand and walked the top rope for Old School as the flames shot high. Kane soon fought The Undertaker to the mat, trying to push his face underneath the ropes into the flames but Undertaker delivered a thumb to his opponent's weak eye. Paul Bearer threw a chair to Kane which helped him knock Undertaker to the ground, but it did little good as he soon fought back when he was dragged by his hair near the flames. The two continued to fight back and forth, with no obvious dominant wrestler despite a chokeslam from both parties. Undertaker almost set himself on fire when Kane sidestepped a leaping flying clothesline and landed just short of the flames. Kane replied by going to the top rope but the ropes were shaken underneath him, seeing him fall fowl to a superplex. As the two recovered, Undertaker sidestepped a running attack and threw Kane over the top ropes though he did not catch fire. Kane then began to leave the arena but was prevented from this by the returning Vader, who fought Kane back towards the ring where both men met with an over the top rope suicide dive. All the while, Paul Bearer had grabbed a steel chair and was walking round to hand it to Kane only for Undertaker to grab it and kick Bearer away, knocking Kane out with a shot. Undertaker then chased Bearer away up to the band stage and put his head through a bass drum, making him bleed. As Undertaker walked back down to the ring, he delivered a big boot, forcing Kane to fall backwards onto the ring and flames making his right <b>arm</b> <b>catch</b> ablaze and he ran from the arena.|$|E
5000|$|A rare but {{interesting}} mechanical escapement is John Harrison's grasshopper escapement {{invented in}} 1722. In this escapement, the pendulum {{is driven by}} two hinged arms (pallets). As the pendulum swings, {{the end of one}} <b>arm</b> <b>catches</b> on the escape wheel and drives it slightly backwards; this releases the other arm which moves out of the way to allow the escape wheel to pass. When the pendulum swings back again, the other <b>arm</b> <b>catches</b> the wheel, pushes it back and releases the first arm and so on. The grasshopper escapement has been used in very few clocks since Harrison's time. Grasshopper escapements made by Harrison in the 18th century are still operating. Most escapements wear far more quickly, and waste far more energy. The lack of friction is the basis of its accuracy. It's used in the Burgess Clock B that Guinness World Records cited in 2015 as the most accurate open-air mechanical clock, deviating [...] of a second during 100 days. It continues to run and oscillate ±0.5 seconds around 0.00 seconds of error after 2 years after a barometric correction was applied.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "Longuès-Brèsses" [...] (Long-bras in French, Long-arms in English) {{is a type}} of clown {{with long}} arms. He uses his <b>arms</b> to <b>catch</b> a spectator's hat which he then puts on the head of another person.|$|R
50|$|Everyone on Earth is nervously {{awaiting}} news, {{but none}} comes. Lee takes the Soviet flag from a dead cosmonaut and {{lays out the}} Soviet flag on a nearby rock with his own American flag. With little air left and nowhere to go, Lee spins the toy mouse his son gave him. It points right, so he walks in that direction. People on Earth are losing hope as his time has run out. Lee {{looks at his watch}} to see that he has just minutes of air left. A red glow on his <b>arm</b> <b>catches</b> his attention. It is the locator beacon atop the shelter. Lee is last seen walking towards the shelter and survives.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile,Wesley and Gunn enter a guarded {{building}} {{and find a}} room with countless artifacts and expensive items. An <b>armed</b> man <b>catches</b> them and threatens to call the police, but Wesley and Gunn threaten the artifacts and the man lets them get what they came for.|$|R
5000|$|Among his lasting {{records and}} achievements, Greg Boyer is {{credited}} {{with the creation of}} the [...] "Boyer shot". This water polo move incorporates a quick, lateral movement coupled with a shot in order to get around opposing defenders' <b>arms</b> and <b>catch</b> goalkeepers off guard.|$|R
25|$|During the off-season, Marquis tweaked his {{delivery}} {{to improve his}} release point by staying over the rubber longer in his balance point, allowing his <b>arm</b> to <b>catch</b> up, resulting in a 2 to 3inches longer stride, and leaving him {{on top of the}} ball and throwing downhill. Reporters attributed his first-half success to his new delivery and his high ground ball ratio.|$|R
50|$|Ophiothrix suensoni is a detritivore and {{suspension}} feeder. It hides {{during the}} day and emerges at night to feed. It climbs to a high point on its host sponge or sea rod and extends some of its <b>arms</b> to <b>catch</b> plankton and suspended particles floating past. It also feeds on the organic film that is found on the surface of its host.|$|R
60|$|The boatman {{held up his}} <b>arms</b> to <b>catch</b> {{the unfortunate}} man, but his {{strength}} availed nothing against such a weight. He was hurled {{into the bottom of}} the boat for his pains, and the captain went into the water feet first as deep as the waist. Here, however, the disaster was checked, for his strong arms caught the boat and held on.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the last}} word, the {{children}} forming the arch drop their <b>arms</b> to <b>catch</b> {{the pair of}} children currently passing through, who are then [...] "out" [...] and must form another arch next to the existing one. In this way, the series of arches becomes a steadily lengthening tunnel through which each set of two players have to run faster and faster to escape in time.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The article designs a seven joints {{robot arm}} using PC-based controller. The robot arm {{contains}} seven DC servomotors, seven driver devices and a NI motion control card and uses proximity sensors {{to locate the}} limit position, and programs motion trajectories to finish assigned tasks. We tune {{the parameters of the}} PID controller for each joint of the robot arm, and get the nice response to control the robot arm moving to the assigned position. The user interface is developed in the supervised computer using Visual Basic. The supervised computer (controller) computes the kinematic equations of the seven joints robot arm, and calculates the motion displacement of each joint using inverse kinematic equation. Users can program the motion paths on the user interface. The controller of the robot arm can implement precision point to point motion trajectories according to the programmed motion trajectories. In the experimental result, users can write words on the user interface. The robot <b>arm</b> <b>catches</b> the pin to write the assigned word on the plane...|$|R
60|$|Katie {{certainly}} was there, and when, {{over the heads}} of the people--for she had mounted with characteristic energy on the parapet, assisted by Queeker and accompanied by Fanny Hennings--she beheld Stanley Hall in such a plight, she felt a disposition to laugh and cry and faint all at once. She resisted the tendency, however, although the expression of her face and her rapid change of colour induced Queeker with anxious haste to throw out his <b>arms</b> to <b>catch</b> her.|$|R
60|$|She was {{pointing}} to the canyon below. The veranda actually projected over its brink, and seemed to hang in mid air above it. Mainwaring almost mechanically threw his <b>arm</b> out to <b>catch</b> the incautious girl, who had stepped heedlessly to its extreme edge.|$|R
50|$|During this time, Mizumi takes Toby to the Ministry of Prophecies {{where they}} select a prophecy for Toby. Toby only hears {{part of the}} prophecy, leaving out a {{dangerous}} omen of things to come. When Toby and Mizumi return to the castle, Toby sees Moppet falling. Desperate to save her, he magically extends his <b>arms</b> to <b>catch</b> her, {{but in the process}} of saving her life knocks her mask off to reveal her true face. Toby instantly recognizes her as a younger version of his sister, Sarah, but having pale hair and different coloring.|$|R
50|$|Symbolically {{reviving}} {{this practice}} for the parade festivities, a jester tosses plush children's-toy cats from the Cloth Hall belfry down to the crowd, which awaits with outstretched <b>arms</b> to <b>catch</b> one. The throwing of the cats from the belfry {{is followed by a}} mock witch burning. Participants in the festivities often dress as cats, witches, mice, or townspeople from ages past, and the festival also features brass bands and people riding on horseback. Around 2,000 people participated in the 2012 parade. The festival is a popular tourist event in Belgium and has helped strengthen the local tourist economy around Ypres. 8,000 people visited the event in 2000.|$|R
60|$|My horse hitched low his head. Red apples rolled before him; Eve's apples; seek-no-furthers. He tasted one, I another; {{it tasted}} of the ground. Fairy land not yet, thought I, flinging my bridle to a humped old tree, that crooked out an <b>arm</b> to <b>catch</b> it. For the way now lay where path was none, and none might go but by himself, and only go by daring. Through {{blackberry}} brakes {{that tried to}} pluck me back, though I but strained towards fruitless growths of mountain-laurel; up slippery steeps to barren heights, where stood none to welcome. Fairy land not yet, thought I, though the morning is here before me.|$|R
50|$|Crinoids are {{suspension}} feeders {{and spread}} their <b>arms</b> wide to <b>catch</b> particles floating past. These are {{caught by the}} tube feet on the pinnules, moved into the ambulacral grooves, wrapped in mucus and conveyed to the mouth by the cilia lining the grooves. The exact dietary requirements of crinoids have been little researched but in the laboratory they can be fed with diatoms.|$|R

6000|$|In {{front of}} Donaldson's Hospital, John counted it {{good fortune to}} {{perceive}} a cab a great way of, and by much shouting and waving of his <b>arm,</b> to <b>catch</b> the notice of the driver. He counted it good fortune, for the time was long to him till {{he should have done}} for ever with the Lodge; and the further he must go to find a cab, the greater the chance that the inevitable discovery had taken place, and that he should return to find the garden full of angry neighbours. Yet when the vehicle drew up he was sensibly chagrined to recognise the port-wine cabman of the night before. 'Here,' he could not but reflect, 'here is another link in the Judicial Error.' ...|$|R
60|$|They understood. All of {{them had}} guessed it, almost before the summons came that had brought them to Paris two days ago. Sir Andrew Ffoulkes had left his young wife because of that, and Armand had demanded it as a right to join hands in this noble work. Blakeney had not left France for over three months now. Backwards and {{forwards}} between Paris, or Nantes, or Orleans to the coast, where his friends would meet him to receive those unfortunates whom one man's whole-hearted devotion had rescued from death; backwards and forwards into the very hearts of those cities wherein an army of sleuth-hounds were on his track, and the guillotine was stretching out her <b>arms</b> to <b>catch</b> the foolhardy adventurer.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, Ray {{installed}} Boy with Frog, {{his first}} outdoor commissioned work, at the Punta della Dogana, Venice. Grand {{in size and}} realized with a smooth white finish that references the important tradition of marble sculpture in Italy, it depicted a boy holding a goliath frog above the Grand Canal. The sculpture called to mind the Apollo Sauroktonos, an ancient Roman sculpture at the Musée du Louvre in Paris of a nude adolescent reaching out his <b>arm</b> to <b>catch</b> a lizard climbing a tree; and, the Boy with Thorn (Lo Spinario), a bronze statue at the Palazzo dei Conservatori, Musei Capitolini, of a seated Roman boy plucking a thorn from the sole of his foot. The statue was removed in 2013 and replaced with a lamp-post that had previously occupied the site.|$|R
50|$|In football, each team's goalkeeper defends his/her team's {{goal and}} has special {{privileges}} within the game. The goalkeeper's main {{job is to}} stop any penetration of {{the ball into the}} goal. The goalkeeper is the only player in the side who may use his or her hands and <b>arms</b> to <b>catch,</b> throw and save the ball, but only within his/her own penalty area. Goalkeepers are required to wear a distinctive color jersey, separate from the referee's jersey color and either team's regular jersey color, so the referee can easily identify them. There are no other specific requirements, but goalkeepers are usually allowed to wear additional protective gear such as padded clothing. Most goalkeepers also wear gloves to protect their hands and enhance their grip of the ball. Like every player on the pitch, they are required to wear shin guards.|$|R
50|$|Another {{sensation}} often {{experienced by}} a user of a balance board is {{the sensation of}} falling. Apart from actually falling, this often occurs during sharp accelerations caused by leaning too far or too quickly. Feeling like falling can raise fears and provoke reflexes that while useful on a stable surface can be counter-productive on a balance board, such as throwing the <b>arms</b> forward to <b>catch</b> the fall or over-correcting and sharply shifting weight onto the opposite leg, causing a fall in the opposite direction.|$|R
30|$|When {{analyzing}} the recognition rates {{on a per}} category basis, we can observe that three gestures yield RR(1) recognition rates greater than 92 %: juggle (F), cover one’s ears (H) and stretch out (K). Very good performances are also obtained for the Tie shoelaces (B), Kneel (J), gestures, which yield RR(1) recognition rates superior to 82 %. For the Say “thank you” in ASL (A), Rotate on oneself (D) and Throw an object in front (G) gestures, the RR(1) scores slightly lower (75.5, 57.1, and 63.3 %, respectively). The lowest RR(1) scores concern the Draw a circle with the right <b>arm</b> (C), <b>Catch</b> an object (E), and Rub one’s eyes (I) gestures. However, even in these cases, the correct category is obtained in more than 52.1 % of cases in the top two candidates (RRcum(2)) and in 64.6 % cases {{in the top three}} (RRcum(3)).|$|R
50|$|Air braking {{involves}} standing {{upright on}} your board {{as tall as}} possible with <b>arms</b> outstretched to <b>catch</b> as much wind resistance as possible. This is primarily done in speedboarding to reduce speed before a tight turn. It {{is not meant to}} stop the rider, but rather slow the rider to maintain control and stability. The effect is most noticeable at higher speeds and can be enhanced by deploying a Sporting-Sail, jacket or other article of clothing, forming a parachute. This can also be achieved by spreading your arms and standing up from your tuck.|$|R
50|$|Fairbairn was {{an early}} proponent of {{training}} his crews to slide in their seats to facilitate leg-drive. He had realised that the secret to world-champion sculler Ned Hanlan's uncanny successes was not that he rowed a longer stroke, but rather that he used his legs to great effect during the stroke. He was also an advocate of fitting longer slides into boats to better allow {{the use of the}} legs. Fairbairn's observations led him to develop a revolutionary rowing style featuring concurrent use of the legs, back and <b>arms</b> at the <b>catch.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Henry Rowengartner (Nicholas), 12-year-old Little Leaguer, has {{dreams of}} playing in the major leagues, {{although}} he is not very skilled.

5000|$|At church, Gabrielle quietly {{plays with}} a baby which causes Carlos to {{ask her if she}} has reconsidered having a baby. Gabrielle reminds him that she has just {{suffered}} a miscarriage and would like to postpone her pregnancy plans for a while until she has made a final decision. As they argue, Father Crowley announces the return of Sister Mary Bernard who has arrived back in the United States after being gone for two months, to Gabrielle's surprise. Later Carlos tells Sister Mary that Gabrielle will not reconsider her position on a baby. Sister Mary offers to help Carlos by giving him a packet on Catholic annulment. Carlos gives the brochure to Gabrielle who believes that she cannot be [...] "blackmailed into having a baby". Gabrielle visits Father Crowley in the church and asks if Sister Mary can be transferred. Father Crowley asks Gaby why which leads Gabrielle to complicate matters by saying that Carlos and Sister Mary are having an affair and that in his sleep he murmurs her name. Father Crowley asks if she has serious reasons to think they're having sex together. Thinking a little, she says yes. Father Crowley looks mortified and leaves the confessional. Gabrielle stays in the confessional and confesses to another priest that she lied. The next day, Carlos tells her that Sister Mary is being transferred to Fairbanks, Alaska and she doesn't know the reason. Gabrielle returns to the church to gloat and say goodbye. As Gabrielle leaves, Sister Mary throws a scrub brush at her which causes a fight. Gabrielle punches Sister Mary and Sister Mary grabs her by the hair. Sister Mary is pushed into candles and her <b>arm</b> <b>catches</b> fire. Gabrielle quickly extinguishes the fire and Sister Mary bites her on the arm. They tumble on the floor and a priest breaks up the fight. School children and Sister Greta watch the fight from a distance. When she arrives home, Carlos yells at Gabrielle about what she has done. The baby discussion then reignites and Gabrielle tells Carlos that she is not [...] "a uterus in high heels". Carlos accepts Gabrielle's offer to not divorce and Gabrielle tells Carlos she has accepted his offer and wants to have a baby with him.|$|R

25|$|The {{shoulder}} joint {{is the most}} frequently dislocated major joint of the body. In a typical case of a dislocated shoulder, a strong force that pulls the shoulder outward (abduction) or extreme rotation of the joint pops the ball of the humerus out of the shoulder socket. Dislocation commonly occurs {{when there is a}} backward pull on the <b>arm</b> that either <b>catches</b> the muscles unprepared to resist or overwhelms the muscles. When a shoulder dislocates frequently, the condition is referred to as shoulder instability. A partial dislocation where the upper arm bone is partially in and partially out of the socket is called a subluxation. In the medical community, dislocation is commonly referred to as luxation.|$|R
50|$|Hale deduces that Deakins {{intends to}} use a train to {{transport}} the warhead. Stowing on the train, Terry tries to sabotage the warhead but is caught by Deakins and is forced to enter the <b>arming</b> code. <b>Catching</b> up to a train on a USAF helicopter with Colonel Wilkins (Delroy Lindo), Hale saves Terry before Deakins can throw her off the train. A gunfight ensues and the USAF helicopter crashes; Wilkins and most of Deakins' mercenaries are killed. Deakins has prepared a remote that can either disarm or detonate the warhead and prepares to depart the train on his own getaway helicopter, however Hale's sabotage of the helicopter's fuel pump causes it to explode, leaving Deakins and Kelly without the means to get clear of the nuclear blast. With his plan falling apart, Deakins decides to arm the warhead regardless with a short countdown timer. Not wanting to die, Kelly holds Deakins at gunpoint and orders him to disarm the weapon. Hale sneaks up on them during their bickering and kicks Kelly out of the boxcar to his death, then engages in a gun battle with Deakins.|$|R
5000|$|The cartoon {{begins with}} Wile E. Coyote waiting at his mailbox. He {{looks up to}} see a U.S. Mail {{helicopter}} which drops a big box with a parachute attached to it. As Wile E. holds out his <b>arms</b> to <b>catch</b> the box, Road Runner runs by and taunts him long enough so that he forgets about the descending package which lands on top of his head. After some more taunting from Road Runner which causes his backside to be pricked by a cactus, Wile E. opens his package to reveal a chemistry set. Wile E. wastes no time as he pours red liquid back and forth between two beakers until it vanishes completely. He pours the invisible liquid into a bucket marked [...] "Invisible Paint" [...] paints himself invisible with it (he is outlined for the viewers to keep track of his presence). Wile E. gets into position to catch Road Runner near the side of a cliff, but the Road Runner runs into him and knocks him off. For good measure, the Road Runner paints a giant boulder and pushes it off the cliff; it lands on top of the unsuspecting Coyote.|$|R
5000|$|The anchor {{consists}} of an escape wheel with pointed, backward slanted teeth, and an [...] "anchor"-shaped piece pivoted above it which rocks from side to side, linked to the pendulum. The anchor has slanted pallets on the <b>arms</b> which alternately <b>catch</b> on {{the teeth of the}} escape wheel, receiving impulses. Mechanically its operation has similarities to the verge escapement, and it has two of the verge's disadvantages: (1) The pendulum is constantly being pushed by an escape wheel tooth throughout its cycle, and is never allowed to swing freely, which disturbs its isochronism, and (2) it is a recoil escapement; the anchor pushes the escape wheel backward during part of its cycle. This causes backlash, increased wear in the clock's gears, and inaccuracy. These problems were eliminated in the deadbeat escapement, which slowly replaced the anchor in precision clocks.|$|R
