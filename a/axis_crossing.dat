25|$|Tukhachevsky {{launched}} his offensive on 4 July, along the Smolensk–Brest-Litovsk <b>axis,</b> <b>crossing</b> the Auta and Berezina rivers. The northern 3rd Cavalry Corps, led by Gayk Bzhishkyan (Gay Dmitrievich Gay, Gaj-Chan), were to envelop Polish {{forces from the}} north, moving near the Lithuanian and Prussian border (both of these belonging to nations hostile to Poland). The 4th, 15th, and 3rd Armies were to push west, supported from the south by the 16th Army and Mozyr Group. For three days {{the outcome of the}} battle hung in the balance, but Soviet numerical superiority proved decisive and by 7 July Polish forces were in full retreat along the entire front. However, due to the stubborn defense by Polish units, Tukhachevsky's plan to break through the front and push the defenders southwest into the Pinsk Marshes failed.|$|E
25|$|Simultaneous {{operations}} were begun against Yevgebiy Ptukhin's VVS KOVO (Kiev) South-Western Front. Alexander Löhr's Luftflotte 4 supported Gerd von Rundstedt's Army Group South {{which was to}} capture Kiev and conquer the Ukraine. The Southwestern Front, Red Army was quick to react, destroying bridges along the River Bug. The Germans prepared pontoon bridges, and the VVS South West tried to halt the <b>Axis</b> <b>crossing</b> points. The Soviets claimed to have cause havoc among the advancing Germans but 2 and 4 BAK suffered significant losses against Kurt Pflugbeil's Fliegerkorps IV. JG 3 were particularly successful, shooting down 18 bombers on 23 June. Although the Luftwaffe acknowledged that the VVS KOVO offered it the strongest resistance in June 1941, it did not save Ptukhin, who was arrested on 24 June and shot in February 1942. Indeed, the air battles had been costly for Luftflotte 4 and German Army reconnaissance units, which lost 92 aircraft (55 written off) from the 22 to 25 June. In return, they flew 1,600 sorties against 77 Soviet airbases, and destroyed 774 Soviet aircraft {{on the ground and}} 89 in the air. When the Soviet 8th Mechanised Corps resumed an attack against the First Panzer Army, support for the Corps resulted in 22 German aircraft being shot down. Fliegerkorps IV's losses represented the lion's share of otherwise moderate German losses to date.|$|E

40|$|The {{cutting speed}} by shaving is {{currently}} estimated {{with the use}} of an approximate formula that is useful for the calculus of the technological parameters, but is far from giving adequate information about the cutting phenomenon.

40|$|Left {{ventricular}} asynergy in {{myocardial infarction}} was assessed quantitatively by computer {{analysis of the}} cross sectional echocardiogram. Short <b>axis</b> <b>cross</b> sectional images of the left ventricle at the levels of the mitral valve, papillary muscle, and apex were recorded by a phased array sector scanner in 30 patients with healed myocardial infarction and 15 normal controls. Endocardial and epicardial short axis images of the left ventricle were transferred from video tape to a minicomputer through the interface circuits, then digitised and processed automatically by a minicomputer. Automatic edge detection of the endocardial and epicardial wall was performed by applying sequential steps including smoothing, second derivative technique, dynamic thresholding, and approximation of boundaries by a spline curve. To quantify regional wall motion, the short <b>axis</b> <b>cross</b> sectional left ventricular wall of each level was divided into eight octants with eight axes at 45 degrees angles from the initial standard axis which was constructed from the geometric centre of the end diastolic left ventricular cavity to the posterior end of {{the right side of}} the interventricular septum. Segmental hemiaxis, segmental area, segmental wall thickness, and those changes during cardiac cycle were measured and calculated in each segment automatically by a computer. Regional contractility of the left ventricle was evaluated by percentage systolic changes of the segmental hemiaxis, area, and wall thickness. These values were significantly reduced in the infarcted left ventricular wall as defined by left ventriculography and electrocardiography. Moreover, percentage hemiaxis changes obtained by quantitative left ventriculography described by Herman and colleagues correlated well with those using our analytical method of cross sectional echocardiography in the corresponding segments. The geometric centre of the left ventricular cavity determined by the computer moved slightly towards the anterior wall during systole in normal subjects, possibly reflecting the anterior swinging motion of the heart. The geometric centre of the left ventricular cavity in myocardial infarction moved towards the infarcted wall, showing that the floating reference system was inferior to the fixed reference system for the quantification of abnormal wall motion in myocardial infarction. In conclusion, a computer analysis of the short <b>axis</b> <b>cross</b> sectional echocardiogram of the left ventricle using the fixed reference system has shown its ability to evaluate left ventricular contraction abnormalities, especially systolic wall thickening, which is relatively free of arbitrary interpretation of the wall motion caused by the anterior swinging motion of the heart...|$|R
