5|$|Although the Sabres {{held the}} Flyers to two {{shots in the}} first period of game one, eight in the second, and were the {{beneficiaries}} of a 1:04 two-man advantage <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> game remained scoreless until the third period when the Flyers connected four times in a 4–1 victory. In game two, the Sabres were held to 19 shots on goal with none coming after Bobby Clarke scored at the 6:43 mark of the third period.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> pair split up, {{but soon}} reunited. The {{relationship}} became more serious as she accompanied {{him in his}} efforts to break through in the music industry, and by 1979 they were discussing marriage, conditional upon his career becoming established. In the meantime she worked in a motor insurance company and in her father's electrical business.|$|E

5|$|<b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> {{prices for}} his {{pictures}} were exceeded only {{by those of}} renowned English artists Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough. Despite his many commissions, however, Stuart was habitually neglectful of finances and {{was in danger of}} being sent to debtors' prison. In 1787, he fled to Dublin, Ireland where he painted and accumulated debt with equal vigor.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria played without Ivan Cheparinov and Kiril Georgiev, {{the former}} due to {{monetary}} disputes, {{and the latter}} because the Bulgarian Chess Federation considered him banned. <b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> entire Bulgarian team was rumored not to be coming (similarly they were absent from the 2015 European Team Chess Championship), as was Greece.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, many {{residential}} buildings {{were located in}} the Fortezza. Following the end of World War II, the city began to expand {{and many of the}} inhabitants moved elsewhere in the city. Rethymno's landward fortifications and many houses within the Fortezza were demolished at this point, but the walls of the Fortezza were left intact. <b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> local prison was housed within the Fortezza.|$|E

5|$|Darkwatch {{was officially}} {{unveiled}} on January 12, 2004, its announcement {{accompanied by a}} showing of its playable multiplayer deathmatch mode, and was originally slated for a Q4 2004 release. <b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> game remained in limbo for several months until May 2005, when High Moon Studios, by then a fully independent development company, found a publisher in Capcom.|$|E
5|$|During the {{modernization}} in the 1980s, three important weapons {{were added to}} the Iowa-class battleships. The first was the CIWS anti-aircraft/anti-missile system discussed above. The other two were missiles for use against both land and sea targets. <b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> NATO Sea Sparrow was to be installed on the reactivated battleships; however, it was determined that the system could not withstand the over-pressure effects when the main battery was fired.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Mubarak's speech, {{contradictory}} {{reports from}} various media sources {{around the world}} stated that either Suleiman or Tantawi was expected to take over.

5|$|The American robin has an {{extensive}} range, estimated at , {{and a large}} population of about 320million individuals. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as least concern. <b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> bird was killed for its meat, but it is now protected throughout its range in the United States by the Migratory Bird Act.|$|E
5|$|The {{trials were}} fraught with irregularities. All three judges were pro-Goebel Democrats, and <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> juror pool of 368 people {{was found to}} have only eight Republicans. Republican appeals courts {{overturned}} Powers' and Howard's convictions, though Powers was tried three more times, resulting in two convictions and a hung jury and Howard was tried and convicted twice more. Both men were pardoned in 1908 by Governor Augustus E. Willson.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, reform {{movements}} in the U.S. (the so-called Progressive movement) made most forms of gambling illegal in most communities. Gambling continued illegally in many places, though, creating new opportunities for criminal enterprises. The 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1919, outlawed the manufacture, transportation, importation, and sale of alcoholic beverages and initiated the Prohibition era. The new law was widely unpopular, and bootlegging became rampant. Galveston's already lax social attitudes allowed this, as well as brothels and other illegal businesses, to blossom in the city. These institutions were so accepted that <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> city required health inspections for prostitutes {{to ensure the safety}} of their clients.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} chorus, Brown enters another room {{surrounded}} by people in animal heads, and performs the third dance sequence in the video with his backup dancers. Towards {{the end of the}} chorus, Brown and his dancers appear back inside the main room and continue dancing. <b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> video is slowed down as Brown and his dancers do flips. In other scenes, he is seen dancing alone with a cane in a rain-filled room, wearing white dress pants, a black tank top and a fedora. Brown then splits into three people, comes back together, takes off his shirt and throws it at the camera, causing its lens to crack.|$|E
5|$|General Crook finally {{understood}} {{the situation as}} his infantry and cavalry fled north through Winchester. He organized a more orderly retreat. Powell's brigade and an infantry brigade led by Colonel Rutherford B. Hayes (future President of the United States) were among the few organized units remaining. They became the rear guard against the pursuing Confederate cavalry. <b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> 2nd West Virginia Cavalry made a charge with sabers drawn—rescuing a portion of Hayes' brigade that became {{cut off from the}} rest of the command.|$|E
5|$|Hawker Siddeley aggressively marketed the Harrier for export. <b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> {{company was}} holding talks with Australia, Brazil, Switzerland, India and Japan. Of these only India became a customer, {{purchasing}} the Sea Harrier. At one point China {{came very close}} to becoming an operator of the first generation Harrier. Following an overture by the UK in the early 1970s, when relations with the West were warming, China became interested in the aircraft as it sought to modernise its armed forces; British Prime Minister James Callaghan noted significant hostility from the USSR over the sales bid. The deal was later cancelled by the UK as part of a diplomatic backlash after China invaded Vietnam in 1979.|$|E

5|$|In 1831, Rundell and Bridge {{sold the}} diamond to the Emanuel Brothers for about 7,200 pounds (today about £). Six {{years later in}} 1837, the Emanuel Brothers sold the Nassak Diamond at a public sale to Robert Grosvenor, the 1st Marquess of Westminster. <b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> Marquess mounted the diamond in the handle of his dress sword. In 1886, the diamond was valued at between 30,000 and 40,000 pounds (today between £ and £), {{due in part to}} its vast gain in brilliancy from the re-cut by Rundell and Bridge.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{problems with the}} terminal building, both the airport's location and surrounding infrastructure were {{the subject of much}} complaint as well. For one, although some 1,700 cars visited the airport daily, the parking lot had only 129 slots, and could not be expanded any further. The airport complex likewise was located directly alongside major city thoroughfares, in particular the city's main highway, the Tomas Confesor Highway, which complicated the flow of traffic in and around the area. <b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> ATO, which was already having difficulty managing vehicular traffic around the airport, proposed banning cargo and delivery trucks from passing through the road in front of the terminal building. However, the city government did not respond.|$|E
5|$|In {{developing}} the opera, Bryars and Morrison decided {{to flesh out}} some of the roles, including Ox, Ygène and Aunt Hermance. They also added a second pair of lovers. <b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> composer considered giving the title role to American rock-singer Tom Waits, who had recorded one of the versions of Bryars's Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet. Bryars was looking for a means of making Ox sound distinct {{from the rest of the}} cast but in the end decided to make it a tenor role. The opera was dedicated to Bryars's mother.|$|E
