40|$|The South African {{electricity}} {{industry has}} seen {{a dramatic increase in}} prices over the past 3 years. This increase has been blanketed across all sectors and is based on a number of factors such as sector, usage and, in the case of domestic pricing, suburb. The cost of electricity in South Africa, particularly to the industrial sector, has been among the lowest in the world. In this paper, we analyse the recent price increases in the South African electricity sector and discuss the price determination mechanism employed by Eskom, South Africa’s electricity provider. We also analyse the revenue and sales of Eskom and review the electricity price from an international perspective. The concept of differential pricing and international benchmarking is analysed as a possibility for the South African industrial electricity industry, so that all sectors are not adversely affected by <b>across-the-board</b> <b>increases.</b> Our aim is to raise the question of whether South Africa’s electricity prices are in line with international increases and to suggest the possibility of differentiated prices in the local electricity sector.

40|$|A firm's {{ability to}} adjust its {{production}} process to economize on low-skilled labor {{when faced with}} a minimum wage increase will differ greatly depending on industry or occupation. For example, more capital-intensive means of cleaning hotel rooms or serving customers at restaurants may not be readily available without degrading service quality. In such situations, the productivity of labor is essentially capped, and firms have few options when the minimum wage increases. This simple observation has implications for studies that rely on microdata {{to examine the effects of}} minimum wage increases. If firms only increase prices in response to a minimum wage increase, employment effects are likely small. If the goal of the minimum wage is to redistribute income from firms and consumers to workers, minimum-wage increases targeted at industries and occupations where such rigidities result in an inelastic demand for labor may achieve the desired goal at a lower cost than <b>across-the-board</b> <b>increases.</b> However, such a scheme causes an inefficient allocation of labor and would be subjected to substantial political pressures that may lead to anomalous results. Additionally, it is unreasonable to conclude that policy makers have the necessary information to skillfully set the minimum wage. ...|$|R

40|$|Using U. S. {{cross-border}} bank exposure data, this study establishes {{a line of}} arguments and findings, which together constitute the following observation: "Deregulation of U. S. banks, via consolidation and a volatile earnings stream, increased volatility in bank lending to emerging economies, and, in due course, worsened the financial crises in emerging economies. " The volatility of U. S. bank lending to emerging economies has increased during the past twenty years. To explain the <b>across-the-board,</b> <b>increasing</b> volatility of U. S. bank emerging market claims, this study turns to the supply side of the equation: the deregulation in the U. S. banking sector that imparted this commonality to their banks' investment patterns to emerging economies. In so doing, it unveils the linkages through which U. S. banking deregulation ratcheted up the volatility of U. S. bank lending into emerging economies. It starts with the detection of a particular feature of U. S. bank emerging market lending that warrants further attention [...] increasing volatility over time. Unlike bank lending from Europe or Japan, U. S. bank lending exhibited the unique feature of increasing volatility over time, regardless of its destination. By looking into domestic push factors that could have contributed to this characteristic, this study identified a temporal association between important deregulation initiatives in the U. S. banking industry and the volatility of emerging market lending by U. S. banks during the same period. This association was then explained by the linkages between the major outcomes of deregulation [...] consolidation of the banking industry and diversification of banking activities [...] and the increased volatility of lending into emerging economies. Together, it argues that the U. S. banking deregulation had the unintended and unanticipated side effect of increasing the volatility of U. S. bank lending into emerging economies...|$|R
40|$|An econometric {{analysis}} of the demand for multiple peril crop insurance is carried out for a sample of 370 Montana wheat farms. The study {{is the first to}} model the farm's participation and coverage-level decisions separately through Heckman two-stage estimation procedures. These decisions are shown to be determined in different ways. In addition, farms with positive expected returns from insurance make coverage-level decisions in different ways from farms with negative expected returns. These differences indicate that adverse selection effects limit the efficacy of <b>across-the-board</b> premium rate <b>increases</b> as mechanisms for reducing loss ratios.

40|$|The study {{discussed}} in this article investigated the impact of a short self-management skills training course on frontline bank employees' learning about the use of self-management to overcome obstacles to the initiation of banking product sales, perceived self-efficacy in initiating the sale of a product, and performance in activities related to customer service. Trainees' scores on these measures were compared with a control group at three times (prior to training, four weeks posttraining, and twenty-four weeks posttraining). The results suggest that self-management training can be a valuable intervention in itself and need not be used solely as a posttraining intervention. Possible explanations for the <b>across-the-board</b> <b>increase</b> in performance observed in the study are discussed, as are some practical and ethical implications of this observation...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} whether {{the academic performance}} of non-eligible students - in an institutional setting of full inclusion - are affected by special education resources. Special education resources are per definition provided in a compensatory manner, and are increasingly being targeted to misbehaving students. The hypothesis is thus that special education resources might dampen the negative externalities associated with misbehaving students, and thus work to improve the performance of non-eligible students. We take advantage of a large, <b>across-the-board</b> <b>increase</b> in the proportion of eligible students, and combine fixed effects with an IV-approach, to identify the causal effects of special education on {{the academic performance of}} non-eligible students.

40|$|The {{financing}} problems beleaguering {{the public}} pension system have again shifted the spotlight onto the retirement age. This paper examines {{the impact of}} various reform options on the actual retirement choices of older workers. The paper focuses in particular on the long-term implications of the changes implemented in pension legislation since 1992 and the reform options discussed by the German Social Security Reform Commission installed in 2002, the so called "Rürup Commission". Our simulations show that the early-retirement pension adjustment factors introduced by the 1992 pension reform will, in the long term, raise the average effective age of retirement for men by somewhat less than two years. The <b>across-the-board</b> two-year <b>increase</b> in all the relevant age limits proposed by the "Rürup Commission" would raise the effective average age of retirement of men by about eight months. If the actuarial adjustment factor is increased from 3. 6 % to 6 % per year, the effective average retirement age rises by almost two years. The effects are considerably weaker for women. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of {{software}} patents on entry and exit in 27 narrowly-defined classes of software products, using a dataset with comprehensive coverage of both mature public firms and small privately held firms between 1994 and 2004. Reflecting the complex economics underlying the relationship between patent protection, entry costs and industry structure, we find that patents have a mixture of effects on entry and exit. Controlling for firm and market characteristics, firms are less likely to enter product classes in which there are more software patents. However, all else equal, firms that hold software patents are more likely to enter these markets. The net effect on entry of increasing the number of software patents is difficult to measure precisely: estimates of the effect of an <b>across-the-board</b> 10 % <b>increase</b> in patent holdings on the number of entrants into the average market in this sample range from- 5 % to + 3. 5 %, with quite large standard errors.
