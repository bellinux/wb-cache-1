50|$|<b>Azoic</b> <b>dyeing</b> is a {{technique}} in which an insoluble azo dye is produced directly onto or within the fiber. This is achieved by treating a fiber with both diazoic and coupling components. With suitable adjustment of dyebath conditions the two components react to produce the required insoluble azo dye. This technique of dyeing is unique, in that the final color {{is controlled by the}} choice of the diazoic and coupling components. This method of dyeing cotton is declining in importance due to the toxic nature of the chemicals used.|$|E
30|$|The {{positive}} results obtained by Leptosphaerulina sp. {{and the differences}} obtained between the dyes are explained by {{the differences in the}} biochemistry of the decolorization process. The <b>azoic</b> <b>dyes,</b> Remazol black and Novacron red, are degraded principally by an enzymatic process (Michniewicz et al. 2008); whereas, phthalocyanine dyes (Turquoise Blue) are degraded by a mixture of biophysical and biochemical process. In this case, Turquoise Blue is initially absorbed by the cell wall and after that degraded by the ligninolytic enzymes (Swamy and Ramsay 1999; Kirby et al. 2000). Both types of degradation have a different physiological explanation. In the <b>azoic</b> <b>dyes</b> case, the chemical structure of <b>azoic</b> <b>dyes</b> is related with the presence of phenol groups. Phenol groups are the principal substrate for the ligninolytic enzymes; therefore, the enzymatic enzymes degrade the dye by using the structural similarity between <b>azoic</b> <b>dyes</b> and lignin (Kokol et al. 2007). On the other hand, phthalocyanine dyes are adsorbed in the membrane because they have a copper atom in their structure, copper atoms tend to be absorbed by ligninolytic fungus to further include them in the structure of their enzymes, in this case the dye molecule is absorbed and further degraded by the enzymatic enzymes (Jarosz-Wilkołazka et al. 2002).|$|R

The first hyperpolarizability of these molecules was calculated with PM 3 method, HF/ 6 - 31 G**, HF/ 6 - 31 +G**, HF/ 6 - 31 ++G**, DFT with B 3 LYP and B 3 PW 91 functional, and MP 2 / 6 - 31 ++G** based on finite field approach using GAUSSIAN 03 program. The effects of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor to the acceptor groups on the molecular geometry and atomic charge distribution of these NLO chromophores are derived from its HF, MP 2 and DFT calculations. The variation of this property has also been correlated to E (HOMO-LUMO) gap and {{to the nature of}} the highest occupied molecular orbital HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital HOMO.

30|$|Several {{trials of}} {{contaminant}} removal were performed with different natural and inorganic coagulant agents.

Low doses of CDF (ca. 100  mg L− 1) were able to remove more than 70  % of surfactant and more than 85  % of dye (initial pollutant concentration of ca. 100  mg L− 1) and it presented no temperature affection and worked at a relatively wide pH range.

These two processes present interesting economic potential that, however, still needs to be improved for further development at an industrial level. Herein, these two kinds of process are combined in the same cell to improve their economic feasibility.

Both the electro-Fenton (EF) method with a cheap compact graphite cathode and electrochemical oxidation (EO) at a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode were used. EO gave higher abatement of total organic carbon (TOC), but drastically higher energetic consumptions than EF. It is worth mentioning that very different operating conditions were set for EF and EO to optimize their performances. The utilization of three cells in series, all working with EO, allowed {{an increase in the}} abatement, but gave rise to quite high energetic consumptions. Conversely, in the case of EF, the utilization of three reactors in series gave rise to a slight increase in the abatement of the TOC, because of the formation of products that are resistant to EF. The utilization of two reactors in series, devoted respectively to EF and EO, each working at optimized operating conditions, gave very good figures of merit in terms of the abatement of TOC and energetic consumption.

According to the author’s knowledge, catalysts such as TiO 2 doped with metals show high efficiency in degrading MeO; however, this presents economic limitations on industrial scale. Black sand can be considered as a naturally doped catalyst because in its structure is common to find compounds such as titanium, iron and aluminum oxides, also elements such as zircon, cadmium, manganese, etc. This study reports the photocatalytic activity of the mineral black sand used as semiconductor in the discoloration of MeO by oxidation and reduction photocatalytic techniques. For this, magnetic composites from the mineral were prepared (RM, M 1, M 2 and NM) and their activity were tested through MeO discoloration while TiO 2 was used as reference. For the fractions, chemical, morphological and structural characterizations were performed using Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-Ray (SEM-EDX), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis. M 2 fraction showed higher MeO discoloration (93 %) in oxidation conditions at pH 2 and it could be due to the presence of ferric oxides.

RED can be potentially used for the simultaneous {{generation of electrical energy}} and the treatment of waters contaminated by recalcitrant pollutants. The advantages of using the RED process for such dual purpose are: the utilization of a green reagent such as the electron, a good removal of numerous refractory pollutants, the lower requirements for transporting or stocking chemical reagents and the generation of electric energy The selection of the redox process is very important in order to obtain a good performance of RED.

Includes bibliographical references (page xvii-xx). Environmental pollution has been confessed {{as one of the}} major troublesome of the 21 st century. Most severely damaged part of this planet is its precious unique water bodies and in this deterioration textile and dyeing industries playing a major role as releasing intensely complex effluent containing highly toxic and long persistent <b>Azoic</b> <b>dyes</b> with extreme physiochemical condition. The existing physical and chemical effluent treatment methods are not cost effective. As those treatments generate huge amount of sludge and to dispose the sludge is a major problem. On the contrary Biological treatment using acclimatized microorganisms could remove 99 - 100 % dye colour from wastewater. Hence nowadays most of the research is concentrated on biotransformation of textile azo dyes by adapted organisms. Modern bio-treatment offers a cheaper and environmentally friendly alternative for color removal of textile effluents which is very fascinating. So this research is to find out some highly effective Azo dye degrading bacterial isolates from effluent disposal areas soil. The bacterial inoculums were isolated from effluent soil samples and then applied for azo dye decolourization into flasks containing azo dyes as a sole carbon source (1 g/L) with trace amounts of yeast extract, glucose, peptone and some others essential salts and incubated for 5 days to observe their decolourizing ability. The decolourization was inferred from the decrease in the optical density of the dye effluent. The bacterial strains identefied in the study were Entorococcus termitis, Entorococcus camelliae, Bacillus farraginis, Bacillus muralis, Paenibacillus macerans, Bacillus decolorationis, and Macrococcus brunensis. Out of these isolates Entorococcus termitis, Bacillus farraginis, Paenibacillus macerans, Bacillus decolorationis emerged out to be most potent decolourizer, being selected for further studies. Bacillus farraginis was identified as the best decolourizer of OM 2 R (Orange M 2 R) dye that decolourized 98 % of the dye and Paenibacillus macerans showed maximum decolourization on GGS(Green GS) dye that decolourized 97 % of the dye. The effect of pH, NaCl, temperature and initial concentration of dye was studied with an aim to determine the optimal conditions required for maximum decolourization. The research showed different decolourization rate with varying parameters. The optimum pH for decolourization of OM 2 R and GGS dye was 7. 0, the optimum NaCl concentration for decolourization was 2 %, initial dye concentration was 1 % and the temperature was 370 C for optimum decolourization by the selected isolates. The findings are well acclimatized and have potentials for bioremediation in textile waste effluent treatment plants. Fahim Ahmed AlifB. Biotechnolog...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the physico-chemical effects {{occasioned by}} the cold plasma {{discharge}} (CPD) on the photo-decolorization of Reactive Orange 16 (RO 16) by 3 D fabrics (spacer fabrics) loaded with ZnO:TiO 2 nano-photocatalysts (nphs) were optimized via response surface methodology (RSM). CPD was employed to improve the surface characteristics of the spacer fabrics for nphs loading. Surface morphology and color variation were studied utilizing scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and CIE-Lab system, respectively. The effect of CPD on the wetting ability of the spacer fabrics was examined using dynamic adsorption measurement (DAM). Also, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) was utilized to investigate the durability of the nphs on the spacer fabrics. All the experiments were implemented in a Box-Behnken design (BBD) with three independent variables (CPD treatment time, dye concentration and irradiation time) in order to optimize the decolorization of RO 16. The anticipated values of the decolorization efficiency {{were found to be}} in excellent agreement with the experimental values (R 2 = 0. 9996, Adjusted R 2 = 0. 9992). The kinetic analysis demonstrated that the photocatalytic decolorization followed the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model. In conclusion, this heterogeneous photocatalytic process is capable of decolorizing and mineralizing <b>azoic</b> reactive <b>dye</b> in textile wastewater. Moreover, the results confirmed that RSM based on the BBD was a suitable method to optimize the operating conditions of RO 16 degradation...|$|R
40|$|Treatment of {{coloured}} {{effluent treatment}} {{is a major}} issue for the textile industry. In this study, catalyst P 25 -graphene was prepared and applied for degrading dye from an aqueous solution. Three types of dyes were selected to determine the feasibility of the catalyst for the dye degradation, including sulphonic, <b>azoic,</b> and fluorescent <b>dyes.</b> P 25 -graphene catalyst showed good ability to degrade all selected dyes. The influence of inorganic salts and surfactants on the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B using catalyst P 25 -graphene was also investigated. The degradation of rhodamine B was suppressed {{by the presence of}} NaCl, but the effect of Na 2 SO 4 was negligible. The degradation of rhodamine B was significantly suppressed by all three types of surfactant, namely anionic, cationic and non-ionic surfactants. NMR technique was used to investigate the mechanisms associated with this suppression...|$|R
40|$|The dyeing {{of cotton}} can be {{problematic}} to the dyeing industry when dyeing with different dye classes because {{a significant amount}} of dyes find their way into effluents. Cotton dyed with different class of dyes suffers from washing-off, wash-fastness, light-fastness, rubfastness and ring-dyeing problems. A method to increase the substantivity for the cotton fiber is to create a positive charge on the fiber. For this purpose the cotton fiber was pretreated with cationising agents Servon XRK and NMM derivative. Servon XRK and NMM derivative were used as part of EU Frame Work V. Servon XRK (3 -chloro- 2 -hydroxy-N, N, N-trimethyl-l-propanaminium chloride) and NMM derivative [4 -(3 -chloro- 2 - hydroxypropyl) - 4 -methylmorpholin- 4 -ium chloride) ] were applied to cotton by pad-batch method. In this research vat <b>dyes,</b> acid <b>dyes,</b> <b>azoic</b> colourants and reactive dyes have been used. The dyeings from vat dyes gave improved colour yield values when applied to the Servon XRK and NMM modified cotton fabrics as compared to the unmodified cotton fabrics. The dyeings from anthraquinone vat dyes (Cl Vat Violet 1, Cl Vat Red 13 and Cl Vat Green 1) on modified (Servon XRK and NMM) cotton fabric absolutely did not lose any colour in wash-off liquor as the dyeings from anthraquinone vat dyes (Cl Vat Violet 1, Cl Vat Red 13 and Cl Vat Green 1) on the unmodified cotton fabric gave {{a significant amount of}} colour in wash-off liquor. Vat dyes on the modified cotton fabric gave overall better dyeing results than on the unmodified cotton fabric. Disulphonated acid dyes Cl Acid Red 13 and Cl Acid Red 17 gave better wash-fastness results than monosulphonated (Cl Acid Red 88) and trisulphonated (Cl Acid Red 18 and Cl Acid Red 27). The light-fastness results were better for the dyeings from trisulphonated acid dyes than the monosulphonated and disulphonated acid dyes. The dyeings from Cl Acid Blue 193 gave good dyeing results than the dyeings from Cl Acid Violet 92. The overall dyeing results are better for the dyeings obtained by the application o f Naphthol AS to the Servon XRK modified cotton fabric by pad-dry and pad-batch-dry methods followed by coupling than the corresponding dyeings on the unmodified cotton fabric. Sumifix Supra Blue BRF and Sumifix Supra Red 3 BF applied on the Servon XRK modified cotton fabric gave improved dyeing results than applying on unmodified cotton fabric. Reactive dyes co-applied with NMM have given overall better results than when applied without NMM. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
