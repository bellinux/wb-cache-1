5|$|The series {{depicts the}} {{everyday}} lives of office {{employees in the}} Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) reads an article <b>about</b> <b>China</b> growing as a global power and decides it must be stopped before it takes over the United States. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) threatens to move Dunder Mifflin to a new building after everyone in the office complains about Dwight Schrute's (Rainn Wilson) building standards. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) is sick of Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) annoying text messages.|$|E
5|$|Cosmas Indicopleustes, a 6th-century AD Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Greek monk from Alexandria {{and former}} {{merchant}} {{with experience in}} the Indian Ocean trade, was the first Roman to write clearly <b>about</b> <b>China</b> in his Christian Topography (c. 550 AD). He called it the country of Tzinista (comparable to Sanskrit Chinasthana and Syriac Sinistan from the 781 AD Nestorian Stele of Xi'an, China), located in easternmost Asia. He explained the maritime route towards it (first sailing east and then north up the southern coast of the Asian continent) {{and the fact that}} cloves came that way to Sri Lanka for sale. By the time of the Eastern Roman ruler Justinian I (r. 527–565 AD), the Byzantines purchased Chinese silk from Sogdian intermediaries. They also smuggled silkworms out of China with the help of Nestorian monks, who claimed that the land of Serindia was located north of India and produced the finest silk. By smuggling silkworms and producing silk of their own, the Byzantines could bypass the Chinese silk trade dominated by their chief rivals, the Sasanian Empire.|$|E

5|$|While at the dentist, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) reads {{an article}} about China's growing global power, and he decides that China must be stopped before it takes over the United States. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) tries to correct one of the {{statement}}s, but when Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) checks the fact online, it turns out Michael's statement was correct. Everyone mocks Oscar for his mistake, as Oscar is usually the smartest one in the office, having built this reputation by often correcting his coworkers. Oscar invites Michael {{for a cup of}} coffee, but the other employees realize that Oscar wants to discuss China in more detail, in order to reestablish himself as the office's intellectual heavyweight. Seeing an opportunity to give Oscar a taste of his own medicine, they start quizzing Michael on different facts <b>about</b> <b>China,</b> but he cannot answer, so he makes note cards to keep track. When Michael and Oscar have their conversation, Ryan, Erin, Jim, Andy, and Kelly also sit in to watch. Michael blanks on one topic, but then changes the subject to conversation itself. The employees toast him, while Oscar is left infuriated.|$|E

40|$|In November 2013 China {{declared}} an Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ). Within the already changeable East Asian region China’s neighbours reacted with alarm. Despite increasing apprehension and speculation <b>about</b> <b>China’s</b> assertiveness, this paper argues China’s ADIZ {{is not a}} challenge to the status quo. China’s domestic politics and the specific Sino-Japanese tension over the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands account for the creation, timing and method of establishing the ADIZ. A comparative case study of China’s ADIZ and Japan’s own ADIZ demonstrates that misperceptions <b>about</b> <b>China’s</b> ADIZ rather than the ADIZ itself are more likely to further destabilise the region. 摘要： 2013 年 11 月，中国宣布建立东海防空识别区（ADIZ），东亚这个动荡的地区再次变得风声鹤唳。针对越来越多的对中国强硬态度的各种推测，本文认为，从中国国内形势以及具体的中日关系的角度来看，中国设立防空识别区并不是为了挑战现状。对中国和日本自身防空识别区的比较案例研究有助于理解这个观点，即我们需要更确凿的证据才能得出结论，而不是制造误解，使该区域变得更加不稳定...|$|R

The great interest awakened in England <b>about</b> <b>China</b> through the civil war, which was then erroneously {{supposed to be a}} mass movement toward Christianity, together with the glowing but exaggerated reports made by Karl Gützlaff concerning China's accessibility, led to the founding of the Chinese Evangelisation Society, to the service of which Hudson Taylor offered himself as their first missionary.|$|E
25|$|On October 19, 1944, Stilwell was {{recalled}} {{from his}} command by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Partly {{as a result}} of controversy concerning the casualties suffered by U.S. forces in Burma and partly due to continuing difficulties with the British and Chinese commanders, Stilwell's return to the United States was not accompanied by the usual ceremony. Upon arrival, he was met by two Army generals at the airport, who told him that he was not to answer any media questions <b>about</b> <b>China</b> whatsoever.|$|E
25|$|Just as Ricci {{spent his}} life in China, others of his {{followers}} did the same. This level of commitment was necessitated by logistical reasons: Travel from Europe to China took many months, and sometimes years; and learning the country's language and culture was even more time-consuming. When a Jesuit from China did travel back to Europe, he typically did it as a representative ("procurator") of the China Mission, entrusted {{with the task of}} recruiting more Jesuit priests to come to China, ensuring continued support for the Mission from the Church's central authorities, and creating favorable publicity for the Mission and its policies by publishing both scholarly and popular literature <b>about</b> <b>China</b> and Jesuits. One time the Chongzhen Emperor was nearly converted to Christianity and broke his idols.|$|E

500|$|Truman {{was torn}} two ways <b>about</b> <b>China,</b> where the Nationalists and Communists were {{fighting}} a large-scale civil war. On the one hand, the Nationalists had been major wartime allies and had large-scale popular {{support in the}} United States, along with a powerful lobby. General George Marshall spent most of 1946 in China trying to negotiate a compromise, but failed. He convinced Truman that the Nationalists would never win on their own, and that a very large-scale American intervention to stop the Communists would significantly weaken America's opposition to the Soviets in Europe. By 1949, the Communists under Mao Zedong had won the civil war, the United States had a new enemy in Asia, and Truman came under fire from conservatives for [...] "losing" [...] China.|$|E

Haw dismisses the various anachronistic criticisms of Polo's accounts that started in the 17th century, and highlights Polo's accuracy in great part of his accounts, for example on {{the lay of the land}} such as the Grand Canal of China.

500|$|However, Hergé knew {{as little}} <b>about</b> <b>China</b> {{as he did}} about the Soviet Union or the Belgian Congo. At the time most Belgians held to a {{negative}} stereotype of China, viewing it as [...] "a distant continent of a nation, barbaric, overpopulated, and inscrutable", and Hergé had long believed this view. He had included Chinese characters in two previous Adventures, in both instances depicting them according to traditional European clichés. In Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, he included two pigtailed Chinese men hired by the Bolsheviks to torture Tintin, while in Tintin in America he featured two Chinese hoodlums who plotted to eat Snowy. Hergé learned {{a bit about the}} country from Albert Londres' book China Madness, based on Londres' experiences in the country. He was also influenced in his portrayal of China by the 1933 German film Flüchtlinge (At the End of the World).|$|E
500|$|Michael is {{initially}} worked up <b>about</b> <b>China</b> after reading {{an article in}} Newsweek, an American weekly news magazine.

Andy sends Darryl a text that only reads [...] "Megan Fox", a reference to the actress. Creed notes that he understands, but cannot speak, Pirate slang. Andy attempts to motivate Michael with a pep talk taken from the 1979 movie Rocky II. During Michael and Oscar's discussion {{in the lobby of the}} office building, a copy of Call of Duty can be seen behind the counter.
