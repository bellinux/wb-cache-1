5000|$|Stereoselective {{variants}} of the 2,3-Wittig rearrangement have employed three strategies: diastereoselection {{based on an}} existing, established stereocenter, placement of a chiral auxiliary on the starting material whose configuration is unaffected by the reaction, {{and the use of}} a chiral base. The relative diastereoselection strategy works well only for a limited number of G groups, but usually results in high yields because no chiral <b>auxiliary</b> group needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> or modified. The stereocenter opposite the carbanion usually must be tertiary (rather than quaternary) in order to enforce the placement of the largest substituent in the RE position.(4)The asymmetric induction approach relies on stereocenters already set in the starting material that are unaffected by the reaction (chiral auxiliaries). The most success has been achieved by placing these stereocenters either in the G group or in a substituent attached to the terminal end of the double bond. Diastereomeric ratios in excess of 90:10 are common for these reactions; however, removal of the chiral auxiliary is sometimes difficult.(5)The use of chiral bases has afforded enantioenriched rearrangement products in a few cases, although this method does not appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> general. Enantioselectivity in these reactions is often low, suggesting that the association between the conjugate acid of the base and the rearranging carbanion is likely weak.(6) ...|$|R
40|$|Methods {{to predict}} and fill Landsat 7 Scan Line Corrector (SLC) -off data gaps are diverse and their {{usability}} is case specific. An appropriate gap-filling method {{that can be}} used for seagrass mapping applications has not been proposed previously. This study compared gap-filling methods for filling SLC-off data gaps with images acquired from different dates at similar mean sea-level tide heights, covering the Sungai Pulai estuary area inhabited by seagrass meadows in southern Peninsular Malaysia. To assess the geometric and radiometric fidelity of the recovered pixels, three potential gap-filling methods were examined: (a) geostatistical neighbourhood similar pixel interpolator (GNSPI); (b) weighted linear regression (WLR) algorithm integrated with the Laplacian prior regularization method; and (c) the local linear histogram matching method. These three methods <b>were</b> applied <b>to</b> simulated and original SLC-off images. Statistical measures for the recovered images showed that GNSPI can predict data gaps over the seagrass, non-seagrass/water body, and mudflat site classes with greater accuracy than the other two methods. For optimal performance of the GNSPI algorithm, cloud and shadow in the primary and <b>auxiliary</b> images had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> by cloud removal methods prior to filling data gaps. The gap-filled imagery assessed in this study produced reliable seagrass distribution maps and should help with the detection of spatiotemporal changes of seagrasses from multi-temporal Landsat imagery. The proposed gap-filling method can thus improve the usefulness of Landsat 7 ETM+ SLC-off images in seagrass applications...|$|R
