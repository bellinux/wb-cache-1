Siva and Bhavani later duel on a shopping-complex terrace. Bhavani commits suicide, and Siva walks out as Asha and Venkat watch in dismay.|$|E
5|$|Nickell finally {{consented to}} a {{polygraph}} examination in November 1986. She failed it and investigators narrowed their focus to her even further; however, concrete evidence proving that Nickell had ever purchased or used cyanide was lacking, and despite their relative certainty that Stella Nickell had orchestrated the poisonings as either an elaborate cover-up for an insurance-motivated {{murder of her}} husband, or as {{a desperate attempt to}} force her husband's death to be ruled an accident, to increase her insurance payout, they were unable to build a strong enough case to support <b>an</b> <b>arrest.</b>|$|E

One of Matsui's final acts before going to prison was to ask his wife to adopt their longtime maid Hisae as their daughter. He also converted from Shintoism to Buddhism and asked that his wife do the same. On March 6, 1946, he checked himself in to Sugamo Prison.|$|E

5|$|The {{issue of}} whether the Act was constitutionally valid {{revolved}} around the fact that immigration detention {{is a form of}} administrative detention, or detention imposed by the executive branch of government. Detention generally {{is considered to be a}} judicial function, which can be exercised only by courts, pursuant to Chapter III of the Australian Constitution. However, there are certain exceptions which allow non-judicial detention, such as detention in order to effect <b>an</b> <b>arrest,</b> or detention for quarantine purposes. Courts in Australia have also held that, generally, detention of non-citizens for immigration purposes is also valid.|$|E
50|$|The feud {{continued}} {{on through the}} summer of 1857, with constant confrontations between the rival police forces. When <b>a</b> Municipal <b>arrested</b> <b>a</b> criminal, a Metropolitan would come along and release him. At the police station, <b>an</b> <b>arresting</b> officer would find an alderman and a magistrate from the opposing side waiting. A hearing would be held on the spot and the prisoner released on his own recognizance.|$|R
5000|$|Whether <b>an</b> <b>arrested</b> {{person must}} {{identify}} himself {{may depend on}} the jurisdiction in which the <b>arrest</b> occurs. If <b>a</b> person is under arrest and police wish to question him, {{they are required to}} inform the person of his Fifth-Amendment right to remain silent by giving a Miranda warning. However, Miranda does not apply to biographical data necessary to complete booking.It is not clear whether a [...] "stop and identify" [...] law could compel giving one’s name after being arrested, although some states have laws that specifically require <b>an</b> <b>arrested</b> person to give his name and other biographical information,and some state courtshave held that refusal to give one’s name constitutes obstructing a public officer. As a practical matter, <b>an</b> <b>arrested</b> person who refused to give his name would have little chance of obtaining a prompt release.|$|R

5|$|As part of {{the circle}} around the prince, however, Gaveston also became {{entangled}} in conflicts between the King and his son. These difficulties first materialised in a dispute between treasurer Walter Langton and Prince Edward. The case enraged King Edward {{to the point where}} he banned his son from court, and banished several men from the prince's household. Though the two were reconciled at a later point, the King still prevented Gaveston from rejoining the prince. This matter was settled before 26 May 1306, however, the date when Gaveston was knighted, four days after the prince. Later that year Gaveston was once more in trouble, when he and twenty-one other knights deserted a Scottish campaign to attend a tournament. <b>An</b> <b>arrest</b> order was sent out for the deserters, but, at the insistence of Queen Margaret, they were all pardoned in January 1307.|$|E
5|$|At common law, if a party {{resisted}} arrest by {{an officer}} without warrant {{and who had}} no right to arrest him, and if in the course of that resistance the officer was killed, the offense of the party resisting arrest would be reduced from what would have been murder if the officer had had the right to arrest, to manslaughter. What would be murder if the officer had the right to arrest might be reduced to manslaughter by the very fact that he had no such right. So an officer, at common law, was not authorized to make <b>an</b> <b>arrest</b> without a warrant, for a mere misdemeanor not committed in his presence.|$|E
5|$|Glik v. Cunniffe, 655 F.3d 78 (1st Cir. 2011) {{is a case}} {{in which}} the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that a private citizen has the right to record video and audio of public {{officials}} in a public place, and that the arrest of the citizen for a wiretapping violation violated his First and Fourth Amendment rights. The case arose when Simon Glik, a private citizen, filmed Boston, Massachusetts, police officers making <b>an</b> <b>arrest</b> in a public park. When the officers observed that Glik was recording the arrest, they arrested him and he was subsequently charged with wiretapping, disturbing the peace, and aiding in the escape of a prisoner. Glik then sued the City of Boston and the arresting officers, claiming that they violated his constitutional rights.|$|E
