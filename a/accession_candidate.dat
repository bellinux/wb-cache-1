40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} impacts of Economic and Monetary Union and the euro on {{developments}} within the EU and globally. The emphasis is on euro- 11 countries and the eight most advanced <b>accession</b> <b>candidates</b> in Central and Eastern Europe. The single currency completes the project for a single market in Europe, and overall, clear efficiency gains for participating countries are expected. Low, stable interest rates should spur investment and the single currency should promote the formation of large, liquid capital markets, eventually transforming the structure of financial intermediation within the euro area. Although participating countries achieved {{a high degree of}} nominal convergence in the 1990 s, this process now appears to have ended. Moreover, the conduct of a common monetary policy becomes more problematic with countries at different phases in the economic cycle. <b>Accession</b> <b>candidates</b> may use a variety of foreign exchange rate regimes before they join the EU, but ultimately their economic policies become a matter of common interest. Pressure to peg to the euro obviously increases as membership approaches, but there is compelling evidence that countries should hold back on pegging to the euro until they have achieved sufficient convergence to attain credibility for a policy of fixed exchange rates. ...|$|R

40|$|Following the {{currency}} crises of the 1990 s, most Asian countries {{believed that the}} European Union was their model of integration to prevent future speculative attacks. Ironically, the European Monetary Union (EMU) at present is confronted with two major problems. One is possible speculative attacks during the new members' transition to the EMU. The other is the policy mix problem. This paper combines the two current issues with which the EMU is confronted and explores what {{the consequences of the}} new members' accession will be if there is a fiscal union in the euro area. A dynamic game simulation approach is adopted to study the interaction among an <b>accession</b> <b>candidate,</b> the European Central Bank, and a prospective single fiscal authority in the EMU. The simulation results indicate that a fiscal union in the EMU may be helpful in promoting international policy coordination prior to EMU enlargement and then improving the macroeconomic stability of the <b>accession</b> <b>candidate</b> and the euro area. The result also can be a warning to East Asian governments considering their future policy based on European experience. ...|$|E

How many people will leave the <b>accession</b> <b>candidate</b> countries and how will this affect the Western European countries? This paper presents a forecast of migration between the accession countries and the EU 15 from 2004 to 2015. The forecast is based on the analysis of migration experiences from the accession of Spain, Greece and Portugal. The results of a multiple regression model show that network effects play an important role. Economic factors have a significant impact only on migration into the European countries but not on emigration. The estimated coefficients are used to forecast future migration. Between 2004 and 2015 about 3. 0 million people are expected to migrate temporarily into Western European countries. Permanent migration will be about 1. 7 million people.

40|$|The banking {{sectors in}} several Central and Eastern European {{countries}} {{are characterized by}} a two-tier structure, in which a few large banks dominate the deposit market but are very inactive in the loan market with private borrowers, while many small banks engage in lending but have only small shares of the deposit market. The large banks act as net lenders in the interbank market, while small banks are net borrowers in the market. Typically, the former banks are incumbent institutions from pre-transition times, while the later are new institutions. In this paper, we ask whether this two-tier structure and the resulting interbank trade has any important risk alleviating effects {{on the performance of}} the banking sector. Specifically, we consider the effects on the lending activities of the small banks. We present a model of the credit market based on asymmetric information and moral hazard. Assuming that large banks have monitoring costs benefits compared to depositors regarding the lending activities of the other banks, we show that the two-tier structure induces small banks to engage in less risky lending activities than small banks that finance themselves predominantly in the deposit market. We test this and related hypotheses using financial statement data from banks in 10 EU <b>accession</b> <b>candidate</b> countries. This allows us to compare the financial activities of banks in countries where a two-tier structure prevails with those of small banks in markets where such a pattern is not observed.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to show the justification and importance of explicit inclusion of quality of governance in the debate on economic growth in Croatia. Governance is defined as the manner in which the state employs its power in handling the institutional environment, thus affecting the accumulation of economic growth factors. Although there are numerous elements in the quality of governance, this paper places the emphasis on the whole on two of them: the rule of law and the quality of the public administration. In pursuit of its objective, the paper first of all considers the links between governance and economic growth in growth theory and empirical research to date. After that an econometric (panel) analysis of quality of governance and economic growth on a sample of EU countries and Croatia, Bulgaria and Romania (EU <b>accession</b> <b>candidate</b> countries) is performed, and then changes in the quality of governance in Croatia are considered. From a comparison of the values of indicators of the rule of law and quality of the public administration, and the dynamics and nature of reform in the administration of justice and the civil service, it appears that those in whom power is vested in Croatia are more focused on rent-seeking than is the case in the average of EU countries. Institutional shortcomings have affected the current level of real per capita GDP in Croatia, and more rapid and effective reforms of the justice and public administration sectors, as well as fighting corruption and boosting democracy (as mechanism for controlling those in whom power is vested) would have a positive effect on future economic growth. governance, economic growth, Croatia, rule of law, public administration...|$|E
40|$|Armies require obedient soldiers. However, {{throughout}} history {{there have been}} those who, {{for a variety of}} reasons, have refused to take part in war or to perform military service. The most direct way of objecting to serving a military function is through conscientious objection to the performance of military service. This objection is usually based on principles or reasons of conscience, including profound convictions arising from religious, ethical, moral, philosophical, humanitarian or similar motives. The right to conscientious objection to military service is nowadays recognised by most international mechanisms as the legitimate expression of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. At the European level, there is equally now a consensus on the right to conscientious objection as exemplified in the case of Bayatyan v. Armenia. In the Republic of Turkey conscientious objection to military service is nevertheless still a highly controversial issue. Turkey does not recognise the right to conscientious objection to military service, and it does not provide alternative civilian service. Based on a thorough analysis of international and regional human rights law, this thesis will demonstrate that Turkey is in violation of its international obligations on the issue of conscientious objection to military service, in particular following the Bayatyan, Ercep and Fethi Demirtas judgments from the European Court of Human Rights - the last two judgements directly addressing Turkey. Indeed, as a European x Union <b>accession</b> <b>candidate,</b> the Republic of Turkey must make some expeditious changes in its legal system in order to recognise such a right. This thesis aims to identify where Turkey falls short of its obligations under international human rights law and to show what changes in Turkish law should be made for Turkey to be in compliance with these obligations.

40|$|Research {{into the}} {{structural}} patterns in Central East European economies 2 ̆ 019 aggregate value added or production can draw upon {{a large body}} of literature. However, this research often stops short of assessing what the patterns described tell us in terms of prospects for catching up of each individual <b>accession</b> <b>candidate</b> to European levels of economic development. This distinct lack is mainly rooted in shortcomings of economic theory, which so far is unable to present a coherent theory of integration between unequal partners and catch up development. This paper therefore uses various ad-hoc assumptions (path dependency, hysteresis, learning-curve, product-cycle, etc.) to predict future catch up scenarios for Estonia, Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Hungary, and Slovenia. The focus is on patterns of specialisation in manufacturing industries. A variety of different taxonomies (OECD, WIFO, own classifications) establishing classes of manufacturing industries correspond to the ad-hoc assumptions used and allow careful prediction of individual paths of catching up in industrial productivity levels. The results of this analysis are particularly important for economic policy in accession candidates and at the EU level in terms of targeting structural and cohesion fund policies to their most efficient use. The analysis uses simple empirical methods working with mainly employment and industry-specific productivity data at NACE 3 digit-levels. The paper establishes an empirical model of typical industrial labour productivity growth determined by patterns of specialisation in manufacturing industries and the extent of backwardness by use of past experience both in EU cohesion and EU accession countries. This model is then applied to predict potentials of productivity growth and prospects of productivity catch-up in several distinct scenarios of structural adjustment in EU accession states. The predictions suggest that productivity catch-up will at the very least take more than two decades with Slovenia and the Slovak Republic arriving first. The Czech Republic and Hungary share similar catch-up prospects slightly more favourable as compared to Poland. The results for Estonia are bleak...|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Eurobarometer (EB) survey series is a unique programme of cross-national and cross-temporal comparative social science research. Since the early seventies representative national samples in all European Union (EU) (formerly the European Community (EC)) member states have been simultaneously interviewed {{in the spring and}} autumn of each year. Starting with EB 34. 1 (autumn 1990), separate supplementary surveys on special issues have been conducted under almost every EB number. The EB is designed to provide regular monitoring of public social and political attitudes in the EU through specific trend questions. More information about the series may be found on the Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, Data Archive for the Social Sciences (GESIS) Eurobarometer Survey Series web pages. GESIS was formed in 2007 when three independent institutes merged (Social Science Information Centre (IZ) in Bonn, Central Archive for Empirical Social Research in Cologne (ZA), and Centre for Survey Research and Methodology (ZUMA) in Mannheim). Users should note that earlier EBs are available from GESIS. Background Work on European survey series began in early 1970, when the Commission of the European Community sponsored simultaneous surveys of the EC. These surveys were designed to measure public awareness of, and attitudes toward, the Common Market and other EC institutions, in complementary fashion. They also probed the goals given top priority for each respondent's nation. These concerns have remained a central part of the EC's research efforts - which were carried forward in the summer of 1971 with another six-nation survey that gave special attention to agricultural problems. The nine EC member countries were then surveyed again on the same topic areas in September 1973. After 1973, the surveys took on a somewhat broader scope in content as well as in geographical coverage, with measures of subjective satisfaction and the perceived quality of life becoming standard features of the EC public opinion surveys. Over time, the member states of the EC/EU have increased in number, and the coverage of the EB surveys has widened accordingly. In 1974, nine countries were surveyed: France, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg. Greece has been included since the autumn 1980 survey (EB 14) onwards, Portugal and Spain since autumn 1985 (EB 24), the former German Democratic Republic since autumn 1990 (EB 34), Finland since the spring of 1993 (EB 39), and Sweden and Austria since the autumn of 1994 (EB 42). Norway has been included in some surveys since 1991, from EB 36 onwards. In 2004, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia joined the EU, and in 2007, Bulgaria and Romania (some of these countries participated in the Candidate Countries Eurobarometer survey series (see under GN 33343) before full <b>accession).</b> <b>Candidate</b> countries of Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Iceland have also been included in selected surveys. Some surveys are also conducted in Turkey, and in the Turkish Cypriot Community (Northern Cyprus).

Zaiceva (2006) provides an encompassing overview of the literature on migration projections with respect to EU-enlargement.

Through {{the operation of the}} internal market, international trade by the accession states with the EU will grow.

While there is substantial variance across transition economies on both actual policies and GATS commitments, we find an inverse relationship between the depth of GATS commitments and the “quality ” of actual services policies as assessed by the private sector. In part this can be explained by the fact that the prospect of EU accession makes GATS less relevant as a commitment device for a subset of transition economies. However, for many of the non-EU <b>accession</b> <b>candidates</b> the WTO seems to be a weak commitment device. One explanation is that the small size of the markets concerned generates weak external enforcement incentives. Our findings suggest greater collective investment by WTO members in monitoring and transparency is needed to increase the benefits of WTO membership to small countries.

Time series and panel cointegration {{techniques}} are used {{to show that the}} BS effect works reasonably well in these transition economies during the period 1991 :Q 1 to 2001 :Q 2. However, productivity growth does not fully translate into price in-creases due to the structure of CPI indexes. We thus argue that productivity growth will not hinder the ability of the five EU <b>accession</b> <b>candidates</b> to meet the Maastricht criterion on inflation in the medium term. Moreover, the observed appreciation of the CPI-deflated real exchange rate is found to be systematically higher compared to the real appreciation justi-fied by the Balassa-Samuelson effect, particularly in the cases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. This may be partly explained by the trend appreciation of the tradable-goods-price-based real exchange rate, increases in non-tradable sector prices due to price liberali-sation and demand-side pressures, and the evolution of the nominal exchange rate due to the exchange rate regime and magnitude of capital inflows.
