40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of several agricultural practices on the sugar beet <b>root</b> <b>aphid</b> (Pemphigus betae Doane) and beneficial epigeal natural enemies in western Nebraska sugar beet agroecosystems. Eight glyphosate-tolerant sugar beet varieties were evaluated under field conditions for their resistance to <b>root</b> <b>aphids.</b> High levels of aphid resistance were detected for some varieties. In conjunction to this, pitfall sampling was conducted to determine the beneficial epigeal natural enemy complex in the area, which could contribute to the management of both <b>root</b> <b>aphids</b> and glyphosate-resistant weeds. Ground beetles comprised an important and abundant component of this fauna, with 79 species collected throughout this study. ^ The second investigated {{the impact of a}} seed-applied insecticide (Poncho Beta) and sugar beet plant density (25, 000 plants/acre vs. 35, 000 plants/acre) on <b>root</b> <b>aphids</b> and beneficial epigeal arthropods. The insecticide significantly reduced <b>root</b> <b>aphid</b> populations, but not to levels which can be considered adequate control. Soil-dwelling beneficial arthropods remained largely unaffected by the seed-applied insecticides, except for a single ground beetle species (Bembidion quadrimaculatum oppositum) which showed higher activity in the untreated plots during one of the years. Plant density had minimal impact on the aphids and beneficial arthropods. ^ Finally, this study also investigated the impact of tillage (conventional versus reduced tillage) on beneficial epigeal arthropods, and their associated ecosystem services (particularly weed seed consumption and predation of live prey). Overall, the results indicated a strong incentive for adopting reduced tillage practices for sugar beet production, based on increased activity of spiders, centipedes and rove beetles. Although prey consumption remained unaffected by the tillage system used, increased weed seed consumption was observed under the zone tillage system. This study also illustrated the importance of examining important beneficial taxa, such as ground beetles, on the species level rather than on the family level, based on their differing responses to tillage by different species. ...|$|R

25|$|Dispersal {{creates a}} {{relatively}} high mortality rate for sugarbeet <b>root</b> <b>aphids.</b> Additionally, alate aphids incur other disadvantages: if aphids fly then they may incur an additional cost in that their potential fecundity is further reduced {{and there is a}} further delay in the onset of reproduction.

Although dispersal results in the colonization of suitable plants, it is not always clear what advantages there are in dispersing except from annual plants that are about to die. As dispersal can be costly in terms of fecundity or survival, or both, then sugarbeet <b>root</b> <b>aphids</b> are likely to delay departure until host quality falls below the average expectation for the habitat.|$|R

40|$|Pemphigus betae Doane (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is a {{sporadic}} pest {{of sugar}} beet (Beta vulgaris L. var. vulgaris) in all major sugar beet production regions of North America. These oval-shaped, pale-yellowish insects, {{with a body}} length ranging from 1. 9 – 2. 4 mm, secrete a waxy material, giving their subterranean colonies a moldy appearance. Poplars in the genus Populus L. are the preferred primary hosts, while sugar beet and certain weed species, such as common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) and kochia (Kochia scoparia (L.)), are among the secondary hosts. Pemphigus betae has a complex and varied life cycle and is usually heteroecious and holocyclic, although anholocyclic apterae are known to overwinter in the soil. Heavy infestations of this aphid can induce significant reductions in yield, sugar content, and recoverable sugar. Under conditions of extreme stress and heavy infestations, the alienicolae can induce stunting, chlorosis, wilting, and even death of sugar beet plants. Accurately establishing population densities for sugarbeet <b>root</b> <b>aphids</b> presents a challenge, because the economic important stage of this insect is subterranean. However, use of a fall root rating index aids in estimating relative population densities. Furthermore, <b>root</b> <b>aphids</b> are especially difficult to control by means of conventional insecticides.

The objectives of this study were to quantify the effects of temperature on development, longevity, fecundity, and population growth of T. nigriabdominalis and to assess the effects of host plant on development of T. nigriabdominalis. The effects of temperature on performance of this <b>root</b> <b>aphid</b> were determined at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 +/- 1 degrees C on rice roots, Oryza sativa L. Nymphal stages from birth to adult decreased from 46. 3 d at 10 degrees C to 8. 5 d at 30 degrees C. Aphid survival and development were lowest at 35 degrees C, and no aphid produced progeny at this temperature. Average adult longevity decreased from 23. 3 d at 15 degrees C to 8. 2 d at temperatures up to 35 degrees C. Average number of nymphs produced per female was highest at 26 degrees C; averaging near 30 nymphs per female, but it dropped to near zero at both 10 and 35 degrees C. The highest intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) was 0. 241 at 30 degrees C. Net reproductive rate (R- 0) ranged from 29. 8 at 25 degrees C to 0. 2 at 10 degrees C. The generation time (GT) decreased with increasing temperatures from 60. 3 d at 10 degrees C to 13. 8 d at 30 degrees C. In addition, <b>root</b> <b>aphids</b> reared at 30 degrees C on three host plants [O. sativa, Zea mays L. and Sorghum bicolor (L.)
