40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 22 - 25, 1984 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaThe DoD is {{focusing}} considerable attention on interoperability <b>and</b> <b>internetting</b> as {{effective means of}} increasing the survivability of space systems. The tracking stations of the various DoD space systems are prime candidates for interoperability <b>and</b> <b>internetting</b> enhancements for two reasons: (1) {{a belief that the}} “front ends” of the various ground command and control segments is where the greatest commonality of functions should already exist; and (2) the knowledge of the large existing DoD capital investment in tracking station assets. This paper provides a method for examining the similarities and commonalities among tracking stations and for identifying incompatibilities and differences which, if eliminated, would facilitate interoperability <b>and</b> <b>internetting</b> <b>and,</b> hence, improve the survivability of DoD space systems...|$|R
