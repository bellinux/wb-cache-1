25|$|When {{a law of}} Torah {{conflicts}} with morality, when the law is 'unpleasant', {{we are committed to}} finding a way to address the problem. As a halakhic movement we look to precedent to find the tools with which to shape the Torah. For the most part, we rely on the strategies of old. At the same time, we <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> explicitly what was largely implicit in the past, namely, to make changes on moral grounds.|$|E
25|$|Others contest these conclusions, {{stating that}} family courts are biased {{in favor of}} fathers and that the lower {{percentage}} of separated fathers as custodial parents {{is a result of}} choices made by fathers rather than bias of family courts. According to sociologist Michael Flood, father's rights activists have exaggerated the disparity in custody awards between mothers and fathers, and ignored {{the fact that in the}} vast majority of cases, fathers voluntarily relinquish custody of their children through private arrangements; either because they <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, or because they do not expect a favorable court ruling.|$|E

25|$|Contraception can be effective, but {{may also}} have health repercussions and can be {{difficult}} (or even impossible) to reverse in some animals. Additionally, some species may lose their reproductive capability entirely if prevented from breeding for a period (whether through contraceptives or isolation), but further study is needed on the subject. Sale of surplus animals from zoos was once common {{and in some cases}} animals have ended up in substandard facilities. In recent decades the practice of selling animals from certified zoos has declined. A large number of animals are culled each year in zoos, but this is controversial. A highly publicized culling as part of population management was that of a healthy giraffe at Copenhagen Zoo in 2014. The zoo argued that its genes already were well-represented in captivity, making the giraffe unsuitable for future breeding. There were offers to adopt it and an online petition to save it had many thousand signatories, but the culling proceeded. Although zoos in some countries have been open about culling, the controversy of the subject and pressure from the public has resulted in others being closed. This stands in contrast to most zoos publicly announcing animal births. Furthermore, while many zoos are willing to cull smaller and/or low-profile animals, fewer <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it with larger high-profile species.|$|E
25|$|Government {{marriage}} {{officers who}} have an objection of conscience to solemnising same-sex marriages may note this objection in writing to the Minister of Home Affairs, {{and if they do}} so they cannot be compelled to solemnise same-sex marriages. (This provision does not apply to religious marriage officers because they are in any case not obliged to solemnise a marriage that would violate the doctrines of their religion.) Several constitutional scholars have argued that this provision is unconstitutional, representing as it does state-sanctioned discrimination in violation of the right to equality. In September 2016, almost a decade after same-sex marriage was legalized in South Africa, the Department of Home Affairs released a list of marriage offices across the country that are willing to solemnise same-sex marriages. According to the list, of the 409 marriage offices only 117 (or 28.6%) <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. In Gauteng, 17 out of 57 offices said they would conduct same-sex marriages, 10 out of 59 in the Eastern Cape, 5 out of 28 in the Free State, 10 out of 58 in Mpumalanga, 16 out of 61 in Limpopo, 10 out of 34 in the Western Cape, 9 out of 22 in the Northern Cape, 29 out of 68 in KwaZulu-Natal and 10 out of 22 in North West. Following its release, Minister of Home Affairs Malusi Gigaba said the list {{was just one of the}} strategies that the Department had undertaken to resolve the issue, which include increasing sensitisation of Home Affairs officials and ensuring that LGBT people are treated respectfully and according to policies and laws by staff.|$|E

2500|$|In 2016, {{the group}} {{embarked}} across Europe and Asia on the Queen + Adam Lambert 2016 Summer Festival Tour. This included closing the Isle of Wight Festival in England on 12 June where they performed [...] "Who Wants to Live Forever" [...] {{as a tribute}} to the victims of the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida earlier that day. On 12 September they performed at the Park Hayarkon in Tel-Aviv, Israel {{for the first time in}} front of 58,000 people.

2500|$|In March 2014, a new zombie webisode {{series was}} announced. Digital {{producer}} Ric Forster pitched {{the idea of}} a zombie series featuring past characters in 2013. Upon learning about Screen Australia's Skip Ahead programme, which gives help with funding and resources, Forster contacted YouTube vlogger Louna Maroun to join the project. Maroun commented [...] "There's a huge fanbase for the zombie genre. It's so fresh and amazing that FremantleMedia <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this sort of thing. It's just a fan dream." [...] Forster wanted Neighbours: Zombies on Ramsay Street to be different from Neighbours, and said the visuals would reflect the dark nature of the story. Scenes were shot in both interior and external locations. An abandoned hospital and Kennedy bedroom sets were specially created for the series. Maroun appears at Hope Gottlieb, a past character who previously appeared in the show as a young child. The storyline sees Hope teaming up with Mason Turner (Taylor Glockner) to try and stop a zombie invasion.|$|E
