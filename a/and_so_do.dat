5|$|Maggots {{found on}} corpses are useful to {{forensic}} entomologists. Maggot species {{can be identified}} by their anatomical features and by matching their DNA. Maggots of different species of flies visit corpses and carcases at fairly well-defined times {{after the death of}} the victim, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>do</b> their predators, such as beetles in the family Histeridae. Thus, {{the presence or absence of}} particular species provides evidence for the time since death, and sometimes other details such as the place of death, when species are confined to particular habitats such as woodland.|$|E
5|$|The problem {{posed by}} the ratio is that the {{multiple}} specimens studied, died in the same place, but probably not in a sudden mass-death <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>do</b> not represent a single herd or contemporary population. The results may have been distorted by a greater chance for robust animals of getting fossilised or discovered. In an earlier study by Galton in 1982, {{it was suggested that}} individual difference in the sacral rib count of both Kentrosaurus and Dacentrurus might be an indication of dimorphism: females would have had an extra pair of sacral ribs, having also the first sacral vertebra connected to the ilium, in addition to the subsequent four sacrals.|$|E

25|$|Convulsions from GHB can {{be treated}} with the benzodiazepines {{diazepam}} or lorazepam.

25|$|Zoophilia {{may reflect}} {{childhood}} experimentation, sexual abuse {{or lack of}} other avenues of sexual expression.

25|$|Predators of Cape cobras {{include the}} honey badger (ratel).

25|$|These {{resource}} percentages are {{the ones}} which were in use back in 2001, before the 2002 revision, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>do</b> not match the currently used percentages for the Standard Edition, which are slightly different. Also, the formula for Zimbabwe's par score comes from the Standard Edition of D/L, which was used at the time. Currently the Professional Edition is used, which has a different formula when R2>R1. The formula required Zimbabwe to match West Indies' performance with their overlapping 89.8% of resource (i.e. score 235 runs), and achieve average performance with their extra 97.4% minus& 89.8% = 7.6% of resource (i.e. score 7.6% of G50 (225 at the time) = 17.1 runs).|$|E
25|$|Research {{is fairly}} {{consistent}} in {{the finding that}} species with concealed estrus mate at all stages of their ovarian cycle. For instance, mating activity in assamese macaques (Macaca assamensis) has been investigated. The researchers analysed the levels of progesterone in the monkeys, {{in order to establish}} the ovarian stage of the female, as progesterone peaks following the fertile window. They found that the females concealed estrus and were sexually receptive during the entire mating season. Concealed estrus and sexual receptivity (at all times of the ovarian cycle) aids paternity confusion. This is because the males are unsure of who mated with the female during her fertile period, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>do</b> not know the identity of the father.|$|E
25|$|Schottky diodes are {{constructed}} from a metal to semiconductor contact. They {{have a lower}} forward voltage drop than p–n junction diodes. Their forward voltage drop at forward currents of about 1mA is in the range 0.15V to 0.45V, which makes them useful in voltage clamping applications and prevention of transistor saturation. They {{can also be used}} as low loss rectifiers, although their reverse leakage current is in general higher than that of other diodes. Schottky diodes are majority carrier devices <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>do</b> not suffer from minority carrier storage problems that slow down many other diodes—so they have a faster reverse recovery than p–n junction diodes. They also tend to have much lower junction capacitance than p–n diodes, which provides for high switching speeds and their use in high-speed circuitry and RF devices such as switched-mode power supply, mixers, and detectors.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} provide for priests who {{celebrate}} the Tridentine Mass, publishers have issued facsimiles or reprintings of old missals. There were two new printings of the 1962 Tridentine Missal in 2004: one, with the imprimatur of Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz of Lincoln, Nebraska, by Baronius Press {{in association with the}} Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter; the other by the Society of St. Pius X's publishing house, Angelus Press. There was a new printing of a facsimile 1962 Tridentine Altar Missal in 2008 by PCP books. Some other missals reproduced date from before 1955 <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>do</b> not have the revised Holy Week rites promulgated by Pope Pius XII. They are used by traditionalists who reject Pius XII's liturgical changes. As well as such altar missals for use by the priest, old hand missals for those attending Mass have been reproduced, including a St Bonaventure Press facsimile of a pre-1955 edition of the St Andrew's Missal.|$|E
25|$|The House of Bourbon, in its {{surviving}} branches, {{is believed}} to be the oldest royal dynasty of Europe (and the oldest documented European family altogether) that is still existing in the direct male line today: The House of Capet's male ancestors, the Robertians, go back to Robert of Hesbaye (d. 807) as their first secured ancestor and he {{is believed to}} be a direct male descendant of Charibert de Haspengau (c. 555–636). Should this be true, only the Imperial House of Japan would outmatch the Bourbon's age, being reliably documented - as a ruling house already - from about 540. The House of Hesse traces its line back to 841, the House of Welf-Este and the House of Wettin are both emerging in the 10th century (<b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>do</b> some Italian non-ruling houses like the Caetani or the Massimo family), whereas most of the other ruling families of Europe only turn up to the light of history after the year 1000.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the L-39 {{anti-tank}} rifle, {{weapons in}} the 20 ItK 40 VKT are designed for full-automatic fire <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>do</b> not suffer from the similar structural weaknesses as the full-automatic conversion L-39/44 anti-aircraft rifles. The rate of fire for the gun is adjustable, with a maximum cyclic rate of 2x700 rounds per minute, and a more commonly used rate of 2x360 rounds per minute. The gun is loaded from 20 round magazines, with an empty weight of 5.6kg and 11–12kg full, {{depending on the type}} of ammunition. The 20x138B Long Solothurn cartridge used in 20 ItK 40 VKT was also used in the L-39 anti-tank rifle as well as the other 20mm anti-aircraft guns, the 20 ITK 30 and 20 ITK 35, used by field army units. The gun sight, designed by Osmo Niskanen and manufactured by Strömberg company, was not entirely satisfactory and was more complicated to use than the sight in the German 20 ITK 30. The gun trailer was also problematic, as it was rather frail and offered a ground clearance of only 20cm. Thus the towing speed was limited to 30–40km/h and the mobility of the gun was limited. Equipment used with the gun included spare magazines with a transport case, gun tarpaulin, a transport case for the gun sight and a toolkit.|$|E
