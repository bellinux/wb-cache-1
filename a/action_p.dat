[120] Mr. Marsh in his {{interesting}} work entitled The Earth as Modified by Human <b>Action</b> (<b>p.</b> 51), thus {{remarks on}} the effect of browsing quadrupeds in destroying and checking woody vegetation.--"I am convinced that forests would soon cover many parts of the Arabian and African deserts if man and domestic animals, especially the goat and the camel, were banished from them. The hard palate and tongue, and strong teeth and jaws of this latter quadruped enable him to break off and masticate tough and thorny branches as large as the finger. He is particularly fond of the smaller twigs, leaves, and seed-pods of the Sont and other acacias, which, like the American robinia, thrive well on dry and sandy soils, and he spares no tree the branches of which are within his reach, except, if I remember right, the tamarisk that produces manna. Young trees sprout plentifully around the springs and along the winter water-courses of the desert, and these are just the halting stations of the caravans and their routes of travel. In the shade of these trees annual grasses and perennial shrubs shoot up, but are mown down by the hungry cattle of the Bedouin as fast as they grow. A few years of undisturbed vegetation would suffice to cover such points with groves, and these would gradually extend themselves over soils where now scarcely any green thing but the bitter colocynth and the poisonous foxglove is ever seen." ...|$|E

In the interest of more fitting and separable labeling, the theoretical approach of this book is designated as social cognitive theory.

The District Court's {{denial of}} {{qualified}} immunity, {{to the extent}} it turned on a question of law, is an appealable [...] "final decision" [...] {{within the meaning of}} 28 U.S.C. § 1291 notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment. Qualified immunity, similar to absolute immunity, is an entitlement not to stand trial under certain circumstances. Such entitlement is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability; and like absolute immunity, it is effectively lot if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial. Accordingly, the reasoning that underlies the immediate appealability of the denial of absolute immunity indicates that the denial of qualified immunity should be similarly appealable under the [...] "collateral order" [...] doctrine; in each case, the district court's decision is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. The denial of qualified immunity also meets the additional criteria for an appealable interlocutory order: it conclusively determines the disputed question, and it involves a claim of rights separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the <b>action.</b> <b>P</b> P. 524-530.|$|E

In a broadly decision-theoretic approach, also drawing on hypothetical thinking theory [Evans, J. St. B. T. (2007). Hypothetical thinking: Dual processes in reasoning and judgement.

40|$|Cortisol has a {{well-defined}} circadian rhythm. The {{aim of the}} study was to examine the effect of the morning rise in cortisol concentration on lipolysis in adipose tissue. Ten healthy subjects were studied on two occasions, and six of these were studied on three occasions. During the first two occasions, either a control or cortisol suppression study was performed by using metyrapone, and on the third occasion exogenous cortisol replacement was given in addition to metyrapone. Lipolysis in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of the anterior abdominal wall was studied by measurement of arteriovenous differences. Reduction in the early morning rise in cortisol led to significantly decreased venoarterialized differences for nonesterified fatty acids (P < 0. 05) and glycerol (P < 0. 01), attributable in part to decreased hormone-sensitive lipase (EC 3. 1. 1. 3) <b>action</b> (<b>P</b> < 0. 05) in adipose tissue. At the same time the arterialized plasma triacylglycerol concentration increased (P < 0. 005) with a significant reduction in the adipose lipoprotein lipase (EC 3. 1. 1. 34) rate of <b>action</b> (<b>P</b> < 0. 05). In the replacement study, values were identical to those of the control study, showing that metyrapone had no nonspecific effects on lipolysis. We conclude that the morning rise in plasma cortisol concentration plays an important role in the regulation of lipolysis in adipose tissue in normal healthy adults...|$|E
