These effects of SNAP were prevented by pre-incubation with the NO scavenger 2 -(4 -carboxyphenyl) - 4, 4, 5, 5 -tetramethylimidazoline- 1 -oxyl- 3 -oxide (carboxy PTIO) or the guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1 H-[1, 2, 4]oxadiazolo[4, 3 -alpha]quinoxalin- 1 -one, and were mimicked by the membrane permeable cGMP analogue dibutyryl cGMP.

They affect virtually every step of the development of inflammation. Low concentrations <b>of</b> <b>nitric</b> oxide produced by constitutive and neuronal nitric oxide synthases inhibit adhesion molecule expression, cytokine and chemokine synthesis and leukocyte adhesion and transmigration.

Similarly superoxide anion produced by NAD(P) H oxidases present in all cell types participating in inflammation (leukocytes, endothelial and other vascular cells etc) may lead to toxic effects, when produced at high levels during oxidative burst, but may also modulate inflammation in a far more discrete way, when continuously produced at low levels b...|$|R

We have studied pyramidal neurons in slices of rat ventral subiculum {{to determine if there}} is a correlation between nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) activity and electrophysiological phenotype. The majority of NADPH-d-positive pyramidal neurons were found in the superficial cell layer (i. e. nearest to the hippocampal fissure) of the subiculum and appreciable NADPH-d activity was absent from pyramidal neurons in area CA 1. This distribution of NADPH-d activity was mimicked by that of immunoreactivity for the neuronal isoform <b>of</b> <b>nitric</b> oxide synthase. Subicular pyramidal neurons were classified, electrophysiologically, as intrinsically burst-firing or regular spiking. After electrophysiological characterization, neurons were filled with Neurobiotin and revealed using fluorescence immunocytochemistry. The slices containing these neurons were also processed for NADPH-d. NADPH-d activity was found in six out of eight regular spiking neurons but was not found in any of 13 intrinsically burst-firing neurons (P= 0. 0008, Fisher's Exact Test). We conclude that in rat ventral subiculum, NADPH-d activity is present in a proportion of pyramidal neurons and indicates the presence of the neuronal isoform <b>of</b> <b>nitric</b> oxide synthase. Furthermore, amongst pyramidal neurons, NADPH-d activity is distributed preferentially to those with the regular spiking phenotype.

40|$|The cardioprotective <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> <b>nitric</b> oxide (NO) {{have largely}} been {{attributed}} to cGMP.

We tested {{the hypothesis that the}} NO donor sodium nitroprusside specifically protects isolated cardiomyocytes from injury at least in part independently of its ability to elevate cGMP by using metabolic inhibition to simulate ischemia. Metabolic inhibition-induced injury of adult rat cardiomyocytes (increased activity of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase) was significantly reduced by sodium nitroprusside by at least 30 % at all concentrations studied (0. 3 - 100 ?M). Sodium nitroprusside (1 ?M) increased cardiomyocyte cGMP content, but neither a stable analogue of cGMP (8 -bromo-cGMP) nor a potent cGMP stimulus (atrial natriuretic peptide) mimicked the protective effects of sodium nitroprusside. Moreover, inhibition of soluble guanylyl cyclase failed to inhibit sodium nitroprusside cardiomyocyte protection. Conversely, inhibition of either ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels with glibenclamide (10 ?M) or calcium-sensitive potassium (KCa) channels with tetraethylammonium bromide (1 mM) or iberiotoxin (20 nM) markedly attenuated the cardioprotective <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> sodium nitroprusside.

Pretreatment with indomethacin precluded the involvement of endogenous prostaglandins in the protective effects of these agents. The protective effects of NO were transient, since a delay of 5 minutes between NO administration and ethanol administration resulted in a complete loss of the protective activity. The protection against ethanol afforded by 10 micrograms/ml nitroprusside could be completely reversed by intravenous infusion of either 1 % methylene blue or 1 mM hemoglobin, both of which inhibit vasodilation induced by nitric oxide.

Methods: Dog and monkey cerebral artery strips with and without endothelium were immersed for isometric tension recording in modified Ringer-Locke solution aerated with 95 % oxygen and 5 % carbon dioxide. Results: NG-nitro-L-arginine, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, produced concentration-related contrac-tion that was greater in the strips with intact endothelium than in those denuded of endothelium.
