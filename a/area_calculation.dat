After myometrium showed spontaneous contractions, the contractions were regulated by injecting 0. 1 mM oxytocin. Then, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 µmol danofloxacine was added to isolated organ bath in 10 min intervals, and frequency, peak amplitude and peak <b>area</b> <b>calculations</b> were recorded. With oxytocin supplementation, frequency, peak amplitude and peak <b>area</b> <b>calculations</b> were determined as 6. 7 ± 1. 0, 1874 ± 107, 1749 ± 68, respectively. With danofloxacine supplementation, frequency and peak amplitude first increased then slowed down in relation to the dose and the peak area decreased in relation to the dose (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, by adding danofloxacine to the media after contractions caused by an oxytocin treatment, we observed biphasic activity. The effects of danofloxacine high doses (40 and 80 µmol) may inhibit both K+ channels and the intracellular-induced mechanism...|$|R

5000|$|The {{voltage pulse}} {{produced}} by the detector (or by the photomultiplier in a scintillation counter) is shaped by a multichannel analyzer (MCA). The multichannel analyzer takes the very small voltage signal {{produced by the}} detector, reshapes it into a Gaussian or trapezoidal shape, and converts that signal into a digital signal. In some systems, the analog-to-digital conversion is performed before the peak is reshaped. The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) also sorts the pulses by their height. ADCs have specific numbers of [...] "bins" [...] into which the pulses can be sorted; these bins represent the channels in the spectrum. The number of channels can be changed in most modern gamma spectroscopy systems by modifying software or hardware settings. The number of channels is typically a power of two; common values include 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, or 16384 channels. The choice of number of channels depends on {{the resolution of the}} system and the energy range being studied.The multichannel analyzer output is sent to a computer, which stores, displays, and analyzes the data.
