5|$|Cameroon's natural {{resources}} {{are very well}} suited to agriculture and <b>arboriculture.</b> An estimated 70% of the population farms, and agriculture comprised an estimated 19.8% of GDP in 2009. Most agriculture is done at the subsistence scale by local farmers using simple tools. They sell their surplus produce, and some maintain separate fields for commercial use. Urban centres are particularly reliant on peasant agriculture for their foodstuffs. Soils and climate on the coast encourage extensive commercial cultivation of bananas, cocoa, oil palms, rubber, and tea. Inland on the South Cameroon Plateau, cash crops include coffee, sugar, and tobacco. Coffee is a major cash crop in the western highlands, and in the north, natural conditions favour crops such as cotton, groundnuts, and rice. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Cameroon vulnerable to shifts in their prices.|$|E

25|$|Ronald W. Clark, in his 1984 {{biography}} of Darwin, commented that Only the transparent honesty of Darwin's character... {{makes it possible}} to believe that by the 1850s he had no recollection of Matthew's work.

25|$|In {{the opinion}} of the author of his {{biography}} in the eleventh edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica, next to the Diary Evelyn's most valuable work is Sylva. Evelyn believed that the country was being rapidly depleted of wood by industries such as glass factories and iron furnaces, while no attempt was being made to replace the damage by planting. Evelyn put in a plea for afforestation, and besides producing a valuable work on <b>arboriculture,</b> he was able to assert in his preface to the king that he had really induced landowners to plant many millions of trees.|$|E
25|$|Excavations {{indicate}} that from {{early in the}} Middle Preclassic the community was large enough to produce heavy refuse deposits. Cotton was grown as well as maize; palaeobotanical research also has identified annonas, avocados, cacao, black beans, palm nuts, plums, and sapodilla (zapote blanco). <b>Arboriculture</b> developed – with groves of crop trees grown in terraces down {{to the edges of}} great ravines. Specialists practiced loom-weaving and were expert potters. Large-scale workshops for obsidian tool-making were spread around the ancient city. Religious practices that would later be further developed throughout Mesoamerica were elaborating during the early Middle Preclassic at Kaminaljuyu, including the erection of mounds to serve as substructures for small shrines or funerary/administrative temples, the development of a complex pantheon of deities – probably based on some primordial mythology and cosmology of which the Popol Vuh represents a fragment – and euhemerism, an incensario and stela cult, and warfare to procure captives for royal sacrifice.|$|E

[...] Darwin implies that he discovered this work after the initial publication of the Origin.

500|$|A Finnish study {{published}} in 1997 found that bacterial communities under P.sylvestris without mycorrhizae metabolised organic and amino acids, while communities among S.bovinus metabolised mannitol, a sugar alcohol. The mycelia also extended the environment in the soil that the bacteria were able to grow in. An experimental study in Portugal showed that Pinus pinaster trees grew better after being inoculated with [...] mycelium from S.bovinus, Laccaria laccata and Lactarius deterrimus and spores of Pisolithus tinctorius and Scleroderma citrinum. These fungi were proposed as an alternative for chemical fertiliser in <b>arboriculture</b> of pine trees.

500|$|Initially {{following}} the fire, the tree's vicinity {{was closed for}} the investigation and for {{an assessment of the}} extent of damage and safety risk. On September27, 2007, the West Virginia Division of Forestry's urban forestry coordinator Bob Hannah and technical specialist Jennifer Brashears engaged in an inspection and evaluation of the tree to provide recommendations. In their report, Hannah and Brashears assessed that the tree's [...] "severe structural weakness" [...] was not caused by the fire, and instead highlighted the tree's [...] "size, age, and severity of defects" [...] as the cause of its instability. They did, however, assess that the fire may have caused further mortality of the tree's cambium. They used various measurements developed by the International Society of <b>Arboriculture</b> and the United States Forest Service to formulate a tree risk assessment. At the time of their investigation, the tree's diameter at breast height was , with 27% of the trunk consisting of open space. Hannah and Brashears also found that one-third of the lower trunk and root crown demonstrated callus formation and no new growth, but instead severe decay and peeling bark. Hannah and Brashears further determined that structural mitigation was not feasible, and that the Webster Sycamore was to be [...] "considered an extreme hazard" [...] and the public should be [...] "excluded from its striking zone through fencing and signage".|$|E

60|$|While {{we looked}} away and away, the {{gardener}} and a half-grown boy were about their labors that Sunday afternoon {{as if it}} were a week-day, though for that reason perhaps they were not working very hard. They seemed mostly to be sweeping up the fallen leaves from the paths, and where the leaves had not fallen from the horse-chestnuts the boy was assisting nature by climbing the trees and plucking them. We tried to find out why he was doing this, but to this day I do not know why he was doing it, and I must be content to contribute the bare fact to the science of <b>arboriculture.</b> Possibly it was in the interest of neatness, and was a precaution against letting the leaves drop and litter the grass. There was apparently a passion for neatness throughout, which in the villa itself mounted to ecstasy. It was in a state to be come and lived in at any moment, though I believe it was occupied only in the late spring and the early autumn; in winter the noble family went to Madrid, and in summer to some northern watering-place. It was rather small, and expressed a life of the minor hospitalities when the family was in residence. It was no place for house-parties, and scarcely for week-end visits, or even for neighborhood dinners. Perhaps on that terrace there was afternoon ice-cream or chocolate for friends who rode or drove over or out; it seemed so possible that we had to check in ourselves the cozy impulse to pull up our shell-covered cement chairs to some central table of like composition.|$|E
