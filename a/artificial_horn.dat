3000|$|There is {{evidence}} that horn deformation has been practiced by many ancient African ethnic groups. Many cattle skulls have been excavated from funerary bucranias (a set of cattle skulls place in or around a burial). Numerous cattle skulls placed in a croissant shape on the southern border of a tomb, in the eastern cemetery of the ancient (2500 to 1500  BC) city of Kerma (Honegger et al. 2009, Chaix et al. 2012), northern Sudan, revealed unnatural horn shapes, vertical parallel horns or one horn pointing downwards and the other upwards, suggesting that such shapes {{could only have been}} achieved by artificial means (Chaix 1996, 2001, 2004 a, 2004 b, 2006, Chaix and Hansen 2003). Such archeological findings were also discovered in burial areas closer to Egypt. Those in Faras (Hall 1962) suggested that such customs were also carried out by ancient Egyptians. This is confirmed by the representation of cattle with obvious <b>artificial</b> <b>horn</b> deformation on the East Wall reliefs of the tomb of Ptahhotep (Fig.  6 d) (Quibell 1896), on the south wall of the offering hall of Manofer in Saqqara (Egypt) from approximately 2500  BC (Altenmüller 2006), in the decorated chapels of the Meroitic Pyramid at Meroe (Chapman and Dunham 1952) and in many other Egyptian bas-reliefs (Vandier 1969). The practice of horn deformation by ancient Egyptians may suggest that they were responsible for introducing such a custom southwards to other African ethnic groups (Seligman 1932, Seligman and Seligman 1950). While such a hypothesis is attractive, it is probably not the case because horn deformation is not continuously and commonly represented in Egyptian tombs (Schwabe 1984), and furthermore, <b>artificial</b> <b>horn</b> shapes have appeared in the rock art of various Neolithic cultures of several Saharan regions, all substantially pre-dating Egyptian civilization (Huard 1959, Huard and Massip 1963, Chaix 2004 a, b, Searight 2004). For example, rock art of the Wadi Mathendous, in Libya, of approximately 7000 to 6000 BC, shows a similar technique used to maintain parallel vertical growth of the horns, the fractured horns being kept in the chosen position by a rope tied between the notched tips (Fig.  5 b), [...]...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} the primate {{auditory}} system should reflect the specialized functions that it evolved to carry out. One such function is conspecific vocal recognition. Measuring the neural selectivity to vocalizations {{is a way to}} identify the mechanisms underlying this auditory specialization. Previous studies examining call selectivity in the primate auditory cortex suffered from two drawbacks: an impoverished stimulus set and/or the use of anesthetized or passive-listening paradigms. We adopted a simple behavioural task to study how neurons in the rhesus monkey auditory cortex respond to conspecific vocalizations. Two monkeys were trained to listen to sound sequences composed of one or two conspecific vocalizations (mean SPL= 79. 9 dB) and an <b>artificial</b> <b>horn</b> sound (frequency bandwidth: 788 Hz- 11 kHz; 300 ms in duration; SPL= 69. 7 dB) presented in free-field. They were rewarded if they pulled a lever within 1 sec following the horn sound. Both monkeys were able to do this task at > 95 -correct performance levels. This task requires that the monkey attend in the auditory domain without the confounds of over-training on vocalizations and the response lability that occurs during passive-listening. Our stimuli consist of 3 exemplars from each of 7 call categories (coos, pant-threats, grunts, aggressive barks, shrill barks, noisy screams and harmonic arches). Using this paradigm, we are investigating whether the responses of auditory ‘belt’ cortical neurons reflect category-level selectivity to conspecific vocalizations...|$|E

Tommy Dreamer used {{a variation of the}} belt with a New York license plate as a centerplate, over a replica of a European Championship. The reason for these changes was because the original belt had become so damaged from wear and tear.|$|R
