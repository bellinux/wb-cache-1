40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} of the wireless Internet market and its structure is driven by differing industry fundamentals and the revenue derived from content and content-related services {{is expected to increase}} significantly for all actors within the wireless industry. Providing flexible and scalable <b>accounting</b> and <b>billing</b> systems will be essential for success when offering wireless services to end customers. The wireless service providers have difficulties in billing their customers due to their inability to associate customer transactions with network usage, correlate data from multiple sources and flexibly support the emerging billing models. In this paper an <b>accounting</b> and <b>billing</b> model for the two wireless services is presented. The evaluation of the services proved that the number of roles and partners in the wireless services is huge and that solutions like <b>accounting</b> agents and <b>billing</b> mediation servers are needed for tracking customer transactions and directing the <b>accounting</b> and <b>billing</b> between the partners...|$|R

At the request of this Committee, Senator Grassley, and Representative Schakowsky, GAO performed work to determine whether DOD controls were adequate to protect the centrally <b>billed</b> <b>accounts</b> from fraud, waste, and abuse. This testimony focuses on whether DOD (1) paid for airline tickets {{that it did not}} use and did not process for refund, (2) improperly reimbursed travelers for the cost of airline tickets paid for with centrally <b>billed</b> <b>accounts,</b> and (3) adequately secured access to centrally <b>billed</b> <b>accounts</b> against improper and fraudulent use. This testimony also addresses the internal control breakdowns that led to instances of fraud, waste, and abuse and DOD's corrective actions. In two companion reports issued today, DOD concurred with the 31 recommendations GAO made [...] including moving to a well- managed individually <b>billed</b> <b>account</b> program [...] to improve the management of unused tickets, recover the value of outstanding unused tickets, prevent and detect improper payments, reduce the risk that airline tickets are issued on invalid travel orders, and improve security over the centrally <b>billed</b> <b>accounts.</b> ...|$|R
