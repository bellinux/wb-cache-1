5|$|Their {{interaction}} {{system is}} principally sociological: {{the presence of}} the Penal Code article on slandering the state system inevitably results in sending <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> of citizens to forensic psychiatric examination. Thus, it is not psychiatry itself that is punitive, but the totalitarian state uses psychiatry for punitive purposes with ease.|$|E
5|$|During the 1906 {{legislative}} session, Beckham urged {{investigation and}} prosecution of corrupt insurance companies, {{following the lead of}} New York attorney Charles Evans Hughes. In particular, he recommended reducing the practice of deferred dividends, which allowed the insurance companies to keep large stores of cash on-hand for illegal purposes. He further advocated that insurance companies doing business in the state be required to invest <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> of their earnings in Kentucky, bolstering the its economy and providing policyholders some protection against fraud.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 2005, North Korea and South Korea held {{meetings}} {{to discuss the}} possibility of sending a united team to the 2008 Olympics. The proposal failed, because of disagreements about how athletes would be chosen; North Korea was demanding <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> representation for its athletes. A subsequent attempt to broker an agreement for the two nations to walk together during the March of Nations failed as well, despite their having done so during the 2000 and 2004 Games.|$|E
50|$|Recently, certain cities, counties, {{and states}} have {{implemented}} indoor smoking bans. In some jurisdictions, hookah businesses can be exempted from the policies through special permits. Some permits, however, have requirements {{such as the}} business earning <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> minimum <b>percentage</b> of their revenue from alcohol or tobacco.|$|R

5|$|According to the report, {{the average}} annual {{transfers}} from the national government to the municipalities for {{water supply and sanitation}} (including solid waste) were about US$278m between 1998 and 2001. 86% of that funding was allocated through the SGP as defined in Law 715. <b>A</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> of these resources was dedicated exclusively for water supply and sanitation. They mainly go to small municipalities that show low income levels. Nevertheless, many municipalities use funding through SGP dedicated for water supply and sanitation for other purposes.|$|E
25|$|Social unrest during 1920s led to {{a change}} in this policy. From then on, the colonial {{administration}} began a policy of positive discrimination by reserving <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> of government jobs for the lower castes.|$|E
25|$|For non-compulsory education, China {{adopts a}} shared-cost mechanism, {{charging}} tuition at <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> of the cost. Meanwhile, {{to ensure that}} students from low-income families have access to higher education, the government has initiated effective ways of assistance, with policies and measures as scholarships, work-study programs, subsidies for students with special economic difficulties, tuition reduction or exemption and state stipends.|$|E
50|$|The third option, Let's Taisen (extra=let's battle), is the {{multiplayer}} battle mode. A multiplayer {{battle is}} {{conducted in the}} same way as regular battles in the story mode, but winning <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> number of battles or maintaining <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> winning <b>percentage</b> awards the main character a special title that boosts their abilities. 3 elemental spirits (chosen randomly) also appear at the beginning of every multiplayer turn.|$|R
60|$|Not {{with these}} did Mary and Saxon belong. They knew them not, had no acquaintances among them. It {{did not matter}} whether the festival were Irish, German, or Slavonian; whether the picnic was the Bricklayers', the Brewers', or the Butchers'. They, the girls, were of the dancing crowd that swelled by <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> {{constant}} <b>percentage</b> the gate receipts of all the picnics.|$|R
50|$|The {{treatment}} for myocardial rupture is supportive {{in the immediate}} setting and surgical correction of the rupture, if feasible. <b>A</b> <b>certain</b> small <b>percentage</b> of individuals do not seek medical attention in the acute setting and survive to see the physician days or weeks later. In this setting, it may be reasonable to treat the rupture medically and delay or avoid surgery completely, depending on the individual's comorbid medical issues.|$|R
25|$|EU {{member states}} {{differ in the}} degree of worker {{involvement}} in corporate management. In Germany, most large corporations are required to allow employees to elect <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> of seats on the supervisory board.

25|$|The CRTC's Canadian content {{regulations}} {{dictate that}} <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> {{of a domestic}} broadcaster's transmission time must include content that is produced by Canadians, or covers Canadian subjects. These regulations also apply to US cable television channels such as MTV and the Discovery Channel, which have local versions of their channels available on Canadian cable networks. Similarly, BBC Canada, while showing primarily BBC shows from the United Kingdom, also carries Canadian output.|$|E
25|$|Both these {{arguments}} were {{strengthened by the}} greater urgency of winning the game, due to the former rule that the winning league attains home field advantage in the World Series. A number of compromises were suggested in the sports/news media as measures to mitigate these selection issues, including {{limiting the number of}} representatives a particular team could have; or requiring only that <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> of the 30 teams be represented; or expanding the size of the All-Star rosters.|$|E
50|$|A royalty {{trust is}} a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually {{involved}} in oil and gas production or mining. However, unlike most corporations, its profits are not taxed at the corporate level provided <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> high <b>percentage</b> (e.g. 90%) of profits are distributed to shareholders as dividends. The dividends are then taxed as personal income. This system, similar to real estate investment trusts, effectively avoids the double taxation of corporate income.|$|R
25|$|Network effects become {{significant}} after <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> subscription <b>percentage</b> {{has been}} achieved, called critical mass. At the critical mass point, the value {{obtained from the}} good or service is {{greater than or equal}} to the price paid for the good or service. As the value of the good is determined by the user base, this implies that after <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> number of people have subscribed to the service or purchased the good, additional people will subscribe to the service or purchase the good due to the value exceeding the price.|$|R
50|$|Property Management systems allow local {{property}} {{managers and}} maintenance personnel manage {{the day-to-day operations}} of their properties. Property maintenance for commercial properties includes major focus areas such as risk management, maintenance, communication, and tenant satisfaction. Usually <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> agreed <b>percentage</b> of the rent payment will be deducted on each rent payment collected by the property management as their service fee. There are also other ways of charging the property owners using the service but percentage collection is the common one.|$|R
25|$|Early {{resistors}} {{were made}} in more or less arbitrary round numbers; a series might have 100, 125, 150, 200, 300, etc. Resistors as manufactured are subject to <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> tolerance, and {{it makes sense to}} manufacture values that correlate with the tolerance, so that the actual value of a resistor overlaps slightly with its neighbors. Wider spacing leaves gaps; narrower spacing increases manufacturing and inventory costs to provide resistors that are more or less interchangeable.|$|E
25|$|Recent U.S. {{policy has}} {{generally}} been to provide an inflation-adjusted federal production tax credit (PTC) of $15 per MW·h (in 1995 dollars) generated for the first ten years of operation for wind energy sold. As of 2015, the credit was $23 per MW·h. Renewable portfolio standards mandating <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> of electric power sales come from renewable energy sources, which are in place in {{about half of the}} states, also have boosted the development of the wind industry.|$|E
25|$|For {{a limited}} period, <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> of new housing in any {{development}} {{has to be}} sold to bumiputra owners. Housing developers are required to provide a minimum 7% discount to bumiputra buyers of these lots. This is required regardless of the income level of the potential buyer. Remaining unsold houses after a given time period are allowed {{to be sold to}} non-bumi if the developer proves {{attempts have been made to}} fulfill the requirement. There is no bumiputra discount on existing housing.|$|E
50|$|The UP, {{among other}} minor parties {{that had been}} losing votes in recent years, {{formally}} lost its legal representative status as a political party (personería jurídica) in September 2002 after that year's national elections, due to the application of new electoral laws that conditioned such a status (or the regaining of the same) to either the signing of a petition with 50,000 signatures or to obtaining <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> minimum <b>percentage</b> of votes. Some UP members continue to identify themselves as such within the Social and Political Front.|$|R
50|$|Year-over-base caps {{allow the}} cap to raise {{each year by}} <b>a</b> <b>certain,</b> {{predetermined}} <b>percentage</b> of <b>a</b> pre-determined, initial (base) CAM charge. Year-over-year caps mean the percentage increase applies not to a base amount, but to the actual CAM charge of the previous year. Cumulative caps allow the yearly percentage increase of the CAM Cap to accumulate. Thus, a yearly 5% cap would grow the cap each year by 5%, so that the first year it was a 5% cap, the 2nd year a 10% cap, the third year 15, and so on. Compounded caps allow the yearly percentage increase of the CAM Cap to grow at a compounded rate each year.|$|R
5000|$|System Balancing and Exception Reporting : System {{balancing}} {{refers to}} built-in system checks {{to verify the}} integrity of data transferred from another application. Examples include a mechanism for comparing batch totals between an original data source and data transferred into a new application. Exception reporting relates to reporting of exception items to management so that more effective use of management time can be achieved. For example, the Sales Manager could potentially review all sales transactions for a day. But it is more time-efficient if the review and approval process is focused on transactions that are not sold at the list price, or sold above <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> pre-determined <b>percentage</b> of discount.|$|R
25|$|For a {{recycling}} program to work, having a large, stable supply of recyclable material is crucial. Three legislative options {{have been used}} to create such a supply: mandatory recycling collection, container deposit legislation, and refuse bans. Mandatory collection laws set recycling targets for cities to aim for, usually in the form that <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> of a material must be diverted from the city's waste stream by a target date. The city is then responsible for working to meet this target.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} began heavy military spending in 1940, and started drafting millions {{of young men}} that year. By 1945, 17 million had entered service to their country, {{but that was not}} enough to absorb all the unemployed. During the war, the government subsidized wages through cost-plus contracts. Government contractors were paid in full for their costs, plus <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> profit margin. That meant the more wages a person was paid the higher the company profits since the government would cover them plus a percentage.|$|E
25|$|Drift {{cars are}} usually light-to-moderate weight rear-wheel-drive coupes and sedans, {{offering}} a large {{range of power}} levels. There have also been all-wheel drive cars (AWD) that have been converted to rear-wheel drive such as Subaru WRX, Toyota Avensis as Scion tC, Mitsubishi EVO and Nissan GT-R. Early on AWD cars without conversion were allowed in some drifting competitions, usually the rules allowed only <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> of power {{to be sent to}} the front wheels, but are banned in most (if not all) drifting competitions today.|$|E
2500|$|The Glasflügel H-201 Standard Libelle proved immensely popular, {{but was not}} {{an optimal}} {{aircraft}} for club and rental use, due to its mid-wing and low tail which could both be damaged in off-airport landings. Also its small cockpit fits only <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> demographic <b>percentage</b> of soaring pilots. The company developed the 205 with the design goals of a simple, rugged aircraft that would withstand club and fixed-base operator rental use. The resulting aircraft has a high-wing and a T-tail to provide more obstacle clearance {{as well as a}} larger cockpit. To eliminate gear-up landings the monowheel landing gear is non-retractable, [...] although at least one Club Libelle exists (D-2468) which is equipped with retractable landing gear.|$|R
5000|$|The Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) is {{also the}} COP(or EER) {{expressed}} in BTU/W·hr, but instead of being evaluated at a single operating condition, it represents the expected overall performance for a typical year's weather in a given location. The SEER is thus calculated with the same indoor temperature, but over a range of outside temperatures from [...] to , with <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> specified <b>percentage</b> of time in each of 8 bins spanning 5 °F (2.8 °C). There is no allowance for different climates in this rating, which is intended to give {{an indication of how}} the EER is affected by a range of outside temperatures {{over the course of a}} cooling season.|$|R
40|$|In several {{parts of}} the world {{livestock}} animals (sheep, goats and cattle) are identified with radiofrequency identification (RFID) devices. These transponders can be read with handheld and stationary readers. The reading can be performed on the farm, during transport, in the sales yard and in the slaughterhouse. Especially when the RFID tags are read with a static reader the signal strength the transponders produce is very important (reading distance shall be sufficient if animal passes the reader). If the signal is insufficient it can result in misreads. In many countries RFID tags have to meet certain approval criteria to get allowance for use for identifying <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> species with those tags. The approval is mostly based upon tests that are performed by test agencies on new tags that the manufacturer has send to the test agency. The tags the manufacturer later on sell on the market can have a different quality as the original tested product or the quality of the RFID tags can be influenced by environmental conditions e. g. moisture. The reduced quality can increase the misread percentage. In the most RFID schemes there are no checks performed that safeguard the quality of the products sold on the marked. Schemes that monitor the quality of RFID products on the market could be introduced. This monitoring could e. g. be based upon RFID sample tags that are collected during slaughter. When <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentages</b> of the recovered tags are outside specification the manufacturer should improve the quality of his product. If the manufacturer e. g. within a year does not succeed {{to improve the quality of}} that product approval for that product could be withdrawn...|$|R
25|$|Both minimum {{recycled}} content mandates and utilization rates increase demand directly by forcing manufacturers to include recycling in their operations. Content mandates specify that <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> {{of a new}} product must consist of recycled material. Utilization rates are a more flexible option: industries are permitted to meet the recycling targets at any point of their operation or even contract recycling out in exchange for tradeable credits. Opponents to both of these methods point to the large increase in reporting requirements they impose, and claim that they rob industry of necessary flexibility.|$|E
25|$|Woodworking {{machinery}} that perform a similar function as hand planes include the jointer and the thickness planer, also called a thicknesser; the job these specialty power tools {{can still be}} done by hand planers and skilled manual labor {{as it was for}} many centuries. When rough lumber is reduced to dimensional lumber, a large electric motor or internal combustion engine will drive a thickness planer that removes <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> of excess wood to create a uniform, smooth surface on all four sides of the board and in specialty woods, may also plane the cut edges.|$|E
25|$|A better {{approach}} {{seemed to}} be to offer carrots instead of sticks. In the first place captains were given some leeway by allowing them <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>percentage</b> of missing troops, without consequences for their payment. Also, {{in some cases the}} nominal strength of companies was lowered intentionally, at the same time keeping the amount of payments constant, thereby giving the troops a pay rise in the bargain. But the best approach would be to have the government take over the entrepreneurial risks of the captain. However, this did only happen in the Republic in the reforms of William III after 1672.|$|E
40|$|An {{instrumentation}} {{and computer}} system which {{offers the potential}} for analyzing photogeographic distributions is described. To satisfy the requirement for computer acceptance, a television and waveform system was developed to transpose pictorial or iconic photo forms to the analytic. A video conversion was accomplished, and each pattern visible on the original photography was represented by <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> range of <b>percentages.</b> With spatial occurrences in digital form, a computer program was developed that could identify, analyze, and map geographic inputs...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of tolerance to cloxacillin and methicillin was studied in Staphylococcus aureus. It was {{demonstrated that the}} minimal bactericidal concentrations showed marked differences, depending on the method of detection used. These differences resulted from carry-over of the antibiotic to the subculture plates. When carry-over of the antibiotic was prevented {{by the addition of}} beta-lactamase to the nutrient medium, the antibiotics were no longer bactericidal. At <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> antibiotic concentration and at higher concentrations, however, each strain showed <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> survival <b>percentage</b> after 24 h. The tolerance percentage was determined for 15 strains. The values found for the individual strains ranged from less than 0. 1 to 11 % for cloxacillin and methicillin. since these percentages were reproducible within narrow limits, they could be regarded as a characteristic of the strains. The tolerance percentage was independent of the growth phase of the initial cultures...|$|R
25|$|Another {{institutional}} {{factor that}} may have an important effect is proportionality, i.e., how closely the legislature reflects {{the views of the}} populace. Under a pure proportional representation system the composition of the legislature is fully proportional to the votes of the populace and a voter can be sure that he will be represented in parliament, even if only from the opposition benches. (However many nations that utilise a form of proportional representation in elections depart from pure proportionality by stipulating that smaller parties are not supported by <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> threshold <b>percentage</b> of votes cast will be excluded from parliament.) By contrast, a voting system based on single seat constituencies (such as the plurality system used in North American, the UK and India) will tend to result in many non-competitive electoral districts, in which the outcome is seen by voters as a foregone conclusion.|$|R
