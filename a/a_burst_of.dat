5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} {{existed in the}} central Caribbean Sea in late October. It steadily organized, and was classified as Tropical Depression Fourteen on October 31. It moved northwestward, and entered a high-shear environment due to an upper level low situated toward the end of a high pressure system. By November 1, little convection remained as the weak depression turned to the north and crossed Cuba. <b>A</b> <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> convection organized over the depression, and brought strong wind gusts to the Florida Keys as it passed through the area on November 2. It continued to the north-northwest, paralleling the Florida west coast, and lost all of its convection on November 3. The system turned to the northeast, and merged with a weak extratropical low over northern Florida on November 4.|$|E
5|$|Although {{its surface}} {{circulation}} had dissipated, its circulation aloft remained intact {{and led to}} <b>a</b> <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> rainfall early on August 20. The 11.94inches/303.3mm that fell at Miller became the wettest Missouri rainfall total associated with a tropical cyclone, or its remains, since at least 1972. One person died in Sleeper when he drove into flood waters which had swept away a bridge he was attempting to navigate onto. Nine water rescues occurred along the I-44 corridor, mostly caused by Erin's rainfall. Damage totaled about $19.8million (2007USD) in the state, primarily in Polk County.|$|E

5|$|By August12, the NHC {{reported}} that Tropical Depression Two was near tropical storm intensity after <b>a</b> <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> deep convection over the center. At this point, {{the system was}} not upgraded to a tropical storm; however, in a post-storm analysis, {{it was determined that}} the system had attained tropical storm-force winds, peaking at 40mph (65km/h) for 12hours on August12. Several hours later, the system became disorganized due to increased wind shear. By the afternoon of August13, the system had weakened to a tropical depression and shortly thereafter, degenerated into a non-convective remnant low-pressure area as it failed to maintain convection around the center for 24hours. At this time, the NHC issued their final advisory on the system but noted that there was the possibility of regeneration.|$|E
5|$|By October 10, 2004, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} {{weather was}} situated well to the southwest of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Later that day, a surface low pressure system developed, and convection began to organize into slightly curved bands. The disturbance continued to in this manner, and at 1800 UTC on October 11, the low level circulation had become sufficiently organized to be designated as a tropical depression. At the time, the depression consisted of a well-defined circulation, with some deep thunderstorm activity. Despite weak steering currents, the system started what was initially {{thought to be a}} westward drift, though just a few hours later was found to be towards the northwest. A small cyclone, <b>a</b> <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> deep convection formed at around the same time, and was said could have produced tropical storm-force winds.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>a</b> <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> intense neutron and gamma {{radiation}} came {{directly from the}} fireball. Its lethal radius was , covering {{about half of the}} firestorm area. An estimated 30% of immediate fatalities were people who received lethal doses of this direct radiation, but died in the firestorm before their radiation injuries would have become apparent. Over 6,000 people survived the blast and fire, but died of radiation injuries. Among injured survivors, 30% had radiation injuries from which they recovered, but with a lifelong increase in cancer risk. To date, no radiation-related evidence of heritable diseases has been observed among the survivors' children.|$|E

5|$|Mercator {{now turned}} to the modern maps, as author but no longer engraver: the practicalities of {{production}} of maps and globes had been passed to his sons and grandsons. In 1585 he issued a collection of 51 maps covering France, the Low Countries and Germany. Other maps may have followed in good order had not the misfortunes of life intervened: his wife Barbara died in 1586 and his eldest son Arnold died the following year so that only Rumold and the sons of Arnold were left to carry forward his business. In addition, {{the time he had}} available for cartography was reduced by <b>a</b> <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> writing on philosophy and theology: a substantial written work on the Harmonisation of the Gospels as well as commentaries on the epistle of St. Paul and the book of Ezekiel.|$|E
5|$|Moving very little, the {{depression}} was disorganized due to continued shear, leaving {{the center of}} circulation west of the convective activity. By later in the morning hours of May27, the system began to show overall signs of organization, primarily related to <b>a</b> <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> convection in the eastern semicircle. At the same time, the center of circulation either reformed or began to move farther north, possibly north-northeast. Embedded within the steering currents of a ridge, most forecasts anticipated the storm would drift northward for several days, though some computer models predicted the storm would eventually move inland near Acapulco. At 1800UTC on May27, {{the depression}} organized into a tropical storm, and as such was named Aletta by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E
5|$|One area of {{paleontology}} {{that has}} {{seen a lot of}} activity during the 1980s, 1990s, and beyond is the study of the Cambrian explosion during which many of the various phyla of animals with their distinctive body plans first appear. The well-known Burgess Shale Cambrian fossil site was found in 1909 by Charles Doolittle Walcott, and another important site in Chengjiang China was found in 1912. However, new analysis in the 1980s by Harry B. Whittington, Derek Briggs, Simon Conway Morris and others sparked a renewed interest and <b>a</b> <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> activity including discovery of an important new fossil site, Sirius Passet, in Greenland, and the publication of a popular and controversial book, Wonderful Life by Stephen Jay Gould in 1989.|$|E

5|$|The Muhammad al-Durrah {{incident}} {{took place}} in the Gaza Strip on 30 September 2000, {{on the second day of}} the Second Intifada, during widespread rioting throughout the Palestinian territories. Jamal al-Durrah and his 12-year-old son, Muhammad, were filmed by Talal Abu Rahma, a Palestinian cameraman freelancing for France 2, as they were caught in crossfire between Israeli and Palestinian security forces. The footage shows the pair crouching behind a concrete cylinder, the boy crying and the father waving, then <b>a</b> <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> gunfire and dust, after which the boy is seen slumped across his father's legs.|$|E

Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the footage that shows Muhammad lift his hand from his face. This cut became the basis of much of the controversy over the film.|$|E
5|$|Uranium-235 was {{the first}} isotope that {{was found to be}} fissile. Other {{naturally}} occurring isotopes are fissionable, but not fissile. On bombardment with slow neutrons, its uranium-235 isotope will most of the time divide into two smaller nuclei, releasing nuclear binding energy and more neutrons. If too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, a nuclear chain reaction occurs that results in <b>a</b> <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> heat or (in special circumstances) an explosion. In a nuclear reactor, such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a neutron poison, absorbing some of the free neutrons. Such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor control rods (see nuclear reactor physics for a description of this process of reactor control).|$|E
