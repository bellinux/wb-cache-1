5|$|An <b>additional</b> <b>consideration</b> for Napoleon {{was that}} a French victory might cause French {{speaking}} sympathisers in Belgium to launch a friendly revolution.

5|$|Pathways was Bungie's fourth title (and third {{commercial}} title) {{after their}} previous game, Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete, sold around 2,500 copies. In {{the summer of}} 1992, Jones was living in dorms at the University of Chicago when he saw Wolfenstein 3D, a shooter game with three-dimensional (3D) graphics. Inspired, Jones created a rough 3D-graphics engine for the Mac that simulated walls with trapezoids and rectangles. Originally, Bungie intended Pathways to be a straightforward 3D version of Minotaur, but they quickly found that the top-down perspective of their previous game did not mesh with the 3D presentation. An <b>additional</b> <b>consideration</b> was that the developers {{wanted to create a}} game that did not rely on then-rare networks and modems, an issue in marketing Minotaur. The rest of 1992 was spent tweaking the graphics engine.|$|E

500|$|In 1932, the Bulgarian Navy {{conceived}} a plan {{to search}} for the wreck of UB-45 with the intent of raising it for restoration as a training vessel, or, at the very least, to recover the sunken U-boat's [...] deck gun. An <b>additional</b> <b>consideration</b> was the recovery of the remains of UB-45s crew. On 19 July 1934, after a two-year search, Bulgarian minesweepers discovered the location of the wreck, which was resting at position , near the then Bulgarian–Romanian border. UB-45s wreck was raised in an operation that cost several times less than the cost of a new 8.8-centimeter gun. The remains recovered were buried on 26 February 1936 in a Varna cemetery, after a procession through the town.|$|E
500|$|Based on the {{behavior}} of viruses and certain bacteria, the Flood were intended to be [...] "disgusting and nasty". The creatures were constructed from the corpses and bodies of former combatants, so the artists had to make sure the Flood soldiers were recognizable enough while changing their silhouette enough to differentiate them from the uninfected. Many concepts and ideas were discarded due to time constraints—initially, the Flood were intended to convert any species of the alien Covenant into soldiers. [...] "We didn't have the resources to make it happen," [...] McLees recalled, so they modified the game's fiction to suggest that some Covenant were too small or too frail to be combat troops. At one point, the ringworld Halo featured dinosaur-like terrestrial creatures, but these were dropped due to gameplay constraints. An <b>additional</b> <b>consideration</b> was that Bungie felt the presence of other native species would dilute the impact and surprise of the Flood.|$|E
500|$|Halo Legends had {{origins in}} the 2006 Marvel Comics tie-in, The Halo Graphic Novel; O'Connor said {{that the idea of}} an anime {{compilation}} existed for years before there was momentum for the project. Wanting to tell smaller stories in a different format than video games and novels and in different art styles, O'Connor said that anime was a natural fit. An <b>additional</b> <b>consideration</b> was that 343 Industries felt that the Japanese style of narrative fit the stories well. Most of the animation studios Microsoft approached were available for the project. Most studios were [...] "afraid" [...] of creating their own stories, even if they were familiar with the series, so O'Connor sent them possible story treatments. Microsoft was deeply involved in making sure story details were correct and writing the scripts for the stories—O'Connor estimated that 50% of the dialogue in the final products were verbatim from the original scripts. While all the stories save one are considered canon, O'Connor noted that some discrepancies were the cause of artistic interpretation.|$|E

500|$|In October 2006, Sam Roberts, the Guerilla Gamemaker Competition {{director}} of the Slamdance festival, emailed Ledonne encouraging him to submit the game to the contest. Ledonne looked at {{the selection of the}} game as one of the competition's finalists in December as evidence that [...] "all forms of art can be valid tools for societal exploration (even painful topics like school shootings)". The event's organizer, Peter Baxter, announced the removal of the game from the festival's [...] "Guerrilla Gamemaker Competition" [...] after its selection as a finalist. Several reasons for the change of mind were given, including threatened sponsor withdrawal, possible lawsuits, and [...] "moral grounds"; Baxter denied that sponsor pressure caused the drop, instead affirming that [...] "the shootings are still a very touchy subject, and rightly so. We have to be sensitive to [...] feelings." [...] An <b>additional</b> <b>consideration</b> reported was that unnamed parties might sue for copyright violations in the game itself. The announcement marked the first time the festival had pulled jury-selected content from the contest; the incident was dubbed [...] "Slamgate" [...] by the gaming press.|$|E
500|$|Because of its {{previous}} {{contributions to the}} series—Halo 2s Blastacular and Halo: Reachs Defiant map pack—Certain Affinity was approached by 343 Industries to streamline the multiplayer maps to take Halo: Reachs gameplay options into account. The multiplayer is powered by the Halo: Reach engine. 343 Industries director Frank O'Connor said {{that the decision to}} use Reach for the multiplayer was controversial, even within the studio. [...] "In Halos day, there was never a proper networking mode," [...] O'Connor explained. [...] "We couldn't roll back the technology; [...] just wouldn't have worked with things like latency and all other modern Xbox Live-related problems. So we would have had to build it from scratch, and it still wouldn't have been the experience [...] remember." [...] An <b>additional</b> <b>consideration</b> O'Connor mentioned was that producing a full replication of Combat Evolveds multiplayer would have divided the Halo player base and interrupted Reachs lifespan. In choosing which seven Halo maps to remake, 343 Industries set a number of rules—the map could not have been previously remade for a 360-era Halo title, it had to work with Reachs gameplay sandbox, and {{it had to be a}} fan favorite. The company retained the same art director between the campaign and multiplayer elements of Anniversary to make sure the two halves of the game looked visually cohesive.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the combat}} system, the team took the systems used in Nier and infused {{elements}} from other titles by PlatinumGames. Taura's main concept {{was that the}} combat system improve on the original and weave into the story. An <b>additional</b> <b>consideration</b> was the inclusion of mechanics that would allow both casual and hardcore action gamers to enjoy playing. It was also the studio's first attempt at an open world game: while their previous titles had used a story-driven linear structure, Nier: Automata boasted large environments linked by seamless transitions. A particular element noted by Negishi was the lower concentration of enemies in the world compared to that usually found in their other titles, as the open nature of the game required this. This was part of their efforts to fulfill Yoko's creative vision: by including less enemies, the team gave players the opportunity to [...] "enjoy the still beauty of the game's desolate world". Required inclusions were the shooting elements, compared by staff to bullet hell titles, and combat which switched between top and side camera views.|$|E

2500|$|MP3 CD/DVD players: Portable CD {{players that}} can decode and play MP3 audio files stored on CDs. Such players were {{typically}} {{a less expensive}} alternative than either the hard drive or flash-based players when the first units of these were released. The blank CD-R media they use is very inexpensive, typically costing less than US$0.15 per disc. These devices have the feature {{of being able to}} play standard [...] "Red book" [...] CD-DA audio CDs. A disadvantage is that due to the low rotational disk speed of these devices, they are even more susceptible to skipping or other misreads of the file if they are subjected to uneven acceleration (shaking) during playback. [...] The mechanics of the player itself however can be quite sturdy, and are generally not as prone to permanent damage due to being dropped as hard drive-based players. Since a CD can typically hold only around 700 megabytes of data a large library will require multiple disks to contain. However, some higher-end units are also capable of reading and playing back files stored on larger capacity DVD; some also have the ability to play back and display video content, such as movies. An <b>additional</b> <b>consideration</b> can be the relatively large width of these devices, since they {{have to be able to}} fit a CD.|$|E

6000|$|For this reason, I should {{abstain from}} {{mentioning}} the curious clock in Lyons Cathedral, {{if it were}} not for a small mistake I made, in connection with that piece of mechanism.

Meanwhile, the Sacristan stood explaining these wonders, and pointing them out, severally, with a wand. There was a centre puppet of the Virgin Mary; and close to her, a small pigeon-hole, out of which another and a very ill-looking puppet made one of the most sudden plunges I ever saw accomplished: instantly flopping back again at sight of her, and banging his little door violently after him. Taking this to be emblematic of the victory over Sin and Death, and not at all unwilling to show that I perfectly understood the subject, in anticipation of the showman, I rashly said, 'Aha! The Evil Spirit. To be sure. He is very soon disposed of.' 'Pardon, Monsieur,' said the Sacristan, with a polite motion of his hand towards the little door, as if introducing somebody--'The Angel Gabriel!' ...|$|E
