40|$|Exploitation of {{knowledge}} of the efficiency of stabilizers on acrylonitrile-butadiene- styrene stability {{is very important for}} appropriate selection of stabilized systems. With the aim of studying the influence of testing conditions on the effectiveness of stabilizers, several compositions were prepared by extrusion and submitted to different weathering conditions. UV/Vis spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatography were used to assess the durability of stabilizers during the exposure time. Different behaviour was found under natural and accelerated weathering. Although all stabilizers induced a decrease of ABS degradation rate during accelerated weathering, the best results were achieved when combinations of light stabilizers with phenolic antioxidants and trivalent organo phosphorus compounds were used. Natural exposure enhances the degradation process when compared to data obtained in an <b>accelerated</b> <b>chamber</b> under similar light source characteristics. This behaviour suggests that there are other atmospheric parameters that {{play an important role in}} the degradation process. The results also showed that a combination of stabilizers and antioxidants induces a decrease of the oxidation rate in the initial stage of degradation under natural weath- ering conditions. Nevertheless, this synergetic effect is limited for the degradation time studied.

No campo observou-se predominância de trevo (Oxalis sp), picão-branco (Galinsoga parviflora Cav.) e tiririca (Cyperus rotundus L.). Trifuralin, fluorodifen e pendimenthalin fo-ram os herbicidas da maior eficiência no controle do trevo, enquanto para tiririca o tratamento com nitralin não diferiu da testemunha capinada, e para o picão-branco, o tratamento com pendimethalin controlou totalmente esta planta daninha. Para a produção de sementes de amendoim, não houve diferenças entre os tratamentos. A produção de casca e a produção de amendoim com casca, o tratamento com fluorodifen diferiu apenas da testemunha sem capina, suplantando-a.

50|$|There {{are many}} {{processes}} that are significant. The source of energy is the burning propellant. It generates hot gases that raise the chamber pressure. That pressure pushes {{on the base of}} the projectile, and causes the projectile to <b>accelerate.</b> The <b>chamber</b> pressure depends on many factors. The amount of propellant that has burned, the temperature of the gases, and the volume of the chamber. The burn rate of the propellant depends not only on the chemical make up, but also on the shape of the propellant grains. The temperature depends not only on the energy released, but also the heat lost to the sides of the barrel and chamber. The volume of the chamber is continuously changing: as the propellant burns, there is more volume for the gas to occupy. As the projectile travels down the barrel, the volume behind the projectile also increases. There are still other effects. Some energy is lost in deforming the projectile and causing it to spin. There are also frictional losses between the projectile and the barrel. The projectile, as it travels down the barrel, compresses the air in front of it.|$|R

40|$|Purpose / Context - Cool coating is {{a passive}} {{technique}} {{for reducing the}} solar heat gain and cooling energy consumption of buildings. However the radiation properties (i. e., solar reflectance and thermal emittance) of cool coating would be changed, usually adversely, during its ageing process, and its thermal performance would be degraded accordingly. UV could cause photolysis and photo-oxidative reactions in cool coating, thus {{is believed to be}} one cause for the degradation. Methodology / Approach – Groups of cool coating samples were exposed to UV radiation in an <b>accelerated</b> ageing <b>chamber.</b> The effects of UV were quantified by comparing the radiation properties of the samples before and after the exposure. Furthermore, the results of this UV exposure experiment were compared to a nature exposure experiment, to figure out the contribution of UV in the whole ageing process, which comprises the effects of numerous factors. Soiling {{is an important factor in}} the ageing process, thus its effects were investigated in this UV study as well. Key Findings / Implications – UV was found to be responsible for several percent of the total loss of solar reflectance of cool coating; while soiling was found to be the most significant factor for the total loss in the ageing process. Originality - Few studies have been conducted on quantifying the UV effects on the changes of radiation properties of cool coatings. This study fills this gap...|$|R
