5|$|Bitterest of <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{whispering}} campaign {{directed at}} Anthony Molloy, captain of HMS Caesar. Molloy {{was accused of}} cowardice by fellow officers for his failure to follow Howe's orders on both 29 May and 1 June. Molloy's request for an official court-martial {{to clear his name}} failed, and although his personal courage was not called into question, his professional ability was. Molloy was dismissed from his ship.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} al-Ma'mun entered Baghdad, the western provinces of the Caliphate had slipped away from {{effective}} Abbasid control, with local rulers claiming {{various degrees of}} autonomy from the central government. Egypt had become divided between two bitterly hostile factions, one under Ubayd Allah ibn al-Sari which had come to control Fustat and the south, while his rival Ali ibn Abd al-Aziz al-Jarawi and his Qaysi Arabs controlled {{the north of the}} country around the Nile Delta. In addition, Alexandria was {{in the hands of a}} group of Andalusian exiles. In northern Syria and the Jazira, the traditionally dominant Qays tribe had taken control, led by Abdallah ibn Bayhas and Nasr ibn Shabath al-Uqayli. Ifriqiya had fallen under the control of the Aghlabids, while Yemen was troubled by pro-Alid revolts. Perhaps the most threatening rebellion of <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> anti-Muslim Khurramite movement, which controlled large parts of Azerbaijan and Armenia.|$|E
5|$|In December 1941, Japan launched, {{in quick}} succession, attacks on British Malaya, the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, and Hong Kong. Churchill's {{reaction}} to the entry of the United States into the war was that Britain was now assured of victory {{and the future of}} the empire was safe, but the manner in which British forces were rapidly defeated in the Far East irreversibly harmed Britain's standing and prestige as an imperial power. Most damaging of <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Fall of Singapore, which had previously been hailed as an impregnable fortress and the eastern equivalent of Gibraltar. The realisation that Britain could not defend its entire empire pushed Australia and New Zealand, which now appeared threatened by Japanese forces, into closer ties with the United States. This resulted in the 1951 ANZUS Pact between Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America.|$|E

5|$|Rowley's {{force had}} also been active: Nereide under Captain Robert Corbet {{captured}} {{a number of small}} vessels off Port Napoleon in the late spring, including the brig Aigle, which he sent to the Cape of Good Hope with a prize crew that mutinied, killed their officer and took the ship to Île Bonaparte. The brig HMS Otter, under Captain Nesbit Willoughby, raided an anchorage at Rivière Noire District on 14 August, capturing a coastal vessel (which he later had to abandon) under heavy fire. Willoughby also recaptured Aigle shortly afterwards. Rowley himself had chased the Bellone in Raisonnable as the French ship emerged from Port Napoleon on 17 August, but had been unable to catch her. Most significant of <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> seizure of the island of Rodriguez by a British Army force from India under Lieutenant Colonel Henry Keating. This small island was close enough to Isle de France to provide an effective base for the British blockade squadron and a staging area for a future invasion of the French islands.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} held {{a number}} of lessons for the Australians, not least of <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> need for tanks. Although the APCs {{had been used to}} support the infantry during the operation, they lacked the firepower and armour to be an effective substitute for tanks which would likely have found the terrain and vegetation no obstacle and may have proven decisive. Meanwhile, the futility and waste of frontal tactics and massed bayonet charges against automatic weapons had once again been demonstrated. Yet such lessons still had not been fully grasped by Australian Army training doctrine, and under pressure from Townsend to press on with the attack Mackay had given the order to fix bayonets and charge due to the proximity of his forward platoons to the Viet Cong. Despite having long since ceased to be a decisive weapon of warfare, when ordered the Australians had unhesitatingly charged towards the Viet Cong machine-guns in the certainty of suffering casualties. As a result of their bravery 5 Platoon {{became one of the most}} highly decorated Australian platoons of the war. Yet aggression alone could not overcome concentrated firepower, and many survivors were later bitter about the order and losses suffered in these attempts. Another lesson identified included the need to thoroughly prepare an unsecure landing zone by fire prior to insertion. Likewise, during the initial contact A Company had been unable to call in artillery, and the need for a dedicated command and control helicopter to co-ordinate indirect fire during an airmobile assault was also evident.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} reform of <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> emancipation of the serfs, {{a policy that}} was unpopular with large sections of the nobility. When the committee appointed to bring it about dug in their heels and made difficulties, Alexander II asked Konstantin to join the committee in September 1857. Where the Tsar was unsure of himself, his younger brother was more forceful, quick tempered, and cared not what others might think of him.|$|E
25|$|Dunfermline's {{most famous}} son is the {{entrepreneur}} and philanthropist, Andrew Carnegie {{who was born}} in the town in 1835.

Most important of <b>all,</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> donation of the Pittencrieff Estate which he had purchased in 1903 to be converted into Pittencrieff Park. In 1888, two Dunfermline men, John Reid and Robert Lockhart, first demonstrated golf in the US by setting up a hole in an orchard, before Reid set up America's first golf club the same year, St. Andrews Golf Club in Yonkers, New York, with Andrew Carnegie one of the first members.|$|E

The ostensible cause was the future Charles III of Austria (1711–1740) claiming the vacant Spanish throne in 1701. Leopold engaged in the war but did not live to see its outcome, being succeeded by his Joseph I in 1705. Joseph's reign was short and the war finally {{came to an end}} in 1714 by which time his brother Charles III had succeeded him.|$|E

25|$|The 17th century brought major defeats and {{military}} setbacks on the Ottoman Empire's western frontier. With major wars occurring every few decades, Bosnia was economically and militarily exhausted. For Bosnia and Bosniaks, {{the most critical}} conflict of <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Great Turkish War. At its very start in the mid-1680s, the Habsburgs conquered nearly all of Ottoman Hungary, sending {{tens of thousands of}} Muslim refugees flooding into Bosnia. A similar process occurred with the Habsburg conquest of Lika and Slavonia. Thousands of Muslims from these parts fled eastward into the Bosnian pashaluk, while those who remained were forcibly converted to Catholicism. In total, it is estimated that more than 100,000 Muslims were expelled from the frontier regions and settled in Bosnia during this time. Many brought with them a new sense of hostility towards Christianity.|$|E
25|$|Of {{wild species}} of ungulate, deer are the {{preferred}} prey family. In {{a study in}} the Italian Alps, the most common prey species of <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), which made up 32.2% of nest remains. The roe deer was also a prominent prey item in the French Pyrenees (14.9%) and Switzerland (14.6%), respectively. In several parts of the Scottish Highlands, red deer (Cervus elaphus) are eaten with some regularity, the maximum representation there being 22.3% of prey remains in the Northwest Highlands. In North America, several deer species, but mainly mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) fawns, were significant in the diet in Washington state (14.3%) and California (12.7%). Around the Himalayas, the small white-bellied musk deer (Moschus leucogaster) is reportedly a favorite prey item (though no quantitative analysis are known). In the near Arctic regions of Scandinavia, reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) of both semi-domestic and wild stock are fed on with some regularity; one study in northern Sweden found reindeer formed 11.4% of prey items. In the northernmost stretches of Alaska, golden eagles are more scarce than in equivalent areas of Scandinavia and only occasionally hunt wild reindeer. However, golden eagles were reportedly the most prolific predator of neonatal calves from the Porcupine caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) herd of central Alaska. Partial moose (Alces alces) remains have been found at a nest in Sweden. Live fawns and carrion probably comprise most of the golden eagle's consumption of deer (certainly in larger-bodied species such as red deer). Among wild bovids, eagles are reportedly the main predator of Saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) calves in Mongolia and are regularly reported to take chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) and Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) calves in Europe. Mongolian gazelles (Procapra gutturosa) comprised about 15% of the remains found at a nest in Mongolia. Up to seven wild species of goat, five other wild species of sheep and at least two wild gazelle species are confirmed golden eagle prey. In North America, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) are occasionally hunted.|$|E

Motivations for the experiment included conducting a quick-reaction exercise for the seismometer network team to install sensors and interpret results, and to test the ability to handle increased web traffic from interested visitors from the general public. Shaking was detected at the stadium after a 90-yard touchdown run during a January 10, 2015 playoff game, dubbed a [...] "Kam Quake" [...] for the player making the run, Kam Chancellor.

Chris Ayers from Exclaim! opined that We've Come for You <b>All</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> band's strongest release since Sound Of White Noise (1993) and easily {{the best of the}} John Bush era: [...] "Grittier and more confident, the self-produced We've Come for You All is a certified classic that proves the ageless Anthrax are still a viable metal option." [...] Vik Bansal, of MusicOMH, summarized the album as [...] "a bold, sleek and raucous slab of modern metal", containing elements that were absent from many heavy metal albums at the time. Bansal cited [...] "What Doesn't Die" [...] for particular praise, noting the [...] "razor-sharp" [...] riffs on the song. He noted [...] "Cadillac Rock Box" [...] for sounding similar to bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd and Black Sabbath.

500|$|The {{addition}} {{of three different}} paths was suggested by Falstein and added about six more months of development time, mainly {{because of all the}} extra dialogue that had to be implemented for the interaction between Indiana and Sophia. Altogether, the game took around two years to finish, starting in early 1990, and lasting up to the floppy disk release in June 1992. The only aspect Barwood was not involved in at <b>all</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> production of voices for the enhanced [...] "talkie" [...] edition released on CD-ROM in May 1993, which was instead handled by Tamlynn Barra. The voice-over recordings for the approximately 8000 lines of dialogue took about four weeks, and were done with actors from the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. Harrison Ford was not available to record Indiana Jones's voice, so a substitute actor Doug Lee was used. The [...] "talkie" [...] version was later included as an extra game mode in the Wii version of the 2009 action game Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings, and distributed via the digital content delivery software Steam as a port for Windows XP, Windows Vista and Mac OS X that same year.

500|$|Slayer is {{considered}} a thrash metal band. In an article from December 1986 by the Washington Post, writer Joe Brown described Slayer as speed metal, a genre he defined as [...] "an unholy hybrid of punk rock thrash and heavy metal that attracts an almost all-male teen-age following". Describing Slayer's music, Brown wrote: [...] "Over a jackhammer beat, Slayer's stun guitars created scraping sheets of corrosive metal noise, with occasional solos that sounded like squealing brakes, over which the singer-bassist emitted a larynx-lacerating growl-yowl." [...] In an article from September 1988 by the New York Times, writer Jon Pareles also described Slayer as speed metal, additionally writing that the band [...] "brings the sensational imagery of tabloids and horror movies" [...] and has lyrics that [...] "revel in death, gore and allusions to Satanism and Nazism." [...] Pareles also described other [...] "Big Four" [...] thrash metal bands Metallica and Megadeth as speed metal bands. Slayer's early works were praised for their [...] "breakneck speed and instrumental prowess," [...] combining the structure of hardcore punk tempos and speed metal. The band released fast, aggressive material. The album Reign in Blood is the band's fastest, performed {{at an average of}} 220 beats per minute; the album Diabolus in Musica was the band's first to feature C tuning; God Hates Us <b>All</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first to feature drop B tuning and seven-string guitars tuned to B. AllMusic cited the album as [...] "abandoning the extravagances and accessibility of their late-'80s/early-'90s work and returning to perfect the raw approach," [...] with some fans labeling it as nu metal.|$|E
