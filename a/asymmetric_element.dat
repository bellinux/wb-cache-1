40|$|We {{present a}} new stabilised and {{efficient}} high-order nodal spectral element method {{based on the}} Mixed Eulerian Lagrangian (MEL) method for general-purpose simulation of fully nonlinear water waves and wave-body interactions. In this MEL formulation a standard Laplace formulation is used to handle arbitrary body shapes using unstructured - possibly hybrid - meshes consisting of high-order curvilinear iso-parametric quadrilateral/triangular elements to represent the body surfaces and for the evolving free surface. Importantly, our numerical analysis highlights that a single top layer of quadrilaterals elements resolves temporal instabilities in the numerical MEL scheme that {{are known to be}} associated with mesh topology containing <b>asymmetric</b> <b>element</b> orderings. The 'surface variable only' free surface formulation based on introducing a particle-following (Lagrangian) reference frame contains quartic nonlinear terms that require proper treatment by numerical discretisation due to the possibility of strong aliasing effects. We demonstrate how to stabilise this nonlinear MEL scheme using an efficient combination of (i) global L 2 projection without quadrature errors, (ii) mild nonlinear spectral filtering and (iii) re-meshing techniques. Numerical experiments revisiting known benchmarks are presented, and highlights that modelling using a high-order spectral element method provides excellent accuracy in prediction of nonlinear and dispersive wave propagation, and of nonlinear wave-induced loads on fixed submerged and surface-piercing bodies.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development and}} the applicability of a finite element sequence of computer programs for the elastic stress analysis of axisymmetric structures. The following topics are discussed:- (i) {{the need for an}} <b>asymmetric</b> <b>element,</b> (ii) the mathematical theory outlined in physical terms, (iii) the philosophy adopted in writing computer programs, and (iv) an ideal problem used to test the sequence of programs, Particular attention has heen paid to accuracy, minimization of errors and ease of-running programs. Thus, in determining the fifteen integrals required to obtain the element stiffnesses, algebraic equations v/ere used in preference to numerical integration and thus avoid both truncation error and round-off error. Care was taken in the formulation of these equations to allow for the possibility of one or more vertices to lie on the axis of symmetry and to allow for two vertices to have the same radius. The latter facility is not available in treatments by other authors. To enable the unsymmetric matrices used in the formation of element stiffness to be inverted; to improve the accuracy of the application of the overall stiffness matrix to the load vector; and in fitting surfaces by the method of least squares, special subroutines were written in a form suitable for partial pivoting. To avoid large ratios of matrix element size, which would prevent inversion on even the largest word length computer, a technique of changing origin and scaling v/as adopted in fitting surfaces by the method of least squares. The technique of changing origin was also used in the formation of certain of the integrals to obtain a greater degree of accuracy on the digital computers with their inherent round-off error. Axisymmetric analysis was eased by separating the computation into a sequence of discrete programs. Adopting this procedure (a) reduced the requirements for computer time. and space thus minimizing cost and restrictions imposed by normal operating procedures; (b) allowed decisions on restraint and external loading to be deferred until the relevant values were required and available; (c) allowed modifications to be made to any program in the sequence without having a feedback effect on any of the other programs, and, finally, (d) facilitated parametric studies to be made of the effect of varying geometry, material properties, restraints, and loading. The novel fitting of fourth order surfaces to displacements to obtain strains and stresses, a feature unique to this sequence of programs, produces a| high order of accuracy. The high order of accuracy was illustrated by the problem used to test the sequence of computer programs, where with three quarters of a million matrix elements, the resulting accumulation of round-off error only amounted to 0, 001 %. There was very good agreement between finite element results and Lame, the general error (except v/here the loads were applied) being about 0. 03 %, so that the accumulated round-off error was insignificant even with one thousand finite elements. In addition to solving small-deflect ion static-elastic problems, the described sequence of computer programs may be utilised to solve large displacement problems by adopting an iterative 'procedure and, by taking advantage of the mid-side nodes, small modifications would permit analysis of pseudo dynamic problems...|$|E

40|$|A {{challenge}} {{posed by}} future computer architectures is the efficient exploitation of their many and sometimes heterogeneous computational cores. This challenge {{is exacerbated by}} the multiple facilities for data movement and sharing across cores resident on such platforms. To {{answer the question of}} how systems software should treat heterogeneous resources, this dissertation describes an approach that (1) creates a common manageable pool for all the resources present in the platform, and then (2) provides virtual machines (VMs) with multiple `personalities', flexibly mapped to and efficiently run on the heterogeneous underlying hardware. A VM's personality is its execution context on the different types of available processing resources usable by the VM. We provide mechanisms for making such platforms manageable and evaluate coordinated scheduling policies for mapping different VM personalities on heterogeneous hardware. Towards that end, this dissertation contributes technologies that include (1) restructuring hypervisor and system functions to create high performance environments that enable flexibility of execution and data sharing, (2) scheduling and other resource management infrastructure for supporting diverse application needs and heterogeneous platform characteristics, and (3) hypervisor level policies to permit efficient and coordinated resource usage and sharing.

After exploring the techno-typological characteristics of these ‘mixed’ assemblages, possible reasons for the variability in bifacial elements and the causes for the occurrence of mixed assemblages, including the relationship between the Micoquian and Mousterian, are presented. Interpreting this phenomenon is preliminary since the evidence is coarse-grained due to many old excavations and a lack of chronostratigraphic information.

That the retina devotes more resources to processing dark contrasts predicts that natural images contain more dark information. We confirm this {{across a range of}} spatial scales and trace the origin of this phenomenon to the statistical structure of natural scenes. We show that the optimal mosaics for encoding natural images are also <b>asymmetric,</b> with OFF <b>elements</b> smaller and more numerous, matching retinal structure. Finally, the concentration of synapses within a dendritic field matches the information content, suggesting a simple principle to connect a concrete fact of neuroanatomy with the abstract concept of information: equal synapses for equal bits...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For most {{types of}} {{problems}} in numerical mathematics, efficient discretization techniques are of crucial importance. This holds for tasks like how to define sets of points to approximate, interpolate, or integrate certain classes of functions {{as accurate as possible}} {{as well as for the}} numerical solution of differential equations. Introduced by Zenger in 1990 and based on hierarchical tensor product approximation spaces, sparse grids have turned out to be a very efficient approach in order to improve the ratio of invested storage and computing time to the achieved accuracy for many problems in the areas mentioned above. Concerning the sparse grid finite element discretization of elliptic partial differential equations, recently, the class of problems that can be tackled has been enlarged significantly. First, the tensor product approach led to the formulation of unidirectional algorithms which are essentially independent of the number d of dimensions. Second, techniques for the treatment of the general linear elliptic differential operator of second order have been developed, which, with the help of domain transformation, enable us to deal with more complicated geometries, too. Finally, the development of hierarchical polynomial bases of piecewise arbitrary degree p has opened the way to a further improvement of the order of approximation. In this paper, we discuss the construction and the main properties of a class of hierarchical polynomial bases and present a symmetric and an <b>asymmetric</b> finite <b>element</b> method on sparse grids, using the hierarchical polynomia...|$|R
40|$|The static design {{requirements}} of some seismic codes, {{such as the}} Eurocode 8 and-in most cases-the Uniform Building Code, {{to allow for the}} effects of earthquake excitation acting in a direction other than the principal axes of the structure do not apply to one-way asymmetric systems. Therefore, with some exceptions, no specific provisions are considered for such systems to cover effects of structural asymmetry on the behaviour of elements located along the symmetric system direction. Aimed towards fulfilling this need, in this paper, a wide parametric study of the inelastic response of one-way asymmetric systems designed according to Uniform Building Code is carried out, considering two-component earthquake excitations. The analyses show that the maximum ductility demands on elements aligned along the asymmetric system direction are very close to, and even lower than, those obtained for symmetric reference systems. Conversely, the symmetric direction elements undergo significantly larger inelasticity than if they were located in symmetric reference systems. Subsequently, the overstrength needed by the symmetric direction elements to prevent such additional ductility demands for several stiffness and plan configurations is quantified. II is concluded that one-way asymmetry should be considered by seismic codes as an intrinsic system property, thus implying that specific provisions should be included for designing elements located along the symmetric system direction, in addition to those currently subscribed to design the <b>asymmetric</b> direction <b>elements.</b> (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

Actually, the total photocurrents(described by Jpp) are decided by both SOI and Zeeman splitting. The SOI generates the spin-dependent <b>asymmetric</b> transition matrix <b>elements</b> and scattering matrix elements in excitation and relaxation processes, respectively, which lead to the asymmetric distribution of electrons in each spin-splitting subband. The Zeeman splitting transforms the net spin currents to charge currents. Hence, the photocurrents are proportional to the Zeeman split energy and then the electron effective g-factor g ∗. In view of this, there are no common anion and cation in the InAs/GaSb superlattice interface; this structure belongs to the C 2 v symmetry. Hence, g ∗ presents in-plane anisotropy when the magnetic field is in different crystallographic directions [19]. We speculated that the co-effect of the anisotropic SOI and g ∗ make Jpp in the [100] and [010] crystallographic directions larger.|$|R
40|$|Members of the C/EBP {{family of}} basic-leucine zipper (bZip) {{transcription}} factors form heterodimers and bind to the CAAT box and other sequence-related enhancer motifs. Using a 32 P-labeled protein probe {{consisting of the}} bZip domain of C/EBP beta, we isolated a clone encoding C/EBP-related ATF (C/ATF), a bZip protein that heterodimerizes with C/EBP-like proteins but belongs to the CREB/ATF family. C/ATF homodimers do not bind to typical C/EBP DNA sites. Instead they bind to palindromic cAMP response elements {{such as that of}} the somatostatin gene. In addition, C/ATF-C/EBP beta heterodimers bind to a subclass of <b>asymmetric</b> cAMP response <b>elements</b> exemplified by those in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and proenkephalin genes. Transient transfection studies indicate that interactions between C/ATF and C/EBP beta are the basis for a functional cross talk between these two families of transcription factors that may be important for the integration of hormonal and developmental stimuli that determine the expression of subsets of genes in specific cellular phenotypes...|$|R
