5|$|The green <b>algae</b> are a {{large group}} of {{photosynthetic}} eukaryotes that include many microscopic organisms. Although some green <b>algae</b> are classified as protists, others such as charophyta are classified with embryophyte plants, which are the most familiar group of land plants. <b>Algae</b> can grow as single cells, or in long chains of cells. The green <b>algae</b> include unicellular and colonial flagellates, usually but not always with two flagella per cell, as well as various colonial, coccoid, and filamentous forms. In the Charales, which are the <b>algae</b> most closely related to higher plants, cells differentiate into several distinct tissues within the organism. There are about 6000 species of green <b>algae.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>algae</b> {{benefit from}} {{a safe place to}} live and consume the polyp's carbon dioxide and {{nitrogenous}} waste. Due to the strain the <b>algae</b> can put on the polyp, stress on the coral often drives them to eject the <b>algae.</b> Mass ejections are known as coral bleaching, because the <b>algae</b> contribute to coral's brown coloration; other colors, however, are due to host coral pigments, such as green fluorescent proteins (GFPs). Ejection increases the polyp's chance of surviving short-term stress—they can regain <b>algae,</b> possibly of a different species at a later time. If the stressful conditions persist, the polyp eventually dies.|$|E

5|$|Although not {{plants and}} {{therefore}} incapable of photosynthesis themselves, many sea anemones form an important facultative mutualistic relationship with certain single-celled <b>algae</b> species that {{reside in the}} animals' gastrodermal cells, especially in the tentacles and oral disc. These <b>algae</b> may be either zooxanthellae, zoochlorellae or both. The sea anemone benefits from {{the products of the}} algae's photosynthesis, namely oxygen and food in the form of glycerol, glucose and alanine; the <b>algae</b> in turn are assured a reliable exposure to sunlight and protection from micro-feeders, which the sea anemones actively maintain. The <b>algae</b> also benefit by being protected by the sea anemone's stinging cells, reducing the likelihood of being eaten by herbivores. In the aggregating anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima), the colour of the anemone is largely dependent on the proportions and identities of the zooxanthellae and zoochlorellae present. The hidden anemone (Lebrunia coralligens) has a whorl of seaweed-like pseudotentacles, rich in zooxanthellae, and an inner whorl of tentacles. A daily rhythm sees the pseudotentacles spread widely in the daytime for photosynthesis, but they are retracted at night, at which time the tentacles expand to search for prey.|$|E
5|$|Animals as a {{category}} have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals are eukaryotic and usually multicellular (although see Myxozoa), which separates them from bacteria, archaea, and most protists. They are heterotrophic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and <b>algae.</b> They are also distinguished from plants, <b>algae,</b> and fungi by lacking cell walls.|$|E

5|$|Anthozoan larvae {{either have}} large yolks or {{are capable of}} feeding on plankton, and some already have endosymbiotic <b>algae</b> that help to feed them. Since the parents are immobile, these feeding {{capabilities}} extend the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic <b>algae,</b> and therefore have to settle quickly and metamorphose into polyps. Instead, these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarians feed {{in several}} ways: predation, {{absorbing}} dissolved organic chemicals, filtering food particles {{out of the}} water, obtaining nutrients from symbiotic <b>algae</b> within their cells, and parasitism. Most obtain {{the majority of their}} food from predation but some, including the corals Hetroxenia and Leptogorgia, depend almost completely on their endosymbionts and on absorbing dissolved nutrients. Cnidaria give their symbiotic <b>algae</b> carbon dioxide, some nutrients, a place in the sun and protection against predators.|$|E

5|$|Salinity {{differences}} between the sections of the lake separated by the railroad causeway result in significantly different biota. A phytoplankton community dominated by green <b>algae</b> or cyanobacteria (blue-green <b>algae)</b> tint the water south of the causeway a greenish color. North of the causeway, the lake is dominated by Dunaliella salina, a species of <b>algae</b> which releases beta-carotene, and the bacteria-like haloarchaea, which together give the water an unusual reddish or purplish color, and the bacteria converts non-toxic mercury into toxic methyl mercury, which then flows into the Southern portion of the lake in a heavy brine layer through the causeway.|$|E

5|$|Cobalt is {{the active}} center of coenzymes called cobalamins, {{the most common}} example of which is vitamin B. As such, it is an {{essential}} trace dietary mineral for all animals. Cobalt in inorganic form is also a micronutrient for bacteria, <b>algae</b> and fungi.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{interactions}} can {{be classified}} broadly into a host and an associate relationship. A host is any entity that harbours another that is called the associate. Relationships within a species that are mutually or reciprocally beneficial are called mutualisms. Examples of mutualism include fungus-growing ants employing agricultural symbiosis, bacteria living in the guts of insects and other organisms, the fig wasp and yucca moth pollination complex, lichens with fungi and photosynthetic <b>algae,</b> and corals with photosynthetic <b>algae.</b> If there is a physical connection between host and associate, the relationship is called symbiosis. Approximately 60% of all plants, for example, have a symbiotic relationship with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi living in their roots forming an exchange network of carbohydrates for mineral nutrients.|$|E

40|$|The {{carotenoid}} {{composition in}} cells of a ketocarotenoid-producing <b>alga,</b> Chlorococcum, was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatgraphy (HPLC). Astaxanthin (free and esters), adonixanthin (free and esters), canthaxanthin, β-carotene, lutein, and some cis-isomers of ketocarotenoids were found. The <b>alga</b> Chlorococcum cells {{could produce a}} large amount of ketocarotenoid esters, like the <b>alga</b> Haematococcus pluvialis. The esters of astaxanthin and adonixanthin, and free canthaxanthin were the major carotenoids in the <b>alga</b> Chlorococcum cells, while astaxanthin alone was the major carotenoid in the <b>alga</b> Haematococcus pluvialis. The <b>alga</b> Chlorococcum cells might synthesize astaxanthin from β-carotene via canthaxanthin and adonixanthin in parallel, respectively, which was controlled by the culture conditions.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which the dissimilatory Fe(III) -reducing bacterium Shewanella <b>alga</b> adheres to amorphous Fe(III) oxide were examined through comparative analysis of S. <b>alga</b> BrY and an adhesion-deficient strain of this species, S. <b>alga</b> RAD 20. Approximately 100 % of S. <b>alga</b> BrY cells typically adhered to amorphous Fe(III) oxide, while less than 50 % of S. <b>alga</b> RAD 20 cells adhered. Bulk chemical analysis, isoelectric point analysis, and cell surface analysis by time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis demonstrated that the surfaces of S. <b>alga</b> BrY cells were predominantly protein but that the surfaces of S. <b>alga</b> RAD 20 cells were predominantly exopolysaccharide. Physicochemical analyses and hydrophobic interaction assays demonstrated that S. <b>alga</b> BrY cells were more hydrophobic than S. <b>alga</b> RAD 20 cells. This study represents the first quantitative analysis of the adhesion of a dissimilatory Fe(III) -reducing bacterium to amorphous Fe(III) oxide, and the results collectively suggest that hydrophobic interactions are a factor in controlling the adhesion of this bacterium to amorphous Fe(III) oxide. Despite having a reduced ability to adhere, S. <b>alga</b> RAD 20 reduced Fe(III) oxide at a rate identical to that of S. <b>alga</b> BrY. This result contrasts with results of previous studies by demonstrating that irreversible cell adhesion is not requisite for microbial reduction of amorphous Fe(III) oxide. These {{results suggest that the}} interaction between dissimilatory Fe(III) -reducing bacteria and amorphous Fe(III) oxide is more complex than previously believed...|$|R
