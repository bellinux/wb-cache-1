5|$|In 106AD, emperor Trajan finally {{defeated}} the Dacian kingdom of Decebalus and annexed {{it as the}} Roman province of Dacia Traiana. By the mid-2nd century, there were 44 auxiliary regiments stationed there, about 10% of the total auxilia. In Britain there were 60. Together these two provinces contained <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total auxiliary regiments.|$|E

5|$|Frome {{town centre}} {{contains}} {{a considerable number}} of independent shops, and a few chain stores. Retail is primarily aimed at serving the local population's requirements for food (there are two large supermarkets on opposite edges of the town, and three smaller supermarkets in the town centre), basic clothing, health and beauty, DIY and some electrical goods. However studies show that only <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town's population do their non-food shopping in the town. Banks and building societies have branches in the town centre.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, {{the last}} {{resident}} of Ashton Court Dame Esme Smyth, died. After the house became derelict, {{it was taken}} over by the City in 1959. Restoration has been an ongoing process since then, but even after extensive investment by both the council and from Heritage Lottery Fund grants, presently only <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building is occupied or usable. The available facilities of the house are rented out for business conferences, parties and weddings. In 2013 a fire damaged the northern wing. It was contained by Avon Fire and Rescue Service, otherwise the rest of the building would have been at risk.|$|E
5|$|Longyearbyen {{experiences}} {{a very high}} turnover; in 2008, 427 people (23 percent) {{moved away from the}} town. The average person lived in Longyearbyen for 6.3 years, although it is 6.6 years for Norwegians and 4.3 years for foreigners. In 2009, <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population had lived in the town since before 2000, and can thus be regarded as permanent population. The longest residing people tend to work in the mining industry, followed by local government employees.

5|$|Quantification of the {{proportion}} of barbarian-born troops in the 4th-century army is highly speculative. Elton has undertaken the most {{detailed analysis of the}} meagre evidence. According to this analysis, <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sample of army officers was barbarian-born in the period 350–400. Analysis by decade shows that this proportion did not increase over the period, or indeed in the early 5th century. The latter trend implies that {{the proportion}} of barbarians in the lower ranks was not much greater, otherwise {{the proportion of}} barbarian officers would have increased over time to reflect that.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies found}} that the {{financial}} crisis and accompanying recession could {{not account for the}} entirety of the slowdown and that structural changes likely share at least partial credit. A 2013 study estimated that changes to the health system had been responsible for <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recent reduction in inflation. Paul Krawzak claimed that even if cost controls succeed in reducing the amount spent on healthcare, such efforts on their own may be insufficient to outweigh the long-term burden placed by demographic changes, particularly the growth of the population on Medicare.|$|E
5|$|Although airpower {{was to be}} a {{major factor}} in the defense of Lima Site 85, it could not be applied without {{limitations}} and restrictions. The defense of Lima Site 85 was not the sole focus of limited air resources at the time. During this period, the 1968 Tet Offensive was underway in South Vietnam, the Marine outpost at Khe Sanh was under siege, and there existed an unprecedented flow of enemy logistical traffic which had to be interdicted. Lima Site 85 had provided direction to <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> USAF missions over North Vietnam and Barrel Roll from November1967 to 11March1968. No other facility existed to provide a similar coverage over these areas. While this loss was a serious blow to the USAF air effort, it was not crippling.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1940, Himmler {{opened up}} Waffen-SS {{recruiting}} to ethnic Germans {{that were not}} German citizens. In March 1941, the SS Main Office established the Germanische Leitstelle (Germanic Guidance Office) to establish Waffen-SS recruiting offices in Nazi-occupied Europe. The majority of the resulting foreign Waffen-SS units wore a distinctive national collar patch and preceded their SS rank titles with the prefix Waffen instead of SS. Volunteers from Scandinavian countries filled the ranks of two divisions, the SS-Wiking and SS-Nordland. Belgian Flemings joined Dutchmen to form the SS-Nederland legion, and their Walloon compatriots joined the SS-Wallonien. By the end of 1943 <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SS were ethnic Germans from across Europe, and by June 1944, half the Waffen-SS were foreign nationals.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{there are}} over 200 exotic species known to live in Redwood National and State Parks. Of these thirty have been {{identified}} as invasive species, ten of these are considered threats to local species and ecosystems. Exotic species currently account for <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total flora in the parks. Only about one percent of plant growth in old-growth areas are of exotic species, while areas such as the Bald Hills prairies have a relative cover of fifty to seventy-five percent exotic. The type of foreign vegetation also varies, with plants such as the English Ivy (Hedera helix), Spotted Knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), and the Poison Hemlock (Conium maculatum). The spotted knapweed and poison hemlock are both under consideration for addition to a high priority watch list maintained by the park system.|$|E
5|$|The dorsal and pelvic fins are angular, {{with the}} first dorsal fin larger than the second. The {{pectoral}} fins are narrow, pointed, and falcate (sickle-shaped); their shape separates this species from the similar-looking nurse shark. The origin of the first dorsal fin is about even with {{the origin of the}} pelvic fins, while the origin of the anal fin is even with or somewhat behind the origin of the second dorsal fin. The caudal fin has a shallow upper lobe and barely present lower lobe, comprising <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total length in adults. The dermal denticles are diamond-shaped, bearing 45 faint ridges radiating from a blunt point. Tawny nurse sharks are yellowish, reddish, or grayish brown above and off-white below, and are capable of slowly changing their color to better blend with the environment. Young sharks have starkly white lower eyelids.|$|E

5|$|The film follows Bond's {{mission to}} find two NATO atomic bombs stolen by SPECTRE, which holds {{the world to}} ransom for £100 million in diamonds, in {{exchange}} for not destroying an unspecified major city in either England or the United States (later revealed to be Miami). The search leads Bond to the Bahamas, where he encounters Emilio Largo, the card-playing, eye patch-wearing SPECTRE Number Two. Backed by CIA agent Felix Leiter and Largo's mistress, Domino Derval, Bond's search culminates in an underwater battle with Largo's henchmen. The film had a complex production, with four different units and <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film consisting of underwater scenes. Thunderball was the first Bond film shot in widescreen Panavision {{and the first to}} have running time of over two hours.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{expanded}} his comitatus {{into a major}} and permanent force. This was achieved {{by the addition of}} units withdrawn from the frontier provinces and by creating new units: more cavalry vexillationes and new-style infantry units called auxilia. The expanded comitatus was now placed under the command of two new officers, a magister peditum to command the infantry and magister equitum for cavalry. Comitatus troops were now formally denoted comitatenses to distinguish them from the frontier forces (limitanei). The size of the Constantinian comitatus is uncertain. But Constantine mobilised 98,000 troops for his war against Maxentius, according to Zosimus. It is likely that most of these were retained for his comitatus. This represented <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total regular forces, if one accepts that the Constantinian army numbered around 400,000. The rationale for such a large comitatus has been debated among scholars. A traditional view sees the comitatus as a strategic reserve which could be deployed against major barbarian invasions that succeeded in penetrating deep into the empire or as the core of large expeditionary forces sent across the borders. But more recent scholarship has viewed its primary function as insurance against potential usurpers. (See Strategy of the Late Roman army below).|$|E
