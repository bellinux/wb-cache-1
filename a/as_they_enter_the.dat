5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Dearly Stars {{is similar}} to previous games in the series, but with new elements and differences to the minigames. The gameplay was adjusted to allow the player the option to quickly play through the game's story, but head director Toshihiko Kujioka also wanted to add in gameplay elements that would add another layer of challenge. The story is told {{from the perspective of}} Ai Hidaka, Eri Mizutani and Ryō Akizuki—three prospective pop idols introduced in Dearly Stars <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> talent agency 876 Production, and deals with their training on their way to stardom. The player has access to the three idols' different scenarios when playing, and each one involves a branching plot line.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> room, the man {{stands up}} and holds the briefcase. During the third chorus, they engage in battle and {{circulate}} the room for defence. Inter cut scenes have the group dancing to the song in the room. Perfume member Kashiyuka summons a mini version of herself, holding onto it, and casting a spell against the man, making him fall to the ground. As they celebrate, Perfume member Nocchi goes towards him and retrieves the briefcase. However, the man {{stands up and}} transforms into a polar bear; he then pushes Nocchi to the ground. Perfume member A-Chan throws an apple as a detraction, and the group attacks the bear by using laser beams. Defeated, the polar bear shrinks and transforms into a plush toy. A-Chan picks up the plush toy, and Kashiyuka opens the briefcase to witness a small gold ornament. The video ends with the group exiting the office.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} tributaries of the Sava River found in its upper basin {{are characterized by}} relatively steep grades of flow, high flow velocities and rapids. Those are left tributaries: the Kokra, the Kamnik Bistrica and the Savinja; and right tributaries: the Sora, the Ljubljanica and the Krka (Sava). Further downstream larger rivers empty into the Sava, as the right bank of the basin grows steadily. Right tributaries in this lower segment of the basin start as fast flowing courses, only to slow down <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> Pannonian Basin. They include the Kupa, the Una, the Vrbas, the Ukrina, the Bosna, the Brka, the Tinja, the Drina and the Kolubara. Left tributaries in the lower segment drain plains consequently exhibiting less steep course grades, lower flow rates and meandering. They include the Sutla, the Krapina, the Lonja, the Ilova, the Orljava and the Bosut.|$|E
5|$|The player {{continues}} to {{journey into the}} remains of a once sprawling city {{at the base of the}} mountain. Eventually making it safely to the mountain, the traveler begins to climb it, struggling <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> colder climates and encounter deep snow and high winds. With the crevice still a fair distance away, the traveler falls and collapses in the snow. Six of the white-robed figures appear before the character and grant the traveler new energy, allowing the player to reach the summit of the mountain and walk into the crevice as the screen fills with white. The player is then shown the game's credits, playing over the ending cinematic scene. This scene shows a shooting star emanating from the crevice and traversing the path the traveler took through the ruins, and shows glimpses of other robed travelers heading towards the mountain. Eventually, the star comes to rest at the sand dune where the game began, and the player is given the option of starting the game again. As the credits end, the player is shown the PlayStation Network IDs of the other travelers who shared part of the trek.|$|E

The tradition was briefly lost following the 1999 season when Pitt's football program transitioned from playing in Pitt Stadium to Three Rivers Stadium in 2000 followed by Heinz Field in 2001. The tradition was resurrected beginning with the 2008 football season.|$|E

Moreover, the programme includes a listing of the church activities from the various ministries for the current Sunday {{as well as for the}} days ahead. Such activities are collectively referred to as 'Kingdom Opportunities,' and their publication in the bulletin is meant to attract participants or volunteers for the corresponding events.|$|E
25|$|Almost all of {{the rivers}} in Ecuador rise in the Sierra region and flow east toward the Amazon River or west toward the Pacific Ocean. The rivers rise from {{snowmelt}} {{at the edges of}} the snowcapped peaks or from the abundant precipitation that falls at higher elevations. In the Sierra region, the streams and rivers are narrow and flow rapidly over precipitous slopes. Rivers may slow and widen as they cross the hoyas yet become rapid again as they flow from the heights of the Andes to the lower elevations of the other regions. The highland rivers broaden <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> more level areas of the Costa and the Oriente.|$|E

Williams Road serves as the eastern terminus of the LaSalle Expressway, which begins paralleling NY265 and NY384 <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> city of Niagara Falls. The routes soon enter the Love Canal section of Niagara Falls at a junction with 102nd Street. Becoming a frontage road for the LaSalle, the routes fork at a junction with South Military Road.|$|E

25|$|In spring, {{the plant}} {{produces}} large, yellow flowers with 5-fold symmetry. The yellow petals {{are long and}} strap-like, and dangle over the umbrella-like style of the flower, which is held upside {{down at the end}} of a 50cm long scape. The stigma of the flower are found at the tips of the 'spokes' of this umbrella. Pollinating insects generally enter the flower from above, forcing their way into the cavity between the petals and umbrella, and depositing any pollen they are carrying on the stigmata <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>enter.</b> <b>The</b> pollinators generally exit the flower, having been dusted with the plant's own pollen, by lifting a petal. This one-way system helps to ensure cross pollination.|$|E
25|$|The novel {{begins in}} July 1805 in Saint Petersburg, at a soirée given by Anna Pavlovna Scherer—the maid of honour and confidante to the dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna.

It is known to everyone at the soirée that Pierre is his father's favorite of all the old count’s illegitimate progeny.|$|E
25|$|Several {{highways}} have a tolling system using SunPass and toll-by-plate {{open road}} tolling, with cash tolling being completely phased out as of 2014. Both the Dolphin and Airport expressways {{have had an}} eastbound toll for years with westbound tolls planned for as long but not implemented until November 2014. On November 15, 2014, the Miami-Dade Expressway Authority implemented their new all electronic open road tolling system on the Dolphin and Airport expressways. On the Dolphin motorists are tolled as soon <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> highway from any ramp, so toll evasion can no longer take place by exiting before reaching a booth, as before. The increased tolling was not well received by motorists in its first few days.|$|E
