40|$|A {{series of}} {{advances}} {{during the past}} decade transformed LF from a neglected disease of poor countries into a disease now recognized as potentially eradicable. Principal among the reasons for these advances were the identification of ivermectin and albendazole as new, effective anti-filarial agents and the discovery of new virtues for an old anti-filarial drug, DEC (i. e., its single-dose efficacy and macrofilaricidal action). These discoveries were essential for the subsequent creation of the Global Program to Eliminate LF, 1 whose very basis is the large-scale use of DEC, ivermectin (Mectizan�; Merck and Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ) and albendazole. Indeed, in many endemic countries literally millions of tablets of these drugs are distributed over <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>short</b> days each <b>year</b> (often on a single day), making GPELF the largest chemotherapy program ever undertaken. Currently it is just these three drugs that are available for use in single-dose, annual MDA programs. Albendazole is co-administered with ivermectin in areas of Africa and Yemen where LF and onchocerciasis are co-endemic. For all other LF-endemic regions, albendazole is co-administered with DEC. At the recommended dose levels, none of the drugs is completely macrofilaricidal, although all appear to inflict some lasting damage to adult worms. Both DEC and ivermectin kill mf efficiently; albendazole, on the other hand, has no direct effect on mf, but rather appears to suppress embryogenesis in the adult female worm. An alternative treatment strategy involving the use of DEC as a fortificant in table/cooking salt for a period of 1 − 2 years is currently used in just one country, but was a mainstay of the earlier, successful LF elimination program in China...|$|R

6000|$|He {{describes}} {{another side}} of the same over-spreading infirmity when he is explaining why it was always impossible for him ever {{to be anything but}} a Liberal. 'The restlessness of critical faculty,' he says, 'has done me good service when turned upon myself. I have never enjoyed any self-satisfaction in anything I have, ever done, for I have inevitably made a mental comparison with how it might have been better done. The motto of one of my diaries, [...] "Quicquid hic operis fiat poenitet" [...] may be said to be the motto of my life' (p. 254). A man who enters the battle {{on the back of a}} charger that has been hamstrung in this way, is predestined to defeat. A frequent access of dejection, self-abasement, distrust, often goes with a character that is energetic, persevering, effective, and reasonably happy. To men of strenuous temper it is no paradox to say that a fit of depression is often a form of repose. It was D'Alembert, one of the busiest of the workers of a busy century, who said this, or something to this effect--that low spirits are only a particular name for the mood in which we see our aims and acts for what they really are. Pattison's case was very different. With him, except for <b>a</b> very <b>few</b> <b>short</b> <b>years,</b> despair was <b>a</b> system, and an unreasoned pessimism the most rooted assurance of his being. He tells a thoroughly characteristic story of himself in his days as an undergraduate. He was on the coach between Birmingham and Sheffield. Two men shared the front seat with him, and conversed during the whole of the journey about the things which he was yearning to know and to learn. 'I tried once or twice to put in my oar, but it was a failure: I was too far below their level of knowledge; I relapsed into enchanted listening. I thought to myself, [...] "There exists then such a world, but I am shut out of it, not by the accidents of college, but by my own unfitness to enter"' (p. 148). Mankind suffers much from brassy incompetency and over-complacency, but Pattison is only one of many examples how much more it may lose in a man who has ability, but no fight and no mastery in him. As we have all been told, in this world a man must be either anvil or hammer, and it always seemed as if Pattison deliberately chose to be anvil--not merely in the shape of a renunciation of the delusive pomps and vanities of life, but in the truly questionable sense of doubting both whether he could do anything, and whether he even owed anything to the world in which he found himself.|$|R
