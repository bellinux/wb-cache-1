However, he discovers Jerktonium, a dangerous chemical element {{which serves as}} a trap for the citizens of Bikini Bottom and is capable of turning anyone into a jerk. He cooks it into fruitcakes that he intends to feed to all the Bikini Bottomites and turn them into jerks. In order to test it, Plankton gives SpongeBob a slice, but nothing seems to work on SpongeBob, who is immune to Jerktonium because of the combination of his small brain and his very big heart. Increasingly infuriated that his plan has seemingly failed completely to suffice, Plankton gives his fruitcake dispenser to SpongeBob, who promptly distributes the fruitcakes to all of Bikini Bottom and transforms all the residents into jerks. After realizing that the element works only on other people in Bikini Bottom instead and that SpongeBob is so full of Christmas spirit that he is immune to jerktonium, Plankton is forced to send out an evil wind-up robot version of SpongeBob to commit troublesome deeds to frame the real SpongeBob.|$|E

500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Sean Elliott of IFMagazine disliked the [...] "Scrappy-Doo {{qualities of the}} character".

Fan reaction to the character was generally negative as well. Ackles summed up the response as, [...] "No, no, we just {{want this to be}} about the boys." [...] Though Kripke believed that Tal was a [...] "terrific actress" [...] who [...] "did valiantly and beautifully with the part [...] gave her", he felt that introducing her as a love interest was a mistake and came to believe that women should only be introduced into the series as antagonists. The failure with Jo prompted the series writers to introduce Ruby the following season in an attempt to [...] "course-correct".|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} [...] "Mother Simpson" [...] was pitched by Richard Appel, {{who decided to}} do {{something}} about Homer's mother, who previously had only been mentioned once. Many of the writers could not believe that an episode about Homer's mother had not previously been produced. Part of the fun of an episode about Homer's mother for the writers was {{that they were able to}} solve several little puzzles, such as where Lisa's intelligence came from. The ending shot with Homer gazing at the sky was decided at the table read, but the drawing at the end was inserted by David Silverman because it was felt that the scene was so touching that no other lines were needed. As a result, no promos were aired over the credits during the original airing of the episode. Bill Oakley has admitted that he <b>always</b> <b>gets</b> teary-eyed when he watches the ending.|$|E

500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{and plot}} of Somari is substantially {{similar to that}} the original Sonic the Hedgehog. The game follows the player's quest to defeat Doctor Robotnik, who has converted all the animals of South Island into evil robots. However, the game features Mario as the main character, rather than Sonic. Mirroring Sonics emphasis on speed, Mario can run at high speeds, although gameplay {{as a whole is}} slightly slower. Items, bosses, levels, and enemies are all identical to Sonic. Somari must collect 100 golden rings in order to enter the bonus stage {{at the end of the}} level, but being injured by enemies causes him to lose rings. The game employs a timer as in Sonic, however regardless of what time is scored the player <b>always</b> <b>gets</b> a [...] "Time Bonus" [...] of 5000 points. As in Sonic, each level is divided into three acts, and the third act ends with a boss fight with Robotnik.|$|E

[...] "Get It Right" [...] and [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] both premiered on On Air with Ryan Seacrest on February25,2011, and were performed in the episode [...] "Original Song", on March15,2011. The song was also released on the iTunes Store in the United States on March15,2011.

The line was parodied in the webcomic Looking for Group where Richard, one of the primary characters, uttered a variation involving his own name, and in Family Guy, where the scene is parodied by Baby's parents questioning Johnny due to her youth.

500|$|NBC were {{positive}} about the project, {{but there was still}} some concern that the homosexual subject matter would cause alarm. Ellen DeGeneres' sitcom Ellen that aired on ABC was canceled the year before Will & Grace premiered because ratings had plummeted after the show became [...] "too gay". Despite the criticism ABC received for DeGeneres' coming out episode, [...] "The Puppy Episode", [...] "there's no question that show made it easier for Will & Grace to make it on the air," [...] said Kohan. He added, [...] "Will & Grace had a better shot at succeeding where Ellen failed, however, because Will has known about his homosexuality for twenty years. He's not exploring that awkward territory {{for the first time as}} Ellen did. The process of self-discovery and the pain most gay men go through is fascinating, but the average American is put off by it." [...] Kohan also commented that rather than concentrating on Will's sexuality, Will & Grace is using it as a device: [...] "It's like that When Harry Met Sally... line when Billy Crystal says, 'A man and woman can never be friends, because sex <b>always</b> <b>gets</b> in the way.' What we want to explore is what happens between a man and a woman when sex doesn't get in the way." ...|$|E
