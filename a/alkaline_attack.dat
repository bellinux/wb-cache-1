We demonstrate that the grafted samples show a resistance to harsh alkaline solution more than three orders of magnitude larger than that of pristine porous silicon, being mostly unmodified after about 40  min.

40|$|The {{recovery}} of gold from waste is more attracting {{with respect to}} other metals. Base on the data of World Gold Council, the request for gold had an increasing trend during the last decade. Gold is commonly extracted from mines by mercury amalgamation and more refined techniques such as, cyanidization, flotation and smelting. These are processes which have high impact on the environment, for example, mercury is a common by-product; beside from mercury amalgam based processes, which are obsolete. In the last years many efforts were made in order to design alternative environmentally acceptable procedures. Besides the obtainment of gold from ores, nowadays it is particularly important the extraction of gold from secondary sources such as electronic and electric waste (WEEE). By considering the great amount of precious metals contained in electronic devices, the recovery process of such waste seems economically sustainable and {{recovery of}} precious metals, including gold from e-waste, is {{necessary in order to}} save the natural raw materials. Hydrometallurgical process has been exploited more often than the pyro-metallurgical process. The basic hydrometallurgy processing steps include extraction, concentration/purification, and recovery.

40|$|Although adenine-requiring auxotrophs of Bacillus subtilis {{accumulate}} {{large quantities}} of inosine or hypoxanthine, or of both, they do not accumulate inosine- 5 ′-monophosphate (IMP). Experiments directed at understanding this phenomenon were conducted with an adenineless auxotroph and with a mutant derived from it which lacked alkaline phosphohydrolase. It was found that B. subtilis contains four different phosphohydrolases. Only one is an extracellular enzyme; it is a 5 ′-nucleotide phosphohydrolase which can be inhibited by addition of CuSO 4 to the medium. Of the three cellular enzymes, only one, an acid phosphohydrolase, cannot attack 5 ′-nucleotides; this enzyme is not repressed by inorganic phosphate. One of the two remaining surface-bound enzymes is a nonspecific <b>alkaline</b> phosphohydrolase which <b>attacks</b> both 5 ′-nucleotides and p-nitrophenyl phosphate; {{this is the only}} phosphohydrolase that is markedly repressed by inorganic phosphate. The other surface-bound enzyme is a nonrepressible 5 ′-nucleotide phosphohydrolase with double pH optima: one at neutrality and the other near pH 9. 0.

Now, most of the researchers are paying much attention on the suitable materials which can reduce the cost of construction as well as increase the strength properties of concrete. Mainly gravel and sand are used in the preparation of conventional concrete. While the use of an agricultural by-product i. e. coconut shell as a partial replacement with conventional coarse aggregates is expected to serve the purpose of encouraging housing developers in building construction. Environmental impact can also be reduced by making sustainable use of this waste.

The addition of the alkali metal hydroxides results in {{a change in the}} ionic strength of the solution, which causes a redistribution of the electronic density around the chain structure (Glukhovsky 1965). The OH− anions react with the surface of the fly ash particles via chemical hydration reactions, which causes the aluminosilicate network structure to break down and different complexes to form, such as Al([...] OH)_ 4 ^ - [...] or Al([...] OH)_ 6 ^ 3 - [...] and [...] SiO([...] OH)_ 3 ^ -, SiO([...] OH)_ 2 ^ 2 - [...] or SiO_ 3 ([...] OH)^ 3 - [...]. The actual complex that forms depends on the alkali concentration in the solution (Swaddle et al. 1994; Xu and Deventer 2000). Furthermore, the alkali metal cation Na+ is dispersed throughout the aluminosilicate network structure. When the aluminosilicate network structure is depolymerized, Na+ neutralizes the excess charge via a physical electrostatic reaction, thereby generating Si–O–Na+ bonds and hindering the reversibility of the reaction (Shi et al. 2011).|$|E

Geopolymer {{concretes}} {{are currently}} being commercialised in Australia and elsewhere around the world, with a view towards enhancing the sustainability of the world’s construction industry. The fundamental geopolymer binder is an aluminosilicate gel which displays key structural features on every length scale from Ångstroms up to centimetres, meaning that multiscale analysis {{is key to the}} development of a detailed understanding of geopolymer formation and perform-ance. Here, we present results from investigations of geopolymer nanostructure, focusing on the use of infrared spectroscopy as an analytical tool. The effects of different combinations of precursors in geopolymer formation provides critical information, in particular with regard to the rate of reaction and its impact on the final distribution of elements and structures within the geopolymer binder. Formu-lations are designed so that the same composition is obtained by the use of precur-sors which release their constituent elements at very different rates under <b>alkaline</b> <b>attack</b> during geopolymerisation, and this provides essential information regarding the role of different elements in forming strong and durable geopolymer struc-tures.

The samples were prepared with a poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) sheath and a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) core. The reagent used to hydrolyze the PBT was 1 M NaOH in 75 / 25 methanol to water since it appeared to react topochemically with the fiber. The solution reacted more rapidly with PET than with PBT. Thus, when necessary to retard the weight loss of the bicomponent fibers, after a 2 -h hydrolysis with this reagent to remove PBT, it was replaced with aqueous 1 M NaOH solution contain-ing 0. 1 % cetrimmonium bromide. Unlike homofil PET or PBT fibers, where <b>alkaline</b> <b>attack</b> appeared to be confined to the surface and left the residue relatively smooth, the bicomponent fiber was attacked unevenly, and penetration to the PET core occurred before all the PBT at the surface was removed. Nevertheless, most of the reaction was confined initially to the PBT sheath. The tenacity and extension at break of the PBT–PET fiber passed through a maximum as hydrolysis progressed. The fall in tenacity at high weight losses is ascribed to increasing surface defects in the fibe...|$|E

One method is to use fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composite rebars for conventional reinforcement in concrete.

In order to overcome such deficiencies, a new core-shell model of a hybrid composite rebar was developed for RC structures.

The particle size distribution of fly ash and the content of unburned carbon residue are known to affect the compressive strength of geopolymers. In this study, the effects of particle size and unburned carbon content of fly ash on the compressive strength of geopolymers have been studied over a compositional range in geopolymer gels. Unburned carbon was effectively separated in the − 46 µm fraction using an air classifier and the fixed carbon content declined from 3. 04 wt % to 0. 06 wt%. The mean particle size (d 50) decreased from 22. 17 µm to 10. 79 µm. Size separation of fly ash by air classification resulted in reduced particle size and carbon residue content with a collateral increase in reactivity with alkali activators. Geopolymers produced from carbon-free ash, which was separated by air classification, developed up to 50 % higher compressive strength compared to geopolymers synthesized from raw ash. It was presumed that porous carbon particles hinder geopolymerization by trapping vitreous spheres in the pores of carbon particles and allowing them to remain intact in spite of <b>alkaline</b> <b>attack.</b> The microstructure of the geopolymers did not vary considerably with compressive strength, but the highest connectivity of the geopolymer gel network was achieved when the Si/Al ratio of the geopolymer gel was 5. 0...|$|E

40|$|If {{concrete}} {{is used as}} {{a building}} material the tensile strength of the reinforcement {{is one of the most}} important material properties. Traditionally concrete is reinforced with steel rebars. Textile reinforced concrete (TRC) represents a new and innovative building material, in which the reinforced is made out of technical textiles. Technical textiles are made out of AR-glass or carbon. Even the glass is considered to be alkali-resistant, the AR-glass reinforcement shows a certain loss of tensile strength over the live time of a building member. This strength loss can be up to 40 % during an exposure time of 50 years. This loss of strength is mainly caused by an <b>alkaline</b> <b>attack</b> of the glass network due to the high alkalinity of the pore solution of concrete. Due to the requirements of the load-bearing capacity as well as the handling during the production of TRC building members, the reinforcement structures used meanwhile are impregnated with polymers. As polymers there are two different kinds used – water-based dispersions, e. g. SBR-dispersions, or reactive coatings, e. g. epoxy resins. The polymer-impregnation cannot only increase the load-bearing capacity but can also decrease the loss of strength of AR-glass. In order to quantify the long term loss of strength of such polymer-impregnated AR-glass reinforcement structures within the presented thesis a prediction model, called the "hull-model", was developed. The model is based on intensive laboratory research, which covers investigations of the single components of TRC (concrete, AR-glass reinforcement and polymers) as well as the compound material. Based on these laboratory investigations the deterioration mechanisms, which lead to a reduction of the tensile strength, could be identified. The physical as well as chemical processes, which lead to an decrease of the tensile strength, represent the basics of the model. The parameters of the model can all be determined by (comparatively simple) laboratory investigations. One of the main parameters, which affect the long-term loss of strength, is the diffusion coefficient of the polymer used to impregnated the AR-glass. In general the polymer-impregnation with epoxy resin leads to a reduction of the long-term loss of strength by the factor of 2. The model also allows identifying the main parameters, which affect the long-term loss of strength of polymer-impregnated AR-glass. The diffusion coefficient of the polymer as well as the shape of the reinforcement both affects the long-term loss of strength dramatically. Low diffusion coefficients (such as typical for prepreg-epoxy systems) as well as compact reinforcement cross-sections minimize the strength loss...|$|E
40|$|The {{technological}} development {{and application of}} waste-to-resource strategy is significantly critical and crucial in both environmental and manufacturing industries, via which we do not only provide practical treatments to toxic waste materials but also translate them into usable products. It has been considered as a preferred method which should be applied in future wastewater treatment strategies. In this study, we investigated the process of incorporating cadmium oxide and nickel oxide into ceramic-based materials with the phases of CdAl 4 O 7, and CdFe 2 O 4. Such products are of less harmful effect to the natural environment and can also be of beneficial use with their good mechanical properties identified by nano-indentation. We proved the possibility and provided an opportunity to convert the waste from wastewater treatment process to a new material resource. XRD is preferred for characterizing solid mixtures to determine the relative abundances of crystalline phases during the reaction process. As a result, we can obtain the relative abundance information on {{the growth of the}} crystalline products, such as CdAl 4 O 7, and CdFe 2 O 4 according to the change of fabrication temperatures. In that case, the starting reaction temperature and the optimized temperature (at which the completed reaction could be achieved) could be revealed. In Cd-Al system, the starting temperature for CdAl 4 O 7 formation is 900 °C, and the optimized formation temperature is around 1020 °C. On the other hand, for Cd-Fe system, such temperatures are of 700 °C and 850 °C correspondingly. In our research, it is shown that the ceramic-process is an effective strategy to stabilize the waste hazardous metals (cadmium and nickel) by materials such as aluminate, ferrite, and kaolin commonly used in ceramic industry. Through this method, the difficult-to-treat wasted metals would become reusable and applied in building and infrastructure projects. Products containing CdAl 4 O 7, CdFe 2 O 4 and NiAl 2 O 4 have shown higher resistance to acidic leaching, comparing to CdO and NiO used as the starting materials to simulate the waste metal forms discharged from the industrial stream. Furthermore, similar measurements by <b>alkaline</b> <b>attack</b> on the sintered products (NiAl 2 O 4 containing samples) were also studied. Besides the investigation to leaching behavior, the mechanical properties are also measured by nano-indentation in our work. The incorporation of metal waste into the fabrication of ceramic products is valuable due to the preferred stabilization mechanisms of crystal structures and the large volume of ceramic products needed by the construction industry. Furthermore, because the product safety and functionality should not be compromised, a fundamental understanding of the surface properties of metal containing phases should be further established, rather than relying solely on data from regulatory tests on bulk samples. Therefore, {{the results of this study}} demonstrate the superior mechanical properties of nickel spinel containing products, comparing to the cristobalite silica matrix, under severe acid attack. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E
