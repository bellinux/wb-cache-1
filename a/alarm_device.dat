25|$|The smoke {{detector}} has two ionization chambers, one {{open to the}} air, and a reference chamber which does not allow the entry of particles. The radioactive source emits alpha particles into both chambers, which ionizes some air molecules. There is a potential difference (voltage) between pairs of electrodes in the chambers; the electrical charge on the ions allows an electric current to flow. The currents in both chambers {{should be the same}} as they are equally affected by air pressure, temperature, and the ageing of the source. If any smoke particles enter the open chamber, some of the ions will attach to the particles and not be available to carry the current in that chamber. An electronic circuit detects that a current difference has developed between the open and sealed chambers, and sounds the alarm. The circuitry also monitors the battery used to supply or back up power, and sounds an intermittent warning when it nears exhaustion. A user-operated test button simulates an imbalance between the ionization chambers, and sounds the alarm if and only if power supply, electronics, and <b>alarm</b> <b>device</b> are functional. The current draw of an ionization {{smoke detector}} is low enough for a small battery used as sole or backup power supply to be able to provide power for months or years without the need for external wiring.|$|E
500|$|The station {{applied for}} and {{received}} a construction permit on August 9, 1958, to increase its broadcasting power from 250 to 1,000 watts, both day and night. The [...] FCC approved the application in January 1961 {{but only for a}} daytime power increase. In 1959, WINC engineer Philip Whitney designed a CONELRAD <b>alarm</b> <b>device</b> for FM stations. The CONELRAD system allowed for early nationwide warnings in the event of possible enemy attack during the Cold War. Whitney is also credited with creating many of the remote control systems used by radio stations, including the microwave remote control system. The National Association of Broadcasters presented Whitney with its annual Engineering Award on April 7, 1970, for his work.|$|E
500|$|Several {{milestones}} {{have occurred}} during the station's 75 years of history. [...] WINC was the station on which country music singer Patsy Cline made her debut in 1948, when Cline asked {{the leader of a}} [...] "hillbilly band" [...] for a chance to perform with them on air. [...] In the late 1950s, the station's chief engineer, Philip Whitney, designed a CONELRAD <b>alarm</b> <b>device</b> for FM stations to warn listeners {{in the event of an}} enemy attack during the Cold War. [...] Whitney also created many of the remote control systems used by radio stations. [...] He was awarded for his work by the National Association of Broadcasters in 1970. [...] WINC had difficulty renewing its license in the early 1970s, as it was airing 22 minutes of commercials per hour—in excess of what the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) permitted. The station encountered further trouble in 1988 when a local prosecutor called one of its promotions an [...] "illegal cash lottery"; a judge disagreed. [...] In that same year, the news department at WINC received an Associated Press Broadcasters Association national award for [...] "Best Radio Spot News".|$|E

50|$|The {{enuresis}} alarm methodology {{originated from}} French and German physicians {{in the first}} decade of the 20th century.

Despite early success, the treatment was not developed until the 1930s by two independent groups of psychologists: Orval Mowrer and Willie Mae Mowrer (1938) and John Morgan and Frances Witmer (1939).
