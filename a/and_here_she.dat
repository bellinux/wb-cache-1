Occasionally you may suggest to the script editor that you don't think your character will react a certain way, but with Ruth I have absolute trust in the scriptwriter's characterisation.|$|E

25|$|Early in {{the summer}} of 1861 the Soldiers' Relief Association was organized, with McCord as {{president}}. In July 1861, she was made president of the Ladies' Clothing Association. The first-named organization made the uniforms for the company of her son, Captain L. Cheves McCord, his mother furnishing the material. She resigned her presidency of the Soldiers' Relief Association in order to give her whole time to the military hospital established within the South Carolina College; this was in 1862, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>she</b> gave her greatest service. In her home, at the northwest corner of Pendleton and Bull streets, {{across the street from the}} college property, she received supplies from the women of the city -— supplies available for nourishment for the sick, and hospital comfort. Early every day, there was made in her kitchen a supply of corn bread and broth, heaped into plates and left on a long dresser on her back piazza, served day after day as the nourishment for wounded soldiers who could drag themselves across the street from the convalescent building on the campus.|$|E
500|$|Critics have judged Mom & Me & Mom and Angelou's other autobiographies [...] "in {{light of}} the first", and Caged Bird {{generally}} receives the highest praise. [...] Marjorie Kehe of The Christian Science Monitor, considers the book a sequel to Caged Bird.' [...] Many of the events described in Angelou's previous autobiographies are revisited in this one, some with more detail than others, such as her period of homelessness, which was described in Caged Bird, and her serious beating by her jealous boyfriend, which was first disclosed in Letter to My Daughter (2008), Angelou's third book of essays. [...] According to Fiona Sturges, who reviewed Mom & Me & Mom in the British publication The Independent, [...] "As in her previous books, these tales are told with clear-sightedness and an absence of self-pity, and they are no less grim for their familiarity. Angelou has never been one for florid prose, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>she</b> maintains a precise and economical style which makes these bleak moments more vivid, like a film from which you can't look away". [...] Sayers states that major dramatic events, such as the incident when Angelou was beaten, [...] "are delivered without much amplification or further reference".|$|E

2500|$|In August 2007, a {{demo version}} of Montag's song [...] "Body Language" [...] was leaked on On Air with Ryan Seacrest, which {{featured}} an uncredited rapped verse by Montag's boyfriend Spencer Pratt.

Montag released the promo single, [...] "Higher" [...] along with an accompanying video shot by Pratt to iTunes on February 5, 2008. The song and the video immediately elicited a negative response from the online community. Two weeks later, a ballad titled [...] "No More" [...] was leaked online, and Montag later released it as a promotional single the following month. Two more songs, [...] "Fashion" [...] and [...] "One More Drink" [...] appeared on the internet in June 2008.
