This also typically results in the window being raised above all other windows on screen. If a clickfocus model such as this is being used, the current <b>application</b> <b>window</b> continues to retain focus and collect input, even if the mouse pointer is over another <b>application</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E

When data was copied to the clipboard the clipboard label was set to that of the source <b>application</b> <b>window.</b> When data was copied from the clipboard the destination application window's label [...] "floated up" [...] to the label of the new data. The user was free to change the label of a window or the clipboard at any time.|$|E
