A design problem was formulated considering 2 objective functions and 7 constraints related to vehicle ride and handling performance. PIAnO, one of the PIDO (Process Integration and Design Optimi-zation) tool, was used to automate analysis procedures and perform a design optimization. In order to assess relation between performances and design variables, we perform the DOE (Design of Experiments). To find the optimal solution, we used Progressive quadratic response surface method (PQRSM), one of the design optimization techniques equipped in PIAnO. As an optimization result, we got an optimal solution and could improve lateral force stee...|$|E

5000|$|The Magna Sports was {{available}} in only four colours: Paris White, Calypso Red, Nautilus Blue (deep blue), and Frontier Green (deep green), the latter two colours being new to the TF series. This new model carried all the standard features of the Executive model on which it was based, plus a deck lid spoiler, red side strip, 16-inch alloy wheels (same as the Verada Ei, but polished), and unique interior trims such as a metal-style instrument cluster fascia. Its V6 was standard as on all Magnas, however, only the Sports could be optioned with a manumatic Sports Mode four-speed automatic transmission featuring {{for the first time}} on an Australian-built car, a manual shifting function (via a second transmission gate plane to the right of standard gear positions, with [...] "push-forward" [...] upshifts and [...] "push-back" [...] downshifts). The Sports had improved handling characteristics thanks to the addition of an 18 mm rear swaybar (a rear bar swaybar was not fitted to the standard Magna), 11 percent firmer rear springs, firmer upper control arm and trailing <b>arm</b> <b>bushes,</b> and suspension height lowered by 10 mm. Options included dual airbags and ABS. This specific model represented MMAL's foray into the Australian sporty family passenger car sector, as well as an initial and long overdue departure from the more conservative Japanese product planning.

50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the radius arm forward attachments not being on the axis of the lower link arm inner pivots, it would appear at first glance that free movement of the suspension would be impossible without some components bending, or the trailing <b>arm</b> elastomeric <b>bushes</b> being compressed unduly. However, as described above, the crossbeam is rubber mounted to the body. The crossbeam and lower links maintain the correct toe angle of one wheel relative to the other, however due to the relative angles of the trailing radius arms, body roll results in the entire cross-beam and lower links pivoting slightly about the crossbeam's mounting points, thus inducing a small amount of passive rear wheel steering, which may result in significantly improved handling. When the Jaguar components are re-used in other vehicles, the differential is often rigidly mounted to the chassis, different radius arm configurations are used, and the passive rear wheel steering effect is lost.|$|R

40|$|In Chapter Four, we {{analyzed}} {{the consequences of}} a major counterforce attack onRussia’s nuclear forces using approximately 1, 300 U. S. nuclear weapons.

It should be emphasized that 1, 300 weapons is well below the START II limit of 3, 000 to 3, 500, and the proposed START III limit of 2, 000 to 2, 500 but nevertheless represents a formidable counter-force capability. Rather than continue with the established pattern of bilateral <b>arms</b> negotiations, the <b>Bush</b> administration has opted to act unilaterally {{to reduce the number of}} deployed strategic weapons. 1 Candidate Bush’s May 23, 2000 speech on national security issues is the most detailed statement to date and deserves quoting at length. Russia itself is no longer our enemy. The Cold War logic that led to the creation of massive stockpiles on both sides is now outdated. Our mutual security need no longer depend on a nuclear balance of terror. The premises of Cold War nuclear targeting should no longer dictate the size of our arsenal. As president, I will ask the Secretary of Defense to conduct an assessment of our nuclear force posture and determine how best to meet our security needs. While the exact number of weapons can come only from such an assessment, I will pursue the lowest possible number consistent with our national security. It should be possible to reduce the number of American nuclear weapons signifi-cantly further than what has already been agreed to under START II, without compromising our security in any way. We should not keep weapons that our military planners do not need. These unneeded weapons are the expensive relics of dead conflicts. And they do nothing to make us more secure. In addition, the United States should remove as many weapons as possible from high-alert, hair-trigger status—another unnecessary vestige of Cold War confrontation. Preparation for quick launch—within minutes after warning of an attack—was the rule during the era of superpower rivalry. But today, for two nations at peace, keeping so many weapons o...|$|R
60|$|This {{dialogue}} {{took place}} in Eppie's earlier years, when Silas had to part with her for two hours every day, that she might learn to read at the dame school, after he had vainly tried himself to guide her in that first step to learning. Now that she was grown up, Silas had often been led, in those moments of quiet outpouring which come to people who live together in perfect love, {{to talk with her}} too of the past, and how and why he had lived a lonely man until she had been sent to him. For it would have been impossible for him to hide from Eppie that she was not his own child: even if the most delicate reticence on the point could have been expected from Raveloe gossips in her presence, her own questions about her mother could not have been parried, as she grew up, without that complete shrouding of the past which would have made a painful barrier between their minds. So Eppie had long known how her mother had died on the snowy ground, and how she herself had been found on the hearth by father Silas, who had taken her golden curls for his lost guineas brought back to him. The tender and peculiar love with which Silas had reared her in almost inseparable companionship with himself, aided by the seclusion of their dwelling, had preserved her from the lowering influences of the village talk and habits, and had kept her mind in that freshness which is sometimes falsely supposed to be an invariable attribute of rusticity. Perfect love has a breath of poetry which can exalt the relations of the least-instructed human beings; and this breath of poetry had surrounded Eppie from the time when she had followed the bright gleam that beckoned her to Silas's hearth; so that it is not surprising if, in other things besides her delicate prettiness, she was not quite a common village maiden, but had a touch of refinement and fervour which came from no other teaching than that of tenderly-nurtured unvitiated feeling. She was too childish and simple for her imagination to rove into questions about her unknown father; for a long while it did not even occur to her that she must have had a father; and {{the first time that the}} idea of her mother having had a husband presented itself to her, was when Silas showed her the wedding-ring which had been taken from the wasted finger, and had been carefully preserved by him in a little lackered box shaped like a shoe. He delivered this box into Eppie's charge when she had grown up, and she often opened it to look at the ring: but still she thought hardly at all about the father of whom it was the symbol. Had she not a father very close to her, who loved her better than any real fathers in the village seemed to love their daughters? On the contrary, who her mother was, and how she came to die in that forlornness, were questions that often pressed on Eppie's mind. Her knowledge of Mrs. Winthrop, who was her nearest friend next to Silas, made her feel that a mother must be very precious; and she had again and again asked Silas to tell her how her mother looked, whom she was like, and how he had found her against the furze bush, led towards it by the little footsteps and the outstretched <b>arms.</b> The furze <b>bush</b> was there still; and this afternoon, when Eppie came out with Silas into the sunshine, it was the first object that arrested her eyes and thoughts.|$|R
40|$|Let s {{praise the}} courage of the peasant farmer Farming is a risky venture, a very risky venture indeed. Unlike almost any other {{business}} enterprise, the inputs required for production are subject to natural factors, out of {{the control of the}} person in charge of the means of production. The success of the harvest, for example, depends on the interplay of climatic factors of rainfall and solar radiation and favourable weather conditions. It is this inter-active combination of climate, adequate inputs and added managerial skills that makes the difference between one farm and another. Over the years, experience has shown that farmers can have to deal with multiple extreme problems {{in the course of the}} same cropping season. In Nigeria, rain-fed lowland rice farmers can experience droughts and floods in the same field in the same year. These two factors can result in 80 % to 100 % crop loss, and on top of these can come outbreaks of pest and disease. One fatal case was in Eastern Nigeria in 1988 when an outbreak of African Rice Gallmidge was reported, destroying about 80 % of all rice fields. So much trouble Other recurrent problems can be the destruction of farmland by Fulani cattle, which is a frequent occurrence especially in Northern Nigeria. There many farmers have lost their lives in fracas that have taken place when they were protecting their farms from Fulani cattle rearers who are usually <b>armed.</b> Indiscriminate <b>bush</b> burning is also widespread, often destroying farm lands and farm stored products in the process. What interests me is how the peasant farmers, who constitute about 70 % of the occupational population of Nigeria, have been able to sail through these problems and still remain wedded to their farms, literally til death do us part. I have watched with keen interest how some wealthy men, such as retired military men and influential rich men including village chiefs, have packed up their bags and gone from the farm after just two to three years of cultivation. They have brought in and used heavy-duty equipment for land clearing and other farm operations, and the effects are easy to see. As you move along the roads, it is plain to the eye how their lands have been exposed to erosion. The remains of the structures build either as sheds or for storage purposes can be seen left in abandon in the bushes. One wonders if such buildings have not in fact been built for wild animals! Well, that might be a favour coming from above for the wild animals to enjoy what their domestic counterparts cannot enjoy. There was a time when there was an upsurge in these types of farmers in Nigeria. They probably just thought that when you plough money into the soil you just watch the harvest come, and reap millions, but Alas! most of them were disappointed. They failed to recognise that farming by itself needs hard work, taking risks, determination and involvement. Peasant farmers, on the other hand, are faithfully wedded to their farms come rain, come shine. Their courage in continuing in the face of their numerous problems is worth rewarding. The lack of rain in one year cannot deter them from continuing the next year, which is why often times you hear of rain makers. These are the people who are involved in praying for rain, especially when the planting season is being delayed. In some parts of Northern Nigeria, crops like rice are raised in nurseries for a month or so in anticipation of rain. Sometimes water is fetched from far away streams or almost dried-out ponds. Farmers there cultivate short season crops like millet and cowpeas. When one looks at the variety of food products in the markets and discover that most of these are produced by peasant hands with their hoes and cutlasses, one can have nothing but praise for their efforts. It is these farmers who change gear from producing only for consumption when they want to create surpluses and be able to send their children to higher school. This has become more competitive than ever before. They also want to have motor vehicles for conveying their products to their homes and markets, but these too demand resources. Wanting more it is these farmers [...] . A new lease of life is being brought to these farmers by the present rural electrification programme which has been embarked upon by the present government of Nigeria. The farmers will soon want to acquire household accessories like television sets and video machines. All of these desires will feed the expansion of their farmlands, but this will be hampered by the fragmentation of their lands due to the land tenure. Yet another challenge to overcome! We need to give a lot of encouragement to these categories of small farmers for their immense contribution to global food production. Providing them with small-scale infrastructures and subsidies of their farm inputs would help a lot, but at the end of the day, their future is in their hands, and in the hands of factors we cannot control.
