The lighter loading {{on their}} driving axles {{meant that they}} were even more prone to wheelslip than the Merchant Navy class, {{requiring}} very careful control when starting a heavy train.

5|$|The most usual call is a loud, short, <b>and</b> <b>rapid</b> caaw-caaw-caaw. Usually, {{the birds}} thrust their heads {{up and down}} as they utter this call. American crows can also produce a wide variety of sounds and {{sometimes}} mimic noises made by other animals, including other birds.|$|E
5|$|A tornado is not {{necessarily}} visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (as described by Bernoulli's principle) <b>and</b> <b>rapid</b> rotation (due to cyclostrophic balance) usually cause water vapor {{in the air to}} condense into cloud droplets due to adiabatic cooling. This results in the formation of a visible funnel cloud or condensation funnel.|$|E
5|$|After a {{year and}} a half of {{preparation}} and development, Behemoth premiered in May 2008. With its high speeds, tall heights <b>and</b> <b>rapid</b> changes in both direction and elevation, the attraction is one of the most aggressive thrill rides in the park. Behemoth also has a high hourly passenger throughput – making it one of the most efficient rides in the park.|$|E

5|$|Although slight {{changes in}} water level affect many species, {{the system as}} a whole also cycles and pulses with each change. Some transformations to the {{diversity}} of plant and animal life are natural, caused by fire or storms, and some are induced by humans, such as urban encroachment, the introduction of exotic species, <b>and</b> <b>rapid</b> global warming. Environmental conditions in the Everglades favor no particular species. Some species, such as snail kites and apple snails, do well in wet conditions, but wood storks and Cape Sable seaside sparrows (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis) do well in dryer circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 12,000 {{millipede}} {{species have}} been described. Estimates of the true number of species on earth range from 15,000 to as high as 80,000. Few species of millipede are at all widespread; they have very poor dispersal abilities, depending as they do on terrestrial locomotion and humid habitats. These factors have favoured genetic isolation <b>and</b> <b>rapid</b> speciation, producing many lineages with restricted ranges.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona are {{the most}} {{successful}} club in the competition's history, having won it on four occasions, followed by Anderlecht (Belgium), Milan (Italy), Chelsea (England) and Dynamo Kyiv (USSR / Ukraine) with two victories each. Barcelona, Atlético Madrid, Real Madrid (all from Spain), Anderlecht, Fiorentina (Italy), Rangers (Scotland), Arsenal (England) <b>and</b> <b>Rapid</b> Wien (Austria) hold the record for being runners-up the most times, with each team losing the final twice. Teams from England have won the competition the most, with teams from the country winning the competition eight times.|$|E

In the 11 rounds, he {{achieved}} eight draws and three losses in the blindfold games, as well as three wins, seven draws and one loss in the rapid games.

Scoring 6½/11 in the blindfold and 8/11 in the rapid, Carlsen accumulated 14½ from a possible 22 points. In May {{it was revealed}} that Carlsen had helped Anand prepare for the World Chess Championship 2010 against challenger Veselin Topalov, which Anand won 6½–5½ to retain the title. Carlsen had also helped Anand prepare for the World Chess Championships in 2007 and 2008.|$|E
5|$|Differentiating between {{infectious}} and non-infectious illness, {{and identifying}} the underlying etiology of infection, {{can be quite}} challenging.

A separate set of ride ratings criteria is used for attractions inside Splash Works, though the rides are still rated on a scale from 1 to 5.|$|E
5|$|Gatwick Airport, {{nowadays}} one of Britain's busiest international airports, {{opened on}} the edge of the town in the 1940s, encouraging commercial and industrial growth. After the Second World War, the British Government planned to move large numbers of people and jobs out of London and into new towns around South East England. The New Towns Act 1946 designated Crawley as the site of one of these. A master plan was developed for the establishment of new residential, commercial, industrial and civic areas, <b>and</b> <b>rapid</b> development greatly increased the size and population of the town over a few decades.|$|E

5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, {{the south shore}} region of Lake Erie was a popular {{vacation}} destination for the emerging middle class in the United States. The lake's islands, such as Kelleys Island and South Bass Island, were gaining a reputation for their freshwater bathing resorts. The Cedar Point peninsula, named for its abundance of cedar trees, was originally known for its fishing. Local fishermen leased land and built living quarters there.

Coinciding with the eyewall replacement cycle was an increase in southwesterly wind shear, a factor that further accelerated Patricia's degradation.
