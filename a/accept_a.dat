40|$|AbstractA content-free {{language}} {{is said to}} be weakly (w-) nonsingular if it is <b>accepted</b> by <b>a</b> nonsingular deterministic pushdown automaton in the sense of Oyamaguchi, Inagaki and Honda (1980). It is undecidable whether a deterministic pushdown automaton (dpda) <b>accepts</b> <b>a</b> w-nonsingular language and whether a dpda is nonsingular in the sense of Valiant (1973). Next, the class of super-nonsingular dpda's (which is a subclass of w-nonsingular dpda's) is introduced. It is decidable whether a dpda is super-nonsingular and whether <b>a</b> dpda <b>accepts</b> <b>a</b> super-nonsingular language. As a consequence, the problem of deciding whether <b>a</b> dpda <b>accepts</b> <b>an</b> LL(k) language reduces to the problem of deciding whether <b>a</b> super-nonsingular dpda <b>accepts</b> <b>an</b> LL(k) language...|$|R

5|$|Captive crickets are omnivorous; when {{deprived}} of their natural diet, they <b>accept</b> <b>a</b> wide range of organic foodstuffs. Some species are completely herbivorous, feeding on flowers, fruit, and leaves, with ground-based species consuming seedlings, grasses, pieces of leaf, and the shoots of young plants. Others are more predatory and include in their diet invertebrate eggs, larvae, pupae, moulting insects, scale insects, and aphids. Many are scavengers and consume various organic remains, decaying plants, seedlings, and fungi. In captivity, many species have been successfully reared on a diet of ground, commercial dry dog food, supplemented with lettuce and aphids.|$|E

Some cars are capable of taking a stretcher with a recumbent patient, but this often requires the removal of the front passenger seat, or the use of a particularly long car. This was often the case with early ambulances, which were converted (or even serving) hearses, as {{these were some of the}} few vehicles able to <b>accept</b> <b>a</b> human body in a supine position.|$|E

5|$|De re militari, a {{treatise}} on Roman military affairs by Vegetius, a late 4th or early 5th-century writer, contains considerable {{information on the}} late army, although its {{focus is on the}} army of the Republic and Principate. However, Vegetius (who wholly lacked military experience) is often unreliable. For example, he stated that the army abandoned armour and helmets in the later 4th century (offering the absurd explanation that this equipment was too heavy), which is contradicted by sculptural and artistic evidence. In general, it is not safe to <b>accept</b> <b>a</b> statement from Vegetius unless it is corroborated by other evidence.|$|E

It was a victory for Canterbury, but not a complete one, as Gerard avoided making a written profession, and it was specific to Gerard, not to his office. Gerard continued to oppose Anselm's attempts to assert Canterbury's primacy, but the two were reconciled before Gerard's death.|$|E
