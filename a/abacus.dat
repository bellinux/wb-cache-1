5|$|Besides {{population}} statistics, Villani {{also offered}} statistics on education. He wrote that {{boys and girls}} learning to read numbered 8,000 to 10,000 each year. There were 1,000 to 1,200 children learning to use the <b>abacus</b> and algorism for mathematics. In the four large, prestigious schools of Florence, there were always 550 to 600 students in attendance to learn proper grammar and scholastic logic.|$|E
5|$|The <b>abacus,</b> {{also called}} a {{counting}} frame, is a calculating tool {{that was in}} use centuries before {{the adoption of the}} written modern numeral system and is still widely used by merchants, traders and clerks in Asia, Africa, and elsewhere; it dates back to at least 2700–2300BC, when it was used in Sumer.|$|E
5|$|Performing {{addition}} {{is one of}} {{the simplest}} numerical tasks. Addition of very small numbers is accessible to toddlers; the most basic task, , can be performed by infants as young as five months and even some members of other animal species. In primary education, students are taught to add numbers in the decimal system, starting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult problems. Mechanical aids range from the ancient <b>abacus</b> to the modern computer, where research on the most efficient implementations of addition continues to this day.|$|E

25|$|The Fibonacci {{sequence}} {{is named after}} Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci. His 1202 book Liber <b>Abaci</b> introduced the sequence to Western European mathematics, although the sequence had been described earlier in Indian mathematics.

5|$|The market {{cross in}} Bath Street {{dates from the}} 15thcentury, with the shelter having been rebuilt in 1834. It has a central {{octagonal}} pier, a socket raised on four steps, a hexagonal shelter with six arched four-centred openings, shallow two-stage buttresses at each angle, and an embattled parapet. The shaft is crowned by an <b>abacus</b> with figures in niches, probably from the late 19thcentury, although the cross is now missing. It was rebuilt by Thomas, Marquis of Bath. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument (Somerset County No21) and GradeII* listed building.|$|E
5|$|A major {{influence}} on Ueshiba's early education was his elementary schoolteacher Tasaburo Nasu, {{who was a}} Shinto priest and who introduced Ueshiba to the religion. At {{the age of six}} Ueshiba was sent to study at the Jizōderu Temple, but had little interest in the rote learning of Confucian education. However, his schoolmaster Mitsujo Fujimoto was also a priest of Shingon Buddhism, and taught the young Ueshiba some of the esoteric chants and ritual observances of the sect, which Ueshiba found intriguing. His interest in Buddhism was sufficiently great that his mother considered enrolling him in the priesthood, but his father Yoroku vetoed the idea. Ueshiba went to Tanage Higher Elementary School and then to Tanabe Prefectural Middle School, but left formal education in his early teens, enrolling instead at a private <b>abacus</b> academy, the Yoshida Institute, to study accountancy. On graduating from the academy, he worked at a local tax office for a few months, but the job did not suit him and in 1901 he left for Tokyo, funded by his father. Ueshiba Trading, the stationery business which he opened there, was short-lived; unhappy with life in the capital, he returned to Tanabe {{less than a year later}} after suffering a bout of beri-beri. Shortly thereafter he married his childhood acquaintance Hatsu Itokawa.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{archaeological evidence}} {{for the use of}} the Greek <b>abacus</b> dates to the 5th century BC. Also Demosthenes (384 BC–322 BC) talked of the need to use pebbles for calculations too difficult for your head. A play by Alexis from the 4th century BC mentions an <b>abacus</b> and pebbles for accounting, and both Diogenes and Polybius mention men that sometimes stood for more and sometimes for less, like the pebbles on an <b>abacus.</b> The Greek <b>abacus</b> was a table of wood or marble, pre-set with small counters in wood or metal for mathematical calculations. This Greek <b>abacus</b> saw use in Achaemenid Persia, the Etruscan civilization, Ancient Rome and, until the French Revolution, the Western Christian world.|$|E

25|$|Gerbert {{learned of}} Hindu–Arabic digits and applied this {{knowledge}} to the <b>abacus,</b> but probably without the numeral zero. According to the 12th-century historian William of Malmesbury, Gerbert got {{the idea of the}} computing device of the <b>abacus</b> from a Spanish Arab. The <b>abacus</b> that Gerbert reintroduced into Europe had its length divided into 27 parts with 9 number symbols (this would exclude zero, which was represented by an empty column) and 1,000 characters in all, crafted out of animal horn by a shieldmaker of Rheims. According to his pupil Richer, Gerbert could perform speedy calculations with his <b>abacus</b> that were extremely difficult for people in his day to think through in using only Roman numerals. Due to Gerbert's reintroduction, the <b>abacus</b> became widely used in Europe once again during the 11th century.|$|E
25|$|An adapted <b>abacus,</b> {{invented by}} Tim Cranmer, called a Cranmer <b>abacus</b> is still {{commonly}} used {{by individuals who}} are blind. A piece of soft fabric or rubber is placed behind the beads {{so that they do}} not move inadvertently. This keeps the beads in place while the users feel or manipulate them. They use an <b>abacus</b> to perform the mathematical functions multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, square root and cube root.|$|E

25|$|The normal {{method of}} {{calculation}} in ancient Rome, as in Greece, was by moving counters on a smooth table. Originally pebbles (calculi) were used. Later, and in medieval Europe, jetons were manufactured. Marked lines indicated units, fives, tens etc. as in the Roman numeral system. This system of 'counter casting' continued into the late Roman empire and in medieval Europe, and persisted in limited use into the nineteenth century. Due to Pope Sylvester II's reintroduction of the <b>abacus</b> with very useful modifications, it became widely used in Europe once again during the 11th century This <b>abacus</b> used beads on wires, unlike the traditional Roman counting boards, which meant the <b>abacus</b> could be used much faster.|$|E
