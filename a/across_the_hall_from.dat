5|$|While a {{stand-up}} comedian, Larry David also {{worked as a}} store clerk, limousine driver, and historian. He lived in Manhattan Plaza, a federally subsidized housing complex in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> Kenny Kramer, {{the inspiration for the}} Cosmo Kramer character in Seinfeld. David then became a writer for and cast member of ABC's Fridays from 1980 to 1982, and a writer for NBC's Saturday Night Live (SNL) from 1984 to 1985.

5|$|The {{accounting}} department features Angela Martin, an admitted uptight and hypocritical woman {{who wishes to}} keep things orderly and make sure situations remain as serious as possible; Kevin Malone, a lovable, but dim-witted man who revels in juvenile humor and frequently indulges himself with gambling and M and Oscar Martinez is intelligent but often patronizing and whose homosexuality and Hispanic heritage made him a favorite target for Michael's unintentional off-color comments. Rounding out the office are the stern salesman Stanley Hudson, who barely stood for Michael's constant references to his Black-American heritage (he also doesn't like {{to take part in}} time wasting meetings and sometimes sleeps in them or works on crossword puzzles); eccentric quality assurance representative Creed Bratton; the kind and caring saleswoman Phyllis Lapin-Vance, who marries Bob Vance from Vance Refrigeration <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> the office; Andy Bernard is a salesman introduced in season three after the closing of the Stamford, Connecticut branch of Dunder Mifflin and the merging of the two; the bubbly and talkative customer service representative Kelly Kapoor; the promiscuous alcoholic supply relations representative Meredith Palmer; human resources representative Toby Flenderson, who is admittedly hated by, and often the target of abuse by Michael Scott; warehouse foreman Darryl Philbin; Warehouse dock worker and Pam's ex-fianc√© Roy Anderson, who was fired in the third season; and Michael's former love interest and former Vice President for Regional Sales for Dunder Mifflin Jan Levinson (Jan Levinson-Gould until her divorce in season 2).|$|E

50|$|The {{rest of the}} 1950s {{were still}} as busy as usual on {{this part of the}} coast with the {{lifeboat}} called out on numerous occasions. 1960 was the last year that Foresters' Centenary was on station at Sheringham. In this year the lifeboat was called upon three times. One of these rescues on 16 April was to a local fishing boat called Windsor Rose which was trying to return home in worsening weather conditions. The Foresters' Centenary towed the boat home to Sheringham. This little fishing boat can now be seen on display in the Sheringham Museum, <b>The</b> Mo, <b>across</b> <b>the</b> display <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> were <b>the</b> Foresters' Centenary is displayed.|$|R
5000|$|The roof of Westminster Hall (1395-1399) is a {{fine example}} of a hammerbeam roof. The span of Westminster Hall is 20.8 metres (68 ft. 4 in.), and the opening between the ends of the hammer beams 7.77 metres (25 ft. 6 in). The height from the paving of <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> to <b>the</b> hammerbeam is 12.19 m (40 ft.), and to the {{underside}} of the collar beam 19.35 metres (63 ft. 6 in.), so that an additional height in the centre of 7.16 m (23 ft. 6 in.) has been gained. In order to give greater strength to the framing, a large arched piece of timber is carried <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> rising <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the wall piece to the centre of the collar beam, the latter also supported by curved braces rising {{from the end of the}} hammerbeam.|$|R

25|$|Donna Kozlowski {{played by}} Jillian Armenante: He is Amy's clerk. An {{eccentric}} woman, she {{is from a}} wealthy family, but estranged from them. Donna is a genius (she finishes her law degree in {{one and a half}} years) and socially awkward. She is married to a convicted murderer, Oscar Ray Pant, and becomes roommates with Amy's brother Vincent. While living with him, she has a daughter by Oscar, Ariadne Gray Pant, to whom she gives birth in a plastic pool in Amy's living room. Her mother arrives while Donna is in the pool, but is unable to offer her support and leaves. Maxine ends up getting in the pool with Donna. Later, Oscar confesses to Donna that he is really guilty and she divorces him.

25|$|In the mid-70s, Matuschka began {{pursuing}} a writing career and spent many nights at Elaine's, the Carlyle Hotel, the St. Regis and P.J. Clarke's {{where she met}} and worked {{with a variety of}} writers and artists including: Salvador Dali, Norman Wexler (who wrote Saturday Night Fever in an apartment <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> her flat), gonzo journalist Anthony Haden-Guest, writer, sports publisher and socialite George Plimpton, Michael O'Donoghue (Saturday Night Live), producer Bertrand Castelli, socialites Ted Otis and the Van de Bovenkamps and bestselling author Joseph DiMona. Joe DiMona introduced her to Pine Associates Literary Agency in 1978 and the father/son duo represented her intellectual properties for a brief time. Excerpts of her unpublished memoir were reprinted in three issues of OUI Magazine, a subsidiary of Playboy Magazine, in 1981. One feature included an introduction by Anthony Haden-Guest and a pictorial spread by Jeff Dunas. She received a PEN Writing grant during this time. Since the 80s Matuschka's writings and poetry have appeared in dozens of publications and books worldwide from Glamour Magazine, to Oxford anthologies and academic journals {{on a wide range of}} subjects.|$|E
25|$|For {{more formal}} gatherings {{both before and}} after state events, as well as for {{entertaining}} visiting heads of state and their party, the Large Drawing Room, {{on the south side of}} the Monck Wing, is used. Previously called the Red Salon, the space underwent thorough renovations in 1901, updating it to the Edwardian style that was popular at the time, giving it boiserie panelling formed from plaster mouldings, a layered crown moulding, as well as windows and doors with chambranled montants, the latter openings also equipped with moulded, classical overdoors. On the walls of the drawing room are hung portraits depicting the viceregal consorts of previous governors general. Directly <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> the Large Drawing Room is the State Dining Room, which is reserved for state dinners for visiting heads of state with smaller parties, with the table seating a maximum of 42 guests. in 1909, the dining room too was renovated to a similar Edwardian look, but its present day layout did not emerge until the late 1940s, after various subsequent renovations. The sterling silver sets on display in this room are on loan from Buckingham Palace.|$|E
500|$|... "My Bologna" [...] is {{a parody}} of The Knack's hit song [...] "My Sharona", {{recorded}} and performed by musical parody artist [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic. Yankovic originally wrote the song while he attended California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, California; the original version of the parody was recorded in a bathroom <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> the radio station at which Yankovic worked. The title refers to Bologna sausage, specifically the Oscar Mayer brand popular in the United States. Yankovic sent [...] "My Bologna" [...] to Dr. Demento, who aired the song on his nationwide radio program, The Dr. Demento Show. [...] The song was a hit on the program, and eventually gained the number one spot on Dr. Demento's [...] "Funny Five" [...] countdown.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hall</b> {{effect is}} {{due to the nature of}} the current in a conductor. Current {{consists}} of the movement of many small charge carriers, typically electrons, holes, ions (see Electromigration) or all three. When a magnetic field is present, these charges experience a force, called the Lorentz force. When such a magnetic field is absent, the charges follow approximately straight, 'line of sight' paths between collisions with impurities, phonons, etc. However, when a magnetic field with a perpendicular component is applied, their paths between collisions are curved, thus moving charges accumulate on one face of the material. This leaves equal and opposite charges exposed on the other face, where there is a scarcity of mobile charges. The result is an asymmetric distribution of charge density <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> element, arising <b>from</b> a force that is perpendicular to both the 'line of sight' path and the applied magnetic field. The separation of charge establishes an electric field that opposes the migration of further charge, so a steady electric potential is established for as long as the charge is flowing.|$|R

2500|$|At {{around the}} same time however, the Navy created a new [...] "monitor office" [...] to {{centralize}} oversight of the new monitor program.

Gregory, but was effectively run by Chief Engineer Alban C. Stimers, to whom was entrusted the power of setting general plans and ship specifications. Stimers, an ambitious man, was keen to take credit for the design of the new monitors and frequently visited Ericsson's bureau to make changes to the specifications.|$|E

Fitch planned to publish a novel in serial form, with successive weekly chapters contributed by Fitch, his wife Anna, J. T. Goodman, Dan De Quille, Rollin M. Daggett and Clemens. The Occidental was published from October 29, 1864 until April 15, 1865 but ceased publication before Twain could contribute.|$|E
2500|$|According to Kramer, every drama he {{has written}} derives from a desire to {{understand}} love's nature and its obstacles. Kramer became involved with movie production at age 23 by taking {{a job as a}} Teletype operator at Columbia Pictures, agreeing to the position only because the machine was <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> the president's office. Eventually, he won a position in the story department reworking scripts. His first writing credit was as a dialogue writer for Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush, a teen sex comedy. He followed that with the 1969 Oscar-nominated screenplay Women in Love, an adaptation of D. H. Lawrence's novel. He next penned what Kramer calls [...] "the only thing in my life I'm ashamed of," [...] the 1973 musical remake of Frank Capra's Lost Horizon, a notorious critical and commercial failure whose screenplay was based very closely on Capra's film. [...] Kramer has said that his well-negotiated fee for this work, skillfully invested by his brother, made him financially self-sufficient.|$|E
2500|$|Lacking the $200 {{needed for}} musicians' union fees, Mitchell managed a few gigs at the Half Beat and the Village Corner in Toronto's Yorkville neighbourhood, but mostly played {{non-union}} gigs [...] "in church basements and YMCA meeting halls". Rejected from major folk clubs, she resorted to busking, while she [...] "worked in the women's wear {{section of a}} downtown department store to pay the rent." [...] During this era, {{she lived in a}} rooming house, directly <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> poet Duke Redbird. Without a lot of name recognition, Mitchell also began to realize each city's folk scene tended to accord veteran performers the exclusive right to play their signature songs‚Äîdespite not having written the songs‚Äîwhich Mitchell found insular, contrary to the egalitarian ideal of folk music. She found her best traditional material was already other singers' property and would no longer pass muster. She said, [...] "You'd come into a town and you'd be told, you can't sing that, you can't sing that." [...] She resolved to write her own songs.|$|E
