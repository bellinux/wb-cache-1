5|$|Once the commandos {{finally got}} out of the tunnel, they both swam towards the {{broadside}} of Card which anchored near the opening of the sewer. As planned, Nao and Hung attached two bombs on the ship, with one near the bilge and one at the engine compartment, just above the water surface. After the bombs had been attached to Cards hull, Nao inspected both bombs to ensure they had been assembled properly. After that Nao stuck the battery onto a pole and connected it to the bombs with wires, then set the timer. At 1.10am, the bombs were completed and both commandos retreated back into the sewer tunnel, <b>and</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>into</b> their canoes {{on the other side and}} rowed back to Thu Thiem. Again, the police patrol boat was waiting for Nao and Hung to arrive, because the commander wanted another bribe. As Nao and Hung approached the patrol boat, an explosion was heard and a bright light could be seen in the commercial port area. The South Vietnamese police patrol boat than started its engine and raced towards Card, instead of extracting another bribe.|$|E

It was a stormy day and the bay water was highly turbulent. As the escapees were not found, they were declared drowned by the prison authorities as it was conjectured that they drowned in the bay and their bodies swept out into the sea due to the turbulent bay currents.|$|E

After transferring to LM life support, the explorers lightened the ascent stage for return to lunar orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, one Hasselblad camera, and other equipment. They then pressurized the LM and settled down to sleep.|$|E

[...] On December 23 the Aspen trial judge granted the request—but to Colorado Springs, where juries had historically been hostile to murder suspects. On the night of December 30, with most of the jail staff on Christmas break and nonviolent prisoners on furlough with their families, Bundy piled books and files in his bed, covered them with a blanket to simulate his sleeping body, <b>and</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>into</b> the crawlspace. He broke through the ceiling into the apartment of the chief jailer—who was out for the evening with his wife—changed into street clothes from the jailer's closet, and walked out the front door to freedom.|$|E

In the US, [...] "You're Beautiful" [...] made its debut in the summer of 2005 on WPLJ, a prominent radio station in New York City, despite not having been released to radio yet.

2500|$|As {{the ribbon}} was cut {{to open the}} Market, fifty customers, the ten farmers with produce wagons, a policeman, and various city {{officials}} were present.

One porter, who worked for the Western Avenue wholesalers, apparently grew angry at the direct competition by the farmers, <b>and</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>into</b> one of the produce wagons. He began to freely give away the farmer's goods, before the angry spectators pulled him down. Other farmers complained of their goods being smashed in the street by young men and boys, who were accused of trying to start a riot.

2500|$|The 1951 Atlantic C-124 {{disappearance}} {{involved a}} Douglas C-124 Globemaster II of the 2nd Strategic Support Squadron, SAC which ditched {{on the late}} afternoon of 23 March 1951, after {{an explosion in the}} cargo and ensuing fire forced the pilots to ditch the aircraft at 50 degrees 22 minutes North, 22 degrees 20 minutes West, in the Atlantic Ocean several hundred nautical miles West Southwest of Ireland, as recorded in the logbook of the USCGC Cutter Casco. [...] The ditching and subsequent evacuation were successful, but when Casco arrived at the ditching position, the aircraft and its occupants had vanished. [...] The transport was on a military flight from Walker Air Force Base in Roswell, New Mexico, to RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk, England, with a stopover at Limestone Air Force Base in Limestone, Maine. It was commanded by Major Robert S. Bell, of the Second Strategic Support Squadron (similar to the 1950 Douglas C-54D disappearance in that respect). At 1300 hours, 23 March 1951, the aircraft radioed [...] "Mayday" [...] to Weather Ship USCGC Casco, reporting a fire in the cargo crates and giving their position as 51 degrees 30 Minutes North, 27 degrees 05 minutes West, according to the logbook of USCGC Casco. [...] Unable to extinguish the fire, Major Bell made the decision to ditch while there was still daylight. [...] The exact ditching position of 50 degrees 22 minutes North 22 degrees 20 minutes West was radioed to Casco. [...] The aircraft landed safely and intact.
