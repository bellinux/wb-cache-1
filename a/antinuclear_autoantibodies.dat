40|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} induced by Mycobacterium bovis in diabetes-prone nonobese diabetic mice was mapped in a backcross to the BALB/c strain. The subphenotypes—hemolytic anemia, <b>antinuclear</b> <b>autoantibodies,</b> and glomerular immune complex deposition—did not cosegregate, and linkage analysis for each trait was performed independently. Hemolytic anemia mapped to two loci: Bah 1 at the MHC on chromosome 17 and Bah 2 on distal chromosome 16. <b>Antinuclear</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> mapped to three loci: Bana 1 at the MHC on chromosome 17, Bana 2 on chromosome 10, and Bana 3 on distal chromosome 1. Glomerular immune complex deposition {{did not show}} significant linkage to any genomic region. Mapping of autoantibodies (Coombs’ or <b>antinuclear</b> <b>autoantibodies)</b> identified two loci: Babs 1 at the MHC and Babs 2 on distal chromosome 1. It has previously been reported that genes conferring susceptibility to different autoimmune diseases map nonrandomly to defined regions of the genome. One possible explanation for this clustering is that some alleles at loci within these regions confer susceptibility to multiple autoimmune diseases—the “common gene” hypothesis. With {{the exception of the}} H 2, this study failed to provide direct support for the common gene hypothesis, because the loci identified as conferring susceptibility to systemic {{lupus erythematosus}} did not colocalize with those previously implicated in diabetes.

The presence of autoantibodies in husbands and wives showed no relationship to the duration of marital contact nor to the presence of the autoantibodies in the probands.

In contrast, cell-mediated immunity to EBV was detected readily in peripheral leukocytes obtained during convalescence and in the follow-up studies. A blocking factor that abrogated leukocyte migration inhibition induced by EBV antigen was detected in acute and convalescent sera obtained from six of eight patients, whereas serum <b>antinuclear</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> were detected in the two patients whose sera failed to block leukocyte migration inhibition.

40|$|OBJECTIVE:To {{examine the}} {{presence}} of serum <b>antinuclear</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> in a healthy population. METHODS: Serum of 500 normal blood donors between 18 and 60 years of age were tested for {{the presence of}} autoantibodies. Antinuclear antibodies were detected by indirect immunofluorescence technique using HEp- 2 epithelial cells as the substrate. The presence of dnaN was detected by indirect immunofluorescence technique using Critidia lucillae as the substrate.

Despite the negative anti-ds-DNA, we still strongly suspected systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with renal involvement. Angiography was suggestive of vasculitis, so methylprednisolone pulse therapy was started, followed by oral prednisolone. On renal biopsy, fingerprint deposits were diagnosed on electron microscopy, and the pathologic diagnosis was Class III lupus nephritis. Fingerprint deposits are found in SLE and mixed cryoglobulinemia. But our case had negative cryoglobulin. A repeat test for anti-ds-DNA using a different method was positive.

40|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) is a multisystemic autoimmune disease resulting from immune system-mediated tissue damage. Clinical findings of SLE can involve skin, kidney, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, serosal membranes, and the hematologic and immune systems.

Additionally, immunocapture ELISA was used to investigate serum anti-IgE IgG autoantibodies. Serum IgE above 150 IU/ml, ranging from 152 to 609 IU/ml (median = 394 IU IgE/ml), was observed in 7 of 21 SLE patients (33 %), 5 of them presenting proteinuria, urinary cellular casts and augmented production of anti-dsDNA antibodies. While only 2 of 21 SLE patients (9. 5 %) were positive for IgE antibodies to aeroallergens, all 10 patients with respiratory allergy (100 %) from the atopic control group (3 males and 7 females), had these immunoglobulins.

Significantly increased titers of anti-nuclear Abs against histone H 1 and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB 1) and reduced donor specific alloantibody response were observed in Con A-injected recipients. Induction of Foxp 3 and IL- 10 in OLT livers of Con A-injected recipients suggested the involvement of regulatory T cells in this unique phenomenon.

METHODS: Iridectomy specimens were obtained during elective trabeculectomy from 31 eyes of 25 patients: 12 eyes with JIA-associated uveitis, 13 eyes with other uveitis entities, and 6 eyes with open angle nonuveitic juvenile glaucoma. Histopathologic and immunohistochemical analyses were performed. A semiquantitative scoring system was used with a scale ranging from 0 to 4 depending {{on the number of}} stained cells. RESULTS: An inflammatory infiltrate was present in 8 / 12 (67 %) specimens with JIA-associated uveitis. The cellular infiltrate in JIA specimens was characterized by the presence of CD 138 + plasma cells and CD 68 + macrophages, while the presence of CD 20 +, CD 4 +, and CD 8 + cells was variable. Presence of plasma cells in the inflammatory infiltrates in anterior uveitis correlated with <b>antinuclear</b> <b>autoantibody</b> (ANA) positivity regardless of the diagnosis of JIA.

However, their potency has not been comparatively evaluated with known HIV- 1 -neutralizing hmAbs against large panels of primary isolates. We report here the inhibitory activity of an engineered single chain antibody fragment (scFv), m 9, against several panels of primary HIV- 1 isolates from group M (clades A-G) using cell-free and cell-associated virus in cell line-based assays. M 9 was much more potent than scFv 17 b, and more potent than or comparable to the best-characterized broadly neutralizing hmAbs IgG 1 b 12, 2 G 12, 2 F 5 and 4 e 10. It also inhibited cell-to-cell transmission of HIV- 1 with higher potency than enfuvirtide (t- 20, Fuzeon). M 9 competed with a sulfated CCR 5 N-terminal peptide for binding to gp 120 -CD 4 complex, suggesting an overlapping epitope with the coreceptor binding site. M 9 did not react with phosphatidylserine (pS) and cardiolipin (CL), nor did it react with a panel of autoantigens in an <b>antinuclear</b> <b>autoantibody</b> (ANA) assay. We further found that escape mutants resistant to m 9 did not emerge in an immune selection assay. these results suggest that m 9 is a novel anti-HIV- 1 candidate with potential therapeutic or prophylactic properties, and its epitope is a new target for drug or vaccine development. © 2010 Landes Bioscience. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

Intra-peritoneal passive transfer of ascites containing the 6 - 19 mAb into BALB/c mice induces skin leukocytoclastic vasculitis and acute glomerulonephritis associated with cryoglobulinemia. Because IgG 3 interact with each other, we have determined whether noncryoprecipitating IgG 3 mAb were able to inhibit the cryoprecipitation of 6 - 19 mAb and the development of related tissue lesions. In vitro, the cryoprecipitation of 6 - 19 mAb was almost completely inhibited by a fourfold excess of a noncryoprecipitating non-RF IgG 3 (9 - 106) mAb derived from MRL-lpr/lpr mice. Cryoprecipitation of five other IgG 3 mAb was similarly inhibited by the 9 - 106 mAb, and two other noncryoprecipitating IgG 3 mAb, including the 2 - 6 D <b>antinuclear</b> <b>autoantibody,</b> inhibited the cryoprecipitation of 6 - 19 mAb. In vivo, pretreatment of BALB/c mice with 9 - 106 or 2 - 6 D mAb prevented the development of skin vasculitis and glomerulonephritis induced by the 6 - 19 mAb. The cryoglobulin formation was greatly diminished in 9 - 106 or 2 - 6 D mAb-treated mice, although their serum levels of 6 - 19 mAb and RF activity were comparable to those of control mice. This indicated that pretreatment with non-cryoglobulin IgG 3 inhibited the cryoglobulin generation and cryoglobulin-associated tissue lesions induced by an IgG 3 RF cryoglobulin-generating mAb. These results suggest that the balance of formation of IgG 3 autoantibodies with or without the cryoglobulin activity may be critical for the development of IgG 3 cryoglobulin-mediated tissue lesions in murine lupus, particularly in MRL-lpr/lpr mice...|$|R
40|$|Systemic {{autoimmune}} {{diseases are}} characterized {{by the presence of}} <b>antinuclear</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> (ANAs). Diluted patient sera are typically used to screen for the presence of ANAs by immunofluorescence microscopy with fixed HEp- 2 cells. Despite high quality test kits, reports of different laboratories frequently present controversial results. This study presents a recommendation for a unified processing and interpretation of HEp- 2 based screening for autoantibodies. We provide suggestions for selection of high quality test kits, optimized processing, and diagnostic procedures. For good laboratory practice, in addition to a relevant clinical diagnosis and an experienced laboratory specialist, the following procedure is highly recommended: initial HEp- 2 based screening by indirect immunofluorescence, starting with a 1 : 80 serum dilution and evaluation in a bright fluorescence microscope, pathological values from a titer of 1 : 160, internal quality checks, and unified interpretation. We aim to improve diagnostics and care for patients with autoimmune diseases as a central focus of the European Autoimmunity Standardization Initiative (EASI). ...|$|E
40|$|The {{cells that}} are {{considered}} in this application for an automated image analysis are Hep- 2 cells which are used for the identification of <b>antinuclear</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> (ANA). Hep- 2 cells allow for recognition of over 30 different nuclear and cytoplasmic patterns, which are given by upwards of 100 different autoantibodies. The identification of the patterns has recently been done manually by a human inspecting the slides with a microscope. In this paper we present results on image analysis, feature extraction, and classification. Starting from a knowledge acquisition process with a human operator, we developed an image analysis and feature extraction algorithm. A data set containing 162 features for each entry was set up and given to a data mining algorithm {{to find out the}} relevant features among this large feature set and to construct the classification knowledge. The classifier was evaluated by cross validation. The results show the feasibility of an automated inspection system...|$|E
40|$|Indirect {{immunofluorescence}} (IIF) with HEp- 2 cells {{has been}} used for the detection of <b>antinuclear</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> (ANA) in systemic autoimmune diseases. The ANA testing allows us to scan a broad range of autoantibody entities and to describe them by distinct fluorescence patterns. Automatic inspection for fluorescence patterns in an IIF image can assist physicians, without relevant experience, in making correct diagnosis. How to segment the cells from an IIF image is essential in developing an automatic inspection system for ANA testing. This paper focuses on the cell detection and segmentation; an efficient method is proposed for automatically detecting the cells with fluorescence pattern in an IIF image. Cell culture is a process in which cells grow under control. Cell counting technology {{plays an important role in}} measuring the cell density in a culture tank. Moreover, assessing medium suitability, determining population doubling times, and monitoring cell growth in cultures all require a means of quantifying cell population. The proposed method also can be used to count the cells from an image taken under a fluorescence microscope...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Several cytokines {{play a role}} in the {{production}} of autoantibodies such as RF and ANA by B-lymphocytes; the role of IL- 13 in this process has not been previously studied. We investigated the relationship between the serum concentration of this cytokine and circulating autoantibodies. Methods: IL- 13 serum levels, as well as RF and ANA, were evaluated in 282 patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases including RA (n= 84), SLE (n = 114), SS (n = 52) and Scl (n = 32). Results: Serum levels of IL- 13 (pg/ml) were significantly higher in patients with RA (p < 0. 00003), SLE (p < 0. 03), SS (p < 0. 0007), or Scl (p < 0. 025) compared to controls. IL- 13 serian levels correlated with those of RF in RA (p < 0. 00001), SLE (p < 0. 003) and Scl (p < 0. 03). IL- 13 levels were higher in RA (p< 0. 0003), SLE (p< 0. 005) and Scl (p< 0. 05) patients with RF than in patients,without RE SS patients with anti-SSA/Ro antibodies had significantly higher IL- 13 levels than SS patients without this autoantibody (p < 0. 04). No statistically significant correlation was found between IL- 13 levels and any other <b>antinuclear</b> <b>autoantibody,</b> total immunoglobulin levels or the main clinical features of each disease. Conclusion: The evidence of higher IL- 13 levels in our RA, SLE, SS and Scl patients confirms that this cytokine is involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune rheumatic diseases. The relationship of this cytokine with RF in RA, SLE and Scl, as well as with antiSSA/ Ro antibody in SS, strengthens the hypothesis that it plays a role in autoantibody production. However the different autoantibody synthesis by Bcells recognises different pathways depending on the underlying autoimmune disease...|$|R

Tear lysozyme concentration and serum <b>autoantibodies</b> (<b>antinuclear</b> antibodies, DNA-binding antibodies and intercellular cement substance antibodies) were measured. It was found that beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drugs may have a pharmacological effect on the lachrymal glands, {{but this was not}} associated with dry eyes or adverse reaction. Practolol was found to be capable of reducing tear lysozyme concentrations to very low levels, and this was initially associated with high titres of ICC antibody.
