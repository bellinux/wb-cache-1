40|$|The {{strategies}} that humans use to control unsteady locomotion {{are not well}} understood. A "spring-mass" template comprised of a point mass bouncing on <b>a</b> <b>sprung</b> <b>leg</b> can approximate both center of mass movements and ground reaction forces during running in humans and other animals. Legged robots that operate as bouncing, "spring-mass" systems can maintain stable motion using relatively simple, distributed feedback rules. We tested whether the changes to sagittal-plane movements during five running tasks involving active changes to running height, speed, and orientation {{were consistent with the}} rules used by bouncing robots to maintain stability. Changes to running height were associated with changes to leg force but not stance duration. To change speed, humans primarily used a "pogo stick" strategy, where speed changes were associated with adjustments to fore-aft foot placement, and not a "unicycle" strategy involving systematic changes to stance leg hip moment. However, hip moments were related to changes to body orientation and angular speed. Hip moments could be described with first order proportional-derivative relationship to trunk pitch. Overall, the task-level strategies used for body control in humans were consistent with the strategies employed by bouncing robots. Identification of these behavioral strategies could lead {{to a better understanding of}} the sensorimotor mechanisms that allow for effective unsteady locomotion...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Across a {{broad range}} of size and leg number, legged animals move with {{mechanics}} that resemble <b>a</b> simple <b>spring</b> mass system, consisting of a point mass bouncing forward on <b>a</b> virtual elastic <b>spring</b> <b>leg.</b> For polypeds (> 2 legs) the virtual leg is composed of N/ 2 legs acting in unison. Humans compensate for elastic surfaces by stiffening this virtual elastic <b>leg</b> <b>spring.</b> This has suggested spring mass models as the “control target ” used by legged organisms to run. Here we present comparative work testing the hypothesis that polypeds will use the same strategy of stiffening their virtual <b>leg</b> <b>spring</b> on soft surfaces. Data from insects (six legs) with accelerometer backpacks running on an elastic latex surface, and data from dogs (four legs) show that polypeds do not stiffen their virtual leg on compliant surfaces. We speculate on likely reasons for the difference in control strategy, which include differences in dynamic stability...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The role of {{compliance}} in walking controller synthesis is explored in this paper. Gait {{is designed for}} a simple biped with compliant legs using the concept of hybrid zero dynamics. Simultaneous optimization of gait and <b>leg</b> <b>spring</b> stiffness and optimization of gait at <b>a</b> fixed <b>leg</b> <b>spring</b> stiffnesses is carried out. Different cost functions based on energy are considered. The influence {{of compliance}} on gait {{and the influence of}} the measure of energy on optimal compliance are investigated. It is shown that minimum actuator energy consumption is obtained if leg stiffness is subject to optimization along with gait parameters. Sum of actuator work and spring work is higher than in optimized stiff-legged gait. Depending on the choice of cost function, fundamental different gait characteristics and optimal stiffnesses are obtained. I...|$|R
40|$|Trotting and hopping animals use muscles, tendons and ligaments {{to store}} and return elastic energy as they bounce along the ground. We {{examine how the}} {{musculoskeletal}} spring system operates at different speeds and in animals of different sizes. We model trotting and hopping as a simple spring-mass system which consists of <b>a</b> <b>leg</b> <b>spring</b> and <b>a</b> mass. We find that the stiffness of the <b>leg</b> <b>spring</b> (kl e g) is nearly independent of speed in dogs, goats, horses and red kangaroos. As these animals trot or hop faster, the <b>leg</b> <b>spring</b> sweeps <b>a</b> greater angle during the stance phase, and the vertical excursion {{of the center of}} mass during the ground contact phase decreases. The combination of these changes to the spring system causes animals to bounce off the ground more quickly at higher s p e e d s. Analysis of a wide size range of animals (0. 1 – 140 kg) at equivalent speeds reveals that larger animals have stiffer <b>leg</b> <b>springs</b> (kleg∝M 0. 67, where M is body mass), but that the angle swept by the <b>leg</b> <b>spring</b> is nearly independent of body mass. As a result, the resonant period of vertical vibration of the spring-mass system is longer in larger animals. The length of time that the feet are in contact with the ground increases with body mass in nearly {{the same way as the}} resonant period of vertical vibration...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—It {{may come}} as no {{surprise}} that a simple “planar unicycle ” (or “skate”) model can successfully follow a wall at high speed under PD-control. What would be surprising is that such a simple control mechanism may underly the control of one of Nature’s fastest terrestrial insects, the American cockroach. For this paper, we implemented the same controller (up to scale) believed to govern cockroach wall following to successfully control two models of the cockroach: a differential-drive mobile robot with a flexible artificial antenna and <b>a</b> lateral <b>leg</b> <b>spring</b> model with moving center of pressure as the control input. These physical and numerical experiments demonstrate the sufficiency of the cockroach’s putative controller in a real-world setting with unmodeled effects, and suggest how the nervous system might guide leg placement in response to sensory stimuli. This hierarchy of models may prove useful in generating prescriptive hypotheses for biological testing and hence elucidating the general principles that underly sensor-guided animal locomotion.
