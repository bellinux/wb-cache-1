Although the innate immune response does {{not play a}} significant role in these processes, the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>response,</b> in particular virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes(CTLs), contributes to most of the liver injury associated with HBV infection. CTLs eliminate HBV infection by killing infected cells and producing antiviral cytokines, which are then used to purge HBV from viable hepatocytes. Although liver damage is initiated and mediated by the CTLs, antigen-nonspecific inflammatory cells can worsen CTL-induced immunopathology, and platelets activated at the site of infection may facilitate the accumulation of CTLs in the liver.|$|E

40|$|Five human {{hepatitis}} viruses cause most of {{the acute}} and chronic liver disease worldwide. Over the past 25 years, hepatitis C virus (HCV) in particular has received much interest because {{of its ability to}} persist in most immunocompetent adults and {{because of the lack of}} a protective vaccine. Here we examine innate and <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> to HCV infection. Although HCV activates an innate <b>immune</b> <b>response,</b> it employs an elaborate set of mechanisms to evade interferon (IFN) -based antiviral immunity. By comparing innate and <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> to HCV with those to hepatitis A and B viruses, we suggest that prolonged innate immune activation by HCV impairs the development of successful <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses.</b> Comparative immunology provides insights into the maintenance of immune protection.

25|$|Secondary or {{peripheral}} lymphoid organs, {{which include}} lymph nodes and the spleen, maintain mature naive lymphocytes and initiate an <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>response.</b> The peripheral lymphoid organs are {{the sites of}} lymphocyte activation by antigens.

25|$|The {{principle}} behind immunization is {{to introduce}} an antigen, {{derived from a}} disease-causing organism, that stimulates the immune system to develop protective immunity against that organism, {{but that does not}} itself cause the pathogenic effects of that organism. An antigen (short for antibody generator), is defined as any substance that binds to a specific antibody and elicits an <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>response.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the innate}} immune system, the {{adaptive}} immune system is highly specific to a particular pathogen. Adaptive immunity can also provide long-lasting protection; for example, someone who recovers from measles is now protected against measles for their lifetime. In other cases it does not provide lifetime protection; for example, chickenpox. The adaptive system response destroys invading pathogens and any toxic molecules they produce. Sometimes the adaptive system is unable to distinguish harmful from harmless foreign molecules; {{the effects of this}} may be hayfever, asthma or any other allergy. Antigens are any substances that elicit the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>response.</b> The cells that carry out the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>response</b> are white blood cells known as lymphocytes. Two main broad classes—antibody responses and cell mediated immune response—are also carried by two different lymphocytes (B cells and T cells). In antibody responses, B cells are activated to secrete antibodies, which are proteins also known as immunoglobulins. Antibodies travel through the bloodstream and bind to the foreign antigen causing it to inactivate, which does not allow the antigen to bind to the host.|$|E

The DNA microarray showed the macaque genomic response to human influenza on a cellular level in each tissue. Both viruses stimulated innate immune system inflammation, but the 1918 flu stimulated stronger and more persistent inflammation, causing extensive tissue damage, {{and it did not}} stimulate the interferon-1 pathway.

25|$|Antibodies {{are a key}} {{component}} of the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>response,</b> playing a central role in both in the recognition of foreign antigens and the stimulation of an immune response to them. The advent of monoclonal antibody technology has made it possible to raise antibodies against specific antigens presented on the surfaces of tumors. Monoclonal antibodies can be acquired in the immune system via passive immunity or active immunity.The advantage of active monoclonal antibody therapy {{is the fact that the}} immune system will produce antibodies long-term, with only a short-term drug administration to induce this response. However, the immune response to certain antigens may be inadequate, especially in the elderly. Additionally, adverse reactions from these antibodies may occur because of long-lasting response to antigens. Passive monoclonal antibody therapy can ensure consistent antibody concentration, and can control for adverse reactions by stopping administration. However, the repeated administration and consequent higher cost for this therapy are major disadvantages.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Pulmonary {{infectious}} diseases cause significant {{morbidity and mortality}} in both industrialized and developing countries. <b>Adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> are required to defend the lung against pathogens that survive in normal macrophages and extracellular organisms that evade phagocytosis. Microbes initiate both innate <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> and specific <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses.</b> Innate <b>immune</b> <b>response</b> molecules regulate T-lymphocyte differentiation. Activated T-lymphocytes provide cytokines, which activate macrophages and lytic signals that lyse infected antigen-presenting cells. Antibodies produced by plasma cells facilitate microbial clearance through diverse effector mechanisms including opsonization, complement fixation and antibodydependent cytotoxicity.

40|$|Infants are {{protected}} from a severe {{respiratory syncytial virus}} (RSV) infection in {{the first months of}} life by maternal antibodies or by prophylactically administered neutralizing antibodies. Efforts are under way to produce RSV-specific antibodies with increased neutralizing capacity compared to the currently licensed palivizumab. While clearly beneficial during primary infections, preexisting antibodies might affect the onset of <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> and the ability to resist subsequent RSV infections. Therefore, we addressed the question of how virus neutralizing antibodies influence the priming of subsequent <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses.</b> To test a possible role of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) in this process, we compared the responses in C 57 BL/ 6 wild-type (WT) and FcRn(-/-) mice. We observed substantial virus-specific T-cell priming and B-cell responses in mice primed with RSV IgG immune complexes resulting in predominantly Th 1 -type CD 4 (+) T-cell and IgG 2 c antibody responses upon live-virus challenge. RSV-specific CD 8 (+) T cells were primed as well. Activation of these <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> was independent of FcRn. Thus, neutralizing antibodies that localize to the airways and prevent infection-related routes of antigen processing can still facilitate antigen presentation of neutralized virus particles and initiate <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> against RS...|$|R
40|$|Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) {{have been}} used widely for in vivo gene therapy. However, <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> to AAV have posed a {{significant}} hurdle in clinical application of AAV vectors. Recent advances have suggested a crucial role for innate immunity in shaping <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses.</b> How AAV activates innate immunity, and thereby promotes AAV-targeted <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses,</b> remains unknown. Here we show that AAV activates mouse plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) via TLR 9 to produce type I IFNs. In vivo, the TLR 9 -MyD 88 pathway was crucial to the activation of CD 8 + T cell responses to both the transgene product and the AAV capsid, leading to loss of transgene expression and the generation of transgene product–specific and AAV-neutralizing antibodies. We further demonstrate that TLR 9 -dependent activation of adaptive immunity targeting AAV was mediated by type I IFNs and that human pDCs could be activated in vitro to induce type I IFN production via TLR 9. These results reveal an essential role for the TLR 9 -MyD 88 –type I IFN pathway in induction of <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> to AAV and suggest that strategies that interfere with this pathway may improve the outcome of AAV-mediated gene therapy in humans...|$|R
25|$|T cells (thymus cells) and B cells (bone marrow- or bursa-derived cells) are {{the major}} {{cellular}} components of the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>response.</b> T cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity, whereas B cells are primarily responsible for humoral immunity (relating to antibodies). The function of T cells and B cells is to recognize specific “non-self” antigens, during {{a process known as}} antigen presentation. Once they have identified an invader, the cells generate specific responses that are tailored to maximally eliminate specific pathogens or pathogen-infected cells. B cells respond to pathogens by producing large quantities of antibodies which then neutralize foreign objects like bacteria and viruses. In response to pathogens some T cells, called T helper cells, produce cytokines that direct the immune response, while other T cells, called cytotoxic T cells, produce toxic granules that contain powerful enzymes which induce the death of pathogen-infected cells. Following activation, B cells and T cells leave a lasting legacy of the antigens they have encountered, in the form of memory cells. Throughout the lifetime of an animal, these memory cells will remember each specific pathogen encountered, and are able to mount a strong and rapid response if the same pathogen is detected again; this is known as acquired immunity.|$|E
500|$|The {{adaptive}} {{immune system}} evolved in early vertebrates and allows for a stronger immune response as well as immunological memory, where each pathogen is [...] "remembered" [...] by a signature antigen.

Natural antibodies have been defined as antibodies that are produced without any previous infection, vaccination, other foreign antigen exposure or passive immunization. These antibodies can activate the classical complement pathway leading to lysis of enveloped virus particles long before the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>response</b> is activated. Many natural antibodies are directed against the disaccharide galactose α(1,3)-galactose (α-Gal), which is found as a terminal sugar on glycosylated cell surface proteins, and generated in response to production of this sugar by bacteria contained in the human gut. Rejection of xenotransplantated organs is thought to be, in part, the result of natural antibodies circulating in the serum of the recipient binding to α-Gal antigens expressed on the donor tissue.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to {{the negative consequences of}} sleep deprivation, sleep and the intertwined circadian system have been shown to have strong regulatory effects on immunological functions affecting both the innate and the adaptive immunity. First, during the early slow-wave-sleep stage, a sudden drop in blood levels of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine induce increased blood levels of the hormones leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin. These signals induce a pro-inflammatory state through the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1, interleukin-12, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. These cytokines then stimulate immune functions such as immune cells activation, proliferation, and differentiation. It is during this time that undifferentiated, or less differentiated, like naïve and central memory T cells, peak (i.e. during a time of a slowly evolving <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>response).</b> [...] In {{addition to}} these effects, the milieu of hormones produced at this time (leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin) support the interactions between APCs and T-cells, a shift of the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance towards one that supports Th1, an increase in overall Th cell proliferation, and naïve T cell migration to lymph nodes. This milieu is also thought to support the formation of long-lasting immune memory through the initiation of Th1 immune responses.|$|E
