5|$|A further {{elaboration}} on {{this story}} is possibly found in a chronicle of Wincenty Kadłubek written some three centuries later. The chronicler, inadvertently or intentionally mixing different historic eras, talks of a past Polish war with the army of Alexander the Great. The countless enemy soldiers thrust their way into Poland, and the king himself, having previously subjugated the Pannonians, entered through Moravia {{as if it were}} <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>door.</b> He victoriously unfolded the wings of his forces and conquered the Kraków area lands and Silesia, in the process leveling Kraków's ancient city walls. The evidence of a dozen or more gords attacked and destroyed in southern Lesser Poland at the end of 9th century lends some archeological credence to this fanciful version of events.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{location}} of the active site of the rapid enzyme, acetylcholinesterase, {{near the bottom of}} a deep and narrow gorge indicates that alternative routes may exist for traffic of substrate, products or solute {{into and out of the}} gorge. Molecular dynamics suggest the existence of <b>a</b> shutter-like <b>back</b> <b>door</b> near Trp 84, a key residue in the binding site for acetylcholine, in the Torpedo californica enzyme. The homology of the Ω loop, bearing Trp 84, with the lid which sequesters the substrate in neutral lipases displaying structural homology with acetylcholinesterase, suggests <b>a</b> flap-like <b>back</b> <b>door.</b> Both possibilities were examined by site-directed mutagenesis. The shutter-like <b>back</b> <b>door</b> was tested by generating a salt bridge which might impede opening of the shutter. The flap-like <b>back</b> <b>door</b> was tested by de novo insertion of a disulfide bridge which tethered the Ω loop to the body of the enzyme. Neither type of mutation produced significant changes in catalytic activity, thus failing to provide experimental support for either <b>back</b> <b>door</b> model. Molecular dynamics revealed, however, substantial mobility of the Ω loop in the immediate vicinity of Trp 84, even when the loop was tethered, supporting the possibility that access to the active site, involving limited movement of a segment of the loop, is indeed possible...|$|R

25|$|Due to his age {{and declining}} health, Garrison retired from the Board of Education {{in the summer of}} 1967. The city's new Mayor, John Lindsay, {{appointed}} Garrison to a Mayor's Advisory Panel on the Decentralization of the New York City Schools. The Advisory Panel recommended extensive devolution of control over the city's public schools to locally elected neighborhood school boards. One locally controlled board in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville neighborhood began violating the union's contract in order to bring in a new teaching staff. This led to three strikes which engulfed the entire city school system. The devolution experiment ended after the strikes. The result was not unsurprising. Garrison had chaired a highly structured public hearing on devolution in 1966. After a local African American woman attempted to speak (even though she was not the witness list), Garrison ruled her out of order—causing the hearing to dissolve into a near-riot which required police (and for Garrison and the other Board members to scurry out <b>a</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> for their own safety).|$|E
