To {{assure the}} safe {{transportation}} of bulk liquid chemicals by tankers at sea, not only it is required internationally that dedicated pressure relieving devices should be installed onboard, but {{the heights of}} the pressure reducing valves, the activating pressure <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>prescribed</b> numerically, <b>although</b> these <b>are</b> based on experiences gained. Actually, researching the relationship among the wind, including the direction and force, the tanker, including her course and speed, the height of an individual pressure reducing valve is more meaningful to improve the safety of lives and properties at sea. Based on plume model, the relationship above mentioned is researched, and the mathematical relation <b>is</b> <b>also</b> presented in this paper...|$|R
5000|$|The Mess dress uniform is worn {{to formal}} or semi-formal {{occasions}} such as Dinings-in, Dinings-out, the annual Air Force Ball, weddings and other formal functions where civilian [...] "black tie" [...] would be prescribed. Until the early 1980s, this uniform {{differed from the}} current version, previously consisting of separate mess jackets, a white mess jacket worn in spring and summer and a black mess jacket worn in fall and winter, combined with black trousers and ties for males and an options of a black cocktail length or black evening length skirt for females. Black cummerbunds {{for males and females}} and white and black service hats for males <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>prescribed,</b> <b>although</b> wear of these hats was often optional. The current mess dress uniform in use since the early/mid-1980s consists of a dark blue mess jacket and mess dress trousers for males and a similar color evening length skirt for females. The jacket features ornate silver buttons, and is worn with the service member's awarded medals in miniature size, wings in miniature size, or other specialty insignia over the left breast, command insignia over the right breast for colonels and below (if applicable), satin air force blue bow-tie for males or tab for females, and a satin air force blue cummerbund. Cufflinks are to be either shined or flat round silver, or have the air force star and wing emblem, dark blue suspenders may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> worn, but remain hidden while the jacket is on. Commissioned officers, USAFA and AFROTC cadets, and OTS officer trainees wear hard shoulder epaulets (i.e., shoulder boards) similar to those worn by commissioned officers of the U.S Navy. Cadets and officer trainees wear insignia on their shoulder boards as applicable to their pre-commissioning rank position in their respective officer accession programs. Commissioned officer shoulder boards for colonels and below feature an officer's rank insignia in raised metallic thread, bordered by two silver vertical metallic stipes similar to sleeve braid. General officers wear shoulder boards covered nearly the entire length and width in silver metallic braid, with silver stars in raised metallic thread in number appropriate to their rank. Enlisted personnel wear the same large rank insignia that they would wear on their service dress coats. Officers also wear a single silver metallic sleeve braid on the lower sleeves of the Mess Dress coat, with sleeve braid coming in two widths, in a 1/2 inch width for colonel and below, and in a 3/4 inch width for Brigadier General and above. Enlisted personnel wear no sleeve braid. No hat or nametag is worn with the Air Force Mess Dress Uniform.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Patellofemoral {{complaints}} are frequently seen in younger and active patients. Clinical strategy is usually based on decreasing provoking activities as sports and demanding knee activities during work and leisure and reassuring the patient on the presumed good outcome. Exercise therapy <b>is</b> <b>also</b> often <b>prescribed</b> <b>although</b> evidence on effectiveness is lacking. The {{objective of this}} article is to present the design of a randomized clinical trial that examines the outcome of exercise therapy supervised by a physical therapist versus a clinically accepted "wait and see" approach (information and advice about the complaints only). The research will address to both effectiveness and cost effectiveness of supervised exercise therapy in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS). Methods/design 136 patients (adolescents and young adults) with patellofemoral pain syndrome are recruited in general practices and sport medicine centers. They will be randomly allocated receiving either 3 months of exercise therapy (or usual care. The primary outcome measures are pain, knee function and perception of recovery after 3 months and 12 months of follow up and will be measured by self reporting. Measurements will take place at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3 monthly until 1 year after inclusion in the study. Secondary outcome measurements include an economic evaluation. A cost-utility analysis will be performed that expresses health improvements in Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and incorporates direct medical costs and productivity costs Discussion This study has been designed after reviewing the literature on exercise therapy for patellofemoral pain syndrome. It was concluded that to merit the effect of exercise therapy a trial based on correct methodological concept needed to be executed. The PEX study is a randomized clinical trial where exercise therapy is compared to usual care. This trial started in April 2005 and will finish in June 2007. The first results will be available around December 2007. </p...|$|R
