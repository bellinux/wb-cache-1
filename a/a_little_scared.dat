60|$|She {{waited a}} moment, then withdrew, looking <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>scared.</b> Miss Haldin gazed {{at me in}} silence.|$|E
6000|$|Stephen {{raised his}} brows, and glanced towards his wife. Her face was dubious, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>scared.</b> There was a silence. Then Bianca spoke: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wal, you see I got upsot over yonder, and the {{old horse}} went home while I was floundering in a drift, so I tied on the buffalers to tote 'em easy, and come along till I see the {{children}} playin' in the holler. I jest meant to give 'em <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>scare,</b> but they run like partridges, and I kep' up the joke to see how Eph would like this sort of company," [...] and Gad haw-hawed again.|$|R
5000|$|Vin (voiced by Michael Dobson): Another of Extroyer's henchmen who is thin, and {{sometimes}} clumsy and dumb. He hates anchovies, as mentioned in Driven. He is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>scared</b> {{at times and}} he would sometimes be brave.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sorry if}} I did Reddy Fox an injustice," [...] thought he, [...] "but he makes {{so much trouble}} for other people that I guess {{no one else will}} be sorry. He isn't likely to bother any one for some time. Peter really ought to be punished, but somehow I don't feel so much like {{punishing}} him as I did. I'll just give him <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>scare</b> and let the scamp off with that. Now, I wonder where he can be. I have an idea he isn't very far away. Let me see. Seems to me I remember an old house of Johnny Chuck's not very far from here. I'll have a look in that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She looked <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>scared,</b> and I went on {{telling her}} the dream. 'My dear' I said, 'I dreamed that I saw you happy with those children.' ...|$|E
60|$|Margery, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>scared</b> at her father's peremptoriness, obeyed. It {{was plain}} that Jim {{had won the}} old man by that night's stroke, {{if he had not}} won her.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{thought that}} you had contributed?" [...] she echoed. It was clear she asked for enlightenment. He plunged on to afford it her, his glance <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>scared,</b> his cheeks flushing.|$|E

5000|$|Just after 35 {{years of}} marriage, {{his wife died}} on September 29, 1897. A few months later, Neal {{decided to return to}} the United States for a full two-year {{painting}} and exhibition tour. His trip started with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>scare,</b> as the passenger ship Pretoria out of Hamburg had engine failure, and Neal {{along with the rest of}} the passengers drifted about the Atlantic, turning their fifteen-day voyage into thirty-five days. Once back in the States, Neal quickly got to work, traveling and setting up studios in Washington, Cleveland, New York, and so on, including his second exhibition at the San Francisco Art Academy in 1898. [...] On June 18, 1899, The New York Times ran a full-page article describing David Neal's works with two paintings printed, Portrait of Mille N. and Nuns at Prayer.|$|R
5000|$|The lead vocal was sung by Mike Love with Brian Wilson during February and March 1966 at United Western Recorders. Brian {{stated in}} 1996, [...] "This showcased Mike Love's voice. Listen for the twelve-string guitar {{right after the}} lyric I'm <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>scared</b> 'cause I haven't been home in a long time." [...] Brian added, [...] "He just really nailed it, real {{powerful}} voice, very souped-up kind of a sound.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, ma'am," [...] said Dan, meekly, {{and looked}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>scared</b> by the serious {{tone of the}} last remarks, for he hated books, yet had evidently {{made up his mind}} to study {{anything}} she proposed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} I am <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>scared,</b> 'way down deep," [...] said Dorinda. [...] "I believe I am. But I'm {{going to do}} it for all that, and the scareder I get the more I'll do it." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{answer to}} Leeby's nods, Hendry slowly {{pulled out his}} boots from beneath the table, and sat looking at them, preparatory to putting them on. He was {{beginning}} at last to be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>scared,</b> though his face did not show it.|$|E
5000|$|The two-hour sixteen-minute {{match was}} briefly {{interrupted}} by noisy protesters, {{one of whom}} ran onto the court with a lit flare. Tournament director Gilbert Ysern said security [...] "acted efficiently and quickly and handled situation very well." [...] Both players appeared to be rattled by the event, dropping serve immediately after it. [...] "I felt <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>scared</b> at the first moment because I didn't see what's going on. I just turned there and I watch a guy with some fire," [...] remarked Nadal. [...] Ferrer said the event did not affect his play. Ten people were arrested in total.|$|R
60|$|A message {{came for}} Mary about ten o'clock, brought by <b>a</b> <b>scared</b> <b>little</b> girl, who whispered {{it to her}} at the door. Mary apologized. She had to go out. The party broke up. Mary {{disappeared}} into the next room and returned in a shawl and bonnet, carrying a small brown paper parcel. Joan walked with her as far as the King's Road.|$|R
6000|$|And {{while he}} was dreaming this, Arthur was leading Hetty to the dance and saying to her in low hurried tones, [...] "I shall be in the wood the day after to-morrow at seven; come as early as you can." [...] And Hetty's foolish joys and hopes, which had flown away for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> space, <b>scared</b> by <b>a</b> mere nothing, now all came {{fluttering}} back, unconscious of the real peril. She was happy {{for the first time}} this long day, and wished that dance would last for hours. Arthur wished it too; it was the last weakness he meant to indulge in; and a man never lies with more delicious languor under the influence of a passion than when he has persuaded himself that he shall subdue it to-morrow.|$|R
6000|$|MARGARET. I am {{not quite}} sure whether I want you to. It makes such a difference. Perhaps you won't know me. Even the pool is looking <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>scared.</b> (The change in her voice makes him open his eyes quickly. She confronts him shyly.) What do you think? Will I do? ...|$|E
6000|$|She, on her part, was {{astonished}} and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>scared</b> {{by her own}} complaisant weakness, and as they came out into the lighter part of the walk she disengaged herself with a self-derisive remark, and asked, [...] "Do you always take such good care of the arms of your girl friends?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] said Marriot, looking <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>scared,</b> [...] "I thought I {{would be}} the first of our lot to go. Often I have kept him up late in this very room talking of my own troubles, and little {{guessing}} why he sometimes treated them a little testily." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I had spilled that pudding on purpose," [...] Jims said vindictively, {{and with}} the saying his anger evaporated--Jims never could stay angry long--and left him merely <b>a</b> <b>scared</b> <b>little</b> fellow, with velvety, nut-brown eyes full of fear that should {{have no place in}} a child's eyes. He looked so small and {{helpless}} as he crouched against the door that one might have wondered if even Aunt Augusta would not have relented had she seen him.|$|R
50|$|During the Brass Bishop incident, {{the team}} {{encounters}} a church full of zombified townspeople. Flex's teammate Man-Bot reports no life signs, {{other than the}} church-goers but <b>a</b> <b>scared</b> <b>little</b> girl emerges from the crowd. The team follows her directions, flying off to where the girl said all the people had gone. While mid-flight, Flex is the one to realize that Man-Bot did not register the girl's lifesigns. His warning saves the team from flying nose-first into a mysterious, shielded structure.|$|R
5000|$|The 14 track {{album was}} {{produced}} and engineered by Micah Carli (of Hawthorne Heights) at Popside Studios in Troy, Ohio, mixed and additional production by Jamie Woolford (The Stereo, Punchline, Gin Blossoms), and mastered by Dan Coutant (Hostage Calm, Lemuria, Into It. Over It.) which built a comfortable setting to amplify the band's already superlative sound. [...] "I {{have been playing}} guitar in Hawthorne Heights with Micah live for around three years, and I knew we worked well together," [...] McMillon explains. [...] "Micah really pushed us to try some new things on this record that I think we were <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too <b>scared</b> to try on our own. Sometimes after being a band for so long, you feel almost stuck on how {{you are supposed to}} sound and what feels natural within the sound of your band. I think the end result was honest and pure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Partly so--they're bent {{on having}} him. He's {{in all the}} secrets of the anti-renters, and they're afraid for their very lives, so long as he's in your hands. Should he get <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>scared,</b> and give up only one-quarter of what he knows, there'd be no peace in the county for a twelvemonth." ...|$|E
60|$|She arrived punctually {{at eight}} o'clock next Sunday, {{carrying}} an exiguous green linen bag, which contained her dresses. She was subdued, and, now that {{it had come to}} the point, evidently <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>scared.</b> Lobster salad, hock, and peaches restored her courage. She ate heartily. It did not apparently matter to her whether she danced full or empty; but she would not smoke.|$|E
6000|$|The {{shepherd}} aroused {{them the}} next morning, {{as he had}} said. It was bright and clear, and the four miles to the train were accomplished pleasantly. When they had reached Melchester, {{and walked to the}} Close, and the gables of the old building in which she was again to be immured rose before Sue's eyes, she looked <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>scared.</b> [...] "I expect I shall catch it!" [...] she murmured.|$|E
5000|$|Rocky Dennis In Heaven is an EP by Swedish singer-songwriter Jens Lekman, {{released}} on 21 January 2004 on Service Records. The EP was later released as simply Rocky Dennis on Secretly Canadian Records. The songs on this EP {{can also be}} found on Lekman's 2005 release, Oh You're So Silent Jens. The Swedish release showed a sky blue cover with the words, [...] "Someday I'll be stuffed in <b>a</b> museum, <b>scaring</b> <b>little</b> kids With the inscription Carpe Diem, something I never did." ...|$|R
5000|$|The event {{called for}} two songs to be performed. The first song was only piano and vocalist. She {{walked out on}} the stage with her eyes closed, rehearsing what she had {{previously}} prepared. Paula was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>scared</b> but was very excited. Then {{she sat on the}} chairman. With determination and [...] "feeling", this girl performed the first few notes ... and nothing! The piano did not work! She felt like crying, {{she had no idea what}} to do, she could not believe what was happening. On the day of the contest the piano had decided to quit. Paula was just about to give up when she though maybe somehow they forgot to turn on, remembered just in time that there was a power switch. [...] "I reach over and switched it on and I had such an emotional start that it improved my [...] "performance", I made it through and I won the most important award in my life." ...|$|R
2500|$|She and Mia don't {{see eye to}} eye: Clarisse is {{concerned}} with attracting publicity to Genovia and ensuring Mia does not embarrass her country while Mia prefers to focus on politics. Though she and Mia butt heads often, she does care for her granddaughter and gives her advice about love and relationships that Mia takes {{with a grain of}} salt due to her grandmother's cold nature. For example, when Clarisse was married to the king of Genovia, she led him to believe that she was only interested in his status and money and never once said [...] "I love you", in order to keep her husband on his toes. Mia also mentions that her father is terrified of his mother because she would lock him in the palace dungeons whenever he misbehaved (although when she informs him that he gives the appearance of being <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>scared</b> of Clarisse in , her father replies that he is not scared of his mother and that she really isn't as bad as Mia thinks; in his view, Clarisse [...] "just needs proper handling").|$|R
60|$|MATEY. You won't {{know about}} razors, my lady, not being married--as yet--excuse me. But a married lady {{can tell a}} man's age {{by the number of}} his razors. (<b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>scared.)</b> If you saw his razors--there is a little world of them, from patents of the present day back to {{implements}} so horrible, you can picture him with them in his hand scraping his way through the ages.|$|E
60|$|They came in, looking <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>scared</b> {{and still}} holding {{one another by}} the hand. They wished the Professor good evening, and when he rose they backed away from him. The Professor shook hands with them, {{but they did not}} let go, so that Victoria gave him her right hand and Victor his left, and then at the Professor's {{invitation}} they sat themselves down on the extreme edge of the sofa.|$|E
60|$|At {{last the}} nurse came out, looking <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>scared,</b> {{to ask him}} to cycle three miles away and borrow some special sort of needle that the fool of a doctor had forgotten. He went, {{outwardly}} meek, and returning was met by the little interested servant, very alert and excited and rather superior--for here was something no man can do--with the news that he had a beautiful little daughter, and that all was well with Marjorie.|$|E
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} for Bend, Not Break was initially positive, with the Christian Science Monitor calling it an [...] "inspiring and energetic tale of how <b>a</b> <b>scared</b> <b>little</b> girl learned {{to draw down}} hard on her inner resources and build on every small kindness that came her way". The book has garnered positive reviews from Publishers Weekly, Kirkus Reviews, and Oprah.com, with the Oprah.com reviewer stating that it was [...] "devastating and transformative". A journalist for the China Daily heavily criticized the book, commenting that [...] "The book may have its truthful elements, but to most Chinese readers {{it seems that the}} majority of the facts have been bent too much to be believable." ...|$|R
5000|$|Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club {{gave this}} episode a [...] "B" [...] and wrote: [...] "Over {{the course of}} the episode, though, Louise shifts, first to her more {{familiar}} hellion role and then into what she fundamentally is, which is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> kid, and in this case <b>a</b> <b>scared</b> <b>little</b> kid. This is also a great episode for Louise being brutally honest in her comments and provoking similar candor right back: Look at how readily Bob admits that, yeah, being old is scary, or that the kids jumping out of a bunch of leaves was way more effective than his and Linda’s elaborate haunted house. Those exchanges would be amusing enough if they were just between two strangers, but it becomes properly hilarious because of our familiarity with Louise and Bob’s personalities, perspectives, and mannerisms, not to mention Schaal’s and H. Jon Benjamin’s performance." ...|$|R
50|$|The land of {{the queen}} is divided in two parts. At one side, there is a {{residential}} area which is overwhelmed by the mighty castle. On {{the other side is}} a dark forest named Unterwaldt. Both parts are only connected with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bridge over the river. One day Little Red Riding Hood is picking flowers at the border of the residential area. She sees a beautiful flower across the bridge and decides to enter Unterwaldt. The forest takes Little Red Riding Hood in its power and the girl forgets time. She decides to swim in the river, but suddenly a shark-fin appears. However, it is the hat of dwarf Bubi who spies on the woman. Bubi is attacked by <b>a</b> bear. <b>A</b> <b>scared</b> <b>Little</b> Red Riding Hood runs further into the forest. The bear takes Bubi to the cottage of the dwarves. It is revealed the bear is the disguised dwarf Tschakko. As Bubi looked at a woman, which is forbidden by the dwarves, he is punished. Squirrels tickle his feet until Bubi can't stop laughing.|$|R
