Methods: Catheters were placed into the intrathecal space of male Sprague-Dawley rats. Postoperative pain was evoked by an incision to the plantar {{surface of a}} hind paw. Withdrawal thresholds {{was used as a}} nociceptive parameter and was measured with a von Frey filament. After observing the effect of intrathecal ginsenosides, an alpha- 1 <b>adrenergic</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>antagonist</b> (prazosin), an alpha- 2 <b>adrenergic</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>antagonist</b> (yohimbine), a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist (atropine), and a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist (mecamylamine) were given 10 min before administration of the ginsenosides to analyze the contribution of spinal adrenergic and cholinergic receptors on the antinociceptive effect of ginsenosides. Results: Paw incision decreased withdrawal threshold in incised site of paw, but no change of withdrawal threshold was not seen in non-incised site. The intrathecal ginsenosides increased withdrawal threshold of the incised paw in a dose-dependent manner. Pre-treatment with both prazosin and intrathecal yohimbine antagonized the anti-nociceptive effect of the ginsenosides. However, pre-treatments with atropine or mecamylamine had any effect on the antinociceptive activity of ginsenosides.

40|$|The {{pharmacodynamic}} {{activities of}} two beta adrenergic antagonists, propranolol and practolol, were compared in eight hypertensive patients. The activity of each antagonist {{was established in}} relation to its blood concentration at maximal and submaximal adrenergic blockade defined by inhibition of exercise tachycardia. Maximal inhibition of exercise tachycardia was comparable with both drugs and averaged 74 ± 7 % of the control value during drug treatment. This inhibition was achieved with a blood concentration of 2. 5 ± 0. 4 μg/ml practolol and 0. 10 ± 0. 08 μg/ml propranolol. The antagonist activities of these drugs against adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol infusion indicated a much greater relative potency of propranolol against this stimulus, and in vivo estimates of PA 2 values differed by more than 600 -fold. Relative antagonist activity of practolol during isoproterenol stimulation was equivalent both at cardiac (inotropic and chronotropic) and at vascular <b>adrenergic</b> <b>receptors,</b> whereas greater <b>antagonist</b> activity of propranolol was observed at vascular receptors than at cardiac receptors. Thus, the activity of practolol {{was not limited to}} cardiac receptors as previously suggested.

Noradrenaline, adrenaline, isoproterenol and dopamine all inhibited the activation of spleen and thymus cells by concanavalin A, a T-cell specific mitogen, and the activation of spleen cells by lipopolysaccharide, a T-independent B-cell mitogen. The various catecholamines were approximately equipotent, having IC 50 of approximately 10 microM. alpha-adrenergic agonists (phenylephrine, clonidine) did not inhibit lymphocyte activation.

40|$|International audienceBot III neurotoxin is {{the most}} lethal α neurotoxin {{purified}} from Buthus occitanus tunetanus scorpion venom. This toxin binds to the voltage-gated sodium channel of excitable cells and blocks its inactivation, inducing an increased release of neurotransmitters (acetylcholine and catecholamines). This study aims to elucidate the involvement of cholinergic and adrenergic receptors in pathogenesis and inflammatory response triggered by this toxin. Injection of Bot III to animals induces an increase of peroxidase activities, an imbalance of oxidative status, tissue damages in lung parenchyma, and myocardium correlated with metabolic disorders. The pretreatment with nicotine (nicotinic receptor agonist) or atropine (muscarinic receptor antagonist) protected the animals from almost all disorders caused by Bot III toxin, especially the immunological alterations. Bisoprolol administration (selective β 1 <b>adrenergic</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>antagonist)</b> was also efficient in the protection of animals, mainly on tissue damage. Propranolol (non-selective <b>adrenergic</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>antagonist)</b> showed less effect. These results suggest that both cholinergic and adrenergic receptors are activated in the cardiopulmonary manifestations induced by Bot III. Indeed, the muscarinic receptor {{appears to be more}} involved than the nicotinic one, and the β 1 adrenergic receptor seems to dominate the β 2 receptor. These results showed also that the activation of nicotinic receptor leads to a significant protection of animals against Bot III toxin effect.

40|$|Background: Levosimendan and {{volatile}} anesthetics have myocardial pre-conditioning effects. beta- 1 <b>adrenergic</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>antagonists</b> may inhibit the protective effect of volatile anesthetics. No information exists {{as to whether}} this also applies to the pre-conditioning effect of levosimendan. We therefore investigated whether levosimendan added to metoprolol would demonstrate a cardioprotective effect. Methods: Three groups of anesthetized open chest pigs underwent 30 min of myocardial ischemia and 90 min of reperfusion by temporary occlusion of the largest side branch from the circumflex artery or the left anterior descending artery. One group (CTRL) served as a control, in another group (BETA), a metoprolol-loading dose was intravenously injected 30 min before ischemia, and in a third group (BETA+L), a levosimendan infusion was added to metoprolol. Myocardial tissue concentrations of glucose, glycerol, and lactate/pyruvate ratio as the primary end-points were investigated with microdialysis in ischemic and non-ischemic tissues. Results: At {{the end of the}} ischemic period, statistically significant differences were only found between CTRL and BETA+L in the ischemic myocardium, with a lower lactate/pyruvate ratio, lower glycerol, and higher glucose concentrations in BETA+L as compared with CTRL.

METHODS: First, amitriptyline was administered intraperitoneally (i. p.) at doses of 20, 40 and 80 mg kg- 1, 30 min before subplantar injection of carrageenan. Second, amitriptyline was given intracerebroventriculary or intrathecally at doses of 25, 50 and 100 &# 956;g/rat, 30 min prior to carrageenan challenge. Third, the effect of <b>adrenergic</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>antagonists</b> such as propranolol (10 mg kg- 1, i. p.), prazosin (4 mg kg- 1, i. p.) and yohimbine (10 mg kg- 1, i. p.) and an opioid <b>receptor</b> <b>antagonist</b> (naloxone, 4 mg kg- 1, i. p.) on the anti-inflammatory effect of amitriptyline (40 mg kg- 1, i. p.) was investigated. RESULTS: Our data confirm that intraperitoneally administered amitriptyline exhibits a marked anti-inflammatory effect on carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats 4 h postcarrageenan challenge (P < 0. 001). Intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) administration of amitriptyline also reduced the development of paw edema at 4 h postcarrageenan (P < 0. 001), but intrathecal (i. t.) application of amitriptyline failed to alter the degree of paw swelling. Furthermore, the applied antagonists did not modify the anti-inflammatory effect of amitriptyline. CONCLUSION: These results support the view that amitriptyline has a considerable anti-inflammatory effect on carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats and suggest that at least a part of this property could be mediated through supraspinal sites. Moreover, it seems unlikely that the investigated <b>adrenergic</b> and opioid <b>receptors</b> have a significant role in this effect of amitriptyline...|$|R
