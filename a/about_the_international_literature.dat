40|$|Purpose: To assess if {{it exists}} the close {{relationship}} suggested by some authors between open innovation and absorptive capacity. Design/methodology: Bibliometric {{analysis on the}} Web of Science <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>literature</b> where both terms are treated simultaneously. Findings: It {{has been shown that}} it is a field of growing interest {{and that there is a}} close relationship between open innovation and absorptive capacity. Research limitations/implications: The bias due to the database selected and the selection criteria applied (they could affect the no selection of some significant articles). Practical implications: To know that the absorption capacity is related to open innovation can help organizations become more innovative enhancing this capability. Originality/value: The approach used is a novelty and the conclusions can better understand the relationship between both terms (open innovation and absorption capacity). Thus, it can help increase innovation...|$|E
40|$|Social mix is a {{pressing}} issue for both researchers {{and policy makers}} in the western world. How can this be achieved and what effects can be expected for individuals {{as well as the}} wider society? A lot has been written <b>about</b> this in <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>literature</b> but less has been written on the Swedish case. The research that has been carried out for Sweden is often done on a very local scale or at a highly aggregated and statistical level. Few of these studies are concerned by the practical level of planning. The authors’ therefore saw a need for in-depth studies on the Swedish case and particular for studies at the intermediate municipal level. To capture the local perspectives on planning for social mix this interview study is targeting municipal planners and actors at the municipal owned housing companies in 31 of the largest cities in Sweden. The study aims to find out whether the policy goal of social mix, introduced in the 1970 s, still is relevant and how a planning for social mix can be done. What measures are used, what possibilities and difficulties are associated with social mix strategies? The authors begin with placing social mix as a policy goal in an international and historical perspective and this is followed by a discussion and presentation of the main results of the study in hand. In this report the authors’ conclude that social mix is a goal placed at the agenda although it might not be placed {{at the very top of}} the agenda. Further the physical restructuring of the housing stock is seen as the most important way to achieve social mix. They also conclude that the ability to achieve a social mix is to a great extent depending on the municipal housing companies and since their existence is questioned this makes this planning goal even more interesting to do further studies on...|$|R
