50|$|Quick {{couplers}} are devices {{installed at}} the outer end of the work equipment of various types of construction and earth-moving machines. They facilitate the rapid exchange of working tools or buckets. Quick couplers are most common on hydraulic excavators and compact excavators and on the backhoe equipment of backhoe loaders, but are also installed on telescopic handlers, wheel loaders (<b>loading</b> <b>shovels),</b> skid-steer loaders and the loader equipment of backhoe-loaders. They are also occasionally installed on attachments installed on agricultural tractors.Quick couplers do not normally have a specific function themselves in {{that they do not}} carry out handling or digging operations, but when installed on a machine they {{become a part of the}} overall system. They are usually mounted on the machine by means of the pins that would otherwise be the mountings for the bucket or attachment.This article concentrates on quick couplers installed on excavators and similar equipment.|$|R

Debswana continued its {{recovery from the}} labor unrest that had resulted in a 2-week strike in 2004. In 2005, Debswana treated about 31.2 million metric tons (Mt) of ore to yield 31890000 carat kg, which was a weight increase of more than 2% compared with 2004. Debswana’s diamond production included 148900000 carat kg from the 34-year-old Orapa Mine, which was a 7% decline compared with 2004; 15600000 carat kg from the 23-year-old Jwaneng Mine, which was a 14% increase compared with 2004; 1097000 carat kg from the 20-year-old Letlhakane Mine, which was a 6% increase compared with 2004; and 246278 carat kg from the 2-year-old Damtshaa Mine, which was a 27% decline from that of 2004.

40|$|This study {{considers}} {{load control}} in a multi-residential setup where energy scheduler (ES) devices installed in smart meters are employed for demand-side management (DSM). Several residential end-users {{share the same}} energy source and each residential user has non-adjustable <b>loads</b> and <b>adjustable</b> <b>loads.</b> In addition, residential users may have storage devices and renewable energy sources such as wind turbines or solar as well as dispatchable generators. The ES devices exchange information automatically by executing an iterative distributed algorithm to locate the optimal energy schedule for each end-user. This will reduce the total energy cost and the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) in energy demand in the electric power distribution. Users possessing storage devices and dispatchable generators strategically utilise their resources to minimise the total energy cost together with the PAR.

However, a proper evaluation of the technical specification of these small scale wind generators in various weather conditions is necessary in order to assess the full potential of benefits.

When first demonstrated in June 1929, the system had eight phase-shifting transformers to represent synchronous machines. Other elements included 100 variable line resistors, 100 variable reactors, 32 fixed capacitors, and 40 <b>adjustable</b> <b>load</b> units. The analyzer was described in a 1930 paper by H.L Hazen, O.R. Schurig and M.F. Gardner. The base quantities for the analyzer were 200 volts, and 0.5 amperes. Sensitive portable thermocouple-type instruments were used for measurement. The analyzer occupied four large panels, arranged in a U-shape, with tables {{in front of each}} section to hold measuring instruments. While primarily conceived as an educational tool, the analyzer saw considerable use by outside firms, who would pay to use the device. American Gas and Electric Company, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and many other organizations studied problems on the MIT analyzer in its first decade of operation. In 1940 the system was moved and expanded to handle more complex systems.|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} on an aqueous growth medium containing cultures of Escherichia coli (E. coli) XL 1 -Blue, to investigate, in a single experiment, the effect of two types of dynamic mechanical loading on cellular integrity. A bespoke shock tube was used to subject separate portions of a planktonic bacterial culture to two different loading sequences: (i) shock compression followed by cavitation, and (ii) shock compression followed by spray. The apparatus allows the generation of an <b>adjustable</b> <b>loading</b> shock wave of magnitude up to 300 MPa in a sterile laboratory environment. Cultures of E. coli were tested with this apparatus and the spread-plate technique {{was used to measure}} the survivability after mechanical loading. The loading sequence (ii) gave higher mortality than (i), suggesting that the bacteria are more vulnerable to shear deformation and cavitation than to hydrostatic compression.

30|$|Microgrid as an {{important}} part of smart grid comprises distributed generators (DGs), <b>adjustable</b> <b>loads,</b> energy storage systems (ESSs) and control units. It can be operated either connected with the external system or islanded with the support of ESSs. While the daily output of DGs strongly depends on the temporal distribution of natural resources such as wind and solar, unregulated electric vehicle (EV) charging demand will deteriorate the unbalance between the daily load curve and generation curve. In this paper, a statistic model is presented to describe daily EV charging/discharging behaviors considering the randomness of the initial state of charge (SOC) of EV batteries. The optimization problem is proposed to obtain the economic operation for the microgrid based on this model. In day-ahead scheduling, with the estimated power generation and load demand, the optimal charging/discharging scheduling of EVs during 24  h is achieved by serial quadratic programming. With the optimal charging/discharging scheduling of EVs, the daily load curve can better track the generation curve. The network loss in grid-connected operation mode and required ESS capacity in islanded operation mode are both decreased.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{influence}} of low power GaAsAl laser irradiation on the regeneration of a peripheral nerve, following a controlled crush injury. Material and methods: The right common fibular nerve of 30 Wistar rats was submitted to a crush injury with an <b>adjustable</b> <b>load</b> forceps (5 000 g, 10 minutes of application). The animals were divided into three groups (n= 10), according to the postoperative procedure (no irradiation; sham irradiation; effective irradiation). Laser irradiation (830 nm wave-length; 100 mW emission power; continuous mode; 140 J/cm(2)) was started on the first postoperative day and continued over 21 consecutive days. Body mass, time spent on the walking track and functional peroneal index (PFI) were analyzed based on the hind footprints, both preoperatively and on the 21 st postoperative day. Results: Walking time and PFI significantly improved in the group that received effective laser irradiation, despite the significant gain in body mass between the pre- and post-operative periods.

40|$|As a {{controllable}} subsystem integrating {{with the}} utility, a microgrid system consists of distributed energy sources, power conversion circuits, storage units and <b>adjustable</b> <b>loads.</b> Distributed energy sources employ non-polluted and sustainable {{resources such as}} wind and solar power in accordance with local terrain and climate to provide a reliable, consistent power supply for local customers. However, the electricity production in such a system is intermittent in nature, due to the time-varying weather conditions. Therefore, studies on accurate forecasting power generation and load demand are worthwhile {{in order to build}} a smart energy management system. The paper firstly reviews the forecasting algorithms for power supply side and load demand. The feasibly of the current control strategy is discussed.

With the approximate averaged model, an adaptive backstepping control with integral action is proposed to regulate a stand-alone buck DC-DC converter. This proposed control method has been verified by computer simulation and implemented utilizing a stand-alone digital signal processor (DSP) TMS 320 C 542 from Texas Instruments. Experimental results show that the proposed control method is capable of giving satisfactory voltage regulation performance under a wide range of input voltage variations and load changes...|$|R

Compared with the conventional “one time use” static load dispatch model, this dynamic feedback demand response model may adjust the load to a desired level in {{a finite number of}} time steps and a proof of convergence is provided. In addition, Monte Carlo simulation and boundary calculation using interval mathematics are applied for describing uncertainty of end-user's response to an independent system operator's expected dispatch. A numerical analysis based on the modified Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland power pool five-bus system is introduced for simulation and the results verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{framework}} for contingency management using smart loads, which are realized through the emerging paradigm of the Internet of Things. The framework involves the system operator, the load serving entities (LSEs), and the end-users with smart home management systems, that automatically control <b>adjustable</b> <b>loads.</b> The system operator uses an efficient linear equation solver to quickly calculate the load curtailment needed at each bus to relieve congested lines after contingencies. Given this curtailment request, an LSE calculates a power allowance for each of its end-use customers. We approximate this large-scale, NP-hard, problem to a convex optimization for efficient computation. A smart home management system determines the appliances allowed {{to be used in}} order to maximize the user’s utility within the power allowance given by the LSE. Since the users’ utility depends on the nearfuture utilization of the appliances, we propose the Welch-based Reactive Appliance Prediction (WRAP) algorithm to predict the user behavior and maximize utility. The proposed framework is validated using the New England 39 -bus test system. We show that power system components at risk can be quickly alleviated by adjusting a large number of small smart loads. Additionally, WRAP accurately predicts the users’ future behavior, minimizing the impact on their utility...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a new {{experimental}} technique for applying impulse tension loads. Briefly, the technique {{is based on the}} use of pulsed-magnetic-driven tension loading. Electromagnetic forming (EMF) can be quite effective in increasing the forming limits of metal sheets, such as aluminium and magnesium alloys. Yet, why the forming limit is increased is still an open question. One reason for this is the difficulty to let forming proceed on a certain influence monotonically: the main phenomena causing this increase in formability are considered to due to “body force” effect, inertia effect, changes in strain rate sensitivity. In this study, an impulse tension loading setup is presented. “Body force” effect and strain rate, which are known to be the two key factors leading to higher formability, can now be separated freely by our designed device. Reproducible and <b>adjustable</b> <b>loading</b> rate (80 s- 1 ~ 3267 s- 1) can be achieved by adjusting the discharge voltage and capacitance. The relation between the discharge voltage and strain rate was obtained with the help of finite element calculations and high-camera measurement results.

It shows that this technique could be used to study the dynamic response of sheets...|$|R
40|$|Restricted until 24 May. 2011. A typical tissue {{engineering}} approach involves combining three elements: a tissue scaffold, living cells, and cell signaling molecules, to regenerate a damaged tissue or organ. Tissue scaffold is the emerging key technology for {{tissue engineering}} applications. In this study, silane (glycidoxypropyltrimethoxy silane, GPMS) containing an epoxide {{group has been}} employed to crosslink gelatin and improve its deficient properties. However, GPMS modified gelatin has lower elasticity and hydrophobic structure due to its dense structure. These drawbacks were solved {{with the use of}} fructose as a spacer and another silane containing amine groups (aminopropyltriethoxysilane, APES) for the formation of longer bridge between two silanes. Furthermore, an “optimum” 2 D or 3 D silane-crosslinked system showed more wettable IPN structure due to many organic functional groups on its surface which can support cell attachment, migration and proliferation and allow interactions with biomolecules such as growth factors, providing lower toxicity. When silane modified gelatin(GS) was introduced to hydroxyapatite(HA) as a coating material, it yielded greater compressive strength and optimized the release of growth factors and stimulated osteogenic differentiation in vivo and in vitro. Also, GS, working as a DBM carrier, significantly enhanced the characteristics of DBM with <b>adjustable</b> <b>load</b> resistance, while maintaining the innate osteogenic properties of DBM.
