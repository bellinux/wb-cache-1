5|$|Forecasters {{subsequently}} {{decided to}} continue with the current practice of naming hurricanes after women, but developed <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>set</b> of names ahead of the 1955 season with the names Carol, Edna and Hazel retired for the next ten years.

During 1959 the US Pacific Command Commander in Chief and the Joint Chiefs of Staff decided that the various US Navy and Air Force weather units would become one unit based on Guam entitled the Fleet Weather Central/Joint Typhoon Warning Center, which continued naming the systems for the Pacific basin.|$|E
