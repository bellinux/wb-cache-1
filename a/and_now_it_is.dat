Anti-miscegenation laws (laws banning interracial marriages) were abolished in the United States in 1967 <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> estimated that one-fifth of the population in the United States by 2050 {{will be part of the}} polyethnic population. In 2000, self-identified Multiracial Americans numbered 6.8 million or 2.4% of the population.|$|E

The dish has been served at several fairs in the United States; among them, the State Fair of Texas in Dallas, Texas, and the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines, Iowa; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> served worldwide. It has a significant buttery flavor, which {{has been compared to}} that of French toast. Fried butter is a similar dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Ocepeia is {{from the}} Paleocene of Morocco's Ouled Abdoun Basin, {{although}} its fossils were initially thought to be earliest Ypresian (early Eocene) in age. That age has been revised, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> known that O. daouiensis comes from the same bone bed that is dated to the Selandian age of the Paleocene (59-60 MYA), which also yields Eritherium, Abdounodus, and Lahimia. O. grandis is slightly younger (more recent) in age, occurring in the Thanetian bone bed of the same area. Its larger size and younger age suggest {{it is in the}} same evolutionary lineage as O. daouiensis. The area of western Morocco during the late Cretaceous through the Eocene consisted of warm, shallow inland seas, where the ancient Tethys Ocean met the Atlantic Ocean, and during which phosphate deposits and associated fossils accumulated over some 25 million years.|$|E

Post-independence, Gwalior has emerged as an important tourist attraction in central India while many industries and administrative offices came up within the city. Before the end of the 20th century it became a million plus agglomeration <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a metropolitan city in central India. Gwalior is surrounded by industrial and commercial zones of neighbouring districts (Malanpur – Bhind, Banmor – Morena) on all three main directions. A 2016 report of the World Health Organization found Gwalior to be the second-most air-polluted city {{in the world and the}} most polluted city in India.|$|E
25|$|Classical Greek {{geometry}} {{defined the}} Euclidean plane and Euclidean three-dimensional space using certain postulates, {{while the other}} properties of these spaces were deduced as theorems. Geometric constructions are also used to define rational numbers. When algebra and mathematical analysis became developed enough, this relation reversed <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> more common to define Euclidean space using Cartesian coordinates and the ideas of analytic geometry. It means that points of the space are specified with collections of real numbers, and geometric shapes are defined as equations and inequalities. This approach brings the tools of algebra and calculus to bear on questions of geometry and has the advantage that it generalizes easily to Euclidean spaces of more than three dimensions.|$|E

25|$|In {{second half}} of 2008 the Solaris Urbino 18 Hybrid model went through several levels of {{modernisation}} <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> considered {{to be at the}} second generation by the producer. Most of the changes are that of the power system of the electric hybrid engine, making a smaller and lighter engine, the Cummins ISBe5 250B with a volume of 6.7litre and the power of 178kW. The changes meant even lower fuel consumption - the older engine has reduced fuel usage by 15% compared to purely diesel propulsion while the new engine saves 23-24%. Thanks to further optimisation the Solaris is planning to reduce fuel consumption by 30%. Due to a lighter engine, the other power systems, like the batteries and Dual Power Inverter Module which are on the roof, work at an increased rate and produce more power. Due to this the model has also undergone a makeover of the general body, such as the aerodynamics, meaning only an air conditioning module can be fitted {{on the front of the}} bus. The estimated time for future modernisation, when new modules will be able to be added, is said to be about in 6–7 years, with an average usage of 60000km per year.|$|E

It was a special staff roll for a special moment. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> gone. All of it. ...It's incredibly disappointing and sad." [...] A Capcom representative stated that the credits, a pre-rendered movie, had the Clover Studio logo within it, and they had [...] "no legal right to use the Clover logo in a game they were not involved with directly". Since they also lacked the source to the credits, they opted to remove them entirely from the game. Ready at Dawn's co-founder Didier Malenfant also claimed that the Wii version of Ōkami took up much more space on the game media than the PlayStation 2 version, and that the movie was cut in order to fit everything on a single game disk, however despite these claims, the credit sequence was restored in the Japanese release of the Wii version and revealed that the port was co-developed by Tose, having provided additional planners, designers, programmers and test players. The images from the credits, although not the credits themselves, are still available as unlockable art.|$|E
