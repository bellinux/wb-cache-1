5|$|In March 1948 Rau became {{chairman}} of the German Economic Commission (Deutsche Wirtschaftskommission or DWK), which during this period became the centralised <b>administrative</b> <b>organisation</b> for the Soviet Occupation Zone and the predecessor of the future East German government. The organisation existed {{during a time of}} very difficult challenges coming from different sides. A particularly momentous event during this time was the currency reform of 1948. On 20June 1948 the western German zones introduced a new currency, leaving the eastern zone to use the old common currency. In order to avoid inflation, the DWK under Rau's leadership, was forced to follow quickly with its own reform and issued an own currency too. In doing so, the DWK also exploited the currency reform to redistribute capital by using different exchange rates for private and state-run companies. The disagreement, which of the two new currencies should be used in Berlin, triggered the Berlin Blockade by the USSR and the western airborne supply of West Berlin.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of the Bosnian War, the government of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Srpska Republika Bosna i Hercegovina; renamed as Republika Srpska in August 1992) decided on 31May 1992 to establish the Archives of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was to be a state-owned public institution with its headquarters in Sarajevo. On 15September 1992, the National Assembly of Republika Srpska decided that the Archives of Republika Srpska be an <b>administrative</b> <b>organisation</b> of the republic. However, the decision on the establishment of the Archives with its headquarters in Sarajevo was never realised, and the archival activities in Republika Srpska continued to be carried out by the Archives of Bosanska Krajina and the regional archives of Doboj and Foča. The Law on Ministries passed by the National Assembly of Republika Srpska on 11September 1993 defined the Archives of Republika Srpska as an <b>administrative</b> <b>organisation</b> of the republic responosible for the archival activities on its territory, headquartered in Banja Luka and with its regional offices in Doboj and Foča. The new archival legislation augmented the one passed in 1987. The first director of the Archives of Republika Srpska was Nebojša Radmanović. During the war, the Archives organised two exhibitions and provided continuous services to students and researchers. Fifty-three researchers used the Archives in 1995, the last year of the war. At that time, it had 18 employees. The Archives was later placed under the Ministry of Education and Culture of the Government of Republika Srpska. The Archives' regional offices in Zvornik and Trebinje were established in 2001, and its regional office in Sokolac was established in 2008.|$|E

The movement of the infantry across Sinai was eased by construction of wire netting roads also used by Egyptian Labour Corps, light vehicles, cars, and ambulances. This reasonably stable surface, which did not sink, was constructed from two or four rolls of rabbit wire; one inch mesh wire rolled out side by side, wired together with the edges fixed into the sand with long steel or wooden pegs to produce a reasonable track.|$|E
25|$|The Tribal Hidage is {{evidence}} {{of the existence of}} numerous smaller provinces, meaning that southern and eastern Britain may have lost any macro-political cohesion in the fifth and sixth centuries and fragmented into many small autonomous units, though late Roman <b>administrative</b> <b>organisation</b> of the countryside may have helped dictate their boundaries. By the end of the sixth century the leaders of these communities were styling themselves kings, with the majority of the larger kingdoms based on the south or east coasts. They include the provinces of the Jutes of Hampshire and Wight, the South Saxons, Kent, the East Saxons, East Angles, Lindsey and (north of the Humber) Deira and Bernicia. Several of these kingdoms may have their foundation the former Roman civitas and this has been argued as particularly likely for the provinces of Kent, Lindsey, Deira and Bernicia, all of whose names derive from Romano-British tribal or district names.|$|E

In all it contains around 150 alleged documents, including 68 letters, 60 speeches and proposals to the people or the senate, and 20 senatorial decrees and acclamations. Records like these are quite distinct from the rhetorical speeches often inserted by ancient historians – it was accepted practice for the writer to invent these himself – and on the few occasions when historians (such as Sallust in his work on Catiline or Suetonius in his Twelve Caesars) include such documents, they have generally been regarded as genuine; [...] but almost all those found in the Historia Augusta have been rejected as fabrications, partly on stylistic grounds, partly because they refer to military titles or points of <b>administrative</b> <b>organisation</b> which are otherwise unrecorded until long after the purported date, or for other suspicious content.|$|E

One of MacArthur's first orders to Brett was for a bombing mission to the Philippines, an order which was delivered personally by MacArthur's chief of staff, Major General Richard K. Sutherland. Brett protested that his planes were worn out, his men were tired, losses might be high, and the Philippines were lost anyway. Sutherland told him the MacArthur wanted the mission carried out. Brett delegated it to Brigadier General Ralph Royce, who led the mission in person. Brett awarded Royce the Distinguished Service Cross. Henceforth, communications with Sutherland would be handled by Brett's chief of staff, Air Vice Marshal William Bostock. MacArthur personally wrote a reprimand to Brett. Further disagreements between MacArthur and Brett followed. On 6 July 1942 Marshall radioed MacArthur to offer him Major General George Kenney or Brigadier General Jimmy Doolittle {{as a replacement for}} Brett. MacArthur selected Kenney.
