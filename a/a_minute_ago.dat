2500|$|When Neff {{learns that}} Keyes {{suspects}} Nino of being Phyllis' accomplice, Neff sees {{a way out}} of his predicament. He arranges to meet Phyllis at her house. He informs her that he knows about her involvement with Nino, and guesses that she is planning to have Nino kill him. He tells her that he intends to kill her and put the blame on Nino. She is prepared, however, and shoots him in the shoulder. Seriously wounded but still standing, he slowly comes closer and dares her to shoot again. She does not, and he takes the gun from her. She says she never loved him [...] "until <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>ago,</b> when I couldn't fire that second shot." [...] Neff does not believe a word she says, and as she hugs him tightly, Neff says, [...] "Goodbye, baby," [...] and shoots twice, killing her.|$|E
60|$|MRS BUILDER. I {{must tell}} you that I {{happened}} to look in <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'You didn't say {{she said}} that <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>ago,</b> said Painted Jaguar, sucking the prickles out of his paddy-paw. 'You said she said {{something}} quite different.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{turned and}} faced me. He was {{certainly}} paler {{than he had}} been <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|R
60|$|Yes, sir. She came <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> <b>ago,</b> {{with her}} little boy. They are with Mrs. Starkweather.|$|R
6000|$|His cousin {{shook her}} head mournfully. [...] "And <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> I was nearly observing that you had lost your sense of humour!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You ain't seen me cash in any chips or call a turn since I {{told you}} I was broke, <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>ago,</b> have you? Friend, chase {{yourself}} away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{reckoned}} <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>ago</b> {{there was}} a sick gal in the house! Who's {{going to make a}} row now! Who's going to stamp and tear round, eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't--to that extent, Aunt Patsy. I {{was glad}} the {{drowning}} was postponed <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>ago,</b> but I'm not now. No, {{that is all}} gone by; I want to be drowned." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Just <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> <b>ago,</b> as you {{hid behind}} your status like a coward, you made {{comments}} about me that were both unjust and unjustified." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{picked up}} a funny-colored bean and ate it, <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> <b>ago.</b> Queer flavor it had, too. Nothing else that I can think of." ...|$|R
6000|$|COLONEL, to Steve, who {{is indeed}} the more bewildered of the two, 'And <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> I assure you she was weeping on my shoulder!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it is, indeed," [...] said Mary Louise, panting {{a little}} from her run. [...] "I saw you throw things, <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>ago,</b> so I guess {{you mean to}} run away." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{moment was}} almost breathless in its emotion. Forgotten the faint creakings, the {{imagined}} noises of <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>ago.</b> None {{of them had}} eyes for anything but what Jane held in her hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have {{you gone}} to bed, Jean? Some one is {{knocking}} at the door, and <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>ago</b> I thought I heard a carriage stop close by. Perhaps the farmer has driven Mr. Dishart home." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{that had}} {{happened}} <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> in the blueberry patch seemed a far-off dream; the reality had died out of the looks and words.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a pity {{you were}} not here <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> <b>ago.</b> I have just bought a picture. You might have put the thing through for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{will not}} be there at all this evening," [...] the porter answered. [...] "The second maitre d'hotel was here <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> <b>ago,</b> and told me so himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I said, [...] "he {{was here}} <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>ago,</b> and I saw him follow a gentleman away. I think I could find him {{for you if}} you would like me to try." ...|$|E
6000|$|ANNA--[With {{an exasperated}} laugh.] Gee, won't you ever can that stuff? [CHRIS relapses into injured silence. After a pause ANNA {{continues}} curiously.] You said <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>ago</b> you'd fixed something up--about me. What was it? ...|$|E
60|$|I {{hoped for}} a letter, and thought I had one when the mail was handed in, <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>ago,</b> {{but it was only}} that note from Sylvester Baxter. You must write--do you hear?--or I will be remiss myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "We don't know," [...] replied Paul. [...] "We {{just got}} back from the river <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> and found the barn door broken open and both horses gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... {Margaret}, <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> <b>ago,</b> {{when you}} told me there was nothing between you and this man, you lied to me--lied to me as only a wicked woman can lie.|$|R
60|$|She {{smiled a}} little half-heartedly. It was curious that she found herself {{contrasting}} for a moment this very elegant young man with her roughly dressed companion of <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|R
60|$|MY DEAR MOTHER AND SISTER,--11 O'clock at night.--This is the infernalist darkest country, {{when the}} moon don't shine; I {{stumbled}} and fell over my horse's lariat <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>ago</b> and hurt my leg, so I must stay here tonight.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{took it out}} <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>ago,</b> {{and went}} off with it to put a ribbon on it, or some such notion," [...] replied Jo, dancing about the room {{to take the first}} {{stiffness}} off the new army slippers.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, are you going?' {{said the}} stout man, {{looking up from}} the ground where he was lying at his ease, into her grandfather's face. 'You were in a mighty hurry <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>ago.</b> Go, if you like. You're your own master, I hope?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was sitting}} in my garden <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> <b>ago,</b> having <b>a</b> pipe before {{finishing}} {{the rest of my}} papers, and Wyatt dropped from the wall on to my herbaceous border." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is I--Arnold Chetwode," [...] Arnold answered. [...] "I am {{speaking}} {{from the office}} in the city. I heard some news <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> which I thought might interest you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] he said, [...] "I did {{not know}} you were here until <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> and I will not keep you now. I think the Señora is waiting for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{was here}} <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>ago.</b> He's {{been talking with}} some of the deck {{passengers}} that are going home because they couldn't get on in America. Doesn't that seem pitiful, poppa? I always thought we had work enough for the whole world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sure I don't {{know what}} I do want now. I {{had made up}} my mind <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>ago,</b> and now it's all gone again--oh yes, I remember, the red. Yes, I'll have the red. No, I don't mean the red, I mean the grey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, Peterkin, {{we shall}} see," [...] {{returned}} Jack, halting under {{the shade of}} a cocoa-nut tree. [...] "You said you were thirsty just <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>ago.</b> Now jump up that tree and bring down a nut--not a ripe one; bring a green, unripe one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're all right," [...] {{repeated}} Bill. [...] "One good turn deserves another, Tom. You {{saved my}} life <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> <b>ago,</b> and now I've hauled you out o' the water, old boy." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{turned away}} with a little sigh. The tragedy which <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> she had seen looming up, eluded her. She had courted a dénouement in vain. He was too clever.|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw {{you come}} in here <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> and I followed, because I want to speak to you," [...] said Andy, shoving to the front and eyeing the fellow closely.|$|R
