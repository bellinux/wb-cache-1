5|$|Cone {{production}} varies a {{great deal}} from year to year, but, as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> low flowering rate, is generally very low. However, there are typically a very high number of follicles per cone, leading to relatively high seed counts. There is some seed predation, primarily from the curculionid weevil Cechides amoenus.|$|E

Sales amounted to $800 million a year as of 2010, with a media budget of nearly $200 million and $12–15 million for celebrity fees. The product is mostly sold online as part of a continuity program. A month after ordering, customers are sent a three-month supply, which continues until the subscription is cancelled. Customers have complained that the subscriptions are hard to cancel.|$|E
5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> extreme {{rarity in}} nature, most {{francium}} is synthesised {{in the nuclear}} reaction 197Au + 18O → 210Fr + 5 n, yielding francium-209, francium-210, and francium-211. The greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is about 300,000 neutral atoms, which were synthesised using the nuclear reaction given above. When the only natural isotope francium-223 is specifically required, it is produced as the alpha daughter of actinium-227, itself produced synthetically from the neutron irradiation of natural radium-226, one of the daughters of natural uranium-238.|$|E

50|$|C. difficile is {{actually}} quite common in the human digestive system. However, C. difficile is a poor competitor, and is often out competed by other bacteria for nutrients in the digestive system. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>result,</b> C. difficile is kept to a manageable amount.

It is more chemically similar to aluminium than its close neighbors in the periodic table due to having a similar charge-to-radius ratio.|$|E

5|$|HIV {{differs from}} many viruses {{in that it}} has very high genetic variability.

5|$|In 1887, English mycologists Miles Joseph Berkeley and Christopher Edmund Broome {{described}} {{a species of}} fungus they named Tympanis toomansis, collected from dead infructescences ("cones") of Banksia growing {{on the banks of}} the Tooma River in southern New South Wales, Australia. Its generic placement was <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> resemblance to Tympanis, a genus in the family Helotiaceae of the Ascomycota.|$|E

40|$|Abstract An {{essential}} {{step for}} accurate protein synthesis {{is the right}} placement of mRNA and tRNA in the initiation complex 30 S. In prokaryotes system, this process requires three initiation factors: IF 1, IF 2, and IF 3. The biggest of these three factors is IF 2, a GTP/GDP binding protein of 63 Kd (in Thermus thermophilus) that catalyzes the binding of initiator fMet-tRNA in the ribosomal P site in frame with mRNA. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> activity the rate of translation initiation is increased and its fidelity is assured. Despite the structure {{of all the other}} prokaryotic translation initiation factors have been resolved (IF 1, Sette et al. 1997; IF 3, Biou et al. 1995), as well as elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G in various functional states (Kjeldgaar...|$|R

In fact, M-123 has three intersections with only two state trunklines; it meets M-28 twice as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> U-shaped routing. M-123 also has a rare signed concurrency with a County-Designated Highway in Michigan; in Trout Lake, there is a concurrency with H-40.
