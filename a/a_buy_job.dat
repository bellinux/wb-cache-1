50|$|Frieda Mueller {{was born}} in October 1873. When she was young, her family moved from Hoboken, New Jersey to Cincinnati, Ohio. She met flautist Charles Loehmann {{at the age of}} 19 and the pair married in the early 1890s. After his flute-playing career ended due to lip paralysis, he opened a {{haberdashery}} and Frieda had her first experience merchandising. The business did well at first, but went into bankruptcy following a move. In 1916, Frieda took <b>a</b> <b>buying</b> <b>job</b> in New York and the family moved to Brooklyn. She got the idea to sell samples and surplus apparel at discount prices and in 1920 started the first Loehmann's store in their Brooklyn home.|$|R
50|$|In {{standard}} neoclassical economics, {{people are}} assumed to be rational; the notion of systematic bias {{is considered to be a}} sloppy assumption. In many ways, Caplan agrees: most people are rational when it comes to choosing <b>a</b> <b>job,</b> <b>buying</b> milk, hiring employees, and selecting a business strategy. They can be wrong, of course, but a systematic bias rarely, if ever, occurs.|$|R
50|$|Identity {{scores are}} also much more mutable and “fuzzy” than credit scores, because the source information—public records and {{personally}} identifying information—is constantly changing. Every time an individual changes <b>a</b> <b>job,</b> <b>buys</b> or sells property, or has {{an encounter with}} law enforcement, their public records are altered. Coordinating the information across so many different sources makes {{it very difficult to}} fix errors in one’s information once they occur.|$|R
50|$|At this point, all of {{the young}} men {{returning}} from World War II were looking for places to settle down, find <b>a</b> <b>job,</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> home, and raise their families. Roland Federspiel formed a partnership with Glenn Ahlstrom and a contractor named Jacobsen to build homes on land that had previously been vineyards. Up until that point after the War, there had not been any production housing in the United States. Homes had been constructed individually or in small numbers.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{areas that}} seemed {{simplest}} and cleanest {{was to go}} back to those high-concept 1960s sitcoms and say let's do them for real," [...] Johnson said. The Simple Life was inspired by Green Acres, a sitcom about a New York society couple who moved to a farm. Johnson said they originally thought of moving an entire family to the South. Cameras would observe as the former socialites, deprived of access to their bank accounts and Beemers, attempt to get <b>a</b> <b>job,</b> <b>buy</b> groceries, and fit in with average Americans.|$|R
50|$|Occupational {{inequality}} greatly {{affects the}} socioeconomic status {{of an individual}} which is linked with their access to resources like finding <b>a</b> <b>job,</b> <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> house, etc. If an individual experiences occupational inequality, {{it may be more}} difficult for them to find a job, advance in their job, get <b>a</b> loan or <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> house. Occupational standing can lead to predictions of outcomes such as social standing and wealth which have long-lasting effects on the individual as well as their dependents. Segregation by gender in the labor force is extremely high, hence the reason why there remain so many disparities and inequalities among men and women of equitable qualifications. The division of labor is a central feature for gender based inequality. It influences the structure both based on its economic aspects and construction of identities. However, studies show that the general overall picture of gender and labor has not been evaluated. The importance of these issues is pertinent for the future structure of our labor force.|$|R
30|$|A {{possible}} explanation for this puzzle, at least for large firms, might be that stable firms tend to be low-wage firms and high-wage workers can afford to <b>buy</b> <b>job</b> security by choosing permanent and long-lasting jobs in those stable firms (Cornelißen and Hüber 2011).|$|R

Talking storks. A mover with a panty fetish. A bus driver named The Tip. And while they're all chasing him, he's running after his ex-girlfriend, {{trying to get her}} back in the hopes that {{everyone}} else will go away. Around and around they go. And if Tommy stops he won't be able to say no. If he stops moving he'll have to settle down. Get <b>a</b> real <b>job.</b> <b>Buy</b> <b>a</b> house. Get a bank loan to pay off renovations on a deck. Have a kid, raise it, and watch the whole process begin again. The cast of characters wants to make sure this happens. Tommy's a disruption to their ordered lives. He has to be assimilated back into the system before anyone else begins to question their role. They must get Tommy. So Tommy has to keep moving. He stumbles through conversations. Falls on his face. Gets lost. But still he keeps moving. Stuck in a surrealist world that is a modern day city, however chalk full of over-the-top citizens. The chase is on...|$|R

The parties routinely exchange party funds for favours or pay them out because of extortion.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} second-price, sealed-bid auctions with <b>a</b> <b>buy</b> price where bidders' {{types are}} discretely distributed. We characterize all equilibria in which bidders whose types {{are less than}} the buy price bid their own valuations. Budish and Takeyama (2001) analyze the two-bidder, two-type framework. They show that if bidders are risk-averse, then the seller can obtain a higher expected revenue from the auction with <b>a</b> certain <b>buy</b> price than from the auction without <b>a</b> <b>buy</b> price. We extend their revenue improvement result to the n-bidder, two-type framework. In case of three or more types, however, bidders' risk aversion is not a sufficient condition for a revenue improvement. We point out that even if bidders are risk-averse, the seller cannot always obtain a higher expected revenue from the auctions with <b>a</b> <b>buy</b> price. Auction Buy price Risk aversion...|$|R
