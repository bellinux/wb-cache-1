5|$|On 11 February 2008 the Australian Family Association (AFA), was {{publicly}} {{outraged that}} Underbelly would be screening at 8:30pm, well {{within reach of}} children, after clips of the series were leaked onto the internet. The clips highlighted the use of extreme profanities, and scenes that show a violent bashing, <b>a</b> <b>cold-blooded</b> murder, and a sexual encounter. The Nine Network defended the timeslot and the M classification, saying the clips, leaked from the Network's production department, were indeed from the series, {{but not all of}} them made the final cut. The Network set its own classification, under the accepted rules of the Australian Commercial Television Code of Conduct. The Australian Family Association threatened to take the matter to Communications Minister Stephen Conroy if the content of the show was anything near that of an unauthorised promotional clip leaked from Nine's production department.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{the case}} did not quickly fade. The play Maria Marten, or The Murder in the Red Barn existed in various {{anonymous}} versions; it was a sensational hit throughout the mid 19th century {{and may have been}} the most performed play of the time. Victorian fairground peep shows were forced to add extra apertures for their viewers when exhibiting their shows of the murder. The plays of the Victorian era tended to portray Corder as <b>a</b> <b>cold-blooded</b> monster and Maria as the innocent whom he preyed upon; her reputation and her children by other fathers were airbrushed out, and Corder was made into an older man. Charles Dickens published an account of the murder in his magazine All the Year Round after initially rejecting it because he felt the story to be too well known and the account of the stepmother's dreams rather far-fetched.|$|E

5|$|Audie Murphy (20 June 1925 – 28 May 1971) was {{a highly}} {{decorated}} American soldier and Medal of Honor recipient who turned actor. He portrayed himself in the film To Hell and Back, the account of his World War II experiences. During the 1950s and 1960s he was cast primarily in westerns. While often the hero, he proved his ability to portray <b>a</b> <b>cold-blooded</b> hired gun in No Name on the Bullet. A notable exception to the westerns was The Quiet American in which he co-starred with Michael Redgrave. Murphy made over 40 feature films and often worked with directors more than once. Jesse Hibbs who directed To Hell and Back worked with the star on six films, only half of which were westerns. When promoting his 1949 book To Hell and Back he appeared on the radio version of This Is Your Life. To promote the 1955 film of the same name, he appeared on Ed Sullivan's Toast of the Town. He was a celebrity guest on television shows such as What's My Line? and appeared {{in a handful of}} television dramas. Murphy's only television series Whispering Smith had a brief run in 1961. For his cooperation in appearing in the United States Army's Broken Bridge episode of The Big Picture television series he was awarded the Outstanding Civilian Service Medal.|$|E

40|$|The {{amphibians}} are {{the first}} tetrapods and therefore occupy a phylogenetic position of great interest. <b>As</b> <b>cold-blooded</b> vertebrates, amphibians are greatly susceptible to environmental fluctuations. In fact, most of the anurans and urodeles exhibit a markedly seasonal testicular cycle (circannual) (Lofts, 1974; Rastogi, 1976; Rastogi et al., 1978, 1983). Among environmental factors involved in the amphibian breeding cycle the most relevant are the photoperiod and the temperature.

Unlike other characters, Prince appears in both films. Prince is portrayed as <b>a</b> <b>cold-blooded</b> killer who attacks people for merely insulting him. Throughout the film he employs intelligence and wit to overcome his enemies; for example, he makes a deal with Contention's sheriffs with promises to spare them only to kill them after all, and he turns the whole city of Contention against its lawmen by promoting a reward of $200 for everyone who can kill even a single of Wade's captors. After Evans gets Wade on the train to Yuma, Charlie pursues on foot, but is {{shot and killed by}} Evans; the rest of the gang quickly gives up the chase.|$|E

Benjamin's family flees Charlotte's plantation as it is burned {{to live in a}} Gullah settlement with former black slaves. There, Gabriel marries his betrothed Anne. Tavington's brigade rides into the town that supplies the militia. He assembles all the townspeople, including Anne, into the church promising freedom in exchange for the whereabouts of the rebels. However, after the location is given the doors are barricaded, trapping the people as Tavington orders the church burned, killing them all in <b>a</b> <b>cold-blooded</b> act of genocide.

25|$|Sustained speed may be {{estimated}} by calculating the drag of a simplified {{model of the}} body, that can be approached by a prolate spheroid, and the sustainable level of energy output by the muscles. A first study of this problem was published by Judy Massare in 1988. Even when assuming a low hydrodynamic efficiency of 0.65, Massare's model seemed to indicate that plesiosaurs, if warm-blooded, would have cruised at a speed of four metres per second, or about fourteen kilometres per hour, considerably exceeding the known speeds of extant dolphins and whales. However, in 2002 Ryosuke Motani showed that the formulae that Massare had used, had been flawed. A recalculation, using corrected formulae, resulted in a speed of half a metre per second (1.8km/h) for <b>a</b> <b>cold-blooded</b> plesiosaur and {{one and a half}} metres per second (5.4km/h) for an endothermic plesiosaur. Even the highest estimate is about a third lower than the speed of extant Cetacea.|$|E
25|$|Óscar Malherbe de León {{was born}} in Mexico on 10 January 1964. Before joining the drug trade, he was a shoeshiner and a car washer for several local drug lords. He then turned to car theft and was later {{recruited}} by the crime boss Casimiro Espinoza Campos (alias El Cacho) in 1976 and join the Gulf Cartel. Espinoza Campos headed a criminal cell in Matamoros that oversaw the area's auto theft industry, drug trafficking rings, protection rackets, and the cartel's score-settlings. By the 1980s, Malherbe's notoriety within the Gulf Cartel grew because he proved to be <b>a</b> <b>cold-blooded</b> and cunning assassin. At the age of 22, he was indicted by the Public Ministry of Matamoros (Spanish: Ministerio Público de Matamoros) and was alleged to {{have been involved in}} at least 10 homicides from 1983 to 1984. The name of the late Luis Medrano García, another leader in the Gulf Cartel arrested in 1993 in Ciudad Juárez, also appeared in the indictment. Medrano and Malherbe usually worked together by supervising the drug trafficking shipments in the corridor of Matamoros, Tamaulipas. Both of them had from six to eight armed henchmen watching their backs inside a walled compound from where they hid and gave orders.|$|E

500|$|Foster et al. {{argue that}} it is {{unlikely}} there were two incidents, a shooting that was investigated, and a poisoning that was not, because Brown's appearance before the court is common to both stories, but is known to have only occurred {{in the case of the}} shooting murders.

This transformation included the morphing of <b>a</b> <b>cold-blooded</b> shooting into a sly and passive [...] "set and forget" [...] poisoning, where the Aboriginal victims are [...] "complicit in their own demise" [...] by stealing the flour. They arrive at the judgement that, by focussing on a poisoning rather than a shooting, the story plays down the seriousness of the crime. Further, they observe that the murder of Aboriginal people effectively became a plot device, while the horse ride became central to the legend.
