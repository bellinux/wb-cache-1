5|$|Anomalous X-ray {{scattering}} (MAD or SAD phasing)– the X-ray wavelength may be scanned past an <b>absorption</b> <b>edge</b> of an atom, which {{changes the}} scattering in a known way. By recording full sets of reflections at three different wavelengths (far below, far above {{and in the}} middle of the <b>absorption</b> <b>edge)</b> one can solve for the substructure of the anomalously diffracting atoms and hence the structure of the whole molecule. The most popular method of incorporating anomalous scattering atoms into proteins is to express the protein in a methionine auxotroph (a host incapable of synthesizing methionine) in a media rich in seleno-methionine, which contains selenium atoms. A MAD experiment can then be conducted around the <b>absorption</b> <b>edge,</b> which should then yield the position of any methionine residues within the protein, providing initial phases.|$|E
5|$|The intensities of the {{reflections}} observed in X-ray diffraction {{give us the}} magnitudes |F(q)| but not the phases φ(q). To obtain the phases, full sets of reflections are collected with known alterations to the scattering, either by modulating the wavelength past a certain <b>absorption</b> <b>edge</b> or by adding strongly scattering (i.e., electron-dense) metal atoms such as mercury. Combining the magnitudes and phases yields the full Fourier transform F(q), which may be inverted to obtain the electron density f(r).|$|E

2500|$|When the {{incident}} x-ray energy matches the binding energy of an electron of an atom within the sample, {{the number of}} x-rays absorbed by the sample increases dramatically, causing {{a drop in the}} transmitted x-ray intensity. This results in an <b>absorption</b> <b>edge.</b> Each element on the periodic table has a set of unique absorption edges corresponding to different binding energies of its electrons, giving XAS element selectivity. XAS spectra are most often collected at synchrotrons. Because X-rays are highly penetrating, XAS samples can be gases, solids or liquids. [...] And because of the brilliance of synchrotron X-ray sources the concentration of the absorbing element can be as low as a few ppm.|$|E

The synchrotron beam energy is tuned through the <b>absorption</b> <b>edge</b> of an element of interest, and modulations in the absorption are measured. Photoelectron transitions cause modulations near the <b>absorption</b> <b>edge,</b> and analysis of these modulations (called the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) or near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS)) reveals information about the chemical state and local symmetry of that element.

Fourier transformation of the EXAFS regime yields the bond lengths and number of the surrounding the absorbing atom; it is therefore useful for studying liquids and amorphous materials as well as sparse species such as impurities.

In the fluorescence yield detection mode, resonant X-ray scattering effects are observed at Fe/Cr and Co/Mn multilayer systems and single Fe films depending on their structure (especially their thickness) and on the measurement geometry.
