The show chronicles real-life medical techniques and technology, on the Discovery Channel. Nielsen said: [...] "There {{are any number of}} things that you think <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> ponder if you hadn't been an actor, what would you be, and I've always said I'd like to be an astronaut or a doctor. I have such admiration for doctors. I just don't know how you go around to thank them enough for coming up with the world's most remarkable new discoveries." ...|$|E

She cited her then-husband Marc Anthony as being that person for her. Monica Herrera of Billboard picked up on this, with the lyrics: [...] "I feel the beat again, stronger than before".

After being {{announced}} as the second single from Last Train to Paris on August 26, 2010, the mastered version of the song was leaked.

You love them more than you love yourself." [...] The song's official remix, released on October 22, 2010, features American rappers Gucci Mane and Red Cafe. Producer and rapper Jermaine Dupri also remixed the song with rap vocals from him, which was unveiled on September 29, 2010.

500|$|Boulter {{starred in}} two films in 2008, Daylight Robbery by filmmaker Paris Leonti, and Donkey Punch {{directed}} by Olly Blackburn.

He portrayed an emergency physician applying for a medical fellowship. He commented on the inherent difficulties in portraying a physician on television: [...] "Playing a doctor is a strange experience. Pretending you know what you're talking <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> don't is very bizarre but there are advisers on set who are fantastic at taking you through procedures and giving you the confidence to stand there and look like you know what you're doing." [...] Boulter starred in the 2011 film Mercenaries directed by Paris Leonti.|$|E
500|$|... "Clown"'s concept {{deals with}} an {{incident}} that happened in San Diego, California. A skinhead that told Davis to [...] "go back to Bakersfield" [...] attempted to hit Davis but he dodged and the band's road manager, Jeff, knocked the skinhead out. [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] was about Davis' drug abuse, and the fear that gripped him {{at the height of}} his drug problem. He pleaded for a divine intervention to deliver him from his nightmare, as if he cannot help himself. Davis explained: [...] "I'd wake up in the morning and do a line to get out of bed. Speed in the morning, I'd have it all lined up for breakfast so when I'd lay down and go to sleep, I'd wake up and just snort and it's like 'Yeah, okay, I'm up. ' It was bad. It's like, you do one line and stay up all night, but then you have shit to do the next day so you have to do another line to be able keep staying up to get that shit done. Eventually you start spinning-out from sleep deprivation. You get hallucinations and shit like that." [...] Davis said that [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] "is about meth. It's <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> do meth and you look down at your dick and it's literally a helmet in the bush [...] ". [...] "Basically it's what happens when you do too much drugs and your girl wanna get with you and you got some man problems down below. Just another reason not to do drugs, children," [...] Fieldy elaborated.|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Boortz {{enrolled}} in then-unaccredited John Marshall Law School (Atlanta) going to class {{in his spare}} time, while {{he and his wife}} Donna worked full-time loading mail trucks. Boortz credits his wife with providing [...] "the money to keep me in law school". After graduating from law school in 1977, Boortz practiced law in a solo law firm from 1977 through 1993. During that period, he divided his time between his law practice and work in radio. One of Boortz's clients was boxer Evander Holyfield. Holyfield later sued Boortz and other members of his management team {{in the aftermath of a}} failed Subaru dealership investment. Boortz told Atlanta Magazine [...] "It had nothing to do with representing him as a boxer. It was settled and disappeared." [...] Some time later, in a heated on-air exchange between Atlanta mayor Bill Campbell and Boortz, Campbell remarked on the Holyfield relationship: Campbell (sarcastically): By the way, Neal, Evander Holyfield sends his regards ... We talked a little about how good he's doing now and the fact he's getting ready to open up his 57,000 square-foot, $20 million home. How he's fighting for $35 million a fight. I was sorta thinking <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were representing him. He was living in an apartment over on Lenox Road. He was fighting for about $20,000 a fight. It's sort of interesting how your great legal skills have transferred into financial well-being for Evander .... Boortz responded by calling mayor Campbell an [...] "unethical son of a bitch". Boortz later remarked [...] "It's the only time I've ever been on the air that I lost control." [...] In 1993, Boortz closed his law practice and devoted his full-time to his radio career.|$|E

2500|$|... "Call on Me" [...] {{was written}} by Jermaine Dupri, Johntá Austin, James Phillips, Nelly, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, while {{production}} was handled by Janet Jackson, Dupri, Phillips, Jam and Lewis. It is a mid-tempo ballad which samples The SOS Band's 1983 song [...] "Tell Me If You Still Care," [...] also written and produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. According to Dupri, lyrically, [...] "It's really just a record <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> need a friend, somebody {{you need to talk}} to, just call on a person. It's a friend record. It ain't really a boyfriend/girlfriend record. The way Nelly and Janet are talking is more girlfriend/boyfriend, but it really goes out to friends." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, Twomey {{acquired}} West Pin Vineyard in the Russian River Valley {{to begin}} making Russian River Valley Pinot noir. In 2010, the Duncan family purchased the 17-acre Monument Tree Vineyard, {{one of the}} most sought-after vineyards for Pinot noir production in the Anderson Valley. The vineyard, located {{at the top of the}} Anderson Valley, is named after an imposing redwood tree which towers above the hillside vineyard which was struck by lightning. Winemaker Ben Cane describes the vineyard as [...] "the kind of site you dream <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> love Pinot noir", adding that its proximity to the coast allowed for a longer ripening period to develop more complexity in the fruit and that its planting on a selection of Dijon clones on decomposed sandstone loam soils made it the [...] "ultimate low vigor slow-ripening vineyard." [...] Dominic Orsini is winery chef for both Twomey and Silver Oak.|$|E
