50|$|The {{telephone}} {{numbering plan}} of the Netherlands is divided into geographical, non-geographical, and special public resource telephone numbers. The dial plan prescribes that within the country dialling both geographical and non-geographical numbers requires a national network access code, which is the digit 0. The following list includes this national trunk <b>access</b> <b>digit</b> when it must be dialled before the number.|$|E

This aspect is unintentionally helpful for employees who reside in one area code and work in an area code with one, two, or three adjacent area codes. 1+ dialing to any area code by an employee can be done quickly, with all exceptions processed by the private branch exchange and passed onto the public switched telephone network.|$|R

40|$|Adults’ simple {{arithmetic}} {{performance is}} more efficient when operands are presented in Arabic digit (3 + 5) than in number word (three + five) formats. An explanation provided is that visual familiarity with digits is higher respect to number words. However, most studies have been limited to single-digit addition and multiplication problems. In this article, we examine to what extent format effects {{can be found in}} the context of arithmetic word problems, in which visual familiarity is reduced (Manuel had 3 marbles, and then Pedro gave to him 5). Participants with high and low arithmetic fluency solved addition and subtraction word problems in which operands were presented in both formats. The overall results showed an advantage for digits operands relative to words operands. In addition, the format effects were more evident for subtraction and low-skilled participants. These results were interpreted in terms of more rapid <b>access</b> of <b>digits</b> to numerical magnitude. status: publishe...|$|R
2500|$|On 10 November, a Russian Navy {{statement}} {{blamed the}} disaster on an [...] "unsanctioned operation" [...] {{of the fire}} suppression system aboard Nerpa. Three days later, naval investigators announced that a crewman, named unofficially as Dmitry Grobov, had turned on the system [...] "without permission or any particular grounds". According to reports in the Russian media, Grobov believed that a local control unit was not connected. Out of boredom he started playing with it. The submarine local control units are protected by five <b>digit</b> <b>access</b> numbers but during sea trials the access codes were penciled on the units. [...] The seaman increased readings up from the original value of 30°C to 78°C, causing the control system {{to believe that there}} was a fire on board. The control unit requested permission to start the fire suppression system. Grobov granted permission, possibly without realizing what he was doing. He was charged and would face up to seven years in prison if convicted.|$|R
