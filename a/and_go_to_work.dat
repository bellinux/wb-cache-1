Again, Middleton could not do that, and began looking for a suitable follow-on assignment. Not having been overseas in over sixteen years, he put in a request for duty in the Philippines.

When Burt's son Kurt (Chris Colfer) accuses her of lying, Sue defends her tactics, and tells Kurt that his own campaign for senior class president is boring and lacks edge. When the presidential candidates make their assembly speeches, Kurt pledges to ban dodgeball, a sport he says is too often used to bully. Rachel (Lea Michele) withdraws her candidacy and urges everyone to vote for Kurt. Rachel later confesses to Kurt that she quit {{so that he could}} have something important to put on his college application, and because she missed being his friend. The two make up, <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on Kurt's campaign.|$|E

After working in the Jordanian Army for nine years, he left and worked as a machinist for a company in Jordan and also for a radio station, singing in Arabic. In the mid-1970s he decided that he was now financially able to marry. He met Teresa through a mutual friend. She had emigrated to the United States and they exchanged letters and photographs for about three months. She returned to Jordan only two or three weeks before the wedding.|$|E

25|$|Montag awakens ill {{the next}} morning, with Mildred nagging {{him to get}} up <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> As Mildred tries {{to care for her}} husband (but finds herself more {{involved}} in the parlor wall entertainment in the next room), Montag suggests that maybe he should take a break from being a fireman after what happened last night. Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall family and angrily blames the old woman who killed herself over her books for Montag's change of heart over his job. Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing Montag's concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: {{over the course of several}} decades, people embraced new media (in this case, film and television), sports, and a quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate a short attention span while minority groups protested over the controversial, outdated content perceived to be found in literature (yet comic books, trade papers, and sex magazines were allowed to stay, as those fed into the population's want for mindless entertainment). The government took advantage of this by turning the firemen into officers of people's peace of mind. Beatty adds casually that all firemen eventually steal a book out of curiosity; if the book is burned within 24 hours, the fireman and his family will not get in trouble.|$|E
500|$|The writer Charles Dickens {{was born}} to a respectable family which got into {{financial}} difficulties {{as a result of}} the spendthrift nature of John, Dickens's father. In 1824 John was committed to Marshalsea, a debtors' prison in Southwark, London. Dickens, aged 12, was forced to pawn his collection of books, leave school <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at a shoe-blacking factory, a dirty and rat-infested place.

500|$|The war's end {{swung the}} {{pendulum}} back. Farmers continued to dislike DST, and many countries repealed {{it after the}} war. Britain was an exception: it retained DST nationwide {{but over the years}} adjusted transition dates for several reasons, including special rules during the 1920s and 1930s to avoid clock shifts on Easter mornings. Now under a European Community directive summer time begins annually on the last Sunday in March, which may be Easter Sunday (as in 2016). The U.S. was more typical: Congress repealed DST after 1919. President Woodrow Wilson, like Willett an avid golfer, vetoed the repeal twice but his second veto was overridden. Only a few U.S. cities retained DST locally thereafter, including New York so that its financial exchanges could maintain an hour of arbitrage trading with London, and Chicago and Cleveland to keep pace with New York. Wilson's successor Warren G. Harding opposed DST as a [...] "deception". Reasoning that people should instead get up <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> earlier in the summer, he ordered District of Columbia federal employees to start work at 08:00 rather than 09:00 during summer 1922. Some businesses followed suit though many others did not; the experiment was not repeated.|$|E

It was costing Selznick $50,000 each day the film was on hold waiting for a final screenplay rewrite and time was of the essence. Hecht {{was in the middle}} of working on the film At the Circus for the Marx Brothers. Recalling the episode in a letter to screenwriter friend Gene Fowler, he said he hadn't read the novel but Selznick {{and director}} Fleming could not wait for him to read it. They would act out scenes based on Sidney Howard's original script which needed to be rewritten in a hurry. Hecht wrote, [...] "After each scene had been performed and discussed, I sat down at the typewriter and wrote it out. Selznick and Fleming, eager to continue with their acting, kept hurrying me. We worked in this fashion for seven days, putting in eighteen to twenty hours a day. Selznick refused to let us eat lunch, arguing that food would slow us up. He provided bananas and salted peanuts ... thus on the seventh day I had completed, unscathed, the first nine reels of the Civil War epic." ...|$|E

It states: [...] "Hal Stephens, a wealthy young man, devotes all his time to enjoying himself, thereby earns the disapproval of his staid old father. The elder Stephen sees the young man start off on an auto trip with some gay friends, and decides to call a halt. He notifies his son by telegram {{that it is time}} he went to work, and presents him with the factory. This arouses the merriment of his friends, but Hal declares that he will buckle down <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> He tells his father, however, that he desires to start incognito, and the father consents. Hal enters the factory and goes to work as an ordinary laborer, his identity being unknown to all. He meets Lou, a young working girl, and falls in love with her. The manager of the place, one Conners, tries to make love to Lou, and Hal protects her. There is an order put up reducing salaries 10%, and Lou induces the others to strike rather than to submit. The strikers, starved out, finally return to work, with the exception of Lou, who is defiant to the end. Hal finds her weeping on the steps of her home and tells her of his love. She agrees to marry him. After she has accepted him, he leads her to the factory, announces his identity, assumes possession, and restores wages to the old scale, after having discharged the rogue Conners." ...|$|E

Over the years, he went from being the crew's best friend and just being grateful for the work and all of that to realizing that he was going to be a movie star and wanting to move on. Part of that was because of his strained relationship with Cybill. That sometimes made the set a very unpleasant place to be.

2500|$|Fritz Sauckel, the General Plenipotentiary for Labour Deployment, {{making him}} {{the man in charge}} of {{bringing}} slaves to the factories in Germany demanded the flight of young men to the countryside be stopped and called the maquis [...] "terrorists", [...] "bandits" [...] and [...] "criminals" [...] for their unwillingness to become slaves. The extent of popular resistance to the STO law can be seen in that one of every two French people who should have served in the STO failed to do so. Sauckel had been ordered by Hitler in February 1943 to produce half million workers from France for German industry no later than March 1943, and it was he who had pressured Laval to create the STO with the law of 16 February 1943. Sauckel had joined the NSDAP in 1923, making him an Alter K√§mpfer (Old Fighter), and like many other Alte K√§mpfer (who tended to the most extreme Nazis), Sauckel was a hard man. Despite warnings from Laval, Sauckel took the view that he was ordered by Albert Speer to produce a quota of slaves for German industry, that the men joining the maquis were sabotaging German industry by fleeing to the countryside rather than going to work as slaves in Germany and the solution was simply to kill them all, so he could meet his quota. Sauckel believed that once the maquis were wiped out, Frenchmen would obediently report to the STO <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in Germany. When Laval was presented with Sauckel's latest demand for French labor for German industry, he remarked: [...] "Have you been sent by de Gaulle?". Laval argued the r√©fractaries were not political opponents and should not be treated as such, arguing that an amnesty and a promise that the r√©fractaries would not be sent as slaves to Germany would nip the budding maquis movement. As Laval predicated, the hardline policies that Sauckel advocated turned the basically apolitical maquis political, driving them straight into the resistance as the maquisards turned to the established resistance groups to ask for arms and training. Sauckel decided that if Frenchmen would not report to the STO, he would have the Todt organisation use the shanghaillage (shanghaiing) the French by storming into cinemas to arrest the patrons or raiding villages in search of bodies to turn into slaves to meet the quotas imposed by Speer. Otto Abetz, the Francophile German ambassador to Vichy had also warned that Sauckel was driving the maquis into the resistance with his hardline policies and once joked to Sauckel that the maquis should put up a statue of him with the inscription [...] "To our number one recruitment agent". The French called Sauckel [...] "the slave-trader". Furthermore, as Laval warned, the scale of the problem was beyond Vichy's means to solve. The prefets of the departments of the Loz√®re, the H√©rault, the Aude, the Pyr√©√©n√©es-Orientales, and Aveyron had been given a list of 853 r√©fractaries to arrest, and managed during the next four months to arrest only 1 r√©fractarie. After the Battle of Stalingrad, which ended with the destruction of the entire German 6th Army in February 1943, many had started to doubt the inevitability of an Axis victory, and most French gendarmes were not willing to hunt the down the maquis, knowing full well that they might be tried for their actions if the Allies won. Only the men of the Groupe mobile de r√©serve para-military police force were considered reliable, but the force was too small for the task of hunting down thousands of men. As the Germans as much as possible preferred to subcontract the work of ruling France to the French while retaining ultimate control it was the Milice that was given the task of destroying the maquis. The Milice was in Ousby's words [...] "Vichy's only instrument for fighting the Maquis. Entering the popular vocabulary at more or less the same time, the words maquis and milice together defined the new realities: the one a little-known word for the back country of Corsica, which became a synonym for militant resistance; the other a familiar word meaning simply [...] "militia", which became a synonym for militant repression. The Maquis and the Milice were enemies thrown up by the final chaos of the Occupation, in a sense twins symbiotically linked in a final hunt".|$|E
