5|$|As the {{mountains}} are eroded, {{more and more}} sand is created. At high wind speeds, sand grains are picked up off the surface <b>and</b> <b>blown</b> along, {{a process known as}} saltation. The whirling airborne grains act as a sand blasting mechanism which grinds away solid objects in its path as the kinetic energy of the wind is transferred to the ground. The sand eventually ends up deposited in level areas known as sand-fields or sand-seas, or piled up in dunes.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the origins of the storm, though modern reanalysis efforts suggest that it was first noted at Barbados on September22. The intensifying {{hurricane}} passed just south of Jamaica on September26 and 27, affecting the island with strong winds and heavy rains. On September28, HMSRacer, a Royal Navy sloop-of-war, encountered the storm in the northwestern Caribbean. She was dismasted <b>and</b> <b>blown</b> on her beam ends twice before re-righting, and a young boy plus two crewmen aboard the ship died during the hurricane. Since the ship was apparently the first to observe the cyclone at sea, writers and historians have commonly referred to the system as Racer'sstorm or Racer'shurricane.|$|E

5|$|Rivera's 2008 {{season was}} one of his best {{individual}} years. Along with a 1.40ERA and 39saves in 40opportunities, he set career bests in multiple statistical categories, including WHIP (0.67), on-base plus slugging (OPS)-against (.422), batting average against (.165), save percentage (97.5%), walks (6), earned runs (11), <b>and</b> <b>blown</b> saves (1). He averaged 9.81strikeouts per 9 innings pitched, his best mark as a closer. He pitched with such control that his 12.83strikeout-to-walk ratio made him the second MLB pitcher ever to record a figure that high in a season (minimum 50innings pitched). He placed fifth in the AL Cy Young Award voting.|$|E
5|$|Mature {{specimens}} of Battarrea phalloides roughly resemble the typical agaric mushroom stature of stem and cap. However, {{rather than a}} cap with gills, this species has a spore sac atop the stem. When young, the fruit body is roughly spherical and completely encased in an outer wall (exoperidium) that later splits in a circumscissile fashion (along a circular or equatorial line), the lower wall forming a volva and the upper part forming scales that cover the inner wall. The upper part rolls upward and backward and eventually falls away in one piece, exposing a spore sac lined with a narrow ring of capillitium and spores. The spores are sticky. As these are carried away by the wind, the drying action of the latter cause {{the edges of the}} peridium to shrivel and roll up more, exposing more spores. This is continued until the upper half of the peridium has shriveled <b>and</b> <b>blown</b> away and there remains only a few spores, which may be washed away by rain.|$|E
5|$|Other proffered {{explanations}} are the possible {{appearance of a}} displaced iceberg; the fear of running aground while becalmed, and a sudden seaquake. Hydrographical evidence suggests that an iceberg drifting so far south was improbable, and had it done so other ships would have seen it. Begg gives more consideration to a theory that Mary Celeste, while becalmed, began drifting towards the Dollabarat reef off Santa Maria Island. The theory supposes that Briggs, fearing his ship would run aground, launched the yawl {{in the hope of}} reaching land. The wind could then have picked up <b>and</b> <b>blown</b> Mary Celeste away from the reef, while the rising seas swamped and sank the yawl. The weakness of this theory is that if the ship had been becalmed, all sails would have been set to catch any available breeze, yet the ship was found with many of its sails furled.|$|E

5|$|Nelson {{passed through}} the Straits of Gibraltar and took up {{position}} off Toulon by 17 May, but his squadron was dispersed <b>and</b> <b>blown</b> southwards by a strong gale that struck the area on 20 May. While the British were battling the storm, Napoleon had sailed with his invasion fleet {{under the command of}} Vice Admiral François-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers. Nelson, having been reinforced with a number of ships from St Vincent, went in pursuit. He began searching the Italian coast for Napoleon's fleet, but was hampered by a lack of frigates that could operate as fast scouts. Napoleon had already arrived at Malta and, after a show of force, secured the island's surrender. Nelson followed him there, but the French had already left. After a conference with his captains, he decided Egypt was Napoleon's most likely destination and headed for Alexandria. On his arrival on 28 June, though, he found no sign of the French; dismayed, he withdrew and began searching to the east of the port. While he was absent, Napoleon's fleet arrived on 1 July and landed their forces unopposed.|$|E

Above the mesh, the air jet is distributed over the complete sieve surface and is sucked in with low speed through the sieve mesh. Thus the finer particles are transported through the mesh openings into the vacuum cleaner.|$|E

Guns were dragged by hundreds of troops on mountains up to 3,890 m (12,760 feet) high. Roads, cable cars, mountain railroads and walkways were built up, through and along the steepest of cliffs. Many of these walkways and roads are still visible today, and many are maintained as Via Ferrata for climbing enthusiasts. In addition, along the former frontline it is still possible to see what is left of hundreds of kilometers of barbed wire.|$|E
25|$|The French Crusaders {{were based}} on the F-8E, but were {{modified}} in order to allow operations from the small French carriers, with the maximum angle of incidence of the aircraft's wing increased from five to seven degrees <b>and</b> <b>blown</b> flaps fitted.

Deliveries of the new aircraft, dubbed the F-8E(FN), started in October 1964 and continued until February 1965, with the Aéronavales first squadron, Flotille 12F reactivated on 1 October 1964. To replace the old Corsairs, Flotille 14.F received its Crusaders on 1 March 1965.|$|E

25|$|This large rain-wrapped tornado {{touched down}} at 7:50p.m. CDT (0050 UTC) on May 31, {{southwest}} of Weldon Spring in St. Charles County, Missouri. It first produced EF1 damage as it downed trees, blew over empty trailers, and caused minor damage to construction equipment. It moved generally east-northeast into Weldon Spring Heights (on {{the south side}} of Weldon Spring) and caused roof, window, and solar panel damage to a few structures as well as downing more trees before crossing Interstate 64. The tornado continued moving east-northeast through densely populated residential areas of southern St. Charles County. Roofing was torn off of a middle school <b>and</b> <b>blown</b> , many houses suffered varying degrees of roof (from minor damage to removal of entire roof), wall (from minor damage to total collapse), and overall structural damage, and hundreds of trees were downed. Damage in this area ranged from EF1 to EF2. A shed was destroyed, a garage door was compromised and the roof was removed <b>and</b> <b>blown</b> away, another garage had a wall collapsed, and two more garages were completely destroyed. The tornado reached its maximum intensity to the east-northeast of Weldon Spring, west-southwest of St. Charles and Harvester, and south of St. Peters. Three adjacent frame homes at this location sustained total loss of their roofs and exterior walls, and this small pocket of damage was rated EF3. The tornado continued causing damage in residential areas further to the east and northeast, snapping many trees and causing roof and wall damage to many homes. A few homes had their roofs entirely ripped off, and damage along this portion of the path was rated EF1 to EF2. Crossing the Missouri River, the tornado moved into St. Louis County and Earth City, Bridgeton, and the northern side of Maryland Heights as it moved along Interstate 70 near its intersection with Interstate 270.|$|E

Several railroad cars were lifted <b>and</b> <b>blown</b> over as the tornado passed over a moving Penn Central freight train in the center of town. It toppled headstones in Cherry Grove Cemetery, then moved through the length of the downtown business district, passing west of the courthouse (which sustained some exterior damage). Numerous businesses in downtown Xenia were heavily damaged or destroyed, and several people were killed at the A Root Beer stand as the building was flattened. Past downtown, the tornado continued into the Pinecrest Garden district, which was extensively affected.|$|E
