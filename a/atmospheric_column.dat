60|$|My own {{barometric}} levellings {{would make}} {{the bed of the}} Mahanuddy and Ganges at the western extremity of the delta, considerably higher than I should have expected, considering how gentle the current is, and that the season was that of low water. If my observations are correct, they probably indicate a diminished pressure, which is not easily accounted for, the lower portion of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>column</b> at Rampore being considerably drier and therefore heavier than at Calcutta. At the eastern extremity again, towards Silhet, the atmosphere is much damper than at Calcutta, and the barometer should therefore have stood lower, indicating a higher level of the waters than is the case.|$|E
60|$|It is hence evident, {{from nearly}} 1,000 {{comparative}} observations, that {{the atmosphere is}} relatively more humid at Dorjiling than at Calcutta, throughout the year. As the southerly current, to which alone is due all the moisture of Sikkim, traverses 200 miles of land, and discharges from sixty to eighty inches of rain before arriving at Dorjiling, {{it follows that the}} whole <b>atmospheric</b> <b>column</b> is relatively drier over the Himalaya than over Calcutta; that the absolute amount of vapour, in short, is less than it would otherwise be at the elevation of Dorjiling, though the relative humidity is so great. A glance at the table {{at the end of this}} section appears to confirm this; for it is there shown that, at the base of the Himalaya, at an elevation of only 250 feet higher than Calcutta, the absolute amount of vapour is less, and of relative humidity greater, than at Calcutta.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} ecacy {{of the above}} {{feedback}} process {{in the context of}} a two-column model of tropical circulations similar to that proposed by Pierrehumbert (1995) and Nilsson and Emanuel (1999). In particular, we pose the following question: Imagine two <b>atmospheric</b> <b>columns,</b> each of which represents the mean conditions in a homogenous region with a horizontal scale much larger than a single convective system. If the columns have identical SSTs, solar inputs, etc., and are initially in radiativeconvective equilibrium, will a perturbation to one of the columns intensify or decay with time? If the two-column system is unstable in that the perturbation grows with time, then it is likely that the tropical atmosphere will exhibit a similar instability...|$|R

60|$|A vast body of {{warm air}} had passed unheeded athwart the bark, during the minute {{that preceded the}} {{intended}} sacrifice of Balthazar. It was the forerunner of the hurricane, which had chased it from the bed {{where it had been}} sleeping, since the warm and happy noon-tide. Ten thousand chariots at their speed could not have equalled the rumbling that succeeded, when the winds came booming over the lake. As if too eager to permit anything within their fangs to escape, they brought with them a wild, dull light, which filled while it clouded the atmosphere, and which, it was scarcely fanciful to imagine, had been hurried down, in their vortex, from those chill glaciers, where they had so long been condensing their forces for the present descent. The waves were not increased, but depressed by the pressure of this <b>atmospheric</b> <b>column,</b> though it took up hogshead, of water from their crests, scattering it in fine penetrating spray, till the entire space between the heavens and the earth seemed saturated with its particles.|$|E
60|$|Considering how {{desultory}} {{the observations}} in Sikkim are, {{and how much}} affected by local circumstances, the above results must be considered highly satisfactory: they prove that the relative humidity of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>column</b> remains pretty constant throughout all elevations, except when these are in a Tibetan climate; and when above 18,000 feet, elevations which I attained in fine weather only. Up to 12,000 feet this constant humidity is very marked; the observations made at greater elevations were almost invariably to the north, or leeward of the great snowy peaks, and consequently in a drier climate; and there it will be seen that these proportions are occasionally inverted; and in Tibet itself a degree of relative dryness is encountered, such as is never equalled on the plains of Eastern Bengal or the Gangetic delta. Whether an isolated peak rising near Calcutta, to the elevation of 19,000 feet, would present similar results to the above, is not proven by these observations, but as the relative humidity is the same at all elevations on the outermost ranges of Sikkim, which attain 10,000 feet, and as these rise from the plains like steep islands out of the ocean, it may be presumed {{that the effects of}} elevation would be the same in both cases.|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} hand an {{inquirer}} who insists on knowing what suction is, may obtain from the physicist answers which give him clear ideas, not only about it but about many other things. He learns that on ourselves and all things around, there is an atmospheric pressure amounting to about 15 pounds on the square inch: 15 pounds being the average weight of a column of air having a square inch for its base and extending upwards from the sea-level to the limit of the Earth's atmosphere. He is made to observe that when he puts {{one end of a}} tube into water and the other end into his mouth, and then draws back his tongue, so leaving a vacant space, two things happen. One is that the pressure of air outside his cheeks, no longer balanced by an equal pressure of air inside, thrusts his cheeks inwards; and the other is that the pressure of air {{on the surface of the}} water, no longer balanced by an equal pressure of air within the tube and his mouth (into which part of the air from the tube has gone) the water is forced up the tube in consequence of the unequal pressure. Once understanding thus the nature of the so-called suction, he sees how it happens that when the plunger of the pump is raised and relieves from atmospheric pressure the water below it, the atmospheric pressure on the water in the well, not being balanced by that on the water in the tube, forces the water higher up the tube, so that it follows the plunger. And now he sees why the water cannot be raised beyond the theoretic limit of 32 feet: a limit made much lower in practice by imperfections in the apparatus. For if, simplifying the conception, he supposes the tube of the pump to be a square inch in section, then the atmospheric pressure of 15 pounds per square inch on the water in the well, can raise the water in the tube to such height only that the entire column of it weighs 15 pounds. Having been thus enlightened about the pump's action, the action of a barometer becomes intelligible. He perceives how, under the conditions established, the weight of the column of mercury balances that of an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>column</b> of equal diameter; and how, as the weight of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>column</b> varies, there is a corresponding variation in the weight of the mercurial column,--shown by change of height. Moreover, having previously supposed that he understood the ascent of a balloon when he ascribed it to relative lightness, he now sees that he did not truly understand it. For he did not recognize it as a result of that upward pressure caused by the difference between the weight of the mass formed by the gas in the balloon plus the cylindrical column of air extending above it to the limit of the atmosphere, and the weight of a similar cylindrical column of air extending down to the under surface of the balloon: this difference of weight causing an equivalent upward pressure on the under surface.|$|E
