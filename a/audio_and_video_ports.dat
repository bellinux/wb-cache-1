5000|$|The new AV {{machines}} {{were some of}} the first to ship standard with an internal CD-ROM drive (earlier Quadra and Centris models were available with the built-in CD-ROM drive as optional extras). The Quadra 840av was the first Apple computer to come with an internal CD-ROM standard. The operating system installation package came on CD-ROM rather than a series of floppy disks whenever the CD-ROM drive was included. A hidden QuickTime video included on the original Quadra 840AV/Centris 660AV [...] "Install Me First" [...] CD-ROM, shows the jubilant Cyclone / Tempest design team in the midst of celebrating their accomplishment. In this video, a Cyclone (840AV) prototype logic board is shown. The logic board is fitted with a 25 MHz 68040, a number of rework wires, and most conspicuously, a daughter card nicknamed [...] "Karma", on which the audio and video input/output ports are located. Notably, the <b>audio</b> <b>and</b> <b>video</b> <b>ports</b> on the card are front-facing, positioned as though they would protrude from an opening in the lower front of the case, where they are more easily accessible to the user. According to a member of the team, the [...] "AV on a card" [...] feature was omitted, because there was not enough room for it in the case. Coinciding with the introduction of both AV Macs, Apple introduced the Apple AudioVision 14 Display, featuring easily accessible audio input, audio output and video input ports of its own, which could be fed by an ADC adapter cable connected with the rear AV ports of the AV Macs.|$|E

5000|$|The A4000T was {{the only}} Amiga ever to have both SCSI and IDE {{interfaces}} built-in on the motherboard. Having driver software for both interfaces in the 512 KB ROM meant that some other parts of AmigaOS had to be moved from the ROM, and thus the A4000T is the only machine to require the file [...] "" [...] to be stored on disk. It was also the only Amiga to use a PC form factor for the motherboard (AT), {{and one of the}} few to use a lithium battery instead of a nickel-cadmium rechargeable battery, vastly reducing the risk of leaking corrosive fluids onto the motherboard and causing damage with age. Modularity was another unique aspect to the machine, with the CPU, <b>audio,</b> <b>video,</b> <b>and</b> input-output <b>ports</b> all on separate daughterboards. This made the machine near-modular.|$|R

30|$|However, the {{proposed}} models have some limitations: when the <b>audio</b> <b>and</b> <b>video</b> qualities <b>and</b> impairment factors are predicted from <b>audio</b> <b>and</b> <b>video</b> quality models, the impairment-factor-based variants are less robust to <b>audio</b> <b>and</b> <b>video</b> quality prediction errors than the quality-based variants. More studies {{are necessary for}} identifying the thresholds of <b>audio</b> <b>and</b> <b>video</b> quality prediction errors at which the impairment-factor-based variants start to perform worse than the quality-based variants.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper proposes an <b>audio</b> <b>and</b> <b>video</b> {{synchronization}} method based on playback time. In ordinary playing process, the playback rate of audio is constant, {{so we can}} locate the playback time of <b>audio</b> <b>and</b> <b>video</b> by locating the key frame to get synchronization. Experimental results show that this method can get synchronization between <b>audio</b> <b>and</b> <b>video</b> <b>and</b> be achieved simply, furthermore, it can reduce the system overhead for synchronization...|$|R

Low cost multimedia conferencing technology could benefit many users in different areas, such as remote collaboration, distance education and healthcare.

Established methods of rating <b>audio</b> <b>and</b> <b>video</b> quality in the broadcast and telephony world cannot be applied to digital, lower quality images and sound.

30|$|One more {{aspect to}} be {{considered}} is how the degradation type influences the quality impact of <b>audio</b> <b>and</b> <b>video</b> on the overall audiovisual quality. In our case, the employed degradation types were <b>audio</b> <b>and</b> <b>video</b> compression, <b>audio</b> frame loss, <b>and</b> <b>video</b> packet loss. We want to know, for instance, if for a given level of <b>audio</b> <b>and</b> <b>video</b> qualities we obtain different audiovisual quality values for audio compression than for audio packet loss, even though both {{have resulted in the}} same audio-only quality in the audio test. This aspect will be discussed further in the following modeling section.|$|R
