5|$|The Battle of the Olive Grove of Kountouras {{took place}} in the summer of 1205, in Messenia in the Peloponnese peninsula, between the Frankish Crusaders and the local Greeks, {{resulting}} in a victory of the Frankish knights <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of the local resistance.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{contend that}} for the UN and North Korea, locked in a bitter battle where neither could gain the upper hand, {{logistics}} {{was among the most}} important determining factors in how the war would progress. As the disparity in logistics capability widened between the UN and North Korean forces, the well-supported UN troops were able to hold their positions along the Pusan Perimeter, while the morale and the fighting quality of NKPA deteriorated as resupplies became increasingly unreliable. This trend ultimately culminated in the UN recapturing Seoul, the key logistics center of the battle, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of the North Korean logistics system with the entire NKPA.|$|E
5|$|Intermittent torrents {{battered}} Saint Kitts and Nevis for {{at least}} four days; a total of up to 10.99inches (279mm) of precipitation was recorded during that time. Several homeowners reported significant flooding, and a number of persons had to be rescued from their homes. Gusty winds generated rough sea conditions along coastal regions, resulting in some beach erosion <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of a sidewalk section. Rains and associated floods topped a number of culverts and bridges, washed out the sides of some roadways, and damage to some utility lines, followed by significant disruptions to electricity services. The exact amount of damage to the territory remains unknown, however.|$|E

The Nova Scotia cotton mill located 1.5km (0.93 mile) from the blast was destroyed by fire <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of its concrete floors. The Royal Naval College of Canada building was badly damaged, and several cadets and instructors maimed.|$|E
5|$|Llywelyn's power {{declined}} {{over the}} next two decades. In 1276 Henry's son, Edward I, invaded Wales following a dispute with the prince, breaking his power in South Wales, and in 1282 Edward's second campaign resulted in Llwelyn's death <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of independent Welsh rule. Further defences were added to the walls until work stopped around 1290. Local disputes remained. De Clare argued with Humphrey de Bohun, the earl of Hereford, in 1290 and the following year the case was brought before the king, resulting in the temporary royal seizure of Caerphilly.|$|E
5|$|On 9 November 2008, Chelsea Football Club were {{reported}} to be considered moving to a new purpose built stadium at the power station. The proposed stadium was to hold between 65,000 and 75,000 fans and feature a retractable roof. The proposals were designed by HOK Sport, the same company who designed Wembley Stadium. However, the Chelsea FC scheme was seriously in doubt due to concerns {{for the preservation of}} the site <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of the REO scheme in late November 2011.|$|E

5|$|Paranhos {{was born}} on 16 March 1819 in Salvador, Bahia, {{at a time when}} Brazil was a kingdom united with Portugal. His parents were Agostinho da Silva Paranhos and Josefa Emerenciana de Barreiros. Agostinho Paranhos, along with his two brothers, {{migrated}} to Brazil during {{the first decade of the}} 19th century. He became a wealthy merchant and married Josefa, the Brazilian-born daughter of one of Bahia's long-established families. Her family had roots in Porto, where Agostinho's own family had originated. Agostinho remained loyal to Portugal at the time of Brazil's Independence in 1822, which resulted in his ostracism <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of his business.|$|E
5|$|The Mafia only became {{credible}} {{again after}} the end of the invasion. The Allied Military Government of Occupied Territories (AMGOT), looking for anti-fascist notables to replace fascist authorities, made Don Calogero Vizzini mayor of Villalba, as well as an Honorary Colonel of the US Army. In the chaos that followed the invasion of Sicily <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of Fascism, the American army often relied on senior churchmen for advice on whom to trust. Don Calò was one of those recommended. He had a long record of involvement with Catholic social funds and there were several clergymen in his family.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{hearing of}} his son's death <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of his rearguard, Pyrrhus summoned his Molossian cavalry and charged the Spartans. In the battle that followed, Pyrrhus killed the Spartan leader Evaclus {{with his own}} hand and succeeded in annihilating the {{pursuing}} Spartan troops. After this skirmish, the Epiriotes continued their march to Argos. However, upon reaching his destination, he found that Antigonus had arrived at Argos first and camped to the city's north. The Macedonian presence compelled Pyrrhus to pitch camp at Nauplion {{to the south of}} Argos.|$|E
5|$|Between World War I, the Russian Revolution, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of the Ottoman Empire, many {{historic}} European stud farms were lost; in Poland, the Antoniny and Slawuta Studs were {{wiped out}} except for five mares. Notable among the survivors was the Janów Podlaski Stud. The Russian Revolution, combined {{with the effects of}} World War I, destroyed most of the breeding programs in Russia, but by 1921, the Soviet government reestablished an Arabian program, the Tersk Stud, {{on the site of the}} former Stroganov estate, which included Polish bloodstock as well as some importations from the Crabbet Stud in England. The programs that survived the war re-established their breeding operations and some added to their studs with new imports of desert-bred Arabian horses from the Middle East. Not all European studs recovered. The Weil stud of Germany, founded by King Wilhelm I, went into considerable decline; by the time the Weil herd was transferred to the Marbach State Stud in 1932, only 17 purebred Arabians remained.|$|E
5|$|In 1806 the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Charles William Ferdinand, was fatally wounded {{during the}} Prussian defeat at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt. Following Prussia's defeat <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of the Fourth Coalition against Napoleon, his duchy {{remained}} under French control. Rather than permit the Duke's heir, Frederick William, to succeed to his father's title, Napoleon seized the duchy and, in 1807, incorporated {{it into his}} newly created model Kingdom of Westphalia ruled by his brother Jérôme. Two years later in 1809 the Fifth Coalition against Napoleon was formed between the Austrian Empire and the United Kingdom. The dispossessed Frederick William, {{who had been a}} strenuous critic of French domination in Germany, seized this opportunity to seek Austrian help to raise an armed force. To finance this venture he mortgaged his principality in Oels. In its initial incarnation (dated to 25 July 1809), the 2300-strong 'free' corps consisted of two battalions of infantry, one Jäger battalion, a company of sharpshooters, and a mixed cavalry contingent including hussars and uhlans.|$|E

5|$|On 20 August, {{with his}} forces encircled, Model {{organised}} {{attacks on the}} Polish position from {{both within and outside}} the pocket. The Germans managed to isolate the ridge and force open a narrow escape corridor. Lacking the fighting power to close the corridor, the Poles nevertheless directed constant and accurate artillery fire on German units retreating from the pocket, causing heavy casualties. Exasperated, the Germans launched fierce attacks throughout 20 August which inflicted losses on Hill 262's entrenched defenders. Exhausted and dangerously low on ammunition, the Poles managed to retain their foothold on the ridge. The following day, less intense attacks continued until midday, when the last German effort to overrun the position was defeated at close quarters. The Poles were relieved by the Canadian Grenadier Guards shortly after noon; their dogged stand had ensured the closure of the Falaise pocket <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of the German position in Normandy.|$|E
5|$|On 7 February 1999, Abdullah II {{ascended the}} throne upon {{the death of}} his father Hussein. Abdullah {{embarked}} on aggressive economic liberalisation when he assumed the throne, and his reforms led to an economic boom which continued until 2008. Abdullah II has been credited with increasing foreign investment, improving public-private partnerships and providing the foundation for Aqaba's free-trade zone and Jordan's flourishing information and communication technology (ICT) sector. He also set up five other special economic zones. During the following years Jordan's economy experienced hardship as it dealt with the effects of the Great Recession and spillover from the Arab Spring, including a cut in its petroleum supply <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of trade with neighbouring countries.|$|E

30|$|According to {{the process}} of {{building}} earthquake damage information extraction shown in Fig.  3, the Wishart supervised classification method was performed on the PolSAR data after POA compensation. In the study area, the vegetation is very sparse and low level and can be ignored, so the non-buildings were mainly composed of bare areas. Therefore, the ground objects were classified into the four classes of bare areas, parallel undamaged buildings, oriented undamaged buildings, and collapsed buildings. We calculated the CRDbl–Vol for all of the samples of oriented buildings <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> buildings generated from the Wishart supervised classification <b>and</b> set <b>the</b> threshold value ε of CRDbl–Vol in Eq. (13) as 0.7 according to the difference of the Dbl–Vol values of <b>the</b> oriented buildings <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> buildings shown in Fig.  2. The two kinds of buildings were reclassified based on Eq. (13), as described in “Analysis of building scattering components in earthquake-stricken areas” section, and clustering based on the Wishart distance was performed on the initial classification results, <b>and</b> then, <b>the</b> final classification results of <b>the</b> oriented buildings <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> buildings were obtained. The oriented buildings together with the parallel buildings were considered to be the undamaged buildings.|$|R

5|$|Rosas' early {{administration}} was {{preoccupied with the}} severe deficits, large public debts {{and the impact of}} currency devaluation which his government inherited. A great drought that began in December 1828, which would last until April 1832, greatly impacted the economy. The Unitarians were still at large, controlling several provinces that had banded together in the Unitarian League. The capture of José María Paz, the main Unitarian leader, in March 1831 resulted in the end of the Unitarian–Federalist civil war <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of the Unitarian League.

5|$|The Action of 3 February 1812 was {{an unusual}} minor naval {{engagement}} off the western coast of Haiti between a British frigate and a frigate manned by a loose coalition of Haitian rebels. The battle was fought {{against the background of}} the Napoleonic Wars <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of government in Haiti {{in the aftermath of the}} Haitian Revolution eight years earlier. After the French had been expelled from Haiti in 1804, the newly independent nation was first ruled by Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who was murdered in 1806 and replaced by two of his advisors, Henri Christophe and Alexandre Pétion. These rulers divided the country between them and in the confused political situation that followed a number of minor fiefdoms appeared, including one led by Jérôme Maximilien Borgella in the south-west of the island called Sud. The small Haitian Navy defected to Borgella, who crewed the vessels with a collection of sailors from various countries, led by a notorious privateer named Gaspard.|$|E
5|$|The Royalist {{commander}} Prince Maurice conscripted {{the adult}} {{men and women}} of Worcester to work on the walls, threatening the death penalty if they did not attend. To form these new defences, the buildings outside the old city walls were cleared and six large bastions were attached to them along the north and east sides of the city, while a sconce, Fort Royal Hill was built outside Sidbury Gate in the south, linked to the walls by a walkway. The ditch protecting the new earthworks was relatively shallow at about eight feet (2.4 m) deep, but when combined with the high ramparts of the bastions, which were probably protected by sharpened stakes and a banquette firing platform, the bastions would have been well defended. During the short unsuccessfully siege 1643 and the long successful siege of 1646 the reinforced defences were able to withstand the artillery bombardments – the surrender in 1646 was mainly the result of a shortage of food <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of the wider Royalist position across the south-west of England.|$|E
