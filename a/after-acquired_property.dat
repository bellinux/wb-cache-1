500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the dehors theory is based on detective drafting of the Wills Act. In particular, whilst the term [...] "will" [...] is commonly used to refer to a specific document, the WIlls Act is designed to cover almost all documents except rules on public trust and secret trust that are to take effect after the testator's death. Indeed, the formality requirements of the Wills Act created the need for a set of prima facie documents, like the one commonly referred to. Therefore, to refer to an arrangement as dehor the Wills Act because it is not a prima facie reference to the document is incorrect. The response has been to view the secret trust as a disposition inter vivos ("between the living") rather than testamentary under exception. Although the testator is unlikely to consider the trust having come into existence {{at the time of the}} will upon his death, whether a disposition is arguably though less convincingly regarded as an inter vivos is a question for the courts as well as parliament. However, other types of inter vivos trust are incapable of binding <b>after-acquired</b> <b>property</b> or operating so as to, whether automatically, semi-automatically or no automatism at all, bind such property as and when it is received. No separate declaration of trust is required in the case of property acquired after the execution of a will for it to form part of a secret trust. Looking at the definition of a [...] "testamentary disposition" [...] and [...] "inter vivo trust" [...] as applied in other sorts of cases is inconclusive.|$|E
2500|$|The U.S. never {{adopted the}} {{floating}} charge directly {{because at the}} time it was developing in England in the 19th century, U.S. courts generally held that a debtor simply could not create a security interest in future property; general creditors ought to have a pool of unencumbered assets to look to; and even if such a thing could exist, it was a fraudulent conveyance. [...] However, creditors' lawyers gradually developed an diverse variety of methods, some authorized by state legislatures and others tolerated by state courts, to evade the general ban on security interests in future property.

50|$|James Buist, {{a farmer}} in Saskatchewan, {{borrowed}} {{money from the}} Innovation Credit Union in October 1991. In return, he provided the credit union with a security interest {{in all of his}} present and <b>after-acquired</b> personal <b>property,</b> which would be governed by the Personal Property Security Act (Saskatchewan). The interest was not entered into Saskatchewan's PPSA registry until June 2004.|$|R

50|$|Under the {{doctrine}} of Glass City Bank v.

50|$|The Roman will {{spoke from}} the time of making; the English speaks {{from the time}} of death.

50|$|On 14 January 1933 {{the company}} granted a {{debenture}} which contained an all-assets floating charge {{in favour of}} H. Yager (London) Limited as chargee. The debenture contained a fairly standard provision that the charge would also attach to any <b>after-acquired</b> <b>property</b> of the company. Pursuant to the debenture the chargee advanced the sume of £200 to the company.|$|E
50|$|Immovable {{property}} purchased {{during the}} marriage {{was considered to be}} <b>after-acquired</b> <b>property</b> (conquêts) and incorporated into the marital property but would become separate property as soon as the estate went into succession. The distinction between separate property (biens propres) and community property (biens communs, or biens de communauté) was very important; many limitations were imposed on the alienation of separate property.|$|E

50|$|Cessio bonorum (Latin for a {{surrender}} of goods), in Roman law, is a voluntary {{surrender of}} goods by a debtor to his creditors. It did not {{amount to a}} discharge unless the property ceded was sufficient for the purpose, but it secured the debtor from personal arrest. The creditors sold the goods as partial restoration of their claims. The procedure of cessio bonorum avoided infamy, and the debtor, though his <b>after-acquired</b> <b>property</b> might be proceeded against, could not be deprived of the bare necessaries of life. The main features of the Roman law of cessio bonorum were adopted in medieval law, Scots law, and also in French law.|$|E

5000|$|A {{security}} agreement may be oral if the secured party (the lender) has actual physical {{possession of the}} collateral. Where the collateral remains in the physical possession of the borrower, or where the collateral is intangible (such as a patent., accounts receivable, or a promissory note), the {{security agreement}} must be in writing {{in order to satisfy}} the statute of frauds. The security agreement must be authenticated by the debtor, meaning that it must either bear the debtor's signature, or it must be electronically marked. It must contain a reasonable description of the collateral, and must use words showing an intent to create a security interest (the right to seek repayment of the loan by foreclosing on the collateral). In order for the security agreement to be valid, the borrower must usually have rights in the collateral at the time the agreement is executed. If a borrower pledges as collateral a car owned by a neighbor, and the neighbor does not know of and endorse this pledge, then the security agreement is ineffective. However, a security agreement may specify that it includes <b>after-acquired</b> <b>property.</b> If such a specification is included, then a pledge of [...] "all automobiles owned by borrower" [...] would include the neighbor's car if the borrower were to buy that car from the neighbor.|$|E

50|$|The {{effect of}} these Acts was to make lands held in fee simple devisable by will in writing, {{to the extent of}} two-thirds where the tenure was by knight service, and the whole where it was in socage. Corporations were {{incapacitated}} to receive, and married women, infants, idiots and lunatics to devise. An Act of 1660, by abolishing tenure by knight service, made all lands devisable, in the same vein the Statute of Frauds (1677) dealt with the formalities of execution. Up to this time simple notes, even in the handwriting of another person, constituted a sufficient will, if published by the testator as such. The Statute of Frauds required, inter alia, that all devises should be in writing, signed by the testator or by some person for him in his presence and by his direction, and should also be subscribed by three or four credible witnesses. The strict interpretation by the courts of the credibility of witnesses led to the passing of an Act in 1751-1752, making interested witnesses sufficient for the due execution of the will, but declaring gifts to them void. The will of a man was revoked by marriage and the birth of a child, of a woman by marriage only. A will was also revoked by an alteration in circumstances, and even by a void conveyance inter vivos of land devised by the will made subsequently to the date of the will, which was presumed to be an attempt by the grantor to give legal effect to a change of intention. As in Roman law, a will spoke {{from the time of the}} making, so that it could not avail to pass <b>after-acquired</b> <b>property</b> without republication, which was equivalent to making a new will. Copyholds were not devisable before 1815, but were usually surrendered to the use of the will of the copyhold tenant; an act of 1815 made them devisable simply. Devises of lands have gradually been made liable to the claims of creditors by a series of statutes beginning with the year 1691.|$|E

40|$|Case law {{under the}} Former Act {{provided}} nearly absolute protection to perfected security interests attaching to collateral during the preference period pursuant to <b>after-acquired</b> <b>property</b> clauses in valid pre-existing security agreements. The Bankruptcy Reform Act replaced this case law with a legislative compromise that first treats most, if not all, security interests attaching to after-acquired collateral within ninety days of bankruptcy as preferences, and then exempts from preference attack security interests in inventory and receivables collateral {{to the extent}} that the floating lien financer has not improved its secured position at the end of the ninety-day period. Although section 547 (c) (5) is capable of complex applications, it is, in general, an efficient and workable response to the perceived unfairness of the case law under the Former Act. This article has discussed certain factual situations which, when analyzed under section 547 (c) (5), may produce results not clearly in accord with fundamental notions of bankruptcy preference policy. However, purposive construction of section 547 (c) (5) by the courts and creative lawyering by counsel for floating lien financers could eliminate most, if not all, of these difficulties. Finally, the article suggests that Congress consider amending section 547 (c) (5) by adding a good faith requirement designed to eliminate potential secured party abuse of the two-point improvement in position test...|$|E
40|$|Every law {{teacher and}} many law {{students}} and practitioners understand the intellectual sport {{to be found}} in Section 547 on preference law. Because the preference rules are so intricate, rigorously logical-but really not logical-they command more than their fair attention, not only in law school but also in continuing legal education and even in the courts. Our purpose in this article is not to answer any of the difficult questions or to give a global explanation of preference law. Rather it is to confront a few of the conundrums in Section 547 and to follow the paths of those conundrums a little farther into the bush than have others. We concentrate on four preference problems. The first is the application of 547 (c) (5), the exception for <b>after-acquired</b> <b>property.</b> Second, we examine the vitality of the old arguments that were used where 547 (c) (5) is now used. Surprisingly some parts of those have survived the enactment of the 1978 Code. Next we deal with the question when is the hypothetical date of liquidation under (b) (5) and we conclude with a first cousin of the Deprizio issue-the issues arising when a payment to one creditor arguably causes a preference to another. Those interested in answers should not look here. This is for those interested in playing in the complexities of preference law...|$|E
