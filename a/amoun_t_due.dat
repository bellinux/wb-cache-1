However, investments in agricultural water devel opment have largely ignored the livestock sector, resulting in or sub-optimal investment returns because the benefits of livestock were not considered and low-cost live stock-related interventions, such as provision of veterinary care, {{were not part of}} water budgets and planning. livestock and crop development in the context of agricultural water development will often increase water productivity and avoid animal induced land and water degradation. Under current management practices, livestock production and productivity cannot meet projected demands for animal products and services in the Nile Basin. Given the relative of water and the large <b>amoun</b> <b>ts</b> already used for agriculture, increased livestock water productivity (LWP) is needed over large areas of the basin.

Paterae, {{defined by}} the International Astronomical Union as {{irregular}} crater[s], or complex one[s] with scalloped edges, {{are some of the}} most prominent topographic fea-tures on Io. Paterae on Io are unique, yet in some aspects they resemble calderas known and studied on Earth, Mars, and Venus. They have steep walls, flat floors, and arcuate mar-gins and sometimes exhibit nesting, all typical of terrestrial and Martian basalt shield calde-ras. However, they are much larger, many are irregular in shape, and they typically lack shields. Their great sizes (some> 200 km diameter) and lack of associated volcanic edifices beg comparison with terrestrial ash flow calderas; however, there is no convincing evidence on Io for the high-silica erupted products or dome resurgence associated with this type of caldera.

40|$|AbstractWith the {{perspective}} of long term CO 2 storage, thermodynamic data are necessary for the simulations of CO 2 injection in aquifers of depleted oil reservoirs. We focus here on {{the determination of the}} resistivity and viscosi ty of aqueous NaCl solutions with dissolved CO 2. It is well known that dissolved CO 2 increases slightly the water density. Recently, Bando et al. (2004) measured the viscosity of CO 2 saturated brines and found an increase of viscosity with increasing <b>amoun</b> <b>t</b> of dissolved CO 2. For resistivity, no data is available to our knowledge. We evaluated the effect of dissolved CO 2 simultaneously on the resistivity and viscosity of three NaCl solutions covering the range of salinity usually encountered in potential CO 2 storage geological formations. At a constant temperature of 35  ∘C, we show that the variation of resistivity and viscosity are proportional to the amount of dissolved CO 2. For viscosity, our data are in agreement with previous observations. The observed variations are small, at maximum of the order of 10 %. The increase of viscosity is well correlated with the variation of conductivity because ions are moving in a more viscous solvent and th erefore conductivity decreases. For the temperature dependence, w e used the Arps model to describe the measured variation of conductivity as a function of temperature. We propose a simple model {{to take into account the}} small modifications of conductivity and viscosity as a function of the dissolved CO 2 fraction and temperature. Finally, we examine two potential impact s of these findings...|$|R
