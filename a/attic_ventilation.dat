40|$|Abstract in Undetermined Between {{one and two}} school fires {{occur in}} Sweden every day. In most cases, arson {{is the cause of}} the fire. The most severe fires {{generally}} start outside the building and spread up along the façade and into the <b>attic</b> through <b>ventilation</b> openings in the eaves. Linear heat detectors can be placed on façades to detect these types of fires. Such devices detect fire when short-circuited at a specific temperature. In this article, an attempt to simulate linear heat detectors is presented. Data from small-scale and full-scale experiments are compared with these simulations. The small-scale experiments and simulations demonstrate that the cable failure model in Fire Dynamics Simulator can be used to predict detection in linear heat detectors that use short-circuiting as the means of signaling an overheated condition. The full-scale experiments provide a measure of the uncertainties involved, as well as the possibility of using simulations of linear heat detectors in a fire engineering design...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to durability and expense, Wright incorporated {{such factors as}} thermal comfort into the design. First, he indicated that concrete construction would keep the house cooler {{in the summer and}} warmer in the winter. Concrete walls have greater thermal mass than walls of wood, and thereby lessen temperature fluctuations during the day and throughout the year. Furthermore, the roof overhang would have reduced overheating by shading part of the walls in summer. A third feature was perhaps the most innovative: Wright specified that the ceilings for the second floor rooms be installed eight inches below the roof slab. The resulting air space was to be fed by vents beneath the eaves and exhausted through the chimney to create a constant stream of moving air. Modern homes often use a similar soffit and ridge vent combination to keep the attic and the floor below cooler. Yet, at the time of publication, most wood houses lacked <b>attic</b> <b>ventilation</b> because buildings were not constructed as tightly as those built in recent years. The monolithic construction of the Fireproof House would have prevented most natural air infiltration, making the ventilated air space a necessity.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{elements}} of all structures trends to remain same. The base model is normally circular, square or rectangular plain shapes with a ribbed roof evolved from functional consideration. The most distinctive visual form of Kerala architecture is the long, steep sloping roof built {{to protect the}} house’s walls and to withstand the heavy monsoon, normally laid with tiles or thatched labyrinth of palm leaves, supported on a roof frame made of hard wood and timber. Structurally the roof frame was supported on the pillars on walls erected on a plinth raised from the ground for protection against dampness and insects in the tropical climate. Often the walls were also of timbers abundantly available in Kerala. Gable windows were evolved at the two ends to provide <b>attic</b> <b>ventilation</b> when ceiling was incorporated for the room spaces.The science of Vastu plays {{a very important role}} in developing architecture styles. The basic concept underlines that, every structure built on earth has its own life, with a soul and personality which is shaped by its surroundings. The most important science which has Kerala has developed purely indigenously is Thachu-Shastra (Science of Carpentry) as the easily availability of timber and its heavy use of it. The concept of Thachi underlines that as timber is derived from a living form, the wood, when used for construction, has its own life which must be synthesized in harmony with its surroundings and people whom dwell inside it.|$|E
40|$|Damages, {{caused by}} {{moisture}} and mould, in cold attics {{have increased in}} Sweden during the last decades. The main reasons are thicker thermal insulation between the living space and the attic and lack of the heat and ventilation effects from a warm chimney. Cold attics are ventilated to avoid that heat leakage from the living space heats up the outer roof with snow melting and icicles as result. With reduced heat flux from the living space the original purpose of the ventilation is not valid any more. There can be other reasons to ventilate the attic, for example {{to take away the}} humid air that can be transported to the attic from the living space trough diffusion and moisture convection. Also water from small and occasional water leakage can be removed from the <b>attic</b> by the <b>ventilation.</b> There can also be disadvantages with ventilation. The wind pressure against the building can sometimes cause a negative pressure in the attic, which increases the moisture convection from the living space into the attic. During clear cold nights the heat radiation from the roof into the sky could lead to that the temperature at the inner side of the roof gets lower than outside, which increases the risk for condensation or high relative humidity. This paper presents field measurements and results from four different concepts to increase the moisture safety in cold attics. <b>Attics</b> with reduced <b>ventilation,</b> internal heat source, thin thermal insulation of the outer roof, and reduced ventilation combined with new types of underlay with reduced resistance to moisture flux are discussed and compared with calculations and a reference house...|$|R
40|$|Tougher fire {{requirements}} {{and the desire}} to make simpler designs have enabled construction companies to go from the traditional well-ventilated attic to <b>attic</b> with limited <b>ventilation.</b> Theoretically limited ventilated winds should perform well. The problem you see if there is construction moisture or external moisture sources. Problems may occur when the small ventilation is not able to remove moisture to the extent necessary. Heavier constructions usually have a large amount of construction moisture in the attic floor, which can be transferred to the attic space. Heavier structures with limited ventilated attics have not been studied previously. AK Consulting was commissioned to evaluate five attics to a construction company erected in 2014 and 2015. Former investigations showed that there was a risk initially with respect to the excess moisture from building moisture. This study was carried out with theoretical calculations on a model of an existing attic with moisture problems. The present thesis was commissioned by AK Consulting. It evaluated the data and reports from the five attics and assesses them with the help of WUFI BIO and made theoretical calculations in WUFI. The study shows that <b>attics</b> with limited <b>ventilations</b> work well initially and that the <b>ventilation</b> of the <b>attic</b> does not lead to drier attics. Longer measurement periods are required in order to see how the wind works in the long term and in different outdoor climates. It is difficult to determine the effect of initial dehumidification of the winds. The attics have little or no excess moisture over the measurement period. The recommendations are to dehumidify attics initially until further studies have been done on similar structures. It is also important to continue monitoring the attics in this study to follow up how they work in the long term and during years with different climatic conditions...|$|R

50|$|The {{evolution}} of domestic architecture of Kerala followed closely {{the trend of}} development in temple architecture. The primitive models were huts made of bamboo frame thatched with leaves in circular, square or rectangular plain shapes. The rectangular shape with a hipped roof {{appears to have been}} finally evolved from functional consideration. Structurally the roof frame was supported on the pillars on walls erected on a plinth raised from the ground for protection against dampness and insects in the tropical climate. Often the walls were also of timbers abundantly available in the land. The roof frame consisted of the bressumer or wall plate which supported lower ends of the rafters, the upper ends being connected to the ridge. The weight of the rafters and the roof covering created a sage in the ridge when the ridge piece was made of flexible materials like bamboo. This sage however remained as the hall-mark of roof construction even when strong timber was used for the roof frame. Further gable windows were evolved at the two ends to provide <b>attic</b> <b>ventilation</b> when ceiling was incorporated for the room spaces. This ensured air circulation and thermal control for the roof. The lower ends of the rafters projected much beyond the walls to shade the walls from the sun and driving rain. The closed form of the Kerala houses was thus gradually evolved from technical considerations. One can see the striking similarity of this form with the temple structure. The plinth, the lower most part is still called adisthana, though it is plain or less ornate. The sthambas or pillars and bhithis or walls are again of simple shape with no projection or recesses. The main door faces only in one cardinal direction and the windows are small and are made like pierced screens of wood. The rectangular plan is usually divided into two or three activity rooms with access from a front passage. The projecting caves cover a verandah all round. By tenth century, the theory and practice of domestic architecture were codified in books such as Manushyalaya Chandrika and Vastu vidya. This attempt standardized the house construction suited to different socio-economic groups and strengthens the construction tradition among the craftsmen. The traditional craftsman, specially carpenters, preserved the knowledge by rigidly following the canonical rules of proportions of different elements as well as the construction details to this day.Basically the domestic architecture of Kerala follows the style of detached building; row houses seen in other parts of India are neither mentioned in Kerala texts nor put up in practice except in settlements (sanketam) occupied by Tamil or Konkini Brahmans. In its most developed form the typical Kerala house is a courtyard type - nalukettu. The central courtyard is an outdoor living space which may house some object of cult worship such as a raised bed for tulssi or jasmine (mullathara). The four halls enclosing the courtyard, identical to the nalambalam of the temple, may be divided into several rooms for different activities such as cooking, dining, sleeping, studying, storage of grains etc. Depending on the size and importance of the household the building may have one or two upper storeys (malika) or further enclosed courtyard by repetition of the nalukettu to form ettukettu (eight halled building) or a cluster of such courtyards.|$|E

Then a TE tile of 0. 1656 m(2) surface area was designed based on the laboratory made TE module. In total 414 modules were used. Two TE tiles were considered sufficient to generate a 5 V electrical current to drive two small DC fans. Heat gain reduction due to the induced TE <b>attic</b> <b>ventilation</b> was estimated using the TRNSYS program for a regular house in Thailand. It was found that the TE tiles could induce an air ventilation rate of about 100 - 250 m(3) /h. The average daily percentage of total rate of heat gain reduction through the ceiling during 9 - 17 h was about 14 - 18 %.

40|$|Residential attics has the {{potential}} to be one of the most energy efficient building components by combining thermal processes of attic floor insulation, <b>attic</b> air space, <b>ventilation</b> in <b>attics,</b> and solar collecting roof decks. Large amounts of solar energy collected by the roofs in cooling-dominated and mixed climates generate excess cooling loads, which need to be removed from the building by the space conditioning systems. This paper investigates potential ways to improve the thermal design of the residential home attics to minimize the cooling energy consumption in the cooling-dominated and mixed climates. Dynamic thermal characteristics of thick attic floor insulations and blends of phase change materials (PCMs) with insulations are analyzed. Both approaches can provide notable reductions of thermal loads at the attic level. In addition, a significant time shift of peak-hour loads can move a major operation time for air conditioning system from the daytime peak hours to nighttime low demand hours. A reverse heat flow direction can be observed during the day in the case of really thick layers of bulk insulation or PCM-enhanced insulations, compared to the rest of the building envelope components. This effect may provide free passive cooling to the building, and can be very useful in locations of double electrical tariffs with high daytime peak-hour electric energy rates and less-expensive off-peak energy cost. In both of the above cases, an addition of PCM to the bulk insulation brings substantial performance enhancement not available for traditional insulation applications. This paper presents a short overview of dynamic material characteristics and energy performance data necessary for future dynamic applications of different configurations of the attic floor insulation and PCM-insulation blends in residential homes.

40|$|AbstractAttic air {{ventilation}} can {{be influenced by}} various vent considerations.

Most existing building codes do have a minimum requirement for venting parameters and type and thickness of the insulation used. In this paper, the effect of insulation thickness in <b>attic</b> <b>ventilation</b> rate, attic air temperature and heating and cooling loads in a mild climatic zone is studied. A typical mild climate summer and winter temperatures and solar radiations data are used for 24 hours transient conjugate heat transfer simulations. Results show that solar radiation has significant impact on the amount and the pattern of airflow in attic. An increase in attic insulation yields a decrease in <b>attic</b> <b>ventilation</b> during winter period, but has no effect in summer period for the climate considered.

40|$|Attic Performance of a South Minneapolis HomeIce dams {{occur on}} cold climate roofs when warm zones {{on the roof}} melt snow, and cold spots {{simultaneously}} freeze the water into large ice formations, typically found on eaves. This {{is a result of}} improper air sealing and attic insulation, insufficient <b>attic</b> <b>ventilation,</b> and an assortment of design and construction flaws in new and old homes. Attic bypass in the winter relates to escaping heat from conditioned portions of the house into the attic {{as a result of an}} inadequate vapor and thermal barrier separating the two zones. Inadequate <b>attic</b> <b>ventilation</b> perpetuates ice dams by failing to cool the roof deck and venting moisture out. Non-vented warm and moist air can melt snow unevenly, and in extreme cases lead to frost in the attic. This fate causes a home durability issue, and can remain unfixed for years without proper diagnostics and solutions. This research will quantify and analyze attic bypass and air sealing effectiveness using zone pressure diagnostics and blower door testing on a South Minneapolis home.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to develop new techniques for designing and operating unconditioned buildings in a hot-humid climate that could contribute to an improvement of thermal performance and comfort condition. The recommendations proposed in {{this research}} will also be useful for facility managers on how to maintain unconditioned buildings in this climate. This study investigated two unconditioned Thai Buddhist temples located in the urban area of Bangkok, Thailand. One is a 100 -year-old, high-mass temple. The other is a 5 -year-old, lower-mass temple. The indoor measurements revealed that the thermal condition inside both temples exceed the ASHRAE-recommended comfort zone. Surprisingly, the older temple maintained a more comfortable indoor condition due to its thermal inertia, shading, and earth contacts. A baseline thermal and airflow model of the old temple was established using a calibrated computer simulation method. To accomplish this, HEATX, a 3 -D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code, was coupled with the DOE- 2 thermal simulation program. HEATX was used to calculate the airflow rate and the surface convection coefficients for DOE- 2, and DOE- 2 was used to provide physical input variables to form the boundary conditions for HEATX. In this way calibrated DOE- 2 /CFD simulation model was accomplished, and the baseline model was obtained. To investigate an improved design, four design options were studied: 1) a reflective or low-solar absorption roof, 2) R- 30 ceiling insulation, 3) shading devices, and 4) <b>attic</b> <b>ventilation.</b> Each was operated using three modes of ventilation. The low-absorption roof and the R- 30 ceiling insulation options were found to be the most effective options, whereas the shading devices and <b>attic</b> <b>ventilation</b> were less effective options, regardless of which ventilation mode was applied. All design options performed much better when nighttime-only ventilation was used. Based on this analysis, two prototype temples was proposed (i. e., low-mass and high-mass temples).

40|$|The {{degradation}} of wood treated with fire retardant (FR) chemicals in roof systems {{is a problem}} of major national significance. Understanding of this phenomenon is limited by lack of information on how the performance of FR-treated wood in the laboratory correlates to that of FR-treated wood in the field. In this study, five outdoor field exposure cham-bers were constructed near Madison, Wisconsin, in the sum-mer of 1991. These structures were intended to simulate the “attics ” of multifamily structures for which model building codes sometimes allow the use of FR-treated roof sheathing. Interior attic air, exterior air, inner and outer sheathing, and internal rafter temperatures of black- and white-shingled chambers were monitored. Temperatures were measured using thermocouples and recorded over a 3 -year period from October 1991 through September 1994 using a datalogger/multiplexer device. Overall, the plywood sheathing in black-shingled roof systems tended to be 10 ˚F to 15 ˚F (5 ˚C to 8 ˚C) warmer dur-ing the midafternoon of a sunny day than the plywood in comparable white-shingled roof systems. The maximum sheathing temperatures recorded were 168 ˚F (76 ˚C) for black-shingled roofs and 147 ˚F (64 ˚C) for white-shingled roofs. The results suggest that roof-sheathing plywood and roof-truss lumber temperatures, which are the primary factors that influence thermal degrade of FR-treated materials, are primar-ily controlled by solar gain rather than <b>attic</b> <b>ventilation</b> or attic insulation.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the influence of convection on the thermal performance of loose-fill attic insulation under realistic climate conditions. In order to achieve this, a large-scale attic test model has been constructed in a climate chamber. Heat flows through the attic floor have been determined with a metering box and temperatures on the upper and lower surface of the attic floor have been measured to detect air movements and to determine the thermal resistance of the attic floor. The performance of the attic test model has been assured by gradually increasing the complexity of the studied attic floor. Measurements have been made both with and without joists, with and without <b>attic</b> <b>ventilation</b> and on rockwool boards, rockwool loose-fill insulation and low-density, glasswool loose-fill insulation. The upper surface of the attic floor has been subjected to conditions representing Swedish winter and the lower surface to indoor conditions. When natural convection occurs, it leads to an increase in heat loss through the insulation and, thus, to a decrease in the thermal resistance of the insulation. A number of factors influence natural convection, such as temperature difference over the attic floor, the thickness of the insulation and permeability of the insulation material. Measurements of natural convection showed that the critical modified Rayleigh number for attic insulation, in the studied set-up, was approximately 22. At a modified Rayleigh number of 34, the thermal resistance of the insulation in the attic test model was only 75 % of that obtained at the onset of convection. This means that there was a substantial increase in heat loss through the insulation due to convection. The measurements of natural convection have been compared to simulations and similar tendencies were obtained.

The FRF is a 1, 152 square foot (107 m 2) building with six roof adjacent test cells which are heavily insulated from each other. Some 233 channels of data were obtained; this includes twenty temperature measurements per cell, extensive meteorological conditions, surface and tower wind speeds and attic humidity and roof surface moisture accumulation. The {{data were collected}} over the ASHRAE definition of summer (June- September) to compare cooling season thermal of roofing systems. Six differing roof types were evaluated with variations in color, ventilation, roof mass {{and the use of}} radiant barrier systems (RBS). The tests show that roof system reflectivity greatly influences attic summer temperatures. Two white roofing systems outperformed the other options. Another large improvement comes from greater roof mass; tiled roofs performed better than those with asphalt shingled roofs. An increased <b>attic</b> <b>ventilation</b> rate improved the effectiveness of an attic radiant barrier. Of the evaluated options white tile roof best controlled attic heat gain...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates numerically the {{occurrence}} {{and duration of}} higher relative humidities in a cold attic space, which are {{a consequence of the}} excessive moisture supply from the ventilation of the attic and from the infiltration of air from a dwelling. Hygrothermal states of the attic air zone and of the adjacent construction elements are calculated by a whole building heat, air and moisture simulation tool. Airflows to the attic are determined by taking into account the total distribution of pressure around and inside a building. The role of the <b>attic</b> <b>ventilation</b> is analyzed by comparing naturally ventilated and unventilated attics in an open landscape or in a city zone. For the air infiltration from the dwelling only scenarios with the airflow directed mostly to the attic are analyzed. The simulations show that, if indoor air infiltrates through the attic floor, it is necessary to ventilate the attic. In that case, a building situated in a sheltered position is more susceptible to moisture problems in the cold attic compared to the same building in an unsheltered position. However, {{in the absence of the}} air infiltration from the dwelling, the attic should not be ventilated. Simulations are performed for real climatic conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{impacts of}} {{ventilation}} ratio and vent balance on cooling load and air flow of naturally ventilated attics are studied {{in this paper}} using an unsteady computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Buoyancy-driven turbulent ventilations in attics of gable-roof residential buildings are simulated for typical summer conditions. Ventilation ratios from 1 / 400 to 1 / 25 combined with both balanced and unbalanced vent configurations are investigated. The modeling {{results show that the}} air flows in the attics are steady and exhibit a general streamline pattern that is qualitatively insensitive to the variations in ventilation ratio and vent configuration. The predicted temperature fields are characterized by thermal stratification, except for the soffit regions. It is demonstrated that an increase in ventilation ratio will reduce attic cooling load. Compared with unbalanced vent configurations, balanced <b>attic</b> <b>ventilation</b> is shown to be the optimal solution in both maximizing ventilating flow rate and minimizing cooling load for attics with ventilation ratio lower than 1 / 100. For attics with ventilation ratios greater than 1 / 67, a configuration of large ridge vent with small soffit vent favors ventilating air flow enhancement, while a configuration of small ridge vent with large soffit vent results in the lowest cooling energy consumption...|$|E
40|$|A utility {{monitoring}} {{project has}} evaluated radiant barrier systems (RBS) {{as a new}} potential demand site management (DSM) program. The study examined how the retrofit of attic radiant barriers {{can be expected to}} alter utility residential space conditioning loads. An RBS consists of a layer of aluminum foil fastened to roof decking or roof trusses to block radiant heat transfer between the hot roof surface and the attic below. The radiant barrier can significantly lower summer heat transfer to the attic insulation and to the cooling duct system. Both of these mechanisms have strong potential impacts on cooling energy use as illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. The pilot project involved installation of RBS in nine homes that had been extensively monitored over the preceding year. The houses varied in conditioned floor area from 939 to 2, 440 square feet; attic insulation varied from R- 9 to R- 30. The homes had shingle roofs with varying degrees of <b>attic</b> <b>ventilation.</b> The radiant barriers were installed during the summer of 2000. Data analysis on the pre and post cooling and heating consumption was used to determine impacts on energy use and peak demand for the utility. The average cooling energy savings from the RBS retrofit was 3. 6 kWh/day, or about 9 %. The average reduction in summer afternoon peak demand was 420 watts (or about 16 %) ...|$|E
