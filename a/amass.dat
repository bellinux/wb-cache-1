5|$|Following the war's end, only 400 {{out of the}} library's nearly 3,000 volumes {{could be}} recovered, with only 200 of those books {{remaining}} on the library's shelves.

5|$|In {{the early}} Western Han, a wealthy salt or iron industrialist, whether a {{semi-autonomous}} king or wealthy merchant, could boast funds that rivaled the imperial treasury and <b>amass</b> a peasant workforce of over a thousand. This kept many peasants {{away from their}} farms and denied the government {{a significant portion of}} its land tax revenue. To eliminate the influence of such private entrepreneurs, Emperor Wu nationalized the salt and iron industries in 117 BC and allowed many of the former industrialists to become officials administering the monopolies. By Eastern Han times, the central government monopolies were repealed in favor of production by commandery and county administrations, as well as private businessmen.|$|E

After six weeks, the North Korean force collapsed and retreated in defeat after the UN force launched a counterattack at Inchon on September 15.
