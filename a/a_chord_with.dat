5|$|George Reid {{adopted a}} {{strategy}} of trying to reorient the party system along Labour vs non-Labour lines – prior to the 1906 election, he renamed his Free Trade Party to the Anti-Socialist Party. Reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti-socialist, with the Protectionist Party in the middle. This attempt struck <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> <b>with</b> politicians who were steeped in the Westminster tradition and regarded a two-party system as very much the norm.|$|E
5|$|By 1876, Macdonald and the Conservatives {{had adopted}} {{protection}} as party policy. This view was widely promoted in speeches {{at a number}} of political picnics, held across Ontario during the summer of 1876. Macdonald's proposals struck <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> <b>with</b> the public, and the Conservatives began to win a string of by-elections. By the end of 1876, the Tories had picked up 14seats as a result of by-elections, reducing Mackenzie's Liberal majority from 70 to 42. Despite the success, Macdonald considered retirement, wishing only to reverse the voters' verdict of 1874—he considered Charles Tupper his heir apparent.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Bosch's work enjoyed a popular resurrection. The early surrealists' fascination with dreamscapes, the {{autonomy}} of the imagination, and a free-flowing connection to the unconscious brought about a renewed interest in his work. Bosch's imagery struck <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> <b>with</b> Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí in particular. Both knew his paintings firsthand, having seen The Garden of Earthly Delights in the Museo del Prado, and both regarded him as an art-historical mentor. Miró's The Tilled Field contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work. Dalí's 1929 The Great Masturbator is similar to an image {{on the right side of}} the left panel of Bosch's Garden, composed of rocks, bushes and little animals resembling a face with a prominent nose and long eyelashes.|$|E

2500|$|This <b>chord</b> is <b>an</b> {{extended}} 9th <b>chord</b> <b>with</b> the 3rd {{replaced by}} the 4th (C-F–G–B–D). However, the major third can be added as a tension above the 4th to [...] "colorize" [...] the <b>chord</b> (C-F–G–B–D–E). <b>A</b> sus4 <b>chord</b> <b>with</b> the added major third (sometimes called a major 10th) can also be quartally voiced as C–F–B–E.|$|R
2500|$|Another [...] "accented" [...] {{chromatic}} chord {{frequently used}} by march music composers is an inversion of <b>a</b> I <b>chord</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lowered third and raised fifth. For example, {{if there was}} <b>an</b> E♭ major <b>chord</b> (the I in the key of E♭), it would be followed by <b>a</b> B major <b>chord</b> (because <b>a</b> B <b>chord</b> is <b>an</b> E♭ <b>chord</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lowered third and raised fifth). Unlike the aforementioned secondary dominants, this chord really does not have logical harmonic functions to it (besides neighbor tone usage) other than to add texture and interest.|$|R
25|$|The modernist 'revolution of the word' was {{not universally}} welcomed, either by readers or writers. Certainly by the 1930s, a new {{generation}} of poets had emerged who looked to more formally conservative poets like Thomas Hardy and W.B. Yeats as models and these writers struck <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> <b>with</b> a readership who were uncomfortable with the experimentation and uncertainty preferred by the modernists. Notwithstanding, modernist poetry cannot be positively characterised, there being no mainstream or dominant mode.|$|E
25|$|In 1898, {{the social}} {{reformer}} Ebenezer Howard {{wrote a book}} entitled To-morrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform (later republished as Garden Cities of To-morrow), in which he advocated {{the construction of a}} new kind of town, summed up in his Three Magnets diagram as combining the advantages of cities and the countryside while eliminating their disadvantages. Industry would be kept separate from residential areas—such zoning was a new idea at the time—and trees and open spaces would prevail everywhere. His ideas were mocked in the press but struck <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> <b>with</b> many, especially members of the Arts and Crafts movement and the Quakers.|$|E

An electric wheel motor concept that struck <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> <b>with</b> Quebecers, first prototyped in 1994 by Pierre Couture, an engineer and physicist working at IREQ, is one of these. The heir to the Couture wheel motor is now marketed by TM4 Electrodynamic Systems, a spin-off established in 1998 that has made deals with France's Dassault and Heuliez to develop an electric car, the Cleanova, of which prototypes were built in 2006. Hydro-Québec announced in early 2009 at the Montreal International Auto Show that its engine had been chosen by Tata Motors to equip a demonstration version of its Indica model, which will be road tested in Norway.|$|E

25|$|A chance {{meeting with}} Australian film producer, Colin Bromley while in New Delhi, {{resulted}} in Bobby Cash {{being invited to}} the Tamworth Country Music Festival in New South Wales, Australia. Having heard him sing, and being impressed by his musicianship, Bromley, producer/director of Sydney-based television production house, Gobsmacked and Gerry O'Leary, Gobsmacked's head of production, {{decided to make a}} film on Bobby Cash performing in the Festival and see what happened there. Thus, in January 2003, Bobby Cash went to perform in the Tamworth Country Music Festival.An unknown, Bobby Cash struck <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> <b>with</b> the country music lovers there and grabbed the attention of the media. A local wealthy farmer, Roy Eykamp, came forward and offered to finance Bobby Cash's debut country music albumWhat happened at the Festival, and Bobby Cash rising from being an unknown to celebrity status became the subject of Bromley's documentary film, The Indian Cowboy...One in a Billion.|$|E
25|$|A seminal {{moment in}} Iorga's {{political}} career {{took place during}} the 1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt, erupting under a Conservative cabinet and repressed with much violence by a National Liberal one. The bloody outcome prompted the historian to author and make public a piece of social critique, the Neamul Românesc pamphlet Dumnezeu să-i ierte ("God Forgive Them"). The text, together with his program of agrarian conferences and his subscription lists for the benefit of victims' relatives again made him an adversary of the National Liberals, who referred to Iorga as an instigator. The historian did however struck <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> <b>with</b> Stere, who had been made prefect of Iași County, and who, going against his party's wishes, inaugurated an informal collaboration between Iorga and the Poporanists. The political class as a whole was particularly apprehensive of Iorga's contacts with the Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians and their common irredentist agenda, which risked undermining relations with the Austrians over Transylvania and Bukovina. However, Iorga's popularity was still increasing, and, carried by this sentiment, he was first elected to Chamber during the elections of that same year.|$|E
25|$|As much as {{involving}} {{itself in}} designs for industry, the Constructivists worked on public festivals and street {{designs for the}} post-October revolution Bolshevik government. Perhaps {{the most famous of}} these was in Vitebsk, where Malevich's UNOVIS Group painted propaganda plaques and buildings (the best known being El Lissitzky's poster Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge (1919)). Inspired by Vladimir Mayakovsky's declaration 'the streets our brushes, the squares our palettes', artists and designers participated in public life during the Civil War. A striking instance was the proposed festival for the Comintern congress in 1921 by Alexander Vesnin and Liubov Popova, which resembled the constructions of the OBMOKhU exhibition as well as their work for the theatre. There {{was a great deal of}} overlap during this period between Constructivism and Proletkult, the ideas of which concerning the need to create an entirely new culture struck <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> <b>with</b> the Constructivists. In addition some Constructivists were heavily involved in the 'ROSTA Windows', a Bolshevik public information campaign of around 1920. Some of the most famous of these were by the poet-painter Vladimir Mayakovsky and Vladimir Lebedev.|$|E

25|$|The British artist potter Bernard Leach {{brought to}} England many ideas he had {{developed}} in Japan with the social critic Yanagi Soetsu about the moral and social value of simple crafts; both were enthusiastic readers of Ruskin. Leach was an active propagandist for these ideas, which struck <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> <b>with</b> practitioners of the crafts in the inter-war years, and he expounded them in his book The Art of the Potter, published in 1940, which denounced industrial society in terms as vehement as those of Ruskin and Morris. Thus the Arts and Crafts philosophy was perpetuated among British craft workers in the 1950s and 1960s, long after {{the demise of the}} Arts and Crafts movement and at the high tide of Modernism. British Utility furniture of the 1940s also derived from Arts and Crafts principles. One of its main promoters, Gordon Russell, chairman of the Utility Furniture Design Panel, was imbued with Arts and Crafts ideas. He manufactured furniture in the Cotswold Hills, a region of Arts and Crafts furniture-making since Ashbee, and {{he was a member of}} the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society. William Morris's biographer, Fiona MacCarthy, detected the Arts and Crafts philosophy even behind the Festival of Britain (1951), the work of the designer Terence Conran (b. 1931) and the founding of the British Crafts Council in the 1970s.|$|E

Lansbury argues that the Brown Dog affair became a matter of opposing symbols, the iconography of vivisection striking <b>a</b> <b>chord</b> <b>with</b> women.
