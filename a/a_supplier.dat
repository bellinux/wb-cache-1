5|$|Anthony Anthony {{has been}} {{identified}} as the compiler of the information and the artist behind the illustrations through his signature, which has been compared with holograph letters among the State Papers. Anthony's father was William Anthony (died 1535) a Fleming from Middelburg in Zeeland who migrated to England in 1503. William was <b>a</b> <b>supplier</b> of beer to the army, and Anthony followed in his father's footsteps. He went into beer exporting no later than 1530 and became <b>a</b> <b>supplier</b> of beer to the navy. In 1533 Anthony was appointed gunner at the Tower of London, a position he retained nominally until his death. He rose to the rank of overseer of the Ordnance Office, the government body responsible for supplying the armed forces with artillery, and it was in this position that he compiled his Roll. In 1549 he was promoted to master surveyor of the ordnance in the Tower, Calais, Boulogne, and elsewhere for life. He continued the work of supplying arms to English forces, and was active in the last month of his life supplying guns for an expedition against Le Havre.|$|E

After receiving the request, W. J.

40|$|Building a {{long-term}} relationship by committing to source from <b>a</b> single <b>supplier</b> over time may place a buyer at a disadvantage. With commitment, the buyer foregoes the option of switching to <b>a</b> new <b>supplier,</b> which is beneficial if the efficiency improvement {{is greater than the}} associated costs of switching. On the other hand, competition among suppliers may increase if the buyer commits to source from the winning <b>supplier</b> over <b>a</b> long term, which is advantageous for the buyer. We consider the value of commitment in an environment where the supplier operates capacity that is owned by the buyer, the buyer faces uncertainty about the downstream market demand, and <b>a</b> <b>supplier’s</b> production cost is private information. The buyer thus uses buffer capacity to hedge against market uncertainty and a competitive bidding process to elicit <b>a</b> <b>supplier’s</b> cost. We analyze when the buyer should commit to source from <b>a</b> single <b>supplier</b> over <b>a</b> long term, and show that there exists a critical level of switching costs above which the buyer should commit to <b>a</b> single <b>supplier.</b> Furthermore, we find that with commitment, capacity can be either higher or lower than without commitment. Finally, we find that when market uncertainty increases, commitment is optimal over a wider range of switching costs. 1 1...|$|R

5|$|While {{supporting}} change, Trường Chinh in his Political Report {{talked about}} the validity of the party's organizational principles, which had governed Vietnam's economy. Democratic centralism was to remain unchanged, and centralized management of certain sectors were to be retained. In a closed session, the Presidium of the 6th National Congress on 18 December acknowledged the importance of the continued transformation of private industry and commerce and the validity of economic contracts between production and business units. He endorsed the state's role as <b>a</b> <b>supplier</b> of goods produced by state-owned enterprises and supported the long-time policy of labour distribution. These policies were passed, and underwrote the economic policies initiated at the 4th and 5th National Congresses. The party leadership's immediate goals set forth in the Political Report were: To restructure the production system; readjust the investment outlay within the system; continue the building and strengthening of the socialist relations of production; to utilize and develop the economic sectors in the correct way; to renovate the way economy was managed; to emphasize the role of science and technology in the economy; and to expand and to increase the effectiveness of Vietnam's foreign economic relations.|$|E

40|$|The {{proposed}} system {{illustrates that}} logic fuzzy {{can be used}} to aid management in assessing <b>a</b> <b>supplier's</b> environmental performance in the <b>supplier</b> selection process. <b>A</b> user-centred hierarchical system employing scalable fuzzy membership functions implement human priorities in the supplier selection process, with particular focus on <b>a</b> <b>supplier's</b> environmental performance. Traditionally, when evaluating supplier performance, companies have considered criteria such as price, quality, flexibility, etc. These criteria are of varying importance to individual companies pertaining to their own specific objectives. However, with environmental pressures increasing, many companies have begun to give more attention to environmental issues and, in particular, to their suppliers??? environmental performance. The framework presented here was developed to introduce efficiently environmental criteria into the existing supplier selection process and to reflect on its relevant importance to individual companies. The system presented attempts to simulate the human preference given to particular supplier selection criteria with particular focus on environmental issues when considering supplier selection. The system considers environmental data from multiple aspects of <b>a</b> <b>suppliers</b> business, and based on the relevant impact this will have on a Buying Organization, a decision is reached on the suitability of the <b>supplier.</b> This enables <b>a</b> particular <b>supplier's</b> strengths and weaknesses to be considered as well as considering their significance and relevance to the Buying Organizatio...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Evaluate {{the impact}} of a second supply source on price, quality and stock levels at the {{purchasing}} company. Relevance: The supply strategy defines how many <b>suppliers</b> <b>an</b> item should have and where it should be located. If working with <b>a</b> single <b>supplier</b> may bring relational benefits, working with multiple sources may reduce opportunism risks. If <b>a</b> local <b>supplier</b> reaps benefits on account of its proximity, <b>a</b> global <b>supplier</b> may result in lower costs. Methodology: The quasi-experimental method was used to follow-up a purchasing policy change at an auto parts company, which took on a second supply source for low complexity items. The research collected data on costs, quality and stock coverage for 1, 480 items between 2007 and 2012, analysing new supplier’s entrance and location. Results: Introducing <b>a</b> second <b>supplier</b> reduced the price, especially when <b>a</b> new international <b>supplier</b> was introduced.

We also show that <b>a</b> <b>supplier’s</b> unit cost dominates any reliability considerations when determining whether <b>a</b> particular <b>supplier</b> receives <b>an</b> order. A counterintuitive result is that placing a single order with the lowest cost supplier is preferable when demand is highly uncertain.
