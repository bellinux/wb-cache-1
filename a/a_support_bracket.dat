50|$|The slab lifter uses two safety devices. Safety {{chains and}} <b>a</b> <b>support</b> <b>bracket</b> allow safe lifting of large slabs. This lifting {{appliance}} {{also has a}} safety locking device that is engaged when the gripping pads are activated {{by the weight of}} the stone. This prevents any jerking movement from releasing the stone. It is easily disengaged once the slab is secured at its destination.|$|E
50|$|The Sholef's chassis, {{aside from}} a few minor modifications, is {{identical}} {{to that of the}} Merkava Mk.III. The glacis plate is unchanged, except for the addition of <b>a</b> <b>support</b> <b>bracket</b> for the gun tube, which is folded down when not in use. As such, the Sholef and Merkava series share a large percentage of common components. The front-left side of the chassis has a prominent exhaust louver, along with a much smaller port just in front of it; the exact function of this port is uncertain, though the soot seen around it in photos of the Sholef suggests it may be a new or additional exhaust port, or perhaps an outlet for a smoke generator.|$|E
25|$|Drum mounts are fittings, {{normally}} {{attached to}} the drum shell, that enable a drum to be attached to <b>a</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>bracket,</b> stand or rack. Traditionally, smaller tom-tom drums are supported by mounts and known as hanging toms, while snare drums rest on a stand not {{attached to the}} drum, and floor toms and bass drums rest on their own legs.|$|R

50|$|The AKML comes {{equipped}} with a side-rail used to attach a night vision device. The mount comprises a flat plate riveted to the left wall of the receiver housing and <b>a</b> <b>support</b> <b>bracket</b> fixed to the mounting base with screws. To shield the light-sensitive photo detector plate of the night vision sight, the weapon uses a slotted flash suppressor, which replaces the standard recoil compensator. The AKML can also be deployed in the prone position with a detachable barrel-mounted bipod that helps stabilize the weapon and reduces operator fatigue during prolonged periods of observation. The bipod is supplied as an accessory and is carried in a holster attached to the duty belt.|$|E
5000|$|The {{solar array}} of a PV {{system can be}} mounted on rooftops, {{generally}} with a few inches gap and parallel {{to the surface of}} the roof. If the rooftop is horizontal, the array is mounted with each panel aligned at an angle. If the panels are planned to be mounted before the construction of the roof, the roof can be designed accordingly by installing support brackets for the panels before the materials for the roof are installed. The installation of the solar panels can be undertaken by the crew responsible for installing the roof. If the roof is already constructed, it is relatively easy to retrofit panels directly on top of existing roofing structures. For a small minority of roofs (often not built to code) that are designed so that it is capable of bearing only the weight of the roof, installing solar panels demands that the roof structure must be strengthened before-hand. In all cases of retrofits particular consideration to weather sealing is necessary There are many low-weight designs for PV systems that can be used on either sloped or flat roofs (e.g. plastic wedges or the PV-pod), most however, rely on a type of extruded aluminum rails (e.g. Unirac). Recently, tension-based PV racking solutions have been tested successfully that reduce weight and cost. [...] In some cases, converting to composition shingles, the weight of the removed roof materials can compensate the additional weight of the panels structure. The general practice for installation of roof-mounted solar panels include having <b>a</b> <b>support</b> <b>bracket</b> per hundred watts of panels.|$|E
40|$|A {{latching}} mechanism {{in which there}} is linear movement and rotational movement is described. The umbilical doors of the space shuttle orbiter are required to be open during vehicle launch. After the external tank is released, the doors are closed. Presently, the device for maintaining the doors in an open position is mounted on the external tank and therefore has a single mission life. The {{latching mechanism}} of the invention is mounted in the orbiter and therefore is returned and has multimission capability. The latching mechanism is comprised of a pair of concentric nested, cylindrical cams and motors to actuate the cams, and latch pin all contained within a cover mounted on <b>a</b> <b>support</b> <b>bracket</b> carried by the substructure. A shaft having a latch pin is mounted inside the inner cylindrical cam...|$|E

The workpiece support according to the invention {{is characterized by the}} combination of the following features: - each clamping element has <b>a</b> <b>support</b> <b>bracket</b> adjustable in the radial direction and a clamping piece attached to the support bracket, - each support bracket has a horizontal support plate on which the workpiece lies and a vertical support plate which is adjacent to the side edge of the workpiece, - the support bracket lies on the top surface of the workpiece and is clamped {{in the direction of the}} horizontal support plate of the support bracket by a clamping device...|$|E
50|$|The {{object with}} an {{articulated}} locomotive is to distribute traction power over {{a larger number}} of driving wheels with a flexible wheelbase. On the Mallet type, the boiler was fixed to the frame of the rear engine unit, as on a regular steam locomotive. The front engine unit carried the boiler barrel by means of <b>a</b> large <b>supporting</b> <b>bracket,</b> attached to the underside of the barrel and carried on a slide, fixed to the front engine unit's frame. On curves, the front engine unit could move several inches laterally under the boiler barrel. Side control springs acted as a centering device for the engine unit.|$|R

50|$|Windows on {{the front}} of the {{building}} outside the portico are sets of three one-over-one double-hung windows on each floor. The second floor windows each have decorative sills, and relief panels sit below. Windows on the east and west sides of the building, including the wing additions, have only two windows per set. Entries are finished similarly to the front, Corinthian pilasters <b>supporting</b> <b>a</b> <b>bracketed</b> cornice.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{is an example}} of Neo-Classical Revival architecture. The three-story brick-clad structure rests on a brick base. The first level features rows of recessed bricks which lend a rusticated look to the building at this level. A molded limestone belt course atop the rustication separates the first floor from the second. There is also an unenriched limestone beltcourse above the third floor windows. <b>A</b> denticulated entablature <b>supports</b> <b>a</b> <b>bracketed</b> cornice.

40|$|A load {{regulating}} mechanical latch {{is described}} {{that has a}} pivotally mounted latch element having a hook-shaped end with a strike roller-engaging laterally open hook for engaging a stationary strike roller. The latch element or hook is pivotally mounted in a clevis end of an elongated latch stem that is adapted for axial movement through an opening in <b>a</b> <b>support</b> plate or <b>bracket</b> mounted to a structural member. A coil spring is disposed over and around the extending latch stem and {{the lower end of}} the coil spring engages the <b>support</b> <b>bracket.</b> <b>A</b> thrust washer is removably attached to the other end of the latch stem and engages the other end of the coil spring and compresses the coil spring thereby preloading the spring and the latch element carried by the latch stem. The hook-shaped latch element has a limited degree of axial travel for loading caused by structural distortion which may change the relative positions of the latch element hook and the strike roller. Means are also provided to permit limited tilt of the latch element due to loading of the hook...|$|R
