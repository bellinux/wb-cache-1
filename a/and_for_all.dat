5|$|Hoping to {{establish}} his credentials once <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> as an expert field naturalist, Ernest Thompson Seton spent several years of the controversy working diligently on his two-volume work Life-Histories of Northern Animals, {{which was published in}} 1909. After an enlarged edition of the book was published as Lives of Game Animals, Seton was ironically awarded the Burroughs Medal in 1927, a prize named after the venerable naturalist who had once so criticized Seton's work.|$|E

5|$|A {{few years}} before Leo's paper, the first small papyrus {{fragment}} was found, and {{the first half of}} the twentieth century would see the publication of several other pieces which added significantly to the modern text of the Catalogue. Among these finds were important passages, the Catalogue of Suitors and Epithalamium of Peleus and Thetis for example, but few advanced the modern understanding of the work's overall structure. The appearance of the proem in 1956 actually led to a major misapprehension, for the list of gods found therein, beginning with Zeus and proceeding through the divine Heracles, led some to believe that the Catalogue was not organized in a strictly genealogical manner, but presented the unions of gods and heroines organized to some extent by amorous deity. Six years later, with the publication of the 28th part of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, the corpus of papyrus witnesses to the fragmentary Hesiodic poems was nearly doubled, with the lion's share of these new texts belonging to the Catalogue. The new papyri proved once <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> that the poem was organized by genealogies of the great families in a way similar to the Bibliotheca, and that the poet's use of the ē' hoiē-formula was not a random method of introduction but an organizing tool within an overall structure.|$|E

In the end, the boy enters the evil Queen's castle to find and defeat her once <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>all.</b> Once she is no more, he gets instantly transported back to the baseball field where it all had started.|$|E

Smith accepted an invitation from the BBC to appear on its Twenty-Four Hours evening news and current affairs programme, but Downing Street blocked this at the last minute. Following largely abortive talks with Wilson, the Rhodesian Prime Minister flew home on 12 October. Desperate to avert UDI, Wilson travelled to Salisbury two weeks later to continue negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Aria of Sorrow {{takes place}} in the fictional {{universe}} of the Castlevania series.

Shortly after Dracula's death, a prophecy was made that Dracula's reincarnation would come to his castle in 2035 and inherit all of Dracula's powers. This prophecy acts as {{the driving force behind the}} plot of Aria of Sorrow, and is the primary motivation of the supporting characters to be present. The game {{takes place in}} Dracula's castle, the most common setting for the series, with the castle divided into numerous areas that the player traverses over the course of the game.|$|E

In the early 1990s, shortly after moving to Greece, Tsakalotos became a member of Synaspismos, a radical left-wing {{political}} party, which was to become the largest constituent party of Syriza. Syriza itself was formed in 2004, ahead of that year's legislative election, as a coalition of 13 left-wing political parties in Greece. Tsakalotos was elected to their Central Committee in December 2004. However, he also remained a prominent member of Synaspismos and served on both their Central Political Committee and their Political Secretariat until a July 2013 party congress, during which Syriza voted to become an independent political party <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> component parties to disband, including Synaspismos.|$|E

5|$|Between 1158–1162, {{a series}} of Byzantine campaigns against the Seljuk Turks of the Sultanate of Rûm {{resulted}} in a treaty favourable to the Empire. According to the agreement, certain frontier regions, including the city of Sivas, should be handed over to Manuel in return for some quantity of cash, while it also obliged the Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan II to recognize his overlordship. Kilij Arslan II used the peace with Byzantium, and the power vacuum caused by the death in 1174 of Nur ad-Din Zangi the ruler of Syria, to expel the Danishmends from their Anatolian emirates. When the Seljuk sultan refused to cede some of the territory he had taken from the Danishmends to the Byzantines, as he was obliged to do {{as part of his}} treaty obligations, Manuel decided {{that it was time to}} deal with the Turks once <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>all.</b> Therefore, he assembled the full imperial army and marched against the Seljuk capital, Iconium (Konya).
