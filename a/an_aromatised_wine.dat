50|$|Lillet (French pronunciation: li'le), classed as <b>an</b> <b>aromatised</b> <b>wine</b> within EU law, is a French wine-based {{aperitif}} from Podensac. It is {{a blend of}} 85% Bordeaux region wines (Semillon for the Blanc and for the Rosé, Merlot for the Rouge) and 15% macerated liqueurs, mostly citrus liqueurs (peels of sweet oranges from Spain and Morocco and peels of bitter green oranges from Haiti). The mix is then stirred in oak vats until blended. During the aging process, Lillet is handled as a Bordeaux wine (undergoing fining, racking, filtering etc.).|$|E
50|$|Fortified wine is a wine {{to which}} a {{distilled}} spirit, usually brandy, is added. Many different styles of fortified wine have been developed, including Port, Sherry, Madeira, Marsala, Commandaria <b>wine</b> and the <b>aromatised</b> <b>wine</b> Vermouth.|$|R
50|$|Americano uses {{gentian root}} {{as the main}} {{flavouring}} ingredient. The name comes from the Italian 'Amer' meaning bitter, rather than any reference to 'America'. Brands {{of this type of}} <b>aromatised</b> <b>wine</b> aperitif include Cocchi Americano and Vergano Americano.|$|R
5000|$|... "Sengri", {{which is}} a kind of hot punch with <b>aromatised</b> <b>wine,</b> dating {{from the time of the}} British {{presence}} in the eighteenth century. In spite of the similarity of the word, it has nothing to do with the sangria.|$|R
2500|$|The Regulation {{laying down}} general rules on the definition, {{description}} and presentation of <b>aromatised</b> <b>wines,</b> <b>aromatised</b> wine-based drinks and aromatised wine-product cocktails (No1601/91) institutes {{a system of}} protected denominations for aromatised drinks which {{is very similar to}} that for spirits. The association of general names with specific countries is weaker: a drink labelled simply [...] "Sangria" [...] must have been produced in Spain or Portugal, for example, but it is permissible to label a drink [...] "Sangria produced in the United Kingdom: aromatised wine-based drink" [...] if the drink meets the other requirements to be described as sangria. Similarly, the denomination [...] "Clarea" [...] on its own is reserved for drinks produced in Spain. The protected geographical designations are: ...|$|R
50|$|Vermouth is {{the most}} widely used <b>aromatised</b> <b>wine</b> due to its use in cocktails and famous {{commercial}} brands such as Martini and Cinzano which are commonplace around the world. Vermouth can be sweet or dry and red, white, pink or orange. It is traditionally flavoured with an infusion of herbs, peels and spices, including wormwood but modern commercial brands are likely to be made with a sweet concentrate of flavours to maintain consistency and low-cost. Other brands include Punt e Mes, Noilly Prat and Carpano.|$|R
5000|$|... "Orelletes", {{which are}} {{pronounced}} [...] "oran" [...] in Minorca, are fried dough. They are thin, irregular and crisp, <b>aromatised</b> with muscat <b>wine</b> {{and served with}} warm honey.|$|R
5000|$|Byrrh is <b>an</b> <b>aromatised</b> wine-based apéritif made of red wine, mistelle, and quinine. Created in 1866 and a {{trademark}} since 1873, it was popular as a French apéritif. With its marketing and {{reputation as a}} [...] "hygienic drink", Byrrh sold well in the early 20th century. It was even exported, despite the similarity of its name to [...] "beer", complicating sales in English- and German-language speaking regions.|$|R
40|$|Covalent functionalisation of {{collagen}} {{has been}} shown to be a promising strategy to adjust the mechanical properties of highly swollen collagen hydrogels. At the same time, secondary interactions between for example, amino acidic terminations or introduced functional groups also play an important role and are often challenging to predict and control. To explore this challenge, 4 -vinylbenzyl chloride (4 VBC) and methacrylic anhydride (MA) were reacted with type I collagen, and the swelling and rheological properties of resulting photo activated hydrogel systems investigated. 4 VBC-based hydrogels showed significantly increased swelling ratio, in light of the lower degree of collagen functionalisation, with respect to methacrylated collagen networks, whilst rheological storage moduli were found to be comparable between the two systems. To explore the role of benzyl groups in the mechanical properties of the 4 VBC-based collagen system, model chemical force microscopy (CFM) was carried out in aqueous environment with <b>an</b> <b>aromatised</b> probe against <b>an</b> <b>aromatised</b> gold coated glass slide. A marked increase in adhesion force (F: 0. 11 +/- 0. 01 nN) was measured between aromatised samples, compared to the adhesion force observed between the non-modified probe and a glass substrate (F: 2. 64 +/- 1. 82 nN). These results suggest the formation of additional and reversible π-π stacking interactions in aromatic 4 VBC-based networks and explain the remarkable rheological properties of this system in comparison to MA based hydrogels.

50|$|Vino de naranja or 'orange wine' is {{produced}} in Huelva and Málaga in Andalucia, Spain with white wine macerated with orange peel. Vino Naranja del Condado de Huelva is an appellation of origin for <b>aromatised</b> sweet <b>wines</b> originating in Condado de Huelva, Spain. The system of production and aging of this wine is a white wine flavoured with macerated orange peel followed by a process of aging by the solera system. Orange Wine from Huelva is usually dark orange to brown in color. The brown color {{is a result of}} sun drying of the grapes prior to fermentation.|$|R

The company says it is the [...] "number-one selling aperitif brand in the United States". The beverage is famous in the UK for having been the favourite drink of the Queen Mother.|$|R
40|$|Msayer is a dry salted lemon used as <b>an</b> <b>aromatising</b> {{condiment}} in many North-African food recipes. This {{preparation is}} obtained by adding coarse salt (10 g/ 100 g fresh lemons) to fresh cut lemons in containers kept under dark conditions away from air for around {{a month and}} a half A survey of 52 days showed low initial uptake of citric acid and sugars from the formed liquid phase. Nevertheless, there were still sugars detected even at the end of the survey attesting for the low microbial activity as also shown by carbon dioxide production and microbial viable counts. Indeed, the microbial counts showed a steady decrease reaching 2 log units at the 52 nd day of curing. Moulds were detected only at the beginning but at low numbers. No viable counts of lactic acid bacteria were observed on MRS medium despite detection of lactic acid (8 g/l). In contrast, yeasts seem to dominate in the msayer preparation. They count for almost all the microbial population especially after the first week. Six of these acid and halotolerant yeast isolates were identified, by sequence analysis of the amplified 5. 8 S rRNA and the two internal transcribed spacer regions, as Candida parapsislosis (2 isolates) and unclassified Saccharomycetales (4 isolates).

50|$|The lardo, one of {{a number}} of {{preserved}} meat specialties of the region, is produced by curing pieces of fatback in <b>a</b> brine <b>aromatised</b> with such herbs and spices as juniper, bay, nutmeg, sage and rosemary. The brining takes place in wooden tubs known as doïls, which may be made of chestnut, oak or larch, and are used solely for this purpose; it is known that Lard d’Arnad has been made for more than two centuries since a 1763 inventory from Arnad Castle refers to four doïls which belonged to its kitchens. It is often eaten with black bread and honey.|$|R
40|$|International audiencePenicillium glabrum is an {{ubiquitous}} fungus distributed world wide. This fungus is {{a frequent}} contaminant in the food manufacturing industry. Environmental factors such as temperature, water activity and pH have a great influence on fungal development. In this study, a strain of P. glabrum referenced to as LCP 08. 5568, has been isolated from <b>a</b> bottle of <b>aromatised</b> mineral water. The effects of temperature, aw and pH on radial growth rate were assessed on Czapeck Yeast Agar (CYA) medium. Models derived from the cardinal model with inflection (Rosso et al., 1993 An unexpected correlation between cardinal temperatures of microbial growth highlighted by a new model. J Theor. Bio. 162, 447 - 463) were used to fit the experimental data and determine for each factor, the cardinal parameters (minimum, optimum and maximum). Precise characterisation of the growth conditions for such a fungal contaminant, has an evident interest to understand and to prevent spoilage of food products...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the synthesis and intramolecular cycloaddition products of azides tethered to olefins bearing a heteroatom {{in an attempt}} to access a proposed triazolium intermediate 77. Chapter 1 covers the synthesis and reactivity of simple di- and trisubstituted azidoalkyl enol ethers. These substrates were found to provide isolable 1, 2, 3 -triazoline products, but displayed <b>a</b> propensity to <b>aromatise</b> to 1, 2, 3 -triazoles upon ionisation. Difficulties in synthesising fully-substituted azidoalkyl enol ethers have precluded a detailed study in this project, though a bias towards α-alkoxy imine formation was suggested. Chapter 2 covers the chemistry of azidoalkyl vinyl bromides. Simple vinyl bromide substrates were found to yield 1 -azadienes upon thermolysis, presumably via the dehydrobromination of an α-bromo imine intermediate in situ. In Chapter 3, a brief diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) campaign was undertaken to demonstrate the potent reactivity of 1 -azadiene substrates. 1 -Azadienes were found to be versatile intermediates, and a small DOS library was built by exploiting several key reactivity modes. In Chapter 4, two miscellaneous routes towards the desired triazolium intermediate are discussed, and finally an Appendix chapter deals with an attempted total synthesis of salinosporamide C.
