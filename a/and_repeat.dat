40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that the use of modelling and non-food rewards may be effective at increasing tasting, and consequential liking and acceptance, of a previously disliked food. Although successful school-based interventions have been developed, {{there is a lack of}} research into home-based interventions using these methods. This study aimed to develop and investigate the efficacy of a parent led home-based intervention for increasing children's acceptance of a disliked vegetable. A total of 115 children aged 2 - 4 years were allocated to one of four intervention groups or to a no-treatment control. The four intervention conditions were: <b>repeated</b> exposure; modelling <b>and</b> <b>repeated</b> exposure; rewards <b>and</b> <b>repeated</b> exposure; or modelling, rewards <b>and</b> <b>repeated</b> exposure. Children in all of the intervention conditions were exposed by a parent to daily offerings of a disliked vegetable for 14 days. Liking and consumption of the vegetable were measured pre and post-intervention. Significant increases in post-intervention consumption were seen in the modelling, rewards <b>and</b> <b>repeated</b> exposure condition <b>and</b> the rewards <b>and</b> <b>repeated</b> exposure condition, compared to the control group. Significant post-intervention differences in liking were also found between the experimental groups. Liking was highest (> 60 %) in the modelling, rewards <b>and</b> <b>repeated</b> exposure group <b>and</b> the rewards <b>and</b> <b>repeated</b> exposure group, intermediate (> 26 %) in the modelling <b>and</b> <b>repeated</b> exposure <b>and</b> <b>repeated</b> exposure groups, <b>and</b> lowest in the control group (10 %). Parent led interventions based around modelling and offering incentives may present cost efficient ways to increase children's vegetable consumption...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} {{highlights the}} importance of social norms in many economic relations. However, many of these relationships are long-term <b>and</b> provide <b>repeated</b> game incentives for performance. We experimentally investigate interaction effects of reciprocity <b>and</b> <b>repeated</b> game incentives in two treatments (one-shot <b>and</b> <b>repeated)</b> of a gift-exchange game. In both treatments we observe reciprocity, which is strengthened in the repeated game. A detailed analysis shows that in the repeated game some subjects imitate reciprocity. Thus, reciprocity <b>and</b> <b>repeated</b> game incentives reinforce each other. Observed behaviour is robust against experience. We conclude that a long-term interaction is a &# 147;reciprocity-compatible&# 148; contract enforcement device. ...|$|R

5|$|Arkham Asylums boss fights were criticized, {{with many}} reviewers {{labeling}} {{them as the}} game's biggest failing. Reviewers found that the battles often rely on old-fashioned, tedious, and repetitive game tropes that required the player to learn <b>and</b> <b>repeat</b> monotonous routinessome of which, {{in the case of}} Bane, had already been employed on lesser enemiesor to confront repetitive attack patterns and one-hit deaths. Reviewers generally agreed that the fights were anti-climactic to their build-up spectacle. The final boss fight with the Joker was singled out for vapid gameplay, a battle with Killer Croc was labeled boring and overly long, and the reviewers said these should not have been in the game. However, the fear toxin-induced hallucination segments of Scarecrow's battles were almost unanimously praised as some of the game's best and most cerebral moments for their fourth wall manipulation, subversion of the game's established narrative and expectations, and meta-textual influences that were compared to the battle against Psycho Mantis in 1998's Metal Gear Solid, and 2002's Eternal Darkness.|$|E

5|$|Aware of the {{critical}} buzz surrounding the show, BBC1 Controller, Michael Grade, quickly announced that the series would be repeated on BBC1, stating, “I think it will reach a wider audience and it deserves it”, and so Edge of Darkness was duly shown, in double episodes, over three consecutive nights between 19 December and 21 December 1985, the fastest time between original broadcast <b>and</b> <b>repeat</b> in the BBC's history. These repeats were accompanied by a disclaimer that the GAIA organisation depicted in the programme was not connected with the Gaia publishing company supported by Prince Philip.

5|$|Bird {{collections}} {{are used for}} a wide variety of purposes. All biological species including those of birds are represented by a holotype, the vast majority of which are full specimens (mostly skins) and in modern times explicitly designated in the original description of the taxon. All other putative members of the species may be compared to the holotype to confirm their identification. Rigorous studies of avian taxonomy are based on specimens from bird collections. Taxonomic studies rely on morphological and genetic characters to determine species limits and evolutionary relationships. Museum specimens have been the preferred source for scoring these s, as they allow studies to be replicated – anyone may go back <b>and</b> <b>repeat</b> the study using the same specimens to verify the conclusions. However, it has alternatively been argued that such re-examination can be undertaken from archived photographs without killing the study piece.|$|E
5|$|Female {{and male}} flowers in each syconium mature at {{different}} times. Female wasps enter the syconium and lay {{eggs in the}} female flowers as they mature. These eggs later hatch and the progeny mate. The females of the new generation collect pollen from the male flowers, which have matured by this point, and leave to visit other syconia <b>and</b> <b>repeat</b> the process. A field study in Brisbane found that F. obliqua trees often bore {{both male and female}} syconia at the same time—this could be beneficial for reproduction in isolated populations, such as those on islands. The same study found a slightly reduced number of male phase syconia in winter, thought due to increased mortality of the wasp pollinator in cooler months.|$|E

5|$|Rhythm game, or rhythm action, is a subgenre {{of action}} game that {{challenges}} a player's sense of rhythm. The genre includes dance games such as Dance Dance Revolution and music-based games such as Donkey Konga and Guitar Hero. Games in the genre challenge the player to press buttons at precise times: the screen shows which button the player {{is required to}} press, and the game awards points both for accuracy and for synchronization with the beat. The genre also includes games that measure rhythm and pitch, {{in order to test}} a player's singing ability, and games that challenge the player to control their volume by measuring how hard they press each button. While songs can be sight read, players usually practice to master more difficult songs and settings. Certain rhythm games offer a challenge similar to that of Simon says, in that the player must watch, remember, <b>and</b> <b>repeat</b> complex sequences of button-presses. Rhythm-action can take a minigame format with some games blending rhythm with other genres or entirely comprising minigame collections.|$|E
5|$|The Interstate Highways and U.S. Routes in Delaware are {{numbered}} {{according to a}} national numbering pattern.

5|$|The festivals {{associated}} with Vithoba primarily {{correspond to the}} bi-annual yatras (pilgrimages) of the Varkaris.

5|$|Over Romney Marsh Nos. 41, 92 and 222 Squadrons engaged JG 26, {{losing one}} of their number to the Bf 109s.
