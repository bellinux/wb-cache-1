5|$|The final {{was played}} at the Estadio Centenario on 30 July. Feelings ran high around the La Plata Basin as the Argentine {{supporters}} crossed the river with the war cry Victoria o muerte ("victory or death"), dispelling any uncertainty {{as to whether the}} tournament had captured the imagination of the public. The ten boats earmarked to carry Argentine fans from Buenos Aires to Montevideo proved inadequate, <b>and</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> assorted craft attempted the crossing. An estimated 10–15,000 Argentinians made the trip, but the port at Montevideo was so overwhelmed that many did not even make landfall before kick-off, let alone reach the stadium. At the stadium, supporters were searched for weapons. The gates were opened at eight o'clock, six hours before kick-off, and at noon the ground was full, the official attendance 93,000. A disagreement overshadowed the build-up to the match as the teams failed to agree on who should provide the match ball, forcing FIFA to intervene and decree that the Argentine team would provide the ball for the first half and the Uruguayans would provide their own for the second. Uruguay made one change from their semi-final line-up. Castro replaced Anselmo, who missed out due to illness. Monti played for Argentina despite receiving death threats {{on the eve of the}} match. The referee was Belgian John Langenus, who only agreed to officiate a few hours before the game, having sought assurances for his safety. One of his requests was for a boat to be ready at the harbour within one hour of the final whistle, in case he needed to make a quick escape.|$|E

Again, the exergy of a system {{is determined by the}} potential of that system to do work, so it is necessary to determine the baseline qualities of a system before it is possible to understand the potential of that system. The thermodynamic value of a resource can be found by multiplying the exergy of the resource by the cost of obtaining the resource and processing it.|$|E
25|$|The company's new cahier des charges (license) was liberal. It {{called for}} new French operas with spoken {{dialogue}} (opéra comique) or sung recitative, prose or verse librettos, and {{with or without}} ballets. No single composer could have more than six new acts presented in one season (acts were counted rather than works). Preference was {{to be given to}} Prix de Rome winners up to two years after the award. In addition, up to two translated foreign works were permitted, as well as French works ten years after their premiere, <b>and</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> public domain works, so long as these did not exceed 33% of the number of new acts presented over a two-year period. The company had the right to revive any works it had already produced, to encourage the company to establish its own repertory. As the company did not receive any state subsidy before 1864, revivals of popular, established works were critical to its financial survival.|$|E

25|$|After the serve, {{the players}} take turns {{hitting the ball}} against the front wall, above the tin and below the out line. The ball may strike the side or back walls at any time, {{as long as it}} hits below the out line. It must not hit the floor after hitting the racket and before hitting the front wall. A ball landing on either the out line or the line {{along the top of the}} tin is {{considered}} to be out. After the ball hits the front wall, it is allowed to bounce once on the floor (<b>and</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> times against the side or back walls) before a player must return it. Players may move anywhere around the court but accidental or deliberate obstruction of the other player's movements is forbidden and could result in a let or a stroke. Players typically return to the centre of the court after making a shot.|$|E
500|$|Pain in My Heart {{received}} positive critical reception. Bruce Eder of Allmusic {{gave the}} album 4 out of 5 stars, reckoning that the album [...] "was practically {{a road map}} to Mick Jagger <b>and</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> other would-be white soul shouters in the UK", and finding elements of hard rock in [...] "Hey Hey Baby". He praised Redding's version of [...] "You Send Me", considering it [...] "the least stylized of any of his renditions of [...] Cooke's songs", but criticized Redding's restraint, compared to future recordings, and the [...] "somewhat less than memorable" [...] writing, except on [...] "Security", [...] "These Arms of Mine" [...] and [...] "That's What My Heart Needs".

2500|$|Not {{all of the}} reputed holy thorns are {{first-class}} relics, that is, {{relics of}} the original crown. M. de Mély was able to enumerate more than 700. The statement in one medieval obituary that Peter de Averio gave to the cathedral of Angers, [...] "unam de spinis quae fuit apposita coronae spinae nostri Redemptoris" [...] ("one of the spines which were attached to the thorny crown of our Redeemer") (de Mély, p.362) indicates {{that many of the}} thorns were relics of the third class—objects touched to a relic of the first class, in this case some part of the crown itself. (In Roman Catholic tradition, a relic of the first class {{is a part of the}} body of a saint or, in this case, any of the objects used in the Crucifixion that carried the blood of Christ; a relic of the second class is anything known to have been touched or used by a saint; a relic of the third class is a devotional object touched to a first-class relic and, usually, formally blessed as a sacramental.) Again, even in comparatively modern times, it is not always easy to trace the history of these objects of devotion, as first-class relics were often divided <b>and</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> authentic third-class relics may exist.|$|E
