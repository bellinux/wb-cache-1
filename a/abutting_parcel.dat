The consequence of such adverse possession on part only of a parcel is that the location of the boundary demarcating the limits of the respective domains of two adjoining land parcels may be displaced. If part parcel adverse possession effectively transfers ownership of a small portion of an <b>abutting</b> <b>parcel,</b> the boundaries are shifted consequent to long term occupation, and will prevail over the strict technical legal boundary. In a registered title land system the occupational boundary then prevails over the legal boundary as certified in the register notwithstanding that registered title schemes purport to confer conclusiveness upon register entries. Alternatively, the registered proprietor’s estate is not paramount where any part of the proprietor's parcel has been adversely occupied. Consequently the occupier has an interest in the proprietor's land that is not disclosed in the register. Inspection of the register and reliance upon the inspection is insufficient to ascertain the complete legal status of the particular land holding. Inspection with consequent reliance upon the register is the major function of a registered title scheme. Alternatively, if part parcel adverse possession is ineffective to transfer ownership of registered land, the technical legal boundary prevails over the occupational boundary despite the fact that it is not the boundary accepted by the parties involved as governing. Both alternatives present a problem to the orderly conduct of the land market. Where occupations prevail, the prudent market participant takes precautions besides relying on inspection of the register. Where the legal boundary prevails, the participant seeks confirmation that the occupational and legal boundaries coincide. Another alternative utilised in some registered title jurisdictions empowers a court to transfer small sections to an adjoining landholder where a building or similar improvement is erected so that it encroaches upon the adjacent holding. This alternative was included within the ambit of the thesis as it developed. The aim of this research was the formulation of the best solution suitable for a registered land system with particular reference towards a uniform solution suitable for adoption in all Australian jurisdictions. The existing systems utilising adverse possession and statutory encroachment were evaluated against three recent law cases that illustrate the workings of these systems including perceived shortcomings. These lawsuits serve as a test against which the existing systems are compared and evaluated and were also used to evaluate the proposed solution. The results suggest that adverse possession alone should not override the purpose of the register which is to fully disclose the proprietary interests in land parcels. It was concluded that a necessary step in acquiring title to land through adverse possession involves the registration of the interest acquired. Whereas the present modes of dealing with the boundary problem are adequate, it is concluded that the best mode is that of statutory encroachment because it best serves several competing interests. Adopting the proposed solution would involve change and compromise in some of the Australian jurisdictions; these being necessary to adopt a uniform scheme throughout Australia. The proposed solution has added benefits of removing an illogicality from some of the present systems, eliminating encouragement for an off-register land market, and fosters an accurate public land register.

The initial donation included 86 acres, but the couple subsequently purchased and donated additional parcels to create the 212-acre park that exists today. Coggshall Park also <b>abuts</b> a large <b>parcel</b> of conservation land and a bird sanctuary, providing a total of approximately 300 acres for visitors to enjoy.|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} characteristic of real property law, {{one that is}} definitional in nature, is that its subject matter consists of land parcels. A land parcel, in contrast to an ownership interest such as a fee simple estate, is not an abstraction. Each land parcel has a physical reality, and virtually all land <b>parcels</b> <b>abut</b> other <b>parcels.</b> Each parcel has one particular location, defined by its proximity to other pieces of property. The value of a land parcel depends heavily upon its location, {{and the nature of}} neighboring parcels has a major impact in determining that value. Owners of neighboring parcels have sets of rights, privileges, and duties that define their legal relationships with neighbors. In Anglo-American law, those rights, privileges, and duties are components of real property law, but they are not a recognized category of real property law. Rather, they represent the application of general doctrines and rules to neighbors, instead of a distinct and cohesive body of law of its own. Other legal systems have developed distinct bodies of law to govern relations among neighbors. The law of neighbors or “neighborhood law” is not presently a recognized type of law practice in the United States, and it will not likely become one anytime in the near future. In part this is the case because neighbor law disputes typically do not involve high financial stakes and resulting incentives for lawyers to market themselves as experts in the area. This Article suggests that if the field of neighbor law develops in the United States, academics will have to lead the way. This Article does three things. First, it introduces the “stranger model” and the “friend model” of neighbors law, using these models as a frame for describing three components of existing U. S. law applicable to neighboring landowners. Second, it briefly describes the extent to which South Africa and Scotland have come to describe neighbors law as a discrete legal category, which correlates to the stranger model and friend model. Third, it concludes by making several suggestions on how the models may help in the construction of a coherent law of neighbors...|$|R
50|$|At {{the northwestern}} {{corner of the}} {{property}} stands a 1-1/2 story Cape style house, presumed to have been built by Clark Watkins not long after he purchased the land (a <b>parcel</b> <b>abutting</b> Hill's) in 1837. Watkins's widow Mary acquired the Hill farm in 1876, and moved into its larger house, renting the Cape to tenants. In 1877 Sumner Watkins, the son of Mary and Clark, established a carriage factory on the Hill property, at a site across Raymond Neck Road from the main house. This {{marked the beginning of}} a shift away from agricultural uses of the property, although the Watkinses did continue to produce dairy products and apples into the 20th century. The carriage factory operated until 1907, and the building was torn down in the 1930s.|$|R

In the spring of 1995 an 11-acre (4.5 ha) <b>parcel</b> <b>abutting</b> the property on the north was slated for higher density rezoning and offered for sale. With the help of longtime member John Maher, Tohono Chul was able to acquire the property, establishing a memorial to John’s late wife, Mary. The most recent addition came when the much-loved Haunted Bookshop closed in 1997. The Wilsons donated the land and building, thus adding the final acre — then there were 49 (19.8 ha)! ...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} a plan to {{transform}} an under-utilized parcel of public land into a community asset. Through the analysis of construction, funding, site constraints, maintenance and stewardship options, the project team created a design concept and implementation plan for a parcel of land adjacent to the Interstate 5 freeway. The project team solicited input from community residents through a public involvement process and created an advisory committee consisting of stakeholders to provide guidance for the project. The plan documents the process of project initiation and the selection of alternatives. This plan {{may be used as}} a reference for enhancing publicly owned parcels in other neighborhoods. The site is an unimproved 1. 5 -acre <b>parcel</b> <b>abutting</b> a raised portion of I- 5 situated {{on the west side of}} N. Mississippi Avenue between N. Monroe Street to the north and N. Stanton Street to the south. (See Figure 6) The Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) owns the parcel Initial inquiries by the project team indicated that the Oregon Department of Transportation would be willing to allow improvements to the landscape on this parcel. After making preliminary contacts with the Boise neighborhood, the Albina Youth Opportunity School (A YOS) and the Mississippi Historic District Target Area (Mississippi Target Area), the project team, looking south found that the creation of a neighborhood gateway met the needs of the area. For this reason the Mississippi Target Area, which is involved in numerous neighborhood revitalization projects, was chosen as an appropriate client for the project. Working with the concept of a neighborhood gateway, the project team conducted two public workshops to gather input from the neighborhood regarding the use and design of the site. Representatives from the Oregon Department of Transportation, City of Portland Environmental Services, Albina Youth Opportunity School (A YOS), the Mississippi Target Area, the Portland Development Commission, and neighborhood representatives served on an advisory committee that reviewed design suggestions from the community. This project was conducted under the supervision of Deborah Howe, Tom Sanchez, and Connie Ozawa...|$|R
