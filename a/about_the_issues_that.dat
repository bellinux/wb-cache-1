She found very little, and much of what she found described homosexuals as [...] "deviants", [...] "perverts", and [...] "abnormal" [...] in medical books and texts on abnormal psychology, or odd generalizations that stated homosexuals were unable to whistle, or that their favorite color was green. She found all the information focused on homosexual men. [...] She recalled in a 2001 interview, [...] "I thought, this is not about me. There is nothing here about love or happiness. There has to be something better". Her research took up so much of her time at Northwestern that she ended up failing out of the school. Gittings found a purpose during this time, saying, [...] "My mission was not to get a general education but to find out about myself and what my life would be like. So I stopped going to classes and started going to the library. There were no organizations to turn to in those days only libraries were safe, although the information contained was dismal." ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{estimated}} 52.4 {{million people}} watched the debate. [...] A CBS poll conducted after {{the debate on}} independent voters found that 38% {{felt it was a}} draw, 40% felt Obama had won, and 22% thought that McCain had won. Voters and analysts agreed that Obama had won on the economy, but that McCain had done better on foreign policy issues, which were the focus of the debate. However, Obama had a more substantial lead on the economy than McCain did on foreign policy. Initial CNN polling reported Obama won the debate overall by a margin of 51–38. A CBS poll of uncommitted voters shows Obama winning 39–24, with 37% of voters undecided. Times Mark Halperin graded Obama's performance an A- and McCain's performance a B-. One analyst, Nate Silver, gave greater emphasis to the fact that Obama spoke more effectively <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> mattered most to the voters, an interpretation that was backed up by Time Magazine commentator Joe Klein.|$|E

Harding's veto of the popular measure particularly alienated the Senate Republicans, who thought the President's defense of fiscal integrity endangered the party's electoral prospects.|$|R

30|$|The {{previous}} section talked <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> {{was introduced in}} this paper, specifically the utilisation of resampling in various memory computing devices. In this current section, {{the solution to this}} issue will be outlined. Therefore, the aim {{of this paper is to}} outline a new and credible method to conduct single distribution resampling, which is called the adaptive memory size based resampling. This new method is based on the integration of traditional variation resampling and traditional resampling in a resampling architecture. The algorithm is capable of switching the resampling algorithm based on computing device’s memory. Applying this algorithm can help the developer develop a particle filter more easily without having to immediately consider a computing device’s memory utilisation when different particle filter development processes are involved. The next section will talk <b>about</b> <b>the</b> design of the proposed algorithm that was presented in this paper.|$|R
50|$|English philosopher, statesman, {{and author}} Francis Bacon (1561-1626) wrote an essay {{entitled}} Of Suspicion, {{in which he}} stated that suspicions need to be repressed and well-guarded, because otherwise they will cloud the mind, and cause a ruler to move towards tyranny, due to the fear that his subjects are conspiring against him, and a husband to become jealous and fearful of his wife's interactions with other men. Bacon argued that the root of suspicion {{was a lack of}} knowledge; as such, the remedy to suspicion was to learn more <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> is troubling you. If a husband is concerned about his wife's male friends, he should ask her <b>about</b> <b>the</b> nature of these friendships, and state his concerns, rather than building up his suspicions. Bacon urged people who were harbouring suspicions to be frank with the people that they were suspecting, and clear the matter up.|$|R

40|$|Many {{contributions}} in the recent literature have investigated over the relationship between GDP growth and its volatility without getting a clear and unambiguous answer. Besides reassessing the well-known effect of output volatility on growth as benchmark analysis, this study aims at looking into the “black box” of the business cycle volatility by disentangling the impacts of volatility of GDP major components—that is, private consumption, private investment and government expenditure—on growth, simultaneously considered. Our empirical analysis unveils a remarkably robust and strong negative correlation of consumption volatility with mean growth and a positive one with volatility of investment and of public expenditure. If these findings shed some additional light on the (still controversial) relationship between economic fluctuations and growth, they will also {{make it possible to}} compare the relative impact of each component, with possibly relevant policy implications. Importantly, this might reconcile opposite views <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> different empirical results might originate from the relative importance across empirical studies of the various components of volatility...|$|R
