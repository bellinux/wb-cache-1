The biomarkers employed in the investigation of previous infection include total IgG and <b>IgM</b> <b>anti-HAV</b> antibodies, and for the detection of more recent infection, <b>IgM</b> <b>anti-HAV</b> antibodies were analyzed. The study was performed in 1991 and 1992. According to the results, 69. 7 % of the children presented total IgG/IgM anti-HAV antibodies, with 60 % of the group in the age range of 1 to 3 years. Among 10 day-care centers analyzed, the prevalence of the biomarker <b>IgM</b> <b>anti-HAV</b> was 3. 2 %, with an uniform distribution of the cases in the group of children ranging in age from 1 to 4 years. Multi-variate analysis was performed to investigate the sociodemographic factors that could influence the results.

Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study of 2 -years duration was conducted in the Department of Microbiology, KMC, Mangalore. A non-random sampling of 958 patients presenting with AVH was considered in the study. On the basis of history, serum samples were analysed for <b>IgM</b> <b>anti-HAV</b> and <b>IgM</b> anti-HEV {{for the detection of}} HAV and HEV, respectively using commercially available ELISA kits. Data collected was analysed by using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 11. 5. Results: The seroprevalence of HAV- and HEV-positive patients were 19. 31 % and 10. 54 %, respectively. The seroprevalence of both HAV and HEV in patients with acute viral hepatitis was 11. 5 %. The prevalence of HAV and HEV among males (68 % and 31 %) was higher than in females (31 % and 20 %) and was predominantly seen among young adults. These infections were predominantly seen during end of monsoons and beginning of winter. Conclusion: Though the prevalence of HAV is much higher than that of HEV, co-infection rate of 11. 5 % mandates the screening for HEV which will be of immense importance in pregnant women and improving levels of personal hygiene among higher socio-economic population.

In Nigeria, there is no epidemiological data on children for this infection. A community based study was carried out to establish the seroprevalence and predictors of this infection in children. Methods: A community based cross sectional study {{was carried out in}} Akpabuyo local Government Area of Cross River State in southern Nigeria. Multi- staged sampling technique was used to recruit 406 children aged 1 - 18 years. Blood samples were analysed for <b>anti-HAV</b> total antibody (<b>IgM</b> and IgG) using a commercial Enzyme-Linked Immunoassay Assay(ELISA). A multivariate logistic regression was used t...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} to test the {{feasibility}} of using urine for diagnosing hepatitis A virus (HAV) infections. A correlation of 90. 78 % between the test results of urine and serum samples was obtained. Four outbreaks of hepatitis A were confirmed by testing only urine samples. The levels of <b>anti-HAV</b> immunoglobulin M (<b>IgM)</b> antibodies in urine samples remained stable during 6 months of storage at − 70 °C but decreased when the samples were stored at 4 °C. The results of tests of samples obtained 2 and 6 months after infection suggested that IgM levels decline more rapidly in urine than in serum...|$|R
40|$|Recently, a {{changing}} pattern of hepatitis A epidemiology {{has been reported}} in the Indian population indicating a rise in the rate of hepatitis A infection among adults. The study's objective was to assess anti-HAV prevalence in voluntary blood donors from middle and high socioeconomic strata. Serum samples collected from voluntary blood donors from Pune city and its suburbs in the years 2002 and 2004 – 2005 were tested for anti-HAV IgG antibodies. Serum samples collected during 2004 – 2005 were examined for <b>anti-HAV</b> <b>IgM</b> antibodies. Positive samples were tested for HAV-RNA. Agewise anti-HAV positivity was significantly low in adults aged 18 – 25 years (90 · 4 %) compared to those aged > 25 years (97 · 4 %) (P< 0 · 01). A decline in anti-HAV prevalence was significant in 2004 – 2005 compared to that in 2002 (96 · 5 % vs. 92 · 1 %) (P< 0 · 01). Overall, in both adult age groups, the proportion of anti-HAV positivity was remarkably low in the high socioeconomic group (HSG) (88 · 96 %) compared to that of the middle socioeconomic group (MSG) (95 · 86 %) (P< 0 · 01). <b>Anti-HAV</b> <b>IgM</b> positivity was not significant (~ 1 %), however, presence of HAV-RNA in one of the samples indicated the possibility of horizontal transmission of HAV. Increase in seronegativity to HAV in HSG implicates a rise in the susceptible pool and indicates the need for vaccination against hepatitis A...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Viral {{hepatitis}} A {{is still}} a concern at public health level in Brazil and around the world, due both {{to the number of}} affected subjects and the possibility of complications in the acute forms. The Brazilian Ministry of Health estimates that at least 70 % of this country's population has already had contact with the hepatitis A virus (HAV). The aim here was to discover the prevalence of serological markers for the hepatitis A virus among children and teenagers at daycare facilities, kindergartens and elementary schools in the city of Santos. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study in kindergartens and elementary schools within the municipal education network in several regions of the city of Santos. METHOD: Students' family members were surveyed using a questionnaire and 4, 680 finger-prick blood samples were taken and assayed by means of the ELISA technique. RESULTS: The general prevalence of anti-HAV IgG was 9. 72 % and, of these cases, 74. 6 % were reactive to <b>anti-HAV</b> <b>IgM.</b> There was higher prevalence of anti-HAV IgG among older children, females, children who played in streams, those whose homes were not connected to the sewage system, those whose parents had low education levels, those with low household income {{and those who did not}} live along the seashore. The prevalence of <b>anti-HAV</b> <b>IgM</b> peaked in the early years and subsequently fell, and it was lower on the hills and in the Northwestern Zone. CONCLUSION: The general prevalence of serological markers for hepatitis A was low in Santos...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and {{hepatitis}} E virus (HEV) infections occur chiefly as {{a result}} of unhygienic conditions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the seroprevalence of antibodies to both viruses in central Burkina Faso in the absence of a recorded hepatitis epidemic. Serum samples from 178 blood donors (131 males and 47 females) and from 189 pregnant women were collected from November 2010 to March 2012, at blood banks and medical centers in Burkina Faso. An immunochromatography test was used to screen for <b>Anti-HAV</b> <b>IgM</b> and IgG in a subgroup of 91 blood donors and 100 pregnant women. The seroprevalence of anti-HAV IgG was 14. 3 % [CI 95, 7. 1 – 21. 4 %] for all blood donors and 23 % [CI 95, 14. 8 – 31. 2 %] for pregnant women. Anti-HEV IgG were detected using the ELISA kits Dia. pro and Wantai and were found in 19. 1 % [CI 95, 13. 3 – 24. 9 %] of the blood donors and 11. 6 % [CI 95, 7. 1 – 16. 2 %] of the pregnant women. The seroprevalences of anti-HAV and anti-HEV IgGs did not differ significantly between men and women blood donors. <b>Anti-HAV</b> <b>IgM</b> was detected in 3. 3 % of the blood donors and in 2 % of the pregnant women. These findings for asymptomatic individuals indicate that the HAV and HEV circulate at low but significant levels. This is the first evaluation of the acute hepatitis virus burden i...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} numbers of studies investigating hepatitis A diagnostic through saliva, the frequency and the pattern of hepatitis A virus (HAV) markers in this fluid still remains unknown. To address this issue, we carried on a longitudinal study to examine the kinetics of HAV markers in saliva, in comparison with serum samples. The present study followed-up ten patients with acute hepatitis A infection during 180 days post diagnosis (dpd). Total anti-HAV was detected in paired serum and saliva samples {{until the end of}} the follow-up, showing a peak titer at 90 th. However, total anti-HAV level was higher in serum than in saliva samples. This HAV marker showed a probability of 100 % to be detected in both serum and saliva during 180 dpd. The <b>IgM</b> <b>anti-HAV</b> could be detected in saliva up to 150 dpd, showing the highest frequency at 30 th, when it was detected in all individuals. During the first month of HAV infection, this acute HAV marker showed a detection probability of 100 % in paired samples. The detection of <b>IgM</b> <b>anti-HAV</b> in saliva was not dependent on its level in serum, HAV-RNA detection and/or viral load, since no association was found between <b>IgM</b> <b>anti-HAV</b> positivity in saliva and any of these parameter (p> 0. 05). Most of the patients (80 %) were found to contain HAV-RNA in saliva, mainly at early acute phase (30 th day). However, it was possible to demonstrate the HAV RNA presence in paired samples for more than 90 days, even after seroconversion. No significant relationship was observed between salivary HAV-RNA positivity and serum viral load, demonstrating that serum viral load is not predictive of HAV-RNA detection in saliva. Similar viral load was seen in paired samples (on average 104 copies/mL). These data demonstrate that the best diagnostic coverage can be achieved by salivary anti-HAV antibodies and HAV-RNA tests during 30 - 90 dpd. The long detection and high probability of specific-HAV antibodies positivity in saliva samples make the assessment of salivary antibodies a useful tool for diagnosis and epidemiological studies. The high frequency of HAV-RNA in saliva and the probability of detection of about 50 %, during the first 30 dpd, demonstrate that saliva is also useful for molecular investigation of hepatitis A cases, mainly during the early course of infection. Therefore, the collection of saliva may provide a simple, cheap and non-invasive means of diagnosis, epidemiological surveys and monitoring of hepatitis A infection purposes...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is {{the most}} {{important}} cause of acute infectious hepatitis worldwide. In Portugal, due to improvements in sanitation epidemic outbreaks of HAV infection have become less frequent. This report is the first, to our knowledge that characterized HAV in Portugal. For the detection and molecular characterization of HAV cases in a group of Portuguese individuals in the Lisbon area, 31 serum samples were tested: 8 from symptomatic children from an acute hepatitis A outbreak in a Roma (Gipsies) community (2004 – 2005), and 22 from patients with acuteHAV from sporadic cases (2005 – 2006). A sample of CSF involved in a case of meningitis was also included. <b>IgM</b> <b>anti-HAV</b> detection and nested reverse transcription (RT-PCR), with primers located at the VP 1 -P 2 a region, was undertaken to detect HAV genome. In positive samples, molecular characterization was followed by phylogenetic analysis. All samples (n¼ 31) were positive for <b>IgM</b> <b>anti-HAV.</b> HAV RNA was found in 96. 7 % of cases. All isolates were classified as genotype I: 22 belonged to sub-genotype IA (73. 3 %), and 8 to sub-genotype IB (26. 7 %). All strains obtained from an acute HAV outbreak had sub-genotype IA, in which seven isolates (87. 5 %) had identical sequences. In HAV sporadic cases sub-genotypes IA and IB were identified, and this may reflect the co-circulation of these two subgenotypes in Portugal. Molecular epidemiology of HAV infection in this group of Portuguese appears to be similar to other European countries. HAV phylogenetic studies can provide important information for the design of appropriate public health measures...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is {{classified}} as Hepatovirus within the Picornaviridae. 1 In virology, HAV is a positively stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus of about 7, 500 nucleotides. 2 The viral capsid is composed of three exposed polypeptides VP 1, VP 2, VP 3, and a putative VP 4, with a highly conserved antigenic structure. 3 HAV is transmitted through fecal to oral route and is diagnosed by positive serum <b>IgM</b> <b>anti-HAV</b> antibody test. Isolates of HAV are of a single serotype, but human isolates can be categorized into three genotypes (I, II and III) with 2 subgenotypes (A and B for I and III).
