5|$|A strong {{tropical}} wave accompanied with a {{low pressure}} system moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on August 19. It moved quickly westward and organized, developing banding features and cirrus outflow near the blossoming convection. The wave nearly developed into a tropical cyclone on August 21, though its fast forward motion dislocated the low level circulation from the deep convection. The wave entered an area of dry air in the central Atlantic Ocean, and by late on August 22 most of the convection dissipated from the system. On August 24, convection increased as the wave passed through the Lesser Antilles, though strong southwesterly upper level wind shear prevented further development. The tropical wave moved through the Caribbean Sea, <b>and</b> <b>developed</b> deep convection due to more favorable conditions over the Gulf of Honduras on August 28. The wave crossed the Yucatán Peninsula, <b>and</b> <b>developed</b> a surface low pressure area on the 29th in the Gulf of Mexico. Convection continued to organize, and the tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Eleven on August 30 while located 335miles (540km) east-southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas.|$|E
40|$|Concerns that (1) {{growth in}} {{developing}} countries could worsen the US terms of trade and (2) that increased US trade with developing countries will increase US wage inequality both implicitly reflect the assumption that goods produced in the United States <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries are close substitutes and that specialization is incomplete. In this paper we show on the contrary that there are distinctive patterns of international specialization <b>and</b> that <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries export fundamentally different products, especially those classified as high tech. Judged by export shares, the United States <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries specialize in quite different product categories that, for the most part, do not overlap. Moreover, even when exports are classified in the same category, there are large and systematic differences in unit values that suggest the products made by <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries are not very close substitutes—developed country products are far more sophisticated. This generalization is already recognized in the literature {{but it does not}} hold for all types of products. Export unit values of <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries of primary commodity–intensive products are typically quite similar. Unit values of standardized (low-tech) manufactured products exported by <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries are somewhat similar. By contrast, the medium- and high-tech manufactured exports of <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries differ greatly. This finding has important implications. While measures of across product specialization suggest China and other Asia...|$|R
