The certainty principle for quantum systems is formulated and proved. It turns out that the certainty principle is closely connected with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (it presents, in some sense, an opposite point of view).

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the use of the various color pieces of {{information}} for segmenting color images and sequences with mathematical morphology operators. It is divided in four parts. The first one is concerning the choice of the color space suitable for morphological processing. The choice of a connection which induces a specific segmentation is discussed in section 2. Section 3 presents the color segmentation approach which is based on a non-parametric pyramid of watersheds, with a comparative study of different color gradients. In section 4 is introduced another multiscale color segmentation algorithm, relying on the merging of chromatic-achromatic partitionsordered by the saturation component. 1. CHOICE OF A COLOR SPACE A recent study [7] has shown that many color spaces (HLS, HSV, [...] .) having been developed for computer graphic applications, are unsuited to image processing. A convenient representation must yield distances, or norms, and provide independence between chromatic and achromatic components. We adopt here an improved family of HLS systems that satisfy these prerequisites, and compare it with other spaces, such as Lab. This space is named: Improved HLS (IHLS). There are three versions of IHLS: using the norm L 1, the norm L 2 or the norm max; min. The equations of transformation between RGB and the new HLS systems are given in [7] [13]. For the sake of simplicity, all the examples of the paper were obtained according to the equations: L = 0 : 212 R + 0 : 715 G + 0 : 072 B, S = max(R � G � B); min(R � G � B), H 0 = <b>arcco...</b>|$|R

RealNetworks contended that Sony <b>ARccOS</b> and Macrovision RipGuard are not effective copy control measure because they only prolong the copying process. The district court rejected this argument because <b>ARccOS</b> and RipGuard may make copying {{take so long}} that copying is essentially not viable.

Finally, RealNetworks asserted that regular DVD players can make temporary copies as cache, so <b>ARccOS</b> and RipGuard do not prevent copying. However, the court deemed this argument flawed by distinguishing that cache copies are byproduct of playback, but copies made by RealDVD are permanent.|$|E
