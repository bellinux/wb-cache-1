25|$|In 1990 {{while working}} at Stanford University on large bioinformatic applications, Greg Cooper proved that exact {{inference}} in Bayesian networks is NP-hard. This result prompted a surge in research on approximation algorithms {{with the aim of}} developing a tractable approximation to probabilistic inference. In 1993, Paul Dagum and Michael Luby proved two surprising results on the complexity of approximation of probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks. First, they proved that there is no tractable deterministic algorithm that can approximate probabilistic inference to within an <b>absolute</b> <b>error</b> ɛ< 1/2. Second, they proved that there is no tractable randomized algorithm that can approximate probabilistic inference to within an <b>absolute</b> <b>error</b> ɛ < 1/2 with confidence probability greater than 1/2.|$|E

The graph {{on the right}} plots the error of the function (that is, the error of the approximation {{after it has been}} improved by running one iteration of Newton's method), for inputs starting at 0.01, where the standard library gives 10.0 as a result, while InvSqrt (...) gives 9.982522, making the difference 0.017479, or 0.175%. The <b>absolute</b> <b>error</b> only drops from then on, while the relative error stays within the same bounds across all orders of magnitude.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of different muscle length and visual feedback information (VFI) on accuracy of isometric contraction of elbow flexors in men after an ischemic stroke (IS). Materials and Methods. Maximum voluntary muscle contraction force (MVMCF) and accurate determinate muscle force (20 % of MVMCF) developed during an isometric contraction of elbow flexors in 90 ° and 60 ° of elbow flexion were measured by an isokinetic dynamometer in healthy subjects (MH, n= 20) and subjects after an IS during their postrehabilitation period (MS, n= 20). Results. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the isometric contraction of the elbow flexors <b>absolute</b> <b>errors</b> were calculated. The <b>absolute</b> <b>errors</b> provided information about the difference between determinate and achieved muscle force. Conclusions. There is a tendency that greater <b>absolute</b> <b>errors</b> generating determinate force are made by MH and MS subjects in case of a greater elbow flexors length despite presence of VFI. <b>Absolute</b> <b>errors</b> also increase in both groups in case of a greater elbow flexors length without VFI. MS subjects make greater <b>absolute</b> <b>errors</b> generating determinate force without VFI in comparison with MH in shorter elbow flexors length...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of visual feedback information (VFI) on the isometric contraction of the forearm flexor muscles in men and women after an ischemic stroke when doing a physical load at 20 % of strength. Material and Methods. The study included healthy subjects (n= 20) and subjects after ischemic stroke (n= 20). The study was conducted in Lithuanian Academy of Physical Education. The measurements of maximum voluntary strength (MVS) and accurate isometric contraction were performed using an isokinetic dynamometer Biodex System Pro 3. Results. The <b>absolute</b> <b>errors</b> of isometric contraction of the right arm muscles at 20 % of MVS were similar in all the groups during the attempt with visual feedback information. The smallest <b>absolute</b> <b>errors</b> of the healthy subjects were 1. 42 ± 0. 35 Nm when the task was performed with visual feedback and the greatest <b>absolute</b> <b>errors</b> were 4. 69 ± 0. 95 Nm (P< 0. 01) while performing the task without visual feedback. Meanwhile, the smallest and greatest <b>absolute</b> <b>errors</b> of the subjects after ischemic stroke were 1. 32 ± 0. 45 Nm and 5. 05 ± 0. 63 Nm, respectively, while performing the task without visual feedback (P< 0. 01). Conclusions. Maximum voluntary strength was greater in all the groups of men. The <b>absolute</b> <b>errors</b> of isometric contractions of the right and left arm muscles tended to increase in both the men and the women when there was no visual feedback information. The women and the men after an ischemic stroke produced greater <b>absolute</b> <b>errors</b> when performing the task with the right and left arm without visual feedback information than the healthy subjects...|$|R

Thus (L(y-y_n))(x_i)= 0. Because L(y-y_n) fluctuates, the fluctuation of y-y_n is possible. The fluctuation times of <b>absolute</b> <b>errors</b> {{are related to the}} number of nodes n+ 1.

In practice, measurement results are often given with a certain number of digits after the decimal point, which indicate the error bounds. For example, although 0.080 and 0.08 denote the same real number, the numeral 0.080 is to suggest a measurement with an error less than 0.001, while the numeral 0.08 indicates an <b>absolute</b> <b>error</b> bounded by 0.01.
