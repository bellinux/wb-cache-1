5|$|As a belated {{homage to}} his late father-in-law, Bizet {{took up the}} Noé {{manuscript}} and completed it. Parts of his moribund Vasco da Gama and Ivan IV were incorporated into the score, but a projected production at the Théâtre Lyrique failed to materialise when Carvalho's company finally went bankrupt, and Noé remained unperformed until 1885. Bizet's marriage was initially happy, but was affected by Geneviève's nervous instability (inherited from both her parents), her difficult relations {{with her mother and}} by Mme. Halévy's interference in the couple's affairs. Despite this, Bizet kept on good terms with his mother-in-law and maintained an extensive correspondence with her. In the year following the marriage, he considered plans for <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> new operas and began to sketch the music for two of them: Clarissa Harlowe based on Samuel Richardson's novel Clarissa, and Grisélidis with a libretto from Victorien Sardou. However, his progress on these projects was brought to a halt in July 1870, with the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War.|$|E

2500|$|Approximately every [...] - {{a typical}} day's journey for an ox-drawn wagon - was a mansio (literally: [...] "a sojourn", from which derive the English word [...] "mansion" [...] and French maison or [...] "house"). This was a {{full-scale}} wayside inn, with large stables, tavern, rooms for travellers and even bath-houses {{in the larger}} establishments. Mansiones also housed detachments of troops, primarily auxiliaries, which regularly garrisoned and patrolled the roads along their whole length. These would check the identities, travel permits and cargoes of road users. Mansiones may also have housed the agents of the imperial procurator (the chief financial officer in the province) who collected the portorium, an imperial toll on goods in transit on public roads that was charged at 2% - 2.5% of the value. The tax would be exacted when the goods crossed fixed toll points along the roads, which likely were located in or near mansiones. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> sites have been positively identified as mansiones in Britain. e.g. the excavated mansio at Godmanchester (Durovigutum) on Ermine Street (near Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire).|$|E
