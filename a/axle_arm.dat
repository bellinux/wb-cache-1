50|$|Beneath the {{carriage}} body is the undergear or undercarriage (or simply carriage), {{consisting of the}} running gear and chassis. The wheels and axles, in distinction from the body, are the running gear. The wheels revolve upon bearings or a spindle {{at the ends of}} a bar or beam called an axle or axletree. Most carriages have either one or two axles. On a four-wheeled vehicle, the forward part of the running gear, or forecarriage, is arranged to permit the front axle to turn independently of the fixed rear axle. In some carriages a 'dropped axle', bent twice at a right angle near the ends, allows a low body with large wheels. A guard called a dirtboard keeps dirt from the <b>axle</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{carriage}} M8 was identical, {{except for}} <b>axle</b> <b>arms</b> and wheels, which were metal with pneumatic tires. The howitzer on carriage M8 could {{be broken down}} into seven mule loads or into nine parachute loads (the latter arrangement included 18 rounds of ammunition). It could also be towed by vehicle such as 1/4 ton jeep, or transported by plane or glider such as CG-4 Waco.|$|R
2500|$|The plateway {{was one of}} {{the first}} users of the patent [...] that was {{designed}} by John Collinge of Bridge Road, Lambeth. This axle was largely used for road vehicles and a few other applications to rail vehicles. It implies that the wheels rotated on fixed axles, and, until its introduction, wheels had to be removed and <b>axle</b> <b>arms</b> greased at least once a day when travelling any distance.|$|R
40|$|Bachelor thesis {{contains}} kinematics {{analysis of}} semi-trailing <b>arm</b> <b>axle</b> and her effect on driving properities. Further is work conversant by design of this axle.

50|$|At high mileages, this {{is prone}} to wear of the axle {{mounting}} bushes which is easily fixed. It is also prone to wear in the rear <b>axle</b> trailing <b>arm</b> bearings, which then wear the trailing <b>arm</b> <b>axle</b> tubes, requiring an expensive rebuild or a replacement axle assembly. The diesel and larger capacity petrol engines are canted {{as far back as}} possible in the engine bay, in an effort to put as much weight as possible behind the front axle line, also reducing the centre of gravity, while improving weight distribution and minimising understeer.|$|R
50|$|Solid axle suspension: For a solid <b>axle</b> {{the lower}} <b>arms</b> control forward and {{backward}} motion, the upper arms control {{forward and backward}} rotation. This rotation is present under acceleration and braking.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made into}} the effects of mechanised logging and log skidding on some components of farm tractors used under the Tractor Hiring Units (THU) of the Ministry of Agriculture in Ondo State, Nigeria. Thirty tractors of various makes and models were examined after a period under logging operations based on a template of eight key criteria and thirty four sub criteria related to vital tractor systems and components. Data collected were analysed to determine {{the percentage of the}} components that are good, damaged but repairable or damaged or missing parts. The results show that the highest occurrence of failure are with worn out tyres (80 %), followed by broken rear work lights, headlamps and road warning lights (60 %) and broken lateral stabilizers (53. 3 %). Similarly, the least damaged components of tractors under the study were the tyre rims (66. 7 % good), wheel hubs and <b>axle</b> <b>arms</b> (56. 7 %) and hydraulic linkage arms and forks as well as brake pedal travel and release (46. 7 %) ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} other {{modifications}} were listed in the amendment (1/1V) to the TR7's homologation for the Group 4 TR7, such as larger front callipers and rear disk brakes. These were allowed {{from a list of}} [...] "Optional equipment which may be recognized without a minimum production". Other modifications that are not listed in the papers, such as suspension components and <b>axle</b> locating <b>arms,</b> etc., were given as freely allowed to be changed or added without need of being specifically recognized as part of the homologation process.|$|R

50|$|The {{familiar}} {{range of}} PSA powertrains drove {{the front wheels}} of a conventionally designed chassis. At the front was a standard MacPherson strut layout with anti-roll bar, while the rear used the PSA Peugeot-CitroÃ«n independent trailing arm/torsion bar set up that was first introduced on the Peugeot 305 estate. However, PSA's chassis engineers employed some unusual features, including passive rear wheel steering, though less than on the ZX, (by means of specially designed compliance bushes in the rear suspension), and in-house developed and constructed shock absorbers. At high mileages this is prone to wear of the axle mounting bushes which is easily fixed. It is also prone to wear in the rear <b>axle</b> trailing <b>arm</b> bearings, which then wear the trailing <b>arm</b> <b>axle</b> tubes, requiring an expensive rebuild or a replacement axle assembly. The diesel and larger capacity petrol engines are canted {{as far back as}} possible in the engine bay, in an effort to put as much weight as possible behind the front axle line, also reducing the centre of gravity, while improving weight distribution and minimising understeer.|$|R

It can safely clear big mine areas in a short time.|$|R
50|$|On {{arrival at}} the winery there is usually a mixture of {{individual}} berries, whole bunches (particularly with hand-picked grapes), stems, and leaves. The presence of stems during fermentation {{can lead to a}} bitter taste in the wine, and the purpose of destemming is to separate grapes from the stems and leaves. Mechanical de-stemmers usually consist of a rotating cage perforated with grape-sized holes. Within this cage is a concentric <b>axle</b> with <b>arms</b> radiating towards the inner surface of the cage. Grapes pass through the holes in the cage, while stems and leaves are expelled through the open end of the cage.|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} features {{coil springs}} over a solid <b>axle</b> with trailing <b>arms.</b> The split rear axle {{is tied to}} a heavy-duty coil spring suspension. Cone-shaped passages {{in the rear of}} the hull allow for high individual vertical roadwheel travel. Both axles are fitted with positive locking differentials which provide improved traction by preventing one wheel spin-out.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "drop through" [...] {{design has}} cutouts {{that allow the}} base-plate of the truck to {{protrude}} through the board, thus lowering the deck and providing more stability. In addition to this, drop through decks decrease grip, as the deck {{is closer to the}} <b>axle</b> and moment <b>arm</b> of the wheel. There is also less leverage on the truck, which makes turning negligibly more difficult.|$|R
50|$|Suspension {{was simple}} but {{effective}} with double wishbone and coil springs {{at the front}}, and a live rear <b>axle</b> with trailing <b>arms</b> and coils at the rear. Brakes consisted of discs at the front and drums at the rear. The suspension, steering gear, brakes and rear axle were adapted from the Vauxhall Firenza {{with the exception of}} the front brakes, which were the widely used Girling Type 14 Calipers.|$|R
50|$|A {{floating}} arm trebuchet {{has three}} points of contact where friction {{can interfere with}} efficiency. Friction when the counterweight is dropping down to the glide strike can be reduced by using silicone grease or a thin film of plastic on the drop channel. Friction of the wheel on the <b>arm</b> <b>axle</b> against the glide track should be managed in a similar way. To reduce friction of the sling on the launch track, the track should have a smooth surface.|$|R
50|$|The rear is {{conventional}} leaf springs, {{with solid}} <b>axle</b> and lever <b>arm</b> dampers, {{except that the}} (box) frame rails are slung under the axle. The wheels are 15 inches in diameter and 4.5 inches wide (increased from 4 inches {{after the first few}} TR2s), with 48-spoke wire wheels optional. Wire wheels were usually painted, either body colour or argent (silver), but matt chrome and bright chrome were also available. The front disc or drum brakes and rear drums have no servo assistance.|$|R
5000|$|The first version, the [...] "South African Reconnaissance Vehicle" [...] Mk I, entered {{service in}} 1940. It {{was a long}} {{wheelbase}} four wheeled chassis with drive to only one <b>axle.</b> It was <b>armed</b> with two Vickers machine guns: one in a cylindrical turret {{and the other in}} the left hand side of the hull. There were two large access doors in the rear. It saw a brief action against the Italian forces in the Western Desert and thereafter relegated to training use.|$|R
50|$|The ladder chassis {{was made}} by Alfa Romeo for the central-mounted engine, with {{straight}} rails from front to the rear end of the car; it was numbered 700316 as per engine number.The final suspension was all-independent, with âsilent blocâ bushes;front it consisted of double wishbones, with a thick sheet steel (4 mm) upper wishbone, lever-arm Houdaille hydraulic dampers, longitudinal torsion bars, and lower location through a transverse leaf spring; {{at the rear of}} swing <b>axles</b> and radius <b>arms,</b> with a transverse leaf spring and longitudinal torsion bars.|$|R
30|$|The X-Arm 2 [102] and ARMin [103] {{are both}} exoskeletons with {{the focus on}} {{providing}} the user with the most force and torque feedback. The X-Arm 2 provides force feedback to the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. It also provides torque feedback to the forearm and the wrist. The torque feedback may provide force feedback from a simulation of turning a dial on an <b>axle.</b> The <b>arm</b> of the exoskeleton attaches to the chest of the user with a lightweight vest. This device makes physical manipulation of objects in the simulation believable and real {{with the use of}} both force and torque feedback. The ARMin also provides force feedback to the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. In addition, it provides torque feedback to the forearm and wrist as well. The ARMin is a stationary device that is attached to the user. The X-ARM 2 and the ARMin allow for full arm movement, force feedback, and torque feedback, which would enhance the sense of presence of the user.|$|R
5000|$|In contrast, a {{floating}} arm trebuchet features a freely moving <b>axle</b> on the <b>arm</b> along a glide track. This {{allows for a}} higher drop height for the counterweight, which is allowed to fall down a linear [...] "drop channel". The arm is on a moving axle and the torque is acting on the entire structure, preventing stalling. This linear drop of the counterweight is more efficient in transferring potential energy to kinetic energy than the pendulum counterweight motion of a traditional trebuchet. [...] The higher the drop channel, the more energy is released, but this puts more strain on the mechanism.|$|R
500|$|Each {{end of each}} caisson is {{supported}} on small wheels, which run on rails on the inside face of the [...] diameter holes {{at the ends of}} the arms. The rotation is controlled by a train of gears: an alternating pattern of three [...] diameter ring gears and two smaller idler gears, all with external teeth, as shown in the picture. The large central gear is fitted loosely over the axle at its machine-room end and fixed in place prevent it from rotating. The two smaller gears are fixed to each of the arms of the wheel at its machine-room end. When the motors rotate the central <b>axle,</b> the <b>arms</b> swing and the small gears engage the central gear, which results in the smaller gears rotating at a higher speed than the wheel but in the same direction. The smaller gears engage the large ring gears {{at the end of the}} caissons, driving them at the same speed as the wheel but in the opposite direction. This cancels the rotation due to the arms and keeps the caissons stable and perfectly level.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a case study}} involving the dynamic ride performance of a 30 -ton, articulated dumper vehicle. The vehicle in question was originally fitted with a front-end, solid <b>axle</b> with leading <b>arm</b> mechanism. After an engineering design program, the vehicle was custom-fitted with a Timoney Independent suspension system. Extensive testing and modelling activities using LMS Virtual. lab MotionÂ® were undertaken to determine the productivity levels of each vehicle. It was demonstrated that the vehicle fitted with a Timoney suspension could achieve a productivity increase of up to 50 %. A health analysis is also presented which shows the Timoney Independent suspension system reduces the potential health risk...|$|R
50|$|The initial Firenza was {{available}} in a base model 1159 cc overhead valve and two models with overhead camshaft, in 1598 cc and 1975 cc variants. The latter was the same engine as used in the earlier Viva GT. Some six months after launch, in December 1971, performance was boosted when the engine capacities were enlarged to 1256 cc, 1798 cc and 2279 cc respectively. All models had a front-mounted four-cylinder engine driving the rear wheels. Suspension was double wishbone and coilsprings at the front, and a live rear <b>axle</b> with trailing <b>arms</b> and coils at the rear. The SL model in each engine size carried {{the highest level of}} trim.|$|R
50|$|The {{channel section}} chassis had {{suspension}} by leaf springs {{at the front}} and a mix of leaf springs and torsion bars at the rear. At the front semi-elliptical springs were used with radius arms controlling fore and aft movement of the <b>axle.</b> The radius <b>arms</b> were joined by a torsion bar {{across the front of}} the chassis to act as an anti-roll bar. At the rear the quarter-elliptical springs had their front ends mounted in a boss that was attached to a short transverse torsion bar which controlled the rotation of the boss making the suspension a hybrid arrangement. As at the front linked radius rods provided axle location and anti-roll properties.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} {{is typical}} of small hatchbacks with MacPherson struts in front located by an L-shaped lower arm. At the rear, Viva is fitted with a torsion beam <b>axle</b> and trailing <b>arms.</b> The suspension geometry has been optimised for better steering response and ride comfort. The 1000 cc models have power-assisted steering, optional auto transmission and also a front stabilizer. The 660 cc and 850 cc are barebones basic models, devoid of power steering and auto transmission. As the Viva is based on Daihatsu Mira Avy, a kei car, it has a compact exterior dimensions and a small turning radius. It is roomy for its class, with enough room to seat five adults.|$|R
50|$|Each {{end of each}} caisson is {{supported}} on small wheels, which run on rails on the inside face of the 8 m diameter holes {{at the ends of}} the arms.

5000|$|The {{floating}} arm trebuchet uses a counterweight held {{on top of}} a tall drop {{channel to}} transfer potential energy into kinetic energy. A projectile is loaded into a sling {{at the end of the}} throwing arm. Upon releasing the trigger, the counterweight is allowed to drop through the channel. This causes the wheel on the <b>axle</b> of the <b>arm</b> to impact the glide track, which is usually held steady with strong support beams. While this is happening, the wheel is moved backwards by the torque acting on the arm from the counterweight. [...] The arm then jerks forward and releases the projectile from the sling. To reset the device, the counterweight must be raised back to the original height and locked in with the trigger mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|Fixing {{understeer}} or oversteer {{conditions is}} achieved by either an increase or decrease in grip on the front or rear axles. If the front axle has more grip than a similar vehicle with neutral steer characteristics, the vehicle will oversteer. The oversteering vehicle may be [...] "tuned" [...] by hopefully increasing rear axle grip, or alternatively by reducing front axle grip. The opposite is true for an understeering vehicle (rear axle has excess grip, fixed by increasing front grip or reducing rear grip).The following actions will have the tendency to [...] "increase the grip" [...] of an <b>axle.</b> Increasing moment <b>arm</b> distance to cg, reducing lateral load transfer (softening shocks, softening sway bars, increasing track width), increasing tire contact patch size, increasing the longitudinal load transfer to that axle, and decreasing tire pressure.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Strategies for {{the design}} and {{construction}} of non-linear, 2 D and 3 D conjugated macromolecules are presented in this critical review. The materials, termed here as star-shaped structures, feature a core unit {{which may or may}} not provide conjugated links between arms that radiate like spokes from a central <b>axle.</b> The <b>arms</b> of the macromolecules consist of linear oligomers or irregular conjugated chains lacking a formal repeat unit. The cores range from simple atoms to single or fused aromatic units and can provide a high level of symmetry to the overall structure. The physical properties of the star-shaped materials can be markedly different to their simple, linear conjugated analogues. These differences are highlighted and we report on anomalies in absorption/emission characteristics, electronic energy levels, thermal properties and morphology of thin films. We provide numerous examples for the application of star-shaped conjugated macromolecules in organic semiconductor devices; a comparison of their device performance with those comprising analogous linear systems provides clear evidence that the star-shaped compounds are an important class of material in organic electronics. Moreover, these structures are monodisperse, well-defined, discrete molecules with 100 % synthetic reproducibility, and possess high purity and excellent solubility in common organic solvents. They feature many of the attributes of plastic materials (good film-forming properties, thermal stability, flexibility) and are therefore extremely attractive alternatives to conjugated polymers...|$|R
50|$|The FD (1967-72) was {{released}} {{at a time}} when the UK was undergoing a currency crisis as well as increasingly militant labour relations, resulting in rising prices and reduced quality. On paper, this new 1599 cc and 1975 cc overhead camshaft engine design (the Slant Four) was advanced, but suffered an out of balance couple which earned it the US tag 'Hay Baler'. The suspension design of the car was far less compromised than most previous British mass-produced efforts, featuring a live <b>axle</b> with trailing <b>arms,</b> Panhard rod and coil springs instead of the traditional leaf springs, and a double wishbone front suspension assembly, but the FD's on-road performance and durability were less than its on paper promise in standard form. Independent tuner Blydenstein could effectively transform the overhead cam Victors to fulfill their advanced specifications. The FD Victor was first shown at the October 1967 British Motor Show.|$|R
50|$|The GY-120 had an {{aluminium}} alloy tube structure, stressed to FAR 23 standard. Its parasol wing was unswept and of constant chord, carrying half span ailerons. The wing was supported from below by a {{fore and aft}} pair of inverted V-form struts from the upper fuselage longerons to the its centreline. These struts also supported a longitudinal inverted V kingpost to which landing wires were attached. Flying wires braced the wing from below to the lower fuselage. The fuselage was flat sided, the fin and rudder straight edged. The {{leading edge of the}} fin was swept and the deep, almost rectangular rudder reached down between the elevators, mounted on the tailplane {{at the top of the}} fuselage, to the keel. Two seats in tandem were placed below the wing in a continuous open cockpit. The GY-120 had a fixed conventional undercarriage, with the mainwheels on half <b>axles</b> and radius <b>arms</b> mounted on the fuselage centreline and near vertical rubber compression legs fixed to the fuselage sides. The mainwheels had brakes and the tailwheel was coil sprung.|$|R
5000|$|From 1936 to 1955, Fiat in Italy {{produced}} the advanced and very compact FR layout Fiat 500 [...] "Topolino" [...] or [...] "little mouse", the precursor of the 1950s Fiat 500, {{it was designed}} by Dante Giacosa. The inline four cylinder 569 cc [...] hp engine was placed right {{at the front of}} the chassis with the radiator behind it. This allowed for a sloping front and good legroom when combined with lowered seating. This also allowed Fiat to lower the roofline. Although nominally a two-seater more were often squeezed in behind the seats. Initially it had quarter elliptic leaf spring rear suspension, but with an <b>axle</b> locating trailing <b>arm,</b> that was upgraded to stronger semi-elliptic to cope with overloading by customers. The front suspension was independent and was used as the basis of the suspension of the first English Cooper racing cars in the 1940s that became successful in the 1950s. It had a four speed gearbox (when three was common) and all hydraulic brakes. It was a similar size to the Austin Seven but much more advanced. It was exported all over the world and produced at the NSU factory in Germany, Steyr-Puch in Austria and Simca in France. It was facelifted with American influenced 'full width styling' of the frontal panels after the war, with headlights integrated into the wings/fenders.|$|R
