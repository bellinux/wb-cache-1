25|$|In 2005, Akers-Jones briefly {{emerged from}} {{retirement}} to defend, before Hong Kong's Legislative Council, {{his role in}} zoning the Discovery Bay resort project on Lantau in the 1970s. Developers were allowed to build there with the stipulation that it would become a resort, {{but most of the}} units were later converted into luxury housing. Akers-Jones was involved in the original zoning decision as the then Secretary for the New Territories. With the new Hong Kong Disneyland having opened nearby and property prices having skyrocketed as a result, suspicions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> original zoning plan was never enforced have again come to the fore. He criticised the decision to call on an elderly man to testify on the matter, which happened some 30 years earlier. However, he revealed that colonial officials had abruptly changed the zoning of the Discovery Bay project, and gave it to new developers because they feared it would {{fall into the hands of}} the former Soviet Union.|$|E

This is no time to take any chance on information which might lead us to the slayer. This maniac must be captured. We believe that we are justified in going to any ends to halt this chain of murder. Bear in mind--this killer may strike at any one. He may strike at persons close to him. For that reason, we believe any person with information that may lead us to the murderer should act in the interest of self-preservation.|$|E

500|$|French {{ambassador}} Stanislas Ostroróg {{was involved}} in returning {{the remains of the}} Irish poet from France to Ireland in 1948; {{in a letter to the}} European director of the Foreign Ministry in Paris [...] "Ostrorog tells how Yeats’s son Michael sought official help in locating the poet’s remains. [...] Neither Michael Yeats nor Sean MacBride, the Irish foreign minister who organised the ceremony, wanted to know the details of how the remains were collected, Ostrorog notes. [...] He repeatedly urges caution and discretion and says the Irish ambassador in Paris should not be informed." [...] Yeats' body was exhumed in 1946 and the remains were moved to on ossuary and mixed with other remains. The French Foreign Ministry authorized Ostrorog to secretly cover the cost of repatriation from his slush fund. Authorities were worried <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> much-loved poet's remains were thrown into a communal grave, causing embarrassment for both Ireland and France.

500|$|An avid {{student of}} the game, in the 1950 FIFA World Cup Matthews stayed on to watch teams such as Brazil and Uruguay compete in the tournament after England's {{elimination}} – the English FA, manager and media all returned home to, as Matthews said, [...] "bury their heads in the sand." [...] Matthews regularly condemned the [...] "blazer brigade" [...] at the FA in his autobiography, slating them as [...] "conservative" [...] and stressing {{that many of them}} were Old Etonians; in his view they treated players and supporters poorly, demonstrated arrogance by ignoring competitions they did not control (the World Cup and European domestic competitions), and viewed innovations with excessive suspicion (for example the FA sanctioned only the use of floodlights in 1952 despite artificial lighting having been experimented with as far back as 1878, and for years insisted on using outdated kit such as heavy [...] "reinforced" [...] boots). Writing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> FA allocated only 12,000 of the 100,000 available tickets for the 1953 FA Cup Final to Blackpool supporters, Matthews wrote: [...] "I couldn't make my mind up whether they were dunderheads or simply didn't care about the genuine supporters who were the lifeblood of the game".|$|E

In another musical reference featured in the episode, several characters claim the real-life Canadian rock group Loverboy wrote a song <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> DNA of an elephant and pig will not splice. [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig" [...] includes several pop cultural references to films and television shows. The last line in the episode, [...] "That'll do pig", spoken by Cartman, is a reference to the final line of the 1995 film Babe, a movie about a talking pig, which Stone has described as one of his favorite films. When the boys try to tell Officer Barbrady about the clone, he suggests that the boys have seen too many episodes of the X-Files. In the scene in which Pip is introduced, Stan asks Pip about his peculiar name, but Cartman interrupts Pip during his answer. Pip's reply – [...] "my father's family name being Pirrip and my Christian name Phillip, my infant tongue--" [...] – is identical to the opening line of the Charles Dickens novel Great Expectations, which is narrated by its protagonist, Pip.

2500|$|The film's director, Oliver Hirschbiegel, spoke {{positively}} {{about these}} parodies in a 2010 interview with New York magazine, saying {{that many of}} them were funny and they were a fitting extension of the film's purpose: [...] "The point of the film was to kick these terrible people off the throne that made them demons, making them real and their actions into reality. I think it's only fair if now it's taken as part of our history, and used for whatever purposes people like." [...] Nevertheless, Constantin Film has taken an [...] "ambivalent" [...] view of the parodies and has asked video sites to remove many of them.

[...] Eaton-Lewis commented that [...] "a portrait which makes Middleton appear older, more distinguished, and more ordinary is judged to be unfit for purpose" [...] was [...] "depressing". Another art critic, Fisun Güner, a freelance visual arts writer, also criticised the painting, mentioning that the hair is painted in a spread out wavy cascade which starts {{to look like an}} advertisement for a shampoo. Fisun makes the observation that the blouse in the big-bow shape, which she is wearing covered up to the neck, makes her appear [...] "stiff and rather straight-jacketed". However, Fisun believed the eyes look bright and lively and the jewellery, which she is shown wearing, stated to belong to her mother-in-law, are earrings made of sapphire and diamond, which bring out an animated look in the portrait.|$|E

60|$|Mike went. Mr Waller {{was still}} sitting staring out across the aisle. There was {{something}} more than a little gruesome in the sight of him. He wore a crushed, beaten look, as if all the life and fight had gone out of him. A customer came to the desk to cash a cheque. The cashier shovelled the money to him under the bars with the air of one whose mind is elsewhere. Mike could guess what he was feeling, and what he was thinking <b>about.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> snub-nosed Edward was, without exception, the most repulsive small boy he had ever met in this world, where repulsive small boys crowd and jostle one another, did not interfere with his appreciation of the cashier's state of mind. Mike's was essentially a sympathetic character. He had the gift of intuitive understanding, where people of whom he was fond were concerned. It was this which drew to him those who had intelligence enough to see beyond his sometimes rather forbidding manner, and to realize that his blunt speech was largely due to shyness. In spite of his prejudice against Edward, he could put himself into Mr Waller's place, and see the thing from his point of view.|$|E
60|$|I {{regret that}} I {{am unable to}} pursue this subject much further; {{but there is one}} point I should mention. In Harvey's time, the {{microscope}} was hardly invented. It is quite true that in some of his embryological researches he speaks of having made use of a hand glass; but that was the most that he seems to have known anything about, or that was accessible to him at that day. And so it came about, that, although he examined the course of the blood in many of the lower animals--watched the pulsation of the heart in shrimps, and animals of that kind--he never could put the final coping-stone on his edifice. He did not know to the day of his death, although quite clear <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> arteries and the veins do communicate, how it is that they communicate--how it was that the blood of the arteries passed into the veins. One is grieved to think that the grand old man should have gone down to his tomb without the vast satisfaction it would have given to him to see what the Italian naturalist Malpighi showed only seven years later, in 1664, when he demonstrated, in a living frog, the actual passage of the blood from the ultimate ramifications of the arteries into the veins. But that absolute ocular demonstration of the truth of the views he had maintained throughout his life it was not granted to Harvey to see. What he did experience was this: that on the publication of his doctrines, they were met with the greatest possible opposition; and I have no doubt savage things were uttered in those old controversies, and that a great many people said that these new-fangled doctrines, reducing living processes to mere mechanism, would sap the foundations of religion and morality. I do not know for certain that they did, but they said things very like it. The first point was to show that Harvey's views were absolutely untrue; {{and not being able to}} succeed in that, opponents said they were not new; and not being able to succeed in that, that they didn't matter. That is the usual course with all new discoveries. But Harvey troubled himself very little about these things. He remained perfectly quiet; for although reputed a hot-tempered man, he never would have anything to do with controversy if he could help it; and he only replied to one of his antagonists after twenty years' interval, and then in the most charming spirit of candour and moderation. But he had the great satisfaction of living to see his doctrine accepted upon all sides. At the time of his death, there was not an anatomical school in Europe in which the doctrine of the circulation of the blood was not taught in the way in which Harvey had laid it down. In that respect he had a happiness which is granted to very few men.|$|E
