40|$|Prior {{research}} in the diffusion of innovations literature {{has focused on the}} eventual consumer of primarily utilitarian products, such as consumer durables and "high tech" products. This research focuses on a less-explored area of diffusion: diffusion channel intermediaries for primarily aesthetic products, such as art and music. Data were collected in the form of depth interviews with intermediaries in two <b>aesthetic</b> <b>product</b> categories, art photography and jazz. Interview data were supplemented with observations of the intermediaries in situ, as well as by ancillary documentation produced by and about the intermediaries. Employing a grounded theory methodology, these data formed the basis of a theory which suggests two distinct aesthetic intermediary types, and which constitutes two alternative diffusion paths. One intermediary type, labeled the Separable-oriented (Separable Conceptualization-Oriented Intermediary), conceptualizes innovations as occurring in singular products. The other intermediary type, labeled Connected-oriented (Connected Conceptualization-Oriented Intermediary), conceptualizes innovation as occurring in larger bodies of work, these bodies connected by the intention of the producer and/or the process used to create the product. These two intermediary types are further differentiated by the activities they pursue in their intermediary role, by the channel entities with whom they communicate, and by the categories they employ in their evaluation of the innovative product. Separable-orienteds are shown to pursue activities which commodify the <b>aesthetic</b> <b>product,</b> provide variety to their constituents, and enhance the entertainment value of the product for their constituents; they communicate with commercial entities and the general public; and they consider issues of divisibility and complexity when evaluating <b>aesthetic</b> <b>product</b> for possible facilitation. Connected-orienteds, on the other hand, are shown to pursue activities which decommodify the <b>aesthetic</b> <b>product,</b> provide themes for integration of the individual aesthetic products, and enhance the educational value of the product for their constituents; they communicate more readily with the artist than with commercial entities, and define their constituency less broadly than Separable-orienteds; and they consider issues of the product's complexity beyond a given threshold, and the product's potential to proliferate beyond its current incarnation when evaluating it for possible facilitation...|$|E

40|$|Consumers {{make choices}} based {{not only on}} {{functional}} product attributes (e. g., fuel economy) but also on non-functional attributes (e. g., vehicle form). Consequently, ignoring non-functional product attributes in demand modeling can lead to product designs less attractive to consumers. This dissertation focuses on two major non-functional product attributes: (i) <b>aesthetic</b> <b>product</b> form as a perceptual product attribute and (ii) services as external product attributes. A limitation in conventional discrete choice analysis is that it handles functional and non-functional attributes within a single demand model. An <b>aesthetic</b> <b>product</b> form is generated by a potentially huge number of geometric variables; thus, it cannot be quantified simply {{and it is difficult}} to integrate with functional attributes. Similarly, when considering services, it is challenging to incorporate the relationship (or channel) between product and service attributes (or multiple providers) into a single demand model. This dissertation proposes a multidomain demand modeling approach to integrate functional and non-functional attributes, whose values are decided by different design domains, into a single demand model. We employ consumer choice models from Marketing, systems design optimization from Engineering, machine learning algorithms and human-computer interaction from Computer Science, and location network models from Operations Research within a design optimization framework. This work addresses three demand models: (i) a demand model for engineering and industrial design, (ii) a demand model for engineering and service design, and (iii) a demand model for engineering and operations design. The benefits of this unified approach is demonstrated through three respective design applications including gasoline vehicle design, electric vehicle and charging station location design, and tablet and e-book service design. The contribution of this research is in helping resolve trade-offs between conflicted design domain decisions, by integrating disparate attributes into a multidomain demand model. This work consequently extends the scope of Design for Market Systems from product design to business model design by considering external product attributes...|$|E

40|$|This {{output is}} a {{portfolio}} comprising a score and {{recording of the}} community choral work, The Cathedral on the Marshes, together with documentation (in various media) relating to {{various aspects of the}} creative process including revisions made to the version used for the first two performances. The research investigates the degree of personal stylistic authenticity possible when creating a musical work entirely for community performance and reception; how a sense of ownership of the piece by the performers may be achieved and the nature of a close creative collaboration (with partners working simultaneously in close proximity). The key elements of the process of inquiry have comprised meetings and working sessions with the librettist, workshops with members of the choir (the materials from which were incorporated into the piece), the composition of an initial version of the work followed by its revision and focus groups with the musicians {{at the conclusion of the}} process. All sessions involving two or more participants have been recorded. The insights gained from the research reveal the degree of revision necessary to retain some stylistic authenticity whilst accommodating playing standards, repertoire knowledge, experience and understanding as well as the social function of amateur community ensembles. Close collaboration revealed the typical focus on process rather than <b>aesthetic</b> <b>product</b> and the need to prolong this stage of the process; once composer and librettist broke regular contact and ‘reverted to type’ the <b>aesthetic</b> <b>product</b> moved centre-stage- possibly causing the problematic proliferation of text in the first movement. The final insight concerns the levels of advocacy and leadership necessary for collaboration between composer and performers to occur and hence a stronger sense of performer ownership; the types of conflict Haydn and Windsor describe between the “written quality of compositions and the processes involved in bringing out… [their] sounding quality…” were clearly in evidence.

30|$|Results of {{the current}} study further showed that degree of SOP-visual was related to {{frequency}} of use of internal and impersonal external information sources. The results are consistent with previous studies showing consumers process and remember visual information easily, especially in processing information for high involvement products such as apparel (e.g., Khakimdjanova and Park 2005; Lurie and Mason 2007). Compared to low visualizers, high visualizers tend to use internal information sources more often, indicating that these consumers may store mental images of apparel products. The images may be based not only on new information from marketer-dominated information sources but also from their experiences and knowledge retained in memory. In addition, high visualizers more frequently used observed street-wear, store displays, fashion magazines, and catalogs as impersonal external information sources than low visualizers. Similar to the results of fashion leadership, high visualizers may prefer marketer-dominated information where they can obtain professional images reflecting functional and <b>aesthetic</b> <b>product</b> information. For example, store displays are carefully developed by retailers so that customers understand the aesthetic aspects of products as intended. Therefore, high visualizers may appreciate information gleaned from visual merchandising and, as a result, understand and remember the acquired visual information better.|$|E

40|$|The {{validity}} of using experimental techniques in aesthetic {{research has been}} questioned by asserting the private, intangible nature of individual aesthetic experience (Bollough, I 908; Mainwaring, 1941). The discussion appears to have its roots in a limited approach {{to the concept of}} aesthetics. Osgood (1957) has made a valuable distinction between the study of aesthetics as communication and the creation of aesthetic products. While the latter should-and will-remain an art, the former, like other behaviour, is open to scientific investigation and any instrument, quantitative or otherwise, that can facilitate such study is to be welcomed. An <b>aesthetic</b> <b>product,</b> like ordinary speech communication, has a dual nature, being the result of a response in the ‘sender ’ as well as a stimulus to the ‘receiver’. This stimulus has a cognitive content but differs from speech stimuli in that its ‘connotative meaning ’ tends to predominate over its ‘denotative meaning ’ owing to the large interindividual variation in the processes of coding and de-coding. “In the aesthetic attitude we linger over the sensations as pure sensations, fol-lowing the reverberations of the sound, inhaling deeply of the aroma, tracing th...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} avoid the expense of {{interactive}} evolution some researchers have begun using aesthetic measures as automatic fitness functions. This thesis explores the potential of one of the earliest aesthetic measures by George Birkhoff as a fitness function in vase design. Results suggest that Bezier curves provide a suitable representation for rotationally symmetric vases. Initial testing of vases of this form suggested that Birkhoff's original measure had some limited potential as a fitness function with some adaptations. However it had several flaws which could be exploited in the evolutionary process. These results have also revealed several further properties with a positive correlation with human-awarded scores. A suitable balance of these measures was found and vases evolved by the measure were assessed for their aesthetic potential by a group of volunteers. The final range of vases included many shapes similar to those developed by human designers. They show that at least within this test case it is possible to replicate the human design process. Coupled with 3 D printing techniques they allow automation of the whole process from conception to product. It is hoped that this demonstration of the theory will enable further work on other <b>aesthetic</b> <b>products.</b> ...|$|R

However, prior examinations of its effects involved manipulations with limited applicability outside the laboratory. Building on recent work suggesting that choice of highly <b>aesthetic</b> <b>products</b> can be a form of affirmation, we proposed and tested whether merely affiliating people with high aesthetics can affirm their sense of self and thus encourage openness to arguments advocating selection of one option over another. In three experiments we examined this effect in financial and consumer decisions where choices varied in their inherent risk. Across the experiments, after affiliating people with high (versus low) aesthetics, {{they were more likely to}} select the advocated option – whether that option was the riskier or less risky option. This occured using actual annual reports and a sample of experienced investors (Experiment 1), when the aesthetic affiliation and the choice tasks were in entirely unrelated areas (Experiment 2) and was driven by greater openness to arguments (Experiment 3). Together these studies offer a self-affirmation manipulation that is relevant and easily employed by practitioners in a variety of fields. They also provide novel insights on the link between aesthetics, self-affirmation, openness, and risk taking...|$|R
