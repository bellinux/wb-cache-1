5|$|Following the system's {{classification}} as {{a tropical}} cyclone, the depression maintained a west-southwesterly track {{in response to}} a subtropical ridge to the north. On July12, it is estimated that the depression intensified into a tropical storm, at which time it was given the name Gordon by the JTWC. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services <b>Administration</b> <b>also</b> monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Goring. During the afternoon of July13, Gordon briefly turned southwestward as it attained typhoon status before returning to a more westerly track later that day.|$|E

5|$|The {{return of}} {{democracy}} and government reforms beginning in 1986 were hampered by national debt, government corruption, coup attempts, disasters, a persistent communist insurgency, and a military conflict with Moro separatists. During Corazon Aquino's administration, U.S. forces withdrew from the Philippines, due to {{the rejection of the}} U.S. Bases Extension Treaty, and leading to the official transfer of Clark Air Base in November 1991 and Subic Bay to the government in December 1992. The <b>administration</b> <b>also</b> faced a series of natural disasters, including the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991. After introducing a constitution that limited presidents to a single term, Aquino did not stand for re-election.|$|E
5|$|About 18 hours later, the {{depression}} was upgraded to {{a tropical storm}} and given the name Dan. The cyclone moved westward at , and convection continued to mature. Outflow was good across most of the system, except the northwestern corner where it was restricted by interaction with a nearby typhoon. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services <b>Administration</b> <b>also</b> monitored the storm, assigning it with the local name Saling. The JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm on October 9; both agencies recognized it as a typhoon the next day after an eye became visible and outflow improved in the northwestern quadrant. Dan made landfall on the southeastern coast of Luzon in the Philippines, and its center tracked {{just south of the}} Ninoy Aquino International Airport.|$|E
5|$|After the {{northern}} circulation became the dominant center on October9, a deepening trough in the westerlies caused {{a decrease in}} synoptic pressures, resulting in Bess' forward motion greatly decreasing. Maintaining a west-northwesterly track, strong outflow developed, especially to the southwest of the circulation. The storm eventually intensified into a typhoon on October10 as it approached {{the northern}} Philippines. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the country, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services <b>Administration</b> <b>also</b> monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Susang. Later that day, Bess made landfall in northern Luzon, roughly 95km (60mi) south of Escarpada Point, with winds estimated at 120km/h (75mph). Though classified a minimal typhoon by the JTWC, the Hong Kong Royal Observatory reported that reconnaissance planes had recorded surface winds of 140km/h (85mph) before the system moved ashore. Inland, a barometric pressure of 976.9mbar (hPa; 28.85inHg) was recorded in Tuguegarao as the typhoon passed 55km (35mi) to the north.|$|E

5|$|In an August 10 Small Group meeting, the {{principals}} agreed to use Tomahawk cruise missiles, rather than troops or aircraft, in the retaliatory strikes. Cruise missiles {{had been previously}} used against Libya and Iraq as reprisals for the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing and the 1993 attempted assassination of then-President George H. W. Bush. Using cruise missiles also helped to preserve secrecy; airstrikes would have required more preparation that might have leaked {{to the media and}} alerted bin Laden. The option of using commandos was discarded, as it required too much time to prepare forces, logistics, and combat search and rescue. Using helicopters or bombers would have been difficult {{due to the lack of}} a suitable base or Pakistani permission to cross its airspace, and the <b>administration</b> <b>also</b> feared a recurrence of the disastrous 1980 Operation Eagle Claw in Iran. While military officials suggested bombing Kandahar, which bin Laden and his associates often visited, the administration was concerned about killing civilians and hurting the U.S.' image.|$|E
5|$|In early 2001, Boisselier {{promised the}} cloning {{of a human}} child within a year, drawing further {{attention}} to her work. A prosecutor in New York began investigating her compliance with local medical laws. Boisselier said that the Food and Drug <b>Administration</b> <b>also</b> surreptitiously investigated her, and Raël claimed that U.S. President George W. Bush was concerned about Clonaid's work. The caretaker of the laboratory that Hunt had rented grew suspicious about their work and contacted law enforcement. They spoke with the FDA, who searched the site and persuaded Boisselier to suspend her cloning work pending legal clarification. After Hunt {{was asked by the}} laboratory's caretaker to shut down the cloning operation, he broke with Boisselier and criticized her for seeking media attention. The caretaker also spoke publicly, saying that Boisselier was seldom at the laboratory. Boisselier then announced that she was moving her cloning operations overseas. Boisselier never faced any legal charges in connection with the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|In late August 1977, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} {{weather was}} noted south of Pohnpei. By September 1, a weak surface low accompanied by organized convection developed within the disturbance. Situated {{to the south of}} a Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough, conditions were favorable for further organization and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system. Tracking steadily west-northwestward in response to a well-developed subtropical ridge extending from the International Dateline to China, the system was soon classified a tropical depression early on September 2. Hours later, a weather reconnaissance mission into the depression revealed winds of 75 km/h (45 mph), prompting the JTWC to designate the system as Tropical Storm Babe. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services <b>Administration</b> <b>also</b> monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Miling.|$|E

5|$|Nine {{counties}} in Texas were declared disaster areas after Tropical Storm Fay: Brazoria, Frio, Galveston, La Salle, Live Oak, Matagorda, Nueces, San Patricio and Wharton. The declaration enabled business owners and residents {{to apply for}} federal and state government aid programs. Disaster housing checks handed out after the storm totaled to over $2.7million (2002USD; $3.1million 2007USD) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) had carried out over 2,700home and building inspections. Non-government relief programs such as The Individual and Family Grant Program had distributed over $400,000 (2002USD; $469,000 2007USD) in checks, and over $1million (2002USD; $1.2million 2007USD) in relief funds. The Small Business <b>Administration</b> <b>also</b> funded over $250,000 (2002USD; $294,000 2007USD) in relief aid.|$|E
5|$|On October18, a {{tropical}} depression formed {{just west of}} Palau. Tracking westward, the system attained tropical storm-force winds the following day and was assigned the name Hester. At this time, Hester was located approximately 400km (250mi) east of northern Mindanao in the Philippines. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the country, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services <b>Administration</b> <b>also</b> monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Goying. Early on October20, Hester brushed northern Mindanao before crossing the Visayas. The storm passed approximately 75km (45mi) south of Cebu City later that day before moving into the South China Sea. Early on October21, Hester intensified into a typhoon hours before crossing Palawan.|$|E
5|$|On September30, a weak surface low {{developed}} {{within the}} monsoon trough about 195km (120mi) south of Yap. Drifting northwestward, the system gradually organized into a tropical depression by October2. Later that day, aircraft reconnaissance revealed {{the system to}} have intensified into a tropical storm, at which time it was assigned the name Nora. The system's movement soon became slow and erratic, with Nora executing a counter-clockwise loop on October3. After completing the loop, it attained typhoon status and acquired a temporary northward trajectory. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services <b>Administration</b> <b>also</b> monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Luming. Late on October4, Nora began to undergo a period of rapid intensification. Several aircraft reconnaissance missions were flown by the U.S. Air Force 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron into the storm between October5 and 6, documenting the typhoon's dramatic strengthening.|$|E

5|$|The {{threat of}} the storm {{prompted}} officials in Taiwan to issue sea warnings for the island's southern coast, causing ferry service to two offshore islands to be canceled. A hot air balloon festival was canceled in Taitung City. On July8, the HKO issued a Standby Signal #1 for Hong Kong due to the increased threat from Linfa. On the next day, the agency upgraded it to a Warning Signal #8, indicating that gale-force winds were expected, although it was dropped in 5.5hours, {{becoming one of the}} shortest-lasting such warning. The local government opened 22shelters, housing 196people during the storm. The storm caused the Hong Kong International Airport to close, causing 1,020flights to be canceled. The China Meteorological <b>Administration</b> <b>also</b> issued 14warnings for the Chinese mainland, advising residents on the {{threat of the}} storm. Schools were closed in Guangdong due to the storm, while train service was canceled and 10,400boats returned to port. The Chinese government handled the preparations for Linfa at the same time Typhoon Chan-hom was threatening the country's east coast.|$|E
5|$|Following the extratropical {{transition}} of Typhoon Gay on May26, a spring-like weather pattern {{returned to the}} West Pacific, including a tropical upper-tropospheric trough (TUTT) and a strong ridge, which extended from the International Date Line to the Malay Peninsula. On June1, the monsoon trough re-developed over the South China Sea. Thunderstorm activity increased considerably on June8. Three days later, a weak disturbance was first noted {{just north of the}} equator. Although most of the convection was initially displaced from the center, the system began to show signs of organization on June15. Three days later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the disturbance. On June19, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) first identified the system; however, strong wind shear caused all the deep convection to become displaced to the south of the center. At 1800UTC, wind shear began to decrease, and the cyclone developed a well-defined circulation. Based on this, the JTWC upgraded the system into Tropical Storm Hal. Early the next day, the JMA classified Hal as a severe tropical storm. Around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services <b>Administration</b> <b>also</b> monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Kuring.|$|E
5|$|In late October1991, a {{tropical}} disturbance developed near the Caroline Islands. Tracking generally west-northwestward, the system gradually became more defined. On October31, convection {{associated with the}} system quickly increased, prompting the issuance of a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). Early on November1, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring the system as {{a tropical}} depression, at which time the system was situated roughly 415km (260mi) north-northeast of Palau. Following a satellite-derived surface wind estimate of 45km/h (30mph) later that day, the JTWC also began monitoring the low as a tropical depression. Initially, forecast models showed the system continuing on an arcing path out to sea; however, the system turned westward on November2 and threatened the Philippines. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the country, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services <b>Administration</b> <b>also</b> monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Uring. Late on November3, the depression turned west-southwestward towards the Visayas in response to an approaching cold front, an event typical of late-season cyclones in the basin. On November4, both the JTWC and JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm, with the latter assigning it the name Thelma.|$|E
