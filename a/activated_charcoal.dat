There are conflicting recommendations regarding whether to change the dosing of oral acetylcysteine after the administration of <b>activated</b> <b>charcoal,</b> and even whether the dosing of acetylcysteine needs to be altered at all.

40|$|The {{sorption}} {{of mercury}} vapor by adsorbed sulfur in the zeolites CaA (= 5 A) and NaX (= 13 X) and {{two types of}} active carbon has been measured at a temperature of 50 °C. With increasing degree of micropore filling by sulfur the fraction of sulfur accessible to mercury atoms decreased for CaA and NaX. The sulfur chemisorbed on carbon (only less than 0. 05 g sulfur per g) is not very active for mercury chemisorption. The mercury uptake shows a sharp maximum {{as a function of}} the amount of sorbed sulfur in the case of CaA, NaX and <b>activated</b> sugar <b>charcoal.</b> The oxidation rate of H 2 S with oxygen on NaX and <b>activated</b> sugar <b>charcoal</b> correlates with the capacity for mercury chemisorption, both {{as a function of the}} amount of sorbed sulfur.

However, symptoms often take longer than this to develop, and patients do not usually present for treatment until many hours after ingestion, thus limiting its effectiveness. Patients with severe vomiting or diarrhea can be rehydrated with intravenous fluids. Monitoring of biochemical parameters such as methemoglobin levels, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, urinalysis, and complete blood count is undertaken and any abnormalities are corrected. Dialysis can be used if kidney function is impaired or the kidneys are failing.

40|$|The {{difficulties}} {{associated with}} the growth of Legionella species in common laboratory media {{may be due to the}} sensitivity of these organisms to low levels of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radicals. Exposure of yeast extract (YE) broth to fluorescent light generated superoxide radicals (3 microM/h) and hydrogen peroxide (16 microM/h). Autoclaved YE medium was more prone to photochemical oxidation than YE medium sterilized by filtration. <b>Activated</b> <b>charcoals</b> and, to a lesser extent, graphite, but not starch, prevented photochemical oxidation of YE medium, decomposed hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radicals, and prevented light-accelerated autooxidation of cysteine. Also, suspensions of charcoal in phosphate buffer and in charcoal yeast extract medium readily decomposed exogenous peroxide (17 and 23 nmol/ml per min, respectively). Combinations of bovine superoxide dismutase and catalase also decreased the rate of photooxidation of YE medium. Medium protected from light did not accumulate appreciable levels of hydrogen peroxide, and autoclaved YE medium protected from light supported good growth of Legionella micdadei. Various species of Legionella (10 (4) cells per ml) exhibited sensitivity to relatively low levels of hydrogen peroxide (26. 5 microM) in challenge experiments. The level of hydrogen peroxide that accumulated in YE medium over a period of several hours (greater than 50 microM) was in excess of the level tolerated by Legionella pneumophila, which contained no measurable catalase activity.

5|$|Management {{is based}} {{primarily}} on stopping the usage of the precipitating drugs, the administration of serotonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine, and supportive care including the control of agitation, the control of autonomic instability, and the control of hyperthermia. Additionally, those who ingest large doses of serotonergic agents may benefit from gastrointestinal decontamination with <b>activated</b> <b>charcoal</b> {{if it can be}} administered within an hour of overdose. The intensity of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms. If the symptoms are mild, treatment may only consist of discontinuation of the offending medication or medications, offering supportive measures, giving benzodiazepines for myoclonus, and waiting for the symptoms to resolve. Moderate cases should have all thermal and cardiorespiratory abnormalities corrected and can benefit from serotonin antagonists. The serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine is the recommended initial therapy, although there have been no controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy for serotonin syndrome. Despite the absence of controlled trials, {{there are a number of}} case reports detailing apparent improvement after people have been administered cyproheptadine. Animal experiments also suggest a benefit from serotonin antagonists. Cyproheptadine is only available as tablets and therefore can only be administered orally or via a nasogastric tube; it is unlikely to be effective in people administered <b>activated</b> <b>charcoal</b> and has limited use in severe cases. Additional pharmacological treatment for severe case includes administering atypical antipsychotic drugs with serotonin antagonist activity such as olanzapine. Critically ill people should receive the above therapies as well as sedation or neuromuscular paralysis. People who have autonomic instability such as low blood pressure require treatment with direct-acting sympathomimetics such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine. Conversely, hypertension or tachycardia can be treated with short-acting antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside or esmolol; longer acting drugs such as propranolol should be avoided as they may lead to hypotension and shock. The cause of serotonin toxicity or accumulation is an important factor in determining the course of treatment. Serotonin is catabolized by monoamine oxidase in the presence of oxygen, so if care is taken to prevent an unsafe spike in body temperature or metabolic acidosis, oxygenation will assist in dispatching the excess serotonin. The same principle applies to alcohol intoxication. In cases of serotonin syndrome caused by monoamine oxidase inhibitors oxygenation will not help to dispatch serotonin. In such instances, hydration is the main concern until the enzyme is regenerated.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} initial treatment for ethylene glycol poisoning is stabilizing the patient. As ethylene glycol is rapidly absorbed, gastric decontamination {{is unlikely to}} be of benefit unless it is performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Traditionally, gastric lavage or nasogastric aspiration of gastric contents are the most common methods employed in ethylene glycol poisoning. The usefulness of gastric lavage has, however, been questioned, and it is now no longer used routinely in poisoning situations. Ipecac-induced vomiting is not recommended. As <b>activated</b> <b>charcoal</b> does not adsorb glycols, it is not recommended as it will not be effective at preventing absorption. It is only used {{in the presence of a}} toxic dose of another poison or drug. Patients with significant poisoning often present in a critical condition. In this situation stabilization of the patient including airway management with intubation should be performed in preference to gastrointestinal decontamination. Patients presenting with metabolic acidosis or seizures require treatment with sodium bicarbonate and anticonvulsives such as a benzodiazepine respectively. Sodium bicarbonate should be used cautiously as it can worsen hypocalcemia by increasing the plasma protein binding of calcium. If hypocalcemia occurs it can be treated with calcium replacement although calcium supplementation can increase the precipitation of calcium oxalate crystals leading to tissue damage. Intubation and respiratory support may be required in severely intoxicated patients; patients with hypotension require treatment with intravenous fluids and possibly vasopressors.|$|E

40|$|For {{sustainable}} development, {{the resources}} of the earth need to be maintained and carbon dioxide emission should be avoided. In particular, we need to find an alternative for the use of fossil fuels in vehicles. Since long, hydrogen has been recognised as the fuel of the future because it exhausts only water when used in fuel cells and hardly any pollutants when used in conventional internal combustion engines. However, the storage of hydrogen onboard vehicles is a major concern. Hydrogen is a very light and volatile gas. Extremely low temperatures or very high pressures are needed to store a practical amount for vehicular use. Since these options are regarded to be expensive and unsafe, a material is sought that is capable of storing hydrogen in a reasonable amount at close-to-ambient conditions. In this thesis, we present two options for hydrogen storage in materials: 1) high surface area materials such as single walled carbon nanotubes and 2) metals such as magnesium. We conclude that hydrogen storage on single walled carbon nanotubes is very much similar to hydrogen storage in ordinary <b>activated</b> <b>charcoals.</b> From a fundamental point of view, however, there are some distinct differences due to the curved surfaces of the nanotubes. Regarding hydrogen storage in magnesium metal we showed that structural changes in magnesium due to a ball milling treatment are not of decisive importance for the resulting increase in hydrogen sorption speed. By in-situ neutron diffraction, a new phase was found in Nb-catalysed magnesium that might {{play an important role in}} the increase of the sorption speed. Finally we point out why heat effects and storage efficiencies should be taken into account for practical storage systems. Applied Science...|$|R
