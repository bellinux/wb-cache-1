50|$|A new 8000 ft jet runway {{was laid}} {{down over the}} wartime 11/29 runway and the parking ramp was torn up and relaid with new concrete. Large, modern {{aircraft}} hangars were erected and a new station <b>area</b> built. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>dispersal</b> <b>areas</b> were also renewed, later in the 1970s being fitted with NATO Tab-Vee concrete shelters. A second <b>dispersal</b> <b>area</b> {{to the north of}} the main runway was also built to accommodate a second full aircraft squadron. Reconstruction was finally completed in 1956.|$|R
50|$|CLAWR is the {{northern}} {{equivalent to the}} United States Air Force's (USAF) Nellis Air Force Range and provides a different training environment with heavy boreal forest and numerous lakes more closely resembling European terrain. It hosts over 640 actual targets and 100 realistic target complexes, including 7 simulated aerodromes with runways, tarmac, <b>aircraft,</b> <b>dispersal</b> <b>areas</b> and buildings, as well as mechanized military equipment such as tanks, simulated radar and missile launching sites, mock industrial sites, and command and control centres.|$|R
2500|$|In 1950 when as {{a result}} of the Cold War threat of the Soviet Union, the {{airfield}} at Juvincourt was offered to the United States Air Force by the French Air Ministry as part of their NATO commitment to establish a modern Air Force station at the site. Some construction was performed, pouring an 8000' jet runway (05/23) to the south of the World War II airfield, along with <b>aircraft</b> <b>dispersal</b> <b>areas</b> at each end of the runway. [...] However the construction was never completed due to the high cost of breaking the agricultural leases, and also the high costs of removing the concrete German runways and other facilities. It was cheaper to build an airfield elsewhere and the land was simply sold off to private interests.|$|R

There are a number of large hangars, a control tower, numerous support buildings, and various housing areas. There are also more than 32 acres (130,000 m²) of ramp space and five <b>aircraft</b> <b>dispersal</b> <b>areas,</b> with over 110 revetments. Many support buildings and base housing built by the Soviet Armed Forces during their occupation were destroyed by years of fighting between various warring Afghan factions after the Soviets left.

2500|$|In World War II, <b>aircraft</b> <b>dispersal</b> {{and work}} <b>areas</b> with hard standings were built outside the old {{airfield}} area: north of Yewtree Lane by Fairey's area, and southeast of Altrincham Road (Styal) {{by the three}} southeast hangars. These were linked to by [...] "level crossings" [...] across those two roads, which were {{closed to the public}} except to those with a local resident's pass from early 1940 to mid 1945. After the war these hard standings were removed and the land was returned to farming, and the two roads became public again.|$|R
50|$|Seized by the Germans in June 1940 {{during the}} Battle of France, Athies {{was used as}} a Luftwaffe {{military}} airfield during the occupation. The Germans improved the facility by expanding the support area with numerous maintenance shops, hangars, and laying down two 1600m concrete all-weather runways, aligned 17/35 and 08/26. Numerous taxiways and <b>dispersal</b> <b>aircraft</b> parking <b>areas</b> were also constructed.|$|R
2500|$|Later in 1941, the Germans {{improved}} the facility into a permanent Luftwaffe air base by expanding the support area with numerous maintenance shops, hangars, and laying down two 1500m concrete all-weather runways, aligned 03/21 and 09/27 (A possible third runway, aligned 13/31 {{is visible in}} aerial photography, {{only part of the}} 13 (northwest) end still remains). [...] Numerous taxiways and <b>dispersal</b> <b>aircraft</b> parking <b>areas</b> were also constructed.

40|$|Nairobi National Park (NNP) {{is unable}} to {{incorporate}} the spatial and temporal dynamics of many migratory mammals that rely on the area as a dry season refuge because of its small size. During the wet season, wildlife {{must be able to}} migrate to the south into the Kitengela <b>dispersal</b> <b>area.</b> This area is privately owned and rapidly undergoing land-use change, which affects the structure and function of the dispersal corridors, jeopardising the ecological sustainability of the park. Private landholders in Kitengela incur most of the costs of keeping the <b>dispersal</b> <b>areas</b> open, but do not receive any compensation or revenue from benefits derived from tourism in the park. Here we present an analysis of the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for Nairobi and Kitengela residents for a new land management scheme in the <b>dispersal</b> <b>area,</b> in which local pastoralists leave their land open to wildlife and, by not engaging in fencing, land subdivision or poaching activities, receive monetary compensation for the incremental costs derived from use of their properties as a wildlife <b>dispersal</b> <b>area.</b> The results suggest that the aggregated financial support of urban residents might represent around $ 1. 2 million per year for 5 years. This amount exceeds the economic losses caused by wildlife in the <b>dispersal</b> <b>area,</b> and different financial schemes of fund investment and the prioritisation of conservation regions could be implemented to ensure payments and keep the dispersal corridors open in perpetuity...|$|R

However, many wildebeest populations are in drastic decline across the region (Estes and East, 2009).

40|$|Human–livestock–wildlife {{interactions}} {{have increased}} in Kenyan rangelands in recent years, but few {{attempts have been made}} to evaluate their impact on the rangeland habitat. This study identified drivers of increased human–livestock–wildlife interactions in the Meru Conservation Area between 1980 and 2000 and their effects on the vegetation community structure. The drivers were habitat fragmentation, decline in pastoral grazing range, loss of wildlife <b>dispersal</b> <b>areas</b> and increase in livestock population density. Agricultural encroachment increased by over 76 % in the western zone adjoining Nyambene ranges and the southern Tharaka area, substantially reducing the pastoral grazing range and wildlife <b>dispersal</b> <b>areas.</b> Livestock population increased by 41 %, subjecting areas left for pastoral grazing in the northern <b>dispersal</b> <b>area</b> to prolonged heavy grazing that gave woody plant species a competitive edge over herbaceous life-forms. Consequently, open wooded grassland, which was the dominant vegetation community in 1980, decreased by c. 40 % as bushland vegetation increased by 42 %. A substantial proportion of agro pastoralists were encountered around Kinna and Rapsu, areas that were predominantly occupied by pastoralists three decades ago, indicating a possible shift in land use in order to spread risks associated with habitat alterations...|$|R
