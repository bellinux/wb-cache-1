5000|$|... 2. Ni (two): Choke with forearm. This is an <b>air</b> <b>choke</b> {{with the}} forearm {{pressing}} on the throat.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>air</b> <b>choke</b> or {{tracheal}} choke specifically {{refers to}} a [...] "true" [...] choke that compresses the upper airway (trachea, larynx or laryngopharynx), hence interfering with breathing, and leading to asphyxia. Although less effective at inducing unconsciousness than its vascular counterpart, the <b>air</b> <b>choke</b> causes excruciating pain and air hunger, and in combat sports a fighter will usually submit to such a submission hold. Air chokes {{have been associated with}} fractures of the larynx or hyoid bone, and are considered less safe than blood chokes to practice. The arm bar choke is an <b>air</b> <b>choke</b> done by placing the forearm across the front of the neck from behind. The free hand grabs the wrist and pulls back the forearm, hence driving the forearm (usually the radius bone) into the front of the neck.|$|E
5000|$|Chokeholds can {{be divided}} into two primary categories: [...] "blood chokes" [...] and [...] "air chokes". A blood choke {{disrupts}} blood circulation to the brain, while an <b>air</b> <b>choke</b> disrupts breathing. Blood chokes can be applied to efficiently cause loss of consciousness, i.e. a choke-out, while air chokes do not usually cause loss of consciousness without prolonged application (though air chokes are used to cause discomfort).|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{its initial}} <b>airing,</b> <b>Choke</b> {{attracted}} 6.01 million American viewers {{and received a}} 2.5/8 Nielsen rating/share in the 18-49 demographic, down significantly from the 2.7/8 rating/share and 6.90 million viewers of the previous episode, [...] "Dance with Somebody", which was broadcast a week before.|$|R
50|$|Smoke {{filled the}} <b>air,</b> <b>choking</b> and {{blinding}} the children within two minutes. Firefighters arrived rapidly from fire station number 13 {{just across the}} street, but not fast enough to prevent the deaths of 78 children. Of the dead 12 were crushed, 64 asphyxiated; only 2 children actually died from the fire itself. The first firefighter to enter the building, Alphéa Arpin, discovered his own son, Gaston, aged 6, in the pile of bodies. Another man, Adélard Boisseau, discovered one of his 3 children. He would identify the bodies of his two other children later that evening at the morgue.|$|R
5000|$|The Enigma of Venus - Venus, the Sun's second planet, is a dark, broiling oven. It is a high-pressure, {{volcanic}} {{world with}} temperatures soaring above 500 degrees Celsius and <b>air</b> <b>choked</b> with carbon dioxide. How can the planets Earth and Venus, so similar {{in size and}} composition, be so different? The Enigma of Venus explores this unique planet's features, including its abundant volcanoes, which have been mysteriously inactive for {{hundreds of millions of}} years. Planetary scientists theorize on the current state of Venus, and speculate about what it can teach us regarding global warming on our own planet.|$|R
5000|$|The wrestler darts {{his hand}} under an opponent's chin {{and grabs a}} hold of a {{pressure}} point above the throat, squeezing the nerve. This cuts off the air supply and the opponent fades out, yet this is not considered an <b>air</b> <b>choke</b> as it is not squeezing the windpipe. This hold is unique in {{that it can be}} used as a sleeper like submission or, should the [...] "unconscious" [...] opponent end up lying on his back, a pinfall.|$|E
50|$|The main {{characteristic}} of Hadaka-Jime {{when compared to}} other Judo chokes {{is that it does not}} require the use of the opponent's clothing, namely his gi lapel, to create the choking tourniquet. It digs the blade of the wrist into the carotid sinus similar to the hand clasp method and uses a lever motion helped by the underhand. It is faster to apply requiring less strength than the figure four/mixed-martial arts version but is more difficult to learn. It is not an <b>air</b> <b>choke</b> but a carotid choke created entirely by the attacker's arms.|$|E
5000|$|Push choke [...] - [...] This can {{be applied}} a prone opponent, facing the person applying, by simply placing a hand to the throat, and pushing down, as the name implies. This is an <b>air</b> <b>choke,</b> and if left applied for too long, will result in {{fracture}} of the Hyoid bone in the neck, and death. Because of the high likelihood of death to the opponent, it is often not used in most fighting, and is an outlawed hold within the wrestling community {{because of the high}} chance of it being misdelivered, resulting in death.|$|E

40|$|This is an {{examination}} of the carotid choke, also known as the “sleeper hold. ” We will be concerned with types of sleeper holds, what part of the neck is affected, and how. This is commonly referred to as a “blood choke. ” There is differentiation between blood <b>chokes</b> and <b>air</b> <b>chokes</b> (strangulation). This article will cover application, effects, result over short and long terms, and ramifications of drug usage and mental state. We will not include the effects of a choke on the trachea, or pressure or strikes {{to the back of the}} neck. This article is presented from two perspectives; that of a martial arts practitioner/instructor and that of a physician. </p...|$|R
50|$|Subsonic ramjets do {{not need}} such a {{sophisticated}} inlet since the airflow is already subsonic and a simple hole is usually used. This would also work at slightly supersonic speeds, but as the <b>air</b> will <b>choke</b> at the inlet, this is inefficient.|$|R
5000|$|Chokes and {{strangles}} (commonly {{referred to}} as [...] "air chokes" [...] and [...] "blood chokes") are common forms of submission. In BJJ, the chokes that are used {{put pressure on the}} carotid arteries, and may also apply pressure to the nerve baroreceptors in the neck. This kind of choke is very fast acting (if done properly) with victims typically losing consciousness in around 3-5 seconds. In contrast, an <b>air</b> <b>choke</b> (involving constriction of the windpipe) can take up to two minutes, depending on how long the person can hold their breath, and may cause serious damage to the throat.|$|E
5000|$|Short wrist choke [...] - [...] In Judo, {{the rear}} naked choke {{is known as}} Hadaka-jime (裸絞め): [...] "rear naked choke", one of the 36 {{constriction}} techniques of Kodokan judo in the shime-waza list. It digs the blade of the wrist into the carotid sinus similar to the hand clasp method and uses a lever motion helped by the underhand. It is faster to apply requiring less strength than the figure four/mixed-martial arts version but {{is more difficult to}} learn. It is not an <b>air</b> <b>choke</b> but a carotid choke created entirely by the attacker's arms.|$|E
50|$|This {{variation}} (also {{known as}} Palm to Palm) has the supporting hand clasp {{the hand of}} the choking arm, allowing more pressure to be applied to the neck, but losing some of the control of the head. This alters the choke somewhat so that it {{is more likely to be}} applied as an airway-restricting choke or mixed blood and <b>air</b> <b>choke,</b> which results in more pain but a slower choke-out. As such, this technique is less frequently used at advanced levels in Judo. Nonetheless, it has seen some successful applications in mixed martial arts competition: for instance, it was used by Fedor Emelianenko, a heavyweight champion in PRIDE, to defeat Kazuyuki Fujita at the PRIDE 26 event in 2003. Fujita tapped out about five seconds after the choke was applied. He used it again to defeat former UFC Heavyweight Champion Tim Sylvia in 36 seconds. Sylvia tapped out immediately once the choke was sunk in and after the fight described it as being very painful. It was also used by Ultimate Fighting Championship fighter Matt Hughes to defeat Frank Trigg in their second fight which was adapted from a hand-on-biceps version of the rear naked choke.Anderson Silva also used the clasping hands variation when he defeated Dan Henderson in the UFC. Joe Lauzon used this choke in his fight against Melvin Guillard, initially using the standard version, then switching to a palm to palm.|$|E
5000|$|Most chokeholds {{featured}} in combat sports and martial arts are blood <b>chokes,</b> although some <b>air</b> <b>chokes</b> or combinations occur as well. Blood chokes, especially the rear naked choke, triangle chokes, or gi chokes, {{are commonly used}} as submission holds in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. In judo, chokeholds, known as shime-waza, are often subject to restrictions based on age or rank. Chokeholds are not allowed in sport sambo but are allowed in combat sambo. The chokeholds used in catch wrestling and shoot wrestling are {{the inspiration for the}} [...] "chokeholds" [...] in modern professional wrestling performances. Due to the effectiveness of chokeholds and their popularity {{in a wide variety of}} martial arts, they are most often used to force submissions in mixed martial art and submission grappling competitions.|$|R
60|$|Ffoulkes had to smother {{a cry of}} horror, which surely {{must have}} drawn the {{attention}} of that fiend on himself {{had he not been}} so engrossed in the enjoyment of his own devilry. As it is, he ran out of the stuffy eating-house, for he felt as if its fetid <b>air</b> must <b>choke</b> him.|$|R
50|$|A chokehold, choke, stranglehold or, in Judo, shime-waza (絞技; {{constriction}} technique) is {{a general}} term for a grappling hold that critically reduces or prevents either <b>air</b> (<b>choking)</b> or blood (strangling) from passing through the neck of an opponent. The restriction may be of one or both and depends on the hold used and {{the reaction of the}} victim. The lack of blood or air often leads to unconsciousness or even death if the hold is maintained. Chokeholds are used in martial arts, combat sports, self-defense, law enforcement and in military hand to hand combat applications. They are considered superior to brute-force manual strangling, which generally requires a large disparity in physical strength to be effective. Rather than using the fingers or arms to attempt to crush the neck, chokeholds effectively use leverage such as figure-four holds or collar holds that use the clothes to assist in the constriction.|$|R
60|$|Dreadful {{were the}} miseries we suffered--the misery {{of the heat}} beneath the stinking pelt of the lion, the misery of the dust-laden <b>air</b> that <b>choked</b> us almost to suffocation, the misery of thirst, for we could not get at our scanty supply of water to drink. But worst of all perhaps, was the pain caused by the continual {{friction}} of the sharp sand driven along at hurricane speed, which, incredible as it may seem, finally wore holes in our thin clothing and filed our skins to rawness.|$|R
40|$|The Strutjet {{approach}} to Rocket Based Combined Cycle (RBCC) propulsion depends upon fuel-rich {{flows from the}} rocket nozzles and turbine exhaust products mixing with the ingested air for successful operation in the ramjet and scramjet modes. A model of the Strutjet device has been built and is undergoing test to investigate the mixing of the streams {{as a function of}} distance from the Strutjet exit plane. Initial cold flow testing of the model is underway to determine both, the behavior of the ingested air in the duct and to validate the mixing diagnostics. During the tests, each of the two rocket nozzles ejected up to two pounds mass per second into the 13. 6 square inch duct. The tests showed that the mass flow of the rockets was great enough to cause the entrained air to go sonic at the strut, which is the location of the rocket nozzles. More tests are necessary to determine whether the entrained <b>air</b> <b>chokes</b> due to the reduction {{in the area of the}} duct at the strut (a physical choke), or because of the addition of mass inside the duct at the nozzle exit (a Fabri choke). The initial tests of the mixing diagnostics are showing promise...|$|R

40|$|Library (NEKL) System embraces all {{the current}} {{national}} {{economic and social}} crises in microcosm. It is {{an area in which}} suburbia, industry, government, and learning rub shoulders with the remnants of rural tradition. The factory worker in Lawrence finds the university relevant only two times a year, during football and basketball seasons. The university’s street society, on the other hand, feels put upon in having to share the community. The Oskaloosa farmer no longer farms; instead he commutes daily to the Goodyear or Dupont plants in Topeka since it {{is out of the question}} for him to think of moving to the city. The executive in Mission Hills worries about his property taxes, his pool, and his job. The assembly line worker is oblivious to the polluted <b>air</b> <b>choking</b> both Kansas Cities; his concerns are centered in getting out of the city and having safety on his neighborhood streets after dark. The regional library must effect a response to these manifestations of change. Somehow the library must find a means to relate to a clientele that is itself finding it increasingly dScult to relate to any situation. Moreover, the library must also deal with specific elements that are part of and hidden within the generalities of change. The disadvantaged are a prime example of this element. In Kansas, the varying degrees of disadvantageousness apply to the state’s black, Mexican-herican and Indian populations. There is no variation in this pattern in th...|$|R

For that fair land, like all things on earth, had its darker aspect. The foul exhalations of autumn called up fever and ague, crippling and enervating, and tempting, almost compelling, to that wild and desperate drinking which was the Scandinavian's special sin. Dark and sad were those short autumn days, when all the distances were shut off, and the <b>air</b> <b>choked</b> with foul brown fog and drenching rains from off the eastern sea; and pleasant the bursting forth of the keen north-east wind, with all its whirling snowstorms. For though it sent men hurrying out into the storm, to drive the cattle in from the fen, and lift the sheep out of the snow-wreaths, and now and then never to return, lost in mist and mire, in ice and snow;--yet all knew that after the snow would come the keen frost and the bright sun and cloudless blue sky, and the fenman's yearly holiday, when, work being impossible, all gave themselves up to play, and swarmed upon the ice on skates and sledges, and ran races, township against township, or visited old friends full forty miles away; and met everywhere faces as bright and ruddy as their own, cheered by the keen wine of that dry and bracing frost.|$|R

It was a wonder she was not run over, for she had no notion what she was doing, where going, and crossed the streets without the least attention to traffic. She came to Trafalgar Square, and stood leaning against its parapet in front of the National Gallery. Here she had her first coherent thought: So that was why his chambers had been empty! No clerk--no one! That they might be alone. Alone, where she had dreamed of being alone with him! And only that morning he had kissed her and said, [...] "Good-bye, treasure!" [...] A dreadful little laugh got caught in her throat, confused with a sob. Why--why had she a heart? Down there, against the plinth of one of the lions, a young man leaned, with his arms round a girl, pressing her to him. Gyp turned away from the sight and resumed her miserable wandering.

Plastic bags are known for their carcinogenic gas release after burning in <b>air,</b> for <b>choking</b> of sewage lines during monsoon season and the harmful effect on aquatic life. Government is promoting the use of paper bag to reduce plastic pollution. The project aims at designing a model of paper bag manufacturing unit, which would manufacture paper bags from A 4 size educational sheets also commonly known as assignment papers (21. 7 X 28. 8 cm). The assignments which each student write during his academic year are used as raw material for our manufacturing unit. The paper bags are designed by taking into consideration it’s cost, load carrying capacity and aesthetics. These paper bags have been tested at standard conditions and were found to have enough strength to replace plastic bag of 20 micron (10 X 14 cm). This project is based on reuse of papers for manufacturing paper bags instead of using recycled papers. It also aims on switching traditional manual method of paper bag manufacturing to low cost semi-automated system in order to achieve the goal of mass production of paper bags through automation. The motive behind doing this project is to manufacture paper bag which are easily disposable, cause no harm to environment and replace the current trend of using plastic bags in India...|$|R

A moment after Clarence's horse stopped with a sudden check, and the boy felt himself hurled over its head into the gully, alighting on something that seemed to be a bounding cushion of curled and twisted hair. It was the shaggy shoulder of an enormous buffalo! For Jim's desperate random shot and double charge had taken effect on the near hind leg of a preceding bull, tearing away the flesh and ham-stringing the animal, who had dropped in the gully just in front of Clarence's horse.|$|R
