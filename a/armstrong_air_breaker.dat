50|$|<b>Air</b> circuit <b>breakers</b> may use {{compressed}} air (puff) or the magnetic {{force of the}} arc itself to elongate the arc. As {{the length of the}} sustainable arc is dependent on the available voltage, the elongated arc will eventually exhaust itself. Alternatively, the contacts are rapidly swung into a small sealed chamber, the escaping of the displaced air thus blowing out the arc.|$|R

500|$|Throughout the United States, {{there are}} more than a dozen elementary, middle and high schools named in his honor, and many places around the world have streets, buildings, schools, and other places named for Armstrong and/or Apollo.

Purdue University announced in October 2004 that its new engineering building would be named Neil Armstrong Hall of Engineering in his honor; the building cost $53.2million and was dedicated on October 27, 2007, during a ceremony at which Armstrong was joined by fourteen other Purdue Astronauts. In 1971, Armstrong was awarded the Sylvanus Thayer Award by the United States Military Academy at West Point for his service to the country. The <b>Armstrong</b> <b>Air</b> and Space Museum, in Armstong's hometown of Wapakoneta, Ohio, and the airport in New Knoxville, where he took his first flying lessons when he was fifteen, were named after him.|$|R

50|$|Since the arc {{is entirely}} {{contained}} within the interrupter, switch-gear using vacuum interrupters can be very compact compared with switch-gear using air or oil as the arc suppression medium.

Vacuum interrupters {{can be used for}} circuit breakers and load switches. Circuit breaker vacuum interrupters are mainly used in the power sector in the substation and power grid facilities, while load switching vacuum interrupter is mainly used for power grid of the end user.|$|R
