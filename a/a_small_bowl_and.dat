Originally drawn with ranging (old style) figures, the current Monotype revival features ranging and lining figures.|$|E
6000|$|The mystic {{preparations}} {{were soon}} complete. A little cloud of smoke, {{through which the}} fierce red eyes of the astrologer peered keenly at Mr. Boxer, rose from the table. Then he poured various liquids into <b>a</b> <b>small</b> china <b>bowl</b> <b>and,</b> holding up his hand to command silence, gazed steadfastly into it.

Above these was a silver ladle with gilt chevron ornament, also of Mediterranean origin.|$|R

Weracoba Park, also known as Lakebottom Park, is the oldest, large-scale, daily use recreation facility and public greenspace within the city. It began in 1890 as a private park with a shallow lake, dance pavilion, <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>bowling</b> alley <b>and</b> zoo; in 1924, the city purchased the park, {{a part of it}} became the site of Columbus High School, Lakebottom Park’s lake was drained and the remainder became officially Weracoba Park, taking its new name from the creek that winds through it.

50|$|Many mummies {{from the}} Chibcha-speaking {{indigenous}} {{groups have been}} found to date, mainly from the Muisca, Lache and Guane. In 1602 the early Spanish colonisers found 150 mummies in a cave near Suesca, that were organised in a scenic circular shape with the mummy of the cacique in the centre of the scene. The mummies were surrounded by cloths and pots. In 2007 the mummy of a baby was discovered in a cave near Gámeza, Boyacá, together with <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>bowl,</b> <b>a</b> pacifier <b>and</b> cotton cloths. The process of mummification continued into the colonial period. The youngest mummies have been dated to second half of the 18th century.|$|R

5000|$|The Cowan Bridge school {{imposed a}} uniform on the {{children}} known as the Charity children, which humiliated the Brontës, who were among {{the youngest of the}} boarders. They suffered taunting from the older children, Charlotte especially, who owing to her short sightedness had to hold her nose to the paper {{to be able to read}} or write. They slept two in a bed with their heads propped up, rising before dawn, making their morning ablutions in a basin of cold water (shared with six other pupils) which had often frozen during the night for lack of any heating. They descended for an hour and a half of prayers before breakfasting on porridge, frequently burnt. [...] This is similar to Jane Eyre, where they get both burnt porridge and frozen water. They began their lessons at half past nine, ending at noon, followed by recreation in the garden until dinner, a meal taken very early. Lessons began again without pause until 5 p.m. When there was a short break for half a slice of bread <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>bowl</b> of coffee <b>and</b> 30 minutes recreation, followed by another long period of study. The day ended with a glass of water, an oatcake, and evening prayers before bed. Punishments included privation of food and recreation, corporal punishment, and humiliations such as being made to sit on a stool for hours on end without moving, wearing a dunce's cap.|$|R

50|$|One of Pemalang typical foods is Grombyang rice. The name of {{this food}} is quite unique. It is called Grombyang rice because {{the portion of the}} {{dressing}} is more than the rice and its side dishes so that when it is served in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>bowl</b> it sounds grombyang-grombyang or wobbling like going to spill.
