5000|$|Contrary to the Ninth Circuit's ruling, the Court did {{not believe}} that the <b>ancillary</b> <b>restraints</b> {{doctrine}} applied because the challenged business practice involved the [...] "core activity" [...] of the joint venture - the pricing of the goods it produced and sold. Even if the doctrine applied, pricing was certainly integral to a business that produced and sold goods.|$|E
5000|$|The Ninth Circuit reversed, {{ruling that}} the per se rule against price fixing instead applied, which {{conclusively}} presumed that the arrangement was illegal. [...] The Ninth Circuit reached that decision by applying the <b>ancillary</b> <b>restraints</b> doctrine, which provided an exception from the rule of reason whenever a restraint on trade was not ancillary to {{the main purpose of}} an agreement. The court did not believe the oil companies had explained why the unified pricing for their two brands of gasoline was necessary to further the legitimate goals of the joint venture, and so reversed summary judgment. Texaco and Shell both petitioned for certiorari to the Supreme Court, which consolidated the petitions and granted certiorari {{to determine the extent to}} which the per se rule against price fixing applies to joint ventures.|$|E
50|$|The plaintiffs {{argued that}} the minimum-fee {{schedule}} created an artificial price floor for title searches in Fairfax County and that, {{in the absence of}} this fee schedule, they {{would have been able to}} procure a quote lower than the one listed in the schedule. They pointed to the history of Section 1, Sherman Act enforcement. In Addyston Pipe and Steel Company v. United States, 85 F. 271 (6th Cir. 1898), Judge Taft created the distinction between naked and <b>ancillary</b> <b>restraints</b> of trade, and the Virginia State Bar's restraints are naked. In United States v. Trenton Potteries, 273 U.S. 392 (1927), the Supreme Court first established per se illegality of price-fixing because a reasonable price today may become unreasonable tomorrow and the courts cannot be expected to re-confirm every price. The reasonableness of the fees on the minimum-fee schedule is, then, immaterial. And finally, in United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co, Inc., 310 U.S. 150 (1940), the Court proclaimed, in a famous footnote, that price-fixing need be neither intentional or feasible to be found per se illegal. Hence, the fact that the State Bar's power of compulsion was not absolute does not mean the fee schedule is legal.|$|E
40|$|Commentary in {{both the}} US and the EU has {{repeatedly}} debated whether, and when, it is more efficient to use “rules” or “standards” to determine the legality of conduct subject to the antitrust laws and how such rules or standards should be formulated. This paper concentrates principally {{on the question of}} how this debate impacts on the analyticalframework for identifying infringing agreements in the US and EU. It sets out the view that the question of how agreements are to be analysed under both the US and the EU jurisprudence is unduly opaque. Confusion as to, in particular, the role and scope of per se rules, the role and scope of <b>ancillary</b> <b>restraint</b> doctrines, and how competing anti- and procompetitive effects of mixed agreements are to be balanced against each other have led to excessive complexity in the system. The paper considers what factors might shape development of a coherent and optimal framework for antitrust analysis in a jurisdiction. Once these factors have been set out, it examines how US and EU competition law have approached the issues identified in relation to the analysis of agreements and what features of each system have moulded the developments there. It concludes that both systems require some development to create more intelligible frameworks for antitrust analysis of agreements based on common concepts rather than historical categories of antitrust analysis and, further, that competition agencies could play an important part as catalysts in this progress...|$|R

5000|$|That Philips and Sony {{agreed not}} to compete {{with one another in}} respect of their joint venture was a {{reasonable}} <b>restraint</b> <b>ancillary</b> to the venture. In any case, the court continued, there was no anticompetitive effect, because [...] "even if there was such an agreement, it did not have the effect of suppressing potentially viable technology that could have competed with the Orange Book standards." [...] That was true because [...] ""there has been no showing that the Lagadec '565 patent competes with another patent in the pool, no showing that the pool licensors would have competed in the technology licensing market absent the pooling arrangement." [...] Princo did not show [...] "that the Lagadec approach is a commercially viable technological alternative to the technology of Raaymakers patents." [...] The Lagadec approach was lacking in both technical feasibility and commercial potential. [...] "Princo had the burden of showing that the hypothesized agreement had an actual adverse effect on competition in the relevant market." [...] That meant that [...] "Princo had to demonstrate was that there was a reasonable probability that the Lagadec technology, if available for licensing, would have matured into a competitive force in the storage technology market." [...] It did not meet that burden.|$|R

40|$|Professors Goldberg vigorously {{attacks the}} merits of the Three Tenors {{decision}} while emphasizing the issue of whether the challenged restraint resides within the boundaries of the firm. Professor Muris responds that the Commissions analysis is correct {{as a matter of law}} and fact, and that Professor Goldbergs call for a market power screen for all horizontal restraints ignores the legal costs of rulemaking. I take a third view of the debate. While conceding that per se rule is properly applied to naked restraints, I show that the Commissions analysis relies on an inappropriately narrow view of the <b>ancillary</b> <b>restraints</b> doctrine in order to justify application of the per se rule. In particular, the Commissions emphasis on the timing of the restraint as well as its hostility towards PolyGrams free rider defense are not supported as a matter of law. In any event, the facts of the Three Tenors do not support the Commissions conclusion that the moratorium agreement was not ancillary to the joint venture. ...|$|E
40|$|This Note {{examines}} the Pronuptia {{decision for the}} legal definition and substantial support it gives to the franchising concept. 14 When compared to the Court 2 ̆ 7 s prior decision in Etablissements Consten SARL and Grundig-Verkaufs-GmbH v. Commission, 5 Pronuptia is seen to promote a more liberal interpretation of the EEC Treaty 2 ̆ 7 s competition article, Article 85. However, Pronuptia falls short of the advances made in Nungesser KG v. Commission, 16 because some territorial restraints allowed under Article 85 (1) in that case were not permitted in Pronuptia. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s approach in Pronuptia to the doctrine of <b>ancillary</b> <b>restraints</b> is also discussed. Use of this doctrine is a step forward in a 2 ̆ 2 rule of reason 2 ̆ 2 analysis in which the Court may be engaged in the future. 2 ̆ 77 Reactions to the case from the Commission and the international franchise community are reported. 2 ̆ 7 8 Finally, the Note evaluates the Pronuptia decision {{in light of the}} economic goals that it has advanced, and the legal certainty that it has given to the burgeoning economic force of franchising...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis is to analyse two issues {{arising out of}} the European and Czech {{competition}} law provisions prohibiting agreements which restrict competition. First, I shall examine the issue of distinction between prohibited agreements and allowed unilateral conduct. Furthermore, I shall explore {{the definition of the}} concerted practice as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union and Czech administrative courts focusing again on the distinction between such practice and unilateral conduct. Second, I shall elaborate on the structure of Article 101 TFEU. As a consequence of the "more economic approach" taken by the Commission and the repeal of the individual exemption system under Article 101 (3) TFEU, the distinction between the concept of object offences and the concept of effect offences is slowly disappearing while having detrimental implications for legal certainty. Moreover, the conceptual distinction between considerations of <b>ancillary</b> <b>restraints</b> under Article 101 (1) TFEU and consideration of pro-competitive and anti-competitive effects under Article 101 (3) TFEU is slowly disappearing as well. The economics take their role in the assessment, and that is also the reason why I chose this topic because I am interested in the overlap between law and economics. My thesis is [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper examines, from an {{antitrust}} perspective, {{the recent}} controversy of the Google Book Search (GBS) settlement in its broader context of copyright collective administration. It argues that courts should view competitive {{concerns of the}} settlement pertaining to exclusivity and pricing as <b>ancillary</b> <b>restraints</b> to an overall procompetitive copyright collective, and hence courts should analyze the settlement using the rule of reason instead of condemning it as per se illegal under antitrust law. In particular, I will examine closely the following five issues: (1) How does the GBS settlement relate to ASCAP/BMI blanket licensing in the music performance context and copyright collective arrangements in general? (2) Why should courts apply the rule of reason (as opposed to a per-se illegal rule) to analyze anticompetitive features of the GBS settlement and other copyright collectives? (3) What is the proper antitrust baseline against which a rule-of-reason analysis is conducted? More precisely, should an antitrust court ask whether a collective scheme is overall efficiency-enhancing or should look it for a “less restrictive alternative” which is equally capable of achieving procompetitive goals, albeit in a less anticompetitive manner? (4) How should a court identify and weigh anticompetitive justifications and procompetitive objectives of an ancillary restraint? How can a “reverse” rule of reason be adopted to help courts and parties to identify efficiency modifications to an existing collective arrangement? (5) What would be the result if the rule-of-reason analysis is applied {{in the specific context}} of the GBS settlement in evaluating the competitive effects of allegedly anticompetitive restraints and proposed modifications...|$|E
40|$|In the American Needle {{case the}} Supreme Court will {{consider}} whether the NFL’s decision {{to give an}} exclusive trademark license to one firm should be counted as “unilateral” on the NFL’s part, or rather as the concerted joint venture activity of the NFL’s individual member teams. The intellectual property in question is not trademarks in the NFL itself, but rather the trademarks and other intellectual property developed separately by each individual team, and which the teams in turn have licensed exclusively to the NFL. In general, when a joint venture is engaged in its own business the unilateral characterization is appropriate. Thus, for example, if the ABA decides to hold its convention in San Francisco rather than Chicago that decision should not ordinarily {{be treated as a}} “conspiracy” of the ABA’s members to boycott Chicago. By the same token, the NFL has many employees of its own, and labor disputes between those employees and the NFL would be considered as involving a single employer. By contrast, when disputes involving the players of individual teams are at issue the NFL is properly treated as a collaboration of employers, as the Supreme Court assumed to be the case in its Brown vs. Pro Football decision in 1996. A decision that the NFL is a joint venture of multiple firms when it is managing the separable business interests of the member teams need not result in per se illegality or, for that matter, not even in particularly harsh treatment. Output limiting restrictions by legitimate joint ventures are dealt with under the <b>ancillary</b> <b>restraints</b> doctrine and tested for reasonableness. The great majority of such restraints are reasonable and lawful. By contrast, even efficient joint ventures can become vehicles for the naked restraints of their members...|$|E
40|$|Unilateral refusals {{to license}} {{intellectual}} property rights are almost never antitrust violations, as is true of most unilateral refusals to deal. Concerted refusals to deal are treated more harshly under the antitrust laws because they can facilitate collusion or, {{in the case of}} technology, keep superior products or processes off the market. In its en banc Princo decision a divided Federal Circuit debated whether Congress had protected concerted refusals to license from claims of patent misuse. The majority rejected the dissent’s argument that Congress had no such intent and then went on to hold that an alleged concerted refusal to license was not misuse. This conclusion is troublesome because in its Independent Ink decision the Supreme Court virtually equated the scope of antitrust liability with the scope of misuse as defined by § 271 (d). Broad legality for concerted refusals to license patents, and unused patents in particular, has serious implications for competition and innovation. A concerted refusal to license a factory or other productive asset can facilitate collusion by denying resources to rivals unless they can find alternative sources of supply. A concerted refusal to license an unused patent can go much further. Not only does it deny rivals that particular technology but it also prevents them from developing any technology independently that would infringe one or more of that patent’s claims. Of course, not every concerted refusal to license should be unlawful per se. In antitrust, they are appropriately covered by the <b>ancillary</b> <b>restraints</b> doctrine. Naked agreements not to license are unlawful per se, while refusals reasonably necessary to further joint research or production would be unlawful only if market power and anticompetitive effects were proven. By contrast, reading § 271 (d) of the Patent Act to authorize all concerted refusals is likely to harm both competition and the incentive to innovate...|$|E
