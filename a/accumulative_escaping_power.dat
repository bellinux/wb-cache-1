40|$|We have {{developed}} a microscope system for real-time single sperm tracking with an automated laser tweezers <b>escape</b> <b>power</b> assay. Phase contrast images of swimming sperm are digitized to the computer at video rate. The custom algorithm creates a region of interest centered about a sperm {{in response to a}} mouse click and performs all subsequent tasks autonomously. Microscope stage movement responds to feedback from video analysis of swimming sperm to center the sperm with respect to the field of view. For <b>escape</b> <b>power</b> assays, sperm are automatically relocated to the laser trap focus where they are held for a user-defined duration at fixed power, or held as laser power is gradually reduced. The sperm's position is automatically monitored to measure the laser power at which the sperm escapes the trap. Sperm are tracked for extended durations before and after laser trap experiments. Motility measurements including the curvilinear velocity and the absolute position of the sperm relative to the cell chamber are calculated and written to the hard drive at video rate. Experimental throughput is increased over 30 times compared to off-line data analysis. The efficacy of the "track and trap" algorithm is validated through examples and comparisons with the manually collected data. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

40|$|Negative {{electron}} affinity (NEA) property {{means that the}} vacuum level {{is lower than the}} conduction band minimum in the bulk. For GaN photocathode, the effective {{electron affinity}} of the material is smaller than zero. According to Spicer “ 3 -step model”, the photoemission mechanism for varied GaN photocathode was studied. For the varied doping GaN photocathode, the photoelectrons can be transported to the surface by diffusing and drifting in the directional inside electric field, and the higher photoemission performance can be obtained. By covering with low <b>escape</b> <b>power</b> materials such as Cs or O on an atomically clean surface, Negative electron affinity property can be achieved for the varied doping GaN photocathode. Using the activation and evaluation system for NEA photocathode, the varied doping GaN photocathode was activated with Cs and O, and the photocurrent curve for varied doping GaN photocathode was gotten...|$|R

Going beyond lamentation at the horrors of biopolitical domination, the book develops a positive-critique of biopolitical experience: offering explanations as to the enormous appeal of biopolitical discourse; and cultivating an affirmative, ethical and productive response to the technologies of biopolitical racism and securitization. Such a response is not about life <b>escaping</b> <b>power</b> or a retreat from life, but rather involves critical work on the conditions of production of population life (becoming collective). In addition to a detailed account of Foucault's writings on biopolitics, biology and experience the book offers a critique of some key contemporary interpretations of Foucault and develops the positive-critique of biopolitical experience by exploring the place of biopolitics, racism and contingency in feminist politics...|$|R

30|$|It can {{therefore}} be concluded that, {{like the rest of}} humanitarianism, the field of campaigning for the rights of COTM, is inherently paternalistic. It is based on a body of knowledge constructed over the course of this century and sustained by moral and expert authority, and it uses these to justify the act of imposition of Western-based principles {{in the name of the}} best interests of the child. However, the purpose of this research was not to provide a value-laden judgement on the case study. Within the Foucauldian conceptual framework informing this analysis, no truth <b>escapes</b> <b>power</b> (Taylor 1984). It is therefore not in the interest of this study to judge whether the paternalistic nature of the rights of COTM should be condemned or exalted. Its conclusions, however, cannot but lead us to embark on a process of dispelling the myth of a humanitarianism based solely in the world of ethics. Ethics, in the light of this research, are both powerful and subjective.|$|R
50|$|The Grass Dancer often {{describes}} a Yuwipi ceremony where tribe members gather together {{to call on}} the spirits for answers. An example of this ceremony happens in chapter 3 when Archie Iron Necklace has a dream about a medicine hole. During the Yuwipi ceremony, the spirits of Sioux ancestors guide the tribe members on a vision where Archie Iron Necklace, Herod Small War, Frank Pipe, and Harley Wind Soldier appear as young Sioux Indians riding their horses on the plain in the year 1877. On this day, {{one year after the}} Custer battle, four young warriors were trapped in the valley by white soldiers out for revenge. They prevented the warriors from escaping the valley, forcing their horses to die of starvation. When the soldiers discovered the corpses of the horses, the young warriors seemed to have vanished. The Yuwipi vision revealed how the four warriors managed to escape. The earth opened a hole and the four men were able to <b>escape.</b> (<b>Power</b> 85).|$|R

Powers and Kensington are placed in a death trap by Dr. Evil, but they easily escape, and Kensington is sent for help. While searching for Dr. Evil, Powers is confronted by the fembots, whom he defeats by counter-seducing them with a striptease. Led by Kensington, British forces raid the underground lair, while Powers finds the doomsday device and deactivates it. Powers confronts Dr. Evil, but Fagina arrives holding Kensington hostage. They are interrupted by Number 2, who attempts to betray Dr. Evil by making a deal with Powers. Dr. Evil uses a trap door to eliminate Number 2, then activates the base’s self-destruct mechanism and <b>escapes.</b> <b>Powers</b> and Kensington flee just as a nuclear explosion destroys the lair.|$|R

40|$|Diploma thesis "Escape of persecuted Jews from Vienna in 1942. Interpretative {{analysis}} o f a diary" {{deals with}} an escape {{of a man}} and a woman across the Alps to Italy. The research aimed at studying two levels of the problem, the phenomenon of refuge as such, and a diary as an autobiographical resource, and provides its analysis. Considering the variety of the environments in which the escape happened, the author had to examine all possibilities to access the resources, and also the methods o f verification. Thus archive documents were used alongside with printed resources and artifacts. The diary is to be regarded as a resource, which first of all, records the event as such, and also as a document, which reflects the writer's experience. The commentary through interpretation presents not only the so far unknown route of an illegal passage of Austro-Italian border, but also discusses the relationship of the refugees, a man and a woman, in extreme conditions. Consequently it is shown that the term "emigration" is too complex and general to be used precisely, especially in case of an illegal <b>escape.</b> <b>Powered</b> by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R
40|$|The {{political}} {{revival of}} the anti-war movement after 9 / 11 launched a controversial debate on global resistance against war. Liberal cosmopolitans characterise the movement as a consensual force of opposition against war {{in the form of}} global civil society acting on thebasis of ‘universal’ values. Radical poststructuralists consider it a preliminary example of the Multitude, waging ‘a war against war’ as a global body of opposition. For statecentrics, these views are utopian in referring to global struggles and political subjects that do not yet exist, and alarming because global resistance <b>escapes</b> <b>power</b> in the ‘postpolitical’ struggle. Here, the theoretical debate is critically analysed from the perspective of ‘critical theory in political practice’. Through an empirical case study of four organisations within the new anti-war movement in Britain, it is demonstrated that these theories’ connection to practice is inadequate, and in many ways problematic due to theirtendency to resort to a dualistic ‘either-or’ logic. The paper introduces a ‘both-and’ approach that not only reflects more accurately {{the way in which the}} relationship between global and local is conceived within the movement but also provides a more comprehensive perspective for conceptualising power in the context of social movements generally...|$|R

This platform consists of two separate but related microscopy systems, Robolase I and Robolase IV. Specifically, this platform allows for the following. 1. Custom microfluidic chambers {{can be used to}} manipulate sperm and egg independently with automated computer controlled flow rates and valve timings (Robolase I or Robolase IV; Chapters 4 - 7). 2. Optical scissors can be used to damage individual organelles within an oocyte, egg, or embryo (Robolase IV; Chapter 7). 3. Individual motile sperm can be tracked in real-time (Robolase I; Chapters 2 - 3, 5 - 6). 4. While being tracked, velocity measurements are automatically calculated and saved (Robolase I; Chapters 2 - 3, 5 - 6).
