50|$|<b>Acecarbromal</b> (INN) (brand names Sedamyl, Abasin, Carbased, Paxarel, Sedacetyl, {{numerous}} others), {{also known}} as acetylcarbromal and acetyladalin, is a hypnotic and sedative drug of the ureide (acylurea) group discovered by Bayer in 1917 that was formerly marketed in the United States and Europe. It is also used in combination with extract of quebracho and vitamin E {{as a treatment for}} erectile dysfunction under the brand name Afrodor in Europe. <b>Acecarbromal</b> is structurally related to the barbiturates, which are basically cyclized ureas. Prolonged use is not recommended as it can cause bromine poisoning.|$|E
50|$|Bromoureides are sedative-hypnotics {{available}} {{mainly in}} Europe, including <b>acecarbromal,</b> bromisoval, and carbromal (Horowitz, 1997). They are a subfamily of the ureides (acylureas). Carbromal was {{banned in the}} European Union in 1967 {{after the death of}} The Beatles manager Brian Epstein.|$|E
50|$|The acylurea {{functional}} group {{is also found}} in some pharmaceutical drugs such as the anticonvulsants phenacemide, pheneturide, chlorphenacemide, and acetylpheneturide (which are phenylureides), and the sedatives <b>acecarbromal,</b> bromisoval, and carbromal (which are bromoureides). Others include apronal (apronalide), capuride, and ectylurea. As the barbiturates are basically cyclic ureas, these drugs are structurally and mechanistically related to them. The phenylureides are also closely related to the hydantoins, such as phenytoin, and may be considered ring-opened analogues of them.|$|E
