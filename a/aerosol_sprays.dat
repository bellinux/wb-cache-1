40|$|Abstract. The bioefficacy of Piper aduncum L. {{essential}} oil formulated in aerosol cans was evaluated against Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus in a simulated room. The <b>aerosol</b> <b>spray</b> test {{was based on}} the Malaysian test standard for aerosol (MS 1221 : 1991 UDC 632. 982. 2 modified from WHO 2009 methodology) and examined the knockdown effect within 20 minutes of exposure. Mortality rate after 24 hour of holding period was also determined. A commercial <b>aerosol</b> <b>spray</b> (0. 09 % prallethrin 0. 05 % d-phenothrin) was also tested as a comparison. Our results showed that the knockdown effect of the commercial <b>aerosol</b> <b>spray</b> and P. aduncum {{essential oil}} spray (8 % and 10 % concentrations) was significantly higher in Ae. albopictus adult females, when compared with that of Ae. aegypti adult females (P< 0. 05). There was a significant difference in knockdown between commercial <b>aerosol</b> <b>spray</b> and essential oil spray for both Aedes spp. (P< 0. 05). The essential oil induced significantly higher mortality in Ae. aegypti (80 %) than in Ae. albopictus (71. 6 %) (P< 0. 05). The commercial <b>aerosol</b> <b>spray</b> caused 97. 7 % and 86. 5 % mortality against Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus respectively (P< 0. 05). Based on these data, P. aduncum essential oil {{has the potential to be}} used as an <b>aerosol</b> <b>spray</b> against Aedes spp...|$|R

25|$|Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) - {{harmful to}} the ozone layer; emitted from {{products}} are currently banned from use. These are gases which are released from air conditioners, refrigerators, <b>aerosol</b> <b>sprays,</b> etc. On release into the air, CFCs rise to the stratosphere. Here they {{come in contact with}} other gases and damage the ozone layer. This allows harmful ultraviolet rays to reach the earth's surface.

40|$|Abstract: Background. Adequate {{humidification}} of {{inspired gas}} with active or passive humidifiers {{is a standard}} of care for tracheotomized patients. In this study, a comparison is made between the tracheal climate after tracheobronchial humidifica-tion either with molecular water (via a vaporizing humidifier) or particulate water (via spray) in spontaneously breathing tracheo-tomized patients. Methods. We performed a randomized, 2 -way crossover study on 10 tracheotomized patients. Tracheal humidity and temperature were measured prior to and after use of a vaporiz-ing humidifier and <b>aerosol</b> <b>spray,</b> respectively. Results. After use of both the vaporizing humidifier and the <b>aerosol</b> <b>spray,</b> the end-inspiratory total water content and water gradient in the upper trachea increased significantly, compared with baseline values before application. After end of use of the vaporizing humidifier, the total water content and the water gra-dient decreased significantly faster than after application of the <b>aerosol</b> <b>spray.</b> Conclusions. Delivery of both molecular and particulate water significantly increases the tracheal climate and condition-ing in the tracheal airways. Because the tracheal humidity remained on a higher level after <b>aerosol</b> <b>spray,</b> we speculate that particulate water may be efficient on tracheal humidification for longer. However, the positive effect on tracheal humidity after prolonged application of the <b>aerosol</b> <b>spray</b> remains to be pro...|$|R
2500|$|Dupont, {{along with}} Frigidaire and General Motors, {{was a part}} of a {{collaborative}} effort to find a replacement for toxic refrigerants in the 1920s, resulting in the invention of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by Thomas Midgley in 1928. CFCs are ozone-depleting chemicals that were used primarily in <b>aerosol</b> <b>sprays</b> and refrigerants.
