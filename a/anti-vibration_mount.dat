40|$|The High Static Low Dynamic Stiffness (HSLDS) {{concept is}} a design {{strategy}} for a nonlinear <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>mount</b> {{that seeks to}} increase isolation by lowering the natural frequency of the mount whilst maintaining the same static load bearing capacity. It has previously been proposed that an HSLDS mount could be implemented by connecting linear springs in parallel with the transverse flexure of a composite bistable plate — a plate that has two stable shapes between which it may snap. Using a bistable plate in this way will lead to lightweight and efficient designs of HSLDS mounts. This paper experimentally demonstrates the feasibility of this idea. Firstly, the quasi-static force–displacement curve of a mounted bistable plate is determined experimentally. Then the dynamic response of a nonlinear mass–spring system incorporating this plate is measured. Excellent agreement is obtained when compared to theoretical predictions {{based on the measured}} force–displacement curve, and the system shows a greater isolation region and a lower peak response to base excitation than the equivalent linear system...|$|E
40|$|The high static low dynamic {{stiffness}} (HSLDS) concept is a design strategy for an <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>mount</b> {{that seeks to}} increase isolation by lowering the natural frequency of the mount, whilst maintaining the same static load bearing capacity. Previous studies have successfully analysed many features of the response by modelling the concept as a Duffing oscillator. This study extends the previous findings by characterising the HSLDS model in terms of two simple parameters. A fifth-order polynomial model allows us to explore {{the effects of these}} parameters. We analyse the steady-state response, showing that simple changes to the shape of the force displacement curve can have large effects on the amplitude and frequency of peak response, and can even lead to unbounded response at certain levels of excitation. Harmonics of the fundamental response are also analysed, and it is shown that they are unlikely to pose significant design limitations. Predictions compare well to simulation results...|$|E

40|$|LectureLecture 6 : Typical {{floating}} production, {{storage and}} offloading (FPSO) compression applications are presented, including drivers and auxiliary equipment, and typical compressor operating conditions. Base packages consisting of centrifugal compressor(s), gear, motor or gas turbine driver, lube oil tank, and auxiliary equipment require extensive analyses to validate design requirements for service on FPSO vessels. Finite element analyses (FEA) are performed {{to insure that}} stress and displacement criteria are met. This paper discusses loading conditions that are evaluated including package lifting, transportation loads, short circuit torque, and upset loads. Operating load cases are also analyzed, which include dead weight, FPSO motion, rotor unbalance, torque, nozzle, and wind loads. Modal analyses are performed to ensure that predominant package modes do not lie in the run speed range. Rotor unbalance forced response analyses can be performed to ensure that amplitudes at key locations remain within allowable vibration criteria. Typical FEA models and analytical procedures are presented. The use of the analytical results to assist in selecting design modifications is discussed. The paper {{emphasizes the importance of}} gathering information early in the design cycle. This includes ship structural stiffness at the <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>mount</b> (AVM) locations, AVM stiffness, and load specifications including wind, wave, upset, and transport loading, and coupling capability. Finally, the paper presents a design change that allows for significant footprint reduction of the overall package...|$|E
50|$|A {{stressed}} member {{engine is}} a vehicle engine {{used as an}} active structural element of the chassis to transmit forces and torques, rather than being passively contained by the chassis with <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>mounts.</b> Automotive engineers use the method for weight reduction and mass centralization in vehicles. Applications are found in several vehicles where mass reduction is critical for performance reasons, usually after several iterations of conventional frame/chassis designs have been employed.|$|R
5000|$|The Álvaro de Bazán-class frigates are {{the first}} modern vessels of the Spanish Navy to {{incorporate}} ballistic resistant steel in the hull, along with the power plants being <b>mounted</b> on <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>mounts</b> to reduce noise and make them less detectable by submarines. The original contract for four ships was worth €1,683m but they ended up costing €1,810m. [...] {{it was estimated that}} the final vessel, F-105 would cost €834m (~US$1.1bn).|$|R
40|$|Portable power {{generators}} are used very commonly in shops, offices and homes today {{in order to}} supply power during power shutdowns. These generators emit very high levels of noise, in addition to noxious air emissions. Exposure to noise causes detrimental effects on neuro-endocrine, cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive systems. Chronic exposure to noise causes fatigue and interferes with concentration, thus reducing work efficiency. Experimental studies on the assessment and control of indoor and near-field noise levels due to the operation of a portable power generator were undertaken at the Centre for Environmental Studies (CES), Anna University. Noise control was studied employing <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>mounts</b> (made up of rubber, coir, polyurethane foam, thermocole, wool–felt and sand bed) and enclosures (made up of cardboard, thermocole and a sandwich of cardboard and thermocole). The sand beds of 32 mm thickness (containing sand particle size 0. 5 mm) with an air gap of 5 cm between sandwich enclosure walls, among <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>mounts</b> and enclosures, respectively, {{were found to be}} most effective in controlling noise due to the generator operation...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} design of a novel <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>{{mounting}}.</b> The mounting {{takes the form of a}} triangular truss which is ‘folded’ such that each section extends in the opposite direction to the previous section. The geometry of this complex, compact structure is optimised to exploit the reflections that occur in vibrational waves travelling through the structure to provide significant levels of vibration isolation. In this study we have achieved a 15 dB reduction in vibration energy compared to a baseline regular structure...|$|R
40|$|Isolating a {{piece of}} {{delicate}} equipment from the vibration of a base structure is of practical importance {{in a number of}} engineering fields. Examples are the isolation of instrument boxes in aeroplane and the isolation of telescopes and antennas in satellites. In the majority of cases, the base is flexible and vibrates with an upredictable waveform which has a broadband spectrum. The active isolation of a vibration-sensitive equipment structure from a vibrating base is studied in this paper. Passive <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>mounts</b> are widely used to support the equipment and protect it from severe base vibration. However, conventional passive mounts suffer from an inherent trade-off between high frequency isolation and amplification of vibration at the fundamental mounted resonance frequency. General the best isolation performance is achieved by using an active system in combination with a passive mount, where the fundamental resonance can be actively controlled without reducing the high frequency performance...|$|R
40|$|Vibration {{isolation}} of aerospace structures that support high precision instrumentations demand a novel design approach. In {{order to create}} a design that is suitable for use in harsh environments with no risk of drift in alignment of the structure, the commonly used viscoelastic elements should ideally be eliminated. The novel isolator proposed here is a space-frame structure that is folded in on itself to act as a mechanical filter over a defined frequency range. The design uses a genetic algorithm based geometric optimisation routine to maximise passive vibration isolation hybridised with a geometric feasibility search. To complement the passive isolation, an active system is incorporated in the design which in effect adds damping to the system. The active-passive structure is shown to achieve transmissibility of about 19 dB over a range of 1 - 250 Hz. The design has no or little consequent weight and cost penalties whilst maintaining its effectiveness with the vibration levels. The results indicate the promise of a new breed of <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>mounting</b> design...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} develop new fire retardant rubber formulations, by surveying the existing knowledge base for fire retardant approaches for polyisoprene rubber, characterising unmodified compounds, formulating and studying fire retarded compounds for use within suspension and <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>mounting</b> systems. Materials have been prepared on a bench scale and evaluated for physical properties. Thermal decomposition has been studied using Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) in both air and nitrogen. Burning behaviour has been studied using a horizontal burning rate method, Limiting Oxygen Index (LOI) and the cone calorimeter. Basic rubber mixtures were prepared to investigate the interactions between the polymer and additives, under TGA conditions. Zinc oxide {{was found to have}} little effect on the polymer decomposition, while silica reduced thermal stability. When decomposed in air, increasing levels of carbon black reduce the rate of mass loss in the polymer. Comparing formulations with different cross-linking types, sulphur without cross-linking increases the heat release in a cone calorimeter; but when low levels of sulphur form efficient cross-links, heat release is suppressed, as also occurs with organic peroxide cross-linking. The effect of carbon black on burning behaviour was compared with inorganic fillers. Within the cone calorimeter, material containing carbon black formed a char-like residue which provides some reduction in the rate heat release, and did not contribute to the fuel load. The use of inorganic fillers yielded more rapid burning behaviour. Any level of carbon black addition gives a reduction in the rates of heat, smoke, CO, and CO 2 release, confirming that carbon black had a stabilising effect. Intumescent formulations were prepared using ammonium polyphosphate (APP), pentaerythritol and melamine, and separately using expandable graphite (EG). Within the cone calorimeter both systems yielded a significant reduction in the first peak of heat release rate, but a much higher second peak than for the unmodified compound. This second peak value is associated with the significant levels of intumescence observed. The use of EG gave a greater level of fire retardance compared to the APP formulation. Hydrated fillers, and blends thereof, were investigated; an equal blend of aluminium hydroxide (ATH) and magnesium hydroxide (MH) was found to yield the lowest peak release rate on the cone calorimeter. Hydrated fillers were investigated with synergists proposed in the literature. Little benefit was noted for these additives when used as partial replacements for the filler...|$|R
50|$|The initial {{proposal}} for the system was to simply mount the towed launcher, (less its running gear) and its petrol generator set on the flat bed of the M548 (diesel-powered) carrier. When this was shown to Mr G.R. Jefferson, the GW Managing Director, he was not very impressed and because he knew how much money was available he required a much more extensive change. The design engineers at Filton took this opportunity {{with both hands and}} under the guidance and control of Greville Beale and Adrian Pollicutt and without the restrictions that a government funded project imposed, a very significant new arrangement was produced in quite a short period. This included significant changes to the M548 vehicle to armour the vehicle, now designated RCM 748 and to incorporate an all new diesel powered generator set using the Coventry Climax H 30 engine (as used as the auxillary power unit in the Chieftain tank). The majority of the electronic equipment in the launcher was not changed significantly from that used in the towed version. However a completely redesigned armoured launcher with the capability of loading eight missiles was produced which was <b>mounted</b> via <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>mounts</b> to the flat bed of the vehicle. The armoured cab was provided with pan-climatic heating/cooling and NBC protection. The optical tracker was placed inside the armoured cab of the vehicle, elevating through the roof for operation. The tracker was operated from {{the right side of the}} crew cabin, while on the left were the driver and tactical controller who was also provided with a helmet-mounted sight, allowing him to lay on the tracker to a visual target. From moving to firing took only 30 seconds, a tremendous improvement over Towed Rapier, which required at least 15 minutes to unlimber, cable-up and align. A further difference between Towed and Tracked Rapier was that the Tracked Rapier launcher had eight (protected)missile rails compared with the four of the towed system, enhancing firepower and reducing re-supply requirements. It was also air-portable, ready to deploy on landing, in C130 aircraft. There was no room for Blindfire on a single RCM748 vehicle, so this was instead towed or was to be carried on a separate modified M548/RCM748. Feeding data to the control system in the firing unit again required setup time to connect the two equipments.|$|R
5000|$|Of the British {{manufacturers}} themselves, Triumph motorcycles, {{built at}} Meriden, {{were used by}} many British (including the Metropolitan Police) and Commonwealth police forces until 1983 when the factory closed. From the late 1940s, Triumph was also, for a time, {{the choice of the}} Parisian police, a fact promoted in a factory-produced movie, It's A Triumph !. The police version of the 650cc 6T Triumph Thunderbird was nicknamed the SAINT, an acronym of [...] "Stops Anything In No Time". By the mid-1970s, with industrial problems and closures affecting their spares supply and service, Triumphs and other British marques were increasingly replaced by the smoother BMW R80 (and to a more limited extent, Norton Interpols) than by then-current Triumph police bikes. In an attempt to win back orders from BMW, Meriden marketed Triumph Bonneville and Tiger models of 750cc size with anti-vibration mountings as well as electric starting but these still only achieved limited sales success. In 1981, the UK newspaper, Motor Cycle News, reported Derbyshire's Chief Constable comparing these Triumphs very unfavorably to BMW, in particular, its <b>anti-vibration</b> engine <b>mounts.</b> Supported by an article in rival publication, Motor Cycle Weekly, this criticism was strongly refuted by the factory and Derbyshire eventually accepted evaluation of police versions of the new Triumph T140W TSS in anti-vibration mounts.Norton's Commando Interpol [...] and later Wankel rotary engine Interpol 2 motorcycle were used by some British forces until that firm's collapse in the early 1990s. Other marques such as BSA were used by some forces although only the Velocette LE 'noddy-bike' model proved as popular with the police as the Triumphs.|$|R
