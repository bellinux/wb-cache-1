In this case, the supply line becomes an [...] "island" [...] with power surrounded by a [...] "sea" [...] of unpowered lines. For this reason, solar inverters that are designed to supply power to the grid are generally required to have automatic anti-islanding circuitry in them. In intentional islanding, the <b>generator</b> <b>disconnects</b> from the grid, and forces the distributed generator to power the local circuit.

40|$|Differential {{protection}} {{is a popular}} method to protect <b>aircraft</b> <b>generators</b> against winding faults. Traditional relay-based systems have a limited capability to distinguish between differential current resulting from a winding fault, and the one resulting from measurement noise or current saturation, resulting in false alarms and unnecessary equipment shutdown. Modern <b>aircraft</b> <b>generators</b> are monitored and controlled by advanced generator control units, and therefore, sophisticated signal processing algorithms can be implemented to enhance the differential protection performance. We propose and compare four different differential detector designs, based on the available information about measured currents, for detection of persistent, short circuit faults in the protected windings. Also, current sensors are subject to intermittent, open circuit, cable faults, resulting in degradation in the differential detection performance. We propose an optimal differential protection architecture, based on the Neyman-Pearson criterion, to detect winding short circuit faults {{in the presence of}} intermittent cable faults. In this architecture, the system switches between two different detectors, depending on the cable health state. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Integrated Drive Generators (IDGs) are {{the main}} source of {{electrical}} power for a number of critical systems in aircraft. Fast and accurate fault detection and isolation is a necessary component for safe and reliable operation of the IDG and the aircraft. IDGs are complex systems, and a majority of the existing fault detection and isolation techniques are based on signal analysis and heuristic methods derived from experience. Model-based fault diagnosis techniques are hypothesized to be more general and powerful in designing detection and isolation schemes, but building sufficiently accurate models of complex IDGs is a difficult task. dq 0 models have been developed for design and control of generators, but these models are not suitable for fault situations, where the generator may become unbalanced. In this paper, we present a hybrid phase-domain model for the <b>aircraft</b> <b>generator</b> that accurately represents both nominal and parametric faulty behaviors. We present the details of the hybrid modeling approach and simulation results of nominal operation and fault behaviors associated with parametric faults in the <b>aircraft</b> <b>generator.</b> The simulation results show that the developed model is capable of accurately capturing the generator dynamics under a variety of normal and faulty configurations.

40|$|A {{methodology}} for investigating {{the reduction of}} community noise impact is reported. This report {{is concerned with the}} development of two models to provide data: a guidance <b>generator</b> and an <b>aircraft</b> control <b>generator</b> suitable for various current and advanced types of <b>aircraft.</b> The guidance <b>generator</b> produces the commanded path information from inputs chosen by an operator from a graphic scope display of a land-use map of the terminal area. The guidance generator also produces smoothing at the junctions of straight-line paths. The <b>aircraft</b> control <b>generator</b> determines the optimal set of the available controls such that the aircraft will follow the commanded path. The solutions for the control functions are given and shown to be dependent on the class of aircraft to be considered, that is, whether the thrust vector is rotatable and whether the thrust vector affects the aerodynamic forces. For the class of aircraft possessing a rotatable thrust vector, the solution is redundant; this redundancy is removed by the additional condition that the noise inpact be minimized.

50|$|In 1986, Pete Planchon {{conducted}} {{a demonstration of}} the inherent safety of the Integral Fast Reactor. Safety interlocks were turned off. Coolant circulation was turned off. Core temperature rose from the usual 1000 degrees Fahrenheit to 1430 degrees within 20 seconds. The boiling temperature of the sodium coolant is 1621 degrees. Within seven minutes the reactor had shut itself down without action from the operators, without valves, pumps, computers, auxiliary power, or any moving parts. The temperature was below the operating temperature. The reactor was not damaged. The operators were not injured. There was no release of radioactive material. The reactor was restarted with coolant circulation but the steam <b>generator</b> <b>disconnected.</b> The same scenario recurred. Three weeks later, the operators at Chernobyl repeated the latter experiment, ironically in a rush to complete a safety test, using a very different reactor, with tragic consequences.

50|$|As a result, {{the input}} current of such basic {{switched}} mode power supplies has high harmonic content and relatively low power factor. This creates extra load on utility lines, increases heating of building wiring, the utility transformers, and standard AC electric motors, and may cause stability problems in some {{applications such as}} in emergency <b>generator</b> systems or <b>aircraft</b> <b>generators.</b> Harmonics can be removed by filtering, but the filters are expensive. Unlike displacement power factor created by linear inductive or capacitive loads, this distortion cannot be corrected by addition of a single linear component.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of a substantial reduction of weight and size of electrical generators is the main incentive behind the effort to develop superconducting armature windings based on coated conductors {{in the form of}} wide tapes with large aspect ratio. The main obstacle to the application of coated superconductors in stator windings is the large losses incurred due to the ac magnetic field produced by the rotor's dc coils of the field windings. In the range of frequencies typical for <b>aircraft</b> <b>generators,</b> the hysteretic losses in wide tapes are unacceptably high. They can be reduced by dividing the superconducting layer into multiple filaments separated by non-superconducting barriers. However, the lack of current sharing between the filaments makes the conductor vulnerable to the localized defects, so that a single blockage can impede the flow of transport current through the whole length of a given filament. We present estimates of reliability as well as the magnetization losses in multiply connected superconductors. In this type of superconducting tape, a sparse network of superconducting bridges, which allows for current sharing, connects the filaments. The trade-off between the different types of losses and the connectivity requirement imposes restrictions on the number of filaments and properties of the network of bridges.

40|$|Faults {{in medium}} and high voltage grids lead to voltage sags {{in the low}} voltage level. Due to the voltage dip, {{distributed}} <b>generators</b> <b>disconnect</b> from the low voltage grid. Depending {{on the amount of}} disconnected generation, system stability could be compromised. With a dynamic grid support, distributed generators remain connected to the grid during faults, also called fault ride-through. Moreover, the feed in of reactive power supports the voltage during the fault. According to the present state of the art, no requirements exist for a dynamic grid support in low voltage grids. However, with a high penetration of distributed generation these requirements might change in the future. This paper investigates the dynamic grid support in low voltage grids. The impact of a dynamic grid support on a distribution grid is studied with IEEE/CIGRE benchmark models for low and medium voltage grids. Models of inverters, directly-coupled synchronous and induction generators are implemented. Furthermore, a present and a future protection system with fault ride-through capability are added to the grid models. The inverters are equipped with a reactive current controller to give a voltage support during faults. To determine the effect of a dynamic grid support, faults in high and medium voltage grids with and without dynamic grid support are simulated and evaluated. The results have shown that the effect of the voltage boost through dynamic grid support in order to recover the voltage is marginal. However, with a high penetration level of distributed generators the voltage boost increases and the impact of faults can be further limited. This investigation has demonstrated the potential of dynamic grid support in low voltage grids to avoid the loss of a large amount of power and to improve the voltage recovery...|$|R
