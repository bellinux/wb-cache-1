40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to understand and identify prison male inmates who had <b>attempted</b> suicide in their history prior to their incarceration. The objectives were (1) the comparison of inmates who had indicated that they had <b>attempted</b> suicide in their past, referred to as 2 ̆ 2 suicide <b>attempt</b> inmates, 2 ̆ 2 with inmates who had not, referred to as 2 ̆ 2 non-suicide <b>attempt</b> inmates, 2 ̆ 2 on 33 behavioral and personal variables; (2) The development of a suicide <b>attempt</b> scale by means of an item analysis on the responses of suicide <b>attempt</b> and non-suicide inmates to the items of the Bipolar Psychological Inventory (BPI). This scale was named the BPI Suicide <b>Attempt</b> Scale; (3) The development of a comp o site suicide <b>attempt</b> scale; the components selected for this scale would be the BPI Suicide <b>Attempt</b> Scale, and/or {{one or more of the}} 33 personal and behavioral variables. This scale w 9 s named the Criminal Suicide <b>Attempt</b> Scale. Based on an original and a replication sample of suicide <b>attempt</b> inmates and non-suicide <b>attempt</b> inmates at the Utah State Prison, with those in the original sample being younger, the findings were: (1) of the 33 personal and behavioral variables only one of them, prior drug use, differentiated each of the two groups within each of the two samples; several other different ones of them differentiated each of the two groups within each of the two samples; (2) BPI Suicide <b>Attempt</b> Scale, derived from the Bipolar Psychological Inventory which the inmates at the prison take usually soon after their incarceration, and developed on the two groups of the original sample, was able to differentiate the two groups of the replication sample at the. 001 level; (3) The Criminal Suicide <b>Attempt</b> Scale, which consisted of two weighted components, drug use variable and the BPI Suicide <b>Attempt</b> Scale, correlated. 38 with the suicide <b>attempt</b> vs. non-suicide <b>attempt</b> inmates of the replication sample and it was shown to have moderate accuracy in identifying suicide <b>attempt</b> inmates. In an <b>attempt</b> to further validate the developed BPI Suicide <b>Attempt</b> Scale, a supplementary study was included in this dissertation. It concerned the use of this scale on male inmates at the Utah State Prison who had <b>attempted</b> suicide at the prison, referred to as 2 ̆ 2 prison suicide attempters. 2 ̆ 2 It compared their scores on this scale with those of the two groups of the replication sample, and related their scores on the scales of the Bipolar Psychological Inventory (BPI) and a risk rating. The findings were (1) derived from their BPI, the scores on the BPI Suicide <b>Attempt</b> Scale of the prison suicide attempters and of the non-suicide <b>attempt</b> inmates differed significantly at the. 02 level. The mean score of the prison suicide attempters was essentially the same as that of the suicide <b>attempt</b> inmates of the replication sample; (2) the BPI Suicide <b>Attempt</b> Scale scores of the prison suicide attempters correlated positively and significantly with their scores on 8 scales of the BPI. Six of these scales, depression, self-degradation, impulsiveness, psychic pain, family discord and dependence are related to factors indicated in the literature of suicidology to be associated with suicidal individuals; (3) the BPI Suicide <b>Attempt</b> Scale scores of the prison suicide attempters did not correlate with their risk factors scores on the risk-rescue rating of Weisman and Worden (1974) ...|$|R
