25|$|Aurora {{straddles}} Interstate 70, Interstate 225 and the E-470 beltway. The Regional Transportation District's {{light rail}} transit system was extended to serve the southwestern edge of Aurora on November 17, 2006. The H Line stops at Aurora's Dayton and Nine Mile Stations; a comprehensive network of feeder buses in southern Aurora serve the latter. An extension of light rail along I-225 through the city is planned to connect with a commuter rail line between downtown Denver and Denver International Airport (DIA), both scheduled for completion by 2017 (see FasTracks). Much of Aurora is more convenient to DIA than Denver itself. This proximity {{is a factor in}} the expected growth of the E-470 corridor directly south of DIA, projected to eventually accommodate 250,000 additional Aurora residents. On February 24, 2017, the Regional Transportation District opened the R-Line that runs from the Lincoln Station in Lone Tree south of Denver, to Peoria Station in NE Denver, where riders may board the A line providing service from Union Station in downtown Denver with several stops to Denver International Airport. The R Line makes multiple stops through the core of the central district of the City. Currently, a single day pass can pay the fare for any of the District's buses, light-rail or commuter-rail modes of transportation. So a single pass can be used to ride <b>a</b> <b>bus</b> <b>to</b> a light-rail station that connects to commuter-rail, like the A Line to the Airport.|$|E
