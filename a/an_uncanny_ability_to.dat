Both were Oxford men who knew the system inside out, and the close collaboration with which they worked was a function of their shared background and worldview. Cannan was known for terrifying silences, and Milford had <b>an</b> <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability,</b> testified <b>to</b> by Amen House employees, to 'disappear' in a room rather like a Cheshire cat, from which obscurity he would suddenly address his subordinates and make them jump.

Indeed, Frowde knew within a few weeks of Milford's entering the London office in 1904 that he would be replaced. Milford, however, always treated Frowde with courtesy, and Frowde remained in an advisory capacity till 1913. Milford rapidly teamed up with J. E. Hodder Williams of Hodder and Stoughton, setting up what was known as the Joint Account for the issue {{of a wide range of}} books in education, science, medicine and also fiction. Milford began putting in practice a number of initiatives, including the foundations of most of the Press's global branches.|$|R

Interviewing exclusively is not good enough; for every question the interviewers asks there is a book out there which tells the job seeker how the question can best be answered. There are dozens of books on how to impress the interviewer which even include pat answers. These days you can not even pick up a magazine without running across an article about “How to play the inter-viewing game and win”.

Marvin Knorr expresses a sympathetic view of Rommel's attitude to the General Staff, saying that their attitudes towards officers of middle class like him made it understandable that he was wary about them, and worried that the officers they sent to him would report on him or try to take over. Despite this, he came to trust and depend on these staff officers, like Friedrich von Mellenthin and Siegfried Westphal, who in turn proved their talent and loyalty. Rick Atkinson acknowledges Rommel's [...] "audacity, tactical brilliance, and personal style", also noting that he [...] "had <b>an</b> <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> dominate the minds of his adversaries".|$|E

2500|$|Charlotte {{was officially}} {{designated}} as Princess Royal on 22 June 1789. After {{the birth of}} three sons in a row, her parents were delighted to have a Princess in the nursery. Like all of her siblings, Charlotte was inoculated—in her case, in December 1768 along with her brother William. As the eldest daughter of the monarch, Charlotte {{was assumed to be}} destined for an important marriage on the continent, and her education was considered to be of the utmost importance, beginning when she was only eighteen months old. Since French was the official language in every European court, the little Princess was given a Frenchwoman to be her tutor, in order that she should have no accent. Her memory was another of her beginning subjects. She was taught to recite little verses and stories, and as a result had <b>an</b> almost <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> recall detail {{for the rest of her}} life. Her early childhood was not all scholarly pursuits. When she was almost three years old, she took place in her first tableau dressed like Columbine, where she danced with her seven-year-old brother George, Prince of Wales. She was not a naturally musical child and later abhorred such displays of children, declaring that they made children vain and self-important. This did not stop her parents from continuing to show her off. In late 1769, she and the Prince of Wales were once again displayed, this time to the public in a [...] "junior drawing room" [...] in St. James' Palace. Charlotte was dressed in a Roman toga and lay on a sofa. Though this type of thing was common in German courts, it was considered vulgar in England, where in reaction a London mob drove a hearse into the Palace courtyard. Afterward, the Prince of Wales told Lady Mary Coke that the whole event had made Charlotte [...] "terribly tired." [...] Wisely, the King and Queen decided to never repeat the experience.|$|R
40|$|In {{relation}} to the city, the cinema may {{be regarded as a}} revelation. Cinema brings to light what used to be contained in adumbration. Cinema holds <b>an</b> almost <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> deliver exhaustive representations of composite urbanity. Cinema unmasks metropolitan monumentality. Yet, as a medium with the <b>ability</b> not only <b>to</b> capture motion but to mobilize, film also appears as a life-bringing force, exposing but also igniting what has shown to be the dormant potentials of the urban web. If before, as Walter Benjamin expressed it, "[o]ur taverns and our metropolitan streets, our offices and furnished rooms, our railroad stations and our factories appeared to have locked us up hopelessly", the filmic medium changed all this, releasing us from incarceration, "so that now, in the midst of its far-flung ruins and debris, we calmly and adventurously go travelling. " What comes through in this quote is the bio-political aspect of cinematic urbanism and the mutual dependency between film and city life. In a situation where power is no longer absolute but continuously exercised through mass-mediation, and where the distance between monitoring and mobilizing has diminished, the inter-mediality between film and urbanity has gained both in importance and in ambiguity. While cinema may transgress the representative limits of the urban order, revealing to {{each and every one of}} us a more performative than contemplative potential, it does at the same time propose new regimes, offering an adventurous, yet calm and controlled ride through life. The paper will address such life-governing aspects of cinematic urbanism and especially what could be described as its double agenda of revelation and mobilization, addressed from within the filmic medium as such through different forms of self-referentiality. On the one hand side, this referentiality has been supplemented with claims to greater authenticity and more far-reaching representativity as concerns real life. On the other hand side, it has evoked what could be seen as an anagrammatic actualization of conditioning forces, playfully recombining the basic components of both filmic and urban life. As an urban anagram, cinema presents a performative capability capricious enough as to challenge what has become the increasingly powerful bio-political aggregate of life, knowledge and subjectivity...|$|R

He played end for the undefeated 1919 Fighting Irish team that also featured another Michiganian, George Gipp. The passing combination of Gipp at left halfback to Kirk at left end became one of Notre Dame's greatest offensive weapons in 1919. In October 1919, The Fort Wayne News and Sentinel praised [...] "the ability of Kirk in receiving passes and breaking away for long runs." [...] In early November 1919, Kirk drew attention {{for his work in}} Notre Dame's win over Indiana. The Indianapolis Star praised the team's end play:"The Irish wing men are wonderful performers. Either Kirk or Anderson can snag the ball out of the air on forward passes with great skill. Both are fast and wonderful defensive men. It was seldom in Saturday's game that either was boxed. They broke up what little interference Indiana displayed and got through to their man time after time."In late November, Notre Dame defeated Purdue 33-13, and the Indiana Star reported that the Boilermakers would have finished on top {{had it not been for}} the passing attack of Gipp and Kirk. Kirk scored two touchdowns against Purdue, and the Star noted: [...] "Some of the passes completed by Gipp and Kirk were of the sensational order. Two touchdowns resulted from passes, Gipp to Kirk ..." [...] At the end of the 1919 season, the Indianapolis Sunday Star named Gipp and Kirk to its All-Indiana team, two of the four Notre Dame players to be so honored in 1919. The Star wrote of Kirk:"In every game the Irish have competed in this season, Kirk has been <b>a</b> star. His <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> camp under forward passes gives him a call on the eleven.
