40|$|The topic {{chosen for}} this project is 2 ̆ 2 The Necessity and Use of <b>Application</b> <b>in</b> the Expository Sermon. 2 ̆ 2 It is this writer 2 ̆ 7 s {{contention}} that application is the least understood, least used and most abused element of the expository sermon. Application {{is one of the}} most necessary elements in the expository sermon, yet remains one of the most overlooked and ignored features of the preaching event. This project will first establish the need for <b>application</b> <b>in</b> the expository sermon, examine methods of application and give comprehensive recommendations for using <b>application</b> <b>in</b> the expository sermon. The writer 2 ̆ 7 s intent is clear; to point out the value of <b>application</b> <b>in</b> the context of the preaching event and to discover and discern the most valuable and practical tools available to use <b>application</b> <b>in</b> the most effective manner. This project will be of valuable use to this preacher as well as all those who desire to connect the never-changing biblical truth to the ever-changing modern world. The project will begin with a clear description of <b>application</b> <b>in</b> the expository sermon. Definitions will be offered and examples will be given to clearly define the meaning of <b>application</b> <b>in</b> the expository sermon. Next, the Bible will be used to support the use of and call for <b>application</b> <b>in</b> the expository sermon. After a biblically based mandate for application, different methods of application will be studied. A broad sample of preachers from different churches, denominations, areas and levels will be studied to determine the different types of application. Finally, the writer will offer a preferred model for application and point to its value to the preacher and to the hearer...|$|R
