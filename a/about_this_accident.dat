The Politburo Standing Committee attempted to control public opinion about the disaster response, by issuing an order to both [...] "understand the sorrow of the families" [...] and [...] "concretely preserve social stability". Some foreign journalists were also blocked from the rescue site in Hubei province where a police cordon was set up with checkpoints.|$|E

6000|$|In {{consequence}} of Dobbin's victory, his character rose prodigiously in {{the estimation of}} all his schoolfellows, {{and the name of}} Figs, which had been a byword of reproach, became as respectable and popular a nickname as any other in use in the school. [...] "After all, it's not his fault that his father's a grocer," [...] George Osborne said, who, though a little chap, had a very high popularity among the Swishtail youth; and his opinion was received with great applause. It was voted low to sneer at Dobbin <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>accident</b> of birth. [...] "Old Figs" [...] grew to be a name of kindness and endearment; and the sneak of an usher jeered at him no longer.|$|E

5000|$|... 14 November 1982:T-2B Blue Impulse #4, 19-5174, crashed {{during a}} down-ward bomb-burst {{manoeuvre}} at a Hamamatsu air display, {{having failed to}} pull up in time and crashed into a building in Takaoka, Miyazaki, killing the pilot and injuring 13 people on the ground, as well as damaging 28 civilian houses and <b>about</b> 290 cars. <b>This</b> <b>accident</b> brought performances a halt {{for the remainder of}} the year.|$|R
2500|$|His next {{scheme was}} for forgeries of the mint's [...] "machine-struck" [...] coins, so he {{recruited}} Thomas Holloway {{and bought a}} house in Egham, Surrey, where the noise of coining and hot moulding machines would not be suspicious. It was also outside the legal boundary of London. Among the group was John Peers, a molten metal and moulding specialist, but on 18 May 1697 he appeared before magistrates on an unrelated charge, and denounced Chaloner's Egham operation as part of his plea. Newton heard <b>about</b> <b>this</b> by <b>accident</b> three months later so arrested Peers for questioning and then recruited him as an agent. Peers rejoined Holloway in Egham and produced 18 forged shillings, enabling Newton to arrest Holloway for coining.|$|R
60|$|The little brook {{ran along}} over its pathway of gold, here pausing {{to form a}} pool, in which minnows were darting to and fro; and then it hurried onward at a swifter pace, as if in haste to reach the lake; and, forgetting to look whither it went, it tumbled over the root of a tree, which {{stretched}} quite across its current. You would have laughed to hear how noisily it babbled <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>accident.</b> And even after it had run onward, the brook still kept talking to itself, {{as if it were}} in a maze. It was wonder-smitten, I suppose, at finding its dark dell so illuminated, and at hearing the prattle and merriment of so many children. So it stole away as quickly as it could, and hid itself in the lake.|$|E

40|$|This book {{reports on}} how regions, countries, and Europe as a {{continent}} {{responded to the}} Chernobyl accident. The responses of society to traumatic disasters which change the whole pattern of life on a continent for an extended time period are discussed. "It is highly important to talk <b>about</b> Chernobyl. <b>This</b> <b>accident</b> should not become taboo, an isolated freak occurrence that never should have happened {{and that should be}} ignored. Such social amnesia is a risky outcome of the credibility crisis. To reduce this risk, effort should be made to ask important questions: Can we realize all the implications of the accident at Chernobyl? Can we be better prepared for the next occurrence?" This scientific study is coauthored by a group of prominent scientists from several European countries, who had as their common goal a wish to give a lucid view of the status of scientifically validated knowledge on the risk responses in Europe after Chernobyl...|$|R
6000|$|In {{the chapter}} {{following}} this, {{which is called}} [...] "The Flying Authority," [...] I try in vain to locate and fix any authority that could rationally rule men in so rooted and universal a matter; little would be gained by ordinary men doing it to each other; and if ordinary practitioners did it they would very soon show, by a thousand whims and quarrels, that they were ordinary men. I then discussed the enlightened despotism of a few general professors of hygiene, and found it unworkable, for an essential reason: that while we can always get men intelligent enough to know more {{than the rest of}} us <b>about</b> <b>this</b> or that <b>accident</b> or pain or pest, we cannot count on the appearance of great cosmic philosophers; and only such men can be even supposed to know more than we do about normal conduct and common sanity. Every sort of man, in short, would shirk such a responsibility, except the worst sort of man, who would accept it.|$|R

50|$|At {{the age of}} 15 Karelin {{broke his}} leg while training; having learned <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>accident</b> his mother burned his wrestling uniform and forbade him to wrestle. Since then he broke his arms twice and ribs eight times. Around January 1988 he had a serious concussion, and doctors {{considered}} removing him from the 1988 Olympic team. Karelin won the 1993 World Championships despite breaking two ribs in the opening bout against Matt Ghaffari. At the 1996 European Championships in Budapest, he had torn the right chest muscle so badly that doctors predicted {{he would not be}} able to use his right hand for several months. Karelin won the Championships, but had to be urgently operated in Budapest. He recovered within three months to compete at the 1996 Olympics.|$|E
50|$|Rino {{had finally}} decided {{to buy a new}} Volvo 343 in {{metallic}} gray. On 2 June, at about 3 am, Rino was returning home alone in his car. At 3.55 am, while along Rome's Via Nomentana, at the intersection of Viale XXI Aprile, he was in collision with a van. The front and right side of the Volvo were destroyed. When help arrived, Rino was already in a coma and at the hospital, an x-ray showed a fracture {{at the base of the}} skull, various wounds to the forehead, a fractured right molar and a suspected fracture of the sternum. However, the clinic did not have a department for cranial injuries and the doctor on duty, Dr. Novelli, tried in vain to contact another hospital with a cranial trauma department. He contacted by phone St. John, St. Camillus, the CTO of Garbatella, the Policlinico Gemelli and San Filippo Neri, but could not get any assistance. At 6am, Rino Gaetano died. There was a great deal of controversy <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>accident,</b> because of the failure of any of the contacted hospitals to help Gaetano and thus, an investigation was launched.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare the value of {{statistical}} life (VSL) estimates for traffic, drowning, and fire accidents. Using a choice experiment in a mail survey of 5, 000 Swedish respondents we estimated the willingness to pay for risk reductions in the three accidents. In the experiment respondents were asked a series of questions, whether they would choose risk reducing investments where type of accident, cost of the investment, the risk reduction acquired, and the baseline risk varied between questions. The VSLs for fire and drowning accidents were found to be about 1 / 3 lower than that for traffic accidents. Although respondents worry more <b>about</b> traffic <b>accidents,</b> <b>this</b> alone cannot explain the difference in VSL estimates. The difference between fire and drowning accidents was not found to be statistically significant...|$|R

50|$|The story {{involves}} {{of three}} boys. They were all friends {{since they were}} little. One day, something which changed their entire life had happened. One of the boys called Morio, a six-year-old boy, fell from the swing when they were playing. He remained unconscious for about 12 years in a hospital. Morio’s friends and family tried {{to escape from the}} tragedy and forget <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>accident.</b> The other two boys, Mikihiko and Tomonari, had grown up and nearly forgot about Morio. Finally, Morio woke up and regained consciousness suddenly. However, Morio’s intelligence quotient stayed at 6 years old. Mikihiko decided to help Morio {{to catch up with the}} society. Therefore, Mikihiko had to sacrifice a lot of things in order to spend time and look after Morio, for instance, he broke up with his girlfriend Kie, quitted university and his free time etc. Nevertheless, Mikihiko failed to let Morio became accustomed to the society because Morio still had a childish and naive heart. Morio came back to the hospital and Mikihiko continued to live his own life at the end. Eventually, Mikihiko realised that everyone, even the ones who are childish as Morio could not escape from the reality of growing up and has to face the world which was ugly as sin.|$|E
40|$|Many of {{the survey}} report about vehicle {{accident}} say that, accidents are happening due to driver’s drowsiness and over speed. Drunk and driving is another factor for accidents. If these mistakes are corrected accidents can be reduced, not hundred percent but up to the satisfied level. If accidents occurred, immediate first aid and treatment is necessary to save life. So once accident happened informing it immediately to nearby hospital and ambulance service is very important. But {{if there is no}} neighbor the case may be severe. Keeping all these in mind a new idea is proposed which can perform the necessary steps to prevent accident. It can prevent the accidents and incase if accident happened system will inform the owner and ambulance <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>accident.</b> The alcohol sensor available in the proposed system alerts the owner such that “Drunk and Driving” and it will not allow engine to start. In case alcohol consumption is sensed at the time of driving, engine will slowly OFF after giving pre-warning sound. Steering wheel grip sensor is used to detect driver’s drowsiness and alert the diver not to sleep. Finally when accidents occurred, the system will automatically send a text message to ambulance service via GSM network. The system also records the parameters like speed and engine temperature in permanent storage during the time of accident. It helps to identify the reason for accidents. Temperature sensor is used to detect the engine temperature and LCD screen displays the system’s status. MEMS accelerometer is used to detect the accident, and during this accident speed is recorded in permanent memory for later referenc...|$|E
40|$|This study set out {{to provide}} a {{description}} of the children involved in fatal accidents and to ascertain which deaths might have been prevented and by what means. The records from a convenience sample of four coroners (jurisdictions of Inner North London, Birmingham, Bedfordshire, and Ipswich) of inquests opened in 1984 - 8 on children aged under 15 killed in accidents were reviewed for information on the deceased, the accident, and the injuries sustained. Altogether 225 records (150 boys, 75 girls) were examined. Accidents to pedestrians were the commonest cause of death (81 cases), and road safety engineering measures were the most likely means by which most fatalities might have been prevented. The records frequently omitted information on social circumstances, family structure, ethnic group, or the use of safety equipment. Cooperative coroners can contribute to child safety as their records are rich in information <b>about</b> <b>accidents.</b> <b>This</b> could be made available to parties interested in accident prevention, including community paediatricians...|$|R
