40|$|This article proposes an {{integrated}} management and monitoring {{system based on}} the information model for the large weapon system on the heterogeneous distributed environments. Since the large weapon system is the large scale distributed system composed of a variety of heterogeneous subsystems, {{it is very difficult to}} manage and integrate them. In order to manage and control consistently the subsystems that operate on the different platforms, a standardized method must be employed to maintain information about them. Also, when the configuration of the subsystems is changed, information <b>about</b> <b>subsystems</b> must reflect the changed configuration. This paper uses the information model to manage a large weapon system on the heterogeneous environments in a consistent manner. In addition, the methods for dynamic reconfiguration of information model are suggested to dynamically reflect the changes in the configuration of the subsystems into the integrated management and monitoring system. With these methods, we expect that the large weapon system can be managed reliably...|$|E
40|$|Compared to {{experiments}} utilizing {{humans in}} microgravity, cell-based approaches to questions <b>about</b> <b>subsystems</b> {{of the human}} system afford multiple advantages, such as crew safety {{and the ability to}} achieve statistical significance. To maximize the science return from flight samples, an optimized method was developed to recover protein from samples depleted of nucleic acid. This technique allows multiple analyses on a single cellular sample and when applied to future cellular investigations could accelerate solutions to significant biomedical barriers to human space exploration. Cell cultures grown in American Fluoroseal bags were treated with an RNA stabilizing agent (RNAlater - Ambion), which enabled both RNA and immunoreactive protein analyses. RNA was purified using an RNAqueous(registered TradeMark) kit (Ambion) and the remaining RNA free supernatant was precipitated with 5 % trichloroacetic acid. The precipitate was dissolved in SDS running buffer and tested for protein content using a bicinchoninic acid assay (1) (Sigma). Equal loads of protein were placed on SDS-PAGE gels and either stained with CyproOrange (Amersham) or transferred using Western Blotting techniques (2, 3, 4). Protein recovered from RNAlater-treated cells and stained with protein stain, was measured using Imagequant volume measurements for rectangles of equal size. BSA treated in this way gave quantitative data over the protein range used (Fig 1). Human renal cortical epithelial (HRCE) cells (5, 6, 7) grown onboard the International Space Station (ISS) during Increment 3 and in ground control cultures exhibited similar immunoreactivity profiles for antibodies to the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) (Fig 2), the beta isoform of protein kinase C (PKC) (Fig 3), and glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Fig 4). Parallel immunohistochemical studies on formalin-fixed flight and ground control cultures also showed positive immunostaining for VDR and other biomarkers (Fig 5). These results are consistent with data from additional antigenic recovery experiments performed on human Mullerian tumor cells cultured in microgravity (8) ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIntegrated {{modelling}} {{of global}} environmental change impacts faces {{the challenge that}} knowledge from the domains of Natural and Social Science must be integrated. This is complicated by often incompatible terminology {{and the fact that}} the interactions between subsystems are usually not fully understood at the start of the project. While a modular modelling approach is necessary to address these challenges, it is not sufficient. The remaining question is how the modelled system shall be cut down into modules. While no generic answer can be given to this question, communication tools can be provided to support the process of modularisation and integration. Along those lines of thought a method for building modular integrated models was developed within the EU project DINAS-COAST and applied to construct a first model, which assesses the vulnerability of the world?s coasts to climate change and sea-level-rise. The method focuses on the development of a common language and offers domain experts an intuitive interface to code their knowledge in form of modules. However, instead of rigorously defining interfaces between the subsystems at the project?s beginning, an iterative model development process is defined and tools to facilitate communication and collaboration are provided. This flexible approach has the advantage that increased understanding <b>about</b> <b>subsystem</b> interactions, gained during the project?s lifetime, can immediately be reflected in the model...|$|R

Analogously to an entanglement witness, we introduce the idea of a compatibility witness, and prove a number of properties about these objects. We show that the subsystem compatibility problem can be solved numerically and efficiently using semidefinite programming, and that the numerical results from this solution can be used to extract exact analyatic results, an idea which we use to disprove a conjecture <b>about</b> the <b>subsystem</b> problem made by Butterley et al. [Found. Phys. 36 83 (2006) ].
