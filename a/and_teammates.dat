5|$|Revere {{began the}} 2013 {{season as the}} Phillies; leadoff hitter before being moved down in the lineup {{following}} an injury. His primary strengths are his speed and his defense, while he struggles to hit for power; he has only hit seven home runs in the major leagues. Writers <b>and</b> <b>teammates</b> have described Revere as being a genuine, goofy, energetic player.|$|E

5|$|According to many observers, {{including}} Ray Ferraro <b>and</b> <b>teammates</b> Brendan Gallagher and Connor McDavid, Tanev {{was perhaps}} the best defenceman in the tournament {{in terms of his}} defensive play - he and his defence partner, Morgan Rielly, were not on the ice for a single goal against at even-strength. Tanev also played a major role on Canada’s tournament-best penalty kill that allowed just two goals against in 29 opportunities. He registered one assist during the tournament.|$|E
5|$|After the Series, Ruth <b>and</b> <b>teammates</b> Bob Meusel and Bill Piercy {{participated in}} a barnstorming tour in the Northeast. A rule then in force {{prohibited}} World Series participants from playing in exhibition games during the offseason, the purpose being to prevent Series participants from replicating the Series and undermining its value. Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis suspended the trio until May 20, 1922, and fined them their 1921 World Series checks. In August 1922, the rule was changed to allow limited barnstorming for World Series participants, with Landis's permission required.|$|E

5|$|As the {{fighting}} was seemingly coming to an end, Carmelo Anthony confronted Collins and punched him in the face, knocking him to the ground. Jared Jeffries immediately tried to attack Anthony but tripped over Marcus Camby, before being restrained by coaches <b>and</b> <b>teammates,</b> while Anthony backed up towards the Nuggets' bench. Collins also ran down the court to get at Anthony but was blocked by Nenê and Smith. All ten players on the court {{at the time of}} the incident were ejected by the officiating crew that consisted of Dick Bavetta, Violet Palmer, and Robbie Robinson.|$|E

5|$|Auriemma {{pulled off}} {{one of his biggest}} and most {{important}} early recruiting successes in 1987 when he convinced an All American from New Hampshire, Kerry Bascom, to come to UConn. Bascom had an immediate impact on the UConn program: in 1989 she won the Big East Player of the Year award as a sophomore (she also won the award in her junior and senior years) and led UConn to its first Big East regular season and Tournament title, along with its first-ever NCAA tournament appearance; the tournament ended in a first round loss. With Bascom <b>and</b> <b>teammates</b> Laura Lishness, Megan Pattyson, Wendy Davis and Debbie Baer, UConn reached the NCAA Tournament again in 1990, losing 61–59 to Clemson in the second round after a first-round bye.|$|E
5|$|Orr {{has been}} known to be {{fiercely}} loyal to former Bruin personnel <b>and</b> <b>teammates.</b> When Derek Sanderson had alcohol and prescription drug-abuse problems and wound up penniless, Orr spent his own money to ensure that Sanderson successfully completed rehab. Decades later, Orr and Sanderson went into business together managing finances for hockey players. Orr also helped out Bruins trainer John (Frosty) Forristall, his roommate during his first years with the Bruins, who had just been fired from the Tampa Bay Lightning for alcoholism in 1994. Forristall's drinking put him on bad terms with his brother John, so he returned to Boston jobless and soon afterwards was diagnosed with brain cancer. Orr took Forristall into his home for a year until he {{died at the age of}} 51. Orr was a pallbearer at his funeral.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{advanced}} to the AAFC championship in 1946, but {{a week before the}} game, Rymkus <b>and</b> <b>teammates</b> Jim Daniell and Mac Speedie were arrested and held for several hours after a confrontation with Cleveland police. The men were drinking as they waited to pick up Speedie's wife, who was coming on a plane from Utah. Daniell, who was driving the car the three men were in, honked at a police car that was blocking him, leading to an argument and the arrests. Rymkus and Speedie were charged with creating a disturbance and Daniell was charged with public intoxication. Daniell, the Browns' captain, was kicked off the team after the incident, but Rymkus and Speedie remained. The Browns {{went on to win the}} championship the following week, and Rymkus was named to a combined all-AAFC and NFL team.|$|E

5|$|The Orioles {{decided to}} put Davis at first base {{full-time}} in 2013 and worked on his defense in spring training; later, Oriole coaches <b>and</b> <b>teammates</b> believed this helped Davis succeed at the plate as well. He set a personal home run goal before the season but refused to share it. On April 5, Davis set a new Major League record with 16 RBI {{in the first four}} games of a season. He also became the fourth MLB player in history to hit a home run in the first four games of the season (Nelson Cruz, Mark McGwire, Willie Mays), including a grand slam against Tyler Robertson in the fourth game, a 95 victory over the Minnesota Twins.|$|E
5|$|The {{euphoria}} {{of securing}} the Ashes preceded Australia's heaviest defeat. At The Oval, England amassed {{a world record}} of 7/903 and their opening batsman Len Hutton scored an individual world record, by making 364. In an attempt to relieve the burden on his bowlers, Bradman took a rare turn at bowling. During his third over, he fractured his ankle <b>and</b> <b>teammates</b> carried him from the ground. With Bradman injured and Fingleton unable to bat because of a leg muscle strain, Australia were thrashed by an innings and 579runs, which remains the largest margin in Test cricket history. Unfit to complete the tour, Bradman left the team {{in the hands of}} vice-captain Stan McCabe. At this point, Bradman felt that the burden of captaincy would prevent him from touring England again, although he did not make his doubts public.|$|E
5|$|At the 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup, Sinclair {{scored three}} goals for Canada {{on their way}} to a {{surprising}} fourth-place finish, their best in that competition to date. During the team's first group stage match against Germany, she scored the first goal of the match in the fourth minute. Germany scored four goals to defeat Canada 4–1. After defeating Argentina 3–0, the team faced Japan in their last group stage match of the tournament. With goals from Sinclair <b>and</b> <b>teammates</b> Christine Latham and Kara Lang, Canada won 3–1 and placed second in their group to advance to the knockout stage. Canada faced China in the quarterfinal match on October 2 in Portland, Oregon and won 1–0 with the lone goal scored by Charmaine Hooper in the seventh minute. Having remained winless in all previous World Cup tournaments, Canada's advancement to the semifinal was a historic change for the team. Canada was defeated by Sweden in the semifinal match 2–1 and faced the United States in the third-place match where they were defeated 3–1 and finished fourth at the tournament. Sinclair scored Canada's goal in the 38th minute.|$|E
