40|$|Hepatitis delta {{frequently}} {{leads to}} liver cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation. As treatment options are limited, {{there is a}} need for biomarkers to determine disease activity and to predict the risk of disease progression. We hypothesized that <b>anti-HDV</b> IgM could represent such a marker. Samples of 120 HDV-infected patients recruited in an international multicenter treatment trial (HIDIT- 2) were studied. <b>Anti-HDV</b> IgM testing was performed using ETI-DELTA-IGMK- 2 -assay (DiaSorin). In addition, fifty cytokines, chemokines and angiogenetic factors were measured using multiplex technology (Bio-Plex System). A second independent cohort of 78 patients was studied for the development of liver-related clinical endpoints (decompensation, HCC, liver transplantation or death; median follow up of 3. 0 years, range 0. 6 - 12). <b>Anti-HDV</b> IgM serum levels were negative in 18 (15 %), low (OD< 0. 5) in 76 (63 %), and high in 26 (22 %) patients of the HIDIT- 2 cohort. <b>Anti-HDV</b> IgM were significantly associated with histological inflammatory (p< 0. 01) and biochemical disease activity (ALT, AST p< 0. 01). HDV replication was independent from <b>anti-HDV</b> IgM, however, low HBV-DNA levels were observed in groups with higher <b>anti-HDV</b> IgM levels (p< 0. 01). While high IP- 10 (CXCL 10) levels were seen in greater groups of <b>anti-HDV</b> IgM levels, various other antiviral cytokines were negatively associated with <b>anti-HDV</b> IgM. Associations between <b>anti-HDV</b> IgM and ALT, AST, HBV-DNA were confirmed in the independent cohort. Clinical endpoints occurred in 26 <b>anti-HDV</b> IgM positive patients (39 %) but in only one <b>anti-HDV</b> IgM negative individual (9 %; p =  0. 05). Serum <b>anti-HDV</b> IgM is a robust, easy-to-apply and relatively cheap marker to determine disease activity in hepatitis delta which has prognostic implications.

40|$|Background: The role of <b>anti-HDV</b> {{immunoglobulin}} M (IgM) {{testing in}} patients receiving pegylated interferon-alpha therapy for hepatitis delta is unknown. We performed <b>anti-HDV</b> IgM testing in a well defined cohort of HDVinfected {{patients who were}} treated with pegylated interferon-alpha 2 a plus adefovir, or either drug alone. Methods: Sera from 33 HDV-RNA-positive patients from the international HIDIT- 1 trial were available for <b>anti-HDV</b> IgM testing (ETI-DELTA-IGMK- 2 assay, DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy) before therapy, at treatment weeks 24 and 48, and at 24 weeks {{after the end of}} treatment. Results: <b>Anti-HDV</b> IgM tested positive in 31 out of the 33 patients (94 %) prior to treatment. HDV IgM levels correlated with histological inflammatory activity (r= 0. 51, P< 0. 01) and were higher in patients with alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels above the median (P< 0. 05). Quantitative <b>anti-HDV</b> IgM values declined in patients responding to antiviral therapy, however <b>anti-HDV</b> IgM remained positive after treatment in the majority of virological responders. Conclusions: We suggest that <b>anti-HDV</b> IgM testing might give additional useful information to determine disease activity in hepatitis delta and to predict treatment response to antiviral therapy with type I interferons. However, determination of <b>anti-HDV</b> IgM can not substitute HDV RNA testing, which remains the primary virological marker for response to therapy...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn Taiwan, injecting {{drug use}} {{has been the}} main route of human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) transmission since 2005, with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis D virus (HDV) also having similar transmission routes. This has now become an important public health issue. The {{aim of this study}} is to explore the conditions of HDV infections between injecting drug users (IDUs) with and without HIV infection in Southern Taiwan. In this study, 87 IDUs were enrolled, including 27 <b>anti-HDV</b> seronegative IDUs and 60 <b>anti-HDV</b> seropositive IDUs, and the results of their liver function tests, CD 4 cell counts, and anti-HIV and HIV RNA levels were analyzed. The prevalence of <b>anti-HDV</b> seropositivity among hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositive IDUs in this study was 68. 9 % (60 / 87). The prevalence rate of <b>anti-HDV</b> seropositive IDUs among anti-HIV seronegative and anti-HIV seropositive cases was 40. 0 % (12 / 30) and 84. 2 % (48 / 57), respectively. Anti-HIV seropositivity was related to <b>anti-HDV</b> seropositivity (odds ratio =  9. 34, 95 % confidence interval =  2. 67 – 31. 59, p <  0. 001). Among IDUs with HIV infection, there was no significant difference in CD 4 cell counts and HIV RNA viral load between HBsAg-positive patients with <b>anti-HDV</b> seronegativity and those with <b>anti-HDV</b> seropositivity. In conclusion, the prevalence of HDV infection among IDUs is higher among IDUs with HIV infection. Because anti-HIV seropositivity is significantly related to <b>anti-HDV</b> seropositivity, HDV infection among IDUs is still important. We suggest that for IDUs, HBsAg and <b>anti-HDV</b> should be monitored closely...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—The {{effect of}} {{hepatitis}} delta virus (HDV) infection on the clinical course of cirrhosis type B is poorly defined.  AIMS—To investigate the impact of HDV status on morbidity and mortality in cirrhosis type B.  PATIENTS/METHODS—Retrospective cohort study of 200  Western European patients with compensated cirrhosis type B followed for a median period of 6. 6  years.  RESULTS—At diagnosis, 20 % of patients had antibodies to HDV (anti-HDV); median age was lower in <b>anti-HDV</b> positive cirrhotics (34  v 48  years respectively). Kaplan-Meier five year probability of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was 6,  10, and 9 % in <b>anti-HDV</b> positive/HBeAg negative, <b>anti-HDV</b> negative/HBeAg negative, and <b>anti-HDV</b> negative/HBeAg positive cirrhotics respectively; the corresponding figures for decompensation were 22,  16, and 19 % and for survival they were 92,  89, and 83 % respectively. Cox regression analysis identified age, albumin concentration, γ-globulin concentration, and HDV status as significant independent prognostic variables. After adjustment for clinical and serological differences at baseline, the risk (95 % confidence interval) for HCC, decompensation, and mortality was increased {{by a factor of}} 3. 2  (1. 0  to 10), 2. 2  (0. 8  to 5. 7), and 2. 0  (0. 7  to 5. 7) respectively in <b>anti-HDV</b> positive relative to HDV negative cirrhotic patients. The adjusted estimated five year risk for HCC was 13,  4, and 2 % for <b>anti-HDV</b> positive/HBeAg negative, <b>anti-HDV</b> negative/HBeAg negative, and <b>anti-HDV</b> negative/HBeAg positive cirrhotics respectively; the corresponding figures for decompensation were 18,  8, and 14 % and for survival 90,  95, and 93 % respectively.  CONCLUSIONS—HDV infection increases the risk for HCC threefold and for mortality twofold in patients with cirrhosis type B.    Keywords: delta hepatitis; prognosis; hepatocellular carcinoma; decompensation; surviva...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{decreasing}} {{trend in}} hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection worldwide, {{the importance of}} this disease cannot be underestimated. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate patients positive for HBsAg with respect to HDV infection and related factors. Patients with chronic hepatitis B who presented at Hamedan Province Hepatitis Community Center in 2002 - 2007 were included. A questionnaire covering demographic variables and history of hepatic disease was completed for each patient. Necessary tests were performed and antibodies to HDV were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Of 81 HBsAg positive patients, 14 (17. 3 %) contained <b>anti-HDV</b> IgG. Only one of the patients with <b>anti-HDV</b> IgM was positive for HBsAg. Of the <b>anti-HDV</b> IgG positive patients, two (14. 3 %) were women. Among the women examined in this study, 24 (35. 8 %) were <b>anti-HDV</b> IgG negative (p = 0. 21), and of these, six (42. 8 %) were HBeAg positive while 17 (25. 4 %) of the <b>anti-HDV</b> IgG negative women were positive for HBeAg (p = 0. 16). The prevalence of chronic hepatitis B among <b>anti-HDV</b> IgG positive and negative patients was 28. 6 % and 39. 2 % respectively (p = 0. 31). Because of the relatively high rate of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HDV co-infection in our study subjects, it is vital that healthcare providers and policy makers to recognize the risk factors associated with this HBV and HDV co-infection as well as the reasons for this increased <b>anti-HDV</b> serology in HBV carriers...|$|E
40|$|Objective: In this study, it {{is aimed}} to {{evaluate}} the correlationof the test results of <b>anti-HDV</b> and HDAg in patientswith chronic HBV infection and to collect data concerningHDV epidemiology. Materials and methods: <b>Anti-HDV</b> and HDAg test resultsand demographic data of the patients with chronic HBVinfection by gastroenterology and infectious diseasesin Agri State Hospital between January 2009 -May 2012 were analyzed retrospectively. HBsAg and Anti-HBc IgMtests were performed with macroelisa, <b>anti-HDV</b> andHDAg were tested with microelisa. Results: A total of 787 patients constituting 315 (40. 0 %) females and 472 (60. 0 %) males were included in thestudy. All the patients were HBsAg positive and Anti-HBcIgM negative. Of these patients, 55 (7. 0 %) cases wereonly <b>anti-HDV</b> positive; 19 (2. 4 %) were only HDAg positiveand two cases were both <b>anti-HDV</b> and HDAg positive. A total of 76 (9. 7 %) patients had positive findings ofHDV infection. The mean age of HDV-positive patientswas 42. 1 ± 15. 2 (11 - 77 years); of these 36 (47. 4) were femaleand 40 (52. 6) were male.

40|$|BackgroundHepatitis D virus (HDV) DNA vaccine {{can produce}} Th 1 and {{cytotoxic}} T-cell immune responses {{but only a}} low <b>anti-HDV</b> antibody titer is generated with a large hepatitis D antigen (L-HDAg) construct. In contrast, DNA vaccine expressing small hepatitis D antigen (S-HDAg) can generate a high titer of <b>anti-HDV</b> antibodies. Whether the low humoral immunity of L-HDAg DNA vaccine is due to inadequate dosage or can be ameliorated by other modes of immunization needs further evaluation. MethodsPlasmid (p 25 L) encoding L-HDAg and plasmid (pS/p 25 L) coexpressing hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and L-HDAg were used in this study. We compared the humoral response generated in mice using different plasmid DNA dosages and modes of immunization, including gene gun and in vivo electroporation (EP). ResultsIntramuscular injection with a high dose of plasmid DNA (10 mg/kg) produced strong antibodies to HBsAg earlier than the usual dose did, but did not augment the <b>anti-HDV</b> response. Gene gun DNA immunization could not provide a better humoral immune response to HDV. EP DNA immunization had a higher <b>anti-HDV</b> seroconversion rate of 80 %, but the <b>anti-HDV</b> antibody responses were generally weak (titer = 400 : 1). ConclusionThe low humoral immunogenicity of DNA vaccine with L-HDAg cannot be ameliorated by different dosage, gene gun immunization, or in vivo EP intramuscular injection.

A cross-sectional multicentre survey was undertaken, which enrolled 1386 HBsAg chronic carriers observed consecutively in 21 referral centres over a six-month period. The prevalence of HBeAg in patients was 11 %; the presence of HBeAg was associated independently with a younger age and coinfection with HIV. <b>Anti-HDV,</b> anti-HCV or anti-HIV antibodies were detected in 8. 1 %, 6. 5 % and 2 %, respectively. However, among the patients first diagnosed during the study period (incident cases), 14. 3 % were <b>anti-HDV</b> positive. Seven percent of the patients were immigrants; they were younger than Italian patients and 18 % were HBeAg positive; no difference was observed in the prevalence of <b>anti-HDV,</b> anti-HCV or anti-HIV antibodies.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundHepatitis delta virus (HDV) {{testing is}} {{recommended}} for all patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. HDV infection is associated with severe liver disease and interferon is the only available treatment. ObjectivesTo determine the rate of <b>anti-HDV</b> antibody testing in HBV patients; and to describe the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and management of HDV-infected patients at four hospitals in London. Study designThe <b>anti-HDV</b> testing rate was estimated by reviewing clinical and laboratory data. Cross-sectional data collection identified HDV-infected patients who had attended the study centres between 2005 and 2012. ResultsAt a centre with clinic-led <b>anti-HDV</b> testing, 40 % (67 / 168) of HBV patients were tested. Recently diagnosed HBV patients {{were more likely to}} be screened than those under long-term follow-up (62 % vs 36 %, P= 0. 01). At a centre with reflex laboratory testing, 99. 4 % (3543 / 3563) of first hepatitis B surface antigen positive samples were tested for <b>anti-HDV.</b> Across the four study centres there were 55 HDV-infected patients, of whom 50 (91 %) had immigrated to the UK and 27 (49 %) had evidence of cirrhosis. 31 patients received interferon therapy for HDV with an end of treatment virological response observed in 10 (32 %). ConclusionsThe <b>anti-HDV</b> testing rate was low in a centre with clinic-led testing, but could not be evaluated in all centres. The HDV-infected patients were of diverse ethnicity, with extensive histological evidence of liver disease and poor therapeutic responses.

40|$|Whether the {{hepatitis}} delta virus (HDV) DNA vaccine can induce <b>anti-HDV</b> antibodies {{has been}} debatable. The role of the isoprenylated motif of hepatitis delta antigens (HDAg) in the generation of immune responses following DNA-based immunization has never been studied. Plasmids p 2577 L, encoding large HDAg (L-HDAg), p 2577 S, expressing small HDAg (S-HDAg), and p 25 L- 211 S, encoding a mutant form of L-HDAg with a cysteine-to-serine mutation at codon 211, were constructed in this study. Mice were intramuscularly injected with the plasmids. The <b>anti-HDV</b> antibody titers, T-cell proliferation responses, T-helper responses, and HDV-specific, gamma interferon (IFN-γ) -producing CD 8 + T cells were analyzed. Animals immunized with p 2577 S showed a strong <b>anti-HDV</b> antibody response. Conversely, only a low titer of <b>anti-HDV</b> antibodies was detected in mice immunized with p 2577 L. Epitope mapping revealed that the <b>anti-HDV</b> antibodies generated by p 2577 L vaccination hardly reacted with epitope amino acids 174 to 194, located at the C terminus of S-HDAg. All of the HDAg-encoding plasmids could induce significant T-cell proliferation responses and generate Th 1 responses and HDV-specific, IFN-γ-producing CD 8 + T cells. In conclusion, HDAg-specific antibodies definitely exist following DNA vaccination. The magnitudes of the humoral immune responses generated by L-HDAg- and S-HDAg-encoding DNA vaccines are different. The isoprenylated motif can mask epitope amino acids 174 to 195 of HDAg but does not interfere with cellular immunity following DNA-based immunization.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the interference of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) in hepatitis B viral particle (HBsAg, HBcAg) expression in the liver of chronic HDV patients, 39 and 81 liver biopsies of HBsAg carriers seropositive for <b>anti-HDV</b> and <b>anti-HDV</b> negative controls, respectively, were studied. HBcAg was positive in 16. 7 % of the HBeAg-positive patients with HDAg in the liver and in 91, 4 % of controls. In contrast, in HBeAg- and <b>anti-HDV</b> negative patients the intrahepatic expression of HBcAg was detected in 32. 6 %. In <b>anti-HDV</b> negative patients the HBcAg liver expression correlated significantly with the HBeAg in serum (p < 0. 00001). The distribution of HBcAg was exclusively cytoplasmatic in 30 % of HDV-infected patients but mixed nuclear and cytoplasmic in 38. 3 % of the controls. The nuclear expression of HBcAg was decreased in chronic HDV infection. HBsAg was positive in 70. 3 % of patients who were <b>anti-HDV</b> positive and in 82. 3 % of controls. The membranous expression of HBsAg was detected less frequently in HDV-infected patients (p < 0. 05) than in controls, while associated with HBeAg in serum of HBV carriers without HDV superinfection (p < 0. 00001). The prevalence and the HBsAg cytoplasmic expression was not different for the chronic HDV infection or controls. Our results show: 1) decreased intrahepatic expression of HBcAg and membranous HBsAg in HBV carriers superinfected with HDV, suggesting decreased HBV replication in the liver of these patients. 2) the changing of HBcAg and HBsAg expression in the liver of HDV-infected patients, suggest {{not so much a}} decrease but rather a modulation in HBV replication.

40|$|Panels of {{hepatitis}} B virus surface antigen-positive sera from drug abusers {{were used to}} evaluate 14 commercial enzyme immunoassays from six companies for detecting hepatitis delta virus (HDV) markers. For detecting hepatitis delta virus antigen (HDAg), the Wellcome, Pasteur and Noctech assays had 100 % sensitivity for all 42 HDAg-positive serum specimens that were confirmed in-house; the Organon reagents gave 59. 5 % sensitivity without detergent and 64. 3 % sensitivity with detergent, but there were 14 discrepant results with and without detergent. The Sorin assay detected HDAg in only 10 of the positive samples (23. 8 % sensitivity). For the detection of antibody to HDV (<b>anti-HDV)</b> all six commercial enzyme immunoassays were reactive with all 36 anti-HDV-positive specimens that were confirmed in-house. There were no false-positive results with the Wellcome, Noctech, or Sorin assay, but one specimen was false positive by the Organon assay.

The mean age was 41. 9 ± 11. 3 years (range, 25 - 64 years). <b>Anti-HDV</b> antibody was positive in 8 subjects (5. 8), with a female predominance (9. 9 vs 1. 5, p= 0. 06; odds ratio, 7. 32; 95 confidence interval, 0. 87 - 61. 23). No significant relationship was seen between <b>anti-HDV</b> seropositivity and demographic factors such as age, place of residence and marital status. Conclusions: These findings show that HDV infection is endemic in Golestan province (northeast) of Iran. Seroprevalence of <b>anti-HDV</b> {{in the present study was}} higher than in some previous studies from other parts of Iran. Our results suggest that the prevalence of HBV/HDV coinfection in Golestan province of Iran has increased during the last decade. Therefore, practitioners and health care managers should be made aware of the risk of dual infection with HBV and HDV. © 2008 Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis D virus (HDV) {{infection}} occurs worldwide but {{incidence and}} prevalence data {{are limited in}} many parts of the world due to inaccurate reporting and delayed detection (1). The epidemiology of HDV infection is similar to hepatitis B virus (HBV) but with notable exceptions. Epidemiologic studies of HDV show that it is present in many different countries. It is estimated that approximately 5 % of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers are infected with HDV infection worldwide (2). The infection was endemic in the Mediterranean basin, the Middle East, and parts of Africa (1, 3 - 5). However, the rate of HDV infection has decreased in Iran due to the introduction of HBV vaccination, the subsequent decrease in HBV infection and thus in the pool of HBsAg carriers who may be infected with HDV. Socio-economic improvements and measures introduced to control the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are also responsible for this decrease. Nonetheless, it continues to represent a public health problem in some parts of the world yet (6 - 9). Although the decrease in the prevalence of HDV infection in Iran could be attributed to changes in the epidemiology of hepatitis B (10), enough evidence and data is not available to prove it. HDV is endemic in Iran but has received little attention. There is insufficient data to formally compare HDV infection rates in Iranian populations in different cities before. Fortunately, scientists have recently done epidemiological studies for determining the prevalence of HDV infection in different cities. HDV has a widespread geographic distribution with two predominant patterns of transmission. In endemic areas, such as Southern Italy, parts of Africa and South America, transmission is thought to occur through person-to-person contacts in the absence of overt percutaneous exposure. In contrast, in Western Europe and the United States, HDV infection has been confirmed to groups with frequent percutaneous exposure. There is little data available regarding the routes of HDV transmission in Iran. The predominant routes for the transmission of HBV in Iran were maternal, from infected mothers to infants and horizontal during childhood (11). The epidemiology of hepatitis B has changed in Iran and horizontal transmission in adults is increasing (10). The risk factors for acquiring HDV infection in some studies in Iran are blood transfusion, surgery, family history, Hejamat (traditional phlebotomy),tattooing, war injury, dentistry interventions and endoscopy (12, 13). There are data from different parts of the country reporting different prevalence rates. In a study by Malekzadeh et al (1989) in asymptomatic hepatitis B carriers in Shiraz (South of Iran), 13. 9 % were positive for <b>anti-HDV</b> Ab (14). This was the first report on the epidemiology of HDV infection from Iran. In a new study by Taghavi et al (2008) (15) in Shiraz in chronic hepatitis B patients over the age of 15, <b>anti-HDV</b> Ab positivity rate is 9. 7 % which shows a decrease in its prevalence. Amini et al (1989) in Hamadan (midwest of Iran) reported that 2. 4 % of HBsAg carriers were positive for <b>anti-HDV</b> Ab in Hamadan (midwest of Iran) which shows a low prevalence of HDV infection. Positive HDV cases were mainly children and young adults (< 20 years of age), suggesting that the superinfection or co-infection with HDV occurred in childhood or early adolescence (16). Rezvan et al (1986 - 1988) in a study in Tehran reported that 2. 4 % of HBsAg positive blood donors and 44. 5 % of hemodialysis patients with HBsAg had <b>anti-HDV</b> Ab (17). Karimi et al (2000) reported that 1. 3 % of HBsAg positive blood donors and 25. 2 % of hemodialysis patients with HBsAg were positive for <b>anti-HDV</b> Ab in Tehran (18). Alavian et al (2004) reported that 5. 7 % of chronic hepatitis B patients in Tehran (Capital of Iran) were <b>anti-HDV</b> positive. History of transfusion, surgical history, tattooing, war injury, dentistry interventions and endoscopy were common in HDV infection and were the risk factors (12). Roshandel et al (2007) reported that 5. 8 % of HBsAg positive individuals had <b>anti-HDV</b> Ab in Golestan (19 - 21). Hasanjani Roushan et al (2002) reported that 2 % of chronic hepatitis B patients were <b>anti-HDV</b> Ab positive in Babol (North of Iran) (22) while Zahedi et al (2003) reported that 20. 7 % of chronic hepatitis B patients were <b>anti-HDV</b> Ab positive in Kerman (South of Iran) (23). Torabi et al (2000) reported a prevalence rate of 6. 15 % for <b>anti-HDV</b> Ab positivity in chronic hepatitis B patients in Tabriz (Northwest of Iran) (24). Vaziri et al (2006 - 2007) found a prevalence rate of 31. 57 % for <b>Anti-HDV</b> positivity in HIV patients co-infected with HBV in Kermanshah (West of Iran) (25). In conclusion, HDV infection is a widespread disease that has affected a large number of HBV infected population in Iran and is considered to be a major public health problem in our country. Hemodialysis patients are at high risk for acquiring the infection and should be aware of prevention strategies for controlling hepatitis D in HBsAg positive patients (26). Heterogeneous patterns of geographic distribution of HDV infection throughout the country indicate that the risk factors of HDV infection may differ in different regions of the country and that comprehensive surveys in HBV infected patients should be conducted in the country to investigate the risk factors and the prevalence rate of infection...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{epidemiological}} {{and clinical}} determinants of {{hepatitis delta virus}} (HDV) infection in Sub-Saharan Africa are ill-defined. The prevalence of HDV infection was determined in HIV/hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infected individuals in rural Tanzania. METHODS: All hepatitis B virus (HBV) -infected adults under active follow-up in the Kilombero and Ulanga Antiretroviral Cohort (KIULARCO) were screened for <b>anti-HDV</b> antibodies. For positive samples, a second serological test and nucleic acid amplification were performed. Demographic and clinical characteristics at initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) were compared between anti-HDV-negative and positive patients. RESULTS: Among 222 HIV/HBV co-infected patients on ART, 219 (98. 6 %) had a stored serum sample available and {{were included in the}} study. Median age was 37 years, 55 % were female, 46 % had World Health Organization stage III/IV HIV disease, and the median CD 4 count was 179 cells/mul. The prevalence of <b>anti-HDV</b> positivity was 5. 0 % (95 % confidence interval 2. 8 - 8. 9 %). There was no significant predictor of <b>anti-HDV</b> positivity. HDV could not be amplified in any of the anti-HDV-positive patients and the second serological test was negative in all of them. CONCLUSIONS: No confirmed case of HDV infection was found among over 200 HIV/HBV co-infected patients in Tanzania.

40|$|Background: Hepatitis D virus (HDV) {{infection}} {{is characterized by}} rapidly progressive liver disease with adverse prognosis in most patients. Although interferon is the only approved <b>anti-HDV</b> therapy, evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of its various regimens is either old or scattered. Materials and Methods: We searched systematically Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ISI. The studies that evaluated treatment of chronic HDV infection with standard or pegylated interferon for at least 48 weeks were identified. Our inclusion criteria were positive <b>anti-HDV</b> antibody for 6 months and positive HDV-PCR {{at the start of}} study. We performed a meta-analysis for proportions using the arcsine transformation in random effects model. Sustained virological response (SVR) rate (negative Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 6 months after cessation of therapy) was the end point of interest. Results: Data were abstracted from 14 studies containing 227 chronic HDV-infected patients who received standard or pegylated interferon alpha- 2 a or - 2 b. Twenty-one and 30 patients of 71 and 156 who received standard or peginterferon, respectively, beyond 48 weeks achieved SVR. Pooled SVR rates were 29 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 19; 41] and 19 % (95 % CI 10; 29), respectively. The rates of treatment withdrawal were similar.

40|$|Ninety-three {{health care}} workers (HCW) in the Tokombere sahelian {{district}} volunteered {{to participate in a}} trial to investigate viral markers of hepatitis B, C, and D and HB vaccination status. METHODS:. Sera were tested using the Vikia HBsAg kit followed by CMIA for detection of HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, and anti-HCV. HBsAg-positive HCW were tested for HBV-DNA, <b>anti-HDV,</b> and, if positive for <b>anti-HDV,</b> HDV-RNA. RESULTS: Analysis of anti-HBc positivity indicated that 91 % of HCW had been infected by HBV, regardless of vaccination history. Vikia HBsAg results were confirmed by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) in all HCW and were positive in 17 HCW with virus load > 2000 IU/mL in 6 and HDV co-infection in 6. Anti-HCV was found in 6 HCW. Among the 55 HCW that had not been vaccinated, only 3 needed vaccination because of anti-HBc negativity. Among HCW considered for HBV treatment, one patient presenting HBV/HDV co-infection was excluded after diagnosis of hepatocarcinoma. CONCLUSION: Systematic HB vaccination of new HCW appears unnecessary in this rural region of Africa. Anti-HBc screening is cost-effective for identifying HCW requiring vaccination. Vikia HBsAg is effective for point-of-care screening. We underline the need for universal early (preferably neonatal) HB vaccination and for availability of anti-HBV drug in limited-resource countries...|$|E
