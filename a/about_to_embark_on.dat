40|$|Chemical {{signalling}} is {{the main}} mechanism by which biological function is controlled at all levels, from the single cell to the whole organism. Chemical recognition is the function of receptors, which, in addition to recognising endogenous chemical signals, are also the target of many important experimental and therapeutic drugs. Receptors, therefore, {{lie at the heart}} of pharmacology. This article describes the way in which the receptor concept originated early in the 20 th century, and evolved through a highly innovative stage of quantitative theory based on chemical kinetics, to the point where receptors were first isolated and later cloned, until we now have a virtually complete catalogue of all the receptors present in the genome. Studies on signal transduction are revealing great complexity in the events linking ligand binding to the physiological or therapeutic response. Though some simple quantitative rules of ‘receptor theory' are still useful, the current emphasis is on unravelling the pathways that link receptors to responses, and it will be some time before we know enough <b>about</b> them <b>to</b> <b>embark</b> <b>on</b> the next phase of ‘receptor theory'...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Selective {{decontamination}} of {{the digestive}} tract (SDD) is a prophylactic antibiotic regimen that is not widely used in practice. We aimed to describe the opinions of key 'stakeholders' {{about the validity of}} the existing evidence base, likely consequences of implementation, relative importance of their opinions in influencing overall practice, likely barriers to implementation and perceptions of the requirement for further research to inform the decision <b>about</b> whether <b>to</b> <b>embark</b> <b>on</b> a further large randomised controlled trial. METHODS: This was a Delphi study informed by comprehensive framework of possible determinants of health professionals' behaviour to study Critical Care practice in four countries. There were four key stakeholder participant groups including ICU physicians, pharmacists, clinical leads, and clinical microbiologists/ infectious disease physicians. Round one comprised participant interviews and Rounds two and three were online questionnaires using Delphi method. RESULTS: In this study, 141 participants were recruited of whom 82 % were retained. Participants rated themselves as knowledgeable about SDD. Antibiotic resistance was identified as the most important issue. SDD was seen as a low clinical priority but few participants reported strong opposition. There was moderate agreement that research to date has not adequately addressed concerns about antibiotic resistance and lacks generalizability. Participants indicated equipoise with regard to benefits and harms of SDD, and indicated strong support for a further randomised trial. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians have clinical equipoise about the effectiveness of SDD. Future research requires longer follow up to assess antibiotic resistance as well as greater validity/generalizability to provide definitive answers on the effectiveness of decontamination and effects on antibiotic resistance. SDD was regarded as not being a high clinical priority, which may limit future trial participation. These results have identified that a further large randomised controlled trial of SDD in critical care is both warranted and appropriate. Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|It is {{with great}} regret that I {{announce}} {{the resignation of}} our Newsletter Editor-in-Chief, Gene Wester, who has been doing an extraordinarily diligent and capable job. Over {{the last four years}} Gene has taken our newsletter from a very simple communitystyle newsletter of 8 to 12 pages to its current highly-developed stage. He has been responsible not only for editing in the traditional publishing sense, but has also been our photographer, as well as personally doing all the layout. He has continually driven newsletter content to be clear, complete, accurate, and interesting. The quality of his work has been recognized not only by newsletter readers but by the IEEE itself, who made special mention of our newsletter on their most recent 5 -year review of the Power Electronics Society. This year {{with the help of an}} Associate Editor and several Advertising Sales Representives, Gene expanded the Newsletter to 16 pages, including ads and more pages of technical content. Gene informed me a couple months ago that due to evolving priorities he would need to be replaced as soon as we could comfortably manage that. It is with very great pleasure, and a huge sense of relief, that in a surprisingly short time we have found a very talented and committed person in John Miller, an old friend of PELS – and of mine – who enthusiastically accepted the challenge to become the next Editor-in-Chief of the PELS Newsletter.

2500|$|Founded in 1137 {{following}} the Treaty of Mautern, the partially constructed Romanesque church was solemnly dedicated in 1147 to Saint Stephen {{in the presence}} of Conrad III of Germany, Bishop Otto of Freising, and other German nobles who were <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>embark</b> <b>on</b> the Second Crusade. [...] Although the first structure was completed in 1160, major reconstruction and expansion lasted until 1511, and repair and restoration projects continue to the present day. From 1230 to 1245, the initial Romanesque structure was extended westward; the present-day west wall and Romanesque towers date from this period. In 1258, however, a great fire destroyed much of the original building, and a larger replacement structure, also Romanesque in style and reusing the two towers, was constructed over the ruins of the old church and consecrated 23 April 1263. The anniversary of this second consecration is commemorated each year by a rare ringing of the Pummerin bell for three minutes in the evening.|$|E
