5|$|Building on the {{features}} of the XT, Ford Australia at one point considered not releasing the sports-oriented Falcon XR6 because of the new XR6 Turbo model. However, Ford overturned this decision before production. A specifically designed body kit distinguished the XR6 from other variants, except for the XR6 Turbo and XR8 which shared the sports bodywork. The naturally <b>aspirated</b> <b>engine</b> was identical to the engine used on the XT and Futura, and the five-speed manual transmission came as standard.|$|E

SS is an abbreviation of Super Sport, a moniker used by Chevrolet to denote high performance upgrades for the vehicle that meet certain criteria.|$|E

25|$|Turbocharger lag (turbo lag) is {{the time}} {{required}} to change power output in response to a throttle change, noticed as a hesitation or slowed throttle response when accelerating as compared to a naturally <b>aspirated</b> <b>engine.</b> This is due to the time needed for the exhaust system and turbocharger to generate the required boost which can also be referred to as spooling. Inertia, friction, and compressor load are the primary contributors to turbocharger lag. Superchargers do not suffer this problem, because the turbine is eliminated due to the compressor being directly powered by the engine.|$|E

25|$|The 2013 Ford Mustang Shelby GT350 {{is powered}} by a 5.0 liter V8 engine offered in both natural and {{supercharged}} versions. The naturally aspirated model delivers a total of 430 HP, but Shelby is also offering a new cold air package that will increase the car’s output to 450 HP. In the supercharged version, the GT350 is offered in either a Ford Racing supercharged 525 HP or a 624 HP version. The engine can be combined with a manual gearbox with a short throw shifter as standard, or an automatic transmission for the normally <b>aspirated</b> <b>engine</b> as an option.|$|E
25|$|A {{natural use}} of the turbocharger— and its {{earliest}} known use for any internal combustion engine, starting with experimental installations in the 1920s— is with aircraft engines. As an aircraft climbs to higher altitudes {{the pressure of the}} surrounding air quickly falls off. At 5,486 m (18,000ft), the air is at half the pressure of sea level and the airframe experiences only half the aerodynamic drag. However, since the charge in the cylinders is pushed in by this air pressure, the engine normally produces only half-power at full throttle at this altitude. Pilots would like {{to take advantage of the}} low drag at high altitudes to go faster, but a naturally <b>aspirated</b> <b>engine</b> does not produce enough power at the same altitude to do so.|$|E
25|$|A {{turbocharger}} remedies {{this problem}} by compressing the air back to sea-level pressures (turbo-normalizing), or even much higher (turbo-charging), {{in order to produce}} rated power at high altitude. Since the size of the turbocharger is chosen to produce a given amount of pressure at high altitude, the turbocharger is oversized for low altitude. The speed of the turbocharger is controlled by a wastegate. Early systems used a fixed wastegate, resulting in a turbocharger that functioned much like a supercharger. Later systems utilized an adjustable wastegate, controlled either manually by the pilot or by an automatic hydraulic or electric system. When the aircraft is at low altitude the wastegate is usually fully open, venting all the exhaust gases overboard. As the aircraft climbs and the air density drops, the wastegate must continuously close in small increments to maintain full power. The altitude at which the wastegate fully closes and the engine still produces full power is the critical altitude. When the aircraft climbs above the critical altitude, engine power output decreases as altitude increases, just as it would in a naturally <b>aspirated</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E

The '28' is to denote a detuned engine in the 2008 cars, compared to the 2006 model year '30' vehicles (330i and 530i) whose 3.0 naturally <b>aspirated</b> <b>engines</b> are from the same N52 family but had more output.|$|R

25|$|While some privateers {{continued}} to use GT1 version of the C6.R in Europe, the official factory team Corvette Racing switched from the slowly dying GT1 category to the much more competitive and popular GT2 class in mid-2009. The new GT2 C6.R used {{a modified version of}} the ZR1 model body, but does not have the ZR1 supercharged engine. GT2 rules are based more on production vehicles, therefore the GT2 C6.R naturally <b>aspirated</b> <b>engine</b> was considerably more restricted and less powerful than its predecessor. The car debuted at Mid-Ohio's ALMS round. They achieved one ALMS race victory in the remaining 2009 ALMS season, and one victory at the final round of 2010 ALMS season, Petit Le Mans. Corvette Racing's two GT2 C6.Rs also led most of the 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans, but both cars were forced to retire. Racing in the new GTE Pro class, the C6.R raced in the 2011 24 Hours of Le Mans with the No.73 car taking the class victory. The No.74 car led the class for most of the race but crashed in the morning hours. The C6.R raced by Larbre Competition also took the GTE Am class victory. In 2012, Corvette Racing returned to glory in the ALMS winning 4 of 10 races and claiming the Driver's, Team, and Manufacturer's Championships. Corvette Racing repeated the feat in 2013 by winning 5 of 10 races and claiming the Driver's, Team and Manufacturer's Championships again.|$|E
25|$|Yet the {{majority}} of World War II engines used superchargers, because they maintained three significant manufacturing advantages over turbochargers, which were larger, involved extra piping, and required exotic high-temperature materials in the turbine and pre-turbine section of the exhaust system. The size of the piping alone is a serious issue; American fighters Vought F4U and Republic P-47 used the same engine, but the huge barrel-like fuselage of the latter was, in part, needed to hold the piping {{to and from the}} turbocharger {{in the rear of the}} plane. Turbocharged piston engines are also subject to many of the same operating restrictions as gas turbine engines. Pilots must make smooth, slow throttle adjustments to avoid overshooting their target manifold pressure. The fuel/air mixture must often be adjusted far on the rich side of stoichiometric combustion needs to avoid pre-ignition or detonation in the engine when running at high power settings. In systems using a manually operated wastegate, the pilot must be careful not to exceed the turbocharger's maximum rpm. The additional systems and piping increase an aircraft engine's size, weight, complexity and cost. A turbocharged aircraft engine costs more to maintain than a comparable normally <b>aspirated</b> <b>engine.</b> The great majority of World War II American heavy bombers used by the USAAF, particularly the Wright R-1820 Cyclone-9 powered B-17 Flying Fortress, and Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp powered Consolidated B-24 Liberator four-engine bombers both used similar models of General Electric-designed turbochargers in service, as did the twin Allison V-1710-engined Lockheed P-38 Lightning American heavy fighter during the war years.|$|E
25|$|The 2011 Ford Mustang GT from Shelby was {{previously}} only offered {{in a white}} exterior color with Guardsman Blue Le Mans racing stripes running {{the length of the}} vehicle, but 2012 will see two new colors in Race Red with white LeMans stripes and Kona Blue with white LeMans stripes. These paint schemes are unique because they are not Factory paint jobs from Ford. The convertible will offer a new optional light bar with other options including a one-piece drive shaft and color coordinated billet aluminum engine cap set. The extensive body kit includes a revised front fascia, side rockers with brake ducts, rear bumper, and decklid. New taillights and custom Shelby GT350 badges further distinguish this special model and bring back memories of past models. The serialized dash plate with individual numbering for each GT350 produced. The 2012 Shelby GT350 will deliver the same performance numbers as the 2011 model with a 5.0L V8 delivering 430 hp normally aspirated, 525 hp supercharged, or 624 hp supercharged version. The addition of a Whipple supercharger and Borla exhaust system have really allowed this V8 to take {{on a life of its}} own. An automatic transmission is optional with the normally <b>aspirated</b> <b>engine,</b> but some will go towards the short throw shifter manual transmission because they actually enjoy to drive. Keeping the powerful engine under control will be an upgraded suspension system designed by Shelby to give the Mustang reduced body roll and more variability to create custom track setups.
