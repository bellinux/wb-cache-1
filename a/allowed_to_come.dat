5|$|Ultimately, B Company {{succeeded in}} holding their hastily {{constructed}} defensive positions {{throughout the night}} and until 05:00 on 8 October when the Chinese finally gave up. In order to preserve its remaining strength, the Chinese 191st Division was forced to pull back by , surrendering the control of Hill 217 without a fight. At first light more than 120 Chinese dead and wounded lay around the Australian defences and {{in contrast to the}} savage fighting during the night, Chinese stretcher parties were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> forward and collect their wounded under a flag of truce. The Australians had been victorious but were now exhausted after five days of heavy fighting.|$|E
5|$|A host treated his {{retainers}} {{very well}} and showered them with luxury gifts {{if he wanted to}} boast his wealth and status. One retainer even received a sword scabbard decorated with jade and pearls, while others were given items like shoes decorated with pearls. However, not all retainers shared the same status, as those showered with gifts often provided highly skilled work or greater services; retainers who were not as skilled were given lesser gifts and seated in less honorable positions when meeting the host. Regardless of status, any retainer was <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and go from his host's residence as he or she pleased, unlike a slave who was the property of his master and permanently attached to the estate. There was no official government policy {{on how to deal with}} retainers, but when they broke laws they were arrested, and when their master broke the law, sometimes the retainers were detained alongside him.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} {{conceived as a}} multiplayer-only game, where players could meet and solve new puzzles that would be added monthly. At the request of publisher Ubisoft, Cyan eventually developed a single-player portion as well. Cyan announced players would be {{invited to participate in}} a multiplayer beta test, which drew 10,000 to 40,000 participants. Uru was released in November 2003, while the multiplayer portion was delayed. Small groups of players were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> online to test the multiplayer part of the game, and journalists were told they would be invited to play soon after, but Uru Live was canceled before being released. Cyan stated that there were not enough projected subscribers to support the service.|$|E

25|$|With the {{expulsion}} of the last Portuguese in 1639, Dejima became a failed commercial post and without the annual trading with Portuguese ships from Macau, the economy of Nagasaki suffered greatly.

Kapleau had spent 13 years (1952–1965) and over 20 sesshin before being <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back and open his own center.

25|$|It {{took several}} months to clear the debris. People of all classes were forced to help; {{they were forced to}} provide wagons and horses, and some were {{recruited}} for labour. To speed reconstruction, restrictions were lifted and foreign workers were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to the city and freely work in reconstruction for a period of two years, although all workers were forbidden to demand higher wages than they had received before the bombardment. The governor ordered free entry into the city of building supplies, and the prices were to be frozen for two years. By opening Brussels to the outside commercially, the guilds' monopoly was renounced and opportunities for profiting of the disaster were reduced, in order to bring the city back to normal as quickly as possible.|$|E

In reply, only Ed Smith could do {{anything}} serious against the Surrey bowlers, with 33 off 22 balls. When Clarke dug out him, Scott Styris and Ed Joyce in quick succession, however, things looked bright for Surrey, and then rain intervened after 11 overs of the Middlesex innings. They were never <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back, and as they were 22 runs behind the par score with their 78 for 4, Surrey took the victory.|$|E

25|$|While Sinocentrism {{tends to}} be {{identified}} as a politically inspired system of international relations, in fact it possessed an important economic aspect. The Sinocentric tribute and trade system provided Northeast and Southeast Asia with a political and economic framework for international trade. Countries wishing to trade with China were required to submit to a suzerain-vassal relationship with the Chinese sovereign. After investiture (冊封) of the ruler in question, the missions were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to China to pay tribute (貢品) to the Chinese emperor. In exchange, tributary missions were presented with return bestowals (回賜). Special licences were issued to merchants accompanying these missions to carry out trade. Trade was also permitted at land frontiers and specified ports. This sinocentric trade zone was based on the use of silver as a currency with prices set by reference to Chinese prices.|$|E
25|$|East Asians, {{primarily}} ethnic Chinese and Japanese, {{can also}} be found. Europeans are represented mostly by Spanish whites but also with smaller populations of German Jews, Italians, Portuguese, British, Dutch, Danes, and Hungarians. Some converted Sephardic Jews from Spain were part of early expeditions; only Catholics were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to the New World. Later there were Jewish migrants coming from Iberia and Europe in the 1700s. Some managed to reach the Caribbean as refugees {{during and after the}} Second World War. Some Sephardic Jews reside in Sosúa while others are dispersed throughout the country. Self-identified Jews number about 3,000; other Dominicans may have some Jewish ancestry because of marriages among converted Jewish Catholics and other Dominicans since the colonial years. Some Dominicans born in the United States now reside in the Dominican Republic, creating a kind of expatriate community.|$|E
25|$|It is affectionate {{with its}} family, and gentle with the {{children}} {{and friends of the}} family. Although wary of strangers, they can accept them when it is clear that no harm is meant, but is instinctively very protective of its family, home and possessions. The Komondor is very good with other family pets, often very protective over them, but is intolerant to trespassing animals and is not a good dog for an apartment. The dog is vigilant and will rest in the daytime, {{keeping an eye on the}} surroundings, but at night is constantly moving, patrolling the place, moving up and down around the whole area. The dogs usually knock down intruders and keep them down until the owner arrives. Hungarian Komondor breeders used to say that an intruder may be allowed to enter the property guarded by a Komondor, but he will not be <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out again.|$|E

25|$|The {{home country}} {{organization}} will contact a partner {{organization in the}} country of the student’s choice. Students accepted for the program {{may or may not be}} screened by the organization in their home country. Partner organizations in the destination country each have differing levels of screening they require students to pass through before being accepted into their program. For example, students coming to the U.S. may be <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> on the recommendation of the organization in their home country, or the hosting partner may require the student to submit a detailed application, including previous school report cards, letters from teachers and administrators, and standardized English fluency exam papers. The U.S. agency may then accept or decline the applicant. Some organizations also have Rules of Participation. For example, almost all U.S. organizations cannot allow an exchange student to drive an automobile during their visit. Some organizations require a written contract that sets standards for personal behavior and grades, while others may be less rigorous. Lower cost programs can result in a student participating without a supervisor being available nearby to check on the student's well-being. Programs provided by agencies that provide compensation for representatives are more likely to retain local representatives to assist and guide the student and keep track of their well-being.|$|E
