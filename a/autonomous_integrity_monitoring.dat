The WAAS specification requires the system detect errors in the GPS or WAAS network and notify users within 6.2 seconds.

As part of NASA s Aviation Safety Program, Ohio University and NASA Langley have been involved in the research and development of real-time terrain database <b>integrity</b> <b>monitors</b> for SVS. <b>Integrity</b> <b>monitors</b> based on a consistency check with onboard sensors may be required if the inherent terrain database integrity is not sufficient for a particular operation. Sensors such as the radar altimeter and weather radar, which are available on most commercial aircraft, are currently being investigated for use in a real-time terrain database <b>integrity</b> <b>monitor.</b> This paper introduces the concept of using a Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) sensor as part of a real-time terrain database <b>integrity</b> <b>monitor.</b> A LiDAR system consists of a scanning laser ranger, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver.

50|$|One {{technology}} used to allow GPS receivers {{to continue to}} operate in the presence of some confusing signals is Receiver <b>Autonomous</b> <b>Integrity</b> <b>Monitoring</b> (RAIM). However, RAIM is predicated on the assumption {{that a majority of the}} GPS constellation is operating properly, and so it is much less useful when the entire constellation is perturbed by global influences such as geomagnetic storms.

While existing RAIM techniques, generally based on a single outlier assumption model, are adequate today {{they will not be}} justifiable {{for the next generation of}} GNSS. In this paper, a scheme for outlier identification, which uses the w-test and the associated correlation information of the test statistics to make ‘smart ’ decisions for identification of multiple outliers, is presented as an alternative to the conventional w-test. It is also proposed that, as a minimum, the conventional w-test should also implicitly include the determination of the corresponding correlation coefficients with a warning signaled to the user regarding any adjustments comprising highly correlated statistics. Detailed simulations and analyses have been performed to assess the performance of the new ‘smart ’ scheme and improved conventional procedure. Results show that the scheme is capable of detecting and isolating single and multiple outliers to comparable levels with the conventional w-test procedure with a significant reduction in the computational load. 1.
