5|$|Despite this recognition, the {{increasing}} debts of the MDHB meant {{that by the}} 1960s the company was eager {{to get rid of}} the Albert Dock. Having considered demolishing the buildings and redeveloping the land, the MDHB soon entered negotiations to sell the land to Oldham Estates, a property developer owned by Harry Hyams. Many plans for the site were developed including one that envisioned the development of a mini city that would provide 10m sq feet of letting space, hotels, restaurants, bars and underground parking in the drained dock basin. With the council reluctant to allow such a grandiose development to occur and with the huge public opposition to it (inspired at least in part by the work of Quentin Hughes), Oldham Estates were forced into scaling-down the plan and so in 1970 returned with <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>vision</b> known as 'Aquarius City', which had as its centrepiece a 44-storey skyscraper. Once again the plan failed to develop and no sooner had it been announced, than the MDHB's financial problems reached crisis point, Oldham Estates withdrew their deposit and the whole scheme fell through.|$|E

He passed on the business to his son, Ranchod Lal, who ran a one-man operation. Eventually, Ranchod Lal's sons, Ramchandra and Lakshman, inherited the business and they were instrumental in giving a new direction to the company. The duo imparted <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>vision</b> to the venture and infused a spirit of calculated risk-taking into the firm. As a result, by the 1970s, the Vadilal Company had already evolved into a modern corporate entity.|$|E

25|$|Gradually, liberal intellectuals crafted <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>vision</b> for {{achieving}} {{economic and social}} justice. The liberalism of the early 1960s contained no hint of radicalism, little disposition to revive new deal era crusades against concentrated economic power, and no intention to redistribute wealth or restructure existing institutions. Internationally it was strongly anti-Communist. It aimed to defend the free world, to encourage economic growth at home, {{and to ensure that}} the resulting plenty was fairly distributed. Their agenda-much influenced by Keynesian economic theory-envisioned massive public expenditure that would speed economic growth, thus providing the public resources to fund larger welfare, housing, health, and educational programs.|$|E
25|$|In 1903, Wieser {{was awarded}} a chair at his alma mater, the University of Vienna, as a full professor, where he taught a new {{generation}} of outstanding economists, including Ludwig von Mises, Joseph Alois Schumpeter, and his most faithful disciple, Friedrich August von Hayek. He developed a monetary theory inspired by the research of Carl Menger, and he applied himself during the following years to the problems of the quantity theory of money. In his last 25 years he dedicated himself to sociology, which he believed must go hand-in-hand with economics for the fullest understanding of human society. By combining these disciplines he was able to forge <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>vision</b> of economic policy.|$|E

500|$|Lindsay Anderson commented {{after the}} Cannes {{screening}} that Pather Panchali had [...] "the quality of ultimate unforgettable experience". In subsequent years, critics have given positive reviews. A 1958 review in Time described Pather Panchali as [...] "perhaps the finest piece of filmed folklore since Robert Flaherty's Nanook of the North". In her 1982 book 5001 Nights at the Movies, Pauline Kael wrote, [...] "Beautiful, sometimes funny, {{and full of}} love, it brought <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>vision</b> of India to the screen". Basil Wright considered it [...] "a new and incontrovertible work of art". James Berardinelli wrote in 1996 that the film [...] "touches the souls and minds of viewers, transcending cultural and linguistic barriers". In 2006 Philip French of The Observer called it [...] "one of the greatest pictures ever made". [...] Twenty years {{after the release of}} Pather Panchali, Akira Kurosawa summarised the effect of the film as overwhelming and lauded its ability [...] "to stir up deep passions".|$|E
500|$|William {{introduced}} Fanny to climbing {{after their}} marriage, {{and together they}} spent many summers in the White Mountains in New Hampshire; here she summited Mount Washington (...) several times. Climbing in the Northeastern United States allowed Fanny to develop her abilities together with other women. Unlike European clubs, American climbing clubs in the White Mountains allowed women members and encouraged women to climb. They promoted <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>vision</b> of the American woman, one who was both domestic and athletic, and Workman took to this image with enthusiasm. By 1886, women sometimes outnumbered men on hiking expeditions in New England. In her paper on the gender dynamics of climbing in the region, Jenny Ernie-Steighner states that this formative experience shaped Workman's commitment to women's rights, pointing out that [...] "no other well-known international mountaineers of the time, male or female, spoke as openly and fervently about women's rights". However, both of the Workmans disliked the provincial nature of life in Worcester, where they resided, and yearned to live in Europe. After both Fanny's and William's fathers died, leaving them enormous estates, the couple embarked on their first major European trip, a tour of Scandinavia and Germany.|$|E

500|$|In 2010, the Sesame Workshop and the Arab Bureau of Education for the Gulf States (ABEGS), which {{recognized}} [...] "the deep {{love for}} the program" [...] felt throughout the Arab world, started talks about relaunching Iftah Ya Simsim. [...] Pre-production research and preparation, like the process it took to bring the American version and the original Arab co-production, took two years. The ABEGS and the Sesame Workshop signed an agreement {{to bring it back}} to Arab television, with content suitable {{for a new generation of}} children. The show was the first educational initiative sponsored by the Mubadala Development Company, the investment vehicle of the Abu Dhabi government. The initiative sought to relaunch the old series [...] "with <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>vision</b> and content suitable for children of today". Abdel-Mohsen Al Bannai, CEO of the joint production program for GCC-JPPI and who produced other co-productions in the region during the 1980s, considered Iftah Ya Simsim as more than a TV show, but as an educational initiative. The production company Bidaya Media was chosen to produce the show; in 2013, the company was housed at Twofour54, the United Arab Emirates version of public television. The show was supported by organizations all over the world; Feras Al-Maddah, Iftah Ya Simsim's representative at the GCC, stated, [...] "It is a public/private sector partnership and we will need the support of all to extend the communication channels and continue producing more educational products".|$|E
