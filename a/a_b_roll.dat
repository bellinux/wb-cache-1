Although both rolls could vote for all 65 seats, A roll votes were given higher weighting for the 50 constituency seats, and B roll votes higher weighting for the 15 district seats.|$|E
5000|$|The album {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from most music critics. The Los Angeles Daily News gave the album <b>a</b> <b>B.</b> <b>Rolling</b> Stone reviewer Cary Carling panned the album, writing [...] "With its images of gun-toting bluster, mushrooming genitals and rampant drug use - backed by thuddingly dull beats - Smoke Some Kill should be played for every prospective rapper so he'll know {{what not to}} do." [...] Allmusic reviewer Ron Wynn called the album [...] "more chaotic than creative". In his consumer guide for The Village Voice, critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B- rating, calling Schoolly D [...] "the white audience's paranoid-to-masochistic fantasy of a B-boy" [...] and commending him for [...] "realizing the fantasy so scarily, and for commanding his own tough-guy sound".|$|R

For example, very specific types {{are used in}} negative cutting while making <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> <b>rolls</b> for printing. [...] "Painted leader" [...] is perforated film in overall colors, usually white, black, red, blue, or green. These are used for protective head and tail leaders to keep {{the body of the}} program material from being damaged. [...] "Fill leader" [...] (also called picture fill, or spacer, or slug film) is used to space out different sections of magnetic audio film stock so they are kept in synchronization with the picture. Typically, this is made from rejected or retired prints of previously released programs.|$|R
2500|$|The 1969 Constitution {{modified}} the detailed provision for electoral rolls and {{seats in the}} Assembly. The most significant 1969 modifications were that cross voting was abolished and the <b>B</b> <b>roll</b> was reserved for non-Europeans. The Assembly constituencies were reformed so that there were 50 <b>A</b> <b>roll,</b> and 8 <b>B</b> <b>roll</b> seats. It was provided {{that the number of}} <b>B</b> <b>roll</b> seats would rise over time in line with the proportion of total personal income tax paid by blacks until a total of 50 black seats was reached. In addition to the <b>B</b> <b>roll</b> seats, the African tribal chiefs were able to elect another 8 members. The immediate result of this arrangement was that 270,000 whites had 50 seats and 6 million Africans had 8 seats in the Assembly, with a handful of African chiefs having 8 seats as well. These reforms served only to reinforce black rejection of the system.|$|R

2500|$|Some non-militant black {{groups and}} {{individuals}} contested and won <b>B</b> <b>roll</b> seats (often under the title [...] "ANC Independent"). Under the 1969 constitution, the <b>B</b> <b>roll</b> was reserved exclusively for non-Europeans. This black political grouping {{was one of those}} that participated in the 1979 'internal settlement'. Association with the UDI state and with the internal settlement carried a collaborationist stigma that would damage the credibility of the black politicians involved.|$|R

5000|$|Among revival films {{screened}} was {{the curious}} 1975 Seattle production The Last Bath. Two storefronts {{down from the}} Pike Street Cinema was a tattoo parlor which sponsored a revival of The Illustrated Man starring Rod Steiger on a double feature with the film noir The Tattooed Stranger. Anyone who showed a tattoo got a dollar off at the door. Also revived were a series of Frederick Wiseman documentary films including Titicut Follies, High School, Law and Order, Meat, and Primate. The film [...] "Sparkles Tavern" [...] had its Seattle premiere at the Pike St. in October 1992. The world premiere of Sparkle's Tavern had been scheduled for the 1984 Seattle International Film Festival with Curt McDowell, George Kuchar and Marion Eaton in person. At {{the time of the}} screening no complete print was ready. The screening was attempted with <b>a</b> and <b>B</b> unmarried <b>rolls</b> projected with an interlock system. It failed with refunds given to the full house crowd.|$|R
5000|$|DNCE {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, it received an average score of 77, based on 4 reviews. Matt Collar of AllMusic wrote that [...] "it's band's stylistically open-minded approach to pop that makes DNCE such a joyous and undeniably fun album." [...] Collar also complimented frontman Joe Jonas {{for being a}} [...] "deeply self-aware and confident performer." [...] Nolan Feeney of Entertainment Weekly commented on a lack of clear identity on the album, but conceded that the group [...] "ultimately finds its groove with retro, funk-heavy tracks like new single [...] "Body Moves" [...] and [...] "Blown,"" [...] grading the album <b>a</b> <b>B.</b> Writing for <b>Rolling</b> Stone, Brittany Spanos called the album [...] "a mature spin on the boy band formula that worked so well for Jonas and his brothers in the past," [...] and wrote that [...] "DNCE's greatest strength is never taking themselves too seriously." ...|$|R
25|$|In 1969, the {{constitution}} was modified. The most significant 1969 modification was the formal separation of two electoral rolls by race. The A roll {{was reserved for}} Europeans and the <b>B</b> <b>roll</b> for non-Europeans. The Assembly constituencies were reformed so that there were 50 <b>A</b> <b>roll,</b> and 8 <b>B</b> <b>roll</b> seats. In addition, the tribal chiefs were able to elect another 8 members. Effectively, {{the result was that}} 270,000 whites had 50 seats and 6 million Africans had 16 seats in the Assembly. These reforms served only to reinforce black rejection of the system.|$|R
25|$|Under the 1961 Constitution, the Legislative Assembly had 65 elected members: 50 {{constituency}} {{members and}} 15 district members. The voter rolls had education, property and income qualifications. The main A roll was for citizens who satisfied high standards in these regards and 95% {{of its members}} were white and 5% were black or Asian. The <b>B</b> <b>roll</b> had lower qualification standards and 90% of its members were black and 10% were white or Asian. The <b>B</b> <b>roll</b> was about one-tenth {{of the size of}} the A roll. Both rolls voted in elections for constituencies and districts, but for elections in the constituencies, the <b>B</b> <b>roll</b> vote was capped at 20% of the total, and for elections in the districts, the A roll vote was capped at 20% of the total. This procedure was known as 'cross-voting'. In practice, the 50 constituency members would all be white and the 15 district members would mostly be black.|$|R

50|$|Under its 1961 Constitution, the British {{colony of}} Southern Rhodesia {{provided}} {{for a special}} form of weighted voting called cross-voting. Essentially, voters were rounded up in two voters' rolls, with the A roll bearing requirements generally reached by the European-descended population, but only {{in a few cases}} by Africans. The <b>B</b> <b>roll</b> provided for many Africans and a few Europeans, but not all the adult population. Despite its limited size in terms of voters, the A roll played the major influence in electing the 65 members of parliament, which was further bolstered by the lack of support to sign up for the <b>B</b> <b>roll,</b> and its much lower turnout.|$|R

2500|$|The Rhodesian Front's {{victory in}} the 1962 general {{election}} and the subsequent UDI were in the populist tradition of Rhodesian politics. The early history of Rhodesian politics was very much one of electoral uprisings by miners, industrial workers and farmers against the big business establishment that dominated the colony. The election of the Reform Party government led by Godfrey Huggins in 1933 {{had a great deal}} in common with the RF win in 1962. It has been argued that the racial dimension of UDI was an incidental thing. Economic recessions in the early 1930s and the early 1960s had both produced the election of populist governments committed to securing standards of living for working people (albeit, the immediate concern was for working white people). It is significant that in the 1962 election, the RF recruited a slate of black candidates to contest the district (essentially <b>B</b> <b>roll)</b> seats. Those black RF candidates obtained little support from the <b>B</b> <b>roll</b> electorate and none were elected.|$|R

For the constituencies, if the <b>B</b> <b>roll</b> total exceeded one-fifth of the total votes, it was devalued to a maximum of one-fifth. In practice, this never happened, due to the African nationalist campaign to boycott elections. For the districts, if the A roll total exceeded one-fifth of the total votes, it was devalued to a maximum of one-fifth. This was always the case.|$|R
