30|$|To {{test the}} null {{hypothesis}} of the true asset pricing model (FFC-model) {{it is necessary to}} form portfolios of stocks that have similar characteristics but different risk factor exposures. They are referred to as characteristics-balanced (CB) portfolios (Daniel and Titman 1998). <b>A</b> <b>CB</b> portfolio goes long (short) in a portfolio of stocks with high (low) factor loadings while the characteristics of both portfolios are nearly equal. If there is a linear relation between risk exposures and returns (and the risk premium is positive) then <b>a</b> <b>CB</b> portfolio should have a positive average return. A positive average return of <b>a</b> <b>CB</b> portfolio cannot be due to differences in the characteristics as there should be no differences in the firm characteristics in <b>a</b> <b>CB</b> portfolio. In contrast, if the average return on <b>a</b> <b>CB</b> portfolio is zero we should reject the FFC-model because there is no linear relation between exposures and asset returns.|$|R
