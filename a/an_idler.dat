The steering system was set up so that gentle turns used just the steerable front wheels, but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther the steering wheel was turned. The drive sprocket had the track-saving but more complicated rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of five double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the Schachtellaufwerk layout, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. <b>An</b> <b>idler</b> wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension.

25|$|A {{design feature}} of the Peregrine {{was that it was}} {{produced}} in both right- and left-hand tractor variants. This was done to improve aircraft handling by providing a counter-rotating propeller facility. This was a common feature of German designs, but relatively rare on UK engines. The handing of internal parts to achieve this was a considerable complication that was later abandoned in favour of <b>an</b> <b>idler</b> gear arrangement for the Merlin propeller reduction gear.|$|E
5000|$|An {{intermediate}} gear {{which does not}} drive a shaft to perform any work is called an [...] gear. Sometimes, <b>a</b> single <b>idler</b> gear is used to reverse the direction, in which case it may {{be referred to as}} <b>a</b> reverse <b>idler.</b> For instance, the typical automobile manual transmission engages reverse gear by means of inserting <b>a</b> reverse <b>idler</b> between two gears.|$|R

25|$|Normally the {{steering}} shaft {{is connected to}} the engine directly, instead of the output from the transmission. This means it spins at a relatively narrow range of RPM compared to the main drive shaft. The steering shaft is split into two output shafts through a clutch system that allows the outputs to spin forward, backward, or not at all. <b>An</b> <b>idler</b> reverses the direction on one side, so they always spin in opposite directions.|$|E
25|$|The Type 62 light tank {{uses the}} torsion bar {{suspension}} {{which consists of}} five road wheels on each side with a prominent gap {{between the first and}} second road wheel and an even space between second, third, fourth and fifth road wheel. The road wheels are smaller and lighter than those from the Type 59 main battle tank. The track is driven by a drive sprocket at the rear, with <b>an</b> <b>idler</b> at the front. There are no return rollers. In effort to reduce the overall weight of the tank the original 12150L 12-cylinder liquid-cooled diesel engine from Type 59 main battle tank was powered down from 523hp (390kW) to 430hp (321kW). This modified version of the 12150L engine weights considerably less and was designated 12150L-3. This new engine gave the Type 62 a maximum road speed of 60km/h, maximum cross country speed of 35km/h, maximum road operational range of 500km and power-to-weight ratio of 20.5hp/tonne (15.3kW/tonne). The tank can cross 0.8 m high vertical obstacles, 2.85 m trenches, 30° side slopes and ford 1.4 m deep water obstacles (5 m when equipped with a snorkel).|$|E
25|$|The engine {{compartment}} {{is located in}} the rear of the vehicle and consists of: a 2V-06-02 water-cooled diesel engine developing 450hp, a main clutch, a gearbox, a final drives, and brakes. The suspension of the vehicle consists of five rubber-tyred road wheels on each side, a drive sprocket at the rear, <b>an</b> <b>idler</b> at the front, and four track-return rollers. The BMD-3 is fitted with a new hydromechanical transmission with hydrostatic steering mechanism. This adjustable suspension gives a ground clearance between 130 and 530mm with 450mm being the default. This hydropneumatic suspension allows the BMD-3 to decrease its height to be able to board transport aircraft like the Il-76M. The ground clearance is adjusted by the driver and it takes 10 seconds to lower or raise the suspension. The maximum road speed is 70km/h and the maximum off-road speed is 45km/h. The vehicle can achieve an operational range of up to 500km on paved roads and can climb up to 60% gradient and move on a 30% side slope. The ground pressure exerted by the BMD-3 is 0.48 kg/cm2 with standard tracks and 0.32kg/cm2 with broader tracks.|$|E

40|$|Recently leading {{producers}} of farm tractors even more often apply in running systems triangular caterpillar contour (Tɋɋ). In such running system {{one of the}} most problem knots is the back idler (BI) which is loaded by reaction from a caterpillar track and from weight of the casco having on this support. Thus the vertical component of reaction from a tension of a caterpillar track in addition loads with a tie-rod tangential force suspension bracket BI, thereby disturbing with a casco and reducing smoothness of a course of a tractor. Modelling and the analysis of dependence of affecting of vibration on a seat of the motor-man depending on applied type of a suspension bracket of <b>a</b> back <b>idler</b> are in-process executed. The analysis of parameters of smoothness of a course for the circuit design with triangular caterpillar contour and the offered suspension bracket of <b>a</b> back <b>idler</b> showed that in comparison with base configuration of a tractor of family VT On transport operations, at traffic on the soil road with the lifted tool, affectings on a seat of the operator decrease in 1, 1 - 1, 7 times in vertical and in 1. 1 - 1. 2 times in horizontal directions, at work with nominal loading, and also with Rkr= 50 kN, on an eddish, provides minor alteration of smoothness of a course, the divergence of values of affecting on a seat of the operator, on the average, makes 12 – 19 %.
