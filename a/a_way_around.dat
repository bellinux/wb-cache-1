5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1922 the {{coalition}} government Birkenhead {{was a member of}} began to splinter, and when it finally collapsed Birkenhead was forced to resign on 25 October 1922. His replacement was Lord Cave, a member of the new Conservative government who was appointed on 27 October 1922. The Conservative government under Stanley Baldwin soon ran into trouble due to his desire to introduce protectionist tariffs to protect British jobs. Baldwin called an early general election in December 1923 to serve as a referendum on the subject, and although the Conservatives remained the largest party they did not have enough Members of Parliament to claim a parliamentary majority. At the opening of the new Parliament in January 1924 the party was defeated in a vote of no confidence, and the king instead invited the Labour Party under Ramsay MacDonald to form a government. This caused various constitutional problems; traditionally every member of a cabinet, including the Prime Minister, must be a Privy Councillor. MacDonald was not a Privy Councillor, and therefore could not be made Prime Minister. The king asked Lord Cave for <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> this problem, and as an expert on constitutional issues Schuster helped draft the response. In the end it was determined that MacDonald would be sworn in as a Privy Councillor and then invited to form a government.|$|E
5|$|Upsher and Doff: Upsher and Doff are {{a tabloid}} {{journalist}} and photographer, respectively, {{from the planet}} Jetsam, who work for a tabloid called The Hebdomadal, and who are also lovers. First appearing in issue #13, their speech, like all people from Jetsam, is rendered {{in the form of}} blue text surrounded by speech balloons that more closely resemble traditional comics thought bubbles. Jetsam is a partially underwater society, as its natives possess an amphibious physiology, and are capable of surviving in and out of water. Upsher and Doff experience more than one confrontation with Freelancers hired {{to put an end to}} their investigation. The Brand poisons them with embargon, a substance that will kill them if they report their findings about the family to anyone else, though they attempt to find <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> this in order to continue their investigation. After they learn The Brand is dead, they attempt to resume their investigation, but are confronted by The Will, who drafts them into his service.|$|E

However, on the next lap, Patrese spun and he could not select full gears then. He went to the pits and retired. At the same time, Prost passed Berger to take third. Mansell now began to hound Senna and went all directions to get ahead.|$|E
25|$|Burton {{had long}} had an {{interest}} in sexuality and some erotic literature. However, the Obscene Publications Act of 1857 had resulted in many jail sentences for publishers, with prosecutions being brought by the Society for the Suppression of Vice. Burton referred to the society and those who shared its views as Mrs Grundy. <b>A</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> this was the private circulation of books amongst the members of a society. For this reason Burton, together with Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot, created the Kama Shastra Society to print and circulate books that would be illegal to publish in public.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{the passage}} of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005, sales of the drug became {{increasingly}} regulated, as DEA regulators and pharmaceutical companies continued to fight for their respective positions. The DEA continued to make greater progress in their attempts to control pseudoephedrine as methamphetamine production skyrocketed, becoming a serious problem in the western United States. When purity dropped, so did {{the number of people in}} rehab and people admitted to emergency rooms with methamphetamine in their systems. However, this reduction in purity was usually short lived, as methamphetamine producers eventually found <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> the new regulations.|$|E
25|$|While the JIFF policy {{worked on}} one level—the {{number of foreign}} players {{recruited}} into the Top 14 went from 61 for 2011–12 to 34 for 2014–15—clubs quickly found <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> the rules. Many clubs dispatched scouts to identify top teenage prospects in other countries, and then enrolled them in their academies to start the JIFF qualification process. For example, the 59 players in the 2015–16 Clermont youth squad included 17 from nine countries outside of France. A more fundamental problem was identified in 2015 by Laurent Labit, at the time backs coach of the club now known as Racing 92. In an interview with British rugby journalist Gavin Mortimer, Labit pointed out that France has no organized team sport in its educational system at the primary level—children must join an outside club in order to play sports. Only at age 15 do youths {{have the opportunity to}} attend special sporting schools, but places in such institutions are limited. In turn, this means that young French players are technically well behind their counterparts in many other countries, most notably those of the Commonwealth.|$|E
25|$|American {{occupation}} {{troops in}} Nuristan would find themselves directly {{in opposition to}} the HIG forces prepared by the CIA to resist the Soviets. Colonel Pat Donahue, the former commander of the 3rd BCT, had believed that Nuristani population was essentially neutral, hostile to any outside groups, and so isolated that resources allocated to the region would be wasted. These resources were limited by the fact that only 5,000 American troops were available to occupy a rugged area the size of Virginia that had very {{little in the way of}} Infrastructure. A new Counter-insurgency strategy seemed to offer <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> these problems. Known as COIN and refined by General Petraeus, Commander of US forces in Afghanistan, the Army and Marine Counter-insurgency Field Manual FM 3-24 would convert the population of Nuristan to American goals in the region. Unlike Donahue, Nicholson was a supporter of COIN in addition to seeing Kamdesh as a decisive control point in the region. The basic approach to victory by the PRT would involve three steps: 1. Separate the enemy from the people. 2. Link the people to their government. 3. Transform Afghanistan by economic development and the creation of a national infrastructure. Nicholson hoped the PRT would seed a process that would be developed by the local Nuristanis rather than completely imposed from the outside. Lieutenant Keating, first commander of the Kamdesh PRT, was determined to make COIN a success in the region.|$|E

500|$|A {{collateral}} {{contract is}} a contract where the consideration is the entry into another subordinate contract, which co-exists {{side by side}} with the main contract. Because this normally involves parties who are not part of the main contract, it has been used as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> the doctrine of privity. The habit of the courts finding collateral contracts to allow an injured third party to sue has been criticised, however, as [...] "exceedingly artificial", and in light of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 the use of this has been predicted to decrease.|$|E

Romanek hoped the audience of Never Let Me Go would be reminded of what is important: love, behaviour, and friendships. He recalled an email a person had written to him: [...] "I saw your film and it made me cry and I haven't reacted to a film emotionally like that in years. And I called my father, cause I realized I hadn’t spoken to him in 3 weeks and I told him how much I love him and how much I appreciated what a good father he's been." ...|$|E

His father, a vocal anti–Vietnam War critic, was facing a reelection in 1970. Gore eventually decided {{that the best way}} he could contribute to the anti-war effort was to enlist in the Army, which would improve his father's reelection prospects. Although nearly all of his Harvard classmates avoided the draft and service in Vietnam, Gore believed if he found <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> military service, he would be handing an issue to his father's Republican opponent. According to Gore's Senate biography, [...] "He appeared in uniform in his father's campaign commercials, one of which ended with his father advising: 'Son, always love your country'."

He was brevetted brigadier general and assumed command of the 2nd Brigade in David E. Twiggs's Second Division. [...] He led his brigade at the Battle of Contreras and the Battle of Churubusco, where Winfield Scott gave him credit for the U.S. victory: Riley had {{discovered}} <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> the rear of Velencia's position.

500|$|Although Sitting Bull did {{not attack}} Custer's {{expedition}} in 1874, the US government was increasingly pressured by citizens {{to open the}} Black Hills to mining and settlement. Failing {{in an attempt to}} negotiate a purchase or lease of the Hills, the government in Washington had to find <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> the promise to protect the Sioux in their land, as specified in the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. It was alarmed at reports of Sioux depredations (encouraged by Sitting Bull). In November 1875, President Grant ordered all Sioux bands outside the Great Sioux Reservation to move onto the reservation, knowing full well that not all would comply. As of February 1, 1876, the Interior Department certified as [...] "hostile" [...] those bands who continued to live off the reservation. This certification allowed the military to pursue Sitting Bull and other Lakota bands as [...] "hostiles".|$|E
500|$|Trusts {{have been}} used as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> the {{original}} doctrine of privity. A trust is an arrangement where the owner of property gives it to a second party (a trustee) to manage on behalf of a third party (a beneficiary). In this situation the House of Lords decided (in Les Affréteurs v Walford [...] AC 801) that the trustee's ability to sue the owner of the property is to be exercised on behalf of the beneficiary, a third party. This is known as a [...] "trust of the promise", and, while artificial, it bypassed the doctrine of privity. The trust exception has been heavily undermined by the decision in Re Schebsman [...] Ch 83, which requires a court to find evidence of an intent to create a trust of the promise rather than simply using the requirement as an intention as a fiction to allow the courts to enact the trust exception.|$|E

500|$|One {{of these}} adventurers was E.T. Barnette, who {{intended}} {{to establish a}} trading post at Tanacross, Alaska, where the Valdez-Eagle Trail crossed the Tanana River. He hired the steamer Lavelle Young to transport him and his supplies, and they began their trip upriver in August 1901. After turning into the Tanana from the Yukon, the steamboat ran into low water. After venturing upstream several miles, the boat reached an impassable point. Barnette suggested the Chena River (then called the Rock River) might be a slough of the Tanana and <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> the low water. About [...] {{from the mouth of}} the Chena, the Lavelle Young again ran into an impassable stretch of river.

500|$|In a 2010 column, Colum Lynch of Foreign Policy {{magazine}} {{criticized the}} resolution {{as one of}} the ten worst UN resolutions in history. After the Soviet Union ended its boycott of the council, it used its veto power to block any further resolutions against North Korea. In response, Acheson introduced a new procedure to the UN General Assembly to allow a member state to bypass the UNSC and seek approval in the General Assembly, including recommendations on the use of force, United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377. When this was passed, it allowed for open-ended General Assembly emergency special sessions to address threats to international peace and security for which the UNSC was unable to pass a resolution. Lynch wrote that the creation of this rule caused unintended negative consequences for the United States [...] in 1997 when several Arab states began the Tenth emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly to address the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and Israel's occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. This session, convened as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> a US veto, spanned 30 meetings over the next ten years, and has never formally been closed.|$|E
