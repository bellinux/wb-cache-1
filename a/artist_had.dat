5|$|By {{the time}} of his death, his {{reputation}} and fame were waning, and his passing was little noticed within the artistic community. His artwork had certainly been acknowledged during his lifetime, but not widely. While the close study of landscape and an emphasis on the spiritual elements of nature were commonplace in contemporary art, his work was too original and personal to be well understood. By 1838, his work no longer sold or received attention from critics; the Romantic movement had been moving away from the early idealism that the <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> helped found.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, Miloš's {{descendant}} King Alexander visited Jovanović at his Vienna {{studio and}} requested {{a painting of}} the revolt to commemorate its 75th anniversary. With his rise in stature, the <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> found himself producing numerous replicas of his earlier Orientalist works. According to biographer Nikola Kusovac, Jovanović grew bored with painting replicas and considered taking up a different genre. Alexander's request presented Jovanović {{with an opportunity to}} deviate from Orientalism and try his hand at history painting. The Takovo Uprising was his first historical composition.|$|E
5|$|Morris died in 1896, and {{the health}} of the devastated Burne-Jones {{declined}} substantially. In 1898 he suffered an attack of influenza, and had apparently recovered when he was again taken suddenly ill, and died on 17June 1898. Six days later, at the intervention of the Prince of Wales, a memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey. It was the first time an <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> been so honoured. Burne-Jones was buried in the churchyard at St Margaret's Church, Rottingdean, a place he knew through summer family holidays.|$|E
25|$|Female <b>artists</b> <b>have</b> {{received}} {{little to no}} recognition in hip hop.

50|$|Very few female <b>artists</b> <b>have</b> been {{recognized}} in hip hop, {{and the most}} popular, successful and influential artists, record producers and music executives are males.

5|$|Before the game, Cirque du Soleil, Romero Britto and Little Louie Vega {{performed}} as the pre-game act, and Billy Joel sang the National Anthem, accompanying himself on piano. He also performed at Super Bowl XXIII, which was {{played at the}} same venue. Joel became the second person to sing the National Anthem twice for a Super Bowl; Aaron Neville sang the national anthem before Super Bowl XXIV, in New Orleans, and Super Bowl XL (along with Aretha Franklin), in Detroit. This was also the last time until Luke Bryan sang at Super Bowl LI that a male <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> sung the national anthem at a Super Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Costa {{was chosen}} as Down Beat jazz critics' new star on piano and vibes for 1957; {{this was the first}} time that one <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> won two {{categories}} in the same year. In 1962 he was invited to play at the first International Jazz Festival in Washington, D.C. by the President's Music Committee of the People to People program. An indication of the esteem in which Costa was held by musicians is the caliber of those who performed at his memorial concert at The Village Gate on October 8, 1962: Cohn, Benny Golson, Zoot Sims, Charlie Byrd, Jim Hall, Mundell Lowe, Farmer, Clark Terry and Hawkins were among those who played. The playing of the bands led by the last two was recorded and released as an LP. Hawkins did not usually play at benefit concerts, but his feelings for Costa meant that he did what he could to make the seven-hour event a success.|$|E
5|$|The realist Paja Jovanović (1859–1957) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} 19th- and 20th-century Serbian painters. He was a native of the town of Vršac, then part of the Hungarian-administered Banat region of Austria-Hungary, which had a mixed population of Serbs, Hungarians and Germans. Most of the Serbs were descended from 14th-century migrants fleeing the Ottoman advance following the Battle of Kosovo in June 1389. Such diversity and multiculturalism ensured the town's reputation for prosperity and cultural enlightenment. Jovanović's artistic abilities were noticed at an early age, and nourished by his father, a professional photographer. His early development was informed by the portraits and religious paintings of artists such as Pavel Đurković, Jovan Popović and Arsenije Teodorović. Jovanović's early copies of the artworks available to him in Vršac brought him instant recognition and steered him towards a career in the arts. In his adolescence, the <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> observed people from the Vršac countryside and their customs, and compiled sketches of natural and man-made structures in and around the town. While a student, he was commissioned to draw a series of preparatory sketches for the bell tower of his hometown's main church.|$|E

5|$|During the 43 {{nomination}} years, 87 <b>artists</b> <b>have</b> been nominated; 37 of {{them have}} won, including ties.

No other <b>artists</b> <b>have</b> won more than once. Potter and John Picacio have received the most nominations at ten, followed by Canty, Don Maitz, and Whelan at nine each. Stephen Fabian and John Jude Palencar are tied at eight for the most nominations without winning.|$|R

25|$|December 2006: German comedian Atze Schröder sued Arne Klempert, {{secretary}} of Wikimedia Deutschland, {{because he did}} not want his real name published in Wikipedia.

25|$|Since 2000, {{there are}} two {{oversized}} Gwendolines that confine the stage on both sides (especially at outdoor concerts). The commissioned <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> first colored the figures independently. However, after the Hard Pop Days were played with these colorful editions and a houseboat at Popkomm in Cologne was adorned with them, they were recolored into classic black and white design.|$|E

40|$|<b>Artists</b> <b>have</b> {{long been}} viewed as pioneers of gentrification, and yet {{contemporary}} studies also point to how <b>artists</b> themselves <b>have</b> been displaced {{as a consequence of}} the revalorisation of property.

25|$|The crown {{is wrong}} in the Queen's {{portrait}}. When the new coin portrait was first issued in 1990 (see above), a legend surfaced that the <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> simply added {{the image of a}} crown to a portrait of the Queen, and that she was never meant to be seen wearing that headgear. This is patently false; she posed personally for the portrait wearing one of her usual crowns.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, {{her work}} Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995, a tent appliquéd {{with the names}} of {{everyone}} the <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> ever shared a bed with was shown at Charles Saatchi's Sensation exhibition held at the Royal Academy in London. The same year, she gained considerable media exposure when she swore repeatedly in a state of drunkenness on a live discussion programme called The Death of Painting on British television.|$|E
25|$|By 1984, Kahlo's {{reputation}} as an <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> grown to such extent that Mexico declared her works national cultural heritage, prohibiting their export from the country. As a result, her paintings seldom appear in international auctions and comprehensive retrospectives are rare. Regardless, her paintings have still broken records for Latin American art in the 1990s and 2000s. In 1990, {{she became the first}} Latin American artist to break the one-million-dollar threshold when Diego and I was auctioned by Sotheby's for $1,430,000.|$|E

25|$|Van Gogh {{also wrote}} to Wilhelmina {{regarding}} the Portraits of Madame Ginoux he painted first in Arles in 1888 {{and again in}} February 1890 while at the hospital in Saint-Rémy. The second set were styled after the portrait of the same figure by Gauguin, and Van Gogh described Gachet's enthusiasm upon viewing the version painted earlier that year, which the <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> carried {{with him to the}} home in Auvers. Van Gogh subsequently carried compositional elements from this portrait to that of Dr. Gachet, including the table-top with two books and pose of the figure with head leaning on one hand.|$|E
25|$|In 1899, at age 22, {{he opened}} W. H. Hodgson's School of Physical Culture in Blackburn, England, {{offering}} tailored exercise regimes for personal training. Among his customers {{were members of}} the Blackburn police force. In 1902, Hodgson himself appeared on stage with handcuffs and other restraining devices supplied by the Blackburn police department and applied the restraints to Harry Houdini, who had previously escaped from the Blackburn jail. His behavior towards Houdini generated controversy; the escape <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> some difficulty removing his restraints, complaining that Hodgson had deliberately injured him and jammed the locks of his handcuffs.|$|E
25|$|William Morris {{died after}} a {{lingering}} illness in October 1896. Edward Burne-Jones, {{who had been}} Morris's friend and partner since their college days, was devastated, and his health declined substantially. In 1898 he had an attack of influenza, and had apparently recovered, when he was again taken suddenly ill, and {{died of a heart}} attack in the early hours of 17 June 1898. Six days later, at the intervention of the Prince of Wales, a memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey. It was the first time an <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> been so honoured. Burne-Jones was cremated and his ashes were buried in a grave lined with moss and roses at the village church in Rottingdean.|$|E

25|$|Cassatt {{saw that}} works by female artists were often {{dismissed}} with contempt unless the <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> {{a friend or}} protector on the jury, {{and she would not}} flirt with jurors to curry favor. Her cynicism grew when one of the two pictures she submitted in 1875 was refused by the jury, only to be accepted the following year after she darkened the background. She had quarrels with Sartain, who thought Cassatt too outspoken and self-centered, and eventually they parted. Out of her distress and self-criticism, Cassatt decided that she needed to move away from genre paintings and onto more fashionable subjects, in order to attract portrait commissions from American socialites abroad, but that attempt bore little fruit at first.|$|E
25|$|The {{paintings}} {{from this period}} are most remarkable for the vividness of the extreme violence and even the human denigration that is often depicted. Such representations are however, also rich in a lyrical content that was to characterise the artist from then on. The juxtaposition of the international tendencies that formed Orellana took a more definite form in this period: his old Spanish inheritance, the input from America, the wealth of archaeological culture and Italy with Conceptualism and Arte Povera. The <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> a solo show at the stand of Juana Mordo at the FIAC 1978, Paris, France. These amalgamated into a whole that {{paved the way for}} new developments in Orellana's work.|$|E
25|$|He {{also contributed}} a {{portrait}} of the then-still-living Robert E. Lee to the gallery. The <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> not known any of these men personally, and thus had to rely on photographs and descriptions from their colleagues to complete their likenesses. Many of Washington's portraits are still on display in Preston Library on the VMI campus. Also in the Institute's collections are a number of landscapes and genre paintings he completed after poems by Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Washington was also active in promoting the Institute's cultural life; he founded an art gallery on campus, for which he secured funding from William Wilson Corcoran, and taught fine arts to those students who desired such instruction. Among his pupils was Richard Norris Brooke.|$|E
