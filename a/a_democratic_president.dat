5|$|Legislation {{proposed}} by the 104th United States Congress included term limits for Congressional Representatives, tax cuts, welfare reform, and a balanced budget amendment, as well as independent auditing of the finances of the House of Representatives and elimination of non-essential services such as the House barbershop and shoe-shine concessions. Following Gingrich's first two years as House Speaker, the Republican majority was re-elected in the 1996 election, the first time Republicans had done so in 68 years, {{and the first time}} simultaneously with <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>president</b> winning re-election.|$|E
5|$|Willkie {{spent much}} of 1943 {{preparing}} for a second presidential run, addressing Republican and nonpartisan groups. He did not meet with Roosevelt; with the presidential election approaching and with both men likely to run in it as candidates, their continued association would have been awkward. Although they differed with him on many issues, Republican leaders recognized Willkie's appeal and they had wanted him to campaign for the party in the 1942 midterm elections, but he went around the world instead. The huge publicity received by the titular head of the Republican Party as an emissary for <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>president</b> frustrated leading Republicans. In spite of this, the Republicans gained seats in both the House and the Senate, though they still remained in the minority. Few Republican members of Congress were by then willing to support Willkie, and he dropped to second place behind General Douglas MacArthur in polls of likely voters in the party's 1944 presidential primaries. By 1943, even liberal Democrats did not doubt Willkie's progressive credentials. He spoke of appointing an African American to either the cabinet or the Supreme Court, and he warned California's Republican committee that the New Deal was irreversible and he stated that all they would get by opposing it was oblivion.|$|E
25|$|Scheele {{served as}} surgeon general first under <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>President,</b> Harry S. Truman, who {{appointed}} Scheele as Surgeon General Parran's successor on April 6, 1948, and 4 years later under a Republican, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, his former commander during the war. Scheele built on his wartime experience and carried on PHS's leadership in international health, leading the U.S. delegations to the World Health Assembly (1949 through 1953) and serving twice as President of the World Health Organization.|$|E
50|$|The Democratic National Convention held in St. Louis, Missouri, on June 5-7, 1888, was harmonious. Incumbent President Cleveland was re-nominated {{unanimously}} {{without a}} formal ballot. This {{was the first}} time <b>an</b> incumbent <b>Democratic</b> <b>president</b> had been re-nominated since Martin Van Buren in 1840.|$|R
5000|$|The 1978 cycle {{marked the}} last midterm {{election}} in which <b>a</b> sitting <b>Democratic</b> <b>president</b> saw his party retain {{control of both}} houses of Congress. Consequently, 1977-1981 was the last period in which Democrats had control of both the White House and Congress {{for more than two}} years.|$|R

25|$|Long {{before the}} {{election}} of President Obama, Associate Justice David H. Souter had {{expressed a desire to}} leave Washington, D.C., and return to his native New Hampshire. The election of <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>president</b> in 2008 made Souter more inclined to retire, but {{he did not want to}} create a situation in which there would be multiple vacancies at once. Souter apparently became satisfied that no other justices planned to retire at the end of the Supreme Court's term in June 2009. As a result, in mid-April 2009 he privately notified the White House of his intent to retire from the Supreme Court at the conclusion of its business for that term. Souter submitted a resignation letter to Obama on May 1, who later that day made an unscheduled appearance during the daily White House press briefing to publicly announce Souter's retirement.|$|E
500|$|Bayard was {{admitted}} to the bar in 1851, the year his father was elected to the United States Senate. [...] Thomas took on greater responsibilities in the family law office, and rose quickly in the legal profession. In 1853, after the election of <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>president,</b> Franklin Pierce, Thomas Bayard was appointed United States Attorney for Delaware. He spent only a year in the position before moving to Philadelphia to open a practice with his friend William Shippen, a partnership that lasted until Shippen's death in 1858. While in Philadelphia, Bayard met Louise Lee, whom he married in October 1856. The marriage produced twelve children.|$|E
500|$|Like his Republican predecessors, Arthur {{struggled}} {{with the question of}} how his party was to challenge the Democrats in the South and how, if at all, to protect the civil rights of black southerners. [...] Since the end of Reconstruction, conservative white Democrats (or [...] "Bourbon Democrats") had regained power in the South, and the Republican party dwindled rapidly as their primary supporters in the region, blacks, were disenfranchised. [...] One crack in the solidly Democratic South emerged with the growth of a new party, the Readjusters, in Virginia. [...] Having won an election in that state on a platform of more education funding (for black and white schools alike) and abolition of the poll tax and the whipping post, many northern Republicans saw the Readjusters as a more viable ally in the South than the moribund southern Republican party. [...] Arthur agreed, and directed the federal patronage in Virginia through the Readjusters rather than the Republicans. [...] He followed the same pattern in other Southern states, forging coalitions with independents and Greenback Party members. [...] Some black Republicans felt betrayed by the pragmatic gambit, but others (including Frederick Douglass and ex-Senator Blanche K. Bruce) endorsed the administration's actions, as the Southern independents had more liberal racial policies than the Democrats. [...] Arthur's coalition policy was only successful in Virginia, however, and by 1885 the Readjuster movement began to collapse with the election of <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>president.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1864 the Democratic Party {{split into}} two wings over the {{question}} of whether to continue the American Civil War or back down and negotiate peace with the Confederacy. The War Democrats fused with the Republicans to elect <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> Vice <b>President,</b> Andrew Johnson, and re-elect a Republican President, Abraham Lincoln.|$|R

2500|$|On December 17, 2007, Lieberman {{endorsed}} Republican Senator John McCain {{for president}} in 2008, going against his party and going back on his stance in July 2006 when he stated [...] "I want Democrats {{to be back in}} the majority in Washington and elect <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>president</b> in 2008." [...] Lieberman cited his agreement with McCain's stance on the War on Terrorism as the primary reason for the endorsement.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{well-known}} Democratic Party member to support McCain was Senator Joe Lieberman, {{who had run}} for vice-president as a Democrat in 2000. On December 17, 2007, Lieberman endorsed McCain, contradicting his stance in July 2006 where he stated, [...] "I want Democrats {{to be back in}} the majority in Washington and elect <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>president</b> in 2008." [...] Lieberman cited his agreement with McCain's stance on the War on Terrorism as the primary reason for the endorsement.|$|E
2500|$|Olbermann has {{addressed}} the assertions of liberal bias {{by stating that}} he would be equally critical of <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>president</b> who had invited criticism by his actions: [...] "I mean, no one in 1998, no one accused me of being a liberal in 1998 because I was covering the Lewinsky scandal. And whatever I had to do about it, I tried to be fair and honest and as accurate and as informed as possible, and allow my viewer to be the same way. And nowadays it's the same thing. And {{now all of a sudden}} I’m a screaming liberal." ...|$|E
5000|$|Beebe hasn't {{seen his}} {{approval}} rating slip below 70 percent at any point during his tenure, according to yearly polls from the University of Arkansas. According to the FiveThirtyEight Blog, [...] "Beebe's crossover appeal — and the recent history in Arkansas of producing <b>a</b> popular <b>Democratic</b> <b>president</b> — might suggest Mr. Beebe, who will be term-limited in 2014, would be among the more talked-about 2016 contenders." ...|$|R

50|$|In an interview, Bachmann {{stated that}} the last swine flu {{outbreak}} had occurred under President Carter, and suggested that there was <b>a</b> relation between <b>Democratic</b> <b>presidents</b> and swine flu outbreaks. In fact, the last two swine flu outbreaks occurred under President Ford and President Reagan, both Republicans.|$|R
2500|$|... 1996 saw Buchanan's most {{successful}} attempt {{to win the}} Republican nomination. [...] With <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>President</b> (Bill Clinton) seeking re-election, there was no incumbent Republican with a lock on the ticket. Indeed, with former President George H. W. Bush having made clear he {{was not interested in}} re-gaining the office, the closest the party had to a front-runner was the Senate Majority leader Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, who was considered to have many weaknesses. [...] Buchanan sought the Republican nomination from Dole's right, voicing his opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Other candidates for the nomination included Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, former Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander and the multi-millionaire publisher Steve Forbes.|$|E
2500|$|The Drafting Committee {{consisted}} of fifteen members. Under party rules, {{the chair of}} the Democratic National Committee had the power to name all fifteen members of the Drafting Committee, which has typically been done in the past in consultation with the White House (if <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>president</b> is sitting) and the presumptive nominee. In 2016, however, DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz opted [...] "to allocate 75% of the committee's seats to the presidential campaigns, awarding the slots proportionally according to the current vote tally" [...] in a bid for wider representation of party members. As a result, Clinton appointed six members to the committee, Sanders five, and Wasserman Schultz four. This was the outcome of an agreement among the Bernie Sanders campaign, the Hillary Clinton campaign, and party officials, and was viewed as a victory for Sanders, who gained some influence on the party platform as result.|$|E
2500|$|Once Huerta was ousted, {{the power}} {{struggle}} between factions {{of the revolution}} came into the open. The revolutionary caudillos convened the Convention of Aguascalientes, attempting to sort out power in the political sphere {{rather than on the}} battlefield. This meeting set out path towards democracy. None of the armed revolutionaries were allowed to be nominated for government positions, and Eulalio Gutierrez was chosen as interim president. Emiliano Zapata, a military general from southern Mexico, and Villa met at the convention. Zapata was sympathetic to Villa's hostile views of Carranza and told Villa he feared Carranza's intentions were those of a dictator and not of <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>president.</b> Fearing that Carranza was intending to impose a dictatorship, Villa and Zapata broke with him. Carranza opposed the agreements of the Convention, which rejected his leadership as [...] "first chief" [...] of the Revolution. The Army of the Convention was constituted with the alliance of Villa and Zapata, and [...] a civil war of the winners ensued.|$|E
5000|$|In the 2000 U.S. presidential election, Weigel {{voted for}} Ralph Nader, {{and served as}} a Delaware college elector for Nader. In the 2004 election, Weigel voted for John Kerry. Weigel later wrote that [...] "regrets the Nader vote, but not the Kerry vote, as <b>a</b> weak <b>Democratic</b> <b>president</b> with <b>a</b> {{conservative}} Congress would have been pretty tolerable in retrospect". He voted for Jack Ryan in the Illinois United States Senate election, 2004 Republican primary.|$|R
5000|$|Rockcastle {{county has}} never voted for <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> {{candidate}} for <b>president</b> except in 1868, 1872, 1876, and 1880.

After serving as Chief of Staff for Governor Wise, Burdette ran The Burdette Group, a West Virginia-based government relations and lobbying company., until his appointment as Secretary.|$|R
50|$|Alfred Mahan was <b>a</b> two-term <b>Democratic</b> <b>president</b> from 1889 to 1897.
