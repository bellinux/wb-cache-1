5|$|After Hinde's death, Constable quickly {{gathered}} {{all of his}} writings, diaries, business documents, and miscellaneous {{other items}} and donated them to Lyman Draper in 1864, who was known for collecting the papers of figures of the Trans-Allegheny frontier. Because of this donation, many scholars <b>and</b> <b>historians</b> {{have been able to}} study these papers. The Thomas S. Hinde documents are owned and kept at the Wisconsin Historical Society.|$|E

5|$|Goldman {{was well}} known during her life, {{described}} as—among other things—"the most dangerous woman in America". After her death and through the middle part of the 20th century, her fame faded. Scholars <b>and</b> <b>historians</b> of anarchism viewed her as a great speaker and activist, but did not regard her as a philosophical or theoretical thinker on par with, for instance, Kropotkin.|$|E

His father, Timoléon C. Brutus, was also a prominent politician <b>and</b> <b>historian.</b>|$|R
5|$|Peribsen's {{choice of}} patron, and his rule during the shadowy {{period of the}} mid Second dynasty, led Egyptologists <b>and</b> <b>historians</b> to search for {{possible}} explanations for both his name and the troubled times he lived in. The following sections discuss some of the theories that they put forth.|$|E
5|$|The {{contemporary}} historian Simon Wessley {{describes the}} novel, alongside Barker's Regeneration, as an exemplar of contemporary fiction which uses {{the experience of}} the World War I trenches to examine more contemporary understandings of PTSD. De Groot argues that this reinvestigation of a traumatic history mirrors a growing interest among both literary authors <b>and</b> <b>historians</b> in trauma as a thematic subject.|$|E
5|$|According to the Holy Land Handicraft Cooperative Society, the blowing {{technique}} employed is {{the same}} as was used by the ancient Phoenicians, though archaeologists <b>and</b> <b>historians</b> of glass agree that glassblowing was not common until the last few centuries BCE. Molten glass is withdrawn from a furnace on the end of an iron pipe, which is blown into as a metal tool called a kammasha is used to shape the glass. It is returned to the furnace and reshaped by the same process before being detached from the pipe and placed into a cooling chamber.|$|E
50|$|Marcius D. Raymond (April 8, 1833 - December 15, 1911) was an American publisher, writer, genealogist, editor <b>and</b> <b>historian.</b> A gifted speaker <b>and</b> <b>historian,</b> he {{also contributed}} {{frequently}} {{to a number}} of historical societies in New York and Connecticut.|$|R

5|$|After the war, he {{was tried}} at Nuremberg {{and sentenced to}} 20 {{years in prison for}} his role in the Nazi regime, principally for the use of forced labor. Despite {{repeated}} attempts to gain early release, he served his full sentence, most of it at Spandau Prison in West Berlin. Following his release in 1966, Speer published two bestselling autobiographical works, Inside the Third Reich and , detailing his close personal relationship with Hitler, and providing readers <b>and</b> <b>historians</b> with a unique perspective on the workings of the Nazi regime. He later wrote a third book, Infiltration, about the SS. Speer died of a stroke in 1981 while on a visit to London.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{painting}} met with mixed reactions from art critics <b>and</b> <b>historians.</b> Artists had previously tended to depict {{war in the}} high style of history painting, and Goya's unheroic description was unusual for the time. According to some early critical opinion the painting was flawed technically: the perspective is flat, or the victims and executioners are standing too close together to be realistic. Although these observations may be strictly correct, the writer Richard Schickel argues that Goya was not striving for academic propriety but rather to strengthen the overall impact of the piece.|$|E
5|$|Beauregard's {{decision}} {{was one of}} the most controversial of the Civil War. Numerous veterans <b>and</b> <b>historians</b> have wondered what might have happened if the assault had gone forward into the night. Beauregard believed that the battle was essentially won and his men could finish off Grant in the morning. He knew the terrain to be crossed (a steep ravine containing a creek named Dill Branch) was extremely difficult and Grant's defensive line was heavy with massed artillery and supported by gunboats in the river. Unbeknownst to Beauregard, Buell's Army of the Ohio began arriving that afternoon, and he and Grant launched a massive counterattack on April 7. Overwhelmed, the Confederates retreated to Corinth.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 73 BC, Spartacus and Crixus were {{in command}} of {{a large group of}} armed men with a proven ability to {{withstand}} Roman armies. What they intended to do with this force is somewhat difficult for modern readers to determine. Since the Third Servile War was ultimately an unsuccessful rebellion, no firsthand account of the slaves' motives and goals exists, <b>and</b> <b>historians</b> writing about the war propose contradictory theories.|$|E
5|$|Considered by {{baseball}} insiders <b>and</b> <b>historians</b> as an unlucky pitcher, Warhop had {{a career}} 69–92 win–loss record, but with a 3.12 earned run average while playing for mostly second division Highlanders/Yankees teams. Of his 92 losses, the Yankees did not score a run in 23, and he holds the MLB record for losing the most 1–0 games with five in 1914. He was released after the 1915 season and played a number of seasons in minor league baseball and semi-professional teams until his late 40s or early 50s.|$|E
5|$|Fame of Zamoyski, {{significance}} in life, endured after his death. He was praised by {{artists such as}} Szymon Starowolski and Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, <b>and</b> <b>historians,</b> including Stanisław Staszic, Stanisław Tarnowski and Artur Śliwiński. There were also those critical of him: Hugo Kołłątaj, Józef Szujski, Michał Bobrzyński. Nonetheless, Polish historiography and culture treatment of Zamoyski is mostly positive, and historian Janusz Tazbir remarked that Zamoyski posthumous career was even more magnificent than his real one. Leśniewski, ending his recent biography of Zamoyski, concludes {{that he is a}} significant, if controversial, figure of Polish Renaissance.|$|E

5|$|Following the government's {{closure of}} most of the schools in the 1960s, the work of Indigenous activists <b>and</b> <b>historians</b> led to greater {{awareness}} by the public of the damage the schools had caused, as well as to official government and church apologies, and a legal settlement. These gains were achieved through the persistent organizing and advocacy by Indigenous communities {{to draw attention to the}} residential school system's legacy of abuse, including their participation in hearings of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.|$|E
5|$|In 1800, Adams lost {{re-election}} to Thomas Jefferson {{and retired}} to Massachusetts. He eventually resumed {{his friendship with}} Jefferson upon the latter's own retirement by initiating a correspondence which lasted fourteen years. He and his wife established a family of politicians, diplomats, <b>and</b> <b>historians</b> now {{referred to as the}} Adams political family. Adams was the father of John Quincy Adams, the sixth President of the United States. He died on the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, and the same day as Jefferson. Modern historians in the aggregate have favorably ranked his administration.|$|E
