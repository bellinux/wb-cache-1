50|$|Henequen (<b>Agave</b> <b>fourcroydes</b> Lem.) is an agave, a {{plant species}} native to {{southern}} Mexico and Guatemala. It is reportedly naturalized in Italy, the Canary Islands, Costa Rica, Cuba, Hispaniola, the Cayman Islands and the Lesser Antilles.|$|E
50|$|The Yucatan bobwhite is {{native to}} Central America where its range extends from the Yucatan Peninsula southwards to Honduras and Nicaragua. Its typical habitat is clearings in forests, pine savannah, rough grassland, weedy fields and {{plantations}} of henequen (<b>Agave</b> <b>fourcroydes).</b>|$|E
50|$|The English term agave {{was known}} in the Mayan {{languages}} as ki. Henequen (<b>Agave</b> <b>fourcroydes)</b> {{was referred to as}} henequen blanco by the Spaniards and sakki by the Mayan, while sisal (Agave sisalana,) was henequen verde to the Spaniards and yaxqui to the Maya.|$|E
50|$|The native {{origin of}} Agave sisalana is uncertain. Traditionally it was {{deemed to be}} {{a native of the}} Yucatán Peninsula, but there are no records of botanical {{collections}} from there. They were originally shipped from the Spanish colonial port of Sisal in Yucatán (thus the name). The Yucatán plantations now cultivate henequen (<b>Agave</b> <b>fourcroydes).</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{leaves of}} <b>Agave</b> <b>fourcroydes</b> yield a fiber also called henequen, which is {{suitable}} for rope and twine but not of as high a quality as sisal. Alternative spellings are Henequin and Heniquen. It is the major plantation fiber agave of eastern Mexico, being grown extensively in Yucatán, Veracruz, and southern Tamaulipas. It {{is also used to}} make licor del henequén, a traditional Mexican alcoholic drink.|$|E
30|$|Some {{studies have}} {{characterized}} the female gametophyte of different species {{belonging to the}} Asparagaceae family formerly Agavaceae (APG III 2009), {{where the majority of}} them have been described as Monosporic Polygonum-type. Among these species, Yucca rupicola (Watkins 1937); Y. aloifolia (Wolf 1940); Y. filamentosa (Reed 1903); Agave lechuguilla (Grove 1941), A. virginica (Regen 1941), Hesperocallis undulata, Leucocrinum montanum (Cave 1948) and Comospermum yedoense (Rudall 1999) are found. However, Piven et al. (2001) reported the embryo sac development of <b>Agave</b> <b>fourcroydes</b> and A. angustifolia as bisporic Allium-type.|$|E
40|$|The current {{research}} {{was carried out}} {{with the objective of}} evaluating the radiosensitivity of shoot tips from henequen (<b>Agave</b> <b>fourcroydes)</b> to gamma radiations 60 Co and to determine the optimum dose of radiation for breeding program in the cultivar Sac Ki. Shoot tips of 20 days of in vitro culture were selected and irradiated with five doses between 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 Gy using a 60 Co source. Evaluations were aimed to determine increasing of fresh weight of explants in relation to the control (no irradiated material), number of dead explants and average number of axillary shoots per explants. Percentage of mortality was bigger when irradiation dose was increased. Irradiation 20 dose of Gy was GR 50, increasing fresh weight of explants in a 49. 6 % in relation to control. LD 50 was 30 Gy and a 50 % of irradiated explants died. When increasing irradiation dose the number of explants decreased, though starting of sprouting took place after 90 for both, irradiated and non irradiated explants, suggesting that this parameter was not radiostimulated nor radioinhibited. Results enable to suggest the application of 20 Gy in studies aimed to create genetic variability in breeding programs by mutation induction.

30|$|In Agave tequilana, {{only the}} closest {{megaspore}} cell to the chalazal pole remains viable (Monosporic-type) becoming the functional megaspore (FM). This {{is the case}} of most angiosperms including Arabidopsis thaliana and Zea mays (Yang et al. 2010) and the close related species Agave virginica (Regen 1941) and Yucca aloifolia (Wolf 1940). However, this megaspore is not always the one that survives, Reed (1903) reported that is the second closest megaspore the one that remains viable and is converted to a FM in Y. filamentosa. On the other hand, Piven et al. (2001) observed that the embryo sac of <b>Agave</b> <b>fourcroydes</b> and A. angustifolia develops from the two megaspores closest to the micropylar pole originating an embryo sac of the bisporic Allium-type.|$|E
40|$|A {{histological}} {{study of}} the structures embryogenic formed from meristem of <b>Agave</b> <b>fourcroydes,</b> {{with the objective of}} observing the behavior of the somatic embryogenesis from the induction until the formation of the embryo was carried out.

40|$|A {{research}} was realized {{in order to}} determine the effect of copper on henequen (<b>Agave</b> <b>fourcroydes</b> L.) var. `Sac ki' in vitro plants. CuSO 4 (25, 50, 75, 100 µM) was added to the culture medium. After 30 days of the in vitro plants established, the following indicators were determined: biomass production, soluble carbohydrates, reducing sugars, soluble proteins, specific activity of catalase and peroxidase enzymes and number of shoots. No phenotypic abnormalities or toxicity symptoms were observed in plants. Biomass showed an increase at the concentration of 50 µM also as the number of shoots at 25 µM. It was proven that the effect on the evaluated indicators was related to the concentration of copper and indicated the tolerance to copper. The results of this investigation settle down the bases for the possible use of this specie in bioremediation of contaminated soils.   Keywords: bioremediation, heavy metals, phytoremediatio...|$|E
40|$|The use of meristematic apice {{of plant}} is {{reported}} for callus formation with embryogenic structures in henequen. Sac Ki cultivated variants of henequen from the Matanzas enterprise germoplasm was used. The embryogenic potencial of three explant (shoop top; leaf blade from in vitro plants; inflorecense bud) under differents iluminated conditions and six rates (0; 0. 56; 1. 12; 1. 68; 2. 24; 2. 81 µmol. l- 1). of two auxins (2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacético acid and Dicamba) was tested. Evaluations after second subculture (60 day) were carried out. Stadistical differences within evaluated explants {{and rates of}} auxins were found. It was possible to select meristematic apice, 1. 12 mmol. l- 1 of 2, 4 -D as the best explant, rate and auxin for the establishment by the first time of the somatic embryogenesis of henequén (<b>Agave</b> <b>fourcroydes</b> Lem).

30|$|Most of {{the studies}} on the {{embryogenesis}} of Asparagaceae describe the embryo sac development as of the Monosporic–Polygonum type such as in Yucca rupicola (Watkins 1937), Yucca aloifolia (Wolf 1940), Agave lechuguilla (Grove 1941), Agave virginica (Regen 1941), Hesperocallis undulata and Leucocrinum montanum (Cave 1948), Comospermum yedoense (Rudall 1999), Agave tequilana (Escobar-Guzmán et al. 2008; González-Gutiérrez et al. 2014), Yucca elephantipes (Cruz-Cruz 2013) and Yucca filamentosa (Reed 1903), being the exception <b>Agave</b> <b>fourcroydes</b> and Agave angustifolia (Piven et al. 2001) in which the embryo sac was reported as bisporic of the Allium type. Knowledge about embryo and endosperm development in the sub-family Agavaoideae is limited. In 1941 Regen described the endosperm of A. virginica as of the nuclear type, while Gonzalez-Gutiérrez et al. (2014) reported the endosperm of A. tequilana as of the helobial type. However, reports about female gametophyte development, fertilization and embryo development in the genus Polianthes specifically in the species P. tuberosa are not available.|$|E
40|$|The {{henequen}} (<b>Agave</b> <b>fourcroydes</b> Lem.) is a crop {{of great}} economic importance. This study was aimed to characterize the leaf surface of henequen plants variety `Sac Ki' obtained by asexual propagation methods. In vitro plants, shoots of bulbils of in vitro plants, shoots of rhizomes of in vitro plants, shoots of bulbils of field plants and shoots of field rhizomes were used. At 7 and 15 months after planting in the nursery, the epidermis was characterized through the stomatal index and stomatal density. Moreover, the conductor vessels and fiber bundles in leaf mesophyll, were characterized. It {{was found that the}} leaf surface of henequen plants variety `Sac Ki' obtained by different methods of asexual propagation showed similar anatomical structures. However, it was observed that in vitro plants were different from the rest in terms of stomatal index and stomatal density in both time points.

30|$|It was {{observed}} that in Agave tequilana, karyogamy {{of the polar}} nuclei to form the diploid nucleus of the central cell occurred before the process of double fertilization, similar to that observed in ovules of Capsella bursa-pastoris (Schulz 1973) and Tofieldia glutinosa (Holloway and Friedman 2008). This diploid nucleus remained {{at the same place}} where both polar nuclei were observed at the chalazal extreme of the embryo sac. This chalazal position of the central cell nucleus has been observed in Yucca rupicola (Watkins 1937), Persea americana (Tomer and Gottreich 1976) and Tofieldia glutinosa (Holloway and Friedman 2008) among others. However, Piven et al. (2001) reported for <b>Agave</b> <b>fourcroydes</b> and A. angustifolia that the position of the polar nuclei and finally the nucleus of the central cell were located {{in the center of the}} embryo sac; or close to the egg apparatus at the micropylar end, a pattern that is present in almost all angiosperms (Tilton 1978; Russell 1993), particularly in Zea mays (Huang and Sheridan 1994) and in Arabidopsis thaliana (Olsen 2004).|$|E
40|$|The {{henequen}} (<b>Agave</b> <b>fourcroydes</b> Lem.) is a plant {{of a great}} {{economic and}} ecological value. The current technologies used for its micropropagation require a bigger efficiency, due to difficulties that take place, mainly during the multiplication phase. The objective of this work was to achieve the formation of axillary shoots with a reduction of the concentrations of growth regulators {{and a decrease in}} the number of hyperhydric shoots. Shoot tips of henequen established in vitro for 35 days were used to induce the formation of axillary shoots. The influence of different agar concentrations and the use of different combinations of plant growth regulators (IBA, TDZ and 6 -BAP) were tested to 45 days. The highest efficient in the axillary shoot multiplication and minimal occurrence of hyperhydricity of the plants during the process were achieved in the culture medium with 1. 0 mg. l- 1 of IBA, 1. 0 mg. l- 1 of 6 -BAP, 0. 5 mg. l- 1 of TDZ and hardened with 8. 0 g. l- 1 of agar.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{micropropagation}} is {{a powerful}} tool to scale up plants of economical and agronomical importance, enhancing crop productivity. However, {{a small but growing}} body of evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, can be affected under the in vitro conditions characteristic of micropropagation. Here, we tested whether the adaptation to different in vitro systems (Magenta boxes and Bioreactors) modified epigenetically different clones of <b>Agave</b> <b>fourcroydes</b> and A. angustifolia. Furthermore, we assessed whether these epigenetic changes affect the regulatory expression of KNOTTED 1 -like HOMEOBOX (KNOX) transcription factors. Results To {{gain a better understanding of}} epigenetic changes during in vitro and ex vitro conditions in <b>Agave</b> <b>fourcroydes</b> and A. angustifolia, we analyzed global DNA methylation, as well as different histone modification marks, in two different systems: semisolid in Magenta boxes (M) and temporary immersion in modular Bioreactors (B). No significant difference was found in DNA methylation in A. fourcroydes grown in either M or B. However, when A. fourcroydes was compared with A. angustifolia, there was a two-fold difference in DNA methylation between the species, independent of the in vitro system used. Furthermore, we detected an absence or a low amount of the repressive mark H 3 K 9 me 2 in ex vitro conditions in plants that were cultured earlier either in M or B. Moreover, the expression of AtqKNOX 1 and AtqKNOX 2, on A. fourcroydes and A. angustifolia clones, is affected during in vitro conditions. Therefore, we used Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) to know whether these genes were epigenetically regulated. In the case of AtqKNOX 1, the H 3 K 4 me 3 and H 3 K 9 me 2 were affected during in vitro conditions in comparison with AtqKNOX 2. Conclusions Agave clones plants with higher DNA methylation during in vitro conditions were better adapted to ex vitro conditions. In addition, A. fourcroydes and A. angustifolia clones displayed differential expression of the KNOX 1 gene during in vitro conditions, which is epigenetically regulated by the H 3 K 4 me 3 and H 3 K 9 me 2 marks. The finding of an epigenetic regulation in key developmental genes will make it important in future studies to identify factors that help to find climate-resistant micropropagated plants. </p...|$|E
40|$|Henequen (<b>Agave</b> <b>fourcroydes</b> Lem.) is a {{representative}} crop {{of the province}} of Matanzas, Cuba, which has been exploited extensively {{for the quality of}} its fibers. The present work aimed to characterize from the biochemical and histological point of view henequen plants cv. 'Sac Ki' in vitro acclimatized. The biochemical indicators analyzed were concentration of soluble phenols, total soluble carbohydrates, reducing sugars, soluble proteins and total chlorophylls, as well as the relative contents of flavonoids, terpins and anthocyanins. In addition, a histological analysis of the epidermis was performed and the results were compared with plants of one month in rooting culture medium. In vitro acclimatized plants were subsequently transferred to the ex vitro conditions. The contents of total soluble carbohydrates, reducing sugars and chlorophylls decreased, whereas the levels of soluble phenols, proteins and secondary metabolites were higher in relation to in vitro plants rooted for 30 days. The epidermis of the in vitro acclimatized plants showed a greater development of the stomatal apparatus that could positively affect the ex vitro acclimatization, where a survival rate of 87 % and a reduction of the acclimatization time were obtained.   Keywords: chlorophyll, henequen, phenol, reducing suga...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} during 15 months under nursery conditions, with the objective to evaluate the effect {{of different types of}} seed (in vitro grown plants (V), bulbils of in vitro plants (BV), rhizomes of in vitro plants (RV), bulblets of field plants (BPC) and rhizomes of field plants (RPC) in the propagation of the henequen (<b>Agave</b> <b>fourcroydes</b> Lem.) over indicators related to the growth in the nursery. The indicators evaluated were: plant height, number of leaves, leaf area, daytime oscillation of the titratable acidity, soluble carbohydrates and reducing sugars content. The results indicate that despite of not showing significant differences in height between BPCs and postures derived from in vitro plants (RV and BV), the latter reached a greater development due to their bigger capacity to accumulate and consume titratable acid and to achieve superior content of reducing sugars and total soluble carbohydrates. It was demostrated that the height is influenced by the type of seed that is used in the henequen propagation of moreover the physiological and biochemical indicators related to the development suggest that postures derived from in vitro plants (RV e BV) showed a better response to the biological efficiency.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the bonding between {{henequen}} fibers (<b>Agave</b> <b>fourcroydes)</b> and High Density Polyethylene (HDPE), they were treated in an ethylene-dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma operating at atmospheric pressure. A 23 factorial experimental design was used to {{study the effects of}} the plasma operational parameters, namely, frequency, flow rate and exposure time, over the fiber tensile mechanical properties and its adhesion to HDPE. The fiber-matrix Interfacial Shear Strength (IFSS) was evaluated by means of the single fiber pull-out test. The fiber surface chemical changes were assessed by photoacoustic Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (PAS-FTIR) and the changes in surface morphology with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results indicate that individual operational parameters in the DBD plasma treatment have different effects on the tensile properties of the henequen fibers and on its bonding to HDPE. The SEM results show that the plasma treatment increased the roughness of the fiber surface. The FTIR result seems to indicate the presence of a hydrocarbon-like polymer film, bearing some vinyl groups deposited onto the fibers. These suggests that the improvement in the henequen-HDPE bonding could be the result of the enhancement of the mechanical interlocking, due the increment in roughness, and the possible reaction of the vinyl groups on the film deposited onto the fiber with the HDPE...|$|E
40|$|Long chain {{aliphatic}} alcohols {{have been used}} as model compounds to develop a preparative method for a water-soluble material, which could be a carrier for triacontanol, a highly hydrophobic plant growth regulator. New polyesters from long chain aliphatic (C = 12, 18 and 22) mono- 1 -alkyl citrates and poly(ethylene glycol) were synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy. The polyester containing the triacontyl moiety was obtained from mono- 1 -triacontyl citrate, which was synthesized from the corresponding alcohol extracted from the <b>Agave</b> <b>fourcroydes.</b> The molecular weight Mn of the polyesters depends on experimental conditions during synthesis such as reaction time, atmosphere, catalyst concentration and temperature. The reaction is second order in the early stage of the polyester synthesis. The reaction rate constant is independent of the length of the aliphatic chain, but it decreases with increasing Mn of the poly(ethylene glycol) employed. Turbidity measurements have been used to study the polyester solubility. Solubility characteristics were found to depend on the Mn of poly(ethylene glycol), the aliphatic-chain length and the value of Xn for the polyester. These preparations could potentially be used to release triacontanol. The authors thank the Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD) for a provision of a Ph.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} <b>Agave</b> <b>fourcroydes</b> powder as a dietary supplement on the growth performance, gut morphology, serum concentration of IgG, and the hematology parameters of broiler rabbits. A total of 32 rabbits [New Zealand × Californian] were weaned at 35 days. They were randomly selected for two dietary treatments (eight repetitions per treatment), which consisted of a basal diet and a basal diet supplemented with 1. 5 % dried-stem powder of A. fourcroydes. On day 60 from the initiation of treatment, gut histomorphology (duodenum and cecum), serum concentration of IgG, and hematology parameters were all measured. The results showed that A. fourcroydes powder supplementation improved (P< 0. 05) the ADFI, ADG, and final BW. Correspondingly, this treatment increased (P< 0. 05) the muscle and mucosa thickness and height and width of villi. However, duodenum crypts depth was lower (P< 0. 05) when rabbits were fed with this natural product, compared with the basal diet treatment. Results also indicated that the A. fourcroydes powder increased (P< 0. 05) the serum concentration of IgG but did not change the hematology parameters. This data indicates that A. fourcroydes powder, as a supplement, had beneficial effects on increasing the growth performance and serum concentration of IgG, as well as improving the gut morphology without affecting the hematology parameters in broiler rabbits...|$|E
40|$|High {{microbial}} contamination on henequen (<b>Agave</b> <b>fourcroydes</b> Lem) in vitro propagation reduces its efficiency. This work aimed {{to determine the}} effect of the use of antibiotics in the control of bacterial contaminants of this culture. Bacterial contaminants were identified and their susceptibility to different antibiotics it were determined. The two best-acting antibiotics were added to the propagation medium and the number of explants contaminated with bacteria and necrotics was quantified. The antibiotic and concentration that did not cause phytotoxicity to the explants and where the lowest percentage of contamination was obtained it was used to continue the propagation of the plants. These were transferred to the acclimatization stage and at 30 days of culture the number of live plants and the number of roots per plant were quantified. In addition, the length of the roots (cm) was measured and the leaf area was calculated. Micrococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Agrobacterium spp., Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis were found. The antibiotics tested inhibited the in vitro growth of the isolated contaminants and the best results were obtained with Ticar and Cefotaxime. Added to the plant propagation medium, Ticar was phytotoxic over 50 mg l- 1 and cefotaxime could be used at 100 mg l- 1 without causing damage to the explants. The results showed that the plants that came from the culture medium with cefotaxime 100 mg l- 1 showed a significant increase of the variables evaluated in the acclimatization stage.   Key words: betalactamic, henequen, micropropagatio...|$|E
