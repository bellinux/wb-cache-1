By extension, the sacrifice of <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>life</b> was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice. Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.|$|E
25|$|Abortion: Badnarik {{personally}} opposes abortion, but {{believes that}} decisions regarding abortion rights {{should be made}} {{at the state and}} not the federal level. He recognizes that there is significant controversy surrounding when life begins, and argues that therefore the state should not legislate against abortion, since a fetus is arguably not <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>life</b> in and of its own.|$|E
25|$|The Buddhist {{cosmology}} places Indra above Mount Sumeru, in Trayastrimsha heaven. He resides {{and rules}} {{over one of}} the six realms of rebirth, the Devas realm of Saṃsāra, that is widely sought in the Buddhist tradition. Rebirth in the realm of Indra is a consequence of very good Karma (Pali: kamma) and accumulated merit during <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E

This is symmetrical with the dealth of <b>an</b> existing <b>human</b> <b>life,</b> which occurs when its organs and systems have permanently ceased to function as a whole. Thus <b>a</b> new <b>human</b> <b>life</b> cannot begin until the development of a functioning brain which has begun to co-ordinate and organise the activities of the body as a whole...|$|R

I argue that unconditional and unchosen love is an essential component of <b>a</b> good <b>human</b> <b>life,</b> and while we can get this by having children, we can also get it in other ways...|$|R

25|$|In one context, brahmacharya is {{the first}} of four ashrama (age-based stages) of <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>life,</b> with grihastha (householder), vanaprastha (forest dweller), and sannyasa (renunciation) being the other three asramas. The brahmacharya (bachelor student) stage of one's life, up to twenty-five years of age, was focused on {{education}} and included the practice of celibacy. In this context, it connotes chastity during the student stage of life for the purposes of learning from a guru (teacher), and during later stages of life for the purposes of attaining spiritual liberation (moksha).|$|E

The concept of life being in danger is interpreted broadly: for example, it is mandated that one violate Shabbat to bring a woman in active labor to a hospital. Lesser rabbinic restrictions are often violated under much less urgent circumstances (a patient who is ill but not critically so).|$|E

25|$|The poem is twelve {{books with}} the first six dealing with various episodes along with {{introducing}} Hindu theology. The story describes Kehama, a Brahmin priest, as he makes sacrifices to Shiva to gain power. His scheme is to conquer death and attain Amreeta to become a god himself. Arvalan, Kehama's son, attempts to take Kailyal, a peasant girl. He is stopped by Ladurlad, another peasant, and killed. Kehama decides to war against Yamen, the god of death while also seeking to torture Ladurlad in revenge. Ladurlad is cursed {{to be separated from}} nature and unable to live <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>life,</b> which included not being able to sleep. His separation from nature gives him the ability to do what others cannot however.|$|E
25|$|Sacrificial rituals {{among the}} Aztecs and in Mesoamerica, in general, {{must be seen}} in the context of {{religious}} cosmology: sacrifice and death was necessary for the continued existence of the world. Likewise, each part of life had one or more deities associated with it and these had to be paid their dues in order to achieve success. Gods were paid with sacrificial offerings of food, flowers, effigies, and quail. But the larger the effort required of the god, the greater the sacrifice had to be. Blood-fed the gods and kept the sun from falling. For {{some of the most important}} rites, a priest would offer his own blood, by cutting his ears, arms, tongue, thighs, chest or genitals, or offer <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>life</b> or even a god's life. The people who were sacrificed came from many segments of society, and might be a war captive, slave, or a member of Aztec society; the sacrifice might also be man or woman, adult or child, noble or commoner.|$|E

500|$|In Italy, Skirth made a {{resolution}} {{that he would do}} everything within his power to avoid further loss of human life. [...] He felt that the [...] "just war" [...] he had signed up for was anything but just, and was disillusioned with the army and the conduct of the war. [...] In a church in the Italian village of San Martino, near Vicenza, he made a private pact with God that he would never again help to take <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>life.</b> [...] He wrote to his future wife, Ella Christian, claiming that he had become a pacifist and a conscientious objector. [...] He also began a campaign of small acts of sabotage, introducing minor errors into his trajectory calculations so as to mistarget the guns, such that they [...] "never once hit an inhabited target" [...] on the first attempt, giving the enemy a chance to evacuate. His actions were never discovered by his superiors.|$|E
500|$|The {{plot was}} adapted from Augusta Jane Evans's 1867 novel St. Elmo. The actual {{production}} was greatly shortened {{for the purposes of}} conveying the plot of the film. The synopsis in The Moving Picture World states: [...] "St. Elmo, a wealthy young man, is betrothed to his cousin Agnes. Dick Hammond, St. Elmo's chum, is studying for the ministry. As soon as he is ordained he is to take charge of a church built for him by St. Elmo. Hammond, however, takes St. Elmo's friendship lightly and makes love to Agnes in secret. The affair is discovered by St. Elmo, who, in a rage at Hammond's perfidy, challenges him to a duel. The false friend loses his life in the ensuing combat. Edna, the granddaughter of the village blacksmith, strays upon the scene of the duel, an uninvited witness. St. Elmo is forced to flee the country. He is pursued by Agnes and the sheriff. Edna tells her first lie when she deceives St. Elmo's pursuers as to his direction and leads them completely off the trail. St. Elmo makes good his escape. On the day that Edna witnesses the duel her grandfather dies, leaving her alone in the world. She is adopted by St. Elmo's mother. Five years later the fugitive returns. Edna recognizes him as the victor of the dual but he does not remember having met her. He discovers that he loves the girl. Edna rejects his suit, declaring that she never would marry a man who had taken <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>life.</b> In desperation, St. Elmo attempts suicide, choosing as a spot the grave of Dick Hammond, but is swerved from his purpose by Edna, who relents and promises him her love and sympathy. St. Elmo decides that life is worth living if but for her sake." ...|$|E

These findings reveal a novel neural mechanism by which aging may disrupt rational financial choice...|$|R
