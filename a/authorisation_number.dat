50|$|The PAL {{establishes}} {{labelling requirements}} for all items under its purview, {{requiring them to}} display an <b>authorisation</b> <b>number,</b> expiration date, usage instructions, {{and a list of}} side effects. Such items are not limited to ingested medicines, but include other items such as condoms and face masks. The Department of Health is tasked with inspections to ensure compliance with the law; private organisations such as the Consumers' Foundation have also been known to carry out clandestine checks. A February 2007 check of sex shops found that 18 out of 25 condom brands did not label their ingredients clearly or at all, while 22 gave an incorrect <b>authorisation</b> <b>number</b> or none at all. A 2009 survey, also by the Consumers' Foundation, looked at 41 face masks (17 N95 masks and 24 surgical masks), and found that 90% did not meet the labelling and packaging requirements.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Fatigue is a {{frequent}} and troublesome manifestation of chronic sarcoidosis. This symptom can be debilitating and difficult to treat, with poor response to the treatment. Symptomatic management with neurostimulants, such as methylphenidate, is a possible treatment option. The use of such treatment strategies is not without precedent and has been trialled in cancer-related fatigue. Their use in sarcoidosis requires further evaluation {{before it can be}} recommended for clinical practice. Methods and analysis: The Fatigue and Sarcoidosis—Treatment with Methylphenidate study is a randomised, controlled, parallel-arm and feasibility trial of methylphenidate for the treatment of sarcoidosis-associated fatigue. Patients are eligible if they have a diagnosis of sarcoidosis, significant fatigue (measured using the Fatigue Assessment Scale) and have stable disease. Up to 30 participants will be randomly assigned to either methylphenidate (20 mg two times per day) or identical placebo in a 3 : 2 ratio for 24 weeks. The primary objective is to collect data determining the feasibility of a future study powered to determine the clinical efficacy of methylphenidate for sarcoidosis-associated fatigue. The trial is presently open and will continue until July 2018. Ethics and dissemination: Ethical approval for the study was granted by the Cambridge Central Research Ethics Committee on 21 June 2016 (reference 16 /EE/ 0087) and was approved and sponsored by the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital (reference 190280). Clinical Trial <b>Authorisation</b> (EudraCT <b>number</b> 2016 - 000342 - 60) from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) was granted on 19 April 2016. Results will be presented at relevant conferences and submitted to appropriate journals following trial closure and analysis...|$|R

40|$|Page R- 4 - 10 New code {{added to}} BGM- 71 F = {{instruction}} that box contains ‘remaindered ’ items: use only for “green box ” messages R. 4. 1 PRINCIPLES RETINS messages for returns authorisation are sent {{only from a}} supplier to a customer, and only {{in response to a}} designated RETANN message from the customer. A RETANN message may be answered by one or more RETINS messages, which are referred to as “green box ” and “red box ” messages. A “green box ” message lists items which the supplier authorises the customer to return for stock or to return as title pages only, together with any items on which return authorisation is denied. The “green box ” message carries a Returns <b>Authorisation</b> <b>Number</b> (RAN) in BGM segment 2, DE 1004, which must appear on the consignment which the customer sends to the supplier. In rare cases, a single supplier with two or more warehouse locations may require returns for stock to be sent separately to different locations. In this event, a separate “green box ” message would be sent for each location, each with a separate RAN, and each listing the return address in a NAD segment; but only one “green box ” message would list items for which authorisation is denied...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a quantified method for determining the mental workload imposed on train control officers (TCOs) and to express this mental workload by means of an index that is objective and can stand up to the tests of validity and reliability. The method addresses an existing operational shortcoming in Spoornet train control operations and could be used as a tool for predicting the mental workload imposed on operators at particular train control centres. The method could be applied to manage and improve operational safety in the rail transport environment. A participative systems approach was followed in the development of the measuring methodology. A work group comprising expert users of the specific train control system was involved in identifying task factors and assigning weights for task and moderating factors. The newly developed Mental Workload Index (MWLI) consists of three task factors and eleven moderating factors, each with a different weight in terms of its contribution to overall mental workload. The work group performed several iterations to reach final consensus on the following task factors and their respective contributions to the MWLI: the number of data transactions, the <b>number</b> of <b>authorisations,</b> and the <b>number</b> of communications via telephone and radio. The systems approach used in the development process is discussed, and the final index with the task and moderating factors is presented. In conclusion, the value and possible application of the MWLI are discussed. The MWLI is shown to provide an objective method for the assessment and prediction of mental workload in the train control environment. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.
