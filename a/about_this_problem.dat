25|$|The immanence of the Trinity {{that was}} {{defined in the}} {{finalized}} Nicene Creed. The economy of God, as God expresses himself in reality (his energies) was not what the Creed addressed directly. The specifics of God's interrelationships of his existences, are not defined within the Nicene Creed. The attempt to use the Creed to explain God's energies by reducing God existences to mere energies (actualities, activities, potentials) could be perceived as the heresy of semi-Sabellianism by advocates of Personalism, according to Meyendorff. Eastern Orthodox theologians have complained <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> in the Roman Catholic dogmatic teaching of actus purus.|$|E
25|$|Before the Hatlestad Slide, Norway {{maintained}} a liberal policy {{when it came}} to housing construction on hills. The area of the afflicted housing units were therefore not surveyed for landslide risk before construction was commenced in the sixties, and the risk of landslides did not become known until later. After construction was finished, there were several incidents of rocks dislodging from the cliff and hitting the road. The rocks did not cause material damage or personal injury, and the municipality took no action besides setting up a warning sign by the road. Despite repeated complaints from Hatlestad's residents <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> and the general risk of landslides, the municipality did not secure the area, stating that securing land against landslides {{is the responsibility of the}} property owner. However, an order given to the property owners to secure the hill were never responded to, and the case was never resolved.|$|E

This generated complaints from North American customers who had circumvented their Steam end-user license agreement by purchasing The Orange Box through cheaper, Asian retailers. Some customers who then purchased the game a second time from a local vendor experienced difficulty adding the new CD key to their accounts in order to activate their newly purchased games and also had trouble communicating with Steam's customer support team <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem.</b> Doug Lombardi of Valve stated, [...] "Some of these users have subsequently purchased a legal copy after realizing the issue and were having difficulty removing the illegitimate keys from their Steam accounts. Anyone having this problem should contact Steam Support to have the Thai key removed from their Steam account." ...|$|E

[...] Tipper Gore, a founder of the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), who a year earlier denounced Madonna for the sexual lyrical content of her single [...] "Dress You Up", and had led a campaign against explicit content in music, commended Madonna for speaking candidly about such a serious subject and important social issue. When speaking of the song, Gore said [...] "the song speaks to a serious subject with a sense of urgency and sensitivity in both the lyrics and Madonna's rendition. It also speaks to the fact that there's got to be more support and more communication in families <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem,</b> and anything that fosters that I applaud." ...|$|E
