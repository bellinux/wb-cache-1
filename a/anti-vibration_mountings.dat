5000|$|The {{ship was}} built by Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers, Kolkata, {{launched}} in May 1991, and commissioned in 1994. It is similar in design to the Sandhayak-class survey ships, but with the superstructure positioned amidships and a helipad forward. The vessel is designed to facilitate low noise and low vibration while carrying out acoustic programmes. It has floating floors for scientific laboratories, <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>mountings</b> for machinery and equipment, balloon launching container and wind weather radar to carry out those experiments. It is also equipped with VHF sets, marine radio and auto telephone exchange.|$|E
50|$|That {{seemingly}} slow rate of advances {{was often}} paced by {{the progress of}} other inventions, such as the laser, the digital computer, circuit miniaturization, and compact data storage. Once the laser appeared, optical data processing became a fast process because it provided many parallel analog channels, but devising optical chains suited to matching signal focal lengths to ranges proceeded by many stages and turned out to call for some novel optical components. Since the process depended on diffraction of light waves, it required <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>mountings,</b> clean rooms, and highly trained operators. Even at its best, its use of CRTs and film for data storage placed limits on the range depth of images.|$|E
50|$|From his mid-teens Page had ambitions {{to design}} aircraft, {{but it was}} not a dream of the marvels of flight that {{motivated}} him, instead it was the recognition that aircraft design was the most rapidly advancing ofall the branches of engineering and therefore a field in which new things could he created. After graduating in 1938 he joined Hawker Aircraft at Kingston upon Thames working under Sydney Camm. As his career at Hawkers developed he was increasingly asked to help solve difficult problems. The Typhoon was subject to severe propeller-induced vibration and to counter this Page developed <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>mountings</b> for the engine and a sprung seat for the pilot. But it was in the aerodynamics and control of the Tempest that he made major contributions.|$|E

5000|$|... 1929 {{saw another}} {{milestone}} when company boss Marius Daste, working {{in collaboration with}} his new business partner Robert de Prandière, developed and patented a flexible metal-reinforced car-body structure, employing the [...] "Silentbloc" [...] rubber <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>mountings</b> and joints manufactured by a neighbouring firm called [...] "Repusseau and company" [...] ("Repusseau et cie."). These were used to connect the massive steel ladder format chassis of the luxury cars of the time to the Vanvooren timber frames of the car bodies, and successfully eliminated the unavoidable squeaks and rattles that had hitherto been a feature of large coach-built cars. They also removed the risk of timber bodies becoming torn in response to excessive flexing from the steel chassis {{to which they were}} attached.|$|E
5000|$|Of the British {{manufacturers}} themselves, Triumph motorcycles, {{built at}} Meriden, {{were used by}} many British (including the Metropolitan Police) and Commonwealth police forces until 1983 when the factory closed. From the late 1940s, Triumph was also, for a time, {{the choice of the}} Parisian police, a fact promoted in a factory-produced movie, It's A Triumph !. The police version of the 650cc 6T Triumph Thunderbird was nicknamed the SAINT, an acronym of [...] "Stops Anything In No Time". By the mid-1970s, with industrial problems and closures affecting their spares supply and service, Triumphs and other British marques were increasingly replaced by the smoother BMW R80 (and to a more limited extent, Norton Interpols) than by then-current Triumph police bikes. In an attempt to win back orders from BMW, Meriden marketed Triumph Bonneville and Tiger models of 750cc size with <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>mountings</b> as well as electric starting but these still only achieved limited sales success. In 1981, the UK newspaper, Motor Cycle News, reported Derbyshire's Chief Constable comparing these Triumphs very unfavorably to BMW, in particular, its anti-vibration engine mounts. Supported by an article in rival publication, Motor Cycle Weekly, this criticism was strongly refuted by the factory and Derbyshire eventually accepted evaluation of police versions of the new Triumph T140W TSS in anti-vibration mounts.Norton's Commando Interpol [...] and later Wankel rotary engine Interpol 2 motorcycle were used by some British forces until that firm's collapse in the early 1990s. Other marques such as BSA were used by some forces although only the Velocette LE 'noddy-bike' model proved as popular with the police as the Triumphs.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper investigates a novel design {{approach}} for a vibration isolator {{for use in}} space structures. The approach used can particularly be applicable for aerospace structures that support high precision instrumentation such as satellite payloads. The isolator is a space-frame structure that is folded in on itself {{to act as a}} mechanical filter over a defined frequency range. The absence of viscoelastic elements in such a mounting makes the design suitable for use in a vacuum and in high temperature or harsh environments with no risk of drift in alignment of the structure. The design uses a genetic algorithm based geometric optimisation routine to maximise passive vibration isolation, and this is hybridised with a geometric feasibility search. To complement the passive isolation system, an active system is incorporated in the design to add damping. Experimental work to validate the feasibility of the approach is also presented, with the active/passive structure achieving transmissibility of about 19 dB over a range of 1 – 250 Hz. It is shown here that the use of these novel <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>mountings</b> has no or little consequent weight and cost penalties whilst maintaining their effectiveness with the vibration levels. The approach should pave the way for the design of <b>anti-vibration</b> <b>mountings</b> that can be used between most pieces of equipment and their supporting structure...|$|E
