5|$|A {{number of}} new {{medications}} are under study for treating gout, including anakinra, canakinumab and rilonacept. Canakinumab may result in better outcomes than a low dose of a steroid but costs five thousand times more. A recombinant uricase enzyme (rasburicase) is available; its use, however, is limited, as it triggers <b>an</b> <b>immune</b> response. Less antigenic versions are in development.|$|E

5|$|Often, once an {{antibody}} and antigen bind, {{they become}} <b>an</b> <b>immune</b> complex, which {{functions as a}} unitary object and can act as an antigen in its own right, being countered by other antibodies. Similarly, haptens are small molecules that provoke no immune response by themselves, but once they bind to proteins, the resulting complex or hapten-carrier adduct is antigenic.|$|E
5|$|The fungal {{hypotheses}} is also {{compatible with}} some other established AD hypotheses, like the amyloid hypothesis, that can be explained as <b>an</b> <b>immune</b> system response to an infection in the CNS, as found by R. Moir and R. Tanzi in mouse and worm models of AD.|$|E
5|$|Viral {{infections in}} animals provoke <b>an</b> <b>immune</b> {{response}} that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses {{can also be}} produced by vaccines, which confer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection. However, some viruses including those that cause AIDS and viral hepatitis evade these immune responses and result in chronic infections. Antibiotics {{have no effect on}} viruses, but several antiviral drugs have been developed.|$|E

5|$|Apical {{periodontitis}} is acute {{or chronic}} inflammation around {{the apex of}} a tooth caused by <b>an</b> <b>immune</b> response to bacteria within an infected pulp. It does not occur because of pulp necrosis, meaning that a tooth that tests as if it's alive (vital) may cause apical periodontitis, and a pulp which has become non-vital due to a sterile, non-infectious processes (such as trauma) may not cause any apical periodontitis. Bacterial cytotoxins reach the region around {{the roots of the}} tooth via the apical foramina and lateral canals, causing vasodilation, sensitization of nerves, osteolysis (bone resorption) and potentially abscess or cyst formation.|$|E
5|$|As suicide {{requires}} a willful attempt to die, some feel it therefore cannot {{be said to}} occur in non-human animals. Suicidal behavior has been observed in salmonella seeking to overcome competing bacteria by triggering <b>an</b> <b>immune</b> system response against them. Suicidal defenses by workers are also noted in the Brazilian ant Forelius pusillus, where {{a small group of}} ants leaves the security of the nest after sealing the entrance from the outside each evening.|$|E
5|$|Both innate and {{adaptive}} immunity {{depend on the}} ability of the immune system to distinguish between self and non-self molecules. In immunology, self molecules are those components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system. Conversely, non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules. One class of non-self molecules are called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit <b>an</b> <b>immune</b> response.|$|E
50|$|An {{opportunistic}} infection is an infection caused by pathogens (bacteria, viruses, fungi, or protozoa) that {{take advantage of}} an opportunity not normally available, such as a host with <b>a</b> weakened <b>immune</b> system, <b>an</b> altered microbiota (such as a disrupted gut flora), or breached integumentary barriers. Many of these pathogens do not cause disease in a healthy host that has <b>a</b> normal <b>immune</b> system. However, <b>a</b> compromised <b>immune</b> system, <b>a</b> penetrating injury, {{or a lack of}} competition from normal commensals presents an opportunity for the pathogen to infect.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the prevalence and predictors of <b>an</b> incomplete <b>immune</b> response {{in patients with}} sustained viral suppression after starting their first or second combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) regimen. Methods: All patients were recruited to the Australian HIV Observational Database (AHOD) by March 2006. Data were analyzed to assess the prevalence of <b>an</b> incomplete <b>immune</b> response (, 350 cells/mL) in the 12 – 24 months after starting {{the first or second}} cART regimen. Factors associated with <b>an</b> incomplete <b>immune</b> response were assessed using logistic regression and time to AIDS/death was assessed using survival analysis. Results: Of the 2493 patients recruited to AHOD by March 2006, 590 were eligible for the analysis. Twenty-eight percent of patients with a baseline CD 4 count, 350 cells per microliter had <b>an</b> incomplete <b>immune</b> response 12 – 24 months after starting their first or second cART regimen. Lower baseline CD 4 count before starting the cART regimen was predictive of <b>an</b> incomplete <b>immune</b> response. There was a nonsignificant trend toward faster AIDS or death in incomplete immune responders. Conclusions: An incomplete immune response in patients with sustained viral suppression is associated with poorer immune function before starting cART. Type of cART or individual antiretroviral drug was not associated with <b>an</b> incomplete <b>immune</b> response...|$|R

5|$|Hypersensitivity is <b>an</b> <b>immune</b> {{response}} that damages the body's own tissues. They {{are divided into}} four classes (Type I– IV) based on the mechanisms involved and {{the time course of}} the hypersensitive reaction. Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction, often associated with allergy. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death. Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen.|$|E
5|$|Like other animals, fish {{suffer from}} {{diseases}} and parasites. To prevent disease {{they have a}} variety of defenses. Non-specific defenses include the skin and scales, as well as the mucus layer secreted by the epidermis that traps and inhibits the growth of microorganisms. If pathogens breach these defenses, fish can develop an inflammatory response that increases blood flow to the infected region and delivers white blood cells that attempt to destroy pathogens. Specific defenses respond to particular pathogens recognised by the fish's body, i.e., <b>an</b> <b>immune</b> response. In recent years, vaccines have become widely used in aquaculture and also with ornamental fish, for example furunculosis vaccines in farmed salmon and koi herpes virus in koi.|$|E
5|$|Long-term active {{memory is}} {{acquired}} following infection by activation of B and T cells. Active immunity {{can also be}} generated artificially, through vaccination. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate {{the immune system and}} develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. This deliberate induction of <b>an</b> <b>immune</b> response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system, as well as its inducibility. With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed.|$|E

5|$|Severe {{disease is}} marked by the {{problems}} of capillary permeability (an allowance of fluid and protein normally contained within blood to pass) and disordered blood clotting. These changes appear associated with a disordered state of the endothelial glycocalyx, which acts as a molecular filter of blood components. Leaky capillaries (and the critical phase) {{are thought to be}} caused by <b>an</b> <b>immune</b> system response. Other processes of interest include infected cells that become necrotic—which affect both coagulation and fibrinolysis (the opposing systems of blood clotting and clot degradation)—and low platelets in the blood, also a factor in normal clotting.|$|E
5|$|While heparin was {{introduced}} {{for clinical use}} in the late 1930s, new thrombosis in people treated with heparin was not described until 1957, when vascular surgeons reported the association. The fact that this phenomenon occurred together with thrombocytopenia was reported in 1969; prior to this time, platelet counts were not routinely performed. A 1973 report established HIT as a diagnosis, as well as suggesting that its features {{were the result of}} <b>an</b> <b>immune</b> process.|$|E
5|$|While {{the cause}} of Crohn's disease is unknown it is {{believed}} to be due to a combination of environmental, immune and bacterial factors in genetically susceptible individuals. It results in a chronic inflammatory disorder, in which the body's immune system attacks the gastrointestinal tract possibly directed at microbial antigens. While Crohn's is <b>an</b> <b>immune</b> related disease, it {{does not appear to be}} an autoimmune disease (in that the immune system is not being triggered by the body itself). The exact underlying immune problem is not clear; however, it may be an immunodeficiency state. About half of the overall risk is related to genetics with more than 70 genes found to be involved.|$|E

5|$|Dying {{stands of}} B. coccinea were {{observed}} in 1989, and the fungus Cryptodiaporthe melanocraspedia isolated as the cause in 1995. The disease, a form of aerial canker, manifested initially as dead dry brown leaves and the tips of new growth. Plants would die from the top downwards, with larger branches affected over time. Under the outer bark, orange and brown patches of necrosis spread out from leaf nodes until they encircle the stem, which then dies. Flower spikes may be affected during flowering season. In humid spells during warm weather, white or pink spore tendrils are produced on dead wood. One affected stand monitored over three years from October 1989 to June 1992 showed a 97% mortality of plants (compared with a baseline 40%). Investigators Bryan Shearer and colleagues isolated another virulent pathogen that they identified as a species of Zythiostroma, however it appeared to invoke <b>an</b> <b>immune</b> response in the plant. This immune response, coupled {{with the fact that}} it had not been observed in the wild, led them to believe it was not a major pathogen of the species. This species has since been reclassified and named as Luteocirrhus shearii.|$|E
5|$|In {{autoimmunity}} {{the immune}} system wrongly recognizes certain native molecules in the body as foreign (self-antigen), and mounts <b>an</b> <b>immune</b> response against them. Since these native molecules, as normal parts of the body, will naturally always exist in the body, the attacks against them can get stronger over time (akin to secondary immune response). Moreover, many organisms exhibit molecular mimicry, which involves showing those antigens on their surface that are antigenically similar to the host proteins. This has two possible consequences: first, either the organism will be spared as a self antigen; or secondly, that the antibodies produced against it will also bind to the mimicked native proteins. The antibodies will attack the self-antigens and the tissues harboring them by activating various mechanisms like the complement activation and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Hence, wider the range of antibody-specificities, greater the chance that {{one or the other}} will react against self-antigens (native molecules of the body).|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus uses two key {{mechanisms}} {{to evade the}} immune system. First, {{it is capable of}} surviving the highly acidic conditions of the stomach, allowing the virus to infect the host and spread throughout the body via the lymphatic system. Second, because it can replicate very quickly, the virus overwhelms the host organs before <b>an</b> <b>immune</b> response can be mounted. If detail is given at the attachment phase; poliovirus with canyons on the virion surface have virus attachment sites located in pockets at the canyon bases. The canyons are too narrow for access by antibodies, so the virus attachment sites are protected from the host’s immune surveillance, while the remainder of the virion surface can mutate to avoid the host’s immune response.|$|E
