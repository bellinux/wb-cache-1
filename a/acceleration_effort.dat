40|$|Purpose Sprints and {{accelerations}} {{are popular}} performance indicators in applied sport. The {{methods used to}} define these efforts using athlete tracking technology could affect the number of efforts reported. The study aimed to {{determine the influence of}} different techniques and settings for detecting high-intensity efforts using Global Positioning System (GPS) data. Methods Velocity and acceleration data of a professional soccer match was recorded via 10 -Hz GPS. Velocity data was filtered using either a median or exponential filter. Acceleration data was derived from velocity data over a 0. 2 s time interval (with and without an exponential filter applied) and a 0. 3 s time interval. High-speed running (≥ 4. 17 m. s- 1), sprint (≥ 7. 00 m. s- 1) and acceleration (≥ 2. 78 m. s- 2) efforts were then identified using minimum effort durations (0. 1 to 0. 9 s) to assess differences in the total number of efforts reported. Results Different velocity filtering methods resulted in small to moderate differences (Effect Size; 0. 28 - 1. 09) in the number of high-speed running and sprint efforts detected when minimum duration was < 0. 5 s and small to very large differences (ES; - 5. 69 - 0. 26) in the number of accelerations when minimum duration was < 0. 7 s. There was an exponential {{decline in the number of}} all efforts as minimum duration increased, regardless of filtering method, with the largest declines in <b>acceleration</b> <b>efforts.</b> Conclusions Filtering techniques and minimum durations substantially affect the number of high-speed running, sprint and <b>acceleration</b> <b>efforts</b> detected with GPS.

40|$|Acceleration is a {{significant}} feature of game-deciding situations in the various codes of football. However {{little is known about}} the acceleration characteristics of football players, the effects of acceleration training, or the effectiveness of different training modalities. This study examined the effects of resisted sprint (RS) training (weighted sled towing) on acceleration performance (0 - 15 m), leg power (countermovement jump [CMJ], 5 -bound test [5 BT], and 50 -cm drop jump [50 DJ]), gait (foot contact time, stride length, stride frequency, step length, and flight time), and joint (shoulder, elbow, hip, and knee) kinematics in men (N = 30) currently playing soccer, rugby union, or Australian football. Gait and kinematic measurements were derived from the first and second strides of an <b>acceleration</b> <b>effort.</b> Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment conditions: (a) 8 -week sprint training of two 1 -h sessions[middle dot]wk- 1 plus RS training (RS group, n = 10), (b) 8 -week nonresisted sprint training program of two 1 -h sessions[middle dot]wk- 1 (NRS group, n = 10), or (c) control (n = 10). The results indicated that an 8 -week RS training program (a) significantly improves acceleration and leg power (CMJ and 5 BT) performance but is no more effective than an 8 -week NRS training program, (b) significantly improves reactive strength (50 DJ), and (c) has minimal impact on gait and upper- and lower-body kinematics during acceleration performance compared to an 8 -week NRS training program. These findings suggest that RS training will not adversely affect acceleration kinematics and gait. Although apparently no more effective than NRS training, this training modality provides an overload stimulus to acceleration mechanics and recruitment of the hip and knee extensors, resulting in greater application of horizontal power...|$|E
40|$|The {{external}} load of a team-sport athlete {{can be measured}} by tracking technologies, including global positioning systems (GPS), local positioning systems (LPS) and vision-based systems. These technologies allow for the calculation of displacement, velocity and acceleration during a match or training session. The accurate quantification of these variables is critical so that meaningful changes in team-sport athlete {{external load}} can be detected. High-velocity running, including sprinting, may be important for specific team-sport match activities, including evading an opponent or creating a shot on goal. Maximal accelerations are energetically demanding and frequently occur from a low velocity during team-sport matches. Despite extensive research, conjecture exists regarding the thresholds by which to classify the high velocity and acceleration activity of a team-sport athlete. There is currently no consensus on {{the definition of a}} sprint or <b>acceleration</b> <b>effort,</b> even within a single sport. The aim of this narrative review was to examine the varying velocity and acceleration thresholds reported in athlete activity profiling. The purposes of this review were therefore to (1) identify the various thresholds used to classify high-velocity or –intensity running plus accelerations; (2) examine the impact of individualized thresholds on reported team-sport activity profile; (3) evaluate the use of thresholds for court-based team-sports and; (4) discuss potential areas for future research. The presentation of velocity thresholds as a single value, with equivocal qualitative descriptors, is confusing when data lies between two thresholds. In Australian football, sprint efforts have been defined as activity > 4. 00 m·s- 1 or > 4. 17 m·s- 1. Acceleration thresholds differ across the literature, with > 1. 11 m·s- 2, 2. 78 m·s- 2, 3. 00 m·s- 2 and 4. 00 m·s- 2 utilized across a number of sports. It is difficult to compare literature on field-based sports due to inconsistencies in velocity and acceleration thresholds, even within a single sport. Velocity and acceleration thresholds have been determined from physical capacity tests. Limited research exists on the classification of velocity and acceleration data by female team-sport athletes. Alternatively, data mining techniques may be used to report team-sport athlete external load, without the requirement of arbitrary or physiologically defined thresholds...|$|E

Purpose: To quantify the energetic cost of running and <b>acceleration</b> <b>efforts</b> during rugby league competition {{to aid in}} prescription and monitoring of training. Methods: Global positioning system (GPS) {{data were collected from}} 37 professional rugby league players across 2 seasons. Peak values for relative distance, average acceleration/deceleration, and metabolic power (Pmet) were calculated for 10 different moving-average durations (1 – 10 min) for each position. A mixed-effects model was used to assess the effect of position for each duration, and individual comparisons were made using a magnitude-based-inference network. Results: There were almost certainly large differences in relative distance and Pmet between the 10 -min window and all moving averages 3 ̆c 5 min in duration (ES = 1. 21 – 1. 88). Fullbacks, halves, and hookers covered greater relative distances than outside backs, edge forwards, and middle forwards for moving averages lasting 2 – 10 min. Acceleration/deceleration demands were greatest in hookers and halves compared with fullbacks, middle forwards, and outside backs. Pmet was greatest in hookers, halves, and fullbacks compared with middle forwards and outside backs. Conclusions: Competition running intensities varied by both position and moving-average duration. Hookers exhibited the greatest Pmet of all positions, due to high involvement in both attack and defense. Fullbacks also reached high Pmet, possibly due to a greater absolute volume of running.

40|$|A {{number of}} inter-related issues {{since the turn}} of the 21 st century have {{resonated}} through domestic and foreign policies across the world: ongoing violences and the war on/of terror, various urban ‘racial disturbances’, economic austerity and an increasing hostility to immigrants across Europe. In the UK, this has resulted in both more repressive policies on immigration, and the <b>acceleration</b> of <b>efforts</b> to bring different communities together (Askins and Pain 2011). Among the latter, ‘community cohesion’ has become a central theme for social policy, outlined as the attempt to build communities with a ‘common vision and a sense of belonging’, in which diversity is valued, there are similar life opportunities for all, and positive relationships between people from different backgrounds within neighbourhoods (DCLG 2007). Given that this era is dominated by increasingly diverse migration (ONS 2013), heterogeneity and intercultural encounter is arguably more routine, raising speculation as to whether better appreciation and understanding of difference can move us towards a more ‘cosmospolitan’ society (eg. Simonsen 2008; Valentine 2008). However, such ‘superdiversity’ also has the potential to increase conflict between selves/others, namely, in the UK, between majority white and minority and migrant communities of colour.

Adopting water-efficient technologies and practices that reduce consumption holds great potential for commercial, industrial, and institutional (CII) water users. Such measures can help stretch limited water supplies, save businesses money, reduce energy consumption, improve water quality, and protect local, regional, and statewide ecosystems. In February of 2008, California’s governor called for a reduction in per capita urban water use of 20 percent by 2020, and the CII sector has a critical {{role to play in}} reaching this target. In California, CII sector water use is estimated to be 2. 5 million acre-feet per year—or approximately one-third of total water use in California’s urban areas.

This capability arises from the inclusion of a small unobstructed Be scattering element that is strategically located within the cryostat that houses the array of nine germanium detectors. The Ge detectors are segmented, with both a front and rear active volume. Low energy photons (below about 100 keV) can reach a rear segment of a Ge detector only indirectly, by scattering. Low energy photons from the Sun have a direct path to the Be and have a high probability of Compton scattering into a rear segment of a Ge detector. The azimuthal distribution of these scattered photons carries with it a signature of the linear polarization of the incident flux. Sensitivity estimates, based on Monte Carlo simulations and in-flight background measurements, indicate that a 20 - 100 keV polarization sensitivity of less than a few percent can be achieved for X-class flares.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} scientific core drilling undertaken primarily {{to gain a better}} understanding of the bedrock geology in north-central Minnesota. The drilling and concomitant mapping were supported by the Minerals Diversification Program of the state legislature. The study area lies in southern Koochiching, northern Itasca and east-central Beltrami Counties. This region was selected because data are suggestive of mineral resource potential, but existing geologic maps were too generalized to guide private minerals exploration efforts. The thick cover of glacial deposits in this region requires bedrock geologic mapping to be based largely on the interpretation of geophysical maps. Core drilling and outcrop mapping identify the rock types responsible for the geophysical patterns. It is hoped that geologic mapping by this method will encourage private minerals exploration. In addition, this mapping is an <b>acceleration</b> of on-going <b>efforts</b> by the Minnesota Geological Survey to produce accurate geologic maps of the state to meet existing and future societal, academic and economic needs. The resulting bedrock geologic map at 1 : 250, 000 scale has been released as Minnesota Geological Survey Open-File Report 89 - 1 which is being reviewed before formal publication. In the course of the drilling program much information was acquired regarding the thickness and lithology of Quaternary surficial deposits and the locally thick weathered bedrock materials (regolith). No formal plans exist at this time to publish an interpretation of these data, but the data are presented here on the geologic logs...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a paucity}} of {{information}} comparing competitive rugby league match play dynamics between northern and southern hemispheres. Notably, differences in the match demands of games played in an intensive period have not previously been reported. This study {{is the first to}} assess such demands, quantified using GPS/accelerometer technology, during a competitive three game period that comprised two games in England, interspersed with one game in Australia. The three games were completed over a period of 23 days. In-game data from fifteen elite level rugby league players were collected. The focus was to assess differences in activity profiles undertaken in each game. There were significant increases in the total number of high speed sprints, distance covered at high speed and acceleration/deceleration efforts undertaken in Australia when compared to England. No significant differences in other key performance indicators were observed. The current findings demonstrate minimal differences in the activity profiles of game play in elite professional rugby league, with the exception of high-speed activity and acceleration/deceleration efforts. The European team were defeated in their game in Australia, with clearly higher levels of total high speed sprints, <b>acceleration</b> and deceleration <b>efforts</b> being observed in that game when compared with games undertaken in England. Such findings emphasise the continuing use of GPS/accelerometer technologies in determining in-game performance characteristics associated with likely success, though the milieu of factors contributing to success must be considered in entirety...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{potential}} link between running loads and soft-tissue injury is appealing, the evidence supporting or refuting this relationship in high-performance team sport athletes is nonexistent, with all published studies using subjective measures (e. g., ratings of perceived exertion) to quantify training loads. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the risk of low-intensity (e. g., walking, jogging, total distances) and highintensity (e. g., high <b>acceleration</b> and velocity <b>efforts,</b> repeated high-intensity exercise bouts) movement activities on lower body soft-tissue injury in elite team sport athletes. Thirty-four elite rugby league players participated in this study. Global positioning system data and the incidence of lower body soft-tissue injuries were monitored in 117 skill training sessions during the preseason and in-season periods. The frailty model (an extension of the Cox proportional regression model for recurrent events) was applied to calculate the relative risk of injury after controlling for all other training data. The risk of injury was 2. 7 (95 % confidence interval 1. 2 - 6. 5) times higher when very high-velocity running (i. e., sprinting) exceeded 9 m per session. Greater distances covered in mild, moderate, and maximum accelerations and low- and very low- intensitymovement velocities were associated with a reduced risk of injury. These results demonstrate that greater amounts of very high-velocity running (i. e., sprinting) are associated with an increased risk of lower body soft-tissue injury, whereas distances covered at low and moderate speeds offer a protective effect against soft-tissue injury. From an injury prevention perspective, these findings provide empirical support for restricting the amount of sprinting performed in preparation for elite team sport competition. However, coaches should also consider the consequences of reducing training loads on the development of physical qualities and playing performance...|$|R
