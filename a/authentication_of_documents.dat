The most popular methods used for <b>authentication</b> <b>of</b> digital <b>documents</b> are public key encryption-based authentication and digital watermarking.

40|$|Abstract. In image {{authentication}} watermarking, hidden data {{is inserted}} into an image to detect any accidental or malicious image alteration. In the literature, quite {{a small number}} of cryptography-based secure authentication methods are available for binary images. This paper proposes a new authentication watermarking method for binary images. It can detect any visually significant alteration while maintaining good visual quality for virtually all types of binary images (possibly excluding dispersed-dot halftones). As usual, the security of the algorithm lies only on the secrecy of a secret- or private-key. This paper also presents a variation of the proposed scheme that can locate the modified region with good spatial resolution. A possible application of the proposed technique is in Internet fax transmission, i. e. for legal <b>authentication</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> routed outside the phone network. ...|$|E

Many manufacturers of color laser printers and copiers designed their devices in a way to integrate a unique tracking pattern in each print-out.

In this paper we present an important extension of our previous work for (a) {{detecting the}} class of printer that was used to generate a print-out, namely automatic methods for (b) comparing two base patterns from two different print-outs to verify if two print-outs come from the same printer and for (c) automatic decoding of the base pattern to extract the serial number and, if available, the time and the date the document was printed. Finally, we present (d) the first public dataset on tracking patterns (also called machine identification codes) containing 1264 images from 132 different printers. Evaluation on this dataset resulted in accuracies of up to 93. 0 % for detecting the printer class.
