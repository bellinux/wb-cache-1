However, the information provided by crash data may not be adequate to explain the causal factors that lead to a crash. Therefore, {{a different kind of}} road safety indicator that can extensively describe the actual <b>road</b> <b>environment</b> problems of a road section is considered essential. This paper considered fourteen <b>road</b> <b>environment</b> indicators based on their abilities to portray current <b>road</b> <b>environment</b> conditions and their potential towards road crash incidence. These indicators were collected using naturalistic driving technique within the 80 -km road length connecting Kuantan and Maran town in the state of Pahang, Malaysia in which the composite <b>road</b> <b>environment</b> risk index was finally developed. This composite <b>road</b> <b>environment</b> risk index is found to be a useful proactive method to identify the potential problematic road sections that require urgent road improvement works as compared to the reactive crash data analysis method...|$|R

Bener, A., et al. (2003) who had done extensive works in proposing a strategy to improve road safety in developing countries concluded that Malaysia {{is also one of the}} most prominent countries in this issue. He summarized that by looking at the motorization levels and fatality rates for various countries within 1988 – 1998, Malaysia has reported to have about 1111. 0 vehicles / 10, 000 persons with 2. 43 fatalities were recorded for every 10, 000 persons. As such, this study aims to investigate crucial <b>road</b> <b>environment</b> factors for Asian developing countries by taking Malaysia Federal Road network as study area. Fourteen <b>road</b> <b>environment</b> attributes were selected based on specific criteria with an aim to improve the overall environment condition of the road. Crash data were supplied by Malaysian Royal Police Force (PDRM) and the rest of the data were mainly collected using video-logs and on-site measurement methods. Three stretches of roads comprises of 315. 5 km of federal roads were selected as study areas. A test vehicle attached with video-camera was driven along this road where the <b>road</b> <b>environments</b> were recorded. By employing principal component analysis, crucial <b>road</b> <b>environment</b> factors as well as specific attributes that constantly contributed to safety problem of this road were identified. Four <b>road</b> <b>environment</b> factors namely roadway, roadside, road infrastructure and <b>road</b> operational <b>environment</b> have collectively been identified as the most crucial <b>road</b> <b>environment</b> factors for federal roads.

There is little empirical evidence {{of the impact of}} the <b>road</b> <b>environment</b> on physical activity among children/adolescents in their neighborhoods. Most recent studies have examined perceptions rather than objective measures of the <b>road</b> <b>environment.</b> This was a cross-sectional study of children aged 8 – 9  years (n[*]=[*] 188) and adolescents aged 13 – 15  years (n[*]=[*] 346) who were participants in the 3 -year follow-up of the Children Living in Active Neighborhoods (CLAN) longitudinal study in Melbourne, Australia. At baseline (2001), they were recruited from 19 state primary schools in areas of varying socioeconomic status across Melbourne. Habitual walking/cycling to local destinations was parent-reported for children and self-reported for adolescents, while moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) outside school hours was recorded using accelerometers. <b>Road</b> <b>environment</b> features in each participant’s neighborhood (area of radius 800  m around the home) were measured objectively using a geographical information system. Regression analyses found no associations between <b>road</b> <b>environment</b> variables and children’s likelihood of making at least seven walking/cycling trips per week to neighborhood destinations. Adolescent girls residing in neighborhoods with two to three traffic/pedestrian lights were more likely to make seven or more walking/cycling trips per week as those whose neighborhoods had fewer traffic lights (OR: 2. 7; 95 % CI: 1. 2 – 6. 2). For adolescent boys, residing on a cul-de-sac, compared with a through road, was associated with increases in MVPA of 9  min after school, 5  min in the evenings, and 22  min on weekend days.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this project}} were to find correlations between the 'tidal flow' of traffic {{and the frequency of}} road crashes, as well as between various broad scale <b>road</b> <b>environment</b> factors and the frequency of road crashes.

When examining the data for correlations, the traffic flow and crash rate along with various <b>road</b> <b>environment</b> characteristics were considered. It was found that a greater traffic flow did not mean a greater crash rate would result with the time periods with lower traffic flow having higher crash rates. However, correlations were established between various <b>road</b> <b>environment</b> factors and the frequency of <b>road</b> crashes. <b>Road</b> <b>environment</b> characteristics that were found to influence the amount of road crashes included the seal width, pavement width, formation width, the speed limit zones and the AADT of the road.

40|$|According to WHO (2013), middle-income {{countries}} like Malaysia, Indonesia {{and several other}} ASEAN countries suffer the highest traffic fatality rates compared to most developed countries where crash statistics are {{used to evaluate the}} safety status of these countries. Crash data has been acknowledged as the most popular and acceptable road safety indicator in recognizing road section's safety status. However, the reliability of crash data in correctly identifying the road section's safety status has been widely argued by road safety experts. In light of that, a new method called composite risk index that would act as a proactive measure in evaluating road section's safety status has been introduced and tested in this research. This research attempts to fill in the missing links on the role of different <b>road</b> <b>environment</b> factors in producing risk towards road users.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to analyze the drivers’ behavior while approaching pedestrian crossings under different driver – pedestrian interaction conditions and to assess the effectiveness of Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADASs) for pedestrian detection among several <b>road</b> <b>environments.</b> Three different <b>road</b> <b>environments</b> were implemented in a fixed-base driving simulator: urban road, sub – urban road and rural road. Several driver – pedestrian interactions were implemented in addition to the pedestrian absence condition. The simulated ADAS provided a visual – auditive message. Forty – five participants drove the three <b>road</b> <b>environments</b> scenarios in which three pedestrian crossroads were implemented (pedestrian absence, pedestrian presence with ADAS and pedestrian presence without ADAS).

The effect of ADAS among the <b>road</b> <b>environments</b> was similar for the urban and sub – urban road, resulting in a less abrupt braking maneuver that began in advance compared to that adopted in ADAS absence condition.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Amphibians are {{experiencing}} global population declines and {{are one of}} the most threatened groups of vertebrates. This can be attributed to multiple environmental stressors such as habitat loss, disease, invasive species, and climate change. For vocal amphibian species, loss of acoustic habitat due to anthropogenic noise may be yet another environmental stressor. The Pacific chorus frog (Pseudacris regilla) is the most common vocal species of the Pacific Northwest. It is described as a generalist that can occupy human-dominated habitat types, including agricultural and urban wetlands. As such, this species is exposed to anthropogenic noise which can interfere with vocalizations during the breeding season. We hypothesized that Pacific chorus frogs would alter the spatial and temporal structure of their breeding vocalizations to accommodate a widespread anthropogenic stressor: road noise. We compared Pacific chorus frog call structure and <b>ambient</b> <b>road</b> noise levels at 8 sites along a gradient of noise exposures in the Willamette Valley, Oregon, USA. We used both passive acoustic monitoring and directional recordings to determine source level (i. e. amplitude or volume), dominant frequency (i. e. pitch), call duration, and call rate of individual frogs and to quantify <b>ambient</b> <b>road</b> noise levels. We found that Pacific chorus frogs significantly reduced their call rate at relatively higher levels of <b>ambient</b> <b>road</b> noise, leading to a reduction in the amount of total time spent calling. We found no other changes to call structure (e. g. frequency and duration). The absence of additional call structure changes to mediate the impact of road noise resulted in a drastic reduction in the active call space of an individual frog. Coupled with the decrease in call rate, this signifies that communication is significantly reduced both spatially and temporally. This may have implications for the reproductive success of this species, which appears to rely on specific call repertoires to portray relative fitness and attract mates. Reduction of acoustic habitat by anthropogenic noise may emerge as a compounding environmental stressor for an already sensitive taxonomic group...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to explore the relationship between crime and road safety {{as well as the}} impact of criminal activities on the <b>road</b> <b>environment</b> in South Africa. These relationships have not been fully explored in the South African context, with its high road accident and fatality rates, and high levels of exposure to crime. The paper shows that criminal activities in the <b>road</b> <b>environment</b> extend significantly beyond the mere committing of road traffic offences and may {{have a negative impact on}} the safe operation of the road network and broader <b>road</b> <b>environment,</b> in addition to endangering the lives of road users and innocent bystanders. The impact of crime on road safety can be considered from various angles, the paper therefore uses a multidisciplinary approach to analyse the extent of the problem more comprehensively. A multi-disciplinary approach to analyse the safety and security of the <b>road</b> <b>environment</b> includes the potential role of sciences such as town-planning, transportation planning, information technology, ITS and traffic engineering, criminology, social psychology and road traffic management. Firstly, the paper provides an overview of research findings and practices regarding the relationship between crime and road safety, through the inputs from different disciplines. Secondly, the paper describes the criminal activities in South Africa that may have a negative impact on road safety. This includes a wide range of activities within the <b>road</b> <b>environment,</b> vehicle related crimes and road user behaviour. Other crime related incidences include the mugging of pedestrians and cyclists, taxi violence and conflict between taxi associations endangering both drivers and commuters, etc. Thirdly, the paper highlights some of the crime prevention and road safety interventions prevalent locally and internationally. Shortcomings and challenges associated with gaining more effective control over criminal activities in the <b>road</b> <b>environment</b> in South Africa are also mentioned. The paper concludes that a more focused operational approach and research are required to determine the impact of crime on road safety in South Africa.

The results for the incidence of slight injury crashes reveal that the <b>road</b> <b>environment,</b> degree of curvature, and presence of tram stops are significant factors, and that traffic volume has a diminishing effect on the crash risk.
