40|$|Background: People’s Republic of China has {{attracted}} much FDI throughout the decades. According to the World Bank (2016), China has received approximately 20 per {{cent of the}} total FDI to developing countries {{the last ten years}} which has contributed to the country’s huge economic growth. With a record capital surplus, in combination with governmental policies such as “Going-Global”, China has transformed from being a recipient of FDI, to an investor itself. Much of the OFDI in Europe has gone to Germany and France {{but there is also a}} rising interest in the Swedish market. China’s investments in Sweden tripled between 2014 and 2015 and Chinese OFDI to Sweden <b>amounted</b> <b>SEK</b> 7. 2 billion during 2016. Problem discussion & Purpose: Cross-cultural business is not risk free and cultural differences between China and Sweden are extremely high. Measured in cultural dimensions, the Chinese culture differs from the Swedish culture in five out of six dimensions, which may impose problems when establishing on the Swedish market. The purpose of this thesis is therefore to investigate how Chinese companies internationalize towards Sweden and which aspects of cultural risk they encounter when establishing on the Swedish market. Furthermore, the paper aims to investigate how different trade/investment-facilitating organizations can help Chinese companies reduce cultural risk when establishing in Sweden. Theoretical framework: Focus has been on internationalization theories such as the Uppsala model, the network approach and the born-globals. Focus has also been on theories in risk and risk management as well as on the importance of cultural differences which is done by comparing Chinese cultural values in contrast to Swedish cultural values. Methodology: The empirical data is generated through a triangulation of methods. Primarily, data is collected from semi-structured interviews which were conducted with representatives from Business Sweden, PwC, Vinge, Mannheimer Swartling and Sino Agro Food. Data is also complemented with internet-mediated questionnaires to Chinese companies situated in Sweden. Conclusions: Three aspects of the Swedish economy attract Chinese investors; innovation & technology, competence (know-how and managerial skills) and the Swedish market (strong brands and business opportunities). The internationalization mode used towards Sweden does not fit any of the previously well-known models. However, a new model is introduced- “bred global”, which might fit Chinese internationalization better. Regarding cultural difficulties, differences in norms & values and laws & regulations are found, as well as difference in mentality/work ethics and the concept of time. Prevention of these are establishing relationships, sending agents beforehand and keeping Swedish management in M&As. Trade and investment facilitating organizations in Sweden can assist Chinese companies with different aspects of psychic distance. Business Sweden may reduce market risk and political risk, assisting with market analyses and establishment processes as well as getting contact with lawyers and recruitment agencies. Vinge can reduce legal risk with expertise in business law, M&A related services and negotiations- working as a bridge in cross border transactions. PwC may reduce market risks, assisting with business set up, auditing services, tax planning and transfer pricing compliance...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} part of a project that aims at {{exploring}} whether the current allocation of resources for fighting the two illnesses campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis can be regarded as economically efficient in Sweden. When resources are allocated towards reducing a specific illness both costs (more administration, control etc. needed) and benefits (a reduction of the number of cases) emerge. Analysing the efficiency of an allocation comes down to calculating and comparing all costs and benefits to which the specific allocation can be associated. In this report the cost-of-illness method is applied to calculate direct costs (for example medication, transport and health care) and indirect costs (productivity losses due to illness or premature death) for the current number of cases of the two illnesses in Sweden. These are the case-related costs which are reduced when more resources are spent to fight an illness. They are therefore part of the benefits analysis of the project. The report shows that campylobacteriosis is currently more than four times more common than salmonellosis in Sweden with approximately 80 000 cases each year. The direct and indirect costs for these cases are SEK 330 million. The number of salmonellosis cases is about 17 000 each year, with direct and indirect costs <b>amounting</b> to <b>SEK</b> 80 million. About 60 percent of the total costs (for both illnesses) are associated with productivity losses arising as employees are at home because of their own illness...|$|R
40|$|COPD {{and asthma}} are common {{diseases}} worldwide and entail high {{costs for the}} society. The diseases also cause impairment in {{quality of life for}} the patients. Most of the health economic studies of COPD and asthma have been based on registry data. There is a lack of studies using health economic data of representative samples derived from studies of the general population when estimating the burden of illness of COPD and asthma. The aim with this thesis was to estimate the direct, indirect and intangible costs of COPD and asthma using well-defined and representative cohorts of subjects with COPD and asthma in northern Sweden. Telephone interviews were conducted in order to record the resource use due to asthma and COPD and the resource use due to exacerbations of COPD. Three health-related quality of life questionnaires were used for measuring {{the quality of life for}} the patients with COPD. The total costs for asthma were estimated at SEK 15, 919 annually per subject with asthma, and the direct costs accounted to 3 1 % and the indirect costs to 69 % of the total costs. The costs for subjects with persistent asthma were more than 10 times higher compared to the costs for subjects with mild intermittent asthma, SEK 27, 628 and SEK 2, 222, respectively. The total societal costs were estimated at about SEK 3, 7 billion (95 % CI 1. 5 - 5. 7) for asthma in Sweden in the ages from 25 to 56 years. The annual costs for COPD <b>amounted</b> to <b>SEK</b> 13, 418 per subject with COPD. The direct costs accounted to 42 % and the indirect costs to 58 % of the total costs. Subjects with a severe disease had approximately 3 times higher costs compared to subjects with moderate COPD, and more than 10 times higher compared to subjects with mild COPD. The total societal costs for Sweden were estimated at about SEK 9. 1 billion (95 % Cl 6. 1 - 12. 8). As COPD to a great extent is an underdiagnosed. disease, the total costs were divided into subjects with and without a physiciandiagnosis of COPD. The costs for undiagnosed subjects accounted to approximately 40 % of the total costs. Costs for exacerbations of COPD were related to severity of the exacerbations and severity of COPD. Severe exacerbations were on average 10 times more expensive than moderate and 60 times more expensive than rnild/moderate exacerbations. The total costs of exacerbations during a 41 / 2 months study period <b>amounted</b> to <b>SEK</b> 13, 708 for subjects with a severe COPD compared to SEK 294 for subjects with a very mild COPD. The costs of exacerbations comprised to 35 - 45 % of the direct costs of COPD. Severity of COPD was correlated to health related quality of life but less so to generic quality of life measures. In conclusion, the thesis shows that asthma and COPD are costly diseases for the society. The costs were found to be strongly dependent of the severity of asthma and COPD. The costs of COPD were strongly affected by impaired lung function and exacerbations...|$|R
40|$|Problem background/Introduction: Many of today’s {{organizations}} {{struggle with}} securing a high performing manpower due {{to either a}} retiring or an increasingly mobile workforce. If a company fails in attracting and retaining their talents, costs related to employee movements - in this study employee turnover costs - will probably increase. Retention of people and promoting the employees’ knowledge, capabilities and talents are becoming ever more important in order for companies to stay competitive. As {{a solution to the}} employee turnover problem, Succession planning and Management (SP&M) could be applied. Purpose: To investigate the costs associated with employee turnover, manager turnover to be specific, and to identify SP&M success factors to reduce these costs. Research questions: What are the costs related to manager turnover in a Swedish retail warehouse? What are SP&M success factors for reducing manager turnover costs? To answer the second research question we also ask; Why should SP&M be used to reduce manager turnover cost? Limitations: This case study was performed at one company and in one particular warehouse. The focus was put on three different managerial levels within the warehouse, all other personnel were excluded. The internal corporate data was compiled into lump sums, representing one total cost for manager turnover. Methodology: This study combined a descriptive research with a qualitative research approach. A case study was performed where semi-structured interviews were used as primary data and internal corporate data and previous literature were applied as secondary data. The analysis of the qualitative findings was performed using an iterative and thematic analysis approach. Empirical results: Tangible and intangible employee turnover costs related to manager turnover have been identified. The tangible costs, such as vacancy costs, training and education costs, <b>amount</b> to <b>SEK</b> - 15 788. The intangible costs, such as lost knowledge and lost productivity, measure SEK 3 266 667. SP&M is useful to handle resignations, competition for skilled employees, poor career development and manager transitions. The success factors to reduce employee turnover costs are: focus on development, identify talents and key positions, transparency and communication, continuous assessment and flexibility. Conclusions: To answer the first research question, both tangible and intangible employee turnover costs were identified. The tangible costs related to employee turnover are separation costs, vacancy costs, replacement costs and training costs. The intangible employee turnover costs are rework, lost knowledge, stress and lost moral and performance differential/lost productivity/lost sales. The intangible employee turnover costs constitute the major part of the total employee turnover cost, where the total costs <b>amount</b> to <b>SEK</b> 3 250 879 in the case of IKEA. To answer the second research question and the sub question, SP&M is considered useful to reduce costs related to resignations, competition for skilled employees, a lack of career development and poor transitions. Success factors for reducing these costs are a clear focus on development of the process and a long-term and proactive approach to find and retain people. It is crucial to identify key talents and positions to achieve seamless transitions and avoid high costs related to manager turnover. In this process transparency and communication are important, {{especially when it comes to}} building strong relationships between the manager and employees in order to guarantee a sound leadership pipeline. By continuously assessing the SP&M processes, a company could easier detect future vacancies and be proactive in reducing turnover costs. Flexibility becomes a success factors as there exists competition for talented employees, even within the company. MSc in Innovation and Industrial Managemen...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{relative}} cost-effectiveness of a high-intensity treatment (HIT) and a low-intensity treatment (LIT) for smoking cessation. Methods: The societal {{and health care}} perspective economic evaluation {{was based on the}} reported number of quitters at 12 -month follow-up (point prevalence) from a randomized controlled trial of 2 smoking cessation programs in Sweden. Future disease-related costs (in Swedish kronor [SEK] 2004; SEK 7. 35 = USD 1) and health effects (in quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) were estimated via a Markov model comprising lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cardiovascular disease including stroke with costs and QALYs discounted 3 % annually. Results: HIT was more effective than LIT (23 % vs. 16 % quitters), but at a considerably higher intervention cost: SEK 26, 100 versus 9, 100 per quitter. The model-estimated societal costs avoided did not balance the higher intervention costs, so the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) <b>amounted</b> to <b>SEK</b> 100, 000 per QALY for HIT versus LIT. All sensitivity analyses indicated an ICER below SEK 300, 000 and that HIT is the preferred option if the decision maker willingness-to-pay exceeds SEK 50, 000 per QALY. Compared with no intervention, LIT was cost saving, whereas HIT was estimated at SEK 8, 400 per QALY. Conclusions: Compared with no smoking cessation program, it is a societal waste not to implement the LIT as it is estimated to result in lower societal costs. The incremental cost per QALY gained of SEK 100, 000 for HIT is considered very cost-effective in Sweden. Thus, if smoking cessation programs are judged {{in the same manner as}} other Swedish health care measures, the high-intensity program should be chosen before the low-cost program...|$|R
40|$|Health-health {{analysis}} (HHA) {{focuses on}} statistical lives {{themselves as a}} numeraire. The underlying principle is that the expected gains in {{health and safety of}} reduced risks in one area may result in increasing risks somewhere else in society. By reducing one risk other risks may increase due to changed individual behaviour. In addition to this direct effect, another indirect effect will also be present. Expenditure on a particular health policy or safety regulation must be financed in one way or another. which will result in an opportunity cost or income effect leaving less resources for other health and safety promoting activities in society. Thus, we will have an effect that reduces safety and health benefits induced by that income loss. Whether the total net health effect from a specific safety regulation or health policy is positive or negative must be empirically analysed. One way of estimating the income loss that induces one death, which we call the value of an induced death (VOID), is to estimate it as a multiple of the traditional value to avert a statistical death, also named the value of a statistical life (VOSL). A contingent valuation (CV) study eliciting the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for reducing the overall risk of dying was performed as a postal questionnaire in Sweden in 1998. By use of data from this study, it was possible to estimate the VOID and the VOSL in Sweden <b>amounting</b> to <b>SEK</b> 116 and SEK 20. 8 million respectively, indicating that the net health result confined to mortality effects, will be negative (more lives will be lost than saved) if a health policy or safety regulation will cost more than SEK 116 million per life saved...|$|R
40|$|The {{companies}} that own {{nuclear power plants}} in Sweden are responsible for adopting such measures as are {{needed in order to}} manage and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste from Swedish nuclear power plants and to dismantle the plants. According to the law, the Financing Act, the reactor owners shall pay a fee on nuclear energy production in order to fulfil this responsibility. The fee is based on a probable cost for waste management for 25 years of operation of all NPPs. Besides paying a fee the reactor owners must also give guarantees as security for remaining costs. Cost increases such as consequences of major changes, disruptions etc. are covered via these guarantees. The calculations are based on the plan for management and disposal of the radioactive waste products that has been prepared by SKB. In order to include the influence of uncertainties and variations a new calculation method has been applied. The uncertainties have been dealt with by means of a statistical weighing-together of their influence on the costs. This method differs from the method used in earlier years when the uncertainties were dealt with as a percentage surcharge on the calculated costs. The result of the calculation is presented as a distribution function indicating the probability associated with a given total cost, i. e. the probability that the calculated cost will prove true.

40|$|SummaryObjectivesAsthma is {{a common}} disease in most countries. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the societal costs for subjects with asthma. MethodsTelephone interviews regarding resource utilization were made in a representative sample of 115 randomly selected subjects with asthma derived from a large population study of obstructive airway diseases. Direct and indirect costs were measured, and the costs were also transformed with the estimated prevalence of asthma in Sweden. ResultsAverage annual costs were SEK 15919 (USD 1592; EUR 1768) per subject with asthma in the ages between 25 and 56 years. The direct and indirect costs were SEK 4931 (31. 0 %) and SEK 10988 (69. 0 %), respectively, and were highly dependent of age and disease severity. Assuming that the prevalence is representative for Sweden as a whole, the asthmatics would amount to 226000 in the ages between 25 and 56 years, corresponding to an overall prevalence in Sweden of 6 – 7 %. The total costs of asthma for the society <b>amounted</b> thus to <b>SEK</b> 3. 7 billion in these ages. ConclusionsThe total costs of asthma for the society could be estimated at 3. 7 billion SEK in the age range of 25 – 56 years, and thus approximately twice as high in the whole population of Sweden.

40|$|SummaryObjectivesThe {{objectives}} of the presented study were to estimate societal costs of COPD in Sweden, the relationship between costs and disease severity, and possible changes in the costs during the last decade. MethodsSubjects with COPD derived {{from the general population}} in Northern Sweden were interviewed by telephone regarding their resource utilisation and productivity losses four times quarterly during 2009 – 10. Mean annual costs were estimated for each severity stage of COPD. ResultsA strong relationship was found between disease severity and costs. Estimated mean annual costs per subject of mild, moderate, severe and very severe COPD <b>amounted</b> to 596 (<b>SEK</b> 5686), 3245 (SEK 30, 957), 5686 (SEK 54, 242), and 17, 355 euros (SEK 165, 569), respectively. The main cost drivers for direct costs were hospitalisations (for very severe COPD) and drugs (all other severity stages). The main cost driver for indirect costs was productivity loss due to sick-leave (for mild COPD) and early retirement (all other severity stages). Costs appeared to be lower in 2010 than in 1999 for subjects with severe and very severe COPD, but higher for those with mild and moderate COPD. ConclusionOur results show that costs of COPD are strongly related to disease severity, and scaling the data to the whole Swedish population indicates that the total costs in Sweden amounted to 1. 5 billion euros (SEK 13. 9  bn) in 2010. In addition, costs have decreased since 1999 for subjects with severe and very severe COPD, but increased for those with mild and moderate COPD...|$|R

Many treatment alternatives for depression are currently available, but there is insufficient knowledge of their consequences on costs and their value of actual and potential health gains. The aims of the present thesis were to study aspects of the health economics of depression that are important for priority settings: the burden of depression to society, cost and health-related quality of life associated with patients treated for depression and modelling the cost-effectiveness of treatments for depression. A new approach was developed to assess the societal cost of depression in Europe. The results showed that more than 21 million Europeans are suffering from depression and that depression cost European society more than SEK 1000 billion per year, two-thirds of which are found outside the healthcare system. The cost of depression equals SEK 2 300 per inhabitant in Europe corresponding to 1 % of the European national incomes. Naturalistic studies of cost and outcome in clinical practice are rare. The study "Health Economics of Depression In Sweden" (HEADIS) {{is one of the}} first naturalistic observational studies conducted in Sweden, collecting information on the cost and quality of life related to patients treated for depression in primary care. The cost for a patient treated for a depressive episode was estimated at SEK 51000. Depressed patients were, on average, absent from work 1. 5 months during six months, which constituted 65 % of the total costs for depression. Depression causes a reduction in quality of life of 50 % as compared to the general population, which is in the same range as after a severe stroke. Treatment significantly improved patients' quality of life measured with a standard generic quality of life instrument (EQ- 5 D). For patients who went into remission, we observed both statistically significant reductions in costs and improvements in quality of life of more than 40 % as compared to non-remitting patients. A computer simulation model was developed to project costs and benefits from alternative treatments for depression. The health economic data collected in the HEADIS study was used in the model. A simulation was performed with a hypothetical intervention over a five-year period. The results showed that a new treatment which increases the probability that the patient goes into remission, produced cost savings <b>amounting</b> to <b>SEK</b> 20 100 and a QALY gain of 0. 07. The results underscore that the achievement of clinical remission is a key health economic parameter to reduce the burden of depression. This thesis has contributed with new health economic data on the social cost of depression at an international level, and patient-level data of costs and quality of life for depressed patients in a primary care setting. Accurately estimating the impact of a disease, in terms of costs and quality of life, is the first important step towards better priorities of resource allocation to reduce the burden of the disease. This data is also an input in economic evaluations, which provides information for allocation of resources between different types of treatments. Increased research efforts are needed to provide the necessary effectiveness data in clinical practice, and to make such studies relevant and credible as instruments for resource allocation in practice...|$|R
40|$|A {{construction}} company {{consists of a}} number of different sites where the physical production is taking place. This production is not always performed in the best possible way. There are numerous things such as organisation, logistics, co-ordination, technique, quality and others that can be improved. To have a process of continuous improvement at sites it is necessary to be able to evaluate their performance. Doing this only in terms of profits, which is the most common way, is not sufficient. Other ways of evaluating site performance such as productivity measurements are therefore needed. The {{purpose of this study was}} to find measures of productivity which could be used to evaluate site performance. Such measures should be cheap, understandable, univocal and be possible to relate to company objectives. With the results from productivity measurements a process of internal benchmarking could be initiated at construction companies. This could make it possible to find sites with excellent performance, investigate the factors of importance for such performance and try to use these results in a process of continuous improvement. Finding such determinants of site productivity is of vital importance for the improvement of the performance of a company. The overriding method in this work has been to "steal" ideas from others. By investigating how others had been measuring productivity and by evaluating these measures, the expectation was that measures would be found that could be applied on construction sites. However, a number of other and more "well define& methods such as Data Envelopment Analysis, inquiries, multiple regression analysis, case studies and practical tests have been used. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) had not previously been used to measure construction site productivity in Sweden. DEA was used to analyse 104 projects constructed during the period 1989 to 1992. The output factor used was value added, and the inputs were the costs of staff, workers and machines. The projects analysed included 3 3 office buildings, 40 blocks of flats and 3 1 roads and bridges, and the total invoicing <b>amounted</b> to <b>SEK</b> 2 232 million. Substantial differences in input saving efficiency could be noted regarding the projects included in the analyses. A second step in this benchmarking process was that of trying to relate the differences in efficiency to variables affecting the result. A questionnaire was therefore sent out to all the site managers. This information, together with the results from the DEA, was then analysed using multiple regression. The result was that variables such as additional work ordered by the client, formal education and employment time of the site manager and participation of workers in planning did not seem to have any significant effect for any of the types of products studied. For the blocks of flats the variables which showed a negative correlation with the result from the DEA were extended construction time, design and build contract, major parts prefabricated and serious disturbances. The only positive variable was in-house design. For the offices, variables such as a large share of the work being performed by subcontractors and a high proportion of the people employed being staff, were positive, while many different persons being involved in planning before the actual start of construction were negative. For the roads and bridges studied the positive variables were in-house design, a high proportion of staff, and many different persons being involved in planning before the start of construction work. The negative variable found was in this case high wages to the workers. Manufacturing industry exposed to foreign competition was assumed to have used measurements of productivity for a long time. Case studies were therefore performed at a number of production units throughout Sweden to find out how such measurements were made and how the results were used. As a reference case studies were also made at three sites within the construction industry. The findings were that there were large differences between the plants studied in the manufacturing industry and the construction industry. One of the major differences was the extent of the measurements. The units studied in manufacturing used many more different measures than did the construction sites studied. Another important and clear difference was the purpose of the measurements. The measurements performed in the manufacturing industries studied had several purposes. The main aim was to use the results for a comparison with those of competitors or with other units within the same company. The results from the measurements were also used to inform and motivate the employees, followup investments in new technology or changed organisations, control operations and as a basis for bonus wages. At the construction sites studied, on the other hand, the results were used mainly for cost forecasts and for estimates in connection with tendering. The most frequently used measure was labour productivity, and the reason for this was that labour productivity was considered to be both important and easy to understand. Other measures were, however, used to evaluate performance such as delivery time, stoppage times, actual hours or costs versus budgeted, energy used and many others. All these measures were considered by the company management in the manufacturing companies to be important for controlling their operations. At the construction companies the results were mainly used by the site managers to estimate the final costs. A general conclusion was that making performance measurements is never an easy task. There are always shortcomings with the measures chosen. In spite of this the advantages of measuring instead of not measuring are great when it comes to having a process of continuous improvement in a company. Various key ratios were measured at eight construction sites in northern Sweden and the results were evaluated. The different projects were followed for periods of between three months to one year with the help of personnel at the sites. The key ratios chosen were selected after performing the DEA and the case studies and after discussion with the persons at the sites. The key ratios were used to measure labour productivity, machine productivity, machine utilisation, material stock, material consumption, quality, actual hours versus budgeted hours, actual time compared to scheduled time and attendance. All these measurements showed that almost all the measures used could be obtained with limited effort with regard to both time and money. The results also contained valuable information which could be used to control site operations in a better way than that of today. Labour productivity was measured regularly using both value added and physical units as outputs. The use of value added was as a result difficult, mainly due to the great variations in site turnover. The results were easier to evaluate when physical units were used. These measurements, however, in some cases required more time. The measurements of material consumption, which were made using both physical quantifies and monetary value, were also in most cases easy to perform. Due to changes in both quality and size the results were sometimes difficult to interpret when physical quantities were used. Measuring actual costs, or hours, versus budgeted showed that this method of measuring is relatively easy but it also has many disadvantages. If such measurements are compared with the results from other sites it is necessary to use a reference against which these comparisons can be made. Informing and discussing the results with the workers revealed that there was a great interest from the workers in having feedback regarding their performance. A number of general conclusions regarding the execusion of measurements of site performance were drawn based on the results from the data envelopment analysis, the case studies and the tests with key ratios. One was that measurements of site performance could serve two purposes. The first was as a strategy tool for company management. By using the results from the site measurements in an internal benchmarking process it could be possible to identify sites with excellent performance within the company. By finding the characteristics of the good and the bad projects company management can improve competitiveness and long term profitability of the company. The second purpose was as a help for the site management in their daily work. The results could thus be used in a process of continuous improvement on site. In the selection of measures the purpose of the measurements should not soley be considered. The type of product also determines what measures should be used. For simple products with short manufacturing times and low complexity physical outputs should be used. For complex products with long manufacturing times the product has to be broken down into smaller, more measurable parts. Most of the data required to perform measurements are already available, or can be obtained with a moderate amount of effort. By using the workers for collecting and reporting some of the data, the work for the site management in this regard would be facilitated. This would, however, require that there would be a different flow of information than that of today. The workers should have more information regarding development at the site than they have today. There should also be a different flow of information from the site to the main office. The sites should report productivity data which could be used in an internal benchmarikng process where the prerequisites for good performance could be known to all sites and where excellent performance could be used as a reference.
