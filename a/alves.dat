5|$|<b>Alves</b> and Van-Dunem {{planned to}} arrest Neto on 21 May before {{he arrived at}} a meeting of the Central Committee and before the {{commission}} released its report on the activities of the Nitistas. However, the MPLA changed the location of the meeting shortly before its scheduled start, throwing the plotters' plans into disarray, but <b>Alves</b> attended the meeting and faced the commission anyway. The commission released its report, accusing him of factionalism. <b>Alves</b> fought back, denouncing Neto for not aligning Angola with the Soviet Union. After twelve hours of debate, the party voted 26 to 6 to dismiss <b>Alves</b> and Van-Dunem from their positions.|$|E
5|$|As the {{commander}} of the Permanent Municipal Guard Corps, Luís <b>Alves</b> brought order to the streets of Rio de Janeiro, through his own skill and through partnership with the city's chief of police, Eusébio de Queirós. Luís <b>Alves</b> was promoted from major to lieutenant colonel on 12 September 1837. Eusébio de Queirós {{was a member of the}} Partido Regressista (Reactionary Party), which had come to power that year. Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos, one of the leading Reactionaries and a government minister, attempted to attract Luís <b>Alves</b> to his party.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, Interior Minister Nito <b>Alves</b> {{had become a}} {{powerful}} member of the MPLA government. <b>Alves</b> had successfully put down Daniel Chipenda's Eastern Revolt and the Active Revolt during Angola's War of Independence. Factionalism within the MPLA became a major challenge to Neto's power by late 1975 and Neto gave <b>Alves</b> the task of once again clamping down on dissent. <b>Alves</b> shut down the Cabral and Henda Committees while expanding his influence within the MPLA through his control of the nation's newspapers and state-run television. <b>Alves</b> visited the Soviet Union in October 1976, and may have obtained Soviet support for a coup against Neto. By the time he returned, Neto had grown suspicious of Alves' growing power and sought to neutralize him and his followers, the Nitistas. Neto called a plenum meeting of the Central Committee of the MPLA. Neto formally designated the party as Marxist-Leninist, abolished the Interior Ministry (of which <b>Alves</b> was the head), and established a Commission of Enquiry. Neto used the commission to target the Nitistas, and ordered the commission to issue a report of its findings in March 1977. <b>Alves</b> and Chief of Staff José Van-Dunem, his political ally, began planning a coup d'état against Neto.|$|E
40|$|Studying {{literature}} {{is a means}} of learning the ways and value of life through people’s experiences. The experiences become more vivid when the literary work {{is in the form of}} drama/play. Henrik Ibsen’s drama entitled Ghosts is very fascinating since it deals with the struggle of a woman to fight against the 'ghost' of her past. This study intended to answer the following question: What are the roles of other characters that make Mrs. <b>Alving</b> feel haunted? The writer used objective criticism to analyze the roles of other characters that made Mrs. <b>Alving</b> feel haunted. In the analysis, the writer studied the roles of four characters, which were Captain <b>Alving,</b> Osvald <b>Alving,</b> Regina Engstrand, and Pastor Manders that made Mrs. <b>Alving</b> feel haunted. Captain Alving’s action that made Mrs. <b>Alving</b> feel haunted was that Captain Alving’s infidelity. Mrs. <b>Alving</b> was so suffered because of his debauchery life before and especially after marriage. Osvald Alving’s role that made Mrs. <b>Alving</b> feel haunted was that Osvald <b>Alving</b> repeated the history that Mrs. <b>Alving</b> was trying to hide. Osvald discovered that he had a inherited illness and he assumed it from his father. Meanwhile Regina Engstrand’s role that made Mrs. <b>Alving</b> feel haunted was the fact that Regina was the daughter of Captain <b>Alving</b> with Joanna. The last was coming from her close friend, Pastor Manders. Mrs. <b>Alving</b> was hoping the coming of Pastor Manders, a prominent religions leader, would have been a solution to Mrs. Alving’s complicated problems. On the other hand, it turned out to be the other way around. Pastor Mander’s suggestions which were based on religious norms turned to be haunting ghosts to Mrs. Alving’s consciousness. Those four characters, Captain <b>Alving,</b> Osvald <b>Alving,</b> Regina Engstrand, and Pastor Manders, had the biggest influence in Mrs. Alving’s life. Each of them had different roles that lead them to make Mrs. <b>Alving</b> feel haunted...|$|R

5|$|During the Bahia campaign, {{high-ranking}} officers mutinied against Labatut, who {{was taken}} prisoner and {{sent back to}} Rio de Janeiro. It is unlikely that Luís <b>Alves</b> was involved, but his uncle, Joaquim de Lima, was almost certainly part of the conspiracy and was chosen by the officers to replace Labatut. The campaign resumed, and the Portuguese withdrew from Salvador and set sail back to Portugal. On 2 July, the victorious Brazilians entered the city. The Emperor's Battalion returned to Rio de Janeiro, and Luís <b>Alves</b> was later promoted to captain on 22 January 1824.|$|E

He was given the rare honor of choosing his title; he decided to commemorate his recapture of Caxias, Maranhão's second richest town, which had fallen into rebel hands. Francisco de Lima wrote to his son with news of the Liberals' demand that PedroII's majority be immediately declared. Meanwhile, Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão (later Marquis of Paraná, a distant cousin of Caxias' wife and {{a leader of the}} Reactionary Party) sent letters to Luís <b>Alves</b> attempting to undermine the influence Francisco de Lima had on him and to dissuade him from supporting the unconstitutional proposal to declare the Emperor of age.|$|E

The Emperor's Battalion, to which Luís <b>Alves</b> was attached, was sent to guard Montevideo, then besieged by rebel forces. Luís <b>Alves</b> fought in engagements against the insurgents during 1827 (7 February, 5 July, 7 July, 14 July, 5 August and 7 August).|$|E

40|$|Chicken {{endogenous}} viruses, <b>ALVE</b> (Avian Leukosis Virus subgroup E), are inherited as LTR (long terminal repeat) retrotransposons, {{which are}} {{negatively correlated with}} disease resistance, and any changes in DNA methylation {{may contribute to the}} susceptibility to neoplastic disease. The relationship between <b>ALVE</b> methylation status and neoplastic disease in the chicken is undefined. White Leghorn inbred lines 7 (2) and 6 (3) at the ADOL have been respectively selected for resistance and susceptibility to tumors that are induced by avian viruses. In this study, the DNA methylation patterns of 3 approximately 6 CpG sites of four conserved regions in <b>ALVE,</b> including one unique region in <b>ALVE</b> 1, the promoter region in the TVB (tumor virus receptor of ALV subgroup B, D and E) locus, were analyzed in the two lines using pyrosequencing methods in four tissues, i. e., liver, spleen, blood and hypothalamus. A significant CpG hypermethylation level was seen in line 7 (2) in all four tissues, e. g., 91. 86 +/- 1. 63 % for <b>ALVE</b> region 2 in blood, whereas the same region was hemimethylated (46. 16 +/- 2. 56 %) in line 6 (3). CpG methylation contents of the <b>ALVE</b> regions were significantly lower in line 6 (3) than in line 7 (2) in all tissues (P < 0. 01) except the <b>ALVE</b> region 3 / 4 in liver. RNA expressions of <b>ALVE</b> regions 2 and 3 (PPT-U 3) were significantly higher in line 6 (3) than in line 7 (2) (P < 0. 01). The methylation levels of six recombinant congenic strains (RCSs) closely resembled to the background line 6 (3) in ALVE-region 2, which imply the methylation pattern of ALVE-region 2 may be a biomarker in resistant disease breeding. The methylation level of the promoter region in the TVB was significantly different in blood (P < 0. 05) and hypothalamus (P < 0. 0001), respectively. Our data disclosed a hypermethylation pattern of <b>ALVE</b> that may be relevant for resistance against ALV induced tumors in chickens...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Long-term {{selection}} (> 45 generations) for low or high juvenile {{body weight}} {{from a common}} founder population of White Plymouth Rock chickens has generated two extremely divergent lines, the LWS and HWS lines. In addition to a > 9 -fold difference between lines for the selected trait, large behavioural and metabolic {{differences between the two}} lines evolved {{during the course of the}} selection. We recently compared gene expression in brain tissue from birds representing these lines using a global cDNA array analysis and the results showed multiple but small expression differences in protein coding genes. The main differentially expressed transcripts were endogenous retroviral sequences identified as avian leucosis virus subgroup-E (<b>ALVE).</b> Results In this work we confirm the differential <b>ALVE</b> expression and analysed expression and number of proviral integrations in the two parental lines as well as in F 9 individuals from an advanced intercross of the lines. Correlation analysis between expression, proviral integrations and body weight showed that high <b>ALVE</b> levels in the LWS line were inherited and that more <b>ALVE</b> integrations were detected in LWS than HWS birds. Conclusion We conclude that only a few of the integrations contribute to the high expression levels seen in the LWS line and that high <b>ALVE</b> expression was significantly correlated with lower body weights for the females but not males. The conserved correlation between high expression and low body weight in females after 9 generations of intercrosses, indicated that <b>ALVE</b> loci conferring high expression directly affects growth or are very closely linked to loci regulating growth. </p...|$|R

5|$|At this point, Spielberg {{considered}} {{returning to}} direct the sequel. Over the Bicentennial weekend in 1976, Spielberg had hammered out a screenplay based on Quint's Indianapolis speech. Because of his contract for Close Encounters of the Third Kind, however, {{he would not be}} able to work on the film for a further year, a gap too long for the producers. Production designer Joe <b>Alves</b> (who would direct Jaws 3-D) and Verna Fields (who had been promoted to vice-president at Universal after her acclaimed editing on the first film) proposed that they co-direct it. The request was declined by the Directors Guild of America, partly because they would not allow a DGA member to be replaced by someone who was not one of its members, and partly because they, in the wake of events on the set of The Outlaw Josey Wales, had instituted a ban on any cast or crew members taking over as director during a film's production. The reins were eventually handed to Jeannot Szwarc, best known for the film Bug and whom <b>Alves</b> knew from working on the TV series Night Gallery. Szwarc recommenced production by filming the complicated waterskier scene, giving Gottlieb some time to complete the script. He reinstated the character of Deputy Hendricks, played by Jeffrey Kramer, who had been missing from the earlier script. Many of the teenagers were sacked, with the remaining roles developed.|$|E
