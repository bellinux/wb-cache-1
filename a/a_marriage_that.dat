25|$|On February 3, 2014, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the {{law firm}} of Mayer Brown filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin on behalf of four {{same-sex}} couples, including a lesbian couple married in Minnesota in 2013. It challenged the state constitution's ban on same-sex marriage as well as Wisconsin's marriage evasion law, which makes it a crime to leave the state to establish <b>a</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>that</b> is not valid in Wisconsin punishable with up to nine months in jail and a fine of as much as $10,000. The suit named Governor Scott Walker, several state officials, and two county clerks as defendants.|$|E
25|$|Kittie was his father's second wife. Years before Archie's birth, George Belaney had {{emigrated to}} the United States with his then-wife Elizabeth Cox and her younger sister Katherine (Kittie). After Elizabeth's early death, George persuaded Kittie, not yet 20, to marry him, <b>a</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>that</b> would have been illegal in Britain. Within the year they {{returned}} to Britain {{in time for the}} birth of their son Archie. The family lived together near Hastings until Kittie became pregnant for a second time. George and Kittie Belaney left to return to the United States, where he abandoned her. Archie remained in England in the care of his father's mother Juliana Belaney and his father's two younger sisters, Julia Caroline Belaney and Janet Adelaide Belaney, whom the boy would know as Aunt Carry and Aunt Ada. Kittie visited him a few times.|$|E

25|$|Queen Juliana {{attempted}} {{to stop the}} marriage, first by sending a member of her staff to Madrid to persuade the Princess not {{to go ahead with}} <b>a</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>that</b> would be a political disaster for the monarchy in the Netherlands. It seemed to work and the Queen went on Dutch radio to tell the citizens that Princess Irene had agreed to cancel her engagement and was returning to the Netherlands. When the airplane arrived at Schiphol Airport, the Princess was not on it, and Queen Juliana and her husband, Prince Bernhard were supplied with a Dutch military plane to go to Spain to retrieve their daughter. However, a message was delivered to the Queen from the Dutch government warning that it would resign en masse if she set foot in Spain. It was suggested that Princess Irene was a pawn of General Francisco Franco who tried to maximize the event to his benefit.|$|E
25|$|Finding {{a flaw in}} the {{marriage}} ceremony {{is considered to be}} a last resort in releasing an agunah. It is rarely used as it is typically difficult in finding actual cause in most marriages to retroactively invalidate it. In Jewish law, a marriage must be performed in front of two witnesses. In order to release the agunah, efforts are made to identify reasons why one of the witnesses was ineligible. This is typically unachievable as strong efforts are made at the time of marriage to ensure the validity of the witnesses and {{the marriage}} ceremony. Another possibility is to prove that the woman did not consent to the marriage clearly and of her own free will, so that the marriage ceremony is declared invalid. This too is not generally accepted amongst the halakhic authorities as there is generally no method to disprove intent. It is felt that the purpose of this endeavor is solely or primarily to retroactively delegitimize <b>a</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>that</b> was performed and accepted often many years previously. Annulling the marriage has no impact on the status of the woman's children. However, since it is not a generally accepted mechanism, it may leave the wife susceptible to a halakhic ruling that she was still married, and any subsequent relations with another man to be adultery. And it may lead to other halakhic problems, so it is only used as a last resort by the authorities that do accept its use.|$|E
25|$|Government {{marriage}} {{officers who}} have an objection of conscience to solemnising same-sex marriages may note this objection in writing to the Minister of Home Affairs, {{and if they do}} so they cannot be compelled to solemnise same-sex marriages. (This provision does not apply to religious marriage officers because they are in any case not obliged to solemnise <b>a</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>that</b> would violate the doctrines of their religion.) Several constitutional scholars have argued that this provision is unconstitutional, representing as it does state-sanctioned discrimination in violation of the right to equality. In September 2016, almost a decade after same-sex marriage was legalized in South Africa, the Department of Home Affairs released a list of marriage offices across the country that are willing to solemnise same-sex marriages. According to the list, of the 409 marriage offices only 117 (or 28.6%) are willing to do so. In Gauteng, 17 out of 57 offices said they would conduct same-sex marriages, 10 out of 59 in the Eastern Cape, 5 out of 28 in the Free State, 10 out of 58 in Mpumalanga, 16 out of 61 in Limpopo, 10 out of 34 in the Western Cape, 9 out of 22 in the Northern Cape, 29 out of 68 in KwaZulu-Natal and 10 out of 22 in North West. Following its release, Minister of Home Affairs Malusi Gigaba said the list {{was just one of the}} strategies that the Department had undertaken to resolve the issue, which include increasing sensitisation of Home Affairs officials and ensuring that LGBT people are treated respectfully and according to policies and laws by staff.|$|E

500|$|For most {{of their}} married life, George and Bessie Lansbury lived in Bow, {{originally}} in St Stephen's Road and, from 1916, at 39 Bow Road, a house which, Shepherd records, became [...] "a political haven" [...] for those requiring assistance of any kind. Bessie died in 1933, after 53 years of <b>a</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>that</b> had produced 12 children between 1881 and 1905.

After the death of his first wife Minnie in 1922, Edgar married Moyna Macgill, an actress from Belfast; their daughter Dame Angela Lansbury, born in 1925, became a famous stage and screen actress. George Lansbury's youngest daughter Violet (1900–71) was an active CPGB member in the 1920s, who lived and worked in Moscow for many years. She married Clemens Palme Dutt, the brother of the prominent Marxist intellectual Rajani Palme Dutt.|$|E

(One year after his wife's 1978 death, he married Linda Robinson, a longtime librarian at the Dallas Public Library, in <b>a</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>that</b> lasted until Stanley Marcus's own death in 2002.) In 1935 the Marcuses commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright to design a home for them on Nonesuch Road, but rejected the eventual design, which included cantilevered steel beams and terraces swathed in mosquito netting. Instead, the couple chose a design by local firm DeWitt & Washburn, whose creation became a Texas Historic Landmark. As of 1937, Marcus was one of only 22 Texans to earn a salary of $50,000 or more, according to the House Ways and Means Committee; his father, Herbert, was another, earning $75,000 as company president while vice president Stanley drew an even $50,000.|$|E

My writing is my child and I don't want anything to come between us." [...] She has elaborated elsewhere that she enjoys living alone because it gives her time to think and write.
