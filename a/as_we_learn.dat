Bill's seemingly mundane life, narrated in humorous and dramatic anecdotes, gradually grows dark <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> he may be suffering from a possibly fatal mental disorder.|$|E
25|$|In the Nineties, the Romancière {{had created}} a new hero, Venetian Prince, Aldo Morosini a kind of Simon Templar, his “Highness Aldo Morosini” expert on {{historic}} precious stones. The origination of the Aldo Morosini Novels is unique, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> from the author herself in her foreword in the Novel Les Treize Vents (English: The thirteen Winds). She was asked by a famous French actor to write a script for an adventure story for a television series, {{with him in the}} leading role. The only condition he made: it should play in modern times and in Venice.|$|E
25|$|The {{territory}} of Beneventum under the Roman Empire was of very considerable extent. Towards the west it included that of Caudium, {{with the exception}} of the town itself; to the north it extended as far as the river Tamarus (modern Tammaro), including the village of Pago Veiano, which, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> from an inscription, was anciently called Pagus Veianus; on the northeast it comprised the town of Aequum Tuticum (modern Sant'Eleuterio, near Castelfranco in Miscano), and on the east and south bordered on the territories of Aeclanum and Abellinum. An inscription has preserved to us the names of several of the pagi or villages dependent upon Beneventum, but their sites cannot be identified.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. In 2007, Patrick Enright of MSNBC called the episode his eighth {{favorite of the}} show. He praised the references to Terminator 2 in the episode, as well as Lisa's self-referential quote about how, [...] "by next week, we'll be {{back to where we}} started from, ready for another wacky adventure." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought the episode had [...] "some great existential musings" [...] from Lisa. They added that it also [...] "contains some nice moments highlighting the differences between the Simpsons and the Flanders." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said: [...] "I always remembered [...] to be a great episode – and I recalled correctly. Sure, the show goes with a less than creative presence; it’s an easy story to make characters behave in atypical ways. However, the development of the theme is terrific, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> the friendship of Homer Simpson is worse than the antagonism of Homer Simpson." [...] DVD Talk gave the episode a 4 out of 5 score. Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B grade, claiming the [...] "rather large dose of sentimentality" [...] and [...] "fewer moments of absurdity" [...] in the episode gave it [...] "the feeling that it belongs in one of the series' earlier seasons". The Orlando Sentinels Gregory Hardy named it the second best episode of the show with a sports theme.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concept of}} the Messiah is {{important}} in Christianity. Originally an earthly king ruling by divine appointment ("the anointed one", as the title Messiah had it), the [...] "son of David" [...] became {{in the last two}} pre-Christian centuries the apocalyptic and heavenly one who would deliver Israel and usher in a new kingdom. This was the background to the concept of Messiahship in early Christianity, which interpreted the career of Jesus [...] "by means of the titles and functions assigned to David in the mysticism of the Zion cult, in which he served as priest-king and in which he was the mediator between God and man". The early Church believed that [...] "the life of David [...] the life of Christ; Bethlehem is the birthplace of both; the shepherd life of David points out Christ, the Good Shepherd; the five stones chosen to slay Goliath are typical of the five wounds; the betrayal by his trusted counsellor, Achitophel, and the passage over the Cedron remind us of Christ's Sacred Passion. Many of the Davidic Psalms, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> from the New Testament, are clearly typical of the future Messiah." [...] In the Middle Ages, [...] "Charlemagne thought of himself, and was viewed by his court scholars, as a 'new David'. [...] not in itself a new idea, but [...] content and significance were greatly enlarged by him". The linking of David to earthly kingship was reflected in later Medieval cathedral windows all over Europe through the device of the Tree of Jesse, its branches demonstrating how divine kingship descended from Jesse, through his son David, to Jesus.|$|E

40|$|Vowels are the {{backbone}} of any language for without them {{there can be no}} speech <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it. A vowel, as opposed to a consonant, is a speech sound produced without stopping or obstructing the flow of air from the lungs.

60|$|Then {{came the}} heavy, {{deafening}} roll of thunder. Even {{in the darkness}} I fancied I could see Hiram put all his weight and strength upon the oaken lever, and I believed that the bars gave way; but so heavy was the cannonading in the heavens that I could hear no sound, yet, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> an instant later, he had not only fetched away the iron screen, but crashed through {{the glass of the}} window.|$|R
60|$|The next morning, {{when all}} {{supposed}} {{that we were}} fairly embarked for a long cruise, our course was suddenly altered for La Dominica, or Hivarhoo, an island {{just north of the}} one we had quitted. The object of this, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>learned,</b> was to procure, if possible, several English sailors, who, according to the commander of the corvette, had recently gone ashore there from an American whaler, and were desirous of shipping aboard one of their own country vessels.|$|R

6000|$|His way of composing, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> from Gray's remarks {{upon his}} poems, was to cast down his first {{thoughts}} carelessly, and at large, and then clip them {{here and there}} at leisure. [...] "This method," [...] as his friend observed, [...] "will leave behind it a laxity, a diffuseness. The force of a thought (otherwise well-invented, well-turned, and well-placed) is often weakened by it." [...] He might have added, that it is apt to give to poetry the air of declamation.|$|E
40|$|Are the new {{families}} we {{are studying}} now really ‘new’? Some historical examples about English and American intellectuals living in Europe {{suggest that the}} most varied arrangements were made by couples or social groups that, nevertheless, continued to present themselves as ‘families’. And also to document their genealogies in the most traditional form, ‘forgetting’ the relationships that did not produced descendants or, even if they did, were most unconventional. It is also worth asking if the formal structure of the genealogies, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> to express them, do not induce this erasure of history...|$|R
60|$|My {{men were}} all armed now with both rifles and pistols, each having plenty of ammunition.

6000|$|... 10. Deputy Vice-Treasurer of Ireland.

In 1702 he obtained the Queen's leave to be absent from the regiment when it was sent to the West Indies. Pratt seems to have been introduced to Swift by Addison.|$|E
6000|$|It {{seems that}} some critics cannot divest {{themselves}} {{of the idea that}} [...] "the original poet" [...] of the [...] "kernel" [...] was contemporary with them who slept in the shaft graves of Mycenae, covered with golden ornaments, and that for body armour he only knew their monstrous shields. Mr. Leaf writes: [...] "The armour of Homeric heroes corresponds closely to that of the Mykenaean age <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> it from the monuments.

60|$|As he {{was entirely}} alone, {{it may be}} presumed that, in these remarks, Mr Swiveller {{addressed}} himself to his fate or destiny, whom, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> by the precedents, it is the custom of heroes to taunt in a very bitter and ironical manner when they find themselves in situations of an unpleasant nature. This is the more probable from the circumstance of Mr Swiveller directing his observations to the ceiling, which these bodily personages are usually supposed to inhabit--except in theatrical cases, when {{they live in the}} heart of the great chandelier.|$|E

5000|$|Man is a mimetic animal. Man {{loves to}} use his {{imagination}} (and not only to make laws and run town councils).

30|$|At {{the time}} Akatsuki arrived at Venus, {{approximately}} 6  years {{had passed since}} the cryo-cooler was charged with pressurized helium gas; thus, contamination due to outgassing was almost unavoidable.
