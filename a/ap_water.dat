40|$|Life {{cycles of}} diatoms in polar regions {{comprise}} various stages {{in which the}} frustules of vegetative cells are discarded. These include gametangial stages during the sexual phase and the transition to stages such as resting spores/cells or winter forms. Diatoms from untreated samples from water, deep-water, sediment traps or surface sediment were identified, counted and measured. Biogenic silica content was analysed from water and sediment traps samples. Antarctic Peninsula (<b>AP)</b> <b>water</b> column and shelf surface sediment samples were taken from an autumn cruise (ANTXVIII/ 5 b). Greenland Sea (GS) samples were taken from 3 years' sediment trap deployments, 2 autumn and 1 summer cruise during ARKTIEFII. Proboscia inermis (21 %) and Corethron pennatum (17 %) dominated biomass at the AP during an autumn bloom (2. 5 mgChla/m 3). Massive sexual reproduction was detected in both species besides the formation of winter stages in P. inermis. Male gametes and winter forms are liberated from vegetative frustules. Eucampia antarctica winter forms were discarding the vegetative theca and rudimentary valve and Odontella weissflogii was observed only as resting spores also discarding the vegetative remnant cell wall. The latter species were present in lower numbers. At the GS Rhizosolenia hebetata f. semispina, Proboscia eumorpha and Fragilariopsis cf. cylindriformis were the only important diatom species. The former two were passing through a sexual phase in which male gametangial frustules were being discarded. R. hebetata f. semispina auxospores undergo a further transformation into R. h. f. hiemalis which discards the rudimentary auxospore wall. Sinking events of empty halves of frustules and remnants were recorded in sediment traps (GS) and observed in the surface sediment samples (AP). The comparison of the specific size-frequency distributions of the width of empty halves found sedimented with that from intact cell walls {{in the water column}} was made for both regions. The matching of these size-frequency distributions, the observation of auxospores, gametangial cells and resting cells, releasing high amounts of empty cell walls, in conjunction with the analysis of BSi profiles and BSi measurements in the trapped material provides evidence that life cycles of these big diatom species can drive the silica flux. Analysis of the constituents of diatoms in the high latitudes areas studied led to the conclusion that a large portion of biogenic silica transported to depth {{is directly related to the}} remnants of diatom life cycle stages. Consideration of these processes can help to clarify the high Si:C ratios commonly found in high latitude sinking matter...|$|E

Through computational simulations of isolated 2 AP and a series of 2 AP-water clusters, we show that the experimentally-observed dependence of the excited-state lifetime of 2 AP on the number and location of water molecules is controlled by a barrier for internal conversion between the S- 1 minimum and a conical intersection. Other possible competing pathways (proton transfer, intersystem crossing, and internal conversion at other intersections) were also investigated but discarded. The tuning of the luminescence of 2 <b>AP</b> by <b>water</b> is related to the order of the n pi* and pi pi* states. When a water molecule interacts with the amino group, the pathway from the S 1 minimum to the conical intersection requires a nonadiabatic change, thus increasing the energy barrier for internal conversion.

50|$|The uplands of Krishna {{river basin}} located in Maharashtra and Karnataka are {{situated}} on the Deccan Traps which comprises thick seems of basalt rock formations. Basalt rock is prone to chemical weathering contributing more TDS to the river water. Water is not safe for drinking if the TDS exceeds 500 mg/l. The average yearly salt export requirement is nearly 12 million tons in Krishna basin area up to Prakasam Barrage. At least 850 TMC water is required for salt export purpose to maintain water TDS below 500 mg/l. This is including 360 TMC of Krishna river water being used outside the Krishna basin in <b>AP.</b> This <b>water</b> used outside the basin area is also serving the salt export purpose since salts are transferred outside the basin.

Materials and Methods: This study was conducted from January 2010 to October 2013. Twenty-three patients (5 men and 18 women; mean age, 43. 96 years old) with SOA and 19 patients (3 men and 16 women; mean age, 41. 74 years old) with MCN were included in this retrospective study. Two types of features were collected by dual-energy spectral CT imaging as follows: conventional and additional quantitative spectral CT features. Classification results of the CAD scheme were compared using the conventional features and full feature data set. Important features were selected using support vector machine classification method combined with feature-selection technique. The optimal cutoff values of selected features were determined through receiver–operating characteristic curve analyses. Results: Combining conventional features with additional spectral CT features improved the overall accuracy from 88. 37 % to 93. 02 %. The selected features of the proposed CAD scheme were tumor size, contour, location, and low-energy CT values (43 keV). Iodine–water basis material pair densities in both arterial phase (AP) and portal venous phase (PP) were important factors for differential diagnosis of SOA and MCN. The optimal cutoff values of long axis, short axis, 40 keV monochromatic CT value in <b>AP,</b> iodine (<b>water)</b> density in <b>AP,</b> 43 keV monochromatic CT value in PP, and iodine (water) density in PP were 3. 4 mm, 3. 1 mm, 35. 7 Hu, 0. 32533 mg/mL, 39. 4 Hu, and 0. 348 mg/mL, respectively. Conclusion: The combination of conventional features and additional information provided by dual-energy spectral CT shows a high accuracy in the CAD scheme. The quantitative information of spectral CT may prove useful in the diagnosis and classification of SOAs and MCNs with machine learning algorithms.
