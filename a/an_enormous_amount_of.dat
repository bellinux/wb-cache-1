How much of this was due to the effects of the night fighter force has been a matter of considerable debate among historians.

Scholars have noted several features unique to Florentine cultural life that may have caused such a cultural movement.

Many summa-rization techniques dealing with single doc-ument and multi-documents have been stud-ied. However, due to the increase of the documents which report the change of top-ics along a timeline, called time-series docu-ments, in recent years, a summarization tech-nique which generates a summary of time-series documents, called timeline summariza-tion, has been actively studied as an area of automatic summarization. There are different difficulties in summarizing time-series doc-uments from other type of automatic sum-marization. The basic approach for timeline summarization is to extract sentences which describe major events in object documents in chronological order to generate a timeline summary. However, unlike the prior studies of timeline summarization, we particularly focus on on-line summarization of time-series documents and propose an on-line graph-based timeline summarization method. With our proposed method, a summary of time-series documents can be generated at any point of time when it is required. We conduct experiments to investi-gate the ability of our proposed method, evalu-ate the results with ROUGEmetrics, and show our proposed method produces a better sum-mary compared to other representative sum-marization methods. ...|$|R

5|$|Although {{identified}} {{early as}} a vital strategic outpost, Port Moresby, the most significant Papuan town, had just two airfields and basic port facilities in early 1942. <b>An</b> <b>enormous</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> work was required to transform it into a major base for both air and land operations against the Japanese.

To make them operational, the engineers had to construct more than just runways; taxiways, hardstands, facilities and access roads all had to be built. The operation of the base depended on shipping, but the port facilities were limited. To increase the capacity of the port, a causeway was built to Tatana Island, where pontoon docks were emplaced. Engineers also built roads, warehouses, and a water treatment plant. They ran the town's electricity and water supply, and quarried stone for the roads and airstrips.|$|E

Wise, Kline and Abel had been unable to agree on how to photograph the sequence, and the result was a poorly designed and ungainly effect that Trumbull was convinced was disruptive to the plot and would have cost millions to fix. Instead, he recommended a stripped-down sequence that omitted Kirk entirely and would be simple and easy to shoot; Robert McCall, known for designing the original posters to 2001: A Space Odyssey, provided Trumbull with concept art to inform the new event.|$|E

40|$|This {{book is a}} {{collection}} of papers dedicated to the memory of Yehuda Vardi. Yehuda was the chair of the Department of Statistics of Rutgers University when he passed away unexpectedly on January 13, 2005. On October 21 [...] 22, 2005, some 150 leading scholars from many different fields, including statistics, telecommunications, biomedical engineering, bioinformatics, biostatistics and epidemiology, gathered at Rutgers in a conference in his honor. This conference was on ``Complex Datasets and Inverse Problems: Tomography, Networks, and Beyond,'' and was organized by the editors. The present collection includes research work presented at the conference, as well as contributions from Yehuda's colleagues. The theme of the conference was networks and other important and emerging areas of research involving incomplete data and statistical inverse problems. Networks are abundant around us: communication, computer, traffic, social and energy are just a few examples. <b>As</b> <b>enormous</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> network data are collected in this information age, the field has attracted a great <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> attention from researchers in statistics and computer engineering as well as telecommunication providers and various government agencies. However, few statistical tools have been developed for analyzing network data as they are typically governed by time-varying and mutually dependent communication protocols sitting on complicated graph-structured network topologies. Many prototypical applications in these and other important technologies can be viewed as statistical inverse problems with complex, massive, high-dimensional and possibly biased/incomplete data. This unifying theme of inverse problems is particularly appropriate for a conference and volume dedicated to the memory of Yehuda. Indeed he made influential contributions to these fields, especially in medical tomography, biased data, statistical inverse problems, and network tomography.

The theory, that {{a representative of the}} people ceases to be one when he acts against the wishes of the people, was counter to Roman constitutional theory. If carried to its logical end, this theory would remove all constitutional restraints on the popular will, and put the state under the absolute control of a temporary popular majority.

5|$|Barry Lyndon (1975) is an {{adaptation}} of William Makepeace Thackeray's The Luck of Barry Lyndon (also known as Barry Lyndon), a picaresque novel about the adventures of an 18th-century Irish rogue and social climber. John Calley of Warner Bros. agreed in 1972 to invest $2.5 million into the film, on condition that Kubrick approach major Hollywood stars, to ensure it of success. Like previous films, Kubrick and his art department conducted <b>an</b> <b>enormous</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> research, and he went from knowing {{very little about the}} 18th century {{at the start of the}} production to becoming an expert on it. Extensive photographs were taken of locations and artwork in particular, and paintings were meticulously replicated from works of the great masters of the period in the film. The film was shot on location in Ardmore, County Waterford, Ireland, beginning in the autumn of 1973, at a cost of $11 million with a cast and crew of 170. The decision to shoot in Ireland stemmed from the fact that it still retained many buildings from the 18th century period which England lacked. The production was problematic from the start, plagued with heavy rain and political strife involving Northern Ireland at the time. After Kubrick received death threats from the IRA in the New Year of 1974 due to the shooting scenes with English soldiers, he fled Ireland with his family on a ferry from Dún Laoghaire under an assumed identity, and filming resumed in England.|$|E

After the original was lost, only a few manuscripts survived {{as a result of}} its secretive nature. Only a few trustees of the government were ever allowed to read it as increased propagation would have increased the chance of it falling into enemy hands. A remaining copy of the Wujing Zongyao was remade into a newly published edition in 1231 AD in the Southern Song dynasty. During the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644 AD), another book was published in 1439 AD featuring fragments of the Wujing Zongyao of 1231 while omitting some material and combining it with two other books, including a preface by Li Jin. The entire Wujing Zongyao was reprinted in 1510 AD and this version is currently the oldest extant copy available. However, the historian Joseph Needham asserts that the 1510 AD edition is the most reliable in its faithfulness to the original version, since it was printed from blocks that were re-carved directly from tracings of the edition made in 1231 AD, rather than recombining fragments of the original with other material.|$|E
