Gravel flew {{up in front of}} her as the bullets hit the ground. Bryant then got in his car <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> for a few moments before getting out again and going back to the coaches. Some people were taking cover behind cars in the car park, but because of the elevation, Bryant could see them and the cars did not provide much cover. When they {{realized}} Bryant had seen them, they ran into the bush. He fired several shots. At least one hit a tree behind which someone was taking cover, but no one was hit.|$|E
500|$|Tyutcheva {{took her}} book to {{other members of}} the family. Nicholas's sister Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia was horrified by Tyutcheva's story. She wrote in her diary on 15 March 1910 that she could not {{understand}} the family's regard for Rasputin as [...] "almost a saint" [...] when she viewed him as only a [...] "khlyst". Tyutcheva told Grand Duchess Xenia that the starets visited when Olga and Tatiana were getting ready for bed <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> talking with them and [...] "caressing" [...] them. The girls hid his presence from their governess and were afraid {{to talk to her about}} Rasputin. Maria Ivanovna Vishnyakova, another nurse for the royal children, was at first a devotee of Rasputin, but later was disillusioned by him. She claimed that she was raped by Rasputin in the spring of 1910. The empress refused to believe her, Vishnyakova told investigators, and said everything Rasputin did was holy. Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna was told that Vishnyakova's claim had been immediately investigated, but [...] "they caught the young woman in bed with a Cossack of the Imperial Guard." [...] Vishnyakova was dismissed from her post in 1913.|$|E
500|$|Lo {{found the}} {{shooting}} difficult and exhausting {{because she had}} to walk around with a 22-pound camera strapped around her waist for the three days of the filming. She also stated that it was [...] "draining" [...] to represent the pain she felt when she wrote the track. At one point during the filming, Lo was drunk and tired, so {{she decided to go}} into the bathroom stall; concerning this, the singer confessed that: [...] "I was wasted and tired and it was a tough recording and I really just went into the bathroom <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> by myself. There weren't any people around then and I was just really alone in that stall. I just sat there and thought of anything that was happening during that time. The tears just came." [...] She also confessed that she barely remembered half of the recording. On 19 February 2014, she posted a teaser of the video on her Facebook account. On 17 March 2014, the music video was released via Lo's VEVO channel on YouTube, and was made available for consumption on the iTunes Store the next day.|$|E
60|$|She nodded, <b>and</b> they <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> {{in silence}} for several moments. Bellamy was {{thinking}} deeply.|$|R
60|$|You might ha' heard a pin drop a'most, <b>and</b> Charlie <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> {{without saying}} a word.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit {{down and}} I'll tell you." [...] <b>And</b> he <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> beside the candle, staring at me. [...] "There {{was a man}} always there--Count Camerino." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Crocker hoisted himself nimbly {{onto the}} writing-desk, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> beaming, with {{dangling}} legs.|$|E
60|$|She {{sank down}} again upon the divan, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> rocking {{her arms in}} a gesture of hopeless distress.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Mr. Lincoln continued, [...] "that {{was on a}} Monday, I reckon, and {{the boys}} a-shouting to have their horses shod. Maybe you think they didn't have some fun with Sam'l. But Sam'l sat there, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> {{and after a while}} the old man pulled out his dinner-pail. Sam'l never opened his mouth. First thing you know, snip went the tongs." [...] Mr. Lincoln turned gravely around. [...] "What do you reckon Sam'l said, Judge?" ...|$|E
60|$|How long Jim <b>and</b> I <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> {{we never}} knew. The second tragedy, not so pitiful but as heart sickening as the first, crushed our spirits.|$|R
60|$|We {{went into}} the parlour <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down. <b>There</b> was an old fellow there, smoking a long clay pipe, and we {{naturally}} began chatting.|$|R
60|$|So {{they chose}} good seats near the {{companion}} way, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> their husbands brought them carpet bags {{to put their}} feet upon.|$|R
60|$|Without {{even taking}} her bonnet off Mary {{dropped into a}} chair when she entered her room <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> till Margot brought in the broth.|$|E
60|$|When I had {{had enough}} walking I retired to the piazza <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> until Brownster, with a bow, came and {{informed}} me that breakfast was served.|$|E
60|$|He ate some hardtack, sauced {{with wild}} berries, {{when he reached}} the summit of the ridge, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> for some time, looking down into his home coulee.|$|E
6000|$|... "He <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> smoking, <b>and</b> I <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> thinking. Twice 'e {{spoke to}} me, and I held my 'and {{up and said}} 'H'sh.' Then I turned to 'im {{all of a sudden}} and pinched his arm so hard he nearly dropped 'is beer.|$|R
5000|$|Then I {{came to them}} of the captivity at Tel Abib, {{that lived}} by the river Chebar, and to where they lived; <b>and</b> I <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> {{overwhelmed}} among them seven days.|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't {{believe my}} ears at fust, but when I could I drew myself {{up and told}} 'im wot I thought of 'im; <b>and</b> he <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> laughed at me.|$|R
60|$|Rosamund {{sank down}} upon the divan, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> with bowed head, her hands folded in her lap. Sakr-el-Bahr stood by {{in silence for a}} long moment contemplating her.|$|E
60|$|It did {{begin to}} rain, {{the only one}} of my suppositions which came true. I hoisted an {{umbrella}} <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> grimly, in that horseless wagon in the mud-hole.|$|E
60|$|One {{evening at}} dusk, {{two weeks after}} their first meeting, Carter and Masie strolled arm-in-arm into a little, dimly-lit park. They found a bench, tree-shadowed and secluded, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
60|$|Our {{glasses were}} filled, <b>and</b> we still <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> dazed <b>and</b> dumb. Then Basil spoke.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps, Dr. Melville,' he said, 'it {{will be more}} {{reassuring to}} you if I at once hold my hands up,' <b>and</b> he <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> smiled, holding up his neatly gloved hands.|$|R
60|$|All of 'em {{thought the}} same, not knowing wot a fust-class liar the cook was, <b>and</b> he <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> lied to 'em till he couldn't 'ardly speak, {{he was so}} 'oarse.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tomassov {{could not}} see the effect it {{produced}} because the French officer lowered his head <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> contemplating his admirably polished boots. The lady whispered in a sympathetic tone: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please get up," [...] she said; for Mr. Joe, {{feeling very}} humble and very earnest, {{had gone down}} upon his knees, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> entirely {{regardless}} of his personal appearance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know. I {{slipped on}} the {{sidewalk}} and turned my ankle. I could not walk, so I hobbled into a restaurant <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> until I was better. That is why I was so long." ...|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile Fan {{had gone}} to her corner and removed her old hat and kicked off her muddy shoes, <b>and</b> now <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> {{watching}} her mother, who had despondently settled in her chair again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course not," [...] said Caspar reasonably. <b>And</b> he <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> {{with his}} air of stiff helplessness, as if not only this were true, {{but there were}} nothing else that they might discuss.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a lounge}} close at hand. She moved slowly towards it, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> down. <b>There</b> was no spoken invitation, but I {{understood}} that I {{was permitted to}} remain with her.|$|R
60|$|As {{the words}} passed his lips Jan {{let go of}} him so {{suddenly}} that Gaasha {{fell to the ground}} <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> staring at us, for without doubt he thought that we had all gone mad.|$|E
60|$|On the {{day after}} Mrs. Ray's visit to Exeter, Tappitt, as was now his almost daily practice, made his way into Mr. Honyman's little back room, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> with his hat on, {{discussing}} his affairs.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed to}} Toby {{as if the}} monkey {{understood}} just {{what he said to}} him, for he sneaked over into one corner, away from the other monkeys, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> looking very penitent and very dejected.|$|E
5000|$|According to DeLonge, [...] "the {{only way}} that you can really {{appreciate}} song is if you have headphones and you dim the lights in your house <b>and</b> really <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> listened to it." ...|$|R
60|$|It was a {{very nice}} brooch, and Mrs. Finch was so pleased with it that Ginger <b>and</b> Peter <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> as mad as they could be because they 'adn't thought of the same thing.|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{hell with}} Creech an' his hosses, but where do I come in as a man?" [...] he whispered. <b>And</b> he <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> arms tight around his knees, locked both mentally and {{physically}} into inaction.|$|R
