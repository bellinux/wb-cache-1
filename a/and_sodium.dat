40|$|The {{relationship}} between the endolymphatic potential (EP) <b>and</b> the <b>sodium</b> <b>and</b> potassium concentration gradients between endolymph and interstitial fluid was studied both by measuring the EP at varying concentrations of <b>sodium</b> <b>and</b> potassium in endolymph and by measuring {{the effect of a}} depressed EP on the concentrations of these cations.

No change in the EP accompanied these alterations. In a second series of experiments the EP was reduced from + 72 mV to + 31 mV for a mean duration of 20 min. No change in the concentration of <b>sodium</b> <b>and</b> potassium in endolymph was found during the period of reduced EP.

While potash has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts. Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence which led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702, and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} an attempt {{has been made}} to gain more insight into the {{disturbances}} in renal function <b>and</b> in <b>sodium</b> <b>and</b> water homeostasis caused by liver disease. In the general introduction, the mechanisms of <b>sodium</b> <b>and</b> water homeostasis were explained according to the concept of Borst and Guyton in which the circulation, or more in particular the arterial pressure (''fullness of the arterial system'') is the factor to be maintained by changes in the <b>sodium</b> <b>and</b> water balance. The liver's metabolic functions and its important postition in the circulation means that liver impairment can alter <b>sodium</b> <b>and</b> water homeostasis in several ways. Observations known from literature were discussed. The formation of ascites and the hyperdynamic circulation secondary to arteriovenous shunting which both can occur in liver disease, undoubtely have a great effect on <b>sodium</b> <b>and</b> water homeostasis.

5|$|Because {{potassium}} {{reacts with}} water vapor in the air, {{it is usually}} stored under anhydrous mineral oil or kerosene. Unlike lithium <b>and</b> <b>sodium,</b> however, potassium should not be stored under oil for longer than 6 months, unless in an inert (oxygen free) atmosphere, or under vacuum.
