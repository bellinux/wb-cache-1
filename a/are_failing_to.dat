2500|$|During the Test, former South African opening batsman Barry Richards bemoaned {{the lack}} of fight in the England team, commenting that [...] "...it puzzles me why {{the new breed of}} England batsmen <b>are</b> <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> stamp their {{authority}} on an innings. People like Stewart and Hick have all the ability at Test level but they do not seem to want to grab the game by the scruff of its [...] neck and say to the opposition bowlers: 'I'm here. Come and get me if you can.'". [...] meanwhile, in The Guardian, Mike Selvey praised the South African seamers, and Scyld Berry singled out Fanie De Villiers' bowling on the second day as the turning point of the match, and the above commentators pointed out England's lack of success at the home of cricket and questioned {{the lack of}} a left-handed batsman in the eleven.|$|E
2500|$|In 2017, {{a report}} by the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) found that the {{previous}} year, 2016, had been the worst on record for antisemitic hate crime in the UK. Prior to that, 2015 had been the worst year on record, and 2014 was the worst year on record before that. The report found that in 2016, antisemitic crime rose by 15% compared to 2015, or 45% compared to 2014. It also found that 1 in 10 antisemitic crimes was violent. Despite rising levels of antisemitic crime, the report said there had been a decrease in the charging of antisemitic crime. In the report's foreword, the CAA's Chairman wrote: [...] "Britain has the political will to fight antisemitism and strong laws with which to do it, but those responsible for tackling the rapidly growing racist targeting of British Jews <b>are</b> <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> enforce the law. There is a very real danger of Jewish citizens emigrating, as has happened elsewhere in Europe unless there is radical change." ...|$|E

The minister of intelligence, {{the governor of}} the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) and several other ministers are among the members of the special committee in charge of the campaign against money laundering. In 2008, the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Watchdog praised the Islamic Republic's crackdown on money laundering. The 34-member financial watchdog congratulated Tehran on its commitment to seal money laundering loopholes. However, in 2010, FATF, named Ecuador and Iran on a list of states that it says <b>are</b> <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> comply with international regulations against money laundering and financing terrorism. Despite president Hassan Rouhani showing interest in FATF, there has been a massive disagreements by hardliners related to supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Among them Ahmad Jannati, the chairman of the Assembly of Experts and the secretary of the Guardian Council and Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's former foreign secretary and Supreme leader top foreign relationship advisor are two notable people who are against the FATF. These disagreements and lack of FATF being approved by the Iranian parliament has brought FATF enforcement to halt.|$|E

2500|$|Gonzales later explained, [...] "The {{old ways}} {{may not work}} here. That's what the memo was {{intended}} to convey to the President. I never meant to convey to the President that the basic values in the Geneva Convention were outdated." [...] He noted that a British parliamentary committee visiting Guantánamo, while horrified by conditions at the base, had reached a similar conclusion when it said, [...] "the Geneva Conventions <b>are</b> <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> provide necessary protection because they lack clarity and are out of date"). He argued that existing military regulations and instructions from the President were more than adequate {{to ensure that the}} principles of the Geneva Convention would be applied. He also expressed a concern that undefined language in Common Article III of GPW, such as [...] "outrages upon personal dignity" [...] and [...] "inhuman treatment" [...] could make officials and military leaders subject to the War Crimes Act of 1996 if actions were deemed to constitute violations of the Act. Attorney General John Ashcroft made a similar argument on behalf of the Justice Department by letter to the President dated February 1, 2002, writing that a presidential determination [...] "against treaty application would provide the highest assurance that no court would subsequently entertain charges that American military officers, intelligence officials or law enforcement officials violated Geneva Convention rules relating to field conduct, detention conduct or interrogation of detainees. The War Crimes Act of 1996 makes violations of parts of the Geneva Convention a crime in the United States." ...|$|E

But the churches make no mention of their creeds. They chatter about sex and the magic effect of church attendance and simple faith. If simple faith is enough, the churches and their differences are an imposture.
