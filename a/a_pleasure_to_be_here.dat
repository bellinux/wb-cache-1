And Chattanooga Choo Choo certainly put on steam and breezed right through that million mark by over 200,000 pressings. And we decided that Glenn should get a trophy. The best one we could think of is a gold record of Chattanooga. And now Glenn, it's yours - with the best wishes of RCA Victor Bluebird records.|$|E

The topic I’d {{like to talk to}} you about today is, I think, one of the oldest and most basic in cognition: how we learn from examples. As most famously pointed out by Hume, when we make a finite number of observations of an enduring phenomenon, there is no strictly logical (i. e., deductive) basis for forming any firm generalizations about it. Instead we must “induce, ” that is, make educated guesses about what its general properties might be. The need for this is especially clear in the case of category learning, or as it is sometimes called, concept formation. We see a few examples of a category—say, a straight-backed chair, a plush armchair, and threelegged stool—and must guess the true form of th...|$|E

40|$|Gloria Vaughn, Tennesseans, Good morning. It is <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here.</b> I {{have always}} had a kindred feeling for Tennessee. I have always been I {{impressed}} by the research and demonstration projects coming from Te 1 U 1 essee which, in their concern for children, show respect for parental responsibility {{and the role of the}} family. Also, I am impressed by this turn-out, which cuts across so many professions related directly or indirectly to the development of children. I came to keynote a theme. As the title of my address says, "If you care about children, then care about parents! " As you know, it doesn't automatically happen that way, and the idea I wish to express is that the way we focus on the child [...] either as individual professionals or as a society [...] does not always support the family as the primary institution responsible for the welfare and education of children. In our eagerness to serve or to teach children, or to protect them, we are sometimes led to ignore the parents, to be insensitive to their concerns, to compet...|$|E

Our nation 2 ̆ 7 s system for taxing international income today is largely a creature of the period 1918 - 1928, a time when the income tax was itself in childhood. From the inception of the income tax (1913 for individuals, 1909 for corporations) until 1918, foreign taxes were deducted like any other business expense. In 1918, the foreign tax credit (FTC) was enacted. This unilateral decision by the United States to allow taxes paid abroad to reduce U. S. tax liability dollar for dollar—taken principally to redress the unfairness of 2 ̆ 2 double taxation 2 ̆ 2 of foreign source income—was extraordinarily generous to those nations where U. S. companies earned income. In contrast, Britain, also a large capital exporter, until the 19402 ̆ 7 s credited only foreign taxes paid within the British Empire and limited its credit to a maximum of one-half the British taxes on the foreign income...|$|E
40|$|It's <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> {{this evening}} to {{participate}} in your "Distinguished Business Leaders" lecture series. Professor Hugh Patrick has been threatening to invite me here {{for the last five}} years, and I have been threatening to accept.

A day later he sent me a letter asking if I'd like to speak about the global mergers and acquisitions markets. Taken together, these are two very important and topical issues for me, the book having served as an opportunity to think through some of the major challenges facing this country, the M&A business being at the center of my professional life. In many ways the two subjects have similar underpinnings, too, especially with respect to the rapid and deep seated political, economic and industrial changes occurring in the world.

40|$|Good afternoon. It’s <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> at the City Club. This {{beautiful}} building connects us with San Francisco’s {{history as}} a center of commerce and finance, {{which makes it a}} great place to give a talk about the economy. My subject is how the U. S. economy is doing and where it’s heading. I’ll {{take a close look at}} why the recovery has so far been somewhat lackluster, and I’ll go over measures we at the Federal Reserve recently announced aimed at boosting growth and getting us closer to our goals of maximum employment and price stability. As always, my remarks represent my own views and not those of others in the Federal Reserve System. It’s been several years since we passed through the worst financial crisis and deepest recession the nation has experienced since the Great Depression. The collapse of the housing market and the near meltdown of the financial system took an enormous toll. The past three years have been marked by sluggish growth, a severely depressed housing sector, and very high unemployment. Still, as discouraging as the economic news has been at times, there’s no doubt the economy is on the mend. Private-sector payrolls have climbed for 30 consecutive months...|$|E
40|$|It is <b>a</b> <b>{{pleasure}}</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> in Basel, {{to attend}} this fine {{conference at the}} BIS, and {{to see so many}} old friends. It is also a pleasure to have the opportunity of commenting on this paper by Richard Cooper. If you know Dick, you know that he is a stickler for definitions. Ask him to comment on a paper on the renminbi’s undervaluation, and he will question the author’s definition of “undervaluation. ” Ask him to comment on a paper on current account sustainability, and he will question the meaning of the term “sustainability. ” So it is only right that I should question what the author means by “central bank cooperation. ” In fact, Professor Cooper doesn’t provide a definition; rather, he provides a series of examples: information sharing, standards for information gathering, coordinated policy adjustments by central banks. Although illustrations are helpful, an explicit definition would still have helped to focus thought. But what I miss even more is an attempt to prioritize these forms of cooperation. Are some more productive or important than others? Are there some that we should be particularly concerned to promote? The paper is organized as a series of vignettes in central bank cooperation, bu...|$|E
40|$|It {{is indeed}} <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> on this auspicious {{occasion}} {{and to speak}} on the clinical aspects of the cancer program. I think one might begin by saying that five years is the conventional period required to evaluate any program in cancer, {{and it is not}} quite five years since passage of the act. It is in the nature of biomedical research that the fruits we recognize today have many of their roots much more than five years ago. Nevertheless, {{there have been a number}} of significant changes in clinical practice and clinical viewpoints during the past five years, and collectively I do not think these can be divorced from the National Cancer Program under the 1971 legislation. Indeed, it is reasonable to feel that without this federal support many, and probably most of them, would have been further delayed. One of the anomalies of the cancer program is that the focus of treatment is still surgery, yet most of the research is going forward in the nonsurgical fields. Probably the fastest moving field in recent years has been chemotherapy. Five years ago the treatment of acute lymphatic leukemia in children was already well advanced through the efforts of Sidney Farber and many others. Methotrexate had been demonstrate...|$|E
