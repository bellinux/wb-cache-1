Before leaving for Africa, Bond visits Gabriel Adeka—the rebel leader's brother—who runs AfriKIN, a London-based charity who send aid to Dahumni children; Gabriel tells Bond that he is not in contact with his brother Solomon, as the pair have fallen out.|$|E
5|$|Detectives began re-examining 10,000 witness statements, and {{submitting}} {{items for}} forensic tests {{not available in}} 1985. In September 2004 the back garden of a terraced council house in Willan Road, near the Broadwater Farm estate, was excavated after a tip-off. A female friend of Cynthia Jarrett, the woman whose death sparked the Broadwater Farm riot, lived <b>alone</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> house between 1984 and 1989, {{and according to the}} Evening Standard {{was one of the first}} on the scene when police raided Jarrett's house.|$|E
5|$|Hill {{represented}} Williams <b>alone</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> next race, the Monaco Grand Prix. His race ended {{early in}} a collision involving several {{cars on the}} opening lap of the race. For the following race, the Spanish Grand Prix, Williams' test driver David Coulthard was promoted to the race team alongside Hill, who won the race just four weeks after Senna's death. Twenty-six years earlier Graham Hill had won in Spain under similar circumstances for Lotus {{after the death of}} his team-mate Jim Clark. Championship leader Schumacher finished second with a gearbox fault restricting him to fifth gear, having led the early laps.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not exactly}} known how many Jews were helped by Żegota, but {{at one point in}} 1943 it had 2,500 Jewish {{children}} under its care in Warsaw <b>alone.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of the war, Sendler attempted to locate their parents but nearly all of them had died at Treblinka. It is estimated that about half of the Jews who survived the war (thus over 50,000) were aided in some shape or form by Żegota.|$|E

Jackson, finding that Kattabomman has come to see him with his troops, demands to meet him <b>alone.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> meeting, Jackson insults him and orders his arrest. Though surrounded by the British troops, Kattabomman fights and escapes, but his Minister, Thanapathi Sivasubramaniam Pillai, is captured by the British.|$|E

5|$|A {{ceremony}} is held each October 13 at the outfield wall in Oakland {{to listen to}} a taped broadcast of the final game of the 1960 World Series. The tradition was started by Squirrel Hill resident Saul Finkelstein, who at 1:05 pm on October 13, 1985, sat <b>alone</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base of the flagpole and listened to the NBC radio broadcast of Chuck Thompson and Jack Quinlan. Finkelstein continued the tradition for eight more years, until word spread and other people began attending in 1993. On October 13, 2000—the game's 40th anniversary—over 600people attended to listen to the broadcast, including Mazeroski himself. For the 50th anniversary, on October 13, 2010, a plaque honoring Mazeroski was dedicated and more than 1,000 attended the broadcast, including Mazeroski and several other former Pirates.|$|E
5|$|Out of {{fourteen}} potential water sources {{considered by the}} city – which included Lake Tahoe, the Eel River, and tributaries of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers– Hetch Hetchy was considered superior for its excellent dam site, abundant sediment-free water, lower cost and hydroelectric potential. At the time, Hetch Hetchy was an isolated, seldom visited subalpine valley, visited intermittently by gold seekers and sheepherders. However, since 1890, Hetch Hetchy Valley and the surrounding lands {{had been part of}} Yosemite National Park and thus off-limits to utility development, let <b>alone</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> grand scale proposed by the city. Even though the valley was not well known to the general public, organizations such as the Sierra Club treasured it for its spectacular beauty, often compared to that of Yosemite Valley itself. Led by naturalist and mountaineer John Muir, the Sierra Club adamantly opposed the city of San Francisco as it sought permission from the federal government to build a dam in the valley.|$|E
5|$|The Norman {{expansion}} into Wales slowed in the 12th century, but remained an ongoing {{threat to the}} remaining native rulers. In response the Welsh princes and lords began {{to build their own}} castles, usually in wood. There are indications that this may have begun from 1111 onwards under Prince Cadwgan ap Bleddyn with the first documentary evidence of a native Welsh castle being at Cymmer in 1116. These timber castles, including Tomen y Rhodwydd, Tomen y Faerdre and Gaer Penrhôs, were of equivalent quality to the Norman fortifications in the area and it can prove difficult to distinguish the builders of some sites from the archaeological evidence <b>alone.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of the 12th century the Welsh rulers began to build castles in stone, primarily in the principality of North Wales.|$|E

5|$|The {{season was}} {{continuously}} active, with six storms forming {{during the month}} of August <b>alone.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time, many storms received the distinction of being the earliest nth storm to form, such as the earliest fifth tropical storm to form in a season. Most of the records were broken in later years. During the season, the U.S. Weather Bureau issued storm and hurricane warnings for eight storms, including coastal portions of Texas, as well as from Florida to Massachusetts, forcing the evacuations of thousands of people. The deadliest storm of the season was a hurricane that struck Tampico, Mexico, killing over 184 residents. The costliest hurricane was the Chesapeake–Potomac hurricane, which caused $27 million in damage from North Carolina to New Jersey. The hurricane produced rainfall that resulted in severe crop damage in Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Zersenay's first {{road race}} of 2010 was the Lisbon Half Marathon. The organisers had {{modified}} {{the course and}} assembled a field of fast runners {{in order to facilitate}} a quick race. Despite the top five athletes all running personal best times, Zersenay was <b>alone</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> very front from 10km onwards. He fell four seconds short of the 15km world record, but significantly revised Haile Gebrselassie's four-year-old 20km world mark to 55:21, beating it by almost half a minute. Samuel Wanjiru's half marathon world record was next to fall as Zersenay crossed the line at 58:23 minutes, a clear ten seconds ahead of the previous mark.|$|E
5|$|A year earlier, Murdoch's Fox Entertainment Group {{purchased}} the Los Angeles Dodgers for $311m. Fox also held {{exclusive rights to}} Major League Baseball which meant from a strategic point of view, Murdoch’s acquisition looked more appealing. He was now able to control both programming content on his network and distribution rights to the Dodgers. For the very same reason BSkyB replicated Fox’s formula and went ahead with a takeover of a Premier League club. Manchester United thus was the unanimous choice of Murdoch and board members. The club was the most valuable in English football, making £30.1million from gate receipts and programmes in 1997 <b>alone.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, more than 200 supporters’ groups were established worldwide and the club's fanbase exceeded 100million, despite only a million having been to Old Trafford to watch the first team play. As a means of capitalising on this growing market, MUTV, a television station operated by the club was launched in August 1998. In co-operation with Granada Media Group and BSkyB it was the world’s first channel dedicated to a football club, funded entirely through subscriptions. On the pitch United's success was largely down to the nurturing talents of manager Ferguson, who assembled a team capable of dominating in the long haul.|$|E

5|$|The first {{attacks on}} the final climb came from Barguil and Van Avermaet, {{followed}} by Yates, while Rodríguez and Valverde waited in the main group. Yates passed Barguil and was chasing Van Avermaet, {{who was in the}} lead of the race. Towards the top of the climb, however, Van Avermaet was hit from behind by one of the motorbikes providing television coverage of the race. He was knocked to the ground and the frame of the bike was broken; Van Avermaet was unable to finish the race. Yates therefore led the race <b>alone</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of the final climb as the race descended into San Sebastián. Unlike in the 2014 race, when he had crashed out of the lead group on the final descent, Yates extended his lead to 15 seconds as the road flattened out and was able to keep this advantage {{to the end of the}} race. As he crossed the finish line, Yates was unaware that he had won the race, as he believed that the initial breakaway had not been caught. It took some time for the message to come through from his team that he had won. In the group behind, Gilbert sprinted to second place ahead of Valverde.|$|E

25|$|Politically {{there was}} a degree of unity between Muslim and Hindu leaders after World War I, as typified by the Khilafat Movement. Relationships cooled sharply after that {{campaign}} ended in 1922. Communalism grew rapidly, forcing the two groups apart. Major riots broke out in numerous cities, including 91 in U.P. <b>alone.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> leadership level, the proportion of Muslims among delegates to Congress fell sharply, from 11% in 1921 to under 4% in 1924.|$|E

25|$|Israel's Jewish {{population}} {{continued to}} grow {{at a very high}} rate for years, fed by waves of Jewish immigration from round the world, most notably the massive immigration wave of Soviet Jews, which arrived to Israel in the early 1990s following the dissolution of the USSR, who, according to the Law of Return, were entitled to become Israeli citizens upon arrival. About 380,000 arrived in 1990–1991 <b>alone.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time some 80,000–100,000 Ethiopian Jews have immigrated to Israel since the early 1980s.|$|E
