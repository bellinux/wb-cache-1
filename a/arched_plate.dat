40|$|The {{theme of}} the master´s theses is to design a wooden {{structure}} of city theater with internal steel construction. The concept of wooden structure is developed in two versions according to standard ČSN EN. The theses solve the static effect of the construction and design of individual parts and materials. Theater has dimensions 49. 0 x 25. 6 m, max. height of 12. 5 meters. The construstion is devise to withstand a weight and applicability. The supporting structure of the roof is solved using by 13 <b>arched</b> <b>plate</b> girders. The second variant is designed as arched truss girders. The gable wall is glassed-in, glass envelopes support by wooden structure with columns and side runners. The work also includes solutions for joins and construction details. The structure was solved in the program RSTAB Dlubal 8. The assessment of the components was done using additional module TIMBER Pro. First Variant of plate girder was checking by manual report.

40|$|The {{surface of}} a typical {{stringed}} instrument’s <b>arched</b> <b>plate</b> is a complex surface indeed. Experienced plate carvers and first timers possessed of highly refined spatial perception tend to implement these with some ease, while for others even the prospect of rendering such a plate is just too intimidating. This paper proposes a method by which the contours of such plates may be specified. It is a step-by-step design approach which can yield a topographic contour specification such as found in topographic maps * for a plate of arbitrary outline. The resulting specification can be directly transferred to a plate blank which is then rough carved with a router to yield a close approximation of the finished plate’s contours, such that only minor additional carving is necessary. The method described is derived from a feature of advanced Computer Aided Design (CAD) facilities called Parametric Solid Modeling (PSM). Using PSM a designer may completely specify the dimensions of a complex solid by specifying the values of {{a relatively small number}} of parameters. Folks with a non-technical bent need not be put off by the derivation of the contour specification method to be described, as no CAD or math is required to use it. The method described is a modification and simplification of the CAD-based method I use to develop arching profiles for new instruments, modified and simplified so as to be useable with pencil and paper. As CAD software is increasingly used in lutherie, the method is also described such that it can be performed using basic 2 D CAD software as well. The method begins with the specification of the values of a small number of parameters which describe the plate contours. These parameters are: 1. Outline of the plate; 2. Location of the apex (highest point) of the arch; 3. Thickness of the plate at its edge; 4. Height of the apex of the arch; 5. Contour interval (the size of the step in elevation to be indicated by each contour line); 6. Nominal horizontal arching profile; For the most part these are self-explanatory, although the last needs to be explained in detail and receives special attention in subsequent paragraphs. *A short but very good explanation of topographic maps can be found on line a...|$|E

40|$|Certain {{ferroelectric}} materials possess dual electrostrictive and piezoelectric characteristics, {{depending on}} their specific Curie temperatures. The nonlinear electro-mechanical effect of electrostrictive materials provides stronger actuation performance as {{compared with that of}} piezoelectric materials. Due to the complexity of the generic ferroelectric actuators, micro-electromechanics, structure-electronic (structronic) coupling and control characteristics of hybrid electrostrictive/piezoelectric dynamic systems deserve an in-depth investigation. In this study, dynamic electro-mechanical system equations and boundary conditions of hybrid electrostrictive/piezoelectric double-curvature shell continua are derived using the energy-based Hamilton’s principle, elasticity theory, electrostrictive/piezoelectric constitutive relations, and Gibb’s free energy function. These governing equations clearly reveal the coupling of electrostrictive, piezoelectric, and elastic fields and characteristics change triggered by the Curie temperature. The electric terms are used to manipulate and to control the static/dynamic behavior of hybrid electrostrictive/piezoelectric shells. To apply the hybrid shell system equations to other geometries, simplification procedures using two Lamé parameters and two radii of curvature are demonstrated in two cases: A hybrid electrostrictive/piezoelectric conical shell and a hybrid electrostrictive/piezoelectric toroidal shell. Following the same procedures, one can apply the generic system equations to other common geometries, e. g., beams, <b>arches,</b> <b>plates,</b> rings, cylindrical shells, spherical shells, etc., or specific materials, e. g., electrostrictive or piezoelectric, and further evaluate their electromechanical characteristics and actuation/control effectiveness. �DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 2149397...|$|R

40|$|Assuming {{orthotropic}} behavior, {{material properties}} are easily de-termined for violin blanks made of spruce and of maple. Theoretical calculations, {{by a computer}} program for the finite element method (FEM), are compared with experiments. An FFrmodel of a violin plate, symmetri-cal along the center line (the glue joint), is used when calculating the eigenmodes. Shape and frequency of the first six modes are studied when 1) <b>plate</b> <b>arching,</b> 2) <b>plate</b> thickness and thickness distribution, 3) material parameters for spruce and maple, and 4) boundary conditions of the plate are used as parameters. Results are presented in figures and tables. For comparison a violin top and a violin back plate are made of blanks with the material properties as and measures close {{to those of the}} FE-model. Calculated and experimentally determined modal shapes and frequencies are found to be close- the frequencies differ often much less than 8 %. Thus, we believe that the calculated dependence on prop-erties on different parameters of the violin plate can be trusted. Pules to adjust thickness and arching are discussed starting from material properties of the blanks. Such information is needed by the violin maker aiming at specific frequencies for certain eigenmodes for the free-free plate. It is also shown that changes in boundary condi-tions affect modes of vibration strongly. 1...|$|R
40|$|Usually {{plates of}} {{rectangular}} shape are supplied by steel mills, which are cut into required odd shapes and then weld to manufacture Fans, Air- preheaters and Electrostatic precipitators of {{thermal power plant}} manufacturing units. In fabrication industries, for both low alloy and plain carbon steel plates of odd shapes excessive residual magnetism is a bottleneck in the welding process. Welding {{can not be done}} in plates having excessive residual magnetism due to spitting and throwing of molten metal of the filler rod by magnetic polarization. Even though in theory lot of methods were told about demagnetization, in practical due to odd shapes like curved and <b>arch</b> shape <b>plates,</b> the behavior of magnetic field is very peculiar. Gradually removing the plate from magnetic field of a magnetizing source is a common method, but this will not work out because of the odd shape. The other method of slowly reducing the magnetic field and changing the polarity will also fail due to shifting of polarity {{from one end to the}} other end of the plate. In the absence of any standard procedure to meet this demagnetization process, separate effective and easy process method is required to be established. This paper describes a simple and effective application of demagnetization procedure for particularly curved and <b>arch</b> shaped steel <b>plates...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{basis of}} this work is a novel {{symbiosis}} of mechanics of solids and spherical geometry to quantify and illustrate the variation of the “non-membrane” percentage of the strain energy in the prebuckling region of linear elastic beams, <b>arches,</b> <b>plates</b> and shells, and structures assembled of such one-dimensional and two-dimensional members. The zenith angle of an arbitrary point of a specific curve on an octant of the unit sphere, called buckling sphere, is related to this energy percentage. For the limiting case of buckling from a membrane stress state this curve degenerates to a point, characterized by zero values of both spherical coordinates. For all other stress states the azimuth angle increases with the proportionally increasing load. Its magnitude at the stability limit correlates with a global quantity that depends on both the “non-membrane” deformations and the stiffness of the structure at incipient buckling. The azimuth angle is computed {{with the help of}} the so-called consistently linearized eigenproblem, which is solved by means of the Finite Element Method. This eigenvalue problem is the basis for a hypothesis for the “non-membrane” percentage of the strain energy. In the theoretical part of the paper, the concept of the buckling sphere is presented. The subsequent numerical investigation consists of four examples, referring to buckling from a membrane stress state, a pure bending stress state, and a general stress state. The practical motive for this research is the intention to investigate the influence of “non-membrane” action just before buckling on the initial postbuckling behavior of elastic structures...|$|R
