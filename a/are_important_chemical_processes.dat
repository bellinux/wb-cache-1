40|$|Due to {{diminishing}} petroleum reserves, {{unsteady market}} {{situation and the}} environmental concerns associated with utilization of fossil resources, the utilization of renewables for production of energy and chemicals (biorefining) has gained considerable attention. Biomass is the only sustainable source of organic compounds that has been proposed as petroleum equivalent {{for the production of}} fuels, chemicals and materials. In fact, it would not be wrong to say that the only viable answer to sustainably convene our future energy and material requirements remain with a bio-based economy with biomass based industries and products. This has prompted biomass valorization (biorefining) to become an important area of industrial research. While many disciplines of science are involved in the realization of this effort, catalysis and knowledge of chemical technology are considered to be particularly important to eventually render this dream to come true. Traditionally, the catalyst research for biomass conversion has been focused primarily on commercially available catalysts like zeolites, silica and various metals (Pt, Pd, Au, Ni) supported on zeolites, silica etc. Nevertheless, the main drawbacks of these catalysts are coupled with high material cost, low activity, limited reusability etc. – all facts that render them less attractive in industrial scale applications (poor activity for the price). Thus, there is a particular need to develop active, robust and cost efficient catalytic systems capable of converting complex biomass molecules. Saccharification, esterification, transesterification and acetylation <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>processes</b> in the valorization chain of biomasses (and several biomass components) for production of platform chemicals, transportation fuels, food additives and materials. In the current work, various novel acidic carbons were synthesized from wastes generated from biodiesel and allied industries, and employed as catalysts in the aforementioned reactions. The structure and surface properties of the novel materials were investigated by XRD, XPS, elemental analysis, SEM, TEM, TPD and N 2 -physisorption techniques. The agro-industrial waste derived sulfonic acid functionalized novel carbons exhibit excellent catalytic activity in the aforementioned reactions and easily outperformed liquid H 2 SO 4 and conventional solid acids (zeolites, ion-exchange resins etc). The experimental results indicated strong influence of catalyst pore-structure (pore size, pore-volume), concentration of –SO 3 H groups and surface properties in terms of the activity and selectivity of these catalysts. Here, a large pore catalyst with high –SO 3 H density exhibited the highest esterification and transesterification activity, and was successfully employed in biodiesel production from fatty acids and low grade acidic oils. Also, a catalyst decay model was proposed upon biodiesel production and could explain that the catalyst loses its activity mainly due to active site blocking by adsorption of impurities and by-products. The large pore sulfonated catalyst also exhibited good catalytic performance in the selective synthesis of triacetin via acetylation of glycerol with acetic anhydride and out-performed the best zeolite H-Y with respect to reusability. It also demonstrated equally good activity in acetylation of cellulose to soluble cellulose acetates, with the possibility to control cellulose acetate yield and quality (degree of substitution, DS) by a simple adjustment of reaction time and acetic anhydride concentration. In contrast, the small pore and highly functionalized catalysts obtained by hydrothermal method and from protein rich waste (Jatropha de-oiled waste cake, DOWC), were active and selective in the esterification of glycerol with fatty acids to monoglycerides and saccharification of cellulosic materials, respectively. The operational stability and reusability of the catalyst was found to depend on the stability of –SO 3 H function (leaching) as well as active site blocking due to adsorption of impurities during the reaction. Thus, our results corroborate the potential of DOWC derived sulfated mesoporous active carbons as efficient integrated solid acid catalysts for valorization of biomass to platform chemicals, biofuel, bio-additive, surfactants and celluloseesters...|$|E

Individual aerosol particles mainly contained secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA – sulfate and nitrate) and organics during clean periods (PM 2. 5 mass concentration less than 2. 5 μg m − 3). The presence of K–Na–Cl associated with organics {{and an increase in}} soot particles suggest that an intense biomass burning event caused the highest PM 2. 5 concentrations (> 30 μg m − 3) during the study. A large number fraction of the fly-ash-containing particles (21. 73 %) suggests that coal combustion emissions in the QTP significantly contributed to air pollutants at the medium pollution level (PM 2. 5 : 10 – 30 μg m − 3).

40|$|A {{microscopic}} {{study of}} the non‐Markovian (or memory) effects on the collective orientational relaxation in a dense dipolar liquid is carried out by using an extended hydrodynamic approach which provides a reliable description of the dynamical processes occuring at the molecular length scales. Detailed calculations of the wave‐vector dependent orientational correlation functions are presented. The memory effects are found {{to play an important}} role; the non‐Markovian results differ considerably from that of the Markovian theory. In particular, a slow long‐time decay of the longitudinal orientational correlation function is observed for dense liquids which becomes weaker {{in the presence of a}} sizeable translational contribution to the collective orientational relaxation. This slow decay can be attributed to the intermolecular correlations at the molecular length scales. The longitudinal component of the orientational correlation function becomes oscillatory in the underdamped limit of momenta relaxations and the frequency dependence of the friction reduce the frictional resistance on the collective excitations (commonly known as dipolarons) to make them long lived.

40|$|The {{prevention}} of scale <b>is</b> an <b>important</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> in many commercial applications, {{such as water}} purification, electricity generation, and chemical production. Scale prevention <b>is</b> especially <b>important</b> {{in the area of}} oil and gas production, where scale formation can restrict or completely block fluid flow in a well. One economical way to prevent scale buildup in oil and gas wells is through an inhibitor squeeze treatment, where scale inhibitor chemical is injected into the producing formation. The concentration of inhibitor returning with the brine inhibits scaling. This return concentration is currently unpredictable, because the interaction between the inhibitor and the rock forming minerals have not been quantified. Thus, treatment can neither be controlled, optimized, nor predicted. In the current research, surface complexation, solubility, and phase transformation theory are used to quantify the inhibitor-rock interactions. Solubility and adsorption equilibrium constants of the chemical components in commercial Nitrilotri (methylene phosphonic acid), NTMP, have been determined from laboratory experiments or obtained from the literature. The precipitation and solubility of calcium-NTMP salts were observed to vary with experimental conditions and with extent of aging. This observation was similar to observations made with calcium phosphate precipitation. The equilibrium constants obtained were used to evaluate the chemical conditions in the formation during an inhibitor squeeze at the Texaco N. R. Smith # 4 well. Results suggested that Ca 2. 5 HNTMP* 2 H 2 O and CaHPO 3 * 1. 5 H 2 O were in equilibrium with the return brine. The results also suggested that the relative concentration of the chemical components in the commercial product differed in the return brine. The equilibrium constants were also incorporated in a simplified transport equation to simulate the squeeze process.

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{concerns}} {{certain aspects}} of the production of CCN. In-cloud oxidation followed by cloud droplet evaporation <b>is</b> an <b>important</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> where sulfate <b>is</b> produced, and only particles with radii bigger than a certain critical radius (rc) can go through this process. 	The original interval for the critical radius (rcmin = 0. 05 ìm, rcmax = 0. 2 ìm) has led to an overestimation of the concentration of CCN. The aim is therefore to develop a new parameterization of the critical radius {{and at the same time}} keep the consistency with realistic supersaturations in different types of clouds. An interval for the critical radius must be used because of the great variability of supersaturations. 	Based on the assumption that the critical radius must equal the critical radius for activation of CCN, two sets of intervals has been developed where the first is consistent with a marine background (rcmin = 0. 033 ìm, rcmax = 0. 060 ìm), and the second is consistent with a continental background (rcmin = 0. 044 ìm, rcmax = 0. 16 ìm). These results were implemented in NCAR CCM 3 (CCM-Oslo), from which results concerning cloud droplet concentration, effective cloud droplet radius an short wave indirect cloud forcing were made for the year of 2001. 	Comparisons have been made with earlier results where the original interval of the critical radius has been used. Both the marine and the continental values of the critical radius are smaller than the original values, with the marine values being the smallest. This led to a greater global mean of the cloud droplet concentration (123. 4 cm- 3 for the marine rc-interval), a smaller global mean of the effective cloud droplet radius (10. 6 ìm for the marine rc-interval) and a greater short wave cloud forcing (- 54. 82 Wm- 2 for the marine rc-interval). 	Considerable parts of South-America, Northern and Central parts of Africa and Northern parts of Australia proved to have smaller concentrations of cloud droplets, and hence larger effective droplet radius and smaller short wave cloud forcing, for the smallest choice of rcmin. The biases were small, especially for the cloud droplet concentration, and are probably results of a numerical error in the parameterizations of aerosol properties...|$|R

In trigeneration design, the influences of demand variations at different time periods on the overall system performance have been demonstrated. Feasibility and flexibility evaluations of different design options allow the achievement of proper design decisions so as to meet the changing demand needs economically. Due to the existing difficulties in LTHEN computation, a systematic approach for design optimization is developed. This approach combines the Pinch analysis and mathematical programming to synthesis the heat exchanger network. This eases feasible LTHEN construction at different flexibility levels. In batch process design, a novel mathematical formulation is proposed to demonstrate how discrete operations can be modeled with a continuous operation zone.

A major portion of this project {{is devoted to the}} hydrology of Lake Powell, the largest recent modification in the region. This hydrologic research is separated into the following subprojects and administrative institutions: Subprojects: Streamflow Trends, Evaporation, Bank Storage / Institution: University of California at Los Angeles. Subprojects: Sedimentation, Physical Limnology, Lake Geochemistry / Institution: Dartmouth College. The project is now concluding its first year of full-scale research effort. The UCLA subprojects are aimed at developing an overall water budget for the lake, both on an annual and long -term basis. The Streamflow_trends study indicates that the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) has shifted from a few extraordinarily wet decades in the early 1900 's to several relatively dry decades up to the present. Evaporation efforts so far are toward installing a data collection system capable of furnishing data for mass-transfer and energy-budget calculations. The bank-storage study indicates that bank storage constitutes a large fraction of the impounded waters. Secondary as well as primary permeability may be of major importance in bank storage. The Evaporation and Bank Storage subprojects are working in close coordination with the Bureau of Reclamation. The Sedimentation subproject has shown that the rate may be in general agreement with earlier estimates from river flow and suspended sediment data.

40|$|The fountainhead {{to develop}} the {{chemical}} science is the demand of various compounds by human being. While most of the requirements concerns organic molecules, organometallic compounds have paved the way of homogeneous catalysis in producing bulk, fine chemicals, and even natural products. During the last decade, ruthenium catalysts have provided new indispensable synthetic methods that cannot be promoted by other catalysts and applied in wide range of chemical reactions. This work deals {{with the development of}} O,N-bidentate ruthenium homogeneous catalysts for isomerization and kinetic studies of ruthenium cabenes for C=C coupling reactions. Specifically designed ligands are the key in optimizing the efficiency of catalysts. Schiff bases are known to strongly enhance the thermal and moisture stability of the corresponding complexes and isomerization <b>is</b> <b>important</b> in many <b>chemical</b> <b>processes.</b> The above reasons promote {{the first part of the}} work to concentrate on the synthesis of a novel class of homogeneous ruthenium complexes containing Schiff bases as O,N-bidentate ligands catalyzing the isomerization reaction. By a proper choice of the Schiff base, the new ruthenium complexes showed improved reactivity, selectivity and stability toward air and moisture during the isomerization reaction. The temperature and solvent tolerance was likewise substantially improved. Later, another series of analogue Schiff bases ruthenium complexes has been synthesized as isomerization catalysts and showed even better reactivity, selectivity and stability. The formation of carbon-carbon bonds is one of the most fundamental <b>chemical</b> <b>processes.</b> In this context, C=C coupling reactions (metathesis, cyclopropanation and etc.) make a significant contribution. Despite the recent advances, the search for commercially relevant catalyst systems remains challenging. The kinetic studies of ruthenium carbenes are useful for fundamental insight to design new catalysts or to improve existing catalytic systems.

40|$|Steam {{pyrolysis}} of ethane and naphtha <b>is</b> an <b>important</b> <b>chemical</b> bulk <b>process.</b> It produces ethylene and propylene, which <b>are</b> <b>important</b> base <b>chemicals.</b> In {{order to}} be competitive, crackers have to be operated at near optimal conditions. Hence, a simulation program of the process, particularly of the pyrolysis is very helpful. KTI uses and licenses such a program called SPYRO*. Development of this program has started over 20 years ago. Consequently, it uses a closed model. It has been {{the objective of this}} study to investigate the feasibility of the development of an open version of SPYRO. Here open means that the equations are written in residual form. This enhances the flexibility of the program very much. For our studies we have used the model of Froment for ethane cracking because the documentation to make an open SPYRO model was insufficient. This Froment model has been modified as to improve the modeling of the bends. It has been checked, whether the solution of this model would pose any problems. It was found that the index might become more than 1 during integration. As yet no sound physical explanation has been found for this phenomena. It also follows from investigation of the index that a start-up problem of the numerical integration exists for the original set of differential equations. We have found a more elegant method to circumvent this problem than Froment. Moreover, we were able to solve the set of equations for bad initial conditions (equal to the boundary conditions). The ordinary differential equations of the model are turned into algebraic equations using orthogonal collocation on finite elements. This allows the model to be solved with an equation solver. The results were compared with various commercial numerical integrators. Excellent agreement was found for limited numbers of sections and collocation points. The speed of solution of the linearized set of modal equations depends on the size, the sparsity and structure of the Jacobian. The latter has an enormous effect on the fill-in of the L and U decomposition matrices. We found a very satisfying structure by modification of the equations and proper arrangement in the Jacobian. On the basis of the above results we may draw the following conclusions regarding the feasibility of the development of an Open SPYRO model. Unfortunately we had to use a simple model of Froment rather than the SPYRO equations themselves. Nevertheless, we have concluded that such a development is feasible. Within a reasonable time an accurate solution will be found even with bad starting values. The computation time can be further reduced with a smart initialization procedure.

40|$|The Water-Gas Shift (WGS) {{reaction}} (CO + H 2 O → CO 2 + H 2) <b>is</b> an <b>important</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>process</b> {{for industrial}} hydrogen production. The overall {{goal of this}} project is to use kinetic experiments and in situ characterization techniques in tandem, in order to derive structure-activity relationships for various catalytic systems. These relationships facilitate the rational catalyst design by identification of catalyst descriptors. In order to establish such relationships, various studies were undertaken, such as (i) effect of transition admetals on the WGS catalysis by molybdenum carbide (ii) effect of residual oxygen content {{on the performance of}} molybdenum carbide for WGS (iii) effect of cobalt as a secondary metal promoter over supported Pt catalysts. ^ In the first study, we were interested in the effects of various admetals on the WGS reaction rate and kinetic parameters measured over molybdenum carbide (MO 2 C). We focused on the determination of active sites over transition metals supported on MO 2 C. Molybdenum carbide is known to have WGS rate per gram of catalyst that is higher than the commercial Cu/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 catalyst at 120 °C. This rate is promoted further by using the MO 2 C as a support for admetals such as Pt, Pd, Au, Cu, Ni and Ag. The extent of promotion in the WGS rate normalized by the BET area of the catalyst is shown to correlate with the apparent reaction order with respect to CO. Based on a progressive decrease in the apparent CO order with increasing WGS rate per unit surface area, the CO adsorption strength over the sites created by the admetals is suggested as a potential descriptor for the rate promotion. in situ X-ray absorption experiments show that Au and Pt re-disperse on the MO 2 C support after a 600 °C carburization pretreatment, making MO 2 C an ideal candidate for the synthesis of thermally robust supported metal catalysts. The difficulties in characterization of Pt/MO 2 C by electron microscopy were overcome by using Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNT) as a 2 ̆ 7 TEM friendly 2 ̆ 7 support. Pt-Mo alloy nanoparticles in intimate contact with the MO 2 C are identified as the dominant active sites. ^ In a follow-up study, the dependence of the WGS rates on the residual oxygen content over MO 2 C and the Pt-modified bulk MO 2 C was studied with temperature programmed reduction (TPR). Platinum was shown to enhance the oxygen removal from MO 2 C after various reduction pretreatments. For a passivated (oxygen covered) MO 2 C catalyst, the WGS rate per unit surface area at 120 °C, measured after a 600 °C carburization, is 9 times higher compared to the rate measured on the same catalyst after a relatively milder reduction at 300 °C. However, for the Pt/MO 2 C catalyst, this factor of difference in the rates after the pretreatments at aforementioned temperatures was a factor of 1. 5. Thus, a Pt/MO 2 C catalyst with ∼ 6 - 7 times higher WGS rate per gram at 120 °C compared to the commercial Cu/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 catalyst is reported with a reduction pretreatment that is viable for commercial practice. ^ In the final study, we have attempted to rationalize the promotion in the WGS rate over Pt supported on MWCNT with addition of secondary metal promoter such as cobalt. X-ray absorption and XRD characterization revealed that for a bimetallic catalyst prepared with sequential impregnation of Pt and Co, isolated cobalt phases (CoOx) are formed along with Pt-Co alloy. The turnover rate for WGS at 300 °C was promoted by an order of magnitude at the Co:Pt molar ratio of 3 : 1, in comparison to the monometallic Pt. A selective leaching treatment removed the CoOx phase, without severely affecting the Pt-Co alloy (Pt-Co coordination number changed from 3 to 2. 5). The WGS TOR at 300 °C decreased 20 times after the CoOx was leached out. The formation of PtCo alloy was concluded to be inconsequential for promotion of the WGS TOR. The interface sites between CoOx and the PtCo alloy particles are suggested to be the active sites for WGS. ...|$|R

40|$|Polyvinyl {{chloride}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} produced polymers worldwide. Therefore the production of vinyl chloride monomer, PVC’s building block, <b>is</b> an <b>important</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>process.</b> The main synthesis route is via the dehydrochlorination of 1, 2 -DCE, which occurs via a radical pyrolytic process. This mature process is a highly energy demanding process in which selectivity <b>is</b> an <b>important</b> issue. Up until now, the search for catalysts for this reaction has not been successful as deactivation of porous materials is a major problem. This can be ascribed to the inefficient removal of products, which allows side reactions and eventually coke formation. In this study a new route towards vinyl chloride monomer has been developed in which the distinct properties of ionic liquids are used. Their improved basicity in comparison with traditional salts has proven to be effective in the dehydrochlorination of PVC and their liquid, but non-volatile nature can promote the removal of gaseous vinyl chloride. In chapter 1, the current industrial dehydrochlorination process is discussed together with the search for catalysts. Next to that some important characteristics of ionic liquids and their applications in catalysis are reviewed. In chapter 2, a reactor set-up is designed for this research in which easy adaptation of the reactor itself is kept in mind. Chapter 3 describes the first experimental work in which different types of ionic liquids are screened for their dehydrochlorination ability. Both cations and anions are varied in order to select the best candidate. This reveals the highest activity for tetraalkylphosphonium chlorides. Other cations are less stable or show hardly any activity, while other anions often result in the formation of side products because of anion exchange. The hydrogen bond accepting ability appears to <b>be</b> an <b>important</b> parameter in order to effect the formation of vinyl chloride. An increase in volumetric ion concentration, by dissolution of salts, generally has a negative effect on the dehydrochlorination activity as this negatively influences the hydrogen bond accepting ability of the anion. The reaction conditions and reactor set-up are further optimized in chapter 4. An increase in temperature leads to higher conversions, as expected for this reaction. The thermal stability of the ionic liquids is the limiting factor. At 240 °C very slow degradation of the ionic liquid is detected, but good conversions can be obtained, especially when the reactor design is adapted. By placing reactors in series, and eventually changing the reactor design to a liquid film reactor, conversions outperforming the industrial process can be obtained. Moreover a high selectivity is maintained, which <b>is</b> the most <b>important</b> benefit. By directly feeding liquid 1, 2 -dichloroethane to the ionic liquid, productivity can be increased to industrially relevant values. A better understanding of the mechanism is achieved in chapter 5 in which the substituents on the phosphonium cation are varied. An alkyl chain length of 3 carbons or more is desirable as shorter chains induce an activity loss. This can be attributed to the shorter cation-chloride distance and thus stronger interaction, which decreases the above-mentioned hydrogen bond accepting ability of chloride. The influence of longer alkyl chains is limited as long as the chains are not bulky. Branched alkyl chains, cyclic alkyl and aryl groups shield the phosphonium center and thus hinder the interaction with 1, 2 -dichloroethane. This suggests that both the cation and anion play a specific role in the dehydrochlorination mechanism. In chapter 6 a better insight in the kinetics of the system is obtained by feeding the different compounds that play a role in the reaction scheme, to the ionic liquid. This reveals that the high selectivity of the reaction is amongst others due to the low solubility of vinyl chloride in the ionic liquid. Both 1, 2 -dichloroethane and 1, 1 -dichloroethane dissolve fairly well in the ionic liquid and thus can be dehydrochlorinated to vinyl chloride. This compound is efficiently evacuated and will more difficultly react further to side products. The other dehydrochlorination product, HCl, dissolves much better and does have an influence on the reaction. The dissolution of HCl limits conversion as this again influences the hydrogen bond accepting ability of the chloride anion. Nevertheless a sufficient activity is maintained, which can lead to an industrially relevant application, especially when a suitable reactor is designed, based on the work in chapter 4. The insights acquired in this work can form a base for a future industrial application that can be competitive with the current industrial process. Moreover, the insights in the basic catalytic activity can give rise to other ionic liquid applications. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Model based control schemes, such as {{nonlinear}} model predictive control, {{assume that}} the full state vector of the plant is known for feedback control. However, in reality {{this is not always}} true. Most times only a set of noisy measurements are available, and thus, the unmeasured states need to be inferred from these measurements. This is done in combination with a detailed model of the system. The most common nonlinear state estimation methods do not have a means to deal with bounds or constraints on the states in an efficient or systematical way. These bounds and constraints <b>are</b> <b>important</b> in <b>chemical</b> engineering <b>processes</b> since states usually have physical meaning, for example, concentrations, molecular weights, and conversions are always positive. Therefore, state estimates must be physically feasible. Since Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) is optimization based it has become a superior strategy for constrained state estimation because bounds are handled optimally by theNonlinear Programming (NLP) solver. In the presentworkwe develop strategies for MHE based on NLP sensitivity to reduce the on-line computational expense of solving these problems. These formulations are intended to make the on-line application of MHE feasible, by reducing the potential of delays due to the computational expense of solving the associated NLP. Here we discuss two approaches to update certain tuning parameters in MHE: one of them allows us {{to reduce the size of}} the NLP that is being solved, while the other provides a fast approximation of the covariance of the initial condition. The former method is only suitable for small and medium sized problems, while the latter one is better suited for large-scale systems. Additionally, we also discuss NLP sensitivity theory and extensions that apply to the Interior Point solver we use (i. e., IPOPT). With these extensions we are able to develop fast on-line strategies for NMPC and MHE. However, in this work we focus only in the application of these developments to the latter. To reduce the horizon window we propose methods to approximate the initial condition parameters based on particle filters and sample based statistics to approximate the conditional probability density function (or its parameters) of the initial condition of the states in the MHE horizon window (i. e., the so-called arrival cost). As mentioned above, this approach is suitable mostly for only certain classes of systems that have few states or almost Gaussian behaviors. Therefore,we also develop othermethods for on-lineMHE suitable for large-scale systems that usesmoremeasurements to reduce any effects of the simplifications done to approximate the initial condition terms. Thus, using NLP sensitivity we develop strategies that leverage the parametric properties of the MHE problem to formulate fast on-line methods applicable to large-scale systems. Moreover, using NLP sensitivity also allows us to relate the optimality conditions of the associated NLP problem to the stochastic origin of MHE. For example, we show the relationship of the covariance of the state estimates with the reduced Hessian matrix of the NLP. This information can also be used to update the parameters if the initial condition penalty term. Moreover, we also discuss the use of Robust M-Estimators to reduce the effects of outliers or gross errors in the measurements. Finally, we illustrate the use and benefits of these strategies through several small and large-scale examples taken from the literature...|$|R
