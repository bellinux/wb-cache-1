5|$|Authorities of Belize City {{considered}} <b>abandoning</b> <b>the</b> {{community and}} moving it to higher ground. Additionally, {{there was a}} proposal to relocate the capital further south or inland to the pine ridge, with either resulting in a higher elevation of the capital. However, the process of moving the capital did not begin until 1961, after Belize City was devastated by Hurricane Hattie. Belmopan became {{the capital city of}} British Honduras in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Due to the Han–Xiongnu War on the north, {{the rising}} cost of {{administration}} in the distant state led to the Han <b>abandoning</b> <b>the</b> commandery. A group of Chinese explorers were captured by the Dian for four years. They were part of an expedition traveling southwards to establish an alternative trade route for the goods reported in Central Asian markets in 122 BCE.|$|E

5|$|Flann {{may have}} had the {{intention}} of <b>abandoning</b> <b>the</b> traditional succession to the kingship of Tara, whereby {{the northern and southern}} branches of the Uí Néill held the kingship alternately, but such plans were thwarted when his favoured son Óengus was killed by his son-in-law and eventual successor Niall Glúndub, son of Áed Findliath, on 7 February 915. Flann's other sons raised revolts and his authority collapsed.|$|E

5|$|The channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae) parasitizes pied currawong nests, laying eggs {{which are}} then raised by the unsuspecting foster parents. The eggs closely {{resemble}} those of the currawong hosts. Pied currawongs {{have been known to}} desert nests once cuckoos have visited, <b>abandoning</b> <b>the</b> existing currawong young, which die, and a channel-billed cuckoo has been recorded decapitating a currawong nestling. The brown goshawk (Accipiter fasciatus) and lace monitor (Varanus varius) have also been recorded taking nestlings.|$|E

During the Eighth Air Force attack more than sixty Disneys were launched, but only one hit the target, with little effect, {{although}} installations around the bunker received considerable damage.

5|$|After the Warrior left, Black Hawk {{decided to}} seek {{refuge in the}} north with the Ojibwes. Only about 50 people, {{including}} Wabokieshiek, agreed to go with him; the others remained, determined to cross the Mississippi and return to Sauk territory. The next morning, on August 2, Black Hawk was heading north {{when he learned that}} the American army had closed in on the members of the British Band who were trying to cross the Mississippi. He tried to rejoin the main body, but after a skirmish with American troops near present-day Victory, Wisconsin, he gave up the attempt. Sauk chief Weesheet later criticized Black Hawk and Wabokieshiek for <b>abandoning</b> <b>the</b> people during the final battle of the war.|$|E
5|$|By November 1987, Castro began {{spending}} {{more time on the}} Angolan Civil War, in which the Marxists had fallen into retreat. Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos successfully appealed for more Cuban troops, with Castro later admitting that he devoted more time to Angola than to the domestic situation, believing that a victory would lead to the collapse of apartheid. Gorbachev called for a negotiated end to the conflict and in 1988 organized a quadripartite talks between the USSR, U.S., Cuba and South Africa; they agreed that all foreign troops would pull out of Angola. Castro was angered by Gorbachev's approach, believing that he was <b>abandoning</b> <b>the</b> plight of the world's poor in favor of détente.|$|E

5|$|By now, the {{division}} {{was too weak}} to attempt to reach Frost at the bridge. Of the nine infantry battalions, only one (1st Battalion, The Border Regiment) still existed as a unit, the rest were badly mauled or scattered. Urquhart made the difficult decision to form a defensive perimeter around Oosterbeek, <b>abandoning</b> <b>the</b> 2nd Parachute Battalion. By securing the Driel Ferry Crossing, Urquhart hoped to hold out until XXX Corps could reach them and establish a new bridgehead over the Rhine using the ferry crossing platforms.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Musidora was exhibited, Etty's health was in serious decline. Suffering severe asthma, {{it was not}} unusual for passers-by to accuse him of {{drunkenness}} {{as he made his way}} wheezing through the London streets, and he was beginning to plan his retirement from polluted London to his beloved York. <b>Abandoning</b> <b>the</b> smaller paintings which kept him profitable, he strived to complete his Joan of Arc triptych before his health gave out. This was on a huge scale, 28ft (8.5m) in total width and 9ft 9in (3m) high; the three pictures from left to right depicted Joan devoting herself to the service of God and her country, Joan scattering the enemies of France, and Joan dying a martyr.|$|E
5|$|Bypassing Vigo on {{his flight}} southwards, Villeneuve {{put into the}} Southern Spanish fleet base of Cadiz on 20 August. By abandoning his efforts to reach the English Channel, Villeneuve was in effect <b>abandoning</b> <b>the</b> entire {{invasion}} strategy and, when news of Villeneuve's retreat reached him, Napoleon decided to formally abandon the campaign, marching the army at Boulogne south to the Austrian border. Without instructions from his superior, and with no idea where the main French fleet was, Allemand spent much of August off the Spanish coast before deciding {{to turn to the}} third aspect of his orders, the disruption of British trade.|$|E

Yuffie's loyalty to the team is called into {{question}} after Cloud temporarily disbands his party ahead of their final confrontation with Sephiroth; when Yuffie is the last to return Barret Wallace suspects her of <b>abandoning</b> <b>the</b> team in light of her earlier treachery at Wutai. When Yuffie returns to the group she subsequently rebukes Barrett for his judgement.|$|E
5|$|In 1976 Lucas wrote a paper criticizing {{large-scale}} Keynesian models {{used for}} forecasting and policy evaluation. Lucas argued that economic models based on empirical relationships between variables are unstable as policies change: a relationship under one policy regime may be invalid after the regime changes. The Lucas's critique went further {{and argued that}} a policy's impact is determined by how the policy alters the expectations of economic agents. No model is stable unless it accounts for expectations and how expectations relate to policy. New classical economists argued that <b>abandoning</b> <b>the</b> disequilibrium models of Keynesianism and focusing on structure- and behavior-based equilibrium models would remedy these faults. Keynesian economists responded by building models with microfoundations grounded in stable theoretical relationships.|$|E
5|$|In May 1905, {{after two}} years of negotiations, American-Hawaiian signed a {{contract}} with the Tehuantepec National Railway of Mexico, <b>abandoning</b> <b>the</b> Straits of Magellan route in favor of the Tehuantepec Route. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route would arrive at Mexican ports—Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, for eastbound cargo, and Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, for westbound cargo—and would traverse the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico's narrowest point, on the railroad. Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature.|$|E
