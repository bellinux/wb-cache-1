5|$|Anderson and Ward {{exploit the}} new {{information}} to concoct a plan, luring identified KKK collaborators to <b>a</b> <b>bogus</b> meeting. The Klan members soon realize it is a set-up and leave without discussing the murders. The FBI then concentrate on Lester Cowens, a Klansman of interest, who exhibits a nervous demeanor which the agents believe might yield a confession. The FBI pick him up and interrogate him. Later, Cowens is at home when his window is shattered by a shotgun blast. After seeing a burning cross on his lawn, Cowens tries to flee in his truck, but is caught by several hooded men who intend to hang him. The FBI arrive to rescue him, having staged the whole scenario; the hooded men are revealed to be other agents.|$|E
5|$|After leaving politics, Hastings {{returned}} to {{his work as a}} barrister, and eventually surpassed even his previous reputation and success as an advocate. His first major case after returning was representing F. A. Mitchell-Hedges, a noted professional explorer, in his libel action against London Express Newspapers, the owner of the Daily Express. The Daily Express had published two articles saying that he was a liar, and had planned out <b>a</b> <b>bogus</b> robbery to advertise a device known as the Monomark. The case opened on 9 February 1928 in front of Lord Hewart, with Hastings and Norman Birkett representing Mitchell-Hedges and William Jowitt and J.B. Melville representing London Express Newspapers. Despite the skills of both Hastings and Birkett, who later became a much-lauded barrister in his own right, Mitchell-Hedges lost his case and had his reputation destroyed as a result.|$|E

In 2002, Jackson was challenged in the Democratic primary by three candidates. Jackson claimed that state Sen. William Shaw and his brother, Cook County Board of Review Commissioner Robert Shaw, had planted <b>a</b> <b>bogus</b> candidate in the primary race. The claim was that they selected 68-year-old retired Robbins truck driver, Jesse L. Jackson, as an opponent in order to confuse voters and derail the congressman's re-election campaign. Jackson asked a Cook County court to question the Shaws and others under oath, but his effort was rejected and no criminal wrongdoing was found. As Jackson prepared to take further legal action, Jesse L. Jackson withdrew his candidacy after the unexpected deaths of his wife and grandson.|$|E

Consequently, a power {{struggle}} breaks out between Sam – who wants her pub back in return for her silence – and Chrissie, with each woman trying to gain control of Zoe. In the meantime, Chrissie publicly accounts for Den's sudden absence by declaring that he has run off with another woman and attempts to make her story convincing by throwing his clothes into the street and engaging in <b>a</b> <b>bogus</b> phone conversation with him in front of a packed pub. She successfully removes Zoe from the Square for a time, and begins a relationship with Jake Moon (Joel Beckett); however, Sam has taken the doorstop and hidden it in her flat. She then proceeds to blackmail Chrissie by saying that unless the pub is given back to her, she will inform the police. Chrissie stalls for time, and eventually calls Sam's bluff, declaring that she will take Sam down with her if she goes to the police. Desperate, Sam tries to corner Chrissie by telling Zoe the truth. Zoe confronts Chrissie before fleeing to Spain, telling her mother Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) what has happened before she goes.|$|E
5|$|Greater {{problems}} arose over financial {{speculation and}} {{the management of the}} national debt. Certain government bonds could not be redeemed without the consent of the bondholder and had been issued when interest rates were high; consequently each bond represented a long-term drain on public finances, as bonds were hardly ever redeemed. In 1719 the South Sea Company proposed to take over £31million (three fifths) of the British national debt by exchanging government securities for stock in the company. The Company bribed Lord Sunderland, George's mistress Melusine von der Schulenburg, and Lord Stanhope's cousin, Charles Stanhope, who was Secretary of the Treasury, to support their plan. The Company enticed bondholders to convert their high-interest, irredeemable bonds to low-interest, easily tradeable stocks by offering apparently preferential financial gains. Company prices rose rapidly; the shares had cost £128 on 1 January 1720, but were valued at £500 when the conversion scheme opened in May. On 24 June the price reached a peak of £1,050. The company's success led to the speculative flotation of other companies, some of <b>a</b> <b>bogus</b> nature, and the Government, in an attempt to suppress these schemes and {{with the support of the}} Company, passed the Bubble Act. With the rise in the market now halted, uncontrolled selling began in August, which caused the stock to plummet to £150 by the end of September. Many individuals—including aristocrats—lost vast sums and some were completely ruined. George, who had been in Hanover since June, returned to London in November—sooner than he wanted or was usual—at the request of the ministry.|$|E

However, Sindona also had put the Mafia's heroin money at risk, due to his financial malpractice. The real purpose of the kidnapping was to issue sparsely disguised blackmail notes to Sindona's past political allies – among them Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti – to engineer the rescue of his banks and recuperate Cosa Nostra's money. The Gambinos accompanied Sindona's attempt to recover the money, but the plans failed and Sindona was arrested, leading to the indictment of the Inzerillo-Spatola-Gambino network. It remains unclear if any of the Mafia money Sindona had lost was recovered. Rosario met Sindona and John Gambino upon his return at JFK Airport.|$|E
25|$|Jackson {{was also}} alleged by Kevin Dowling, Joe Tiernan, and the Pat Finucane Centre to {{have led the}} UVF gang that carried out the Miami Showband {{massacre}} at Buskhill, outside Newry on 31 July 1975, which left band members Brian McCoy, Fran O'Toole and Tony Geraghty dead. Two others, Stephen Travers and Des McAlea, were wounded. Harris Boyle and Wesley Somerville, both suspects in the Dublin bombings, and members of both the UDR and Mid-Ulster UVF, were accidentally blown up after they had loaded a bomb {{into the back of}} the band's minibus which had been parked in a lay-by. The minibus, driven by trumpeter Brian McCoy (a Protestant from Caledon, County Tyrone), had been flagged-down by UVF men wearing British Army uniforms at <b>a</b> <b>bogus</b> roadside military checkpoint on the main A1 road as the band was returning home to Dublin after a performance in Banbridge.

25|$|On 31 July 1975, {{four days}} after Hanna's {{shooting}} and Jackson's assumption of leadership of the Mid-Ulster brigade, the Miami Showband's minibus was flagged-down outside Newry by armed UVF men wearing British Army uniforms at <b>a</b> <b>bogus</b> military checkpoint. Two UVF men (Harris Boyle and Wesley Somerville) loaded a time delay bomb on the minibus but it exploded prematurely and killed them. The remaining UVF gunmen then opened fire on the bandmembers, killing three (Brian McCoy, Anthony Geraghty and Fran O'Toole) and wounding two (Stephen Travers and Des McAlea). Two of the three men convicted of the killings and sentenced to life imprisonment were serving members of the UDR, and the third was a former member. The Luger pistol used in the attack {{was found to have}} been the same one used to kill Provisional IRA member John Francis Green in January 1975 and was also used in the O'Dowd killings of January 1976. The following May, the security forces found Jackson's fingerprints on a home-made silencer attached to a Luger. Although charged, Jackson avoided conviction. A Sterling 9mm submachine gun was also used in the Miami Showband killings. The 2003 Barron Report suggests that the guns were taken from the stockpile of weapons at the Glenanne farm. The Luger pistol used in the Green, Miami Showband, and O'Dowd attacks was later destroyed by the RUC on 28 August 1978.|$|E

25|$|The UVF's {{declared}} {{goals were}} to combat Irish republicanism – particularly the Irish Republican Army (IRA) – {{and to maintain}} Northern Ireland's status {{as part of the}} United Kingdom. It was responsible for more than 500 deaths. The vast majority (more than two-thirds) of its victims were Irish Catholic civilians, who were often killed at random. During the conflict, its deadliest attack in Northern Ireland was the 1971 McGurk's Bar bombing, which killed fifteen civilians. The group also carried out attacks in the Republic of Ireland from 1969 onward. The biggest of these was the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings, which killed 34 civilians, making it the deadliest terrorist attack of the conflict. The no-warning car bombings had been carried out by units from the Belfast and Mid-Ulster brigades. The Mid-Ulster Brigade was also responsible for the 1975 Miami Showband killings, in which three members of the popular Irish cabaret band were shot dead at <b>a</b> <b>bogus</b> military checkpoint by gunmen in British Army uniforms. Two UVF men were accidentally blown up in this poorly planned attack. The UVF's last major attack was the 1994 Loughinisland massacre, in which its members shot dead six Catholic civilians in a rural pub. Until recent years, it was noted for secrecy and a policy of limited, selective membership.

40|$|Abstract — Attacks against {{broadcast}} {{services in}} {{wireless sensor networks}} will have the most catastrophic effects on power and other resource consumptions. <b>As</b> <b>bogus</b> broadcast packets are propagated through sensor nodes without being filtered out, sensor nodes will waste their resources such as power and memory on transmitting and buffering those false packets. In networks where complex Denial-of- Service (DoS) attacks may be launched, each node {{should be able to}} limit its effects on resource consumptions. In addition, it is strongly desired to identify compromised sensor node(s) which has injected invalid packets (intrusion detection) and to isolate the nodes (remediation) such that no more DoS attack is possible through the compromised sensor node(s) in the future. A new secure broadcast authentication scheme for sensor networks is proposed in this paper based upon predictive-hasing and µTESLA techniques. This new scheme may be used to detect invalid packets as quickly as possible and to isolate links that are from the compromised nodes, which results in enhanced resistance to various security attacks including DoS attacks. We present the details of the scheme along with the simulation results. Index Terms — authentication, wireless sensor network, broadcast, intrusion detection, remediatio...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA three-dimensional, primitive equation model by Anthes and Warner (1978) {{was used to}} predict five typhoon cases. The five-layer model on a 40 X 40 staggered grid with 120 km resolution included a moisture cycle, sensible and latent heat flux at the earth's surface, and a bulk pararneterization of the planetary boundary layer. The model is initialized using operational wind fields and two forms of <b>a</b> wind <b>bogus.</b> Due {{to the lack of}} a representative moisture analysis in the vicinity of tropical cyclones, simulated moisture fields were used to initialize the model. Initial experiments conducted with these fields produced widespread convection and heating which developed circulations in areas well removed from the actual storm. The associated modifications to the steering flow, and the overly intense storm circulations resulted in premature recurvature. Use of <b>a</b> second moisture <b>bogus,</b> which provided less available moisture (especially at upper levels), reduced the amount of convection over the entire grid and the effect on the steering current. <b>A</b> second wind <b>bogus</b> based on <b>a</b> scheme described by Hovermale (1976) was also tested. This technique resulted in a smaller and less intense initial storm, which also resulted in considerably less convection. The tracks forecast by the different wind and moisture fields were compared with forecasts of the 60 km resolution Madala and Hodur model using the same initial data. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R
