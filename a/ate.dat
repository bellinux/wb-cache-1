40|$|Picky <b>eating</b> is a {{childhood}} behavior that vexes many parents {{and is a}} symptom in the newer diagnosis of Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) in adults. Pressure to <b>eat,</b> a parental controlling feeding practice aimed at encouraging a child to <b>eat</b> more, is associated with picky <b>eating</b> {{and a number of}} other childhood <b>eating</b> concerns. Low intuitive <b>eating,</b> an insensitivity to internal hunger and satiety cues, is also associated with a number of problem <b>eating</b> behaviors in adulthood. Whether picky <b>eating</b> and pressure to <b>eat</b> are predictive of young adult <b>eating</b> behavior is relatively unstudied. Current adult intuitive <b>eating</b> and disordered <b>eating</b> behaviors were self-reported by 170 college students, along with childhood picky <b>eating</b> and pressure through retrospective self- and parent reports. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that childhood parental pressure to <b>eat,</b> but not picky <b>eating,</b> predicted intuitive <b>eating</b> and disordered <b>eating</b> symptoms in college students. These findings suggest that parental pressure in childhood is associated with problematic <b>eating</b> patterns in young adulthood. Additional research is needed to understand the extent to which parental pressure is a reaction to or perhaps compounds the development of problematic <b>eating</b> behavior...|$|R

5|$|A {{motif of}} father-against-son {{conflict}} was repeated when Cronus {{was confronted by}} his son, Zeus. Because Cronus had betrayed his father, he feared that his offspring would do the same, and so each time Rhea gave birth, he snatched up the child and <b>ate</b> it. Rhea hated this and tricked him by hiding Zeus and wrapping a stone in a baby's blanket, which Cronus <b>ate.</b> When Zeus was full grown, he fed Cronus a drugged drink which caused him to vomit, throwing up Rhea's other children and the stone, which {{had been sitting in}} Cronus's stomach all along.

The fact that it survived long after Rodrigues had been heavily deforested shows that its ecology was less vulnerable than that of, for example, the Rodrigues parrot.|$|E
40|$|The {{immediate}} effect of maternal {{control of their}} daughter's <b>eating</b> is well documented. However, the longterm effect of both maternal and paternal control of <b>eating</b> during childhood on adults' current <b>eating</b> attitudes and behaviors has been a relatively unexplored area. Parents {{play a central role}} in shaping the family <b>eating</b> environment, which provides a context for the child's relationship with food for years to come (Birch, Fisher, Grimm-Thomas, Markey, Sawyer & Johnson, 2001). The present study focused on expanding the existing knowledge base concerning parental control over <b>eating.</b> Two hundred sixty-seven female adult participants completed a questionnaire packet designed to measure maternal and paternal restriction and pressure to <b>eat</b> during childhood, family mealtime stress during childhood, current restriction, binge <b>eating,</b> emotional <b>eating,</b> <b>eating</b> from external cues, and current affect during meals. Results indicated that parental pressure to <b>eat</b> during childhood are related to restricted <b>eating,</b> emotional <b>eating,</b> and <b>eating</b> from external cues during adulthood. Family mealtime stress during childhood was related to binge <b>eating,</b> restricted <b>eating,</b> emotional <b>eating,</b> <b>eating</b> from external cues, and negative affect while <b>eating</b> during adulthood. Implications for practice and recommendations for future research are presented...|$|R
30|$|After the intervention, {{intuitive}} <b>eating</b> and mindful <b>eating</b> {{scores were}} significantly higher than before the intervention, while emotional <b>eating</b> and binge <b>eating</b> scores were lower.

30|$|Mindfulness is {{also related}} {{to the concept of}} {{intuitive}} <b>eating,</b> which describes the tendency of an individual to be observant of his or her body signals and emotions and to <b>eat</b> according to physical hunger and satiety cues rather than emotions and rigid rules about the “right” and “wrong” types of food. Intuitive <b>eating</b> encourages the pleasure derived from <b>eating,</b> along with a healthy relationship with food, mind, and body, instead of engaging in reactive maladaptive <b>eating</b> behaviors. Therefore, intuitive <b>eating</b> encompasses the mindfulness components of acceptance and awareness (Tribole and Resch, 2012). A study by Duarte et al. (2016) found that intuitive <b>eating</b> significantly moderated the relationship between negative affect and binge <b>eating,</b> suggesting that increased levels of intuitive <b>eating</b> may buffer the effects of depressive symptoms on binge <b>eating.</b> Mindful <b>eating</b> and intuitive <b>eating</b> {{have been found to be}} inversely associated with binge and emotional <b>eating</b> (Katterman, Kleinman, Hood, Nackers, and Corsica, 2014). As those concepts of mindful and intuitive <b>eating</b> represent adaptive <b>eating</b> behaviors, related especially with present moment awareness, these variables are naturally inversely associated with <b>eating</b> triggered by emotions or lacking awareness, like in binge or emotional <b>eating.</b> However, the effect of an DBT skills training-based intervention and time still need to be examined in intuitive <b>eating</b> and mindful <b>eating.</b> Moreover, if DBT skills training leads to the path of mindful <b>eating</b> (Wisniewski, Safer, and Chen, 2007) the mediational role of mindful <b>eating</b> needs to be investigated.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine, in a general population, the {{resemblance}} in <b>eating</b> behaviour between adolescents and their parents. This study was based on the first examination of a community-based epidemiological study in Northern France. Subjects were offspring aged 14 - 22 years (135 boys and 125 girls) and their parents (174 fathers and 205 mothers). The Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire Revised 18 -item version (TFEQ-R 18) identified three aspects of <b>eating</b> behaviour: cognitive restraint of <b>eating,</b> uncontrolled <b>eating</b> and emotional <b>eating.</b> Familial resemblance in <b>eating</b> behaviour was measured by partial Spearman's correlations, adjusted for age and body mass index. Sons' uncontrolled <b>eating</b> was positively related to fathers' cognitive restraint of <b>eating</b> (r = 0. 36), but not to fathers' uncontrolled <b>eating</b> (r = 0. 07), nor to mothers' <b>eating</b> behaviour. Sons' cognitive restraint of <b>eating</b> was related to no parental <b>eating</b> behaviour scores. In daughters, cognitive restraint of <b>eating</b> was positively related to mothers' uncontrolled <b>eating</b> (r = 0. 26), but not to mothers' cognitive restraint of <b>eating</b> (r = 0. 13). Daughters' uncontrolled <b>eating</b> and emotional <b>eating</b> were positively associated with the same scores in mothers. Finally, daughters' <b>eating</b> behaviour was not related to fathers' <b>eating</b> behaviour. In conclusion, correlations in <b>eating</b> behaviour were higher with the parent of the same gender, and <b>eating</b> behaviours in adolescents seem to reflect opposition to parents' behaviour more than familial resemblance...|$|R
40|$|On a new {{framework}} for anorexia nervosa, learning to <b>eat</b> is central intervention; as patients regain a normal pattern of <b>eating</b> their problems dissolve. Mandometer®, a development of previous methods, allows simultaneous recording of <b>eating</b> {{rate and the}} development of satiety as well as experimental manipulation of <b>eating</b> rate. By measuring <b>eating</b> behavior {{during the course of a}} meal with this method, women were divided into those <b>eating</b> at a decelerated rate and those <b>eating</b> at a constant rate. Decelerated eaters are able to resists experimental challenges such as <b>eating</b> at an increased or decreased rate, but linear eaters <b>eat</b> more or less food in these experimental conditions. Satiety develops similarly in both decelerated and lineal eaters. Linear eaters develop a pattern of <b>eating</b> similar to that of anorexic patients when <b>eating</b> at a decreased rate, they <b>eat</b> less food yet experience an increase in satiety. Linear eaters can learn to <b>eat</b> at a decelerated rate and if they do they can resist overeating when tested to <b>eat</b> at a high rate. As a result of the learning, they also score lower on restrained <b>eating,</b> a cognitive construct thought of as a cause of <b>eating</b> behavior. Skipping dinner increases the linearity of <b>eating</b> and reduces food intake in women but has the opposite effect in men; these changes in <b>eating</b> behavior can be reversed by feedback on how to <b>eat</b> during the meal. The conditions of the school dinner in secondary schools are such that the speed of <b>eating</b> increases by 50 % and food intake gets distorted from its normal pattern. The change can be reversed by <b>eating</b> in a relaxed condition or by feedback on how to <b>eat</b> during the meal. It is suggested that linear <b>eating</b> is a risk factor for <b>eating</b> disorders and that the risk can be reduced by practicing <b>eating</b> using feedback on how to <b>eat</b> properly...|$|R
