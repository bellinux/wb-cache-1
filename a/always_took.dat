Despite his subsequent joint career in broadcasting and business, his commercial activities <b>always</b> <b>took</b> precedence. He declared that his work on radio was only a hobby, and that he would give it up before his business career. He combined his two roles by working full-time, and writing scripts with Murdoch at weekends.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also worth}} noticing {{that in the}} early 16th century one of the houses which predated the palace hosted an osteria. In the late 1510s Raphael, at that time {{painting}} the Vatican loggias, often had lunch together with his aides in a rear room of that eatery. The artists often discussed work problems during lunch, sketching different solutions {{on the walls of the}} room. When the palace was built, the osteria remained in place, and the owners <b>always</b> <b>took</b> care of the walls of that room throughout the years.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the year, the first Senate meeting <b>always</b> <b>took</b> place at the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. Other venues could include the Temple of Fides or the Temple of Concord, or, if the meeting was outside of the formal boundary of the city, at the Temple of Apollo or (if a war meeting) at the Temple of Bellona. In addition, the Senate operated while under various religious restrictions. For example, before any meeting could begin, a sacrifice to the gods was made, and a search for divine omens (the auspices) was taken. The auspices were taken in order to determine whether that particular Senate meeting held favor with the gods. The Senate was only allowed to meet in a building of religious significance, such as the Curia Hostilia.|$|E

5|$|Merian Caldwell Cooper (October 24, 1893 – April 21, 1973) was an American aviator, United States Air Force and Polish Air Force officer, adventurer, screenwriter, film director, and producer. Cooper was {{the founder}} of the Kościuszko Squadron during the Polish–Soviet War and was a Soviet {{prisoner}} of war for a time. He was a notable movie producer, and got his start with film as part of the Explorers Club, traveling the world and documenting adventures. He {{was a member of the}} board of directors of Pan American Airways, but his love of film <b>always</b> <b>took</b> priority. During his film career, he worked for companies such as Pioneer Pictures, RKO Pictures, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He is also credited as co-inventor of the Cinerama film projection process. Cooper's most famous film was the 1933 movie King Kong. He was awarded an honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement in 1952 and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.|$|E
5|$|The sequel series' {{second season}} reveals that Avatar Aang {{apparently}} treated Tenzin as his favorite child, {{due to his}} son's Airbender status; Kya and Bumi mentioned to Tenzin that Aang <b>always</b> <b>took</b> Tenzin on vacations with him, but never them. Aang's Air Acolytes also were unaware that Aang had two other children besides Tenzin. Aang himself later appears, along with Roku, Kyoshi and Kuruk, before Korra in a vision and encourages her to learn the origins of Wan (the first Avatar) and Raava. Aang, or possibly a vision of him, later appears in the Spirit World, encouraging Tenzin to move past the enormous legacy of being Aang's son and find his own path. Korra's connection to Aang and the other preceding Avatars is severed when Vaatu extracts and subsequently kills Raava, the divine Avatar Spirit entity within her. Even though Raava is reborn and fused again with Korra, she discovers, to her dismay, that her spiritual connection to Aang and all past Avatars is gone forever.|$|E

25|$|Though Deakin <b>always</b> <b>took</b> {{pains to}} obscure the spiritual {{dimensions}} of his character from public gaze, he felt {{a strong sense of}} providence and destiny working in his career. Like Dag Hammarskjöld much later, Deakin's sincere longing for spiritual fulfillment led him to express a sense of unworthiness in his private diaries, which mingled with his literary aspirations as a poet.|$|E

He had been planning a trip to Norway for some time, but made sure he would visit Sweden and Denmark, emphasizing his Scandinavian-American background.|$|E
25|$|At Milan on March 1, 293, Constantius was {{formally}} appointed as Maximian’s Caesar. He adopted the names Flavius Valerius {{and was given}} command of Gaul, Britannia and possibly Hispania. Diocletian, the eastern Augustus, {{in order to keep}} the balance of power in the imperium elevated Galerius as his Caesar, possibly on May 21, 293 at Philippopolis. Constantius was the more senior of the two Caesars, and on official documents he <b>always</b> <b>took</b> precedence, being mentioned before Galerius. Constantius’ capital was to be located at Augusta Treverorum.|$|E
25|$|Leonid Grinin {{argues that}} {{whatever}} plants were cultivated, the independent invention of agriculture <b>always</b> <b>took</b> place in special natural environments (e.g., South-East Asia). It is supposed that {{the cultivation of}} cereals started somewhere in the Near East: {{in the hills of}} Palestine or Egypt. So Grinin dates the beginning of the agricultural revolution within the interval 12,000 to 9,000 BP, though in some cases the first cultivated plants or domesticated animals' bones are even of a more ancient age of 14–15 thousand years ago.|$|E

Once close, the crew secured the rope launched by the keepers. The rope was used to ferry a passenger back and forth. Once the passenger had secured his safety belt, he sat down with his luggage astride a kind of large ball that slid up or down the rope. In stormy weather the manoeuvre was particularly delicate and difficult; in fierce gales it was often impossible.|$|E
25|$|Even in {{his later}} years, Scheinberg {{continued}} to fly abroad to fund-raise for his yeshiva. He <b>always</b> <b>took</b> the Talmudic tractate of Niddah with him and tried to learn all 72 folio-pages during the flight. He was known for never wasting a minute, using the time he spent walking or driving to yeshiva immersed in Torah study. According to his driver, Asa Wittow, he always sat with a Torah book in front of him, even at a wedding, and propped a Mishnah Berurah on the shelf above his kitchen sink while he washed dishes.|$|E
25|$|Ling Tong {{respected}} and befriended {{members of the}} scholar-gentry. They admired him {{even though he was}} a military serviceman. Being receptive, he had a reputation for being accommodating towards men of talent. Even when he was busy with work, he <b>always</b> <b>took</b> time to receive visitors. He viewed righteousness and loyalty as important values and saw wealth as inferior. He was thus praised by Chen Shou as a guoshi. Once, Sun Quan's subjects recommended a famous talent, Sheng Xian, to him. Ling Tong was asleep when he heard that Sheng Xian had arrived to meet his lord. He immediately got out of bed to receive Sheng Xian and held Sheng's hand while leading him to meet Sun Quan.|$|E

25|$|During {{the summer}} of 1904, the band of the Corps of the Royal Engineers {{performed}} in the bandstand. From 1904 to the 1950s, during the summer season there was a different repertory theatre show, concert party or Pierrot show every week. A regular repertory company was Harry Hanson's Court Players. Throughout the year there were regular dances to bands led by, for example, Ted Heath, Syd Lawrence and Eric Delaney. The Wylie Price orchestra, the regular tea dance band at the Central Bandstand, usually performed at the town's new year party in the Hall. The yearly selection dance for Miss Herne Bay, the carnival queen, <b>always</b> <b>took</b> place here, and as of 2005 was continuing to do so. In 1927 Herne Bay hosted eleven different bands including the Buffs. Guest bands performed at The King's Hall bandstand in the morning, then at the Central Bandstand in the afternoon or evening. At {{the end of the}} day, the East Kent Bus Company provided a fleet of double-decker buses to transport the audience home to Whitstable and Canterbury.|$|E
25|$|The Gujarat {{government}} had faced strong criticism by {{human rights groups}} for anti-Muslim human rights violations, following the communal riots of 2002. During this period, there had been several police encounter deaths in the Gujarat, three {{of which have been}} attributed to attempts to kill Narendra Modi in retaliation for the alleged involvement of the state machinery in the riots. Some human rights activists have alleged that many of these alleged encounters actually happen in police custody. They claimed that there is a pattern that many of these encounters followed: they <b>always</b> <b>took</b> place {{in the wee hours of}} the morning in a deserted area, with no witnesses; a vigorous exchange of fire resulted in the deaths of all the terrorists, while the police received no injuries; and the diary of the accused was often recovered, and contained incriminating evidence. In 2007, several of the policemen held responsible for the death of Ishrat faced trial in connection with the 2005 fake encounter of Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife. The police officer D.G. Vanzara, who led the encounter was later jailed for his involvement in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter. This resulted in an investigation into the encounter involving Ishrat.|$|E
25|$|They {{sailed to}} South Africa, {{stopping}} {{on their way}} at the remote Atlantic island of St Helena, in May 1957. Dolf had to make breakneck manoeuvres to reach the shore with a ‘klepdoos’ (a sweeping separator), thought by fellow-travellers to be a Geiger counter. In South Africa, Dolf had accepted {{a job at the}} Ministry of Agriculture in Pretoria. There he was charged with the study of insects and the problems they caused in warehouses. After three years he accepted the position of Marine Biologist and Curator at the newly erected Oceanarium in Port Elizabeth. Since it was the first institute of its kind in Africa, there were many start-up problems. When, shortly afterwards, the Natal Museum in Pietermaritzburg offered him a position as curator of malacology, it was an offer he could not refuse. Both he and Wenda worked at the museum from 1962 to 1966; she as a librarian and his personal assistant in the field. They frequently went out for fieldwork, taking the opportunity whenever the museum’s Land Rover was available to make collection trips as far north as Malawi and Zambia. Dolf <b>always</b> <b>took</b> notes in his fieldbooks, which became more elaborate over the years. His Africana Biologica now contains 1550 pages, in eight parts.|$|E
