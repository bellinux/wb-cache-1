5|$|In November 2015, Varian {{announced}} {{that she would be}} working with the California Rangeland Trust to place her ranch into a conservation easement to protect it from development. She had begun the project with the intent that her longtime ranch manager, Angela Alvarez, would operate the horse breeding program after Varian was no longer able to do so, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>once</b> Alvarez was no longer able to run the ranch, the property would be gifted to the Trust to be sold, the conservation easement running with the land, and attempts made to find a buyer that would also be interested in maintaining the Arabian horse breeding program.|$|E
5|$|For {{three hundred}} years, Belton House was {{the seat of}} the Brownlow and Cust family, who had first {{acquired}} land in the area in the late 16th century. Between 1685 and 1688 Sir John Brownlow and his wife had the present mansion built. Despite great wealth they chose to build a modest country house rather than a grand contemporary Baroque palace. The contemporary, if provincial, Carolean style was the selected choice of design. However, the new house was fitted with the latest innovations such as sash windows for the principal rooms, and more importantly completely separate areas for the staff. As the Brownlows rose from baronets to barons upward to earls <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>once</b> again became barons, successive generations made changes to the interior of the house which reflected their changing social position and tastes, yet the fabric and design of the house changed little.|$|E
5|$|Nevada and Maryland then {{exchanged}} punts three times, and the Wolf Pack punted it away {{a fourth}} time. In {{the span of}} two series, Kaepernick was sacked three times, once each by linebackers Dave Philistin, Alex Wujciak, and Adrian Moten. As a result, Kaepernick suffered an ankle sprain and played {{the rest of the}} game, but he noticeably favored his uninjured side. The Terps took over on their 47-yard line with 0:29 remaining in the half. Turner completed an eight-yard pass to Ronnie Tyler, and a Nevada hit out-of-bounds resulted in a 15-yard penalty against Nevada and a first down for Maryland. After two incomplete passes, Turner then converted on third down again with a toss to Tyler for 16yards <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>once</b> more for 14yards and a touchdown to bring the score to 26–14 in Maryland's favor. The Terps elected to attempt a two-point conversion, and Turner completed a pass to a wide-open Meggett in {{the right side of the}} end zone. With six seconds remaining in the first half, Maryland had a 28–14 lead. Nevada received Maryland's kickoff, but elected to run out the clock and head into halftime.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Peter McConnell, Michael Land and Clint Bajakian. The three had {{worked together to}} share the duties equally of composing the music for Monkey Island 2 and Fate of Atlantis, and continued this approach for Day of the Tentacle. According to McConnell, he had composed most of the music {{taking place in the}} game's present, Land for the future, and Bajakian for the past, outside of Dr. Fred's theme for the past which McConnell had done. The music was composed around the cartoonist nature of the game play, further drawing on Looney Tunes' use of parodying classical works of music, and playing on set themes for all of the major characters in the game. Many of these themes had to be composed to take into account different processing speeds of computers at the time, managed by the iMUSE music interface; such themes would include shorter repeating patterns that would play while the game's screen scrolled across, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>once</b> the screen was at the proper place, the music would continue on to a more dramatic phrase.|$|E
5|$|Between August 1943 and February 1945, the 13th Airborne Division {{remained}} in the United States and did not serve overseas or participate in any airborne operations, as it began training to become a combat-ready formation. In comparison, the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions had been assigned as active combat formations to serve overseas in Europe, the 11th Airborne Division {{was scheduled to be}} deployed to the Pacific Theater of Operations, and the 17th Airborne Division had been assigned as the United States strategic reserve formation. During this period, the activities of the division primarily involved airborne training, as well as taking part in several training exercises. However, while airborne training for the first four American airborne divisions was conducted during 1943, the 13th encountered considerable difficulties when it came to its turn for training. By the last few months of 1943 the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions had conducted airborne exercises and finished their training, and had then been transferred to Europe; to ensure the divisions could conduct airborne operations, a majority of the transport aircraft available in the United States had been sent with them, and even more were transferred to Europe as replacements after the American airborne landings in Normandy in June 1944. Consequently, very few transport aircraft were available for use by the 13th, and the original training exercise for the division that had been scheduled for June 1944 had to be postponed until 17 September, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>once</b> again until 24 September.|$|E
5|$|The 2008–09 season {{would be}} almost as {{successful}} for Martin. He once again qualified for the Brier, winning the Alberta provincial championship, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>once</b> again went 13–0 in the 2009 Tim Hortons Brier. He knocked off Glenn Howard 7–6 followed by Jeff Stoughton in the final by a 7–4 result. A week later, at the 2009 Canada Cup of Curling, Martin won his third title, defeating fellow Edmonton rink Randy Ferbey in the final. At the 2009 Ford World Men's Curling Championship, Martin won 10 straight games until he met Scotland {{in the final round}} robin game. Martin lost to Scotland and then lost to them again in the 1–2 page playoff game. Martin rebounded with a tight semifinal victory over Switzerland, but had to face Scotland in a third matchup in the final. The game was tied going into the last end with Martin having the last rock advantage. Before his first rock, Martin was lying one in a complicated setup. After spending about six minutes trying to decide which shot to try, he went against the wishes of his teammates and threw away his shot, forcing Scotland's David Murdoch to make a double-tap to sit shot. Murdoch made his shot, leaving Martin with a short-raise double, which he missed, losing the championship to Scotland, 7–6.|$|E

25|$|History: The OAA {{was started}} in 1929 by the first Principal of the then Prince of Wales College, Rev. Alec G.

Sandy spent his {{vacations}} touring towns and villages where Old Achimotans were working to explain the {{aims and objectives of}} the OAA. The OAA’s first Annual General Meeting was held at the school on 23 December 1930, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>once</b> a year thereafter.

25|$|The {{infantry}} {{was raised}} from three New Model Army regiments in Scotland {{that were still}} not disbanded.

Most were parliamentarians but also included many Catholic Royalist Irish and Scottish soldiers. They were formed, trained and commanded by Thomas Morgan a Welsh veteran soldier from the Dutch Revolt and the Civil War. Once formed the brigade consisted of two infantry regiments, each of 1,000 men, and a cavalry regiment, just under 1,000 men totalling for the brigade around 3,000 men.|$|E

In 1907 compulsory military service was introduced. Former head of Germany's mission, Colonel Hans Kundt became the head of the General staff and later Minister of War. Kundt became involved with the Republican Party and provided it with army's loyalty during the 1920 coup after which he purged many Liberal officers. He was later recalled to Bolivia in 1932 to lead army during the Chaco War.|$|E
25|$|Lütjens' tactics proved {{useful in}} two respects. After the Hood battle, he steamed {{directly}} at his pursuers, forcing them away, while his heavy cruiser escaped out of radar range. On 25 May, his 52nd birthday, despite constant action and exhaustion, {{he ordered a}} clever manoeuvre. He ordered full speed and then a three-quarter clockwise turn once his pursuers had reached the extremis of their radar range. The British cruisers had been performing zigzags to avoid German U-boats they {{believed to be in}} the vicinity. At the outer edge of their port turn, they would be at the limit of their radar's range. This allowed him to escape the enemy radar, steam in the opposite direction, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>once</b> behind them steam across their wake and avoid enemy attempts to regain contact.|$|E
