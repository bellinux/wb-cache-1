25|$|Reinforcement is the {{synergistic}} {{improvement of}} a total system’s strength created {{by the introduction of}} a geotextile, geogrid or geocell (all of which are good in tension) into a soil (that is good in compression, but poor in tension) or other disjointed and separated material. Applications of this function are in mechanically stabilized and retained earth walls and steep soil slopes; they can be combined with masonry facings to create vertical retaining walls. Also involved is the application of basal reinforcement over soft soils and over deep foundations for embankments and heavy surface loadings. Stiff polymer geogrids and geocells {{do not have to be}} held in tension to provide soil reinforcement, unlike geotextiles. Stiff 2D geogrid and 3D geocells interlock with the <b>aggregate</b> <b>particles</b> and the reinforcement mechanism is one of confinement of the aggregate. The resulting mechanically stabilized aggregate layer exhibits improved loadbearing performance.|$|E

In general, ballast aggregates are considered as uniformly graded, angular shaped with crushed faces. However, various ballast <b>aggregate</b> gradations and <b>particle</b> shapes are in use yet their effects on ballast performances remain unknown.

The effects of the foaming process on bitumen chemistry were investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques. Also, foam characteristics of three binders were established and a rational method to optimize foam characteristics proposed. <b>Aggregate</b> <b>particle</b> coating with foamed bitumen was studied using the concepts of surface energy and Rice density. In addition a gyratory laboratory compaction procedure for laterite gravels treated with foamed bitumen was established using the modified locking concept. Infrared techniques have shown that foaming does not cause any changes in the binder chemistry, suggesting that foaming may be a physical process. Further, foam characteristics are greatly influenced by binder viscosity. Also, the equiviscous temperature seems to produce foam with optimum foam characteristics. Rice density results showed that aggregate size fraction, binder expansion ratio and viscosity influenced <b>aggregate</b> <b>particle</b> coating. Surface energy results revealed that foamed bitumen exhibited better coating attributes than neat bitumen.
