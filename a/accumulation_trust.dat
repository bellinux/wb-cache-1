50|$|There are {{a number}} of reasons why the {{beneficiaries}} may elect to do this. In Saunders v Vautier, the <b>accumulation</b> <b>trusts</b> were to continue until the beneficiary was 25, and (at 21) the beneficiary wished to terminate the accumulation. Similarly, if the trusts are held for a tenant for life, and then for the benefit of a remainderman, both tenant for life and remainderman may decide to terminate the trusts and obtain the capital immediately, and agree a partition of the funds between them; this situation often occurs where changes in the revenue laws means that upon the death of the tenant for life the trust fund may be subject to inheritance tax {{in a way that was}} not envisaged when the trust fund was originally set up.|$|R
40|$|This thesis acts as {{an initial}} attempt to {{investigate}} how the relationship between one’s generational belonging, educational level, gender and membership {{in a variety of}} organizations on the matter of vertical and horizontal trust vary with one’s primary country of origin. Building on data from Riks-SOM 2014, it is shown that one’s primary country of origin not seem to have a unique effect on several of our selected variables on trust. Despite some variation amongst the variables, the results provide a picture of what in previous literature has been described as prosperous traits for the <b>accumulation</b> of <b>trust</b> amongst individuals still are of relevance within in the contemporary Swedish society. The primary focus is thus to be found at a micro-level. Also, the results show that the effect of one’s primary country of origin on our predictor variables is weaker than initially expected, leading to the rejection of some of our hypotheses. This does not indicate the absence of a trust-gap amongst Swedish citizens, as some results provide strength to such claims. However, the central point this thesis wishes to bring forth concerns that contemporary policy-makers should put its focus on promoting the importance of education post-high school level, and membership in certain organizations if the aim is to increase and promote trust for all within our contemporary Swedish society, as the logistic regression analyses here presented tells us a story of that such traits are beneficial for the <b>accumulation</b> of <b>trust...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} an A&M trust emerged in England and Wales after the {{enactment}} of the Capital Taxes Act 1974 (CTA). The CTA discouraged the use of discretionary trusts by introducing new tax rules, but it made a specific exception for trusts designed to help young people under the age of 25. This particular type of trust grew in significance over the years and became known as an <b>Accumulation</b> & Maintenance <b>Trust.</b> They came to fall under the purview of s.71 Inheritance Tax Act 1984 (IHTA), which continued their special tax treatment ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the determinants of}} social capital, as generalized trust, from a microeconomic perspective. We review previous results at the aggregate level and test their significance in our setup. Specifically we aim at testing the role of political participation {{and the quality of}} institutions. The empirical work relies on microeconomic data from the 2008 wave of the European Social Survey, including 21 European countries and roughly 41, 000 observations on a wide set of socio-economic and political variables. Preliminary results underline the role of political participation in the <b>accumulation</b> of generalized <b>trust,</b> while data are consistent with institutional quality being a consequence and not a cause of trust. trust, governance, institutional quality, multivariate probit modeling...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{diseases}} can {{impact on}} crop yields and disrupt food supply chains. It is surprising, therefore, that {{a detailed analysis}} of key actor responses to disease risk has not been undertaken. This paper examines grower and agronomist perceptions, and their relationships, in the management of plant disease in two UK arable sectors: wheat and potatoes. Applying social science concepts of risk, trust and agricultural knowledges, interviews were conducted with 30 growers and 10 agronomists in Lincolnshire (Eastern England) and Herefordshire (West Midlands). A majority of growers had a broad fungicide spray programme for their crops, rather than a formal plan, and this was guided by their previous experiences and advice from agronomists. For agronomists, flexible spray programmes were also seen as essential, based on knowledge of the local area, disease pressure and prevailing weather patterns. Neither growers nor agronomists rely solely on scientific knowledge (risk as analysis) in their decision-making and intuitive responses (risk as feeling) also {{play an important role in}} plant disease management. The influence of agronomists varies from almost complete grower dependence to occasional use and verification. However, the knowledge exchange encounters between growers and agronomists are increasingly interactive and reflect personality and the <b>accumulation</b> of <b>trust</b> between them rather than factors such as farm size, farm type, area and the age of the farmer...|$|R

40|$|Saving clubs or stokvels {{have been}} around {{in many parts of}} the World, under {{different}} names, for many years and they have been instrumental in teaching people how to save. This research sets to investigate the possible use of stokvels as vehicles, channels or conduits for wealth accumulation among migrant population living in the inner city of Johannesburg. Participants’ contributions and the extent this translates into wealth accumulation among members were critically examined. Furthermore, the study explored whether gender plays any role in terms of stokvels membership and the reasons thereof. The hypothesis of this research was that incomes from stokvels contribute to wealth accumulation of migrants in the inner city of Johannesburg. This study used both quantitative and qualitative research methods to address the research questions and gather relevant data. The use of a mixed approach was adopted as it allows a deeper exploration of the different research objectives and questions of the study. Thematic content analysis was used to analyse the data. The findings of this study have revealed that there is a positive relationship between membership to stokvels and wealth <b>accumulation.</b> Moreover, <b>trust</b> and social capital were found to be pivotal in ensuring success of these groups in terms of who should be accepted into the group. However, many other factors, such as the level of education, the length of stay in South Africa and the marital status of participants could have an impact on wealth status of participants...|$|R

30|$|In MANETs, trust can {{be defined}} as to what extent a node can fulfill the {{expectations}} of other node(s) as per the specification of an underlying communication protocol [11]. In trust-based security schemes, each node within the network manages an independent trust table to compute and store the trust values of other nodes. The routing decisions are based on the computed trust values of the nodes. Although a lot of research work has been carried in the field of trust and reputation based systems in MANETs, however, almost all the proposed schemes suffer from one basic problem known as bootstrapping problem [12]. It refers to the time required by the trust-based scheme to build trust and reputation among nodes in the network. Such delay in <b>accumulation</b> of <b>trust</b> and reputation is often not acceptable in time-critical applications. Due to the slow trust building process, a misbehaving node may have more opportunities to drop packets before being detected as malicious. One of the basic reasons for the aforementioned bootstrapping problem is that in most of the trust-based security schemes, an evaluated node’s trust is computed based on a single trust attribute, such as data forwarding [13 – 17]. Moreover, using single trust attribute may not effectively deal with the problem of selective misbehavior [12]. A smart malicious node may misbehave in the context of one network function and behave properly for other network functions. For example, a node may misbehave in the context of data forwarding while demonstrating good behavior when dealing with the control packet forwarding. As the existing schemes [7 – 10, 13 – 17] use single trust attribute, the aforementioned selective misbehaving node is declared as malicious node and isolated from the routing path, hence no longer will be available to be used for other network functions.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on a {{specific}} component of economically rel- evant trust, i. e. on what we call `institutionally produced generalized trust', defined {{as the amount of}} widespread trust (which is a public good for the economic system as a whole) endogenously and continuously gen- erated by the interaction of two types of private organizations operating in the economy: for-profit firms and nonprofit organizations. Through an evolutionary model with a <b>trust</b> <b>accumulation</b> equation and two replicator equations (capturing the evolution of economic organizations over time) we show that (1) The fixed point where all the four sub-types of private organizations considered in the model are simultaneously present can be attractive only if `virtuous' for-profits (i. e. socially responsible firms) and `virtuous' nonprofits (i. e. actually trustworthy mission-oriented organiza- tions) generate a negative externality on the other organizations of the same type. (2) The fixed point where the level of trust is very low and no socially responsible firms neither trustworthy organizations are present can be attractive; this social configuration interestingly recalls, to some extent, what some prominent social scientists depict as a trend currently occurring in the United States. (3) A socio-economic scenario where four pure population fixed points are simultaneously attractive exists. Generalized trust; socially responsible firms; nonprofit organizations; evolutionary games...|$|R
40|$|The {{ambition}} {{of the paper}} is certainly not to change substantially Breton and Wintrobe‘s story. We {{can be sure that}} many of the differentpieces that they have forged and assembled in their book v ill be replaced or modified in the course of time. This is the fate of all interesting theories. But only time-consuming and collective efforts can achieve this. The only {{ambition of}} this paper is a small beginning in that direction. Section II of the paper compares some of the mechanisms, others than trust, vhich have been proposed to explain self-enforcing exchanges. Then, Breton 8 nd Wint robe's modelling of <b>trust</b> and <b>trust</b> <b>accumulation</b> is looked at critically in Section III. Section IV presents an alternative mechanism, inspired by the Popperian philosophy of the grovth of knovledge. Up to that point, we are concerned only vith the foundations part of the story. However, in Section Y, partly as anapplication of ideas presented in the previous sections and partly on the basis of some other ideas introduced at that stage, I analyze a particular kind of network, the 'transbureau" network, based on horizontal trust. Since transbureau networks are compatible with vertical trust, and moreoverare efficient whenever there is enough of this vertical trust, an important prediction derived by Breton and Wi ntrobe is qualified...|$|R
30|$|Although Chinese context {{emphasizes}} emotional trust {{more than}} the Western context does, the utilitarian and rational calculation is the fundamental operational logic in many social contexts, especially in business Generally speaking, cognitive trust is constructed on the instrumental assessment of trustee’s capacity and quality based on contact experience and prestige. The trustor can build cognitive trust only when the trustee gives sufficient signals of reliability. Restricted by incomplete information within social interaction, the foundation of inter-organizational cognitive trust is more a comprehensive social assessment than an accurate calculation of capacity, quality, and reliability. In the context of Chinese society, social prestige signals the social status, social image, and personality of the potential trustee, serving as a critical medium of cognitive trust construction. What is more important is that the comprehensive social assessment, {{as a kind of}} group assessment, can easily transfer through weak ties and go beyond the boundary of the in-group to reach a large number of out-group members. The relative uniformity of the standard used in social assessment also promotes the acceptability of social prestige in certain social groups or social networks constituted by strangers. Hence, the trust relation on social prestige recognition possesses a relatively strong spillover effect. The <b>accumulation</b> of personal <b>trust</b> can transform and build toward group trust at the large scale, which is helpful to producing collective social capital. The recognition of social prestige implies rational assessment of reliability and qualification matching of classification homogeneity, which are integrated into the social construction of cognitive trust.|$|R
40|$|In earlier work, we {{examined}} emerging federal surpluses, based on CBO projections made last winter, and concluded {{they did not}} justify the large tax cuts that had been proposed. Most of the 10 -year projected surpluses accrued in {{the social security trust}} fund, which lawmakers have agreed should not be used for tax cuts. All of the remaining "on-budget" surplus was due to implausible assumptions about real discretionary spending cuts, and to strong assumptions about the recent surge in income tax revenues proving to be permanent. Even if the surpluses materialized as planned, over half of the on-budget surplus was due to <b>accumulations</b> in government <b>trust</b> funds for medicare and pensions, which [...] like social security [...] represent future promises to current workers and therefore should not be used to finance tax cuts. The long-term fiscal forecasts were even more troubling. CBO estimated that [...] even if the entire surplus was saved [...] a permanent and immediate tax increase or spending cut of 0. 6 percent of GDP was needed to maintain the same debt/GDP ratio in 2070 as obtains currently; our estimates showed that a 1. 5 percent of GDP tax or spending adjustment was needed to maintain the current debt/GDP ratio in the long run. Tax cuts would raise these gaps significantly. And despite record aggregate tax revenues, the data showed that families at most points of the income distribution faced lower federal tax burdens than they would have with similar real income in the past. In this paper, we update and extend our previous analysis {{to take into account the}} Congressional Budget Office's July, 1999 budget forecast, the details of the tax cut plan passed by the House and Senate this summer, and the President's plan for allocating the surplus. We find that the budget forecasts changed b [...] ...|$|R
