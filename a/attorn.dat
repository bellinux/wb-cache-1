2500|$|After {{the death}} of John’s half-brother, Hugh Devereux of Chanston, in 1307, the {{settlement}} of the ownership of Chanston manor was brought into court during the Easter Term 1308. Nicholas III Devereux of Chanston, John’s nephew, and his coparceners (David le Seriaunt, John and Sarah Ragun with their son John, and Maud widow of Richard le Bret) claimed portions of the manor, and contested Hugh Devereux’s grant to John and Eva Devereux. [...] Nicholas III Devereux of Chanston claimed a third part of Chanston that he held {{at the time of}} Hugh’s death. He showed evidence that Hugh had granted all his rights in this land that comprised the dower of Isabel, widow of Nicholas II Devereux of Chanston and mother of Hugh, in the village of Aynaldestone, and that this occurred prior to any grant to John Devereux. David le Serriaunt made claim to 5 acres that similarly Hugh had granted him. John and Eva Devereux countered that their grant came first. John and Sarah Ragun with their under-age son, John, put forward their claim of 6 marks of rent in the manor that they were to hold for 5 years. These issues were held over until the octave of Michaelmas (6 October 1308) Maud le Bret contested 12 acres of meadow that was granted by Hugh to the Raguns for life, which Hugh afterwards granted the reversion to Richard and Maud le Bret and their heirs (Richard le Bret Junior). These issues were further held over until the quindene of Easter (14 April 1309). Due to John, son of John and Sarah Ragun, being under-age, it was judged he could not <b>attorn</b> until he came of age.|$|E
50|$|Other intersections {{can also}} occur with {{interests}} in land. For example, a lender that grants a mortgage over a rental property will also register a PPSA security interest against the rents being generated, {{in order to}} <b>attorn</b> the rents in the event the mortgage goes into default.|$|E
50|$|Your Committee {{recommend}} that Messrs. H. B. Donaldson and Co. be called upon as provided by Section 76 of the Act {{to remove their}} sunken hulk in Hobson's Bay at Sandridge within a reasonable time (to be named in the notice), and should they fail to remove the said hulk within such time, that she be removed by the Trust as provided by the said Section. Your Committee further {{recommend that}} the firm named and Messrs. Stewart, White and Co. {{be called upon to}} <b>attorn</b> tenants to the trust under conditions to be submitted by this Committee to the Commissioners and approved by them.|$|E
50|$|In mortgages, an {{attornment}} clause is a clause whereby the mortgagor <b>attorns</b> tenant to the mortgagee, thus giving the mortgagee {{the right to}} distrain, as an additional security. As used in modern legal transactions, the term attornment refers to an acknowledgment {{of the existence of}} the relationship of landlord and tenant. A tenant often has the duty under the tenant's lease, particularly in commercial leases, to provide an attornment upon request, and is required by a creditor or potential buyer of property from the landlord to establish the nature of existing encumbrances on and income streams flowing from a property, as an element of the due diligence process associated with the transaction. Frequently, a tenant must declare the existence of any outstanding disputes with the landlord at the time the attornment is executed and waives any dispute not declared at that time.|$|R
5000|$|In summer 1242 the {{inheritance}} of 2 hides {{of land in}} Erdicot (Gloucester) valued at 100 shillings was disputed, and the possession was shown to be held of the Prior of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem by warranty of Nicholas Pointz through charter of William Devereux. Devereux claimed that this should revert to him based on the terms of inheritance. [...] About 1243 William Devereux was again called to answer why the 100 shillings of this land had not been paid, and the Prior called to answer why he withheld William’s charter. On 25 March 1244 the Hospitallers <b>attorned</b> Robert le Deveneis and William Joindre in the ongoing dispute over the unjust withholding of the charter. On 11 February 1255 further disputes regarding Oxenhall required the King to grant William peace from the sheriffs of the county until they were settled.|$|R
25|$|On 8 June 1237 Fulk fitzWarin <b>attorned</b> {{before the}} king, John Devereux, and Richard de Rocheford {{in the matter}} of an assise de morte d’ancestor, which Fulk claimed against John Travers and Hugh Purcell for the land in Docoinell Glencaveran. About 1244 John Devereux granted to his son, Vincent de Ebroicis, and his heirs his {{remaining}} five carucates (600 acres) of land in Ireland representing the fourth part of a knight’s service of the fee of Donoughmore, barony of Fertagh. The fee extends between the Cullahill Mountains to the east of side of the river Nore at Ballyragget, and borders on the southwest with Philip de Rocheford’s lands in the parish of Sheffin, and on the south with the monks of Jerpoint in Grangemacomb. It also possessed the common of pasture and woods in Odogh. It was witnessed by two of his other sons: Richard Devereux, and Warin Devereux. Donoughmore lies {{on the east side of}} the river Nore at Ballyragget with the fee of Donoughmore extending along the west bank, and the five carucates taking in the ancient parish of Achteyr alias Aharney.|$|R
50|$|In 1308 Hugh’s eldest son, Nicholas III Devereux, and his co-parceners David le Seriaunt, John and Sarah Ragun {{with their}} son John, and Maud (widow of Richard le Bret) were called to court to provide {{evidence}} for their claim to portions of Chanston manor. Part of the manor had previously been granted in court by Hugh Devereux to his brother, John Devereux and his wife Eva. In 1308/9 John and Eva Devereux filed a writ to compel these individuals {{to turn over the}} rights to these lands for which they held the reversion as granted by Hugh Devereux. Nicholas III Devereux claimed his father had granted him these lands prior to the grant of reversion to John and Eva. The defendants were allowed not to <b>attorn</b> due to one of the co-parceners not being an adult, and therefore he could not be disinherited while under age.|$|E

5000|$|In Russia, he {{is known}} as the first of the Russians who has been ever {{initiated}} in the Nath tradition. The principal spiritual Master (mula-guru) of Yogi Matsyendranath Maharaj in the Nath lineage is Yogi Shri Mithileshnath Maharaj, the head of the Patan Devi Mandir (Tulsipur, Uttar Pradesh). Yogi Matsyendranath was completely trained in Nath Sampradaya in India, he has been ordained to be a Guru and <b>attorned</b> the authority to initiate adepts into the Tradition. He has translated and published several fundamental texts belonging to the Nath Tradition from Indian languages into Russian. In addition, under his guidance the magazine [...] "Adesh", dedicated to the Nath Tradition, has been issuing since 2008 to the present. Moreover, Yogi Matsyendranath also learned from other Gurus in India, who are well known nowadays in Russia thanks to his support and activity. Among them we can mention Vagish Shastri, Rakesh Pandey, Ramacandra Seth and others. Yogi Matsyendranath has his disciples and followers all over the world in such countries as Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and other countries of the former Soviet Union, as well as in Europe (Spain, Latvia, Lithuania, Germany, France, etc.), America, Australia, Israel, South Korea. He promotes the Nath Tradition, which traces back to the ancient yoga teacher Gorakshanath — the founder and distributor of Hatha Yoga. Despite the fact that modern Hatha Yoga is largely oversimplified and has assumed rather a form of fitness nowadays, having lost its spiritual content, the influence of the Nath Tradition upon this mass social phenomenon is still significant.|$|R
