As it happened, {{in the same}} lodging-house {{where he had been}} living for the last few months, two {{brothers}} of the name of Short had rooms, and with these young gentlemen he had become very friendly. The two Shorts were twins, and so like one another that {{it was more than a}} month before Eustace could be sure which of them he was speaking to. When they were both at college their father died, leaving his property equally between them; and as this property on realisation was not found to amount to more than four hundred a year, the twins very rightly concluded that they had better do something to supplement their moderate income. Accordingly, by a stroke of genius they determined that one of them should become a solicitor and the other a barrister, and then tossed up as to which should take to which trade. The idea, of course, was that in this manner they would be able to afford each other mutual comfort and support. John would give James briefs, and James' reflected glory would shine back on John.

Natural conversations between Mandarin-speaking two-year-olds {{and their parents}} were analyzed, focusing on the lexicon of affect words and the conversational interactions in which these words were used.

"In a {{very few}} minutes after the doors were opened the large hall was filled in every part, and when up the central passage the Principal, the Lord Rector, the Members of the Senate, and other gentlemen {{advanced}} towards the platform, the cheering was vociferous and hearty. The Principal occupied the chair of course, the Lord Rector on his right, the Lord Provost on his left. Every eye was fixed on the Rector. To all appearance, as he sat, time and labour had dealt tenderly with him. His face had not yet lost the country bronze which he brought up with him from Dumfriesshire as a student fifty-six years ago. His long residence in London had not touched his Annandale look, nor had it--as we soon learned--touched his Annandale accent. His countenance was striking, homely, sincere, truthful--the countenance of a man on whom 'the burden of the unintelligible world' had weighed more heavily than on most. His hair was yet almost dark; his moustache and short beard were iron grey. His eyes were wide, melancholy, sorrowful; and seemed {{as if they had}} been at times a-weary of the sun. Altogether in his aspect there was something aboriginal, as of a piece, of unhewn granite, which had never been polished to any <b>approved</b> <b>pattern,</b> whose natural and original vitality had never been tampered with. In a word, there seemed no passivity about Mr. Carlyle--he was the diamond, and the world was his pane of glass; he was a graving tool rather than a thing graven upon--a man to set his mark on the world--a man on whom the world could not set its mark. And just as, glancing towards Fife a few minutes before, one could not help thinking of his early connection with Edward Irving, so seeing him sit beside the venerable Principal of the University, one could not help thinking of his earliest connection with literature.|$|E
60|$|All of which, again, is but to {{say that}} the STEPS, for my fable, placed {{themselves}} with a prompt and, as it were, functional assurance--an air quite as of readiness to have dispensed with logic had I been in fact too stupid for my clue. Never, positively, none the less, as the links multiplied, had I felt less stupid than for the determination of poor Strether's errand and for the apprehension of his issue. These things continued to fall together, as by the neat action of their own weight and form, even while their commentator scratched his head about them; he easily sees now that they were always well in advance of him. As the case completed itself he had in fact, from a good way behind, to catch up with them, breathless and a little flurried, as he best could. THE false position, for our belated man of the world--belated because he had endeavoured so long to escape being one, and now at last had really to face his doom--the false position for him, I say, was obviously to have presented himself at the gate of that boundless menagerie primed with a moral scheme of the most <b>approved</b> <b>pattern</b> which was yet framed to break down on any approach to vivid facts; that is to any at all liberal appreciation of them. There would have been of course the case of the Strether prepared, wherever presenting himself, only to judge and to feel meanly; but HE would have moved for me, I confess, enveloped in no legend whatever. The actual man's note, from the first of our seeing it struck, is the note of discrimination, just as his drama is to become, under stress, the drama of discrimination. It would have been his blest imagination, we have seen, that had already helped him to discriminate; the element that was for so much of the pleasure of my cutting thick, as I have intimated, into his intellectual, into his moral substance. Yet here it was, at the same time, just here, that a shade for a moment fell across the scene.|$|E
6000|$|The great Kentucky error, however, {{had been}} the {{introduction}} into a free State of two pieces of precious property which our friends were to fail to preserve, the pair of affectionate black retainers whose presence contributed most to their exotic note. We revelled {{in the fact that}} Davy and Aunt Sylvia (pronounced An'silvy,) a light-brown lad with extraordinarily shining eyes and his straight, grave, deeper-coloured mother, not radiant as to anything but her vivid turban, had been born and kept in slavery of the most <b>approved</b> <b>pattern</b> and such as this intensity of their condition made them a joy, a joy to the curious mind, to consort with. Davy mingled in our sports and talk, he enriched, he adorned them with a personal, a pictorial lustre that none of us could emulate, and servitude in the absolute thus did more for him socially than we had ever seen done, above stairs or below, for victims of its lighter forms. What was not our dismay therefore when we suddenly learnt--it must have blown right up and down the street--that mother and son had fled, in the dead of night, from bondage? had taken advantage of their visit to the North simply to leave the house and not return, covering their tracks, successfully disappearing. They had never been for us so beautifully slaves as in this achievement of their freedom; for they did brilliantly achieve it--they escaped, on northern soil, beyond recall or recovery. I think we had already then, on the spot, the sense of some degree of presence at the making of history; the question of what persons of colour and of their condition might or mightn't do was intensely in the air; this was exactly the season of the freshness of Mrs. Stowe's great novel. It must have come out at the moment of our fondest acquaintance with our neighbours, though I have no recollection of hearing them remark upon it--any remark they made would have been sure to be so strong. I suspect they hadn't read it, as they certainly wouldn't have allowed it in the house; any more indeed than they had read or were likely ever to read any other work of fiction; I doubt whether the house contained a printed volume, unless its head had had in hand a law-book or so: I to some extent recover Mr. Norcom as a lawyer who had come north on important, difficult business, on contentious, precarious grounds--a large bald political-looking man, very loose and ungirt, just as his wife was a desiccated, depressed lady who mystified me by always wearing her nightcap, a feebly-frilled but tightly-tied and unmistakable one, and the compass of whose maternal figure beneath a large long collarless cape or mantle defined imperfectly for me of course its connection with the further increase of Albert's little brothers and sisters, there being already, by my impression, two or three of these in the background. Had Davy and An'silvy at least read Uncle Tom?--that question might well come up for us, with the certainty at any rate that they ignored him less than their owners were doing. These latter good people, who had been so fond of their humble dependents and supposed this affection returned, were shocked at such ingratitude, though I remember taking a vague little inward Northern comfort in their inability, in their discreet decision, not to raise the hue and cry. Wasn't one even just dimly aware of the heavy hush that, in the glazed gallery, among the sausages and the johnny-cakes, had followed the first gasp of resentment? I think the honest Norcoms were in any case astonished, let alone being much incommoded; just as we were, for that matter, when the genial family itself, installed so at its ease, failed us with an effect of abruptness, simply ceased, in their multitude, to be there. I don't remember their going, nor any pangs of parting; I remember only knowing with wonderment that they had gone, that obscurity had somehow engulfed them; and how afterwards, in the light of later things, memory and fancy attended them, figured their history as the public complication grew and the great intersectional plot thickened; felt even, absurdly and disproportionately, that they had helped one to [...] "know Southerners." [...] The slim, the sallow, the straight-haired and dark-eyed Eugene in particular haunted my imagination; he had not been my comrade of election--he was too much my senior; but I cherished the thought of the fine fearless young fire-eater he would have become and, when the War had broken out, I know not what dark but pitying vision of him stretched stark after a battle.|$|E

Sir John Lubbock, who has paid great attention to the mutual relations of ants and aphides, has even shown that various kinds of ants domesticate various species of aphis. The common brown garden-ant, one of the darkest skinned among our English races, 'devotes itself principally to aphides which frequent twigs and leaves'; especially, so far as I have myself observed, the bright green aphis of the rose, and the closely allied little black aphis of the broad bean. On the other hand a nearly related reddish ant pays attention chiefly to those aphides which live on the bark of trees, while the yellow meadow-ants, a far more subterranean species, keep flocks and herds of the like-minded aphides which feed upon the roots of herbs and grasses.|$|R

40|$|The {{western corn rootworm}} (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte) is a notorious, {{long-term}} pest of corn in the Midwest, having developed {{resistance to}} many pesticides {{as well as the}} cultural control practice of crop rotation. After nearly a century of research, the western corn rootworm is still abundant and difficult to control; resulting in millions of dollars in losses and some of the highest per acre pesticide use in the United States. ^ Transgenic, or Bt corn, which contains a Bt toxin originally isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis, provides effective rootworm control and reduces pesticide use. However, due to the adaptable nature of the pest, resistance management is necessary in order to extend the durability of this management tactic. Resistance management is currently accomplished, according to the guidelines established by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), using the refuge strategy. A refuge, or section of corn plants that are not resistant to rootworm larvae, is planted with the Bt corn in one of several <b>approved</b> <b>patterns.</b> In order for this strategy to be effective, the refuge must provide a large reservoir of susceptible insects that mate with any potentially resistant insects surviving on Bt corn. To optimize refuge design and performance, a strong understanding of western corn rootworm biology and mating behavior in the Bt corn cropping system is crucial. This research examined: (1) the impact of refuge structure on western corn rootworm emergence timing and root damage, (2) the influence of natal host plants on adult head capsule width, (3) the composition and fate of the spermatophore, and (4) differences in the cuticular hydrocarbons of western corn rootworm based on several factors, including mating status and natal host (i. e., refuge or Bt corn). ^ Three refuge structures (i. e., block, strip or seed mix) at two different sizes (10 or 20 %) were evaluated, using rootworm emergence rates, in field plots over two seasons. The results indicated that western corn rootworm emergence from refuge and Bt corn plants was more synchronous in a seed mix refuge compared to the structured refuge treatments. This synchrony was best explained by larval movement between refuge and Bt corn plants, which was evidenced by an increase in root damage on Bt corn roots, and a decrease in root damage on refuge plants when refuge and Bt corn plants were in close proximity to each other. When the head capsule widths of beetles emerging from different host plants were compared, males emerging from Bt corn had significantly smaller head capsules. Western corn rootworm spermatophores, analyzed using a Bradford assay for proteins and an anthrone assay for sugar content, were found to contain relatively high levels of protein as well as minor amounts of sugar. The proteins were traced using the stable isotope, 15 N, and the results indicated that the nitrogen received from males in the spermatophore is incorporated into the eggs by the female. Male head capsule width, pronotum width, and elytral length were found to have a significant positive relationship with spermatophore size. Cuticular hydrocarbons of western corn rootworms were sampled using solid-phase microextraction and were then analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Hydrocarbon profiles were compared on the basis of mating status, natal host (i. e., refuge or Bt corn) and sex. Some significant quantitative differences were identified between males that developed on different host plants, as well as between males and females. ^ The synchrony of western corn rootworm emergence from refuge and Bt corn in seed mix refuge structures is advantageous for resistance management because it promotes mating between beetles emerging from refuge and Bt corn plants. Nevertheless, the larval movement between refuge and Bt corn, inferred from root damage data, is concerning because it could result in sublethal exposure to Bt toxins (as evidenced by the reduced head capsule width of males emerging from Bt corn), which may partially offset resistance management efforts. However, the diminished head capsule width of males from Bt corn may actually assist resistance management if males with larger head capsules (i. e., those from the refuge) have greater mating success and provide females with larger spermatophores. Overall, these results are favorable for the adoption of seed mix refuge structures as a resistance management strategy for western corn rootworm. ...|$|R

40|$|Plato’s {{theory of}} {{punishment}} distinguishes scientifically administered measures, {{which may or}} may not take the form of actual punishment designed to cure a criminal of his offence which is a disease of the soul, not something which is an inseparable part of the concrete criminal act.

Plato does not commit himself to the view that all forms of punishment benefits the criminal as he reasons that only just punishment has this effect. Capital punishment in Plato’s penology is reserved for the incurable and the bad men themselves would seem better candidates for this penalty than those who in spite of propensities to vice yet succeed in avoiding the greatest judgement. The mere infliction of suffering (timoria) makes people worse than they already were; they will not be cured or deterred as they will go from bad to worse, ultimately become incorrigible and bound to be executed as an example to others. Curing or rehabilitating the criminal in practice will mean the reshaping of his character to a <b>pattern</b> <b>approved</b> by the authorities. The death penalty is imposed for the worst offenders but in Plato’s opinion it is not considered to be an extreme penalty. This paradox can only be understood when pondered through Platonic assumptions about morality, happiness and existence after death...|$|R
