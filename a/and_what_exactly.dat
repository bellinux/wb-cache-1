25|$|The movement, {{on the wane}} {{at the end of}} April, now regained {{significant}} momentum. By 17 May, {{as students}} from across the country poured into the capital to join the movement, protests of varying sizes were occurring in some 400 Chinese cities. Students demonstrated at provincial party headquarters in Fujian, Hubei, and Xinjiang. Without a clearly articulated official position from the Beijing leadership, local authorities {{did not know how to}} respond. Since the demonstrations now incorporated a wide array of social groups, each carrying its own set of grievances, it became increasingly unclear with whom the government should negotiate, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> the demands were. The government, continuing to be split on how to deal with the movement, saw its authority and legitimacy gradually erode as the hunger strikers took the limelight and gained widespread sympathy. These combined circumstances put immense pressure on the authorities to act, and martial law was discussed as a viable response.|$|E

Bennington met with an acting coach to prepare for his role.

500|$|The movie stages re-creations {{of various}} scenarios, {{based on the}} {{testimony}} of key players and suspects, including Van der Sloot. The broadcast of the film attracted 3.2 million viewers, garnering the highest television ratings in the network's 11-year history. Although it set ratings records for Lifetime, the movie received mixed reviews from critics. Alec Harvey of The Birmingham News called the movie [...] "sloppy and uneven, a forgettable look at the tragedy that consumed the nation's attention for months." [...] However, Jake Meaney of PopMatters found the film to be surprisingly [...] "calm and levelheaded", and praised Pollan's portrayal of Holloway's mother. A follow-up film, Justice for Natalee Holloway, aired in mid-2011 on LMN. This film picks up in 2010, on the five-year anniversary of Holloway's disappearance. It continues to center on the investigation <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> happened to Holloway.|$|E

500|$|Colley's death horrified Kruger, {{who feared}} it might {{jeopardise}} the peace process. His reply to Colley's letter {{was delivered to}} his successor Sir Evelyn Wood on 7 March 1881, a day after Wood and Joubert had agreed to an eight-day truce. Kruger was outraged to learn of this armistice, which in his view only gave the British opportunity to strengthen their forces—he expected a British attempt to avenge Majuba, which indeed Wood and others wanted—but Gladstone wanted peace, and Wood was instructed to proceed with talks. Negotiations began on 16 March. The British offered amnesty for the Boer leaders, retrocession of the Transvaal under British suzerainty, a British resident in Pretoria and British control over foreign affairs. Kruger pressed on how the British intended to withdraw <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> [...] "suzerainty" [...] meant. Brand arrived to mediate on 20 March and the following day agreement was reached; the British committed to formally restore the republic within six months.

500|$|For the collaboration, Fraser McAlpine from BBC Radio 1 {{reviewed}} the song negatively, writing: [...] "So anyway, this {{brings me to}} 'Video Phone' – <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> {{is the point of}} Gaga featuring in this song? I know Beyoncé fans won't like me saying this, but I can't help but think that in this instance it's a case of 'if you can't beat em, join em' [...] For someone as naturally brilliant as Beyoncé (and a better singer than Gaga and Rihanna put together), perhaps she should actually stop trying so hard and do what she does best - singing proper songs." [...] Chris Willman from Yahoo! compared the song to Gaga's [...] "Telephone", where Knowles appears as a featured artist, and wrote that [...] "Maybe it's because the lack of a video for Gaga's [...] "Telephone" [...] leaves more to the imagination, but if this were a contest, I'd have to say her tune trumps Beyoncé's. [...] greatest promises of unbridled exhibitionism can't quite make the genre feel fresh." [...] The New York Times Jon Caramanica commented that [...] "Video Phone" [...] and [...] "Telephone", [...] "promised a new direction, but all Beyoncé did was show up to prove she could out-Gaga Gaga, then return to her comfort zone." [...] Kyle Anderson of MTV, felt that [...] "Gaga got a bit lost in the mix" [...] of [...] "Video Phone".

We thought of the characters in the unconvincing wigs and costumes of our school performance. No Gilbert Murray had come as yet to touch these things to life again.

60|$|The incident, {{which had}} {{produced}} a somewhat marked effect {{in regard to}} the treatment of animals all round that neighborhood, had never been forgotten, nor in a sense forgiven. In conjunction with the extraordinary peace and mildness of his general behavior, it had endowed Tod with mystery; and people, especially simple folk, cannot bring themselves to feel quite at home with mystery. Children only--to whom everything is so mysterious that nothing can be--treated him as he treated them, giving him their hands with confidence. But children, even his own, as they grew up, began to have a little of the village feeling toward Tod; his world was not theirs, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> his world was they could not grasp. Possibly it was the sense that they partook of his interest and affection too much on a level with any other kind of living thing that might happen to be about, which discomfited their understanding.

6000|$|There are men whom {{a really}} bad bit of news at once stampedes out of all power of {{coherent}} thought and action, and men who at first simply do not take it in. Old Heythorp took it in fast enough; coming from a lawyer it was about as nasty as it could be. But, at once, with stoic wariness his old brain began casting round. What did this fellow really know? <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> could he do? One thing was certain; even if he knew everything, he couldn't upset that settlement. The youngsters were all right. The old man grasped {{the fact that only}} his own position was at stake. But this was enough in all conscience; a name which had been before the public fifty odd years--income, independence, more perhaps. It would take little, seeing his age and feebleness, to make his Companies throw him over. But what had the fellow got hold of? How decide whether or no to take notice; to let him do his worst, or try and get into touch with him? And what was the fellow's motive? He held ten shares! That would never make a man take all this trouble, and over a purchase which was really first-rate business for the Company. Yes! His conscience was quite clean. He had not betrayed his Company--on the contrary, had done it a good turn, got them four sound ships at a low price--against much opposition. That he might have done the Company a better turn, and got the ships at fifty-four thousand, did not trouble him--the six thousand was a deuced sight better employed; and he had not pocketed a penny piece himself! But the fellow's motive? Spite? Looked like it. Spite, because he had been disappointed of his money, and defied into the bargain! H'm! If that were so, he might still be got to blow cold again. His eyes lighted on the pink note with the blue forget-me-not. It marked as it were the high water mark of what was left to him of life; and this other letter in his hand-by Jove! Low water mark! And with a deep and rumbling sigh he thought: 'No, I'm not going to be beaten by this fellow.' ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{very easy}} to repeat our initial propositions, to recall that we are on another planet, and that all the customs and traditions of the earth are set aside, but the faintest {{realisation}} of that demands a feat of psychological insight. We have all grown up into an invincible mould of suggestion about sexual things; we regard this with approval, that with horror, and this again with contempt, very largely because the thing has always been put to us in this light or that. The more emancipated we think ourselves the more subtle are our bonds. The disentanglement of what is inherent in these feelings from what is acquired is an extraordinary complex undertaking. Probably all men and women have a more or less powerful disposition to jealousy, but what exactly they will be jealous about <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>exactly</b> they will suffer seems part of the superposed factor. Probably all men and women are capable of ideal emotions and wishes beyond merely physical desires, but the shape these take are almost entirely a reaction to external images. And you really cannot strip the external off; you cannot get your stark natural man, jealous, but not jealous about anything in particular, imaginative without any imaginings, proud at large. Emotional dispositions can no more exist without form than a man without air. Only a very observant man who had lived all over the planet Earth, in all sorts of social strata, and with every race and tongue, and who was endowed with great imaginative insight, could hope to understand the possibilities and the limitations of human plasticity in this matter, and say what any men and any women could be induced to do willingly, and just exactly what no man and no woman could stand, provided one had the training of them. Though very young men will tell you readily enough. The proceedings of other races and other ages do not seem to carry conviction; what our ancestors did, or what the Greeks or Egyptians did, though it is the direct physical cause of the modern young man or the modern young lady, is apt to impress these remarkable consequences merely as an arrangement of quaint, comical or repulsive proceedings.|$|E
