5|$|Owing {{to their}} ability to fix {{molecular}} nitrogen and therefore increase the soil fertility and stimulate plant growth, Azotobacter species are widely used in agriculture, particularly in nitrogen biofertilizers such as azotobacterin. They are also used in production of alginic acid, which is applied in medicine as an <b>antacid,</b> in the food industry as an additive to ice cream, puddings, and creams.|$|E

5000|$|A 1981 {{study by}} the National Institutes of Health showed that <b>antacids</b> {{administered}} concomitantly with phenytoin [...] "altered not only the extent of absorption but also appeared to alter the rate of absorption. <b>Antacids</b> administered in a peptic ulcer regimen may decrease the AUC of a single dose of phenytoin. Patients should be cautioned against concomitant use of <b>antacids</b> and phenytoin." ...|$|R
5000|$|Malabsorption - This {{includes}} GI damage, {{and also}} failure to absorb phosphate {{due to lack}} of vitamin D, or chronic use of phosphate binders such as sucralfate, aluminum-containing <b>antacids,</b> and (more rarely) calcium-containing <b>antacids.</b>|$|R
25|$|Calcium {{carbonate}} {{is widely}} used medicinally as an inexpensive dietary calcium supplement for gastric <b>antacid</b> (e.g., Tums). It {{may be used as}} a phosphate binder for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia (primarily in patients with chronic renal failure). It is also used in the pharmaceutical industry as an inert filler for tablets and other pharmaceuticals.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} for antacids is weaker with a benefit of about 10% (NNT=13) while {{a combination of}} an <b>antacid</b> and alginic acid (such as Gaviscon) may improve symptoms 60% (NNT=4). Metoclopramide (a prokinetic) is not recommended either alone or {{in combination with other}} treatments due to concerns around adverse effects. The benefit of the prokinetic mosapride is modest.|$|E
25|$|Calcium {{carbonate}} is {{a chemical}} compound with the formula CaCO3. It {{is a common}} substance found in rocks as the minerals calcite and aragonite (most notably as limestone, which contains both of those minerals) and is {{the main component of}} pearls and the shells of marine organisms, snails, and eggs. Calcium carbonate is the active ingredient in agricultural lime and is created when calcium ions in hard water react with carbonate ions to create limescale. It is medicinally used as a calcium supplement or as an <b>antacid,</b> but excessive consumption can be hazardous.|$|E
25|$|<b>Antacids</b> are {{a common}} {{treatment}} for mild to medium gastritis. When <b>antacids</b> do not provide enough relief, medications such as H2 blockers and proton-pump inhibitors that help {{reduce the amount of}} acid are often prescribed.|$|R
25|$|In pregnancy, dietary {{modifications}} {{and lifestyle}} changes may be attempted, but often have little effect. Calcium-based <b>antacids</b> are recommended if {{these changes are}} not effective. Aluminum- and magnesium-based <b>antacids</b> are also safe, as is ranitidine and PPIs.|$|R
25|$|People {{who suffer}} from {{infrequent}} heartburn may take either <b>antacids</b> or H2-receptor antagonists for treatment. The H2-antagonists offer several advantages over <b>antacids,</b> including longer duration of action (6–10 hours vs 1–2 hours for <b>antacids),</b> greater efficacy, and ability to be used prophylactically before meals to reduce the chance of heartburn occurring. Proton pump inhibitors, however, are the preferred treatment for erosive esophagitis since they {{have been shown to}} promote healing better than H2-antagonists.|$|R
25|$|Methyl-B12 {{is absorbed}} by two processes. The first is an {{intestinal}} mechanism using intrinsic factor through which 1–2 micrograms can be absorbed every few hours. The second is a diffusion {{process by which}} approximately 1% of the remainder is absorbed. The human physiology of vitamin B12 is complex, and therefore is prone to mishaps leading to vitamin B12 deficiency. Protein-bound vitamin B12 must be released from the proteins {{by the action of}} digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. Gastric acid releases the vitamin from food particles; therefore <b>antacid</b> and acid-blocking medications (especially proton-pump inhibitors) may inhibit absorption of B12.|$|E
25|$|For {{external}} exposure, bathing the {{mucous membrane}} surfaces that have contacted capsaicin with oily compounds such as vegetable oil, paraffin oil, petroleum jelly (Vaseline), creams, or polyethylene glycol {{is the most}} effective way to attenuate the associated discomfort; since oil and capsaicin are both hydrophobic hydrocarbons the capsaicin that has not already been absorbed into tissues will be picked up into solution and easily removed. Capsaicin can also be washed off the skin using soap, shampoo, or other detergents. Plain water is ineffective at removing capsaicin, as are bleach, sodium metabisulfite and topical <b>antacid</b> suspensions. Capsaicin is soluble in alcohol, which can be used to clean contaminated items.|$|E
500|$|When Taylor {{ordered a}} last meal of pizzas [...] "with everything," [...] some law {{enforcement}} veterans recalled {{that the same}} request was made by Barton Kay Kirkham, the last man to be hanged in Utah.

40|$|Six stable {{patients}} on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis were evaluated for {{the appearance of}} ciprofloxacin in their peritoneal dialysate following oral ingestion of 750 mg of the drug every 12 h for four doses. Three subjects {{participated in this study}} twice, once while taking and once while abstaining from phosphate-binding aluminum <b>antacids.</b> Subjects tolerated the medication without evidence of toxicity. Food may have delayed or decreased the absorption of ciprofloxacin, whereas <b>antacids</b> definitely decreased the absorption of the drug. Peak concentrations in serum noted in the absence of <b>antacids</b> ranged from 2. 9 to 6. 4 micrograms/ml, and peak concentrations in dialysate in the absence of <b>antacids</b> ranged from 1. 8 to 4. 5 micrograms/ml. Peak ciprofloxacin concentrations in serum achieved in subjects taking <b>antacids</b> were 14 to 50 % of those achieved in subjects without <b>antacids.</b> The peak concentrations in dialysate achieved in subjects on <b>antacids</b> were 8 to 33 % of those observed in subjects off <b>antacids.</b> The clearance of ciprofloxacin by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis represented 2 % of the total body (systemic) clearance. Simultaneous ratios of concentration in dialysate to concentration in serum (D/S) were determined at various durations of dialysate dwelling within the peritoneum. A progressive rise of the D/S ratio was noted as dwell time increased. At 4 h D/S was 0. 57 +/- 0. 07 (mean +/- standard error of the mean; n = 9), and at 8 h it was 0. 75 +/- 0. 04 (n = 26). Long-dwell exchanges may be necessary to achieve reasonable concentrations of orally ingested ciprofloxacin in dialysate...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{performed}} a randomized controlled trial {{to compare the}} efficacy of seven forms of maintenance treatment of duodenal ulcer, including a mealtime regimen of <b>antacids.</b> PATIENTS AND METHODS: We randomized 785 patients with healed duodenal ulcer to receive: (1) no treatment; (2) mealtime <b>antacids</b> with an acid-neutralizing capacity of 80 mmol/day; (3) an antidepressant, trimipramine 25 mg; (4) an anticholinergic, pirenzepine 50 mg; (5) cimetidine 200 mg; (6) cimetidine 400 mg; (7) ranitidine 150 mg; or (8) sucralfate 1 g twice a day. Symptomatology and side effects were assessed every 2 months and endoscopy was performed every 4 months up to 1 year. RESULTS: The patients were comparable {{in the majority of}} clinical characteristics before entry. The cumulative percentages of patients with relapse of ulcers at 12 months by life-table analysis were 61 % with no treatment, 38 % with mealtime <b>antacids,</b> 60 % with trimipramine, 52 % with pirenzepine, 46 % with cimetidine 200 mg, 44 % with cimetidine 400 mg, 30 % with ranitidine 150 mg, and 40 % with sucralfate. Cimetidine 400 mg, <b>antacids,</b> ranitidine 150 mg, and sucralfate were significantly better than no treatment and the other forms of treatment. Ranitidine was significantly better than <b>antacids,</b> cimetidine, and sucralfate in preventing endoscopically documented duodenal ulcer relapse by multiple comparison at 12 months, but not by life- table analysis nor when symptomatic relapses were compared. No significant difference was detected among <b>antacids,</b> cimetidine, and sucralfate. No major side effects occurred with the seven forms of treatment, but those receiving <b>antacids</b> had the highest incidence of minor adverse events (26 %). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that mealtime <b>antacids</b> are as effective as H 2 -receptor antagonists and sucralfate in the maintenance treatment of duodenal ulcer disease, but have to be taken three times a day and had the highest incidence of reported minor adverse events. The relapse rate was lower with ranitidine than with cimetidine, sucralfate, and <b>antacids,</b> but the difference was small and may not be clinically important. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

2500|$|If {{steps are}} taken to {{decrease}} potential risks, ECT is generally accepted to be relatively safe during all trimesters of pregnancy, particularly when compared to pharmacological treatments. Suggested preparation for ECT during pregnancy includes a pelvic examination, discontinuation of nonessential anticholinergic medication, uterine tocodynamometry, intravenous hydration, and administration of a nonparticulate <b>antacid.</b> During ECT, elevation of the pregnant woman's right hip, external fetal cardiac monitoring, intubation, and avoidance of excessive hyperventilation are recommended. [...] In many instances of active mood disorder during pregnancy, the risks of untreated symptoms may outweigh the risks of ECT. Potential complications of ECT during pregnancy can be minimized by modifications in technique. The use of ECT during pregnancy requires thorough evaluation of the patient’s capacity for informed consent.|$|E
