25|$|Two {{hypothesis}} {{tests are}} particularly widely used. First, {{one wants to}} know if the estimated regression equation is <b>any</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> simply predicting that all values of the response variable equal its sample mean (if not, it is said to have no explanatory power). The null hypothesis of no explanatory value of the estimated regression is tested using an F-test. If the calculated F-value is found to be large enough to exceed its critical value for the pre-chosen level of significance, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis, that the regression has explanatory power, is accepted. Otherwise, the null hypothesis of no explanatory power is accepted.|$|E
25|$|For 1999, Craven {{signed to}} drive the No. 58 Ford Taurus for Scott Barbour's SBIII Motorsports, a brand new team in NASCAR. He did not finish <b>any</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> 19th while driving the car and after he failed {{to qualify for the}} Coca-Cola 600, he was {{replaced}} by Loy Allen, Jr.. Several weeks later, he signed up with another new team Midwest Transit Racing, replacing rookie Dan Pardus in the No. 50 and finished the season with them. Craven returned to the team in 2000 but after failing to qualify for four of the first nine races of the season, the team switched to a part-time schedule. Following this decision, Craven had four Top 20 finishes but finished 44th in points.|$|E

25|$|The Bangladeshi second innings did {{not start}} <b>any</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the first. With Tamim Iqbal unable to open the batting having {{fractured}} his left thumb dropping one of the catches they had lost five wickets by stumps on the second day. All of the wickets had been caught behind the wicket, with wicket-keeper McCullum taking one and the remainder being caught by the slips. At {{the end of the}} day's play, Bangladesh were 51/5 needing a further 199 runs to make New Zealand bat again and thus avoid an innings defeat. On the third day, the Black Caps required only 25 more overs to dismiss Bangladesh for an innings win. Only Shakib Al Hasan offered any resistance, finishing on an unbeaten 41. Equally telling was that Bangladesh's highest-scoring partnership in their second innings was 30 on the last wicket.|$|E
25|$|A {{phototransistor}} is a light-sensitive transistor. A {{common type}} of phototransistor, called a photobipolar transistor, is in essence a bipolar transistor encased in a transparent case so that light can reach the base–collector junction. It was invented by Dr. John N. Shive (more famous for his wave machine) at Bell Labs in 1948, {{but it was not}} announced until 1950. The electrons that are generated by photons in the base–collector junction are injected into the base, and this photodiode current is amplified by the transistor's current gain β (or hfe). If the base and collector leads are used and the emitter is left unconnected, the phototransistor becomes a photodiode. While phototransistors have a higher responsivity for light they are not able to detect low levels of light <b>any</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> photodiodes. Phototransistors also have significantly longer response times. Field-effect phototransistors, also known as photoFETs, are light-sensitive field-effect transistors. Unlike photobipolar transistors, photoFETs control drain-source current by creating a gate voltage.|$|E
25|$|In the Mavericks' debut game, {{taking place}} in the brand-new Reunion Arena, the Mavericks {{defeated}} the Spurs, 103–92. But the Mavs started the season with a 6–40 record on their way to finishing 15–67. However, the Mavericks did make a player acquisition that, while it seemed minor at the time, turned out to play a very important role {{in the early years of}} their franchise. Journeyman 6ft 3 in guard Brad Davis, who played for the Anchorage Northern Knights of the Continental Basketball Association, was tracked down and signed by the Mavs in December. At the time, there was absolutely no reason to expect that Davis would be <b>any</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the expansion-level talent the Mavs had. But he started the Mavs' final 26 games, led the team in assists, and his career soared. He spent the next twelve years with the Mavericks, and eventually his number 15 jersey was retired. The Mavericks also marked the first NBA team to have a profitable debut season, with an average of 7,789 spectators.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} Razer Naga had {{a positive}} reception, although many pointed out the obvious targeting towards MMO gamers. Nicholas Deleon on the tech site TechCrunch said the Naga is a good and comfortable mouse. He noted {{that it is not}} <b>any</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> using a keyboard, and how the usefulness of the mouse would depend on how much the user is willing to practice and learn how to use it. Ben Kuchera, of Ars Technica called it a [...] "niche product", stating the buttons were unappealing to people who did not play MMO games. The redesigned version of the Naga, called the Naga Epic Molten, received positive reviews for its design.|$|E

500|$|GameSpot, {{in their}} {{review of the}} game, termed the music [...] "one of the quirkiest and most oddly listenable soundtracks in gaming", and said that it fit {{the mood of the}} game as well as the soundtrack to the first two games.

She also explained Merle Haggard's influence on her career, stating [...] "I had every album he ever put out", and would sing [...] "every song he did", along with her brother, Pake and sister, Susie. In addition, her first major hit, [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] was a remake of Patsy Cline's version of the song, according to McEntire herself.|$|E

Voeckler had also received offers from rival French squads [...] and [...] about joining their respective teams, if in the worst-case scenario that [...] folded.

500|$|The fire on Magstræde at {{the soap}} factory {{was still a}} threat. The fire ate its way along Snaregade.

The houses around it were torn down, and the houses on the {{opposite}} side of the street were blown up with black powder. The outcome was hardly <b>any</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> that of the earlier attempt at the wine cellar, though. The gunpowder went off, people had to run for their lives and the vice mayor's house was set afire and burned to the ground.

500|$|Because of {{the title}} of the Sports Illustrated story that {{compared}} Parker to LeBron James, Mike DeCourcy of Sporting News stated that [...] "Jabari Parker is, rather, the best [...] since Greg Oden." [...] In addition, Parker was considered to have a much less developed physique than James at the same stage of development. [...] CBS Sports' Jeff Borzello also contested the proclamation, pointing out that since James's 2003 class both Dwight Howard (2004) and Oden (2006) were consensus top players in their classes and that Parker might not be <b>any</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the most recent consensus, Oden. [...] In addition, CBS noted that Parker [...] "might not even be the best high school basketball player in the country, given the development of class of 2014's Andrew Wiggins."

[...] IGN.com called it [...] "by-the-books, generic (and at times bland) pop/rock", although it did say Simpson's vocals showed maturity and promise. A writer for Stylus magazine commented that [...] "after spending more than forty minutes with Ashlee, I feel like I don’t know her <b>any</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> I did beforehand... for a record with the name Autobiography, it seems like no bigger criticism could be leveled."

She received nominations in both acting and directing for the film, including the Gotham Award for Best Breakthrough Director, and the Satellite Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture. In his review of the film, critic Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter noted: [...] "Directing debuts by actors don't come <b>any</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> this".
