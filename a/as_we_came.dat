25|$|Dartford {{was one of}} the {{two most}} {{successful}} clubs in England, its only rival being the London Cricket Club. Dartford's prowess is borne out by a 1723 journal entry recorded by the prominent Tory politician Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford: At Dartford upon the Heath (i.e., Dartford Brent) <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> out of the town, the men of Tonbridge and the Dartford men were warmly engaged at the sport of cricket, which of all the people of England the Kentish folk are the most renowned for, and of all the Kentish men, the men of Dartford lay claim to the greatest excellence.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{reaching}} the accident site, investigators from the NTSB found both engines, {{the wings and}} empennage had separated from the fuselage, which had largely been consumed by fire. It was clear to investigators the aircraft had encountered a bird strike upon take-off. One pilot who landed at around the time the Learjet took off told the Gadsden Times, [...] "Just <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> across the runway it was almost black with birds. They swarmed and parted as we went through them." ...|$|E

It is more than likely to have been Dartford Brent where this game was taking place.|$|E

500|$|Oppong's {{performances}} {{helped him}} get an NCAA scholarship into Eastern Kentucky. Idaho, Utah State, Colorado State, and Murray State were some of his other potential Division I destinations. He {{was considered one of}} the top Canadians committing to an NCAA program that year, in a list headlined by Andrew Nicholson and Kris Joseph. As soon as he arrived at EKU, he became close with the school. Oppong said, [...] "From the first day, I was accepted, as soon as I stepped on campus. I was here in the summertime and there were a few guys here who I knew and as soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> in August, I felt like I was part of the family." [...] Head coach Jeff Neubauer commented on him, [...] "We think Papa Oppong will be a tough match-up for our opponents because he is a shooter, rebounder and slasher." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1963 Waldron {{had a major}} {{breakdown}} caused by a heroin overdose. He recounted in 1998 {{that a lot of}} musicians in the 1950s and 1960s felt that taking drugs was necessary for career progression. The police assumed they were all doing it, according to Waldron: The police would stop the musicians and search us <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> out of the clubs after work. We had to turn our pockets inside out. After a while, the musicians thought ... well, if you have the name you might as well have the game. Eventually, I overdosed. I couldn't remember my own name. My hands were trembling, I couldn't play the piano. I needed shock treatments and a spinal tap to bring me back. [...] Waldron always felt that he had to return to playing, but this was a slow process. About a year after the overdose, his physical recovery was sufficient to allow him to start relearning his skills, which he did partly by listening to his own records. His recovery as a musician continued for another two years, as his speed of thought was still too slow over that period to allow genuine improvisation: [...] "I worked out my solos in advance and played what I had written out, until gradually all my faculties returned".|$|E
2500|$|Christmas Day 1657. I went to London {{with my wife}} to {{celebrate}} Christmas Day... Sermon ended, as [...] was giving us the holy sacrament, the chapel was surrounded with soldiers, and all the communicants and assembly surprised and kept prisoners by them, some in the house, others carried away... These wretched miscreants held their muskets against us <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> up to receive the sacred elements, as {{if they would have}} shot us at the altar.|$|E

6000|$|... "People come to {{the prison}} gates and sell it <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> back from work. You can buy {{anything}} except vodka, and you can buy that, though not openly; it gets smuggled in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Two stretchers, Major. Dominique and I {{have been}} making them {{for the last two}} hours. We can leave them here, sir, {{by the side of the}} path, and pick them up <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> along back." ...|$|R
2500|$|McDougall {{reported}} that the final three prahus {{did not attempt to}} escape like the first three had and they fought with determination even after all of the Sarawakian guns were brought to bear on them. One of the prahus was run over just as the second and split in two while the largest and final vessel was destroyed by gunfire and sank with a valuable cargo of gold and jewels. McDougall later said: [...] "The poor captives, who were all made fast below <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> up to engage them, were doubtless glad when our stem opened the sides of their ships, and thus let them out of prison. Few, comparatively, were drowned, being mostly all good swimmers. All those who were not lashed to the vessels, or killed by the Illanuns, escaped. Our decks were soon covered with those we picked up, men of every race and nation in the Archipelago, who had been captured by the pirates in their cruise, which had already lasted seven months." [...] McDougall also confirmed the loss of at least one dead and two wounded while several of the pirates were killed or wounded, most having been hit by cannon and rifle fire. In all at least 100 Sulus became casualties while many others escaped to the shore and retreated into the jungle.|$|E
60|$|There was a cab passing <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> out, and Holmes hailed it.|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] Reuben said, [...] "they {{would only}} shoot us down <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> out. They must guess {{that some of}} us are up at this window, or they would try to carry the horses off, instead of {{destroying}} them.|$|R

60|$|As soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> {{within sight}} of it, we hove the ship to and held a council of war.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> out of {{the club}} there stood two men on the {{sidewalk}} near the steps in earnest conversation.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} right, Mike, {{and we will}} take the main road. They will not be mounted, and I don't think they would stand before a charge of seven men; but they may shoot some of us <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> down upon them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{write for}} them as soon as I find that there is {{something}} for them to do. You are not thinking of running away <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> back I hope, Cyril? You said, when you last wrote, that you were fit for sea again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we must chance that, Hawkins. If {{one does}} come you must {{pick us up}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> along. I agree with you; it does look <b>as</b> if <b>we</b> should have a squall. It may not be {{anything}} very serious, but anyhow, if it comes it will take her along a great deal faster than we can row.|$|R

6000|$|... "Then {{get into}} my gondola, and come along at once," [...] Polani said. [...] "I deeply regret {{the death of the}} captain and sailors. You shall tell me all about it <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> along. <b>We</b> must not delay a moment in {{carrying}} this great news ashore. Have you got the despatches?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{was afraid}} {{we would get}} mixed up in it ourselves. And we was just {{starting}} down the river a-hunting for all the week besides; but <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> back <b>we</b> found out they'd been searching for the body, so then we went and told Brace Dunlap all about it." ...|$|R
