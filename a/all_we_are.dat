5|$|In a final {{gesture of}} love and comprehension, after a {{lifetime}} of despising his father's stories and his father as story-teller, Will finishes the story his father has begun, pulling together the themes, images and characters of his father's storied life to blend reality and fantasy in act of communion and care. By unselfishly releasing the anger he has held about his father's stories, Will gains the understanding that <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> our stories and that his father's stories gave him a reality and substance and a dimension that was as real, genuine, and deep as the day-to-day experiences that Will sought out. Will comes to understand, then, that his father—and the rest of us—are our stories and that the deeper reality of our lives may, in fact, not be our truest self.|$|E

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1915, Noether was invited {{to return to the}} University of Göttingen by David Hilbert and Felix Klein. Their effort to recruit her, however, was blocked by the philologists and historians among the {{philosophical}} faculty: women, they insisted, should not become privatdozent. One faculty member protested: [...] "What will our soldiers think when they return to the university and find that they are required to learn at the feet of a woman?" [...] Hilbert responded with indignation, stating, [...] "I do not see that the sex of the candidate is an argument against her admission as privatdozent.

500|$|Upon release, {{the film}} gained mixed reviews. Sify cited {{that the film}} {{represented}} [...] "something new in the placid world of Tamil cinema", adding that it [...] "broke away from the shackles of the stereotypes". Selvaraghavan also was praised by the reviewer with claims that [...] "the director transports us {{to a whole new}} world {{and at the end of}} it <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> dumb stuck by the visuals, the packaging and the new way of storytelling". Rediff.com gave the film 3.5 out of 5, claiming that viewers should [...] "steel [...] stomach before [...] watch it" [...] and [...] "regardless of the minor discrepancies, AO is definitely a movie to watch". In contrast, Behindwoods.com gave the film 0.5 out of 5 describing the film as [...] "wildly crass", stating that [...] "the underdeveloped script lacks everything – starting from strong plot twists to captive locations to graphics to credibility, above all".|$|E
500|$|James Cameron {{has said}} that he [...] "tried to make a film that would touch people's spirituality across the broad spectrum." [...] He also stated that one of the film's {{philosophical}} underpinnings is that [...] "the Na'vi represent that sort of aspirational part of ourselves that wants to be better, that wants to respect nature, while the humans in the film represent the more venal versions of ourselves, the banality of evil that comes with corporate decisions that are made out of remove of the consequences." [...] Film director John Boorman saw a similar dichotomy as a key factor contributing to its success: [...] "Perhaps the key is the marine in the wheelchair. [...] He is disabled, but Mr Cameron and technology can transport him into the body of a beautiful, athletic, sexual, being. [...] After <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> all disabled in one way or another; inadequate, old, broken, earthbound.

500|$|... "Black Zombie" [...] is an impassioned, self-reflective {{critique}} of problems afflicting the African-American community, including prejudice ("You believe {{when they say}} we ain't shit, we can't grow / <b>All</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> is dope dealers and gangstas and hoes"), economic insolvency ("What do we own? The skin on our backs / We rent and we ask for reparations, then they hit us with tax"), and dependency ("I'ma Colombia record slave / So get paid / Control your own destiny, you are a genius / Don't let it happen to you like it did to me, I was a black zombie"). Its socially conscious lyrics deride media stereotypes of African Americans, inequality in the educational system, and black-on-black violence. According to writer Dax-Devlon Ross, the song foreshadowed the themes and [...] "world view" [...] of Nas' subsequent albums. [...] "Poppa Was a Playa" [...] features uncredited co-production by Kanye West, and discusses Nas' complicated relationship with his father, jazz musician Olu Dara, addressing his lusty, itinerant lifestyle throughout Nas' youth. Gabriel Alvarez of Complex calls it an [...] "honest dedication to his old man: a jazz player, a rolling stone" [...] and writes of the song, [...] "The love is there despite the man's faults. Nas crafts a full picture of the past, looking at the infidelity and fights from both parents' perspectives." ...|$|E

Samaras then started the next match against Motherwell in the SPL {{and set up}} another goal for Anthony Stokes, Celtic {{went on to win}} the match 2–1 after being 1–0 down. Samaras went on to score his first goal of the 2011–12 season in a 5–0 win over St Mirren. Manager Neil Lennon said that; [...] "He got his goal, which we've been waiting on a long time. His play was fantastic. He is a talent and <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> asking for is consistency. He has shown everyone today what he is capable of when he is in full flow. The rest took a leaf from his book." [...] After an impressive performance in Celtic's 1–1 draw against Italian league leaders Udinese, fellow Serie A side Palermo expressed an interest in Samaras. He had been playing as a left midfielder in the previous few weeks, and the Daily Record said that his good form since returning to the team had helped re-ignite Celtic's season. On 24 December, Samaras started as a striker and scored twice as Celtic beat Kilmarnock 2–1.|$|E

[...] A Buddhist would say, ‘Why the big fuss about abortion and euthanasia? After <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> all reincarnated {{over and over again in}} many lives, so why the big deal about ending one?’ These beliefs are incompatible with Christian principles, and those Christian principles are or have been the governing principles of American society.
