40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a desire by vehicle {{manufacturers}} to reduce the in-cab noise of vehicles, in order to improve driver comfort and enhance the enjoyment of in-vehicle entertainment systems. This reduction of incab noise is accompanied by policy initiatives to reduce transport related noise by implementing low noise road surfaces. However, it is not known how such reductions in the availability of auditory cues affect drivers’ ability to judge speed, and there is a danger that drivers will increase their speed, to compensate for the absence of auditory cues. In this study, drivers were required to maintain speed at 30 and 70 mph, {{in the absence of a}} speedometer, with and without <b>accompanying</b> <b>vehicle</b> noise. Results showed that drivers’ ability to maintain the correct speed profile was much more variable in the absence of <b>accompanying</b> <b>vehicle</b> noise and this variation was found to be higher when drivers were asked to travel at higher speeds of 70 mph. Drivers were also found to travel faster than the required speed in the absence of vehicle noise, although their ability to maintain speed was generally worse at 70 mph, even in the presence of auditory cues...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} a {{key difference}} between two promotional <b>vehicles,</b> <b>coupons</b> and rebates. Whereas coupons offer deals up front, with {{the purchase of}} the product, rebates can be redeemed only after purchase. When consumers experience uncertain redemption costs, this difference translates to a difference in when uncertainty is resolved. With coupons the uncertainty is resolved before purchase; with rebates the uncertainty is resolved after purchase. As a result, we show that rebates are more efficient in surplus extraction but coupons offer more finetuned control over whom to serve. We identify the conditions under which each is optimal, and these conditions turn on the gap between “low” reservation price consumers' valuations and their highest redemption costs. Rebates are optimal when this gap is large; coupons tend to be optimal otherwise. Risk aversity on the part of consumers reduces the attractiveness of rebates, as does the delay between rebate redemption and rebate payment, but the latter if and only if consumers are more impatient than the seller. These observations match up well with {{what we know about the}} use of these promotional vehicles in the real world. coupons, rebates, promotion, price discrimination...|$|R

The 2009 festival saw changes to the campervan fields; commercial vehicles were no longer classed as 'campervans', all campervans had to have a fitted sleeping area and either washing or cooking facilities, and caravans and trailer tents were allowed back at the festival. Prior to this only campervans were allowed on site, caravans and trailers being banned in the early 1990s after a number were stuck in the mud and abandoned.|$|R

Its end-of-life recovery is lever in overcoming technical challenges towards electromobility deployment, such as battery cost, environmental impact, the availability of constituent materials and the mandatory recycling rate. In this chapter, we focus on economic aspects, {{in order to assess}} the end-of-life recovery impact: we analyze the end-of-life cost evolution of lithium-ion batteries to determine whether it will be a source of cost or profit for car manufacturers. We define and analyze two recovery options: on the one hand, simply recycling which is mandatory by regulation and, on the other hand, repurposing for reuse in many second life applications (from residence related applications to energy storage and grid stabilization). To account for the complexity and the long-term horizon of our study (2030), we combine the use of System Dynamics with the Stanford Research Institute Matrix for building scenarios that mix relevant factors such as the electric vehicle market and the proportion of repurposing for reuse. Finally we show that repurposing could lower the battery’s initial cost—under certain conditions regarding the future battery price and the repurposing cost—where recycling might increase it...|$|R

To overcome these barriers possible market mechanisms are suggested, i. e. the incentive of members of the transport system to create an organization chart of the utilization market. At this stage, a cluster scheme may be offered under which one the control and the responsibility belong to the automaker. This would allow reducing the cost of creating the infrastructure for the recycling system. Were formulated the possible positive effects for each of the participants of transport system.
