40|$|Mass {{injection}} upstream of {{the tip of}} {{a high-speed}} <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> <b>rotor</b> is a stability enhancement approach known to be effective in suppressing small in tip-critical rotors. This process is examined in a transonic <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> <b>rotor</b> through experiments and time-averaged Navier-Stokes CFD simulations. Measurements and simulations for discrete injection are presented for a range of injection rates and distributions of injectors around the annulus. The simulations indicate that tip injection increases stability by unloading the rotor tip and that increasing injection velocity improves the effectiveness of tip injection. For the tested rotor, experimental results demonstrate that at 70 percent speed the stalling flow coefficient can be reduced by 30 percent using an injected mass- flow equivalent to 1 percent of the annulus flow. At design speed, the stalling flow coefficient was reduced by 6 percent using an injected mass-fiow equivalent to 2 percent of the annulus flow. The experiments show that stability enhancement is related to the mass-averaged axial velocity at the tip. For a given injected mass-flow, the mass-averaged axial velocity at the tip is increased by injecting flow over discrete portions of the circumference as opposed to full-annular injection. The implications of these results on the design of recirculating casing treatments and other methods to enhance stability will be discussed...|$|E

40|$|Clearance leakage {{losses of}} <b>axial</b> <b>{{compressor}}</b> <b>rotors</b> and stators {{have a major}} impact on the overall compressor performance. The clearance heights in the last stages (high pressure stages) of a gas turbine compressor are very large in comparison to the low pressure stages due to mechanical constraints and small blade heights.

Starting over with a 3 DOptimization of the mentioned rotor casing the work additionally refers to the aerodynamic effects and the off design performance of the optimized geometry.

40|$|The tip {{clearance}} flow of industrial <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> <b>rotors</b> {{has a significant}} impact on compressor performance. Most {{tip clearance}} flow research work has been undertaken in the earlier low-pressure transonic stages of compressors. The main differences between the earlier (low-pressure) and later (high-pressure) stages include blade profile, stagger angle, Mach number, blade length and tip clearance. The tip clearance in the later stages of an industrial <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> is relatively large due to mechanical constraints and short blading. The stagger angle is much lower and so the tip clearance flow is at a higher angle to the (negative) axial direction. In the present work, a computational method has been employed to investigate tip clearance flow from 1 % span to 10 % span for blading such as that found in the later stages. A pinch tip model is used to model the blade tip in a cascade with a stationary and moving end-wall. It has been found that the tip clearance flow rolls up into a vortex much later than in the earlier stages. The migration of the tip clearance vortex across the passage is much less than for the earlier stages and also the induced vortex is much weaker. Comparisons between a cascade with fixed and moving end-walls are made, the main difference being that the tip clearance flow is stronger with a moving end-wall. The 1 % tip clearance flow structure with stationary end-wall is shown to be different from all other cases investigated...|$|R

A comparison between the two flow deviations is made to assess {{the development of a}} passage vortex due to the distortion of the inlet flow.

Rig tests of a low speed research compressor rotor with 3 % tip clearance provided characteristics plots for validation of the CFD results. With increase in clearance from 1 % to 4 %, the rotor pressure rise at the design point was observed to decrease linearly.

Results show that the circumferential groove casing treatment can expand the operating range of the <b>compressor</b> <b>rotor</b> either with or without inlet pressure distortion {{at the expense of}} a drop in peak isentropic efficiency. The casing treatment is capable of weakening or even removing the tip leakage vortex effectively either with or without inlet distortion. In clean inlet circumstances, the enhancement and forward movement of tip leakage vortex cause the untreated <b>compressor</b> <b>rotor</b> to stall. By contrast, with circumferential groove casing, the serious flow separation on the suction surface leads to aerodynamic stalling eventually. In the presence of inlet pressure distortion, the blade loading changes from passage to passage as the distorted inflow sector is traversed. Similar to the clean inlet circumstances, with a smooth wall casing, the enhancement and forward movement of tip leakage vortex are still the main factors which lead to the <b>compressor</b> <b>rotor</b> stalling eventually. When the rotor works under near stall conditions, the blockage resulting from the tip leakage vortex in all the passages is very serious. Especially in several passages, flow-spillage is observed.
