40|$|We {{introduce}} numerical {{methods for}} simulating the diffusive motion of rigid bodies of arbitrary shape {{immersed in a}} viscous fluid. We parameterize {{the orientation of the}} bodies using normalized quaternions, which are numerically robust, space efficient, and easy to accumulate. We construct a system of overdamped Langevin equations in the quaternion representation that accounts for hydrodynamic effects, preserves the unit-norm constraint on the quaternion, and is time reversible with respect to the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution at equilibrium. We introduce two schemes for temporal integration of the overdamped Langevin equations of motion, one based on the Fixman midpoint method and the other based on a random finite difference approach, both of which ensure the correct stochastic drift term is captured in a computationally efficient way. We study several examples of rigid colloidal particles diffusing near a no-slip boundary, and demonstrate the importance of the choice of tracking point on the measured translational mean square displacement (MSD). We examine the average short-time as well as the long-time quasi-two-dimensional diffusion coefficient of a rigid particle sedimented near <b>a</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>wall</b> due to gravity. For several particle shapes we find a choice of tracking point that makes the MSD essentially linear with time, allowing us to estimate the long-time diffusion coefficient efficiently using a Monte Carlo method. However, in general such a special choice of tracking point does not exist, and numerical techniques for simulating long trajectories, such as the ones we introduce here, are necessary to study diffusion on long timescales.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{methods for}} large scale Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulation of many rigid particles of arbitrary shape suspended in a fluctuating fluid. Our method adds Brownian motion to the rigid multiblob method {{at a cost}} comparable {{to the cost of}} deterministic simulations. We demonstrate that we can efficiently generate deterministic and random displacements for many particles using preconditioned Krylov iterative methods, if kernel methods to efficiently compute the action of the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) mobility matrix and it "square" root are available for the given boundary conditions. We address a major challenge in large-scale BD simulations, capturing the stochastic drift term that arises because of the configuration-dependent mobility. Unlike the widely-used Fixman midpoint scheme, our methods utilize random finite differences and do not require the solution of resistance problems or the computation of the action of the inverse square root of the RPY mobility matrix. We construct two temporal schemes which are viable for large scale simulations, an Euler-Maruyama traction scheme and a Trapezoidal Slip scheme, which minimize the number of mobility solves per time step while capturing the required stochastic drift terms. We validate and compare these schemes numerically by modeling suspensions of boomerang shaped particles sedimented near <b>a</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>wall.</b> Using the trapezoidal scheme, we investigate the steady-state active motion in a dense suspensions of confined microrollers, whose height above the wall is set by a combination of thermal noise and active flows.
