Despite numerous cytogenetic studies, {{little is known about}} nucleolar dominance at the level of rRNA gene expression in plants. We used S 1 nuclease protection and primer extension assays to define nucleolar dominance at a molecular level in the plant genus Brassica. rRNA transcription start sites were mapped in three diploids and in three allotetraploids (<b>amphidiploids)</b> and one allohexaploid species derived from these diploid progenitors. rRNA transcripts of only one progenitor were detected in vegetative tissues of each polyploid.

The hypothesis that nucleolar dominance in plants is correlated with physical characteristics of rRNA gene intergenic spacers is not supported in Brassica. Furthermore, in Brassica napus, rRNA genes silenced in vegetative tissues were found to be expressed in all floral organs, including sepals and petals, arguing against the hypothesis that passage through meiosis is needed to reactivate suppressed genes.

FAE 1 gene is a rate-limiting gene for erucic acid synthesis in Brassica. The genes from six Brassica species of U-triangule were cloned by PCR.

The utilization of wild germplasm in breeding programs has been restricted by reproductive barriers between wild and cultivated species and technical difficulties in making large numbers of crosses.

With an objective to improve foliar disease resistance, the primary gene pool was diversified by introgressing foliar disease resistance in five cultivated genotypes (ICGV 91114, ICGS 76, ICGV 91278, JL 24, and DH 86) from synthetic <b>amphidiploids</b> using a backcross breeding approach.
