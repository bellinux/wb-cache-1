30|$|This {{can be a}} {{very useful}} feature when {{there is more than one}} {{reciprocal}} lattice in the <b>amplitude</b> <b>map</b> of the discrete Fourier transform of an image. This kind of a situation would arise when an image contains information from more than one crystal. If one of two crystals occupied a much larger area in the image than the other crystal, e.g. there was some small crystalline inclusion in a crystalline matrix, there would indeed be two sets of Fourier coefficients with significantly different intensities in the <b>amplitude</b> <b>map</b> of the discrete Fourier transform of that image.|$|E
30|$|Informed by our {{previous}} {{work with the}} CRISP program [13], we utilized the manual reciprocal basis vector assignment option whenever the automatically (by default) assigned reciprocal lattice in the dFT <b>amplitude</b> <b>map</b> was obviously incorrect by visual inspection. This could, for example, {{be due to a}} translational pseudo-symmetry of the first or special kind. Similarly, we also made inferences from the visual inspection of the apparent point symmetry in the <b>amplitude</b> <b>map</b> of the dFT, i.e., the apparent Laue class, of an image concerning the possible existence of a motif-based pseudo-symmetry of the first kind or of a metric specialization that {{has been turned into a}} translational pseudo-symmetry of the special kind by noise in that image.|$|E

40|$|Quantum {{coherence}} is proclaimed {{to promote}} efficient energy collection by light-harvesting complexes and prototype organic photovoltaics. However, supporting spectroscopic studies are hindered by {{the problem of}} distinguishing between the excited state and ground state origin of coherent spectral transients. Coherence <b>amplitude</b> <b>maps,</b> which systematically represent quantum beats observable in two-dimensional (2 D) spectroscopy, are currently the prevalent tool for making this distinction. In this article, we present coherence <b>amplitude</b> <b>maps</b> of a molecular dimer, which have become significantly distorted {{as a result of}} the finite laser bandwidth used to record the 2 D spectra. We argue that under standard spectroscopic conditions similar distortions are to be expected for compounds absorbing over a spectral range similar to, or exceeding, that of the dimer. These include virtually all photovoltaic polymers and certain photosynthetic complexes. With the distortion of coherence <b>amplitude</b> <b>maps,</b> alternative ways to identify quantum coherence are called for. Here, we use numerical simulations that reproduce the essential photophysics of the dimer to unambiguously determine the excited state origin of prominent quantum beats observed in the 2 D spectral measurements. This approach is proposed as a dependable method for coherence identification...|$|R
30|$|All Laue {{classes in}} 2 D contain twofold {{rotation}} points just as all Laue classes in 3 D contain inversion centers. The point symmetries of the <b>amplitude</b> <b>maps</b> of discrete Fourier transforms display Laue classes of {{more or less}} 2 D periodic images in reciprocal space.|$|R
30|$|For the {{detection}} of pseudo-symmetries {{of the first and}} special kind, the user benefits greatly when a computer program displays the <b>amplitude</b> <b>map</b> of the discrete Fourier transform of a more or less 2 D-periodic image. This is because the dFT <b>amplitude</b> <b>map</b> displays the Laue class that corresponds to the underlying plane symmetry group. When there is no pseudo-symmetry of the first or special kind (and there is no metric specialization), there is also no obvious mismatch between (or detachment of) the visible point symmetry around the center of this map and the translation symmetry that is governed by the metrical properties of the extracted lattice parameters. While the CRISP and CrysTBox programs both possess such a feature, it is absent in the PUCE program as the latter works in direct space exclusively.|$|E
30|$|These {{kinds of}} {{classification}} schemes should ideally {{be a combination}} of the translation and site 4 symmetry parts of plane symmetries and based on G-AICs [7, 16 – 18] in order to avoid arbitrarily set thresholds. This is because threshold-free translation symmetry classifications can be based solely on the maximal likelihood position of a few Fourier coefficients (FCs) in the <b>amplitude</b> <b>map</b> of the discrete Fourier transform (dFT) of a more or less 2 D-periodic image [17]. Threshold-free classifications of plane symmetries require, on the other hand, the knowledge of the intensity values of all pixels (in real space) [30] or of the amplitudes and phase angles of all FCs of such images (in reciprocal space) [18], but not the FC positions in the dFT <b>amplitude</b> <b>map.</b> It is the combination of these two kinds of information that leads to the plane symmetries that need to be classified.|$|E
30|$|The maximum <b>{{amplitude}}</b> <b>map</b> PSc (Fig.  9 a) has ±  12  ms as time window. This maximum <b>amplitude</b> <b>map</b> shows amplitude anomalies {{that match}} with the fluid {{content of the}} wells. In the highlighted red zone, the high-amplitude anomalies correctly match with the oil-filled wells. The black arrows show areas of very high anomalies which {{might be due to}} the presence of gas. The highlighted yellow zones illustrate low-amplitude anomalies that do not match with the wells fluid content. Along the isochrone lines 1250 and 1370  ms, a clear conformity termination of high-amplitude is observed and drastic anomaly changes are seen (to lower amplitudes). These changes are caused by the change in fluid type from gas to oil and to water. Such conformities increase the certainty of the interpretation. These fluids are well arranged as in a conventional reservoir with oil at lower isochrones and water at higher isochrones values.|$|E

30|$|Results {{that were}} {{obtained}} with a non-default {{setting of the}} CRISP program (e.g., mainly one extra click with the computer mouse to select the largest possible circular area of the image for subsequent processing), are listed separately in Tables  4 and 6. In these two tables, there are also results from the CrysTBox program that were re-interpreted/re-calculated. (As mentioned above in the “Particulars of the employed lattice parameter extraction procedures” section, such re-interpretations and re-calculations were indicated as being necessary after inspections of the <b>amplitude</b> <b>maps</b> of the dFTs of the corresponding test images.) While both sets of tables have the same general outlay, there are only results from CrysTBox and CRISP in Tables  4 and 6 since the PUCE program possesses only one (default) setting and does not provide <b>amplitude</b> <b>maps</b> of the dFTs of the test images on which one could base re-interpretations and re-calculations.|$|R

40|$|Study of {{a mature}} {{petroleum}} {{play in the}} Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) indicates that the spatial distribution of petroleum accumulations exhibits a self-affinity characteristic. This characteristic motivated the examination of a fractal model for a quantitative description of petroleum resource spatial distribution. The proposed approach transforms the spatial information with respect to discovered petroleum accumulations into a frequency domain, represented by an <b>amplitude</b> <b>map</b> and a phase spectrum. The <b>amplitude</b> <b>map</b> is then calibrated using a fractal model, inferred from exploration data, {{to account for the}} sampling bias in exploration procedure. The information in the obtained phase spectrum provides no clue with respect to the locations of undiscovered accumulations, and cannot be enhanced by the established fractal model either. If the calibrated <b>amplitude</b> <b>map</b> and a random phase map are transformed back to the spatial domain and conditioned on the discovered petroleum accumulations, the resulting map is equivalent to one of equal-probable realisations from a conditional simulation. Improvement can be made by extracting information with respect to locations of undiscovered petroleum deposits from geological factors controlling the formation of petroleum accumulations in a petroleum system. Using additional quantitative models, such as a geological favorability map or a map of probability of petroleum occurrence, allows an improved characterisation of spatial distribution of petroleum accumulations by the fractal model. An example from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin illustrates the application of the method...|$|E
30|$|Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM) is a {{spectroscopy}} fluorescence {{technique that}} can measure {{the speed of}} decay in the fluorescence emitted by the surfaces under examination [20]. It provides the fluorescence <b>amplitude</b> <b>map</b> and the lifetime map of a surface of interest after excitation with very short UV pulses. The <b>amplitude</b> <b>map</b> is mainly correlated {{with the amount of}} fluorescent materials present on the surfaces, while the lifetime map indicates areas characterized by the presence of different fluorescent compounds, since any material usually exhibits a specific and characteristic fluorescence lifetime. The measurement allows for a more precise differentiation of various substances that may appear similar under UV illumination. The apparatus employs a Nitrogen pulsed laser (λ[*]=[*] 337  nm) and a nanosecond time-gated intensified camera for recording the temporal decay of fluorescence. It can examine an area of about 25  cm diameter and can produce a colour-coded map of the fluorescence emission, measured in nanoseconds (ns). UV fluorescence imaging and FLIM techniques were carried out on six statues.|$|E
40|$|We study codimension- 2 bifurcations {{of fixed}} points of {{dissipative}} diffeomorphisms {{with a pair}} of complex critical eigenvalues together with either an eigenvalue − 1 or another such a pair. In the previous studies only cubic normal forms were considered. However, in some cases the unfolding requires higher order terms and these are investigated here. We (re) derive the normal forms and reduce them to a single <b>amplitude</b> <b>map.</b> This map is similar to the amplitude system for the double-Hopf bifurcation for vector fields. We show how the critical normal form coefficients determine the general bifurcation picture for this <b>amplitude</b> <b>map.</b> Generic nonsymmetric perturbations of the normal forms are considered. Our case studies show a detailed picture near various bifurcation curves, which was somewhat richer than the theoretical predictions. For arbitrary maps with these bifurcations we give explicit formulas for critical normal form coefficients on center manifolds and apply them to two examples. Here we are able to demonstrate the existence of the bubble-structure, which was only observed in unfolded normal forms before...|$|E
30|$|With seven red {{and three}} blue {{markings}} in Tables  3 and 5, the CrysTBox program {{does not seem}} to perform well at first sight when the quantitative outputs of the program are not re-interpreted/re-calculated {{on the basis of the}} <b>amplitude</b> <b>maps</b> of the dFTs of the images.

30|$|The {{corresponding}} {{entries for}} these three images as extracted by the CrysTBox program in Table  5 need, therefore to be multiplied by five {{in order to}} be listed in Table  6.

30|$|Armed {{with this}} insight, {{we note that}} the unit cell areas for images # 1 to # 3 that were derived {{on the basis of}} the {{extraction}} results of the CrysTBox program are very different from those that were derived {{on the basis of the}} extraction results of both the CRISP and the PUCE programs, see Table  5. We conclude, therefore, that the lattice parameters that the CrysTBox program extracted for the images that possess an oblique Bravais lattice per design (# 1 to # 3) are all in need of a re-interpretation, although they are at least consistent within this set of test images. The inspection of the <b>amplitude</b> <b>maps</b> of the dFTs of images # 1 to # 3 and of the corresponding maps of the other four images (# 6 to # 9) for which entries in red ink exist for the CrysTBox program in Tables  3 and 5 revealed that the reciprocal lattice assignment was not based on the two shortest reciprocal lattice vectors in the <b>amplitude</b> <b>maps.</b>|$|R

The high-amplitude {{anomalies}} {{responses in the}} red highlighted areas are seen to match with their corresponding oil-filled wells, while the gas wells YZ 01 and YZ 3 D in the yellow highlighted areas do not match with their corresponding amplitude responses. The faulty nature of the reservoir affects arrangement of the fluids as in a conventional reservoir (gas–oil–water).|$|E
30|$|With the CrysTBox program [21], one has {{at least}} visual access to the dFT <b>amplitude</b> <b>map</b> of more or less 2 D-periodic images so that one may notice when the point {{symmetry}} of this map (i.e., its Laue class) is in qualitative disagreement with the translation symmetry type that one would infer from of the extracted lattice parameters and their error bars.

30|$|Besides {{the fact}} that all three {{computer}} programs/algorithms aimed at an intrinsically impossible task [7, 16] in a real-world application when they extracted 2 D-lattice parameters from the same sets of synthetic test images, one would naively expect that they still provide similar results in their default settings and without a re-interpretation/re-calculation that is indicated to be necessary by a program’s output such as the <b>amplitude</b> <b>map</b> of the dFT of an image. As Tables  3 and 5 show, this is often not the case.|$|E
40|$|The {{probability}} density function (PDF) {{approach has been}} shown to be a useful tool in turbulence research. The systematic approach for determining PDFs is by means of solving the transport equations for PDFs. In the PDF equations for turbulent scalar elds, conditional dissipation rate (CDR) appears as the only unclosed term (Pope (1985)). Recently developed large-eddy simulation schemes for turbulent reactive flow, such as the ltered PDF approach (Colucci, et al. (1998)), the conditional moment closure (Bushe & Steiner (1999)), and the Lagrangian flamelet model (Pitsch & Steiner (2000)), also require models for the CDR. No satisfactory closure model for CDR had been constructed until the mapping closure approach (Kraichnan (1989), Chen, et al. (1989)) was formulated. <b>Amplitude</b> <b>mapping</b> closure suggests a CDR model (O’Brien & Jiang (1991)) whose form is separable in scalar and time variables.

These positions are directly related to the reciprocal and direct lattice parameters of a 2 D periodic image, and thereby to the shape of the 2 D primitive unit cell (or sub-unit cell in case of the rectangular centered 2 D Bravais lattice in direct space).|$|E
30|$|Since we {{saw from}} the <b>amplitude</b> <b>map</b> of the dFT {{of an image}} which {{reciprocal}} lattice spots had been selected as the reciprocal basis vectors by the CrysTBox program, we made re-interpretations and re-calculations of the corresponding direct space lattice parameters and the derived unit cell areas.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the double Neimark–Sacker bifurcation occurring in a two-DoF system, subject to PD digital position control. In the model the control force is considered piecewise constant. Introducing a nonlinearity {{related to the}} saturation of the control force, the bifurcations occurring in the system are analyzed. The system is generally losing stability through Neimark–Sacker bifurcations, with relatively simple dynamics. However, the interaction of two different Neimark–Sacker bifurcations steers the system to much more complicated behavior. Our analysis is carried out using the method proposed by Kuznetsov and Meijer. It consists of reducing {{the dynamics of the}} nonlinear map to its local center manifold, eliminating the non-internally resonant nonlinear terms and transforming the nonlinear map to an <b>amplitude</b> <b>map,</b> that describes the local dynamics of the system. The analysis of this <b>amplitude</b> <b>map</b> allows us to define regions, in the space of the control gains, with a close interaction of the two bifurcations, which generates unstable quasiperiodic motion on a 3 -torus, coexisting with two stable 2 -torus quasiperiodic motions. Other regions inthe space of the control gains show the coexistenceof 2 -torus quasiperiodic solutions, one stable and the other unstable.
