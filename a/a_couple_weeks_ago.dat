500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "I Will Be" [...] {{was shot in}} New York City on 18 December 2008, and {{features}} Gossip Girl actor Chace Crawford {{as one of the}} characters. A reporter for People explained how the inclusion of Crawford in the video came to fruition, writing that [...] "Chace went to London a couple months ago for meetings and to promote Gossip Girl. He went to a party and ended up meeting Leona. [...] hit it off and talk {{every once in a while}} and have become fast friends. <b>A</b> <b>couple</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> Leona called Chace and asked if he would be in her next video. He obviously said yes." [...] In the video, it is presumed that Lewis and Crawford have stolen a large amount of money, as it opens with dialogue between the pair and how they are going to try and arrange to meet each other at a later date, due to the police closing in on them. As the song begins to play, Lewis sings the first verse on the car bonnet in which they were shown sitting in previously. As she sings the first chorus, she stands up and faces Crawford in the car, and begins to walk away in a car park as she sings the second verse. For the second chorus, Lewis is shown to evade the police by trying to escape by car park stairways, but is confronted by policemen in most directions she goes. For the final chorus, Lewis makes it out onto the road and runs from the police in their cars, but is ultimately blocked from escape in all directions as they close in on her, arrest her, and place her in the back of a police car. People ranked the video as one of the most anticipated videos to be released in January 2009.|$|E

50|$|The Bucs playoff hopes took hits after {{a second}} loss in a row, this time to the New Orleans Saints. Their defense was shaky, as they allowed 13 {{points in the first}} half of the game, and 18 points in the second half. This put the Bucs outside the playoff picture, and left them {{requiring}} victory in week 17 as well as hoping for the Washington Redskins and the Green Bay Packers to both lose. Mark Ingram scored two touchdowns, during the game, and Jameis Winston was picked off twice during the game, unlike the previous meeting of the two teams <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Early in the {{development}} of the project, Dustin Kensrue posted the following update on the band's studio journal site:"We sat down <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> and made a rough timeline so that we wouldn’t find ourselves putting this out next winter instead of late spring/early summer. The plan is to record at least 75% of each disc at a time, and then have time to come back and re-evaluate, start mixing, and tie up any loose ends. Right now we have done a large amount of the Air disc and have just started up on Earth, which we’ve given ourselves only to the end of next week since we want it to have a pretty stripped down vibe and we don’t want to have time to over- think it. We moved the recording gear into an empty living room with hardwood floors and are recording the whole earth disc in here which is sounding very cool." ...|$|E
5000|$|We {{were in our}} {{rehearsal}} {{room and}} Robert and Dean were playing acoustic guitar with each other, playing this line, and Eric grabbed a couple microphones and started tapping {{in some kind of}} rhythmic pattern. It was coming through the monitor, and there was a single Indian drum made out of stretched leather, and we just started a little interplay between us. We recorded onto cassette tape, I took it home, and the melody came into my head for the verse, and it became a song. It's a special song, personally, one of those songs you write because of some form of defense mechanism that's subconscious. I wrote it third person and I only realized <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> when I finally listened to the whole album that it was actually an introspective thing. It's easier to write in an allegorical sense third-person when it's something you have a hard time looking at. It's probably one of my favorite songs on the album. I {{think people are going to}} either love it or hate it.|$|E
5000|$|Mendler {{said that}} is {{influenced}} by British neo-soul and listed Ellie Goulding, Florence and the Machine, Marina Diamandis, and Lianne La Havas as her biggest British influences. She has mentioned Natasha Bedingfield, Broken Bells, Mark Ronson and Amy Winehouse. In 2013 Mendler revealed {{to have a big}} admiration for the Adele's musical style. To Disney Channel UK she said that [...] "admire the career of Adele, because she has her own musical style. She does things her way and writes about things she is passionate about. It is really working out well for her". She was also influenced by Canadian artists Feist and Tegan and Sara. To Hartford Courant she commented: [...] "I've been a fan of Tegan and Sara's for awhile. They just do what they want to do. They don't follow trends". She covered the song [...] "I Was a Fool" [...] by the duo and released with the message: [...] "I heard this song by Tegan and Sara <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> and couldn't stop singing it, so I just had to do my own version". In 2014, she mentioned in an interview to CKQK-FM Canadian artists Nelly Furtado, Joni Mitchell and European bands Coldplay and Little Dragon as influences in composing her second album.|$|E

5000|$|The Norwood Football Club {{entered the}} 1997 SANFL season with purpose and rage that {{would see it}} {{dominate}} the years competition. During the home and away season the club lost only three games during the minor round with a percentage of 64.82%, second to only that of Port Adelaide's 1914 season percentage of 68.78%. The dominance of Norwood during this year was highlighted on ANZAC day when Norwood played the second placed team of the year, Port Adelaide, winning by 122 points. However, during the second semi-final Norwood lost to Port Adelaide. The loss {{proved to be a}} wake up call for a side seemingly winning with ease. The following week a win over Central District saw them make the Grand Final, where again they would play Port Adelaide, this time in front of 44,161 eager spectators. Norwood were no longer complacent like they had been <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> and dished out Port Adelaide's greatest ever grand final defeat in the SANFL winning by 73 points, 19.12 (126) to 7.11 (53). With midfielders Anthony Harvey (Jack Oatey Medallist), John Cunningham and Andrew Jarman playing superbly, the Redlegs had their Magpie opponents chasing shadows all afternoon. Norwood's victory, which came during the same season Port Adelaide's controversial bid to enter the AFL came to fruition, meant the satisfaction it generated amongst Redleg supporters was euphoric.|$|E

40|$|This {{is a rich}} {{paper to}} discuss with {{numerous}} exciting ideas. It touches upon areas ranging from the questioning of the traditional application of rational expectations in macro modelling, the role of disagreement in expectations for asset price determination and implications of the new thinking on modelling expectations for monetary policy. The paper also presents {{a view of the}} history of the Phillips curve and discusses the determination of inflation without a Phillips curve. The Phillips curve was at the centre of a related paper (Sims, 2008), which Chris presented <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b> at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s 53 rd economic conference. Given that I had the chance to talk about that paper at that conference, today I will focus on some of the other ideas. Chris starts his paper by recalling that in earlier work he had criticised central bank macro modellers for not following the rational expectations literature to the letter, for example, in jointly specifying and estimating the system of equations in their models (Sims, 2002). I would like to express my relief that the modellers did not take on board Chris ’ suggestions to put all of the cross equation restrictions in place at that time. In light of the central argument in this paper, this would have been a terrible idea. Indeed...|$|E
