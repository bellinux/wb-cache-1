5|$|Horizontal {{broaching}} machines {{are designed for}} pull broaching, surface broaching, continuous broaching, and rotary broaching. Pull style machines are basically vertical machines laid on the side with a longer stroke. Surface style machines hold the broach stationary while the workpieces are clamped into fixtures that are mounted on <b>a</b> <b>conveyor</b> system. Continuous style machines {{are similar to the}} surface style machines except adapted for internal broaching.|$|E
50|$|In {{internal}} logistics, {{there are}} various ways for getting product flows up or down. A solution which is often used is the deployment of incline or lowering belts. When placed at an angle in order to bridge a height difference, such belt conveyors also {{have the advantage of}} covering a certain distance. A disadvantage is the loss of much useful floor space {{as a result of the}} presence of the necessary supports for the belt <b>conveyor.</b> <b>A</b> bigger distance over a smaller floor area can be bridged using a product lift or <b>a</b> vertical <b>conveyor.</b> <b>A</b> continuous <b>conveyor</b> or <b>a</b> discontinuous <b>conveyor</b> can be chosen as <b>a</b> vertical <b>conveyor.</b> Continuous conveyors can take the form of <b>a</b> spiral <b>conveyor,</b> <b>an</b> L-shaped <b>conveyor</b> or platform lift or a product lift fitted with a fork.|$|R

50|$|Just like spiral <b>conveyors</b> also <b>a</b> {{vertical}} <b>conveyor</b> {{that use}} forks {{are able to}} transport material loads in a continuous flow. With these forks the load can be taken from one horizontal conveyor and put down on another horizontal <b>conveyor</b> on <b>a</b> different level. By adding more forks more products can be lifted at the same time. Conventional vertical conveyors have the restriction that the input and output of material loads must have the same direction. By using forks many combinations of different input- and output levels in different directions are possible. <b>A</b> vertical <b>conveyor</b> with forks can even {{be used as a}} vertical sorter. Compared to <b>a</b> spiral <b>conveyor</b> <b>a</b> vertical <b>conveyor</b> - with or without forks - takes up less space.|$|R
5|$|The jetty {{facilities}} used two cranes to offload coal, {{with the capacity}} of unloading two ships at one time, {{at a rate of}} 480 tonnes an hour. Coal was also delivered by rail to the east of the station using the Brighton Main Line which passes near the site. Coal was usually delivered to the jetty, rather than by rail. <b>A</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt system was then used to take coal to the coal storage area or directly to the station's boiler rooms. The conveyor belt system consisted of a series of bridges connected by towers. The coal storage area was a large concrete box capable of holding 75,000 tonnes of coal. This had an overhead gantry with <b>a</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt attached to the conveyor belt system, for taking coal from the coal store to the boiler rooms.|$|E
5|$|Shark {{teeth are}} {{embedded}} in the gums rather than directly affixed to the jaw, and are constantly replaced throughout life. Multiple rows of replacement teeth grow in a groove {{on the inside of}} the jaw and steadily move forward in comparison to <b>a</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt; some sharks lose 30,000 or more teeth in their lifetime. The rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months. In most species, teeth are replaced one at a time as opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row, which is observed in the cookiecutter shark.|$|E
5|$|The Human Resources and Research and Development {{buildings}} were originally constructed around 1912 by the MacKay Copper Process Company. The property was acquired in 1923 by the Thermos Company following the foreclosure of the MacKay company. The Human Resources building {{was used by}} the enameling department until its conversion in 1948. The Research and Development building was previously the Engineering building. A one-story hipped frame gatehouse was constructed in the 1920s. The Carpenter Shop (Building 62) was constructed in 1926. The Thermos factory completed construction of a storage building in 1929 (Building 2) and another storage building in 1941 (Building 1). Glass House 1 (Building 5) was constructed in 1939 and incorporates a warehouse dating from 1930 into its construction. Glass House 2 was constructed in 1951 and is connected to the Manufacturing Building by <b>a</b> <b>conveyor.</b>|$|E

5|$|Polar front {{theory is}} {{attributed}} to Jacob Bjerknes, and was derived from a coastal network of observation sites in Norway during World War I. This theory proposed that the main inflow into a cyclone was concentrated along two lines of convergence, one ahead (or east) of the low and another trailing equatorward (south in the Northern Hemisphere and north in the Southern Hemisphere) and behind (or west) of the low. The convergence line ahead of the low became known as either the steering line or the warm front. The trailing convergence zone {{was referred to as}} the squall line or cold front. Areas of clouds and rainfall appeared to be focused along these convergence zones. <b>A</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt, also referred to as the warm conveyor belt, is a term describing the flow of a stream of warm moist air originating within the warm sector (or generally equatorward) of an extratropical cyclone in advance of the cold front which slopes up above and poleward (north in the Northern Hemisphere and south in the Southern Hemisphere) of the surface warm front. The concept of the conveyor belt originated in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Woody {{returns to}} Sunnyside and learns from a Chatter Telephone toy {{that there is}} only one way out of the daycare: the trash. Woody and Andy's other toys execute their plan, but accidentally reset Buzz to Spanish mode instead of his old persona. Buzz {{promptly}} allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster, but are cornered by Lotso and his gang. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody reveals what he learned about Lotso and shows proof of Daisy's ownership tag, which Chuckles had kept, to Big Baby. Lotso destroys the tag and says that toys are meant to be discarded, but an enraged Big Baby throws Lotso into the dumpster. As the toys try to leave, Lotso pulls Woody into the dumpster just as the truck collects the trash. The rest of Andy's toys fall into the back of the truck while trying to rescue him, and a falling television lands on Buzz, restoring his memory and normal personality. The truck deposits the toys at a landfill, where they find themselves on <b>a</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt, leading to an incinerator. Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency stop button, only for Lotso to abandon them and escape. The toys resign themselves to their fate, but are soon rescued by the Aliens operating an industrial claw. Lotso is found by a garbage truck driver, who straps him to his truck's radiator grill, and drives away. Woody and the other toys board another garbage truck back to Andy's house.|$|E
