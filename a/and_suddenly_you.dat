It's different to look at life through the eyes of a child, <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>you</b> have a whole new respect for life and you kind of get your innocence back. It's this realisation which I incorporated in 'Nothing Really Matters', 'Little Star' and 'Mer Girl'."

Chuck Campbell of The News Journal called it her [...] "most intriguing track," [...] saying [...] "Miss Jackson relishes {{the role of a}} rocker with unexpected fervor." [...] It was also considered a notable contrast from the [...] "sweet and lovable Janet" [...] of singles such as [...] "Miss You Much," [...] "Love Will Never Do (Without You)," [...] and [...] "Escapade," [...] transitioning to an [...] "edgier front." [...] Whitney Pastorek of Entertainment Weekly stated, [...] "Most hair metal bands would have paid a lifetime in spandex to come up with that guitar line, and then Janet goes and melds it with her funky-fresh backup singers <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>you</b> can dance to it â€” and believe you me, {{it is not easy to}} make You're gonna die into a danceable lyric." [...] Elysa Gardner of Vibe said it [...] "rocks with a frisky muscularity," [...] while author W.K. Stratton praised its [...] "thundering bass." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times commended its [...] "grimy" [...] and [...] "guitar-driven" [...] approach, which [...] "unleashes a guitar riff somewhere between the Robert Palmer hit 'Simply Irresistible' and Deep Purple's 'Smoke on the Water'." [...] Daniel Durchholz of Amazon stated it [...] "burns the place down with a fierce burst of hard rock," [...] while The Sentinel called it a [...] "dance/rock winner." [...] Andy Kellman of AllMusic considered it a [...] "headbanger" [...] with a [...] "hot, distorted lead guitar break, while Alex Henderson applauded Jackson's vocals as used to their [...] "maximum advantage," [...] declaring it a [...] "pop/rock smoker."

2500|$|The song [...] "Iron Man" [...] was {{originally}} entitled [...] "Iron Bloke"; upon hearing the main guitar riff {{for the first}} time, Osbourne remarked that it sounded [...] "like a big iron bloke walking around". The title was later changed to [...] "Iron Man" [...] as bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler composed the lyrics. [...] The riff to [...] "Iron Man" [...] is iconic among heavy metal guitarists, with Osbourne declaring in his memoir that [...] "...Tony Iommi {{turned out to be}} one of the greatest heavy rock riff-makers of all time. Whenever we went into the studio we'd challenge him to beat his last riff and he'd come up with something like 'Iron Man' and blow everyone away." [...] Butler wrote the lyrics as the story of a man who time travels into the future and sees the apocalypse. In the process of returning to the present, he is turned into steel by a magnetic field. He is rendered mute, unable verbally to warn people of his time of the impending destruction. His attempts to communicate are ignored and mocked. This causes Iron Man to become angry and have his revenge on mankind, causing the destruction seen in his vision. [...] "Electric Funeral" [...] also contains apocalyptic imagery dealing with nuclear warfare. In The Last Supper concert film, Iommi remembers that at the time with most bands [...] "it was all the 'flowers in your hair' and we wanted to sing and play about the other side of life." [...] In the 1992 documentary Don't Blame Me Osbourne concurs: [...] "It was me and five kids living in a two bedroom house. My father worked nights, my mother worked days, we had no money, we never had a car, we very rarely went on holiday... <b>And</b> <b>suddenly,</b> <b>you</b> know, we hear about 'If you're going to San Francisco be sure to wear a flower in your hair'. And we're thinking, (contemptuously) 'What the fuck is San Francisco? Where is this? What's all this flower shit? I've got no shoes on my feet. [...] "You could just see that a lot of things were going wrong in the world," [...] Butler recalled to Classic Albums in 2010, [...] "and no one was saying anything about it.

A republican soldier has fallen on your bayonet. The struggles of the wounded man nearly overpower you; you twist and turn and wrench, and drag your musket to and fro, but it is no use; the weapon is jammed between his ribs; you have not space nor time to extricate it; you are obliged to leave it, and on you go unarmed, stumbling over the body of your fallen enemy. Whether the man dies or lives, whether his wound be mortal or no, you will never hear. And so you advance, till gradually you begin to feel, rather than to see, that the blues are retreating from you. You hear unarmed men asking for quarter, begging for their lives, and the sound of entreaty again softens your heart; you think of sparing life, instead of taking it; you embrace your friends as you meet them here and there; you laugh and sing as you feel that you have done your best and have conquered; and when you once more become sufficiently calm to be aware what you are yourself doing, you find that you have a sword in your hand, or a huge pistol; you know not from whom you took them, or where you got them, or in what manner you have used them. How can a man say then, whom he has killed in battle, or whether he has killed any man? I do not recollect that I ever fired a shot at Varin myself, and yet my musket was discharged and the pan was up. I will not say that I ever killed a man; but I will say that I never struck a man who asked for mercy, or fired a shot even on a republican, who had thrown down his arms." ...|$|E
