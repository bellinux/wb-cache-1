500|$|As a teenager, Ford {{attended}} Armstrong Technical High School, {{where he}} played football, basketball and baseball. As a high school athlete, he aspired to play fullback in football, but he later recalled, [...] "I started to grow, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> {{right out of the}} backfield." [...] He was chosen by local sportswriters as an all-city athlete in all three sports in his senior year, and he served as captain of all three teams for one season each.|$|E
500|$|Rihanna later {{described}} the sentiment {{she wanted to}} express as [...] "gangsta", and elaborated on how reggae culture has influenced her musical style: [...] "I'm super inspired by reggae music [...] {{has been a part}} of me since I was born, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> up listening to it. I was exciting for me to take this on as my own and do a song like this, especially with the lyrics being like that." [...] The track was composed during Rihanna's Last Girl on Earth tour. The song's instrumental was recorded by Cary Clark at The Village in Los Angeles. Kuk Harrell produced Rihanna's vocals with Josh Gudwin and Marcos Tovar at Westlake Recording Studios, also in Los Angeles. Bobby Campbell assisted with vocal production and recording. The song was mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Sound Studios in Los Angeles, assisted by Erik Madrid and Christian Plata.|$|E

2500|$|Al Smith grew up {{with his}} family {{struggling}} financially in the Gilded Age; New York City matured and completed major infrastructure projects. The Brooklyn Bridge was being constructed nearby. [...] "The Brooklyn Bridge <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> up together," [...] Smith would later recall. His four grandparents were Irish, German, Italian, and Anglo-Irish, but Smith identified with the Irish-American community and became its leading spokesman in the 1920s.|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Take Me to Church" [...] is a metaphor, {{with the}} protagonist {{comparing}} his lover to religion. The song {{grew out of}} Hozier's frustration with the Catholic Church's teachings which, although he himself {{was raised in the}} Protestant Quaker faith, dominated the social and political outlook of the Irish state. [...] "Growing up, I always saw the hypocrisy of the Catholic church", Hozier {{said in an interview with}} Rolling Stone. [...] "The history speaks for itself <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> incredibly frustrated and angry. I essentially just put that into my words." ...|$|E
2500|$|Accepting the Award, Mr Eastwood said: [...] "Any kind of {{association}} with John Ford is most directors' dream, {{as he was}} certainly a pioneer of American filmmaking <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> up on his films. His Westerns had a great influence on me, as I think they had on everybody. When I worked with Sergio Leone years ago in Italy, his favorite Director was John Ford and he spoke very openly about that influence. I want to thank everybody who is here from the Irish Academy, the John Ford family and thank you to John Ford Ireland." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a November 19, 2015 radio {{interview}} with Hugh Hewitt, Palin {{was asked about}} the legalization of recreational marijuana in Alaska, to which Palin responded, [...] "We've got that libertarian streak in us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> up in Alaska when pot was legal anyway. It was absolutely no big deal. I mean, you didn't smoke it because your parents would strangle you. And if you were a jock and you were, you know, a Christian going to youth group, you just didn't do it, right? And I still believe that. But when it comes to picking our battles, for many of us in Alaska, legalization of marijuana just was never really a bright blip on the radar screen, so it didn't surprise me when the voters of Alaska went back to legalizing it. For some years there, it had not been legalized. I look on the national scene and think, 'Wow, of all things to be fighting over and battling over.' Especially when it comes to medical marijuana, I think, 'Hmm. It's just not my baby.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Menken {{recruited}} musician Robbie Buchanan {{to arrange}} [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] into {{the form of}} a pop duet while Walter Afanasieff was responsible for producing the track. Afanasieff also assisted Buchanan in the arranging of the song. Menken was ultimately pleased with Afanasieff's production, explaining, [...] "Walter Afanasieff ... took it and really molded it into something very different than I ever intended <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> to love it. In a way, Walter made it his own, and I love that." [...] Because Disney could not afford to hire a [...] "big singer", they drafted Canadian singer Celine Dion, who was relatively new to the music industry at the time, to record [...] "Beauty and the Beast". However, the studio feared that she would not draw much media attention because of her relative obscurity in the United States, so they hired American singer Peabo Bryson, who was a more well-known recording artist at the time, to perform alongside her. The newly arranged song was released as the album's lead single on November 25, 1991.|$|E
