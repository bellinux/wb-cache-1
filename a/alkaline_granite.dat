Some medium-small tin deposits are located within or near the contact zones of the granitic intrusions. The <b>alkaline</b> <b>granites</b> share all the features commonly observed in peralkaline A-type granites. They contain alkalic mafic minerals such as riebeckite and aegirine; have high contents of SiO 2, alkalis, Rb, Th, Zr, Hf, REE (except Eu), and high ratios of FeO*/MgO and Ga/Al; and show strong depletions in Ba, Sr, Eu in the spidergrams. Laser ablation-ICPMS U–Pb zircon geochronology indicates a crystallization age of ca. 305 Ma for the granites; TIMS analyses of the granites found high εNd(T) values of + 5. 9 to + 6. 5. Considering their geochemical features, alkaline gran-ites most likely formed by fractional crystallization of granodioritic magmas, which were probably produced by partial melting of lower crustal basaltic to andesitic rocks formed from oceanic crustal materials that were deeply buried during late Paleozoic subduction and accretion. Six molybdenite samples from the Sareshike tin deposit in East Junggar yielded an isochron age of 307 ± 11 Ma (2 σ) and a weighted mean model age of 306. 5 ± 3. 4 Ma, consistent with zircon U–Pb ages of the <b>alkaline</b> <b>granites.</b> Low Re contents (0. 323 – 0. 961 ppm) in the molybdenite suggest that they originated from crustal sources related to the <b>alkaline</b> <b>granites.</b> Considering their identical ages, close spatial distribution, and similar sources, w...|$|R

40|$|The Altai orogen {{forms the}} {{southern}} part of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), the world's largest accretionary orogen. However, its tectonic evolution, particularly during the late Paleozoic, is still not well understood. U-Pb zircon analyses for the Bulgen <b>alkaline</b> <b>granite</b> yield crystallization ages of 358 ± 4 Ma (SHRIMP) and 354 ± 4 Ma (LA-ICP-MS). These ages are significantly younger than published emplacement ages for subduction/collision-related syn-orogenic granitoids (460 - 375 Ma) in this region. The Bulgen granite has high SiO 2, total alkalis, rare earth elements, HFSE (Th, Zr, Hf, Nb, and Ce), and low Ba, Sr with pronounced negative anomalies in Eu, Ba, Sr, P, and Ti, showing a clear A-type geochemical signature. The granite records high εNd(t) values of + 6. 3 to + 6. 4 and young model ages (T DM) of ca. 600 Ma. The Bulgen <b>alkaline</b> <b>granite</b> is largely undeformed as opposed to the early-middle Paleozoic counterparts, which form elongated deformed bodies parallel to the prevailing tectonic fabric (NW direction). Available data suggest that magmatism in the southern Altai region evolved from early-middle Paleozoic I-type tholeiitic and calc-alkaline granitoids to late Paleozoic A-type alkaline granitoids. The high εNd(t) values of the Bulgen <b>alkaline</b> <b>granite</b> indicate a homogeneous juvenile mantle source, whereas the earlymiddle Paleozoic granitoids are characterized by lower and more variable εNd(t) values (- 2. 6 to + 4. 2). These differences provide an important insight into the late Paleozoic orogenic processes of the Chinese Altai and indicate a significant change of the tectonic regime from a syn-orogenic regional compression setting to a post-orogenic extensional one.

40|$|Anorogenic {{alkaline}} ring-type complexes form within continental plate settings. Alkaline magmatism {{is derived}} from the upper mantle, in which mantle metasomatism plays an important part, as well as from partial melting of the lower crust. Radial and concentric fractures develop during the ascent of alkaline magma. Extrusion of basic and felsic magma takes place along these fractures with felsic volcanics building-up central volcanoes. As a result of emptying of the magma chamber, the superstructure of the volcano collapses and a caldera is formed. During the caldera stage syenitic and granitic material are intruded into ring fractures. Alkaline ring-type complexes may be classified as (i) alkaline qranite and syenite-type and (ii) carbonatite and undersaturated-type. These ring-type complexes occur as distinct igneous provinces. Some major provinces occur in Brazil, Corsica, Namibia, Nigeria, Norway, Saudi-Arabia and Sudan. In Namibia the Damaraland igneous province is of Mesozoic aqe and it contains 15 alkaline ring-type complexes. These complexes are situated along north-eastern trends which correspond to transform directions of the South Atlantic. During the opening of the South Atlantic (Gondwana breakup) Pan-African age lineaments were reactivated which allowed emplacement of anorogenic alkaline magmatism. A zonation of <b>alkaline</b> <b>granite</b> and syenitetype in the west and carbonatite and undersaturated-type ring-complexes in the east correlates with down- and upwarp axes parallel to the line of Gondwana fragmentation. Alkali- and H⁺-metasomatism is related to the alkaline and syenite-type whereas alkali metasomatism (fenitization) is associated with carbonatite and undersaturated-type ring-complexes. Sn, W and Ta mineralization is associated with alkaline granites of some of the <b>alkaline</b> <b>granite</b> and syenite-type ring-complexes. Fe, F, PO₄, Nb, Th, REE, Sr, Zn and Pb mineralization is associated with carbonatite complexes. Potential exists for: (i) porphyry Cu-Mo and epithermal-type (Au, Ag, Pt-metals, base metals) mineralization in the <b>alkaline</b> <b>granite</b> and syenite-type ring-complexes and (ii) disseminated Cu, Au, Aq and Pt-metals in carbonatite and undersaturated-type ring-complexe...|$|E

The {{northern part of the}} Indian Plate in northern Pakistan is intruded by a number of Upper Carboniferous alkaline complexes including the Ambela and Warsak plutons. As in the Kola Peninsula, the <b>alkaline</b> <b>granites</b> of northern Pakistan host a range of REE-rich minerals. Many of these are of gem quality. Zagi Mountain is located in the Warsak area of the Mulla Ghori tehsil of the Kyber Agency, part of the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan. The area is underlain by granites of the Warsak igneous complex. The Warsak complex is made up of a series of sill-like <b>alkaline</b> <b>granites,</b> micro-granites, gabbros and dolerites. The granitic rocks contain aegirine, riebeckite and astrophyllite. The granites are rich in the rare earth elements and contain a number of REE-bearing gem minerals. These include bastnaesite-(Ce), parasite-(Ce), monazite-(Ce), xenotime-(Y), titanite, genthelvite, eudideymite together with non REE-bearing grossular garnet, quartz and zircon. (Khan & Marwat, 2007). Analytical data presented here document the chemistry of light REE bearing bastnaesite, parisite and monazite, and heavy REE bearing xenotime. Most of the REE phases are located along fractures and veins or in vugs and show good crystal shapes. These textures are typical of minerals precipitated into open space fillings from hydrothermal fluids. This suggests fractionation of the REE into late stages of the alkaline magma prior to their being partitioned into hydrothermal fluids...|$|R
40|$|The Keivy domain {{differs from}} the other {{structures}} of the Kola region by the specific composition of the metamorphic complexes, {{the presence of the}} oldest for the region <b>alkaline</b> <b>granites</b> and gabbroanorthosites associated with them {{as well as by the}} presence of unique mineral deposits. The previous studies of the Keivy structure showed that within this structure there are metasedimentary formations that differ from both Early Precambrian metasedimentary rock associations of the Kola region and Phanerozoic sedimentary complexes in the content of titanium and the ratio Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2. The present study confirms the correctness of this conclusion. The authors have attempted the search of the generalized indicator (trend) describing the nature of changes in the chemical composition of rocks in the transition from Low-Ti to High-Ti varieties of rocks (with simultaneous increase in the ratio Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2). To solve this problem the method of search of differences in the specified number of sets has been used with the partial order relation introduced by the researcher. The formations of the same type and age, namely metapelites of the Chervurtskaya suite of the Keivy series, have been chosen as the informational basis. Such indicator has been found. It describes the process which besides a significant titanium input was accompanied by a simultaneous increase in the content of CaO and decrease in the content of Al 2 O 3, ΣFe, and Na 2 O. It must be emphasized that the obtained trend is not related to the supergene processes characterized by the similar behavior of titanium with aluminum and iron which is especially clearly exhibited in the formation of crusts of weathering. The location on this generalized indicator of the points of rock compositions of all strata of the geological section of the Keivy domain taken far or close to <b>alkaline</b> <b>granites</b> corresponds to the position of less or more titaniferous rocks, thus confirming the assumption of a metasomatic alteration of the latter. The fact that all the metasedimentary Keivy formations are subjected to metasomatic alteration most probably related to the Archean complexes of <b>alkaline</b> <b>granites,</b> which is confirmed by direct geological observations of the relationships of the Lebyazhinskiye and Chervurtskiye rock complexes with <b>alkaline</b> <b>granites,</b> allows us to speak about their Archean age...|$|R

The existence of two groups of rocks in this complex with different initial Pb and Nd isotopic characteristics has been evidenced: 1. (1) The Mahé group, comprising the biotite-hornblende granite, the weakly <b>alkaline</b> <b>granite</b> and their melanocratic (dioritic to gabbroic) xenoliths, yields ε{lunate}NdBE (705 Ma) = + 3. 1; their Pb isotopic compositions in K-feldspar are only slightly more radiogenic than those of mantle-derived rocks of the same age. 2.

40|$|ABSTRACT The Ribeira and Dom Feliciano {{collision}} belts are constituted of many overthrust bounded entities, some of {{them with}} very different stratigraphic record. They were intensively modified by large transcurrent faults. Two supercycles, one Mesoproterozoic and the other Neoproterozoic, has been recognized {{in the evolution of}} the belts, mainly based on the study of the meta-sedimentary complexes. The Mesoproterozoic records a segmented sedimentary basin supercycle and metamorphism; in early Neoproterozoic the convergence zone was stretched and collapsed and the basins evolved through a complete sedimentary supercycle. Inversion is indicated by collisional granites from 750 Ma, culminating with strong deformation, closure of basins, metamorphism and allochthons formation in mainly frontal collision around 650 Ma. Flexural marine molasse basins were formed during Vendian. New inversion was produced by strong convergence and lateral movement of blocks, subcontinental mantle and crustal fusion, late tectonic migmatite and granite intrusions (600 - 560 Ma).

It’s composed by felsic gneissic rocks of (per) alkaline type, represented by syenites with sodic inossilicates (riebeckite and/or aegirine), nefelinic syenites and hastingsitic syenites, as well as hedenbergitic granites. Most of riebeckitic syenites presents (Zr/Nb) < 10, (Y/Nb) < 0. 7 e (Th/Nb) < 0. 3, while hastingsitic ones and hedenbergitic granites reveal higher values of these ratios (15. 0, 2. 0 e 0. 6, respectively). The highest contents of Zr (4800 ppm) are also observed on peralkaline terms, with minimum values measured on <b>alkaline</b> <b>granites</b> (135 ppm). Maximum contents of F (6100 ppm) and Cl (7233 ppm) have been determined on riebeckitic and nefelino-sodalitic syenites, respectively, and seems that halogenous contents may be correlated with devolatilization processes, deformation/micro-fracturation and REE mobility. Even though irregular crystallization of phases which consume high contents of REE (e. g. allanite) can disturbe the correspondent geochemical signatures, {{it is still possible}} to identify, in most of the cases, distinctions between maximum values of (La/Sm) N, (La/Lu) N and (Gd/Lu) N of peralkaline rocks (29. 6, 11. 6, 2. 4), hastingsitic syenites (14. 8, 4. 8, 2. 0) and <b>alkaline</b> <b>granites</b> (4. 0, 3. 1, 1. 7). Riebeckitic and nefelinic facies present, simultaniously, the sharpest negative anomalies of Ti and the less marked negative anomalies of Nb (means of 0. 9 and 0. 7), which can be interpreted as a result of differentiation processes with small to moderate contributions of crustal contamination; comparatively, this anomaly is higher in hastingsitic (0. 6) and granitic terms (0. 4). Obtained in a small set of mafic and felsic samples, Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotopic data, show the vulnerability of the first system to post-magmatic processes.

The emerald deposit genesis is consistent with a typical granite-related emerald vein system from dominantly magmatic fluid sources. Emerald mineralization occurs within pegmatite veins which are hosted within Cambrian black shale and Late Carboniferous quartz syenite sills, and intruded by a Permo-Triassic <b>alkaline</b> <b>granite.</b> Muscovite from an emerald-bearing pegmatite at Byrud yielded an Ar-Ar plateau age of 233. 4 ± 2. 0 Ma. The emerald display colour zonation alternating between emerald and beryl. Two dominant fluid inclusions types are identified: two-phase (vapour+liquid) and three-phase (brine+vapour+halite) fluid inclusions. Raman analyses indicate molar gas fractions for CO 2, N 2, CH 4, and H 2 S are approximately 0. 8974, 0. 0261, 0. 0354, and 0. 0410, respectively. Formational temperatures and pressures of approximately 160 °C to 385 °C and below 1000 bars were derived from fluid inclusion data and lithostatic pressure estimates from fluid inclusion studies within the Oslo Paleorift. The emerald from the Byrud mine displays growth zoning and banding from green emerald to colourless beryl. The use of chemical analyses, fluid inclusions and petrography is consistent with boiling as a mechanism for this distinct ‘striped’ colour zonation or banding. These zones are due to enrichment of vanadium and chromium in the green bands which host salt-saturated aqueous primary fluid inclusions with an overall 31 mass percent NaCl equivalent salinity. Vapour-rich primary fluid inclusions dominate within the colourless bands of the zoned emerald. The chemical compositions of the salt-saturated and the vapour-rich inclusions indicate they represent the coexisting liquid and vapour portions of a two-phase boiling system.

The early underplating also resulted in not only sedimentary environments in the rift but also the differentiation of the initial thermal architecture in the crust that controlled different metamorphism types and P-T-t paths in he different part of the rift. The later underplating resulted in the formations of the A-type Liaoji Granites of about 2. 17 Ga in the lower crust and the pegmatite of 2. 2 Ga and 2. 0 Ga, and bedding-parallel deformation. However, the main orogenic deformations occurred at a range from 1. 911 to 1. 883 Ga accompanying with the high-pressure metamorphism in the southern part of the orogen, the closing of the rift and the compressional deformations. Then, from 1. 875 to 1. 66 Ga, a little lithospheric blocks were delaminated, anorogenic plutons such as rapakivii granite and syenite intruded, the pegmatite veins and mafic dyke swarm developed and crosscut all the structural traces, the Yishulazi Group deposited. Meanwhile, the Dabie-Sulu orogen in the south of the eastern block was an intensive active continental margin at a range from 1. 7 to 1. 6 Ga. After 1. 6 Ga, the Dabie-Sulu orogen underwent a series of crust reworking, evidently differentiating from the major eastern block. In summary, the tectono-thermal evolution in the crust is dominated by the underplating style, collisional processes and delamination types in the deep lithosphere. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The Thor Lake rare-metal (Y-REE-Nb-Ta-Zr-Be) deposit, {{located about}} 100 {{kilometers}} southeast of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada, {{is regarded as}} one of the largest high field strength elements (HFSE, including Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, Ti, Y, and the lanthanides) deposits and hosted by <b>alkaline</b> <b>granite</b> and syenite. The T Zone deposit, one of the main mineralized zones at Thor Lake, is characterized by HFSE mineralization that has intimate connection to hydrothermal activities. The T Zone at Thor Lake provides an excellent opportunity to assess the mobility and precipitation of HFSE in magmatic-hydrothermal systems. The T Zone has been identified as a pegmatite that experienced multiple alteration stages. Most HFSE minerals were hydrothermally formed, as indicated by their occurrence in pseudomorphs. The most important precursor minerals for those HFSE-rich and Be-rich pseudomorphs are aegirine and mica-group minerals. The HFSE concentrations in aegirine and mica are not sufficiently high. Therefore, a dissolution-reprecipitation model cannot explain the presence of zircon and other HFSE minerals that pseudomorph aegirine. Rather, the addition of HFSE by hydrothermal fluids is required. Mass transfer calculations show that HFSE were added or removed during different alteration events. Related to the identified alteration events, the remobilization patterns of HFSE reveal that transport and precipitation of HFSE in the T Zone was likely caused by fluids with different characteristics. Magmatic and various types of hydrothermal zircon are characterized by different trace element chemistry. Titanium-in-zircon geothermometer was employed to constrain the mineralizing temperatures of the T Zone. The crystallization temperatures for the magmatic zircon from the host granite range from 792 to 1195 °C. Extremely high Ti concentrations in hydrothermal zircon from the T Zone prevent the application of Ti-in-zircon geothermometry. Primary fluid inclusion assemblages (FIAs) related to precipitation of various HFSE minerals in the T Zone were identified. Microthermometric analysis has revealed that there were likely two populations of fluids in the T Zone. According to fluid inclusion LA-ICP-MS analysis and EDS decrepitate analysis, the fluids responsible for HFSE transport in the T Zone contain significant HFSE, are aqueous and dominated by Na and Cl with trace amounts of CO 2 and CH 4...|$|E
40|$|Based on mineralogical, geochemical and textural characteristics, {{a variety}} of granite types was {{identified}} amongstthe intrusions emplaced during the tectonic activity along the Remígio-Pocinhos shear zone in NE Brazil during the lateststages of the Brasiliano orogeny. They include peraluminous granites with I-type mineralogical compositions as well astransitional-to-alkaline geochemical characteristics. These granites contain mafic to intermediate microgranular enclaves. Overall, they {{are very similar to}} many other Brasiliano-age plutons in the extreme NE of Brazil. Metaluminous alkalinegranites with aegirine-augite usually contain andradite as a minor phase, and titanite as an important accessory mineral. Several aspects of their trace element geochemistry repeat features of syn to late- tectonic <b>alkaline</b> <b>granites</b> in other parts ofNE Brazil and {{in the rest of the}} world. The shear zone has deep roots, and the heat flow during granite genesis was probablyhigh. A variety of lower crustal source rocks was probably involved in the genesis of these granites...|$|R
40|$|The primary isotopic {{characteristics}} of <b>alkaline</b> <b>granites</b> are often obscured by secondary processes enhanced by their unusual chemical compositions. This {{is true for}} radiogenic {{as well as for}} stable isotopes. For example, the 87 Sr 86 Sr ratios can vary drastically in closed systems because of very high Rb/Sr ratios and can also be easily modified by direct or indirect interaction with continental crust because of low Sr concentrations. Moreover, the frequent occurrence of the granitic massifs as hypovolcanic complexes increases the probability of interaction with meteoric waters which is a common source of important isotopic variability. The investigation of oxygen isotope systematics in alkaline acidic rocks from various environments shows the 18 O content of their quartz to be highly invariable, and the δ 18 O values to be close to the mantle range of values. This is due to the resistance of quartz to isotopic exchange, which makes it a good tracer of primary isotopic composition. If we eliminate the quartz δ 18 O values for which interaction with meteoric water is well documented (five samples), the total range of variation (seventeen samples) is from 6. 0 to 7. 3 ‰ relative to SMOW. The values can easily be accounted for by, and correspond to, equilibrium with mantle-type material in a temperature range of 1200 - 800 °C. If we consider possible effects of fractional crystallization, this temperature range can probably be reduced to its lower limit which is much more likely for rocks of acidic composition.

40|$|Three suites of <b>alkaline</b> <b>granite</b> can be {{recognised}} in the Narraburra Complex at {{the triple}} junction of the Tumut, Giralambone-Goonumbla and Wagga Zones, central southern New South Wales. On the basis of K 2 O/Na 2 O ratios, biotite and hornblende-biotite potassic I-type granites have been assigned to the Gilmore Hill (K 2 O/Na 2 O 1. 00) and Barmedman Suites (K 2 O/Na 2 O > 1. 2). These are metaluminous to weakly peraluminous suites that crystallised from high-temperature,reduced magmas with the least fractionated members of each suite having high Ba and low Rb abundances compared to other Lachlan Fold Belt granites. Fractionated members of these suites have high abundances of high-field-strength elements, similar to those observed in A-type granites. Arfvedsonite and aegirine-arfvedsonite granites have been assigned to the peralkaline Narraburra Suite. Granites from this suite have chemistry consistent with them being the intrusive equivalents of comendites and they are also similar in some respects to A-type granites: they have, for example, particularly high abundances of Zr. The A-type signature is, however, {{at least in part}} the result of strong fractionation. Total-rock Rb-Sr isotopic analyses from both I-type suites plot on the same isochron, giving an age of 365 ± 4 Ma (Srl = 0. 70388 ± 53). A total-rock isochron for the peralkaline Narraburra Suite gives a less well-defined age of 358 ± 9 Ma (Srl = 0. 7013 ± 80). The Late Devonian Rb-Sr ages may be emplacement ages or a result of resetting during fluid-rock interaction. Although granites of the Narraburra Complex have geochemical affinities with alkaline granites formed late in orogenic cycles, they post-date arc magmatism by at least 75 million years and they formed in a within-plate setting. Magmatism was related to localised reactivation of major faults (Gilmore Fault and the Parkes Thrust) in the region, and to partial melting involving both enriched mantle and Ordovician shoshonitic crustal components. Emplacement of the Narraburra Complex was contemporaneous with magmatism in the Central Victorian Magmatic Province and A-type magmatism in eastern New South Wales. Collectively, all these magmatic events were related to extension post-dating amalgamation of the western and central/eastern subprovinces of the Lachlan Fold Belt...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe eastern Songpan Ganze accretionary-orogenic wedge (northern Tibetan plateau) is {{characterized}} by extensive magmatism coeval with Middle to Upper Triassic closure of the Paleotethys Ocean along a double subduction system, traced by the Kunlun-Anyemaqen suture {{to the north and}} the Jinsha-Litang suture to the south. New field, petrographic and geochemical data on Mesozoic plutons intrusive into Triassic metasediments of the eastern Songpan Ganze wedge are presented and integrated in a review of available data for the region. Three types of granitoids are distinguished: (i) high-K calc-alkaline granite to granodiorite (Yanggon, Maoergai, Markam, Sheng Meng, Xue Sheng, Taiyanghe, Menggu, Manai, Dusong Xian, Tagong and Jiulong plutons), (ii) high-K <b>alkaline</b> <b>granite</b> (Nyanbaoyeche and Rilong plutons and the Niuxingou shoshonitic syenite), and (iii) peraluminous S-type granite (Markam and Manai leucogranites). Elemental and isotopic signatures of these granitoids are consistent with the implication of both crustal (Yangtze craton, and Songpan Ganze metasediments) and mantle (asthenospheric mantle and metasomatised lithospheric mantle) sources. Based on (i) the ages of the plutons that are concomitant {{with the end of the}} northern and southern subductions of the Paleo-Tethys, (ii) the position of the plutons intrusive in the crustal tectonically accreted units decoupled from the downgoing plate of this double subduction system, (iii) the diversity of their petrological and geochemical signatures, we propose that magma emplaced in the Songpan Ganze accretionary-orogenic wedge were generated at the end of the Paleotethys closure in a context of slab retreat, accommodated by a tear fault along the passive margin of the South China block. Indeed, we argue that this context is the most favourable to trigger synchronous partial melting of (i) the suprasubduction enriched mantle wedge owing to lowering of the mantle solidus by metasomatism, (ii) the upwelled undepleted asthenospheric mantle into the tear fault owing to decompression, (iii) the metasomatized lithospheric continental mantle of the Yangtze craton owing to the temperature increase associated to the asthenospheric upwelling and (iv) the rocks of the Songpan Ganze accretionary wedge composed of metasediments and Yangtze continental margin basement owing to the combined effects of increased radioactive heat production and mantle heat flux. We propose that the concentration of plutons along the eastern margin of the Songpan Ganze results from focussed migration and emplacement of the granitic magmas guided by the development of a tear fault along the former passive eastern margin of the Yangtze craton as a consequence of the Paleotethys slab retreat...|$|E

Studies of pedogenesis associated with altitudinal variation, vegetation type and soil carbon content on the same type of parent rock are very limited in inter-tropical mountain areas. Therefore the altitudinal variation of soil pedogenesis through 9 selected profiles from the altitude of 1340 m to 3143 mast, the summit of the Fan Si Pan Mountain, in the north of Vietnam was examined. Fan Si Pan Mountain is composed of a homogenous <b>alkaline</b> <b>granite</b> rock and is the highest point of the Inter-tropical Continental Asia. The Soil Organic Matter properties (C, N, delta C- 13 and delta N- 15 contents) of the different grain-size fractions of the topsoil of 4 selected profiles corresponding to different ecosystems were also examined. Three zones of different soil forming processes were present: Acrisols and Alisols at lower altitudes in sub montane forest, Podzols formed in montane and upper montane forest while Umbrisols formed at high altitude where the forest vegetation had given way to a shrubby vegetation or a steppe composed of dwarfed bamboo. With altitude, soils become sandier, have higher concentration of SiO 2 and are lower in Al 2 O 3. The selective Fe and Al oxalate (Fe-o and Al-o) and pyrophosphate (Few and Alp) extracts show a clear discrepancy between Acrisols or Umbrisols with no clear variation with soil depth and Podzols with high enrichment in their Bs horizon. The SOM status is highly dependent of the organic matter input by the vegetation. In Acrisols, the SOC is linked to the fine fraction within the soil profile with rapid turnover and low C/N values. Podzols are formed by the accumulation on soil surface of OM enriched in the coarse fraction with depleted delta N- 15 and high C/N values. The organic matter input is exogenic and probably seasonal from leaves forming the surface litter while in Acrisols or Umbrisols the SOC is mainly linked to the fine fraction, and with constant delta N- 15 values at depth. In Umbrisols, the SOC origin seems to be linked with endogenic inputs deep in the soil profile mostly produced by the decay of bamboo roots. In this tropical mountainous soil catena, the soil carbon mineralization depends not only on temperature and organo-metallic complexes that stabilize the non labile carbon pool but also is controlled by the pedogenetic process, which is linked with the vegetal ecosystem change with altitude...|$|E

The sapphirine occurrence of the Kambam valley is the southern most, reported {{so far in the}} southern granulite terrain (SGT). Here we report the sapphirine occurrences of the eastern Kodaikanal ranges cluster around the Kambam fault, which hosts carbonatite. In addition, numerous syenite bodies and <b>alkaline</b> <b>granites</b> are common to the Kodaikanal ranges, The age of garnet separates (Sm-Nd garnet/whole rock) of Kambam valley and Kodaikanal ranges is around 550 to 520 Ma. This indirectly gives the age of sapphirine formation, as sapphirine develops after garnet. The age of the carbonatite, syenite bodies and alkali granites which occur along these intra-cratonic lineaments ranges between 790 and 550 Ma. The close spatial association of the high temperature sapphirine-bearing assemblages with the Kambam fault strongly suggest that their formation is closely linked to Pan-African tectonothermal event...|$|R

The mineralogical and geochemical {{character of the}} plutons allows us to describe an evolution of the magmatism, in space and time, from a subduction-related type in the northern part, to a within-plate subalkaline type in the southern part. The first magmatic activity coeval with {{the closing of the}} Khzama oceanic basin in the north is little evolved and of oceanic type (dominantly gabbros and basalts). It is followed by a low potassic calc-alkaline magmatism (gabbro-diorites, tonalites and trondhjemites of Nebdas pluton) and by a voluminous highly potassic calcalkaline magmatism (Askaoun and Ifouachguel plutons) that marks the collisional period.
