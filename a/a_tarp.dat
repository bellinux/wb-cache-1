5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with Utada entering a warehouse, and lifts <b>a</b> <b>tarp</b> off a hover cycle. As the camera pans away from the bike, Utada sits down and starts the bike. The first verse opens with Utada singing to the camera in a warehouse, whilst intercut scenes have her driving throughout Shibuya, Japan. As the verse progresses, two more clones of Utada appear and sing behind the original Utada. As the chorus starts, the hover cycle starts grinding against the road as she rides through small streets and corners. During the second verse, Utada stops through a city centre as shots of the clones appear on city billboards. She takes of her goggles, {{and stares at the}} moon, while close-up of the clone's faces are seen singing to the track.|$|E

25|$|In 1906, the Pirates {{were the}} first {{baseball}} team to cover their field with <b>a</b> <b>tarp</b> during inclement weather, and though the field was kept dry from the rain, the Allegheny River still caused problems. Flooding sometimes covered the entire outfield with inches of standing water, causing ground rules that gave any ground ball hit into the outfield an automatic single. In 1907, Pittsburg's pitcher Nick Maddox threw a no-hitter at Exposition Park.|$|E

25|$|The pyramid {{method of}} {{harvesting}} worm compost {{is commonly used}} in small-scale vermiculture, and is considered the simplest method for single layer bins.

This lighter mix is placed into small piles on <b>a</b> <b>tarp</b> under the sunlight. The worms instinctively burrow {{to the bottom of the}} pile. After a few minutes, the top of the pyramid is removed repeatedly, until the worms are again visible. This repeats until the mound is composed mostly of worms.|$|E

25|$|When the Marlins began play in 1993, {{baseball}} capacity {{was initially}} reduced to 47,662, {{with most of}} the upper level covered with <b>a</b> <b>tarp.</b> In addition to Huizenga's desire create a more intimate atmosphere for baseball, most of the seats in the upper level would have been too far from the field to be of any use during the regular season. The stadium's baseball capacity was further reduced over the years, and finally settled at 38,560 seats. However, the Marlins would usually open the entire upper level for the postseason. In the 1997 World Series, the Marlins played before crowds of over 67,000 fans, some of the highest postseason attendance figures in MLB history, only exceeded by Cleveland Stadium, home of the Cleveland Indians during the 1948 and 1954 World Series, old Yankee Stadium prior to its mid 1970s renovation, and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the temporary home of the Los Angeles Dodgers (before Dodger Stadium was opened) in the 1959 World Series.|$|E

500|$|All hay and {{concentrated}} feeds {{must be kept}} dry and free of mold, rodent feces, {{and other types of}} contamination that may cause illness in horses.

[...] Concentrates take up less storage space, are less of a fire hazard, and are usually kept in a barn or enclosed shed.

Aviation Week said the helicopter {{appeared to be a}} significantly modified MH-60 Black Hawk. Serial numbers found at the scene were consistent with an MH-60 built in 2009.

500|$|The Panthers {{have three}} open-air fields next to Bank of America Stadium where they {{currently}} hold their practices; during the 1995 season, {{when the team}} played their home games in South Carolina, the team held their practices at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, South Carolina. Because the practice fields, along with the stadium, are located in uptown Charlotte, the fields are directly visible from skyscrapers {{as well as from}} a four-story condominium located across the street. According to Mike Cranston, a running joke said that the Panthers' division rivals had pooled their resources to purchase a room on the building's top floor, and that a fire at the condominium was caused by the Panthers organization. In order to prevent people from seeing inside the field while the team is practicing, the team has added [...] "strategically planted trees and <b>a</b> <b>tarp</b> over the... fence surrounding the fields". Additionally, they employ a security team to watch for and chase away any people who stop alongside the fence surrounding the field. In the event of bad weather, the team moves their practices to an indoor sports facility about 10 miles from the stadium. The team does not own this facility. The Panthers have hosted their annual training camp at Wofford College in Spartanburg, South Carolina, since 1995.|$|E
