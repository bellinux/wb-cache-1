40|$|Deep {{directed}} generative {{models have}} {{attracted much attention}} recently due to their generative modeling nature and powerful data representation ability. In this paper, we review different structures of deep directed generative models and the learning and inference algorithms associated with the structures. We focus on a specific structure that consists of layers of Bayesian Networks due to the property of capturing inherent and rich dependencies among latent variables. The major difficulty of learning and inference with deep directed models with many latent variables is the intractable inference due to the dependencies among the latent variables and the exponential number of latent variable configurations. Current solutions use variational methods often through an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>network</b> to approximate the posterior probability inference. In contrast, inference can also be performed directly without using any <b>auxiliary</b> <b>network</b> to maximally preserve the dependencies among the latent variables. Specifically, by exploiting the sparse representation with the latent space, max-max instead of max-sum operation {{can be used to}} overcome the exponential number of latent configurations. Furthermore, the max-max operation and augmented coordinate ascent are applied to both supervised and unsupervised learning as well as to various inference. Quantitative evaluations on benchmark datasets of different models are given for both data representation and feature learning tasks. Comment: Accepted to IEEE Signal Processing Magazin...|$|E

The goal of P 2 P systems is to harness all available resources (storage, bandwidth, and CPU) in the P 2 P network so that users can access all available objects efficiently. P 2 P aims to directly balance the distribution of items among the nodes. With the notion of virtual servers, peers participating in a heterogeneous, structured peer-to-peer (P 2 P) network may host different numbers of virtual servers, and by migrating virtual servers, peers can balance their loads proportional to their capacities.

There are many resonant topologies that can offer this, but the asymmetrical pulse-width modulated (APWM) resonant DC/DC converter {{is a simple}} topology that operates at a constant frequency and with near-zero voltage switching losses. However, the range of input voltage where high efficiency is maintained is narrow. After a certain limit, zero voltage switching is lost and the voltage stress on the resonant inductor becomes too high.

This effort is critical to the fundamental understanding of the scalability of such network. However, due to the heterogeneity in available frequency bands at each node, the asymptotic capacity is much more difficult to develop than prior efforts for other types of wireless networks.

To efficiently manage traffic and collect information, we use a centralized SDN architecture in our design. The proposed system enables mobile devices to choose the most beneficial AP for offloading. The experimental evaluation of our prototype implementation demonstrates that this architecture can achieve optimal traffic offloading by considering different real factors instead of making naive decisions.

Because the proposed method is based on purely electric input and output measurements, it allows for accurate results in the identification and localization of damages. Use of the electric frequency-response function to identify the mechanical damage leads to nonconvex optimization problems; therefore the proposed sensitivity-enhanced identification procedure becomes computationally efficient if an a priori knowledge about the damage is available.

30|$|The {{first step}} in {{baseband}} processing is satellite signal acquisition. The signal acquisition module determines whether a certain satellite is “visible” in the sky from the observer’s viewpoint.

According {{to the principle of}} satellite positioning, a GNSS receiver requires at least four visible navigation satellites to achieve a positioning in 3 D space [4]. When there is no <b>auxiliary</b> <b>network</b> to provide assisting information, the receiver must sift through all navigation satellite signals to find at least four visible satellites to perform the positioning calculation. Thus, a fast and accurate acquisition of visible satellite signals provides a strong starting point for the subsequent positioning procedure {{and is one of the}} key steps for baseband signal processing.|$|E

40|$|Researchers {{describe}} a newly-developed {{artificial neural network}} algorithm for solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) which includes a learning component that can significantly improve {{the performance of the}} network from run to run. The network, referred to as the Guarded Discrete Stochastic (GDS) network, is based on the discrete Hopfield network but differs from it primarily in that <b>auxiliary</b> <b>networks</b> (guards) are asymmetrically coupled to the main network to enforce certain types of constraints. Although the presence of asymmetric connections implies that the network may not converge, it was found that, for certain classes of problems, the network often quickly converges to find satisfactory solutions when they exist. The network can run efficiently on serial machines and can find solutions to very large problems (e. g., N-queens for N as large as 1024). One advantage of the network architecture is that network connection strengths need not be instantiated when the network is established: they are needed only when a participating neural element transitions from off to on. They have exploited this feature to devise a learning algorithm, based on consistency techniques for discrete CSPs, that updates the network biases and connection strengths and thus improves the network performance...|$|R
40|$|A crucial privacy-driven issue {{nowadays}} is re-identifying anonymized {{social networks}} by mapping them to correlated cross-domain <b>auxiliary</b> <b>networks.</b> Prior works are typically based on modeling social networks as random graphs representing users and their relations, and subsequently quantify {{the quality of}} mappings through cost functions that are proposed without sufficient rationale. Also, it remains unknown how to algorithmically meet the demand of such quantifications, i. e., to find the minimizer of the cost functions. We address those concerns in a more realistic social network modeling parameterized by community structures that can be leveraged as side information for de-anonymization. By Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation, our first contribution is new and well justified cost functions, which, when minimized, enjoy superiority to previous ones in finding the correct mapping with the highest probability. The feasibility of the cost functions is then {{for the first time}} algorithmically characterized. While proving the general multiplicative inapproximability, we are able to propose two algorithms, which, respectively, enjoy an ϵ-additive approximation and a conditional optimality in carrying out successful user re-identification. Our theoretical findings are empirically validated, with a notable dataset extracted from rare true cross-domain networks that reproduce genuine social network de-anonymization. Both theoretical and empirical observations also manifest the importance of community information in enhancing privacy inferencing. Comment: 18 page...|$|R

Such mapping for data distribution has an inherent load balance problem. Data redistribution algorithms based on randomized matching of heavily loaded nodes with light ones {{can deal with the}} dynamics of DHTs. However, they are unable to consider the proximity of the nodes simultaneously. There are other methods that rely on <b>auxiliary</b> <b>networks</b> to facilitate localityaware load redistribution. Due to the cost of network construction and maintenance, the locality-aware algorithms can hardly work for DHTs with churn. This paper presents a locality-aware randomized load-balancing algorithm to deal with both the proximity and network churn at the same time. We introduce a factor of randomness in the probing of lightly loaded nodes in a range of proximity. We further improve the efficiency by allowing the probing of multiple candidates (d-way) at a time. Simulation results show the superiority of the locality-aware two-way randomized algorithm in comparison with other random or locality-aware algorithms. In DHTs with churn, it performs no worse than the best churn-resilient algorithm. It takes advantage of node capacity heterogeneity and achieves good load balance effectively even in a skewed distribution of items.
