40|$|This {{research}} {{was aimed at}} studying about analyzing the topics of grammar in English textbook for first year Senior High School based on the 2006 English curriculum. This study attempted to answer the topics of grammar that are presented in an English textbook. This study used descriptive research design. The object of this {{research was}} Look Ahead 1 published by Erlangga. The data collection method used was documentation. The finding of this research showed that were found about 20 topics of grammar in Look Ahead 1 published by Erlangga, they were noun phrase (the <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> in the form of filling in the blank), pronoun (the <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> in the form of taking turning asking question, completing the text and circling the word), simple past tense (the <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> in the form of asking question and filling in the blank), time conjunctions (the <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> in the form of giving sample and completing the functional text, an e-mail), punctuation (the <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> in the form of indicating the sentences), appositive (the <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> in the form of boxing the material, and supplying), direct and indirect speech (the <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> in the form of explanation in the table, chancing the sentences and rewriting the sentences), relative pronoun (the <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> in the form of filling in the blank), thinking verbs, feeling verbs and verbs of senses (the <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> in the form of giving explanation in the table, and finding in the blank), adverb of manner, place, and time (the <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> in the form of giving explanation), action verbs (the <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> the form of translating the words), connectors (the <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> in the form of completing the paragraph and giving more examples), imperatives (the <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> in the form of giving the information), linking verbs (the <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> the form of giving information and changing the sentences), qualitative adjectives (the <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> in the form of finding the antonym), order of adjectives (the <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> in the form of giving information and completing the sentences), relating verbs (the <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> in the form of giving explanation), degree of comparison (the <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> in the form of giving explanation and comparing picture), passive voice and manner in passive (the <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> in the form of giving explanation, changing the words and the sentences). ...|$|R

5|$|A {{study in}} 1971–72 found that {{although}} Cleveland's crime rate {{was significantly lower}} than other large urban areas, most Cleveland residents feared crime. In the 1980s, gang <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> on the rise, associated with crack cocaine.

5|$|All major {{forecasting}} agencies predicted an above-average season. All {{reduced their}} seasonal predictions in early August, {{but even the}} revised predictions were too high. The lack of <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> primarily caused by an unexpected significant weakening of the Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation between winter and spring. This resulted in continuation of the spring weather pattern over the Atlantic Ocean, with strong vertical wind shear, mid-level moisture, and atmospheric stability, which suppressed tropical cyclogenesis.|$|E

5|$|All rock now {{exposed in}} the area of the park is volcanic, but this has not always been the case. For {{hundreds}} of millions of years, the Lassen region underwent repeated uplifting to form mountains, only to have them worn down and submerged under encroaching seas. During the periods of submersion, sand, mud and limestone were deposited. Occasionally volcanic <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> associated with the mountain building.|$|E
5|$|Captured {{resistance}} {{members were}} also {{executed by the}} German authorities.

40|$|Serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> {{a marker}} of {{oxidative}} stress and <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> associated with cardiovascular disease. Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) is a noninvasive predictor of atherosclerosis. We investigated the association between serum GGT activity and carotid IMT. Fifty-five persons who had normal liver function tests were consecutively enrolled. Carotid IMT was evaluated in {{the right and left}} common carotid arteries. The averaged values of carotid IMT and serum GGT <b>activity</b> <b>were</b> compared. Serum GGT activity correlated with carotid IMT (r. 396, P. 003). Serum GGT <b>activities</b> <b>were</b> increased in patients with carotid intimal hyperplasia compared with those without intimal hyperplasia (20. 3 + 11. 2 vs 34. 3 + 16. 1 U/L; P. 001). Serum GGT <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> associated with carotid IMT. This finding supports the concept that elevated serum GGT <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> {{a marker of}} atherosclerosis...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the ANC {{held to the}} belief that its primary <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> {{political}} organising, and that any cultural <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> secondary to this. This belief began to shift with the establishment of the Mayibuye Cultural Ensemble in 1975, and the Amandla Cultural Ensemble later in the 1970s. Mayibuye was established as a growing number of ANC activists argued that cultural events needed to form a part of their work, and could be used to raise awareness of apartheid, gather support, and drive political change. The group was established by ANC activists Barry Feinberg and Ronnie Kasrils, who named it after the slogan Mayibuye iAfrika (Let Africa Return). The group consisted of several South African performers, and used a mixture of songs, poetry, and narrative in their performance, which described life under the apartheid government and their struggle against it. The songs were often performed in three- or four-part harmony. The group performed more than 200 times across Europe, and were seen as the cultural arm of the ANC. The group experienced personal and organisational difficulties, and disbanded in 1980.|$|E
5|$|In {{the time}} after Burebista's death {{and between the}} rule of Domitian and Tiberius, Dacian <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> minimal. The Dacians were forced into a {{defensive}} state where their main <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> keeping the Romans out of Dacian territories. The regional factions that remained posed no substantial threat to the Roman empire and the Roman sources themselves stop mentioning plans of Roman invasion during this time. Dacian power, resurged during the reigns of Duras – who reigned 68–87 AD – and peaked {{during the reign of}} Decebalus – who reigned from 85/87-106 AD. By this time the Dacian tribes had united once more, under the ruler of Decebalus, and again posed a threat to Rome.|$|E
