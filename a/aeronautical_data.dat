The Wrights designed the wings with camber, a curvature of the top surface. The brothers did not discover this principle, but took advantage of it. The better lift of a cambered surface compared to a flat one was first discussed scientifically by Sir George Cayley. Lilienthal, whose work the Wrights carefully studied, used cambered wings in his gliders, proving in flight the advantage over flat surfaces.|$|E

40|$|Pressure drags, {{obtained}} from measured pressure distributions in the transonic and low-supersonic speed range, are compared for sharp and blunt leading-edged two-dimensional aerofoils. For the special blunt shapes considered here, the high pressures in the stagnation-point region are offset by low pressures generated further round {{on the leading}} edge and on the basic aerofoil itself. The result is that the changes in pressure drag due to blunting are small and in some cases favourable. 1. Introduction. It is often assumed that the effect of blunting the leading edge of a sharp aerofoil section, or increasing the leading-edge size of an already blunt section, inevitably leads to an increase in wave drag at supersonic freestream speeds.

40|$|International audienceDue to {{both the}} {{constant}} increase in air traffic and the migration of air–ground communications from analog voice to digital data, the current, emerging and future communication systems are facing a tremendous challenge: to provide efficient links with suitable capacity, availability and integrity. The aviation industry and airlines are expecting researchers, engineers and technicians to define, design, deploy and maintain current and future aeronautical systems dedicated to air–ground data link communications, but even well-trained researchers, engineers and technicians in current ground networks and their protocol architectures may have a lack of background information on the specific properties and constraints of the aeronautical environment and its organization, {{when they have to}} address aeronautical communication networks.

This study is placed in today's context which sees the first generation of Aeronautical Mobile Satellite System (AMSS) being gradually but restrictively put into service in oceanic airspaces with low air-traffic density. This paper first discusses the case of ATS dedicated versus mixed (ATS and commercial) Comms service provision and identifies the specific ATS comms requirements context. Specific emphasis is put on the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) standardization framework for both the ATN (Aeronautical Telecommunication Network) and the SSR (Secondary Surveillance Radar) Mode S specific services. An architectural system and network design for a future SDLS is then proposed, such as to meet the ATS comms requirements within the realm of existing technologies. To minimize development risk and cost, consideration is given to re-use the ESA-developed Land Mobile Communication Technology, known as MSBN (Mobile Satellite Business Network) featuring distinct subnetworks. It is particularly suited to an ATM (Air Traffic Management) decentralized architecture made of independent ATC (Air Traffic Control) Centers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{retrospective}} study using probit regression techniques {{was to determine the}} factors that best predicted the career success of Air Force Academy cadets and to develop a predictive equation based on those factors. The Department of Institutional Research at the United States Air Force Academy provided the data for the study. The Department of Institutional Research combined admissions and Academy data maintained at the Air Force Academy with <b>aeronautical</b> status <b>data</b> from the Air Force Personnel Center. The sample included all admitted cadets between the years 1982 and 1999 for which complete data were available. ^ Career success was defined as an additive function that combined years of service and the attainment of the appropriate rank for time served. The definition of success was tailored for each year group. ^ In order to achieve the purposes of the study, three hypotheses were tested. The hypotheses were: (1) admissions variables had a statistically significant impact on the career success of Air Force Academy cadets; (2) Academy variables had a statistically significant impact on the career success of Air Force Academy cadets; and (3) aeronautical status had a statistically significant impact on the career success of Air Force Academy cadets. ^ In order to test the hypotheses, six regressions were computed. The third regression was found to be the most accurate. It was 97. 34 % accurate in predicting which cadets would fail to achieve career success as Air Force officers. It was 12. 50 % accurate in predicting which cadets would achieve career success. The overall accuracy of the third regression was 75. 57 %. ^ These results suggest determinates of the career success of Air Force Academy cadets largely occur after graduation. These results also suggest it is possible to identify those likely not to achieve career success using admissions and Academy variables. Academy leadership may then design and implement interventions to increase the likelihood cadets will achieve career success. Recommendations for the Air Force Academy leadership were proposed based on these results. ...|$|R
