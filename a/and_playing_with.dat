5|$|Baggio was {{not fully}} {{fit for the}} final against Brazil at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, after pulling his {{hamstring}} during the semi-final <b>and</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> {{the aid of a}} painkiller injection. Despite being far less dominant than in previous matches, he still tested Brazilian goalkeeper Cláudio Taffarel and was able to set up a few chances for his teammates. The match ended 0–0 after extra time; he took Italy's last penalty in the resulting shootout, but his kick went over the cross-bar and the Brazilians won the title {{in one of the most}} upsetting moments in World Cup history.|$|E

In 2016, Williams announced his retirement from the music industry after AC/DC's Rock or Bust World Tour.|$|E

He travelled {{to the continent}} to study music, but {{changed his mind and}} decided to focus on literature. He was a talented student and won a scholarship in counterpoint in 1891. The family moved to the suburb of Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire) in 1888, and Synge entered Trinity College, Dublin, the following year.

5|$|As {{the train}} departs towards King's Cross, Rubeus Hagrid waves riders goodbye {{outside of the}} window. Shadows of Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger can also been seen walking down the train corridor, looking for an empty compartment. Following this, Buckbeak flies outside the window, while Hogwarts {{can be seen in}} the background. Shortly after, the train enters a forest where centaurs are running. Upon exiting the forest, Hogwarts can be seen once again in the background. Fred and George Weasley appear, flying broomsticks <b>and</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> fireworks. The Hogwarts Express then enters a tunnel, after which riders find {{themselves}} in the middle of a storm and pass Malfoy Manor. The journey then enters a second tunnel; Harry, Ron, and Hermione appear again in the train corridor. As a spider crawls up the compartment door, Ron eats it and the trio continue to walk on down the corridor. After the tunnel the journey continues into London passing by an industrial factory and then a residential area. The Knight Bus then appears; squeezing between buildings and shrinking to pass under a bridge. As the bus drives away, the train enters King's Cross station, where Alastor Moody greets passengers.|$|E

25|$|Javed Omar was {{the pick}} of the batsmen, scoring 22 before being caught by Marcus Trescothick off the most {{accurate}} of the English bowlers, Simon Jones. With six batsmen out in single figures, only Aftab Ahmed looked in control, before he also edged Andrew Flintoff to slip. In the end, Bangladesh made just 108 in 38.2 overs, despite being boosted by 12 English no-balls – eight from Hoggard, four from Harmison. Few batsmen even displayed the standard practice of getting behind a swinging ball <b>and</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> a straight bat, preferring instead to stay still and nudge at the ball.|$|E
25|$|On 20 October 2010, Bale scored {{his first}} senior hat trick against European champions Inter Milan at the San Siro in the Champions League. Tottenham lost the match 4–3, having been 4–0 down inside the first 35 minutes <b>and</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> ten men for over 80 {{minutes of the}} match after goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes had been sent off in the eighth minute for a {{professional}} foul on Inter's Jonathan Biabiany.

25|$|Rachmaninoff possessed {{extremely}} large hands, {{with which}} he could easily maneuver through the most complex chordal configurations. His left hand technique was unusually powerful. His playing was marked by definition—where other pianists' playing became blurry-sounding from overuse of the pedal or deficiencies in finger technique, Rachmaninoff's textures were always crystal clear. Only Josef Hofmann and Josef Lhévinne shared this kind of clarity with him. All three men had Anton Rubinstein {{as a model for}} this kind of playing—Hofmann as a student of Rubinstein's, Rachmaninoff from hearing his famous series of historical recitals in Moscow while studying with Zverev, and Lhevinne from hearing <b>and</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> him.|$|E

This however, was to prove to be the last ever Beachbuggy show as Jim left shortly after and Jack made the decision not to replace him and to concentrate full-time on new band Walker.|$|E
25|$|Pujara {{was named}} in the 16-man squad for the 2014 tour of England. With a best of 55 {{and a total of}} 222 runs in five Tests, he had a disappointing series. Despite getting good starts, he failed to convert them into big scores, {{struggling}} with his back foot movement <b>and</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> a straighter bat, while also facing difficulty against the seaming ball. He was {{not a part of the}} squad for the ODI series that followed and upon receiving permission from the BCCI, signed for Derbyshire to play in their last three games of the season. After a poor first game, he finished the stint scoring 212 runs, that included an unbeaten 90 in the win over Surrey and an unbeaten century against Leicestershire.|$|E
25|$|Jones {{began playing}} {{organized}} ice hockey with local teams in Denver <b>and</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> travel teams {{when he was}} eight years old.

He played for the Dallas Stars Bantam Major team, scoring 33 points in 31 games. In the 2009 Bantam draft the Everett Silvertips selected Jones eleventh overall. He was projected to be a higher pick in the draft, but concerns that he would choose to play college hockey over the Western Hockey League (WHL) caused him to be selected lower. After being drafted Jones played another season in Dallas, with the Stars U-18 team before joining the NTDP.|$|E

25|$|In modern Israel, early Zionists redefined Lag BaOmer from a rabbinic-oriented celebration to a {{commemoration}} of the Bar Kokhba revolt against the Roman Empire (132–136 CE). According to work published by Yael Zerubavel of Rutgers University, a number of Lag BaOmer traditions were reinterpreted by Zionist ideologues {{to focus on the}} victory of the Bar Kokhba rebels rather than their ultimate defeat at Betar three years later. The plague that decimated Rabbi Akiva's 24,000 disciples was explained as a veiled reference to the revolt; the 33rd day when the plague ended was explained as the day of Bar Kokhba's victory. By the late 1940s, Israeli textbooks for schoolchildren painted Bar Kokhba as the hero while Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and Rabbi Akiva stood on the sidelines, cheering him on. This interpretation lent itself to singing and dancing around bonfires by night to celebrate Bar Kokhba's victory, <b>and</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> bows and arrows by day to remember the actions of Bar Kokhba's rebel forces.|$|E
25|$|In the one-day series again Pakistan in the UAE, BBC Sport {{commentator}} Jonathan Agnew {{stated that}} Hales' technique {{was simply too}} fallible outside off stump, planting his front foot on middle stump <b>and</b> <b>playing</b> <b>with</b> a bat two feet away from his body. Agnew surmised that whilst in 20 and 50 over cricket with no slips Hales {{could get away with}} this issue, in test cricket he could not. In the first three tests in South Africa, Hales' technique was cruelly exposed by their fast-bowling attack. In the first Tests he made scores of 10 and 26, although England {{went on to win the}} game by 241 runs. In a high scoring second Test, Hales made 60 in the first innings but was dismissed for just five in the second. In the third Test, he was out for one in the first innings as England made 323. He was out for 18 in the second innings, as England went onto secure a seven wicket victory. In the final match of the series, he again struggled, and after making 15 in the first innings, he was out for just one in the second innings as England were bowled out for just 101. Despite the heavy defeat, England won the series 2-1.|$|E
