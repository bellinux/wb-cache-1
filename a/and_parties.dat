5|$|The {{reign of}} Leopold II saw {{the rise of}} {{organized}} socialist political groups <b>and</b> <b>parties,</b> most notably among the industrial workers in Wallonia.

5|$|By now the beachhead {{had been}} reinforced; the New Zealand Infantry Brigade, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade had all arrived during the day. Communication {{between the two}} sides {{resulted}} in a more formal truce on 24 May. At 07:30 all firing ceased <b>and</b> <b>parties</b> moved out to bury the dead. This lasted until 16:30 when the truce ended and both sides returned to their own lines. Firing recommenced at 16:45. The Turkish commanders now realised just what would be required to capture the beachhead. Instead of trying again they left two of their depleted divisions, the 16th and 19th, to man their lines while the others were withdrawn. The still independent 77th Infantry Regiment also remained behind, in the same position covering the south.|$|E

5|$|A Company—now under Lieutenant Lawrence Clark {{following}} Chitts' wounding that afternoon—had {{only just}} succeeded in breaking contact from the Chinese, suffering a number killed and wounded during a confused withdrawal. Meanwhile, B Company {{had also been}} forced to fight its way down the hill. Both companies were now well clear of their former positions and {{would have had a}} hard time fighting their way back. Ultimately {{it was too late for}} the Australians to regain the feature in darkness, and the weight of the Chinese attack continued to mount. Only D Company on the southern right flank—which had been left unmolested—was able to regain its previous position on Hill 63. Meanwhile, the positions previously occupied by A and B Companies were occupied by the Chinese in superior numbers, and the remainder of 3 RAR concentrated at the railway crossing instead. At 22:00 Coad arranged to shell and mortar the relinquished ridge, while a standing patrol from the Middlesex was posted on the south-western side of the Maenjung-dong pass in anticipation of a renewed Chinese attack. However, following heavy fighting the pressure on the Australians unexpectedly ceased after midnight, <b>and</b> <b>parties</b> of Chinese were observed beginning to withdraw.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, the 150th {{anniversary of}} Alexander Pushkin's birth was {{organised}} {{at the hotel}} by the Society of Cultural Relations with the USSR, attended by the Soviet chargé d'affaires, the Polish ambassador, the Romanian minister, and Cecil Day-Lewis, raising Mi5's suspicions that he still had communist sympathies, a contention he later denounced.

S. Eliot, Harold Nicolson, and Edith Sitwell, with a clientele of luminaries such as Ralph Richardson, Elizabeth Taylor, Alfred Hitchcock, and Barbra Streisand. Queen Elizabeth II attended the Dorchester when she was a princess on the day prior to the announcement of her engagement to the Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on 10 July 1947. Prince Philip also held his stag night party at the hotel, which has been documented in a plaque.|$|E
5|$|It {{resulted}} in an overwhelming victory for the right, with the CEDA and the Radicals together winning 219 seats. Although the political situation was complicated, parties of the right won around 3,365,700 votes, parties of the centre 2,051,500 votes, <b>and</b> <b>parties</b> of the left 3,118,000 according to one estimate. Turnout was around 8,535,200 votes, 67.5% of the electorate. The right had spent far more on their election campaign than the Socialists, who campaigned alone. Women, in their first election, mainly voted for the centre-right. The Communist Party, with perhaps 3,000 members, were at this point not significant. Nationalist Basques won twelve of seventeen Basque seats, a considerable victory. Keeping their promise, the CNT proclaimed a revolution. There were many reasons the Socialists and Republicans lost out; the female vote alone cannot explain the shift. Among them was the disunity of the political left compared to the right, {{in a system that}} favoured broad coalitions. The Radicals and their supporters had also shifted to the right. Abstentionalism hindered Socialist and Republican candidates. Overall, the political system in Spain had changed dramatically since the last election.|$|E
5|$|Unhappy in {{the estate}} agency, Kingsbury took up the {{position}} of caretaker on a farm at Boundary Bend, {{not far from where}} Avery was working. After three months, the pair decided that they would go on an adventure – walking through western Victoria and New South Wales. In February 1936, Kingsbury and Avery left their jobs and began travelling north, working on various farms and estates. The pair eventually arrived in Sydney several months later, and returned to Melbourne on the first train back. Kingsbury resumed working as a real estate agent, while Avery worked as a nurseryman. They spent their free time at dances <b>and</b> <b>parties.</b> During this time, Kingsbury met and became close to Leila Bradbury. As the war in Europe escalated, Kingsbury and Avery made up their minds to enlist. Despite his parents' disapproval, Kingsbury signed up to the Australian Imperial Force on 29 May 1940.|$|E

5|$|Cristina Kirchner is {{considered}} to be a populist leader and, like other contemporary populists in Latin America, built a system of propaganda to legitimize her actions: the Relato K. This propaganda works around a number of usual themes: the glorification of the state to the detriment of the individual rights; use of conspiracy theories to explain mistakes as attacks from others; blaming neoliberalism for the poverty; and glorifying democracy in speeches while maintaining only the appearance of it (procedural democracy). The political world is divided in two halves, the people and those against the people, with the Kirchners described as the saviors of the people. Under this vision, the people are treated like a homogeneous group, with a unified collective will, that the leader interprets beyond the boundaries of parliaments <b>and</b> <b>parties.</b> Kirchnerite writer Ernesto Laclau considers this the perfect form of democracy. This division is used to justify the rejection of those described as being against the people, and to polarize the population. The problems caused by her policies, such as inflation, are always explained as the result of class conflict and imperialism. Economic activity is described as a zero-sum game, where any wealth is the result of the exploitation of someone else, which justifies economic interventionism. Kirchner's victory in the 2011 election was used to justify authoritarian policies, as those policies would be the general will; opposition and criticism was often described as antidemocratic or even as the plotting of a coup d'état. Laclau's vision of the people has been criticized by other writers because it left little room for opposition or criticism, and because the citizen is actually reduced to a mere spectator unable to contest government policies.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the events}} of September 11, Bush issued an {{executive}} order authorizing the President's Surveillance Program which included allowing the NSA to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U.S <b>and</b> <b>parties</b> within the U.S. without obtaining a warrant {{as required by the}} Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. As of 2009, the other provisions of the program remained highly classified. Once the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel questioned its original legal opinion that FISA did not apply in a time of war, the program was subsequently re-authorized by the President on the basis that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists. The program proved to be controversial, as critics of the administration, as well as organizations such as the American Bar Association, argued that it was illegal. In August 2006, a U.S. district court judge ruled that the NSA electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional, but on July 6, 2007, that ruling was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit {{on the grounds that the}} plaintiffs lacked standing. On January 17, 2007, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U.S. Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President, but would be subjected to judicial oversight. Later in 2007, the NSA launched a replacement for the program, referred to as PRISM, that was subject to the oversight of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. This program was not publicly revealed until reports by The Washington Post and The Guardian emerged in June 2013.|$|E
