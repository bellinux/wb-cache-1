The behaviour of angle bracing members is generally complex since controlled by tension or compression, bending and torsion.

A strut model takes into consideration the effect of brace end connections and softening effect of its force-deformation characteristic.

30|$|The {{means for}} RA {{in our study}} {{were similar to those}} {{reported}} by Grift et al. (2011), but the range of observations extended slightly below 40 ° and above 100 degrees. The environments had no effect on the generation means of RA. This is interesting considering the strong influence of the environment on the other root architecture features. Root angle may be determined relatively early during plant growth, specifically as a response to plant competition within the row, and be less responsive to later environmental conditions. Factors such as differences in soil texture and fertility that were not tested in our study may influence root angles on a population-wide basis, though Troyer (1996) notes that hybrid by soil type interactions on performance of commercial germplasm were not frequently observed. Trachsel et al. (2011) rated brace root angle visually on a scale of 1 – 9 and crown root angle on a scale of 3 – 9 using dug and cleaned root cores from 98 B 73  × Mo 17 derived RILs, a subset of the inter-mated B 73  × Mo 17 (IBM) population, evaluated in three environments. They reported that the most repeatable root architecture trait for the IBM population in their study was crown root angle at 67 %. As our method for calculating RA does not involve removing brace roots, it can be understood more as a brace root angle measurement, though lines and hybrids are known to differ in the number of nodes they form brace roots from, which can influence the root angle calculation. Our RA measure is one of root topology, regardless of whether crown or brace roots form the outer perimeter of a root system. Across a larger set of RILs chosen for root architecture diversity, the Spearman-rank correlation between brace and crown root angle in Trachsel et al. (2011) was about 0.5. While brace root angle may differ from crown root <b>angle,</b> <b>brace</b> roots comprise the bulk of post-embryonic root biomass at maturity (Fig.  1), so root angle measurements based on them may be more related to other traits of interest.|$|E
40|$|The {{accurate}} {{prediction of}} stress concentration factors (SCF) at weld toes is recognised {{as one of}} the most important factors in the design, against fatigue failure, of welded tubular joints in offshore structures. The objectives of this work are i) to study the influence of some important tubular joint and weld profile geometric parameters on the elastic SCFs at weld toes, ii) compare these values with strains which could be measured by strain gauges, and iii) to determine plastic-elastic strain distributions after local yielding has occurred in the weld. Using 3 -d frozen-stress, photoelastic techniques elastic SCFs were determined in non-overlapped corner K joints in balanced axial loading and in X joints in axial loading. For typical tube parameters, results have been obtained for different brace angles, brace spacings, weld size, weld angle and weld toe radii in the crown and saddle planes at the brace and chord wall ends of the weld. They have been presented as the product of a shell SCF Ks and a notch SCF Kn. Ks, which was measured at the weld toe, depends on position in the brace intersection, brace <b>angle,</b> <b>brace</b> spacing and weld size. Kn depends on weld toe radius, weld angle and weld size. Large scale 2 -d photoelastic and finite element models were used to study the influence of weld profile "qualities" on Ks and Kn. Weld shapes conforming with minimum profiling requirements are called "uncontrolled". Improved weld shapes wi th concave profiles are called "controlled". The reductions in SCFs, due to the different profiles, depend on position (crown or saddle) when the results are presented for identical weld geometry. Plastic-elastic and residual plastic strains were obtained in 2 -d steel weldments using reflection photoelasticity and moire interferometry experimental techniques. A moire interferometer, using Helium-Neon laser light and high sensitivity diffraction gratings was designed and built for this purpose. Strains were measured in the range 20 µε to 2 %.

This brace, when finally adjusted is called Chêneau light™ brace. The advantage of this new bracing system is that the brace is available immediately, is easily adjustable and that it can also be easily modified. This avoids construction periods of sometimes more than 6 weeks, where the curve may drastically increase during periods of fast growth. The disadvantage of this bracing system {{is that there is a}} wide variability of possibilities to arrange the different shells during adjustment. Results The Cobb angle in the whole group was reduced by an average of 16, 4 °, which corresponds to a correction effect of 51 %. The differences were highly significant in the T-test (T = 17, 4; p Conclusions The use of the Chêneau light™ brace leads to correction effects above average when compared to correction effects of other braces described in literature. The reduction of material seems to increase patient's comfort and reduces the stress patients may suffer from whilst in the brace. 80 % of the adolescent population of scoliosis patients can be braced with the Chêneau light™ brace. In certain patterns of curvature and in the younger population with an age of less than 11 years, other approaches have to be used, such as plaster based bracing or the application of CAD/CAM based orthoses. </p...|$|E

This causes the load applied to the member to be eccentric with respect to both the principal axes. The major objective {{of this research is}} to prepare an analytical model for failure loads under geometric and material nonlinearity. Two hundred and forty cases of steel single angles eccentrically loaded through two bolts at each end in one leg have been analyzed by the finite element model using the ABAQUS ver 5. 6 software package. A Newtonian approach with eight-node thick shell reduced integration elements has been employed for the nonlinear solution. The research included the study of the effects of gauge distance, slenderness ratio, and out-of-straightness on the failure loads. In lieu of a pre-processor, program code was written for data input into the FEA package. Several combinations of in-plane and out-of-plane out-of-straightnesses were studied to get the particular combination resulting in the most conservative failure load. With this, the program was then run with different mesh sizes to get the convergence. The program was then incorporated with the desired mesh size. Thereafter, the FEA model developed was validated by comparing with the test results obtained from previous research. Once the model has been successfully validated, it was used to generate tables of compressive resistances using a number of angle sizes with varying gauge distances, slenderness ratios, widths of connected leg, and out-of-straightnesses. The compressive resistance values calculated from the Canadian Standard CSA S 37 - 94 2 ̆ 2 Antennas, Towers, and Antenna-Supporting Structures 2 ̆ 2 are compared with those obtained from FEA model and found to be conservative.
