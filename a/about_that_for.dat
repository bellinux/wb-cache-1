500|$|The album's {{title track}} was said by band members {{to be the}} {{continuation}} of [...] "Final Six", which was an outtake from their previous album. [...] "Final Six" [...] origins deal with the apocalypse. [...] "Human Strain" [...] deals with apocalyptic origins as well. The track was explained by guitarist Jeff Hanneman to initially be about the human race dying off by a mutative disease. The title of [...] "Public Display of Dismemberment" [...] refers to the consequences that countries outside of the United States give to citizens for crimes. Tom Araya said that [...] "Unit 731" [...] is [...] "very similar to Josef Mengele {{in the sense that}} it was a medical unit in the military, which was a Japanese military unit, actually. They did kind of the same thing; they tested the limits of the human body and recorded it for scientific purposes." [...] "Playing With Dolls" [...] is about a child witnessing a serial killer. [...] "Beauty Through Order" [...] is about Elizabeth Báthory, the most prolific female serial killer. Jeff Hanneman explained: [...] "I've been meaning to write a song <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> a long time. I couldn't figure out the angle, I was thinking, 'How does a woman write? I can't write like a woman I'm a guy!' Then I just figured, 'Well, she's evil; she has lots of power and killed people.' So I just started writing and the lyrics and they came out." [...] Slayer revealed to Revolver that the track [...] "Snuff" [...] has no lyrical concept. [...] "Psychopathy Red" [...] was inspired by the Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo.|$|E

No, I'm not at all sure <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> <b>For</b> one thing, if they really wanted to do something useful, they could devote their prayer time and energy to some pressing project that they can do something about.|$|E

2500|$|When Andrew Marr asked Corbyn [...] "do you regard {{yourself}} as a Marxist?", Corbyn responded by saying: [...] "That {{is a very interesting}} question actually. I haven't thought <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> a long time. I haven't really read as much of Marx as we should have done. I have read quite a bit but not that much." [...] Similarly, defending John McDonnell's statement that there is [...] "a lot to learn" [...] from Karl Marx's book Das Kapital, Corbyn described Marx as a [...] "great economist".|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked if}} he {{regarded}} himself as a Marxist, Corbyn responded by saying: [...] "That {{is a very interesting}} question actually. I haven't thought <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> a long time. I haven't really read as much of Marx as we should have done. I have read quite a bit but not that much." [...] Similarly, defending John McDonnell's statement that there is [...] "a lot to learn" [...] from Karl Marx's book Das Kapital, Corbyn described Marx as a [...] "great economist". Corbyn has said he has read some of the works of Adam Smith, Karl Marx and David Ricardo and has [...] "looked at many, many others." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tensions {{were also}} {{mounting}} within the band. Albini did not drink alcohol, so Riley and Durango became drinking buddies {{on the road}} while Albini was doing interviews and handling the band's logistics. Riley, however, was drinking to excess, and his behavior ruined several of the band's performances. Albini accused Riley {{of a number of}} other shortcomings including lateness to rehearsals, always needing rides, and [...] "flashes of brilliance offset by flashes of belligerence." [...] However, though he made a number of threats, Albini never fired Riley. Another problem facing the band was that Riley was now in college and both Albini and Durango had to keep day jobs, which limited Big Black's ability to tour. When Durango announced that he intended to enter law school beginning in the fall semester of 1987, the band decided to keep going until he began school and then call it quits. Despite enjoying increased press, radio airplay, record sales, and concert fees, the band did not regret their decision and eschewed the idea of commercial success. According to Riley, [...] "Big Black was never <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> <b>For</b> Big Black to make any money, it wouldn't have been Big Black anymore." [...] Being a lame duck band was also liberating, as the members no longer had to be concerned with the group's future. Albini wrote that he was happy to be breaking up the band before it grew too big: ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{original}} album's lukewarm sales and reception, Rowland re-entered recording studios to collect new songs for a reissue of Ms. Kelly, including production by Stargate, Jeff Dawson, CKB and Mark Feist. She was {{also expected to}} record with producer Danja, but deadline pressure prevented from happening; a new track by J. R. Rotem {{did not make the}} final cut. [...] "The sales weren't as good as I wanted them to be and to be honest, I did feel sad <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> a little while", Rowland stated in 2008, still blaming the final track listing for too many midtempos and ballads. [...] "I didn't realize it while I was recording it. After it was released [...] many fans said the songs would rock if they were more upbeat." [...] Branded with the title Ms. Kelly: Diva Deluxe, the United States re-release received a digital download release only on March 25, 2008, containing seven tracks — five new songs and two remixes of songs found from the standard edition of the album. The international edition of the Ms. Kelly re-release was released physically and digitally in May 2008, retitled as Ms. Kelly: Deluxe Edition. It removed eight tracks from {{the original}} release and replaced them with six of the seven Diva Deluxe tracks, as Rowland [...] "wanted to have another view on the record and close the Ms. Kelly chapter" [...] with the re-release. Previously unreleased song [...] "Daylight", a Bobby Womack cover and collaboration with Travie McCoy of Gym Class Heroes, served as the reissue's new lead single.|$|E
2500|$|With {{almost the}} entire team {{returning}} for the 2012–13 season, expectations were high, and the Bears were ranked #13 in the AP pre-season poll, their highest ranking since 2009. The Bears more than {{lived up to the}} expectations, compiling a 32-4 season record, and ending the regular season with a #6 ranking. The highlight of the regular season was a 67-55 road victory over arch-rival and perennial women's basketball power #4 ranked Stanford. Cal's victory broke an 81-game conference winning streak for the Cardinal. Gottlieb led the Bears to a 17-1 conference record, making them Pac-12 Conference co-Champions—the first conference championship in California Women's Basketball history. The Bears earned a second seed in the NCAA tournament, the Bears' highest tournament seed ever. They defeated Fresno State 90-76 in the first round, and downed South Florida in overtime to advance to the Sweet Sixteen {{for only the second time}} in school history. The Bears beat LSU to advance to the Elite Eight for the first time, and then earned their first trip to the Final Four trip with a thrilling 65-62 overtime victory over Andy Landers' Georgia Bulldogs at the Spokane Arena in Spokane, WA. [...] A tough loss to Louisville in the national semifinal game concluded the team's extraordinary season. [...] "What I said to our team in the locker room is that we can be disappointed about a half a basketball that we wish we had back. We could be disappointed to not be playing on Tuesday night," [...] Gottlieb said. [...] "But I'm going to think <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> two minutes, and for the next 10,000 minutes I'm going to think about what this group did for the University of California." ...|$|E
