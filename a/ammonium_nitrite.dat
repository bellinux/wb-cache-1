The steady state analysis allowed the construction of practical diagrams that show the effect of operating conditions (dilution rate and ammonium feed concentration) as well as kinetic parameters on the performance of the bioreactor.

This study evaluates the impact of abattoir wastes on microbial <b>ammonium</b> and <b>nitrite</b> consumptions in a tropical fresh water ecosystem. Samples were collected from points (source point, upstream and downstream) about 300 m apart. Autotrophic and heterotrophic <b>ammonium</b> and <b>nitrite</b> consumptions were estimated by incorporation of allyl thiourea and sodium chlorate, inhibitors of autotrophic <b>ammonium</b> and <b>nitrite</b> oxidations, respectively. Source point sample was the most turbid, richer in nutrients and microbial populations than the upstream and downstream samples. <b>Ammonium</b> and <b>nitrite</b> consumption patterns were active at the upstream and downstream stations. Autotrophic ammonium consumption was completely repressed while autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrite consumptions were very active at the source point. Correlations between <b>ammonium</b> and <b>nitrite</b> consumptions at the various sampling points were negative (r = - 0. 96) for autotrophs at the source point, and positive (0. 96 4 + -N h - 1, observed upstream while {{the highest rate of}} heterotrophic nitrite consumption was 122. 917 g NO 2 -N h - 1, observed at the source point.

40|$|A major {{percentage}} of fixed nitrogen (N) {{loss in the}} oceans occurs within nitrite-rich oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) via denitrification and anammox. It remains unclear to what extent <b>ammonium</b> and <b>nitrite</b> oxidation co-occur, either supplying or competing for substrates involved in nitrogen loss in the OMZ core. Assessment of the oxygen (O 2) sensitivity of these processes down to the O 2 concentrations present in the OMZ core (< 10 nmol⋅L− 1) is therefore essential for understanding and modeling nitrogen loss in OMZs. We determined rates of <b>ammonium</b> and <b>nitrite</b> oxidation in the seasonal OMZ off Concepcion, Chile at manipulated O 2 levels between 5 nmol⋅L− 1 and 20 μmol⋅L− 1. Rates of both processes were detectable in the low nanomolar range (5 – 33 nmol⋅L− 1 O 2), but demonstrated a strong dependence on O 2 concentrations with apparent half-saturation constants (Kms) of 333 ± 130 nmol⋅L− 1 O 2 for ammonium oxidation and 778 ± 168 nmol⋅L− 1 O 2 for nitrite oxidation assuming one-component Michaelis–Menten kinetics. Nitrite oxidation rates, however, were better described with a two-component Michaelis–Menten model, indicating a high-affinity component with a Km {{of just a few}} nanomolar. As the communities of <b>ammonium</b> and <b>nitrite</b> oxidizers were similar to other OMZs, these kinetics should apply across OMZ systems. The high O 2 affinities imply that <b>ammonium</b> and <b>nitrite</b> oxidation can occur within the OMZ core whenever O 2 is supplied, for example, by episodic intrusions. These processes therefore compete with anammox and denitrification for <b>ammonium</b> and <b>nitrite,</b> thereby exerting an important control over nitrogen loss...|$|R

The <b>ammonium</b> and <b>nitrite</b> were attracted and grown on the surfaces of the rotating anode and cathode pole-plates, respectively, as ions in the water were driven by the electropotential force. The high density of <b>ammonium</b> and <b>nitrite</b> adhered to the pole-plates surfaces was first drawing off by the scrape stick and then removed away from the water, and the goal of water purifying was eventually achieved. The experimental results demonstrated that the machine constructed using the graphite and the stainless steel for the anode and cathode, respectively, and operated under the pole-plates conditions with the rotating speed 60 rpm, distance 20 mm, and the direct electric voltage between 100 and 200 V, obtained a better performance of scraping off both of the <b>ammonium</b> and <b>nitrite</b> as the scrape stick was made by the hard rubber and the wastewater pumped into the treating tank was mixed with disturbance.
