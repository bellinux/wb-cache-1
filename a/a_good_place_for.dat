5|$|The Liberals and PC party {{differed}} considerably on {{fiscal and}} tax policies. In his opening campaign speech at Massey Hall in Toronto, Diefenbaker contended that Canadians were overtaxed {{in the amount}} of $120 per family of four. Diefenbaker pledged to reduce taxes and castigated the Liberals for not reducing taxes despite the government surplus. St. Laurent also addressed tax policy in his opening speech, in Winnipeg. St. Laurent noted that since 1953, tax rates had declined, as had the national debt, and that Canada had a reputation as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> investments. The Prime Minister argued that the cost of campaign promises made by the Progressive Conservatives would inevitably drive up the tax rate. Diefenbaker also assailed tight-money monetary policies which kept interest rates high, complaining that they were hitting Atlantic and Western Canada hard.|$|E
5|$|Juan de Chávez {{headed for}} the Valley of Maniani, which had been {{proposed}} by Cerezeda as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> a new town. It {{is likely that the}} Spanish chose the Indian town of Maniani as the location for the new Spanish settlement. On 20 July 1536, Pedro de Alvarado sent instructions to found the new city, to be called Gracias a Dios, to provide better communication between Honduras and Guatemala. Pedro de Alvarado used the town of Tencoa as a base of operations, and sent his brother Gonzalo with 40 Spanish soldiers, and an unspecified number of indigenous allies, to help establish the new town. Alvarado appointed the members of the town council, and assigned 100 Spanish citizens to inhabit it. The natives around Gracias a Dios where not completely subjugated, however, and there were violent indigenous rebellions in the province until around 1539. As at San Pedro, Alvarado annulled all previous encomiendas in the region and reassigned them. Gonzalo de Alvarado had been exploring the central region around Siguatepeque, the Tinto River and Yoro, successfully dealing with native resistance and collecting supplies for San Pedro. He had about a dozen cavalry and fifteen or so infantry under his command, and joined up with ten more soldiers under Gaspar Xuárez de Ávila, who was to serve as his lieutenant. They proceed to Gracias a Dios with the legal documentation establishing its formal existence.|$|E

500|$|Cotton {{had been}} deeply complicit in the {{controversy}} because his theological views differed {{from those of}} the other ministers in New England, and he suffered in attempting to remain supportive of Hutchinson while being conciliatory towards his fellow ministers. [...] Nevertheless, some of his followers were taking his singular doctrine and carrying it well beyond Puritan orthodoxy. [...] Cotton attempted to downplay the appearance of colonial discord when communicating with his brethren in England. A group of colonists made a return trip to England in February 1637, and Cotton asked them to report that the controversy was about magnifying the grace of God, one party focused on grace within man, the other on grace toward man, and that New England was still <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> new colonists.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after Fuller's death, her {{importance}} faded. Her obituary in {{the newspaper}} she had once edited, the Daily Tribune, said that her works had a few great sentiments, [...] "but as a whole they must commend themselves mainly by their vigor of thought and habitual fearlessness rather than freedom of utterance". As biographer Abby Slater wrote, [...] "Margaret had been demoted {{from a position of}} importance in her own right to one in which her only importance was in the company she kept". Years later, Hawthorne's son Julian wrote, [...] "The majority of readers will, I think, not be inconsolable that poor Margaret Fuller has at last taken her place with the numberless other dismal frauds who fill the limbo of human pretension and failure." [...] In the 20th century, American writer Elizabeth Hardwick, former wife of Robert Lowell, wrote an essay called [...] "The Genius of Margaret Fuller" [...] (1986). She compared her own move from Boston to New York to Fuller's, saying that Boston was not <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> intellectuals, despite the assumption that it was the best place for intellectuals.|$|E
500|$|... "Go Big or Go Home" [...] {{received}} critical acclaim, {{with several}} critics particularly complimenting the [...] "Swanson Pyramid of Greatness" [...] joke. HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall said the episode {{was effective in}} appealing to both new and old viewers, developing various character subplots and establishing the harvest festival story arc. He also praised the performances of Chris and Ann, which he called a far better and more interesting pairing than Ann with Mark Brendanawicz. Linda Holmes of NPR suggested the season premiere was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> newcomers to the series to start watching. She said all the characters were funny and the two new cast members had been seamlessly integrated into the show. Time magazine writer James Poniewozik called the episode an [...] "excellent start" [...] to the season, and said the harvest festival subplot would help better focus the series by giving the characters a single goal. Poniewozki said it also [...] "reminds us that the show is about something: the idea, maybe quaint-seeming in this political climate, that civil servants can actually see themselves as servants and work in their community's interest". Damian Holbrook of TV Guide said [...] "Go Big or Go Home" [...] was an improvement on an already strong second season, claiming [...] "the comedy seemed snappier, the relationships better grounded and the ensemble cast at their best." ...|$|E
