During her service in the War of 1812, President was armed with <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> 55guns: thirty-two 24-pounder (10.9kg) cannon, twenty-two 42-pounder (19kg) carronades, and one 18-pounder (8kg) long gun.|$|E
5|$|The Old Blockhouse {{was built}} {{as part of}} this {{programme}} of work. The blockhouse was positioned on high ground to protect the Old Grimsby harbour, overlooking both the harbour and the nearby anchorage of St Helen's Pool. When complete, it would have held <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> two to three guns, which could have fired on targets attempting to enter the harbour, or engaged ships approaching the Scilly Isles from the north-east.|$|E
5|$|The brigade's {{other units}} were the 3rd Airlanding Anti-Tank Battery from the Royal Artillery, the 3rd Parachute Squadron of the Royal Engineers and the 224th (Parachute) Field Ambulance from the Royal Army Medical Corps. During {{operations}} the artillery support {{available to the}} brigade would also include <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> howitzers from the 53rd (Worcester Yeomanry) Airlanding Light Regiment, {{although it was not}} part of the brigade.|$|E

5|$|When Malta {{became a}} British {{protectorate}} in 1800, Fort Manoel was officially {{taken over by}} the British military that September. In the late 19th century, the echaugettes on the bastions facing Valletta were dismantled to make way for gun emplacements. Later on, significant alterations were made to St. Anthony Bastion, when its gunpowder magazine was demolished to make way for <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> three QF 12-pounder guns.|$|E
50|$|By 1939, {{with war}} looming, the BMA, with <b>a</b> single <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> coastal artillery, {{did not allow}} full use {{to be made of}} the {{available}} coloured manpower of Bermuda, even with the construction that year <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> two 6-inch guns at Warwick Camp.|$|R
50|$|Given {{their limited}} displacement, the Indiana class had {{formidable}} armament for the time: four 13-inch guns, <b>an</b> intermediate <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> eight 8-inch guns and <b>a</b> secondary <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> four 6-inch guns, twenty Hotchkiss 6-pounders, and six Maxim-Nordenfelt 1-pounders, {{as well as}} six 18 inch (450 mm) tubes.|$|R
50|$|Often, ships {{have had}} <b>a</b> main <b>battery</b> for {{offensive}} purposes, and a secondary {{and sometimes even}} a tertiary (or more) battery for self-defense. An example of this was the , which carried <b>a</b> main <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> eight 380 mm guns, <b>a</b> secondary <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> twelve 150 mm guns for defense against destroyers and torpedo boats, as well as <b>a</b> tertiary <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> various anti-aircraft guns ranging in caliber from 105 to 20 mm. Many later ships used dual-purpose guns to combine the functions <b>of</b> the secondary <b>battery</b> and the heavier guns <b>of</b> the tertiary <b>batteries,</b> {{in order to simplify}} the design.|$|R
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> BM-13-16 {{launchers}} included four firing vehicles, two reload {{trucks and}} two technical support trucks, with each firing vehicle having {{a crew of}} six. Reloading was executed in 3–4 minutes, although the standard procedure was {{to switch to a}} new position some 10km away due to the ease with which the battery could be identified by the enemy. Three batteries were combined into a division (company), and three divisions into a separate mine-firing regiment of rocket artillery.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} tests {{that can be used}} to test the {{function}} of the thyroid, for the presence of diseases, and for the success or failure of treatment. Blood tests in general aim to measure thyroid function or determine the cause of thyroid dysfunction. Thyroid function tests include <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> blood tests including the measurement of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4, as well as the measurement of TSH. They may reveal hyperthyroidism (high T3 and T4), hypothyroidism (low T3, T4), or subclinical hyperthyroidism (normal T3 and T4 with a low TSH).|$|E
5|$|A ship of {{the line}} was a large, unarmored wooden sailing ship which mounted <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> up to 120 smoothbore guns and carronades. The ship {{of the line}} {{developed}} gradually over centuries and, apart from growing in size, it changed little between the adoption of line of battle tactics in the early 17th century {{and the end of}} the sailing battleship's heyday in the 1830s. From 1794, the alternative term 'line of battle ship' was contracted (informally at first) to 'battle ship' or 'battleship'.|$|E
5000|$|The Adventure-class {{ship was}} {{a class of}} eight 44-gun sailing two-decker {{warships}} of the Royal Navy, classed as a fifth rate like a frigate, but carrying two complete decks <b>of</b> guns, <b>a</b> lower <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> 18-pounders and <b>an</b> upper <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> 12-pounders. This enabled the vessel to deliver a broadside of 318 pounds.|$|R

5|$|After {{consultation}} with Admiralty, Adams {{took advantage of}} this freedom to make four substantive changes to the Tartar design. The ship's wheel was moved from behind the mizzen mast to before it to improve the helmsman's line of sight. The tiller was also relocated, from an exposed position on the quarterdeck to a safer location belowdecks and near the stern. The vessel's hawseholes were relocated from the lower to the upper deck to allow additional storage space inside the hull. Finally, {{in recognition of the}} vessel's likely role in chasing small enemy craft, the leading pair of gunports were moved from the sides of the vessel to the bow in order to form <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> chase guns.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Kekewich's troops {{consisted}} of four companies of the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment, some Royal Engineers, six RML 2.5 inch mountain guns and two machine guns.

Eight Maxim machine guns were mounted on redoubts built atop tailing heaps around the town.|$|E
5|$|Convair's {{proposal}} {{gained an}} order for two prototypes in late 1951. Twelve production aircraft were ordered before a prototype had even flown. No armament was ever fitted to any Sea Dart built, but {{the plan was to}} arm the production aircraft with four 20mm Colt Mk12 cannon and <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> folding-fin unguided rockets. Four of this order were redesignated as service test vehicles, and an additional eight production aircraft were soon ordered as well.|$|E

5|$|During {{the day on}} September 3, Coulter and the KMAG {{advisers}} {{continued to}} clash with the ROK 3rd Division commander, who repeatedly attempted to withdraw his troops against their orders. That night, September 3/4, {{the remainder of the}} ROK I Corps front collapsed. Three North Korean T-34 tanks overran <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> ROK artillery and then scattered two battalions of the newly arrived ROK 5th Regiment. Following a mortar preparation, the North Koreans entered An'gang-ni at 0220. An hour later the command post of the Capital Division withdrew from the town and fighting became increasingly confused. American units disengaged and withdrew and by nightfall, North Koreans held the town and began advancing southward along the railroad.|$|E
5|$|During the interregnum {{following}} the English Civil War, the Old Blockhouse {{was occupied by}} the Royalists and it was attacked by the Parliamentary forces of Sir Robert Blake in 1651. Blake's naval guns out-ranged those of the fort, and, after fierce fighting, the blockhouse was taken. <b>A</b> <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> guns was maintained at the blockhouse until at least the 1750s, {{but by the end}} of the 18th century the fortification was disused and in ruins.|$|E

5|$|In 1739, the War of Jenkins' Ear {{broke out}} between Britain and Spain, and the {{decision}} was taken to improve the defences at Cromwell Castle. Abraham Tovey, the Master Gunner at the nearby fortification known as the Garrison, constructed a large gun-platform for <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> six guns on the south-west side of the tower, possibly on top of any pre-existing 16th-century platform. A parapet protected the guns, a new entrance was cut into the main tower and other adjustments made.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this moment}} that the timely arrival of the Dutch General Chassé turned the tide in favour of the Anglo-allied army.Chassé's {{relatively}} fresh Dutch division was sent against them, led by <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> Dutch horse-artillery commanded by Captain Krahmer de Bichin. The battery opened a destructive fire into the 1st/3rd Grenadiers' flank. This still did not stop the Guard's advance, so Chassé ordered his first brigade (Colonel Hendrik Detmers) to charge the outnumbered French with the bayonet; the French grenadiers then faltered and broke. The 4th Grenadiers, seeing their comrades retreat and having suffered heavy casualties themselves, now wheeled right about and retired.|$|E
5|$|King Charles's Castle is {{a ruined}} {{artillery}} fort overlooking New Grimsby harbour {{on the island}} of Tresco in the Isles of Scilly. Built between 1548 and 1551 to protect the islands from French attack, it would have held <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> guns and an accompanying garrison, designed to prevent enemy vessels from entering the harbour. The castle is polygonal in design, constructed from granite stone, with the gun battery at the front, and a dining room, kitchen and living accommodation at the rear. An additional defensive earthwork was constructed around it during the 17th century. The design of the castle is unusual for the period, and is only seen elsewhere in blockhouses along the River Thames.|$|E
