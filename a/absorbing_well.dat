40|$|The {{problem of}} the paper is drawing up of the project on {{protection}} {{the territory of the}} Metallurgical terminal of port Ust’-Luga from flooding by the superficial and ground waters. At first, authors gather and analyze materials about topographic, geological and hydrographic situation on above-stated territory and after that made their own territory research. As a result, to protect Metallurgical terminal from flooding by the superficial and ground waters, it was offered three variants of collectors: 1. Open channel 2. Broken stone <b>absorbing</b> <b>well</b> with punched pipe 3. Broken stone <b>absorbing</b> <b>well</b> Authors calculate parameters of collectors and compare them. The most suitable collector for port conditions is broken stone <b>absorbing</b> <b>well</b> with punched pipe because of this reliability and compactness...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a quick and}} cost-effective method for constructing a radiation force balance for measuring ultrasonic output power. It utilises a target manufactured from a high-quality acoustical absorber material. The target geometry {{is in the form}} of a cup or well that is water-filled and placed directly on the pan of a top-loading chemical balance, thus overcoming the need for the traditional gantry arrangement found in the majority of commercially available balances. The face of the transducer is placed directly in the water contained within the well. This simplification reduces time spent in setting up a balance for measurement, and targets can be manufactured to any required geometry and used on any suitable top-loading balance to measure output power. Within this study, the performance of the <b>absorbing</b> <b>well</b> method was evaluated over the frequency range of 1 MHz to 5 MHz, for acoustic power levels up to 1 W. Power measurements on three transducers were compared with measurements made on the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) primary standard radiation force balance and good agreement is demonstrated between the two systems. At a power of 50 mW, using a chemical balance of resolution 0. 1 mg, typical type A (random) uncertainties were ± 2. 0 % when expressed at the 95 % confidence level...|$|E
40|$|Background & Aims of the Study: Leachate {{production}} {{is a major}} problem for solid waste landfills and causes important threat to health public and environment. One of the typical properties of heavy metals is that they cannot easily decompose in the environment. The aim {{of this study was to}} measure of heavy metals concentrations in old-age leachate from Qazvin landfill site, Iran. 			Materials & Methods: Sampling was conducted during summer 2014 from the leachate which was produced in Qazvin landfill site in Lia park. The concentration of heavy metals including Zn, Ni, Hg, Cu, Co, Cd, Cr, Fe, Mn, and Pb along with pH were measured based on the standard method. 			Results: The results of this study indicated the leachate generated from Qazvin landfill site, contains large amounts of different heavy metals. The mean concentration of Zn, Ni, Hg, Cu, Co, Cd, Cr, Fe, Mn, and Pb were 2. 8, 0. 2, 0. 01, 0. 1, 0. 08, 0. 04, 0. 04, 4. 6, 1. 4 and 1. 3 ml/L, respectively. Also pH value was 8. 4. The concentration of Fe, Pb, Zn and Mn in the landfill leachate was higher than the permissible standard value which was suggested by Department of Environmental (DOE). 			 		 	 Conclusion: The results suggest that we can achieve the permissible standards to discharge effluents into the surface water, <b>absorbing</b> <b>well</b> and agricultural irrigation by applying biological and physicochemical methods...|$|E
