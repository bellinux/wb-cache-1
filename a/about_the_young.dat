5|$|Edgardo found {{shelter in}} a convent of the Canons Regular in Austria, {{where he lived}} under an assumed name. In 1872 he moved to a monastery at Poitiers in France, where Pope Pius {{regularly}} corresponded with the bishop <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> man. After a year, Pio Edgardo Mortara was ordained as a priest—with special dispensation as at 21 he was technically too young. He received a personal letter from the Pope to mark the occasion, {{as well as a}} lifetime trust fund of 7,000 lire to support him.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Darwaza {{supported}} the Ottoman Empire {{based on his}} feelings of identification with Islam and {{of belonging to the}} larger Ottoman Muslim ummah ("nation"). In 1906, he served in the local Ottoman administration as a clerk in the Department of Telegraphic and Postal Services (DTPS) in Nablus. His first assignment in that department was for the District of Beisan and northern Palestine (the Galilee and northern Samaria). He was also an Arabist and was enthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Young</b> Turk Revolution in 1908, expecting that the new Ottoman government would institute reforms and grant the Arabs autonomy {{within the framework of the}} empire.|$|E
5|$|Recognising the {{potential}} of the young boy, Maxwell's mother Frances took responsibility for James's early education, which in the Victorian era was largely the job of the woman of the house. At eight he could recite long passages of Milton and the whole of the 119th psalm (176 verses). Indeed, his knowledge of scripture was already very detailed; he could give chapter and verse for almost any quotation from the psalms. His mother was taken ill with abdominal cancer and, after an unsuccessful operation, died in December 1839 when he was eight years old. James's education was then overseen by his father and his father's sister-in-law Jane, both of whom played pivotal roles in his life. His formal schooling began unsuccessfully under the guidance of a sixteen-year-old hired tutor. Little is known <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> man John hired to instruct his son, except that he treated the younger boy harshly, chiding him for being slow and wayward. John dismissed the tutor in November 1841 and, after considerable thought, sent James to the prestigious Edinburgh Academy. He lodged during term times at the house of his aunt Isabella. During this time his passion for drawing was encouraged by his older cousin Jemima.|$|E

25|$|Tutankhamun was the 11th pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of the New Kingdom of Egypt, {{making his}} mummy over 3,300 years old. The {{discovery}} of the tomb {{as a whole was}} one of the most significant and famous archeological discoveries in modern times. There has been great speculation about the alleged Curse of the Pharaohs and also the actual cause of death of King Tutankhamun since very little information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> king is known.|$|E
25|$|Despite this, Bournonville {{decided to}} compose {{his own version}} of the story <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> man who is danced into a spell by a group of elf maidens. In an {{engraving}} from 1856, the painter Edvard Lehmann, who was also a close friend of the Bournonville family, portrayed the spellbound Junker Ove encircled by the hovering, luminous elves. Ove is briefly imprisoned in this state, but fortunately the beautiful Hilda comes to his rescue with water from a healing spring. Even though she has grown up among trolls inside the hill, we know that she is really a changeling, swapped as a baby with the temperamental Birthe, who is the real troll child. The changeling aspect means that the story never becomes as seriously dangerous for Ove as the Sylphide's enchantment is for James in Bournonville's Taglioni-inspired ballet from 1836. But then, again, the Danish Romantics did not cultivate fragmentation {{in the same way as}} the French. The Danes sought for the harmony and the idyll.|$|E
500|$|According to {{at least}} one account, Caion first {{encountered}} Caragiale's irony when he sent him a couple of Symbolist poems. The senior writer picked up on their involuntary humor, and proceeded to ridicule Caion. Literary historian Tudor Vianu believes that Caion was especially infuriated when Caragiale's magazine, Moftul Român, made a public mockery of his Secessionist prose poem. In his gibe, Caragiale feigned enthusiasm <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> writer's debut. Parodying Caion, he suggested that the young poet carry on writing a [...] "lyrical-decadent-symbolist-mystical-capillary-secessionist" [...] novel about a hairdressers' art society, whose members glue strands of hair onto canvasses or carve soap into human figures.|$|E

[...] Pompeo follows a healthy lifestyle, meditates twice a day for 20 minutes each, and does so inside her trailer in between takes as well. Pompeo heavily criticised media reports {{suggesting}} that she suffered from an eating disorder, calling the media irresponsible for promoting such rumours. In a 2007 issue of Los Angeles Confidential Magazine, she said that she was worried <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> girls who look up to her: [...] "I don’t want them to think I starve myself or don’t eat, and that to be like me that’s what they have to do." ...|$|E
500|$|The cover art by Hugh Syme {{features}} {{an elderly woman}} hanging babies by their feet on a seemingly endless clothesline. According to bassist David Ellefson, the artwork concept was directly inspired from a line of the title track, [...] "We've been hung out to dry". He explained that the title track [...] "was probably the strongest representation of how we feel <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> people who listen to our music and what their future holds for them. It's {{like you have a}} choice, you can become proactive or you can choose 'Youthanasia'." [...] The title is a combination [...] of the words [...] "youth" [...] and [...] "euthanasia". Mustaine has stated that the idea for the title stems from hearing about Jack Kevorkian, as well as the declining state of well-being of young people, specifically referring to issues like drugs, crime and violence, and a lack of parenting.|$|E

[...] Gascoyne also asked George and Lucy Squires about their travels early in 1753; George was unable to recall all the places they had visited, and so Gascoyne sent him to Dorset to help him remember. [...] Gascoyne then met with Elizabeth Long (Wells's daughter), who had been prevented by the mob from testifying for her mother, and on 23March three of Canning's former witnesses expressed to Gascoyne their doubts <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> maid's story.

500|$|Lamb {{returned}} to the penitentiary on 18 April 1966 with a report saying that, if released, he would probably relapse into recidivism. Scott grew nervous as Lamb's release date approached: he believed that allowing Lamb to return home could be dangerous for the community, {{but at the same}} time he was not certain <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> man's psychiatric state, describing it as [...] "borderline" [...] or [...] "marginal". Lamb had, Scott noted, shown some minor improvement since his time in the hospital. Even discounting this, the symptoms observed in Lamb were not consistent and the doctor did not think he had evidence conclusive enough to certify Lamb as mentally unsound. He even still considered that the boy could just be playing immature games with the penal system. In this uncertainty, Scott resolved that he could not bar Lamb's release. The 18-year-old boy left Kingston on 8 June 1966, ten months ahead of schedule, and returned home to Windsor. He was taken in by another uncle, Stanley Hesketh, who lived at 1912 Ford Boulevard. Lamb secured a job as a woodworker on his release and after starting work showed no signs of irregular conduct.|$|E
