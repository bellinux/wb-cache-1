5000|$|... 2-3% {{in water}} TEA {{is used as}} an {{corrosion}} inhibitor (<b>anti-rust)</b> <b>agent</b> in immersion ultrasonic testing.|$|E
50|$|It is {{used for}} {{polishing}} alabaster in stonework and lubricating and cleaning pocket knives or food handling tools that use an open bearing, thus needing periodic lubrication. Light mineral oil (paraffinum perliquidum) {{is used as a}} honing oil when sharpening edge tools (such as chisels) on abrasive oil stones. Mineral oil USP or light mineral oil can be used as an <b>anti-rust</b> <b>agent</b> for blades.|$|E
50|$|Partly to {{compensate}} for rust problems on the 1957 models and partly {{to ensure that their}} Unibody cars would remain safe, as rust was a larger problem when body panels were required for strength, Chrysler pioneered the use of electrostatic charges to improve <b>anti-rust</b> <b>agent</b> adhesion in their 1960 models. The company was also the first to use a seven-step rust proofing bath system, though not the first to use rust proofing baths.|$|E
2500|$|The new {{terminal}} was opened on 7 October 2005 by the Prime Minister John Howard and South Australian Premier Mike Rann. However, Adelaide Airport Limited announced soon afterward that only international flights {{would use the}} new facility immediately due to problems with the fuel pumps and underground pipes. These problems related initially to the <b>anti-rusting</b> <b>agent</b> applied to the insides of the fuel pumps, then to construction debris in the pipes. Although international and regional (from December 2005) aircraft were refuelled via tankers, a lack of space and safety concerns prevented this action for domestic jet aircraft, which instead continued operations at the old terminal. The re-fueling system was cleared of all debris and the {{new terminal}} was used for all flights from 17 February 2006. The new airport terminal is approximately [...] end to end and is capable of handling 27 aircraft, including an Airbus A380, simultaneously and processing 3,000 passengers per hour. It includes high-amenity public and airline lounges, 14 glass-sided aerobridges, 42 common user check-in desks and 34 shop fronts. Free wireless Internet is also provided throughout the terminal by Internode Systems, a first for an Australian airport.|$|R
50|$|Elf, a me-too drain cleanser, {{consisted}} of lye crystals. This was a less effective agent than crystal Drano, which added aluminum shards to generate heat {{and provide a}} sharp edge to cut through hair, but it was equally good as any of Drano's other me-too competitors. Delete rust and stain remover {{consisted of}} oxalic acid (an <b>anti-rust</b> <b>agent),</b> citric acid (a chelating agent) and microcrystalline cellulose, a very soft abrasive. It was a good product, but not an inspired one, and it addressed a very small niche in the marketplace.|$|E
