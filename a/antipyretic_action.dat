40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} whether the antipyretic effect of dexa 2 methasone (DEX) delivered by intravenous injection (iv) on intracerebroventricularly (icv) administered egtazic acid 2 induced febrile response is relevant to the changes in cytosolic free calcium concentration of the hypothalamus. The colon temperatures were measured by a thermistor and the cytosolic free calcium concen 2 tration ([Ca 2 +]i) in dissociated brain cells was measured by Fura 22 AM. The results demonstrated that the pyretic action of egtazic acid (016 μmol, icv) was markedly inhibited by DEX (5 mg / kg,iv), but DEX (60 ～ 120 μmol / L) did′t affect [Ca 2 +]i in dissociated hypothalamus cells. Actinomycin D, which interferes with gene transcription (3 nmol, icv), completely abolished the <b>antipyretic</b> <b>action</b> of DEX on egtazic acid 2 induced fever. These findings suggest that the <b>antipyretic</b> <b>action</b> of DEX on egtazic acid 2 induced fever is related to the activation of certain gene expression in the brain,but not to the changes of transmembrane calcium ion current in hypothalamus neurons.

It has a prompt <b>antipyretic</b> <b>action</b> in man but this is too sudden and not prolonged enough for successful thera-peutic use. Its formation from acetanilide as indicated in the previous paper and as Heubner (2) showed from acetphenetidin suggests that the <b>antipyretic</b> <b>action</b> of these substances {{may be due to}} the slow formation of p-aminophenol.

50|$|A {{number of}} {{arguments}} counted against the COX-3 hypothesis: COX-2-selective inhibitors react weakly with the COX-3 enzymatic site, because {{the site is}} identical to that in COX-1, but they are as good at reducing fever as older NSAIDs. The fever response has also been clearly associated with a rapid induction of COX-2 expression and an associated increase in prostaglandin E2 production, with no role for COX-1 or a COX-1 gene product (e.g., COX-3). Finally, the sites of COX-3 expression {{do not appear to}} fit in well with those sites associated with fever, and the protein should be present within the hypothalamus rather than the cerebral cortex. All these considerations appeared to argue against COX-3 being the site of the <b>antipyretic</b> <b>actions</b> of NSAIDs and COX-2-selective agents.

40|$|INTRODUCTION. It {{is known}} that fever is a {{necessary}} defense response that activates the immune system, enhances phagocytosis, stimulates the formation of Interferon, antibody production, which leads to inhibition of reproduction of many viruses and bacteria. However, the raising of the temperature above 39 ° C is dangerous for adults and children of all ages. Despite the high efficacy of analgesics, antipyretics, their use is not always safe. Therefore, the search for new highly efficient drug with <b>antipyretic</b> <b>action</b> is an urgent problem nowadays. RESEARCH GOAL - was pharmacological antipyretics screening among first synthesized derivatives of 1, 2, 4 -triazoles. MATERIALS AND METHODS of research. The experimental fever reproduced on white nonlinear rats by administering 2, 4 -dinitrophenol (2, 4 -DNP) (disconnector of the oxidative phosphorylation) at a dose of 20 mg / kg. Investigated substances were injected through 0. 5 hours (T 0, 5) after administration of 2, 4 -DNP, rectal body temperature for 1 hour (T 1) was fixed. Initial rectal temperature (T 0) recorded to intra-abdominal injection 2. 4 -DNF. Acetylsalicylic acid {{was used as a}} comparison reference drug at a dose of 100 mg / kg. The results were processed with modern statistical methods of analysis on a personal computer using standard software package Microsoft Office 2010 (Microsoft Excel) and «STATISTICA ® for Windows 6. 0 ». We used 3 levels of statistical significance of differences in outcomes research - p < 0. 05, p < 0. 01, and P < 0. 001. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. A new antipyretics were identified with activity not less than in the standard for comparison - acetylsalicylic acid. Intraabdominal injection of 2, 4 -DNF in 0. 5 hour caused a fever in rat in average from 37. 480 to 38. 580 Co (Δ 1, 10 C). Most significantly retarded the body temperature in animals compound number 76 (ΔT 1, 230 C, p < 0. 01), 86 (ΔT 1, 140 C, p < 0. 001), 85 (ΔT 1, 330 C, p < 0. 01), 87 (ΔT 1, 010 S, p < 0. 01), it’s action were somewhat higher than <b>antipyretic</b> <b>action</b> of acetylsalicylic acid (ΔT 0, 980 C, p < 0. 05).

HCT- 2037 was two-fold more potent (ID 50 of 0. 75 ± 0. 1 μmol kg− 1) in responses to mechanical stimuli and very effective in reducing wind-up (63 ± 17 % of control; P< 0. 01; MED: 0. 4 μmol kg− 1), indicating a greater activity than the parent compound. In awake animals with inflammation, HCT- 2037 p. o. fully inhibited mechanical allodynia, 91 ± 12 % reduction, and hyperalgesia, 94 ± 8 % reduction. Equivalent doses of S-ketoprofen only partially reduced either allodynia (50 ± 11 %) or hyperalgesia (40 ± 4 %). The effect on responses to noxious thermal stimulation was similar for the two compounds. We conclude that the molecular changes made {{in the structure of}} S-ketoprofen including an NO moiety in its structure, improve the antinociceptive profile of the compound opening new perspectives in a safer use of NSAIDs as analgesic drugs...|$|R
30|$|NSAIDs are {{effective}} and {{widely available in}} over-the-counter formulations without considering the relative contraindications, because they have analgesic, <b>antipyretic,</b> and anti-inflammatory <b>actions</b> (Am, 2009; El-Maddawy & El-Ashmawy, 2013; Elazem & Abo-Kora, 2015). Further, paracetamol is scrutinized as a derivative of para-aminophenol class of NSAIDs and broadly used in analgo-antipyretic purposes without medical prescription especially in childhood (Aghababian, 2010; Hamza & Al-Harbi, 2015; Matić et al., 2016). The major goal of the current work was to explore the immunological and biochemical changes in mice after administration with repeated doses of Diclo, Ibu, and Para for 1  month.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION. The {{main action}} of {{paracetamol}} (acetaminophen) {{is presumed to}} be in the central nervous system. The central nervous system penetration of paracetamol has been described in children with intracranial pathologies but not in children with an intact blood-brain barrier. OBJECTIVE. We investigated the cerebrospinal fluid penetration of paracetamol in 32 healthy children, aged 3 months to 12 years, who were undergoing surgery in the lower body using spinal anesthesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. In this open-label prospective study, children were given a single intravenous injection of paracetamol (15 mg/kg). Cerebrospinal fluid and venous blood samples were obtained between 5 minutes and 5 hours after injection. Paracetamol concentrations were determined from the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma by using a fluorescence polarization immunoassay. RESULTS. Paracetamol was detected in cerebrospinal fluid from the earliest sample at 5 minutes, although in this sample paracetamol concentration was below the limit of quantification of 1. 0 mg/L. Subsequent paracetamol concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid ranged between 1. 3 and 18 mg/L (median: 7. 2 mg/L), plasma concentrations ranged between 2. 4 and 33 mg/L, and cerebrospinal fluid/plasma ratios ranged between 0. 06 and 2. 0. The highest CSF paracetamol concentration was detected at 57 minutes. CONCLUSIONS. Paracetamol permeates readily into the cerebrospinal fluid of children. This fast and extensive transfer enables the rapid central analgesic and <b>antipyretic</b> <b>action</b> of intravenous paracetamol...|$|E
40|$|Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is a {{commonly}} used over-the-counter analgesic and antipyretic and {{has previously been}} shown to improve exercise performance through a reduction in perceived pain. This study sought to establish whether its <b>antipyretic</b> <b>action</b> may also improve exercise capacity in the heat by moderating the increase in core temperature. On separate days, 11 recreationally active participants completed a graded exercise test, a familiarisation time to exhaustion and two experimental time to exhaustion trials on a cycle ergometer in hot conditions (30 °C, 50 % rh) after ingesting a placebo control or an oral dose of acetaminophen in a randomised, double-blind design. Following acetaminophen ingestion, participants cycled for a significantly {{longer period of time}} (acetaminophen = 23 ± 15 min vs. placebo = 19 ± 13 min, p = 0. 005) (95 % CI = 90 - 379 s), and this was accompanied by significantly lower core (- 0. 15 °C), skin (- 0. 47 °C) and body temperatures (0. 19 °C) (p 0. 05). This is the first study to demonstrate that an acute dose of acetaminophen can improve cycling capacity in hot conditions, and that {{this may be due to}} the observed reduction in core, skin and body temperature, and the subjective perception of thermal comfort. These findings suggest that ACT may reduce the thermoregulatory strain elicited from exercise, thus improving time to exhaustion...|$|E
40|$|Context: Euphorbia pulcherrima (EP) {{belongs to}} the family: Euphorbiaceae and Genus: Euphorbia. Many species of Euphorbia have been {{reported}} as having beneficial properties like anticonvulsive effect, central analgesic properties, <b>antipyretic</b> <b>action,</b> central depressant action and strong sedative effect. However, little study has been done and published on EP. Aims: To observe and evaluate various neuropharmacological effects like antinociceptive effect, anticonvulsant effect, motor in-coordination, pentobarbital induced sleeping time and behavioral responses of EP in mice and rats. Setting and Design: Quantitative experimental study in mice and rats by various experimental models. Materials and Methods: Different experimental models {{were used to assess}} the antinociceptive effect (hotplate, tail flick and acetic acid induced writhing test), anticonvulsant effect (Maximal Electroshock Seizure test [MES] and Pentylenetetrazole induced seizures [PTZ]), motor in-coordination effect (Rota rod test), pentobarbital induced sleeping time and behavioral responses of EP in mice and rats after oral administration of EP crude dried extracts in three different doses (250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg). Statistical Analysis Used: The significance of difference with respect to control was evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test. A probability (P-value) level less than 0. 05 was considered as significant. Results: In MES test model, duration of tonic hind limb extension in mice treated with EP was significantly less as compared to vehicle treated group. EP was most effective in a dose of 1000 mg/kg. There was also significant increase in the latency and decrease in the incidence of convulsions with the use of EP in three different doses in PTZ induced seizure model. Conclusions: This study showed EP (crude dried) extracts to possess anticonvulsant properties but no effect on motor co-ordination and anxiety...|$|E
500|$|Interest in {{metformin}} resumed {{at the end}} of the 1940s. In 1950, metformin, {{unlike some}} other similar compounds, was found not to decrease blood pressure and heart rate in animals. That year, Filipino physician Eusebio Y. Garcia used metformin (he named it Fluamine) to treat influenza; he noted the drug [...] "lowered the blood sugar to minimum physiological limit" [...] and was not toxic. Garcia believed metformin to have bacteriostatic, antiviral, antimalarial, <b>antipyretic</b> and analgesic <b>actions.</b> In a series of articles in 1954, Polish pharmacologist Janusz Supniewski was unable to confirm most of these effects, including lowered blood sugar. Instead he observed antiviral effects in humans.|$|R
40|$|Acetaminophen, {{also known}} as paracetamol, is a nonsteroidal anti-in¯ammatory drug with potent <b>antipyretic</b> and {{analgesic}} <b>actions</b> but with very weak anti-in¯ammatory activity. When administered to humans, it reduces levels of prostaglandin metabolites in urine but does not reduce synthesis of prostaglandins by blood platelets or by the stomach mucosa. Because acetaminophen is a weak inhibitor in vitro of both cyclooxygenase (COX) ± 1 and COX- 2, the possibility exists that it inhibits a so far unidenti®ed form of COX, perhaps COX- 3. In animal studies, COX enzymes in homogenates of different tissues vary in sensitivity to the inhibitory action of acetaminophen. This may be evidence that there are 12 isoforms of the enzyme. Recently, a variant of COX- 2 induced with high concentrations of nonsteroidal anti-in¯am-matory drugs was shown to be highly sensitive to inhibition by acetaminophen. Therefore COX- 3 may be {{a product of the}} same gene that encodes COX- 2, but have different molecular characteristics. Acetaminophen, known as paracetamol in the United King-dom, was introduced to medicine in 1893 [1]. It had only limited use, however, until 1949, when it was identi®ed as the activ...|$|R
40|$|Curcuma aeruginosa (C. aeruginosa) Roxb. (Zingiberaceae) {{is known}} in Thai as Waan-Ma-Haa-Mek. The {{rhizomes}} of this plant {{have been used as}} a component of Thai herbal medicinal recipes used for decreasing dysmenorrhea. In the present study, the analgesic, <b>antipyretic</b> and anti-inflammatory <b>actions</b> of this plant were investigated in experimental animals. The rhizomes of C. aeruginosa were extracted with chloroform, methanol and water to give chloroform, methanol and aqueous extracts, respectively. The effects of the three extracts on nociceptive response using writhing, hot plate and formalin tests in mice were performed. The antipyretic activity in yeast-induced fever and the anti-inflammatory activity in carrageenin-induced edema in rats, were examined. The LD 50 value of orally administered the chloroform extract and methanol extract in mice was 3. 03 g/kg. No dead mice were observed after oral administration of aqueous extract at the dose of 10 g/kg. Oral administration of the chloroform extract and the methanol extract of C. aeruginosa rhizomes (100 - 400 mg/kg) significantly decreased the number of writhings and stretchings induced by acetic acid. Only the chloroform extract suppressed the licking activity of the late phase in the formalin test in mice. All extracts of C. aeruginosa rhizomes had no effects on heat-induced pain in mice, yeast-induced fever and carrageenin-induced edema in rats. These results suggest that the chloroform extract of C. aeruginosa rhizome possesses analgesic effect via a different mechanism from that of the aspirin...|$|R
