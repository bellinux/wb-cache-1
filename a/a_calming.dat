5|$|Benzodiazepines work by {{increasing}} the efficiency of a natural brain chemical, GABA, to decrease the excitability of neurons. This reduces the communication between neurons and, therefore, has <b>a</b> <b>calming</b> effect {{on many of the}} functions of the brain.|$|E

After the conversation, Dr. Heller reviews a taped therapy session in which Dave threatens to get revenge on the man who destroyed his life.|$|E
5|$|The two clubs {{were due}} to meet a month earlier, but the stadium {{disaster}} at Hillsborough, which killed 96 of Liverpool's supporters, meant the fixture was postponed out of respect. It was moved to late May, days after the FA Cup Final which Liverpool won. Arsenal manager George Graham prepared for the match by giving his squad a minibreak and created <b>a</b> <b>calming</b> atmosphere in their training sessions. He adjusted his usual formation to a defensive one to stop Liverpool's attacking threat; David O'Leary was employed as a sweeper in a back five.|$|E

5|$|Though the Earl {{had come}} out as homosexual, on 14 September 1984 he married Francesca Fisher, then 20, the day before his 30th birthday. In sharp {{contrast}} to the Earl, Fisher was a teetotaler and a vegetarian, and he hoped she would be <b>a</b> <b>calming</b> influence on his life. He also wanted to give up drug use and homosexuality and produce an heir. His father refused to attend the wedding, going as far as to place an advertisement in The Times that he had a prior engagement. The marriage lasted for three years, but quickly fell apart after he started freebasing cocaine and using rent boys. During the marriage, the Earl accidentally drove a car half way over a cliff while Francesca was a passenger. They had no children. He later formed a close friendship with James Whitby, who became a companion for most of the remainder of his life.|$|E

25|$|Reserpine-mediated {{depletion}} of monoamine neurotransmitters in the synapses {{is often cited}} as evidence to the theory that {{depletion of}} the monoamine neurotransmitters causes subsequent depression in humans (c.f. monoamine hypothesis). However, this claim is not without controversy. The reserpine-induced depression is considered by some researchers to be a myth, while others claim that teas made out of the plant roots containing reserpine have <b>a</b> <b>calming,</b> sedative action that can actually be considered antidepressant. Notably, reserpine was the first compound shown {{to be an effective}} antidepressant in a randomized placebo-controlled trial.|$|E
25|$|Diazepam, first {{marketed as}} Valium, is a {{medication}} of the benzodiazepine family that typically produces <b>a</b> <b>calming</b> effect. It {{is commonly used}} to treat a range of conditions including anxiety, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, muscle spasms, seizures, trouble sleeping, and restless legs syndrome. It may {{also be used to}} cause memory loss during certain medical procedures. It can be taken by mouth, inserted into the rectum, injected into muscle, or injected into a vein. When given into a vein, effects begin in one to five minutes and last up to an hour. By mouth, effects may take 40 minutes to begin.|$|E

25|$|This {{style was}} admired by Mackintosh because of: its {{restraint}} and economy of means rather than ostentatious accumulation; its simple forms and natural materials rather than elaboration and artifice; {{the use of}} texture and light and shadow rather than pattern and ornament. In the old western style, furniture was seen as ornament that displayed the wealth of its owner {{and the value of}} the piece was established according to the length of time spent creating it. In the Japanese arts furniture and design focused {{on the quality of the}} space, which was meant to evoke <b>a</b> <b>calming</b> and organic feeling to the interior.|$|E
25|$|Support for {{the social}} and genetic {{function}} of aggregations, especially those formed by fish, {{can be seen in}} several aspects of their behaviour. For instance, experiments have shown that individual fish removed from a school will have a higher respiratory rate than those found in the school. This effect has been attributed to stress, and the effect of being with conspecifics therefore appears to be <b>a</b> <b>calming</b> one and a powerful social motivation for remaining in an aggregation. Herring, for instance, will become very agitated if they are isolated from conspecifics. Because of their adaptation to schooling behaviour they are rarely displayed in aquaria. Even with the best facilities aquaria can offer they become fragile and sluggish compared to their quivering energy in wild schools.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people with}} anxiety {{disorders}} benefit from joining a self-help or support group (telephone conference-call support groups or online support groups being of particular help for completely housebound individuals). Sharing problems and achievements with others, {{as well as}} sharing various self-help tools, are common activities in these groups. In particular, stress management techniques and various kinds of meditation practices and visualization techniques can help people with anxiety disorders calm themselves and may enhance the effects of therapy, as can service to others, which can distract from the self-absorption that tends to go with anxiety problems. Also, preliminary evidence suggests aerobic exercise may have <b>a</b> <b>calming</b> effect. Since caffeine, certain illicit drugs, and even some over-the-counter cold medications can aggravate the symptoms of anxiety disorders, they should be avoided.|$|E

25|$|Israel is {{emerging}} as a popular destination for medical tourists. In 2006, 15,000 foreigners travelled to the country for medical procedures, bringing in $40 million of revenue. The advantages of Israel for health tourism include good natural resources; stable, comfortable climate all year round; a progressive medical systems, and scenic locations which have <b>a</b> <b>calming</b> effect on patients. Medical tourists choose Israel for several reasons. Some come from European nations such as Romania where certain procedures are not available. Others come to Israel, most commonly from the United States, because they can receive quality health care {{at a fraction of}} the cost it would be at home, for both surgeries and in-vitro fertilization treatments. Other medical tourists come to Israel to visit the Dead Sea, a world-famous therapeutic resort. The Israel Ministry of Tourism and several professional medical services providers have set out to generate awareness of Israel's medical capabilities.|$|E
25|$|Thomas bowled over 63,000 balls for Northamptonshire, and {{opposing}} batsmen scored {{off of the}} Welsh medium-pacer at {{an average}} of just under two runs an over. It was his control that was a significant feature of the clubs bowling attack following the First World War. Furthermore, his approach to life mirrored his approach to cricket; sound, level-headed and <b>a</b> <b>calming</b> influence on some of his more temperamental colleagues. Billeted in Northampton during the war years, Thomas had attracted the attention of groundsman Alf Stockwin when he came to bowl in the nets at Wantage Road. His debut, against the Australian Imperial Forces side in 1919, was not a great success, but Northampton Grammar School took him on as groundsman and coach, giving Northamptonshire the opportunity to keep tabs on him. They decided to take another look and he justified their interest with 9-30 against Yorkshire at Bradford in 1920 with the last seven wickets only costing him six runs, and one lifting ball hit wicketkeeper Walter Buswell in the eye and put him out of the match. Only 'Bumper' Wells' dismissal of Roy Kilner prevented the county's first 'all-ten'.|$|E
