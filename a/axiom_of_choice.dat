5|$|Every {{vector space}} has a basis. This follows from Zorn's lemma, an {{equivalent}} {{formulation of the}} <b>Axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Choice.</b> Given the other axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the existence of bases {{is equivalent to the}} <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice.</b> The ultrafilter lemma, which is weaker than the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice,</b> implies that all bases of a given vector space have the same number of elements, or cardinality (cf. Dimension theorem for vector spaces). It is called the dimension of the vector space, denoted by dim V. If the space is spanned by finitely many vectors, the above statements can be proven without such fundamental input from set theory.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Zermelo {{published}} his axiom system for set theory. He had two motivations {{for developing the}} axiom system: eliminating the paradoxes and securing his proof of the well-ordering theorem. Zermelo had proved this theorem in 1904 using the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice,</b> but his proof was criticized {{for a variety of}} reasons. His response to the criticism included his axiom system and a new proof of the well-ordering theorem. His axioms support this new proof, and they eliminate the paradoxes by restricting the formation of sets.|$|E
25|$|Although {{originally}} controversial, the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> is {{now used}} without reservation by most mathematicians, {{and it is}} included in the standard form of axiomatic set theory, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> (ZFC). One motivation for this use is that a number of generally accepted mathematical results, such as Tychonoff's theorem, require the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> for their proofs. Contemporary set theorists also study axioms that are not compatible with the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice,</b> such as the axiom of determinacy. The <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> is avoided in some varieties of constructive mathematics, although there are varieties of constructive mathematics in which the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> is embraced.|$|E

25|$|Some {{results in}} {{constructive}} set theory use the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> countable <b>choice</b> or the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> dependent <b>choice,</b> {{which do not}} imply {{the law of the}} excluded middle in constructive set theory. Although the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> countable <b>choice</b> in particular is commonly used in constructive mathematics, its use has also been questioned.|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of optimal strategic asset allocation for investors with behavioural utilities saving for retirement is addressed. To date this {{problem has been}} studied assuming that an investor is rational in the sense when making investment decisions the preference relation of the investor satisfies all the <b>axioms</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice.</b> Research in behavioural science indicates that investment related decisions of many people do not satisfy the <b>axioms</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice.</b> Our interest is in developing a platform that allows {{the use of a}} broader class of utilities {{that may or may not}} satisfy the <b>axioms</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice.</b> Such utilities may not be convex. Our interest is in developing a framework algorithm that enables a user considerable flexibility in how their needs may be specified. For illustrative purposes a binomial tree is used to model asset returns, although the method developed can be used with more elaborate models...|$|R
25|$|In {{constructive}} set theory, however, Diaconescu's theorem {{shows that}} the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> implies the law of excluded middle (unlike in Martin-Löf type theory, where it does not). Thus the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> is not generally available in constructive set theory. A cause for this {{difference is that the}} <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> in type theory does not have the extensionality properties that the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> in constructive set theory does.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} inner models {{is common in}} the study of determinacy and large cardinals, {{especially}} when considering axioms such as the axiom of determinacy that contradict the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice.</b> Even if a fixed model of set theory satisfies the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice,</b> it is possible for an inner model to fail to satisfy the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice.</b> For example, the existence of sufficiently large cardinals implies that there is an inner model satisfying the axiom of determinacy (and thus not satisfying the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice).</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite these {{seemingly}} paradoxical facts, most mathematicians accept the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> as a valid principle for proving new results in mathematics. The debate is interesting enough, however, {{that it is}} considered of note when a theorem in ZFC (ZF plus AC) is logically equivalent (with just the ZF axioms) to the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice,</b> and mathematicians look for results that require the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> to be false, though this type of deduction is less common than the type which requires the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> to be true.|$|E

25|$|A proof {{requiring}} the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> may establish {{the existence of}} an object without explicitly defining the object in the language of set theory. For example, while the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> implies that there is a well-ordering of the real numbers, there are models of set theory with the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> in which no well-ordering of the reals is definable. Similarly, although a subset of the real numbers that is not Lebesgue measurable can be proved to exist using the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice,</b> it is consistent that no such set is definable.|$|E
25|$|The {{statement}} of the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> does not specify whether the collection of nonempty sets is finite or infinite, and thus implies that every finite collection of nonempty sets has a choice function. However, that particular case is a theorem of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> (ZF); it is easily proved by mathematical induction. In the even simpler case {{of a collection of}} one set, a choice function just corresponds to an element, so this instance of the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> says that every nonempty set has an element; this holds trivially. The <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> can be seen as asserting the generalization of this property, already evident for finite collections, to arbitrary collections.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} other {{equivalent}} statements of the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice.</b> These are equivalent in the sense that, {{in the presence of}} other basic axioms of set theory, they imply the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> and are implied by it.|$|E

The cofinality of a partially ordered set A can alternatively be defined as the least ordinal x such that there is a function from x to A with cofinal image. This second definition makes sense without the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice.</b> If the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> is assumed, as will be the case in the rest of this article, then the two definitions are equivalent.|$|E

25|$|Assuming ZF is consistent, Kurt Gödel {{showed that}} the {{negation}} of the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> is not a theorem of ZF by constructing an inner model (the constructible universe) which satisfies ZFC and thus showing that ZFC is consistent. Assuming ZF is consistent, Paul Cohen employed the technique of forcing, developed for this purpose, {{to show that the}} <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> itself is not a theorem of ZF by constructing a much more complex model which satisfies ZF¬C (ZF with the negation of AC added as axiom) and thus showing that ZF¬C is consistent. Together these results establish that the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> is logically independent of ZF. The assumption that ZF is consistent is harmless because adding another axiom to an already inconsistent system cannot make the situation worse. Because of independence, the decision whether to use the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> (or its negation) in a proof cannot be made by appeal to other axioms of set theory. The decision must be made on other grounds.|$|E
