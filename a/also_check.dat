Construction started in mid-1993 and was designed by the Majorcan architect Pere Nicolau Bover. During the construction in 1995, passenger numbers exceeded 15 million. The new terminal finally opened in 1997.|$|E
25|$|During a {{physical}} exam a doctor can {{determine whether the}} tremor occurs primarily during action or at rest. The doctor will <b>also</b> <b>check</b> for tremor symmetry, any sensory loss, weakness or muscle atrophy, or decreased reflexes. A detailed family history may indicate if the tremor is inherited. Blood or urine tests can detect thyroid malfunction, other metabolic causes, and abnormal levels of certain chemicals that can cause tremor. These tests may also help to identify contributing causes, such as drug interaction, chronic alcoholism, or another condition or disease. Diagnostic imaging using CT or MRI imaging may help determine if the tremor {{is the result of}} a structural defect or degeneration of the brain.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} and often difficult jobs of a mashgiach, however, is the checking in and verification of shipments. The mashgiach must ensure that every food product that arrives at the facility has a reliable hekhsher before it is used. Suppliers often substitute products {{that are out of}} stock with non-kosher products. Non-kosher establishments would generally not mind these substitutions. For a kosher establishment, however, these substitutions can cause major problems. If a product arrives without a hekhsher, the mashgiach must make sure the product is clearly marked as non-kosher and is not used, but returned to the supplier. Sometimes a product arrives that is purportedly kosher, but no hekhsher can be found. In this case, the mashgiach obtains a valid letter of certification from the certifying rabbi or kashrut agency, usually by contacting the manufacturer. In addition to checking hekhsherim, the mashgiach must <b>also</b> <b>check</b> that all meat products that arrive are double sealed, usually by inner and outer plastic bags or an inner plastic bag and a sealed box, and that all wine is kosher wine.|$|E

500|$|Given {{the high}} levels of drug-related {{activities}} in northern Mexico and in Tamaulipas, many Facebook users <b>also</b> <b>check</b> Valor por Tamaulipas to verify if there is a shootout in their area, to know in what part of a highway a carjacking took place, or to see if someone is reported missing. The information found at Valor por Tamaulipas is shared by Internet users themselves; the administrator, on the other hand, was active almost all hours during the day and throughout the whole week. Most of the Mexican mainstream media outlets play down the violence because they fear reprisals from the country's criminal organizations. Given the censorship, Valor por Tamaulipas was a popular outlet for crime watchdogs concerned with the violence in Tamaulipas. According to crime journalist James Barger from InSight Crime, the information in Valor por Tamaulipas is [...] "spotty, sometimes unreliable, but often the only source of what [...] happening". Several Internet users in Mexico, the United States, and in other countries around the world have shown their support for Valor por Tamaulipas' work and have followed their reports on Facebook and/or Twitter.|$|E
500|$|After riders {{board the}} sim-cars and the seat belts are fastened, {{the car that}} they {{designed}} will undergo four different tests: capability, efficiency, responsiveness, and power. In the capability test the car first connects to OnStar, then accelerates past a rain projection and skids out of control. Next, the continuing path disappears and the sim-car turns around to speed up again. A short time later, the sim-car makes a sharp left turn as a lighting bolt strikes. The car then passes by a futuristic city. Following the capability test, the results of which car designs scored {{the best in the}} test are displayed. The sim-car then begins the efficiency test. In the first part, the sim-cars are scanned for [...] "optimum eco-efficiency". The second test performs an aero-dynamic test on the vehicle. Finally, a [...] "hyper-spectrum imaging" [...] takes place. Again, after the test is complete, the best scores are displayed. The third test, responsiveness, is next. The sim-car accelerates around hairpin turns with laser-projected trees. It then enters a tunnel to encounter the 18-wheeler from the original version though it is now shown with lasers. When the vehicle exits the tunnel, the results for the responsiveness test are displayed and all of the test icons are displayed. The final test is power where the sim-car stops for a moment then accelerates through flashing purple arches to a wall with the ride's logo on it leading to the outside portion of the ride. Just after the ride exits the building, a picture of the guests is taken. As the sim-car's speed is increased, it makes a right turn, followed by a wide left, a straight section, and one final long left turn. When the test is complete, the vehicle returns to the loading station where the next riders board. Then, guests use their MagicBand, ticket, or design key that has their Chevrolet Custom Concept Vehicle that they made in the Design Studio to play games and make an ad in the [...] "Chevrolet Showroom." [...] In the showroom, you can <b>also</b> <b>check</b> out some of the newest vehicles Chevrolet has created in their lineup. There is also a gift shop located at the exit like the original version of the ride.|$|E

2500|$|A {{thriving}} underground {{scene was}} marked {{by the start of}} Tilos Rádió in 1991, the first free independent community station, starting out as a pirate radio. The station soon developed strong ties with the first alternative electronic formations, and inspired to start many others. Bands like Korai Öröm and Másfél (<b>also</b> <b>check</b> Myster Mobius) started, playing ambient, psychedelic music. Anima Sound System, {{one of the most influential}} bands on the scene, was created in 1993 playing dub and trip-hop influenced by acid jazz and ethnic music. [...] Several other bands and formations followed, like Colorstar and Neo. Neo has won a worldwide reputation for their unique electro-pop style and the [...] "Mozart of pop music" [...] award (Cannes, 2004) they received for their soundtrack album called [...] "Control". Apart from Anima, ethnic and folk influenced the scene in many ways, exemplified by formations like Balkan Fanatik, or Mitsoura. One of the most successful Hungarian electronic musician is Yonderboi, who recently co-created Žagar, gaining wide reputation in the country. In the past few years, dubstep has gained popular attention as well, nationwide.|$|E
60|$|Not {{perhaps to}} the lowest. There can be no disputing that our present civilization does {{discourage}} much of the innate bestiality of man; that it helps people to a measure of continence, cleanliness and mutual toleration; that it does much to suppress brute violence, the spirit of lawlessness, cruelty and wanton destruction. But {{on the other hand}} it does <b>also</b> <b>check</b> and cripple generosity and frank truthfulness, any disinterested creative passion, the love of beauty, the passion for truth and research, and it stimulates avarice, parsimony, overreaching, usury, falsehood and secrecy, by making money-getting its criterion of intercourse.|$|E
60|$|There was an anodyne {{mixture on}} the rude shelf, which {{the doctor had}} left on his morning visit.

As he lay more quiet, muttering still, but now unintelligibly, Daddy, waiting for a more complete unconsciousness {{and the opportunity to}} slip away to Falloner's, cast his eyes around the cabin. He noticed {{now for the first time}} since his entrance that a crumpled envelope bearing a Western post-mark was lying at the foot of the bed. Daddy knew that the tri-weekly post had arrived an hour before he came, and that Lasham had evidently received a letter. Sure enough the letter itself was lying against the wall beside him. It was open. Daddy felt justified in reading it.|$|E

60|$|As worms line their burrows {{with their}} castings, {{and as the}} burrows {{penetrate}} {{to a depth of}} 5 or 6, or even more feet, some small amount of the humus-acids will be carried far down, and will there act on the underlying rocks and fragments of rock. Thus the thickness of the soil, if none be removed from the surface, will steadily though slowly tend to increase; but the accumulation will after a time delay the disintegration of the underlying rocks and of the more deeply seated particles. For the humus-acids which are generated chiefly in the upper layer of vegetable mould, are extremely unstable compounds, and are liable to decomposition before they reach any considerable depth. {66} A thick bed of overlying soil will <b>also</b> <b>check</b> the downward extension of great fluctuations of temperature, and in cold countries will check the powerful action of frost. The free access of air will likewise be excluded. From these several causes disintegration would be almost arrested, if the overlying mould were to increase much in thickness, owing to none or little being removed from the surface. {67} In my own immediate neighbourhood we have a curious proof how effectually a few feet of clay checks some change which goes on in flints, lying freely exposed; for the large ones which have lain for some time on the surface of ploughed fields cannot be used for building; they will not cleave properly, and are said by the workmen to be rotten. {68} It is therefore necessary to obtain flints for building purposes from the bed of red clay overlying the chalk (the residue of its dissolution by rain-water) or from the chalk itself.|$|E
