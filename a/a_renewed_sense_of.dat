Though all three were initially suspicious of him (especially Vaan, who blamed him for Reks's death), Basch protested his innocence and told them about his twin. The party decided his story was plausible and released him. After being freed, he made it his mission to protect Ashe and support the resistance.

During the past seven years, many people have gained greater appreciation of the discovered and yetto‐ be discovered treasures held within the Southern Nevada public lands. People {{have had the opportunity}} to learn about and make a first‐time connection with nature and the community within which they live. Some participants realized dynamic and everlasting changes in their lives as a result of their new experiences and insights. Education in the Environment was a four‐year collaborative effort of the Southern Nevada Agency Partnership and the UNLV’s Public Lands Institute. The effort was funded by a Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act (SNPLMA) Conservation Initiative through the Great Basin Cooperative Ecosystem Study Unit (CESU). The Conservation Education and Interpretation portion of the initiative encompassed a variety of activities organized into 10 Tasks, which this Project Compendium describes. The success of this effort would not have been possible without the commitment and participation of many people within the four federal land management agencies, the CESU program, and UNLV. More importantly, it would not have been successful without the outstanding participation of people of all ages in Southern Nevada, across the State, and within the nation who believed in its importance.

They cover a wide range of literary responses and genres: eighteenth century drama, the Gothic novel, verse, autobiography, history, religious writing, journalism, women’s memoirs, travel writing, popular fiction, and the modernist novel. Brought together in one volume, these essays offer a small, but representative sample of the multifaceted literary and cultural traffic between Britain and India in the colonial period.

40|$|In-betweenness {{is related}} to liminality, is intermediary, interstitial, {{transitional}} and hybrid and has been theorised in anthropology as a culturally recognised liminal state that occurs during rites of passage or transition. In this paper, the focus on liminal states facilitates an understanding of transversal movements between being mothers, academics and artists and recognizes the in-betweenness of family and professional life and their influences upon one another. Whilst privileging the in-between makes for a rich and creative life for women, this life comes at a cost within the hierarchical structures of our public and educational institutions. This paper explores ways to develop collegial and personal connections that are particularly empowering for female academics.

40|$|In {{response}} to the social fragmentation wrought {{in the wake of}} WWI, many French avant-garde writers integrated the findings of sociological studies of religion into their art. The authors considered here, including Georges Bataille, Michel Leiris, and Collette Peignot, believed that literature could effect <b>a</b> <b>renewed</b> religious <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> human communion able to redress the social and political fragmentation of interwar France. Integral to this endeavor was their conception of self-sacrifice, which they sought both to represent and practice in literary form. As I demonstrate, their vision of self-sacrifice describes a paradox whereby the expropriation of personal identity is reappropriated {{in the form of a}} negative otherness. While some scholars claim that such self-sacrifice unwittingly endorses the fascist collectivism of the 1930 s, others defend it as an ethical communitarianism resistant to any form of state politics or group identity. My argument subverts this debate by illustrating how their religiosity is based on a theory of endless self-sacrifice, one that continually wavers between personal identity and an unknown, divine alterity. This self-sacrificial mechanism creates new hybrid identities, neither entirely shared nor singular, neither entirely collectivist nor communitarian. As a result, new raced, gendered, sexed, and political identities emerge in literary representations of selfsacrifice that 1) overturn normative political and ethical categories and 2) anticipate contemporary theories of identity formation. As such, this dissertation forcefully urges a reevaluation of established norms in the field concerning the status of religion, community, and personal identity in the French literary avant-garde...|$|R
