5000|$|Apart {{from the}} CRR, banks are {{required}} to maintain liquid assets {{in the form of}} gold, cash and <b>approved</b> <b>securities.</b> Higher liquidity ratio forces commercial banks to maintain a larger proportion of their resources in liquid form and thus reduces their capacity to grant loans and advances, thus it is an anti-inflationary impact. A higher liquidity ratio diverts thebank funds from loans and advances to investment in government and <b>approved</b> <b>securities.</b> In well-developed economies, central banks use open market operations—buying and selling of eligible securities by the central bank in the money market—to influence the volume of cash reserves with commercial banks and thus influence the volume of loans and advances they can make to the commercial and industrial sectors. In the open money market, government securities are traded at market-related rates of interest. The RBI is resorting more to open market operations in the more recent years.
