5|$|Shiban was {{inspired}} to write the episode based on <b>an</b> <b>incident</b> <b>that</b> involved his wife's father potentially seeing other beings in a room when he was dying.

Eventually, the Thunderbird Bowling Centre was chosen.|$|E

The case determined that although there is no absolute right to have publicly funded counsel, in most circumstances a judge should grant any request for an adjournment or stay when an accused is unrepresented. It is {{an important}} case in Australian criminal law, and also in Australian constitutional law, since it is one of many cases in which some members of the High Court have found implied human rights in the Australian Constitution.|$|E

The asylum has many areas, most of which contain a key trap scene for Tapp to solve. A large part of the asylum consists of cells that were at one time used to hold the criminally insane.

5|$|In a 0–0 draw with Wimbledon at Plough Lane hard-man Vinnie Jones singled {{him out for}} attention, and in <b>an</b> <b>incident</b> <b>that</b> {{would become}} a much-publicised photograph, Jones {{grabbed him by the}} {{genitals}} as Gascoigne screamed in agony. Gascoigne subsequently sent Jones a red rose, and the two became good friends.

His first choice was Liverpool but with no offer forthcoming, Gascoigne promised Alex Ferguson that he would sign for Manchester United. Ferguson duly went on holiday to Malta, where he received the news that Gascoigne had signed for Spurs, for a record British fee of £2.2million.

5|$|The Manchester Martyrs– William Philip Allen, Michael Larkin, and Michael O'Brien– {{were members}} of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, an {{organisation}} dedicated to ending British rule in Ireland. They were executed for the murder of a police officer in Manchester, England, in 1867, during <b>an</b> <b>incident</b> <b>that</b> became known as the Manchester Outrages. The trio {{were members of}} a group of 30–40Fenians who attacked a horse-drawn police van transporting two arrested leaders of the Brotherhood, Thomas J. Kelly and Timothy Deasy, to Belle Vue Gaol. Police Sergeant Charles Brett, travelling inside with the keys, was shot and killed as the attackers attempted to force the van open by blowing the lock. Kelly and Deasy were released after another prisoner in the van took the keys from Brett's body and passed them to the group outside through a ventilation grill; the pair were never recaptured, despite an extensive search.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the loss}} of his father, Skelton went to work as early as the age of seven, selling {{newspapers}} and doing other odd jobs to help his family, who had lost the family store and their home.

According to later accounts, Skelton's early interest in becoming an entertainer stemmed from <b>an</b> <b>incident</b> <b>that</b> took place in Vincennes around 1923, when a stranger, supposedly the comedian Ed Wynn, approached Skelton, who was the newsboy selling papers outside a Vincennes theater. When the man asked Skelton what events were going on in town, Skelton suggested he see the new show in town. The man purchased every paper Skelton had, providing enough money for the boy to purchase a ticket for himself. The stranger {{turned out to be one}} of the show's stars, who later took the boy backstage to introduce him to the other performers. The experience prompted Skelton, who had already shown comedic tendencies, to pursue a career as a performer.|$|E
