40|$|This paper {{examines}} the desirability and feasibility of replacing {{the present system}} of personal and corporate income, sales, excise, capital gains, import and export duties, gift and estate taxes with a single comprehensive revenue neutral <b>Automated</b> <b>Payment</b> Transaction (APT) tax. In its simplest form, the APT tax consists of a flat tax levied on all transactions. The tax is automatically assessed and collected when transactions are settled through the electronic technology of the banking/ <b>payments</b> <b>system.</b> The APT tax introduces progressivity through the tax base since the volume of final payments includes exchanges of titles to property and is therefore more highly skewed than the conventional income or consumption tax base. The wealthy carry out {{a disproportionate share of}} total transactions and therefore bear a disproportionate burden of the tax despite its flat rate structure. The automated recording of all APT tax payments by firms and individuals creates a degree of transparency and perceived fairness that induces greater tax compliance. Also, the tax has lower administrative and compliance cost. Like all taxes, the APT tax creates new distortions whose costs must be weighted against the benefits obtained by replacing the current tax system. [...] -Edgar L.

In this thesis, a novel <b>automated</b> <b>payment</b> <b>system</b> based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is proposed. Energy is an important criterion for smartphone applications.

Simulations and experiments with BLE devices are performed to derive an energy model. This model predicts energy consumption and latency for BLE under in uence of interference. The proposed system must be secure against abuse and protect the traveller's privacy. A performance analysis model and a secure, energy-efficient communication protocol are proposed. The model is applied to find that the daily energy requirement for a typical traveller is 12. 6 J or less than 0. 1 % of a smartphone's battery capacity. During the conducted research, no threats to the feasibility of the proposed system were found. The proposed protocol can be implemented to prove the practical feasibility.

This is even more dramatical in healthcare applications where very sensitive information is at stake and patient safety is paramount. In [43], Wu et al. recently proposed a new RFID authentication protocol for healthcare en-vironments. In this paper we show that this protocol puts location privacy of tag holders at risk, which is a matter of gravest concern and ruins the security of this proposal.

They examine factors that have affected system development, planned innovations and improvement opportunities. The principal payment instruments used in Brazil are cash, checks, cobrancas (like European GIRO payments) and DOCs (Documentos de Credito). DOCs are used to make interbank credit payments, intrabank transfers of funds between a client's different accounts and client to client payments between parties with accounts at the same banking institution. Although they can be initiated on paper, all DOCs are electronic and processed only by banks. Networks include direct deposit and direct debit services, automated teller machines, credit cards and home banking services. The system is highly automated, with separate systems for clearing and settling checks and credit payments; government securities, private securities, state, local, and municipal securities; government payments; and foreign exchange.

Radio frequency identification (RFID) can be used in supply chain management, <b>automated</b> <b>payment</b> <b>systems</b> and other daily application as essential technology to enhance lives of human beings. RFID systems are vulnerable for many malicious attacks against privacy and security. To solve these problems, many authentication protocols based on cryptography scheme have been developed in order to ensure preservation of privacy. However, many of the these approaches cannot fully protect privacy in the presence of malicious readers or insider attacks. Our research work in thesis mainly focuses on designing secure RFID authentication schemes with untrace- ability. We observe a number of recent proposed RFID authentication scheme as well as related. Cryptography techniques, and then define the security and privacy requirement for our RFID systems. Our main contribution in this thesis consist proposed RFID authentication.

We review a number of recent proposed RFID authentication protocols as well as related cryptographic techniques, and then de ne the security and privacy requirements for our RFID systems. Our main contributions in this thesis consist of two proposed RFID authentication schemes. The first scheme is a symmetric-key-based authentication scheme for low-cost RFID tags. RFID systems used in this scheme conform to EPCglobal Class- 1 Generation- 2 RFID Speci cation. The work is an improvement of the protocol proposed by Yeh, Wang, Kuo and Wang (YWKW) in 2010. We investigate the YWKW protocol and present the man-in-the-middle attack and the strong tracing attack on their protocol. Our scheme successfully overcomes these drawbacks without impacting the performance advantage. Besides, our scheme achieves both backward untraceability and forward untraceability. In last few years, some basic operations on elliptic curves have been proved applicable for low-cost RFID tags, which make elliptic-curve-based cryptography possible for RFID protocols. We proposed our second scheme constructed on elliptic curves using public-key cryptography. We prove the unforgeability for our scheme in the random oracle model. The security of our scheme is based on the hardness of the Gap Diffie-Hellman problem. We provide a rigorous privacy proof for our scheme based on the Vaudenay 2 ̆ 7 s privacy model. To our knowledge, it is the rst secure elliptic-curve-based authentication protocol that achieves both narrow-destructive and wide-forward privacy.

Compare and analyze them from a security point of view, as well as a usability point of view. What is good? What is bad? What is lacking? To achieve this purpose, an overview of the current on-line payment technologies was acquired through academic books and papers, Internet sites, magazines.
