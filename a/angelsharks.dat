5|$|Using {{mitochondrial}} DNA, a 2010 phylogenetic analysis {{reported that}} the Japanese angelshark forms a clade with the other Asian <b>angelsharks</b> included in the study: the ocellated angelshark (S. tergocellatoides) and the sister species pair of the Taiwan angelshark (S. formosa) and the Indonesian angelshark (S. legnota). These Asian species are, in turn, allied with European and North African angel shark species. Molecular clock estimation suggested the Japanese angelshark lineage diverged {{from the rest of}} the Asian <b>angelsharks</b> some 100 million years ago during the Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|During the day, Pacific <b>angelsharks</b> {{are almost}} {{never seen in}} the open, instead resting {{motionless}} on the sea floor buried under {{a thin layer of}} sediment that disguises their outlines. At night some individuals remain motionless, waiting for prey, while others may be encountered on the bottom unburied or actively swimming. Large sharks, including the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus), and the northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) are known to consume Pacific <b>angelsharks.</b> Known parasites of this species include the copepod Trebius latifurcatus, which infests the skin, the myxosporidian Chloromyxum levigatum, which infests the gall bladder, and the tapeworm Paraberrapex manifestus, which infests the spiral valve intestine. The leech Branchellion lobata may be attached around this shark's cloaca, inside the intestine, and even inside the uterus and on developing embryos.|$|E
5|$|A phylogenetic study {{based on}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA, published by Björn Stelbrink and colleagues in 2010, {{reported that the}} sister species of the Pacific angelshark is the sand devil (S. dumeril) of the western North Atlantic. The two species are estimated to have diverged approximately 6.1 Ma, close to when the Isthmus of Panama first began to form. The authors also found that Pacific <b>angelsharks</b> from the Gulf of California differed genetically from those elsewhere, though they were equivocal as to whether this represented a species-level distinction.|$|E
50|$|Björn Stelbrink and colleagues' 2010 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA, {{found that the}} sister species of the Indonesian <b>angelshark</b> is the Taiwan <b>angelshark</b> (S. formosa); the two were the closest genetically of all the species examined. The pair additionally formed a clade with the Japanese <b>angelshark</b> (S. japonica) and the ocellated <b>angelshark</b> (S. tergocellatoides), both also Asian species.|$|R
50|$|The Mexican <b>angelshark</b> (Squatina mexicana) is {{a species}} of <b>angelshark.</b> It occurs at depths of 70-180 m in the Gulf of Mexico and reaches a length of 88 cm.|$|R
500|$|The <b>angelshark</b> was {{originally}} {{described by the}} Swedish natural historian Carl Linnaeus, known as the [...] "father of taxonomy", in the 1758 tenth edition of Systema Naturae as Squalus squatina. He did not designate a type specimen. The word squatina is the <b>angelshark's</b> name in Latin, derived from the word for skate; it was made the genus name for all angel sharks by the French zoologist André Duméril in 1806. Other common names used for this species include angel, angel fiddle fish, angel puffy fish, angel ray, angelfish, escat jueu, fiddle fish, monk, and monkfish. Stelbrink and colleagues (2010) conducted a phylogenetic study based on mitochondrial DNA, {{and found that the}} sister species of the <b>angelshark</b> is the sawback <b>angelshark</b> (S. aculeata). The two species formed a clade with a number of Asian <b>angelshark</b> species.|$|R
5|$|Although usually sedate and approachable underwater, Pacific <b>angelsharks</b> {{are quick}} to bite if touched, captured, or {{otherwise}} provoked, and can inflict severe lacerations. Commercial fisheries for this species exist off Baja California {{and to a lesser}} extent off California (see below); the meat is considered excellent and is sold fresh or frozen. This species is captured in limited numbers by recreational fishers using hook-and-line, spears, or even by hand, particularly off southern California. It is also taken as bycatch in shrimp trawls operating in the Gulf of California, and processed into fishmeal. The capacity of this species to withstand a focused fishing effort is limited, due to its low rates of reproduction and movement.|$|E
5|$|Pacific <b>angelsharks</b> are not {{dangerous}} to humans unless provoked, {{in which case}} their bite can cause a painful injury. They are valued for their meat and are captured by commercial and recreational fishers across their range. A targeted gillnet fishery for this species began off Santa Barbara, California in 1976 and ended in 1994, after overfishing and new regulations led to its near-collapse. This species is now mainly fished in Mexican waters. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, as the Californian population is largely protected and recovering, while the impact of Mexican fisheries is unknown.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} genetically {{discrete}} subpopulations {{have been identified}} across the northern range of the Pacific angelshark. Several subpopulations exist along the coast from Point Conception northward to Alaska. In the Southern California Bight, {{there are at least}} three separate subpopulations off the mainland and northern and southern Channel Islands. The subpopulation along the Pacific coast of Baja California are distinct from those in the Gulf of California. These subpopulations have diverged from one another over time because Pacific <b>angelsharks</b> do not undertake long migratory movements outside of their preferred home areas, and deep waters serve as effective geographical barriers to population mixing. Heterozygosity, a measure of genetic diversity, is higher in the Pacific angelshark than in other shark species that have been examined.|$|E

5|$|The Pacific {{angelshark}} {{is primarily}} a visual hunter; experiments in nature show that they strike at fish-shaped targets without any electrical, chemical, vibrational, or behavioral cues. At night, they are guided by the bioluminescence of planktonic dinoflagellates and ostracods disturbed by moving prey. This species' visual system is attuned to the wavelengths of light emitted by these planktonic organisms, showing the importance of night hunting. Pacific <b>angelsharks</b> {{are more likely to}} strike at prey approaching from the front. It usually waits until the prey approaches to , as its attack is less accurate beyond this distance. The strike is a stereotyped behavior in which the shark presses the forward lobes of its pectoral fins against the bottom and thrusts its head upwards at up to a 90° angle. Its mouth forms a tube when opened, creating a suction force, while its jaws protude forward to secure the prey between sharp teeth. During the strike, the eyes roll backward into the head for protection. The strike is often completed in under a tenth of a second.|$|E
500|$|Angelshark {{numbers have}} {{declined}} precipitously across {{most of its}} range; it is now believed to be extinct in the North Sea {{and most of the}} northern Mediterranean, and has become extremely rare elsewhere.

500|$|<b>Angelsharks</b> are aplacental viviparous, {{meaning the}} young hatch inside the mother's uterus and are nourished by a yolk sac until birth. Females have two {{functional}} ovaries, {{with the right}} ovary containing more oocytes and the right uterus correspondingly containing more embryos; this functional asymmetry is not present in other angel shark species. Unlike most sharks, in which vitellogenesis (yolk formation) occurs concurrently with pregnancy, in the angelshark, the onset of vitellogenesis is delayed until halfway through the gestation period. The mature ova measure [...] across and are not enclosed in a capsule. The reproductive cycle has been estimated at 2 years with ovulation taking place in spring, though this periodicity is ill-defined. The litter size ranges from seven to 25 and is correlated {{with the size of}} the mother; the young are gestated for 8–10 months. Parturition occurs from December to February in the Mediterranean and in July off England, with the newborns measuring [...] long. Males and females mature at lengths of [...] and , respectively.|$|E
