5|$|In 1969 {{the town}} was {{featured}} {{as the title of}} the fourth album Keynsham by the Bonzo Dog Band. The title was chosen in honour of Horace Batchelor, who had been referenced in previous Bonzo Dog Band recordings. In the early 1960s, Batchelor became known through his regular advertisements on Radio Luxembourg for his football pools prediction service. When giving his contact address, he would slowly spell out 'Keynsham' letter by letter, and this became <b>an</b> <b>amusing</b> feature for many young listeners.|$|E

25|$|Lauded as {{a future}} party leader, in late 1906 he went to America, {{participating}} {{in a number of}} propaganda and fund-raising meetings.

25|$|Orwell wrote a {{critique}} of George Bernard Shaw's play Arms and the Man. He considered this Shaw's best play and {{the most likely to}} remain socially relevant, because of its theme that war is not, generally speaking, a glorious romantic adventure. His 1945 essay In Defense of P.G. Wodehouse contains <b>an</b> <b>amusing</b> assessment of Wodehouse's writing and also argues that his broadcasts from Germany (during the war) did not really make him a traitor. He accused The Ministry of Information of exaggerating Wodehouse's actions for propaganda purposes.|$|E

25|$|First editorship {{consisted}} of journalists from Politika, headed by Vladislav Ribnikar, Dušan Timotijević and Živojin Vukadinović. They {{were among the}} enthusiasts who were gathering Serbian intellectual left wing during the late 1930s. They had the idea about making <b>an</b> <b>amusing</b> newspaper containing novels, short stories and comic strips. On 31 December 1938 Politika came out with an open competition {{for the name of}} new edition. Between 34,998 coupons that arrived, one fifth voted for the name Politikin Zabavnik (Politika's Entertainer) among other suggestions. The magazine's first issue was published on 28 February 1939. It was issued in the form of Berliner newspaper (31×47cm). It had 12 pages printed in black and white. Four of them were printed with addition of red color and its undertones. The concept of Politikin Zabavnik was balanced relation between comics and texts, such as novels, stories and interesting facts.|$|E

Most enjoyable, but too bad Eaton's part isn't longer and that Fröbe's Goldfinger, a heavy but nimble intellectual in the Sydney Greenstreet tradition, never appeared in another Bond film." ...|$|E

500|$|The Apology was {{a popular}} work and gave Cibber a good return. Its self-complacency, however, infuriated some of his contemporaries, notably Pope, but even the usually {{critical}} Samuel Johnson {{had to admit that}} it was [...] "very entertaining and very well done". It went through four editions in his lifetime, and more after his death, and generations of readers have found it <b>an</b> <b>amusing</b> and engaging read, projecting an author always [...] "happy in his own good opinion, the best of all others; teeming with animal spirits, and uniting the self-sufficiency of youth with the garrulity of age." ...|$|E

500|$|Rescued by Rover is a 1905 British short silent drama film, {{directed}} by Lewin Fitzhamon, about a dog who leads its master to his kidnapped baby, {{which was the}} first to feature the Hepworth's family dog Blair in a starring role; following the release, the dog became a household name and he is considered to be the first dog film star. The film, which according to Michael Brooke of BFI Screenonline, [...] "marks a key stage in the medium's development from <b>an</b> <b>amusing</b> novelty to the seventh art," [...] and, [...] "possibly the only point in film history when British cinema unquestionably led the world," [...] was an advance in filming techniques, editing, production and story telling.|$|E
500|$|The book sold well at release, {{but is now}} {{considered}} one of Potter's weakest productions. Potter never observed the tale's indigenous North American mammals in nature, and, as a result, her depictions are thought stiff and unnatural. Other elements in the story have come under fire: the rhymes, for example, reveal nothing about the characters nor do they provide <b>an</b> <b>amusing</b> game for the child reader {{in the manner of}} the rhymes in The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin. The storm in the finale is viewed as a weak plot device introduced solely to hurry the tale to its conclusion, and the marriage of the chipmunks has been described as [...] "abrasive and shocking" [...] and an impediment to the flow of the tale.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Michelle Golberg {{suggested}} {{in a review}} for The Nation that the film's popularity with critics was not due to its quality but rather its taboo subject matter: [...] "If the ordinary drama of abortion were more regularly represented in the movies, Obvious Child wouldn't be much more than <b>an</b> <b>amusing</b> hipster diversion." [...] Kate Taylor of The Globe and Mail expressed a similar sentiment and opined {{that many of the}} film's jokes were crude and lacking in humor. USA Today Scott Bowles also found Obvious Child unfunny, describing the characters as [...] "so morbid and whiny that the jokes don't work, even as irony". Kyle Smith, a critic for the New York Post, found the plot uninteresting and the cinematography [...] "ugly", and criticized Slate's [...] "desperate" [...] performance.|$|E
