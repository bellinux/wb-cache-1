40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the outcome of}} an ascending-price multiple-unit auction. Two bidders, facing continuous, downward-sloping demand functions, participate in the auction of some divisible objects. The auctioneer starts the process by announcing an initial price and asking both bidders to submit sealed-bids of desired quantities. The auctioneer increases the price until the total <b>amount</b> <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> {{is less than the}} total supply. We compute the outcome of this auction game under full information and suggest that this mechanism may not maximize expected revenue. Copyright © 1996 Published by Elsevier Science B. V...|$|E
25|$|After all tricks are taken, {{counters}} are tallied {{for each}} player. The three discards by {{the highest bidder}} count toward their counter score for the hand, so {{there is always a}} total of 250 points for the trick score among the three players. If the highest bidder fails to make their contract by adding meld points and trick points from the play, then their score is negative the <b>amount</b> of the <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> that hand.|$|R

Advertisers are interested in making use of this vast business potential, as very clear intent signal communicated through an issued query allows effective targeting of users. This idea is embodied in a sponsored search model, where each advertiser maintains a list of keywords they deem in-dicative of increased user response rate with regards to their business. According to this targeting model, when a query is issued all advertisers with a matching keyword are en-tered into an auction according to the <b>amount</b> they <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the query and the winner gets to show their ad.

40|$|William Vickrey (1961) {{proposed}} an auction mechanism in which bidders submit sealed bids, {{and the highest}} bidder wins the good {{in return for payment}} of the second-highest <b>bid</b> <b>amount.</b> <b>For</b> decades, economists have credited Vickrey with inventing this auction format, and have believed that the Vickrey auction is rarely used in practice. This paper presents evidence that Vickrey auctions have long been the predominant auction format for mail sales of collectible postage stamps. Stamp auctioneers developed this auction format on their own, as early as 1893, even before Vickrey was born. ...|$|R

40|$|Several {{indivisible}} {{goods are}} to be divided among two or more players, whose <b>bids</b> <b>for</b> the goods determine their prices. An equitable assignment of the goods at competitive prices is given by a fair-division procedure, called the Gap Procedure, that ensures (1) nonnegative prices that never exceed the bid of the player receiving the good; (2) Pareto optimality, though coupled with possible envy; (3) monotonicity, such that higher bids never hurt in obtaining a good; (4) sincere bids that preclude negative utility; and (5) prices that are partially independent of the <b>amounts</b> <b>bid</b> (as in a Vickrey auction). A variety of applications are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|A sealed-bid {{combinatorial}} auction {{is developed}} for the allocation of airport time slots to competing airlines. This auction procedure permits airlines to submit various contingency <b>bids</b> <b>for</b> flight-compatible combinations of individual airport landing or take-off slots. An algorithm for solving the resulting set-packing problem yields an allocation of slots to packages that maximizes the system surplus as revealed by the set of package bids submitted. The algorithm determines individual (slot) resource prices which are used to price packages to the winning bidders at levels guaranteed to be no greater (and normally smaller) than the <b>amounts</b> <b>bid.</b> Laboratory experiments with cash motivated subjects are used to study the efficiency and demand revelation properties of the combinatorial auction in comparison with a proposed independent slot primary auction. ...|$|R

50|$|A sort of {{forerunner of}} Family Feud, the game {{involved}} two five-member teams of families, each starting {{the game with}} 200 points.

50|$|Companies and {{charities}} can {{not only}} raise money through online auctions, but create awareness for a specific cause or charity. Online auction bidders can view photos, descriptions and suggested bids of items online, as opposed to items in a showroom. Most online auctions use a style of bidding called proxy bidding, in which the online system makes <b>bids</b> <b>for</b> the actual participant in increments up to the maximum <b>bidding</b> <b>amount</b> set by the participant.|$|R
40|$|In {{a one-sided}} {{ascending}} combinatorial auction, bidders place bids on packages of items. When values are interdependent, multi-round auctions are employed to allow price discovery. In such designs, bidders desire {{feedback on the}} estimated prices of items and packages in each round. In addition, prices are often used to set the minimum acceptable <b>bid</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>for</b> the next round. Due to the combinatorial nature of the winner determination problem, determining the prices of the individual items is not straightforward. The ascending proxy auction (Ausubel-Milgrom, 2001) has been proposed as a design, where the minimum acceptable <b>bid</b> <b>amounts</b> are a very small increment above the previous high bid on an item or package. These translate to nonlinear and non-anonymous (bidder specific) pricing. When agents are substitutes and the buyer sub-modularity condition is satisfied, the ascending proxy design achieves an efficient outcome at minimum competitive equilibrium prices. But the requirement for an infinitesimally small increment size, results in an auction with {{a very large number}} of rounds. In this paper, we propose two alternative linearpricing schemes that use the game-theoretic concept of the nucleolus to provide price estimates for each item and to determine minimum acceptable <b>bid</b> <b>amounts.</b> We study the effects of such pricing on the length of the auction, the efficiency of the outcome and the prices paid by the winning bidders. We use the linear pricing schemes in an ascending proxy auction framework and benchmark the results against an ascending proxy auction and a faster-to-compute variant of this algorithm that we label the “accelerated proxy auction design”. We also compare our results with those obtained using previously proposed linear pricing schemes...|$|R

50|$|Advertisers pay {{for each}} single click they receive, {{with the actual}} amount paid based on the <b>amount</b> of <b>bid.</b> It is common {{practice}} amongst auction hosts to charge a winning bidder just slightly more (e.g. one penny) than the next highest bidder or the actual <b>amount</b> <b>bid,</b> whichever is lower.
