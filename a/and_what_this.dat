500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News {{on the set of}} the video shoot, Drake said, [...] "I've shot a lot of videos before, but this is my first attempt to establish myself as Drake the artist." [...] Confronting the criticism of his past videos, notably the one for [...] "Best I Ever Had", Drake said, [...] "I really don't care what other people think about them, they were great experiences for me. I've learned a lot from them", and he explained that he was working on that day with Mandler, someone he respects and looks up to. On the video, Drake said, [...] "We talked colors, we talked epic, emotion-evoking visuals." [...] He called the story of the video interesting and the song tells [...] "sort of a love story". He explained that the video {{has a lot to do}} with his debut album, stating [...] "The album is about finding love, feeling 'Have I sold my soul' as far as 'Will I ever be able to gain the trust of a woman? Will I only be able to be around the dark, evil women? Will I ever find that pure love?' Those elements are in the video." [...] In a separate interview on his Away From Home Tour, with MTV News, Drake said the video takes the song to [...] "another place". He said it offers up a different look to the song. He explained, [...] "This video is what I was really thinking about. The song is like a bad dream — but it's not a bad dream, it's not a terrible dream. It's a little evil. The video really reflects that. It's a struggle between the purities of my past life <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> new life has to offer. Even in the video, you see me looking back and forth between the two and deciding. At the end of the video I don't necessarily make a decision, but when you get the album, you'll see what choice I make." ...|$|E
2500|$|In her {{process of}} {{evaluating}} our relationships with computers, Turkle interviews children, college students, engineers, AI scientists, hackers and personal computer owners {{in order to}} further understand our relationships with computers and how we interact with them on a personal level. [...] The interviews showed that computers are both a part of our selves as well as part of the external world. [...] In this book, Turkle tries to figure out why we think of computers in such psychological terms, how this happens <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> means for all of us.|$|E

2500|$|... "In this context," [...] Pope continued, [...] "it {{would appear}} that {{manifest}} disregard of the law must be something beyond and different from a mere error in the law or failure {{on the part of}} the arbitrators to understand or apply the law." [...] He then considered the Bernhardt footnote <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> would mean. [...] "We apprehend that a manifest disregard of the law in the context of the language used in Wilko v. Swan ... might be present when arbitrators understand and correctly state the law, but proceed to disregard the same," [...] he wrote. [...] "We think this is the sort of thing the Court had in mind in United Steelworkers".|$|E
2500|$|In {{each of our}} models, we {{calculate}} both hue <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> {{article will}} call chroma, after Joblove and Greenberg (1978), in the same way—that is, the hue of a color has the same numerical values {{in all of these}} models, as does its chroma. If we take our tilted RGB cube, and project it onto the [...] "chromaticity plane" [...] perpendicular to the neutral axis, our projection takes the shape of a hexagon, with red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and magenta at its corners (...) [...] Hue is roughly the angle of the vector to a point in the projection, with red at 0°, while chroma is roughly the distance of the point from the origin.|$|E
2500|$|The UK Independence Party's Nigel Farage congratulated Trump by praising his {{campaign}} and his [...] "post-Brexit values." [...] Farage supported Trump's candidacy throughout {{the general election}} and even spoke at a rally of his on one occasion. He met Trump in New York City on November 12 and wrote on Twitter that Trump [...] "was relaxed and full of good ideas. I'm confident {{he will be a}} good President." [...] He also said of Trump’s support for {{relations between the two countries}} [...] "very strong" [...] and that he was the man the U.K. [...] "can do business" [...] with. Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway confirmed the meeting and said: [...] "I think they enjoy each other's company, and they actually had a chance to talk about freedom and winning <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> all means for the world." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stratfor {{suggested}} {{financial market}} disruption {{is due to}} the political upheaval. Predrag Dukic, senior equity sales trader at CM Capital Markets Bolsa, wrote: [...] "The independence movement seeks to paralyze the region with strikes, disobedience, etc., a nightmare scenario for what until yesterday seemed a strong Spanish economic recovery." [...] Markus Schomer, chief global economist at PineBridge Investments, suggested that the uncertainty both in and outside of Spain has made it hard to price the scenarios into final markets so far. Further he commented a strong approval could result in a euro 0.0255% sell off, just as {{in the aftermath of the}} German federal election the previous week. [...] "I don’t think there is an immediate change coming from that referendum. It'll take quite a bit longer to assess where this is going <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> will mean, how the EU will react, how the Spanish government will react. So I don't think you'll see people adjusting their portfolios on Monday, but you could get the classic knee-jerk, risk-off reaction." ...|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{historians have}} very {{different}} ideas regarding the authorship of A General History <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> attribution means for historiography. [...] As many historians point out, A General History of the Pyrates {{set the tone for}} every work on pirates that has been written since. [...] Since the attribution, there have been three schools of thought concerning the subject: those who agree with Moore's conclusions, those who do not, and even some who do not think that it matters. [...] Prior to Furbank and Owens' work on Defoe's canon, some scholars accepted that Defoe authored A General History, while others postulated that authorship does not matter. [...] Interestingly, however, some people, still believed that Defoe was the author. Some scholars compared the work to other records and sources from the time and concluded that A General History is highly significant for its amount of accuracy, regardless of attribution. [...] What is most important about this work is not who penned it, but that it represents what people thought about pirates in the early eighteenth century.|$|E
2500|$|Others doubted whether recent {{graduates}} had {{the necessary}} skills and maturity {{for such a}} task. The idea was popular among students, however, and Kennedy pursued it, asking respected academics such as Max Millikan and Chester Bowles to help him outline the organization and its goals. During his inaugural address, Kennedy again promised to create the program: [...] "And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you—ask {{what you can do}} for your country". President Kennedy in a speech at the White House on June 22, 1962, [...] "Remarks to Student Volunteers Participating in Operation Crossroads Africa", acknowledged that Operation Crossroads for Africa was the basis {{for the development of the}} Peace Corps. [...] "This group and this effort really were the progenitors of the Peace Corps <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> organization has been doing for a number of years led to the establishment of what I consider to be the most encouraging indication of the desire for service not only in this country but all around the world that we have seen in recent years". The Peace Corps website answered the question [...] "Who Inspired the Creation of the Peace Corps?", acknowledging that the Peace Corps were based on Operation Crossroads Africa founded by Rev. James H. Robinson.|$|E
