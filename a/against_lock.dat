25|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the search and recovery efforts, government officials confirmed that a gate blocking access to the road on which the Kims were stranded should have been locked, but was not.

50|$|However, {{there is}} one fault that is {{difficult}} to deal with in a parallel arrangement: the locking up of one actuator element. Because parallel actuator elements always have the same extension, one locked-up element can render the whole assembly useless. It is possible to mitigate this by guarding the elements <b>against</b> <b>locking</b> or by limiting the force exerted by a single element. But these measures reduce both the effectiveness of the system and introduce new points of failure.|$|R

In 1914 Snodgrass mounted a strong campaign <b>against</b> <b>Lock,</b> citing his failure to meet his election promises. Lock, with support from some councillors, mounted an equally strong campaign against Snodgrass, {{making it one of}} the fiercest election battles the city had seen. The final count was so close (5 votes) that it took a further week before the outcome was confirmed. Lock won by 1050 votes to Snodgrass' 1045.|$|E

50|$|Shortly after Lock's plight {{was made}} public, insurer NTUC Income's CEO Tan Suee Chieh offered to waive the costs awarded <b>against</b> <b>Lock</b> {{and give him}} $25,000 to settle his legal costs {{as a gesture of}} goodwill, on the {{condition}} that Lock dropped his stated intention to appeal. Initially overjoyed, Lock was billed S$80,000 by his lawyer, Andrew Hanam, shortly after his dismissal, so he decided to turn down the offer and to proceed to the Court of Appeal, the highest court in the jurisdiction of Singapore. He also filed a civil suit against his former lawyer alleging that he provided inadequate professional services, in response to which the latter filed a counter-suit for defamation.|$|E
50|$|During the American Civil War, Michigan {{was armed}} with a 30-pounder Parrott rifle, five 20-pounder Parrott rifles, six 24-pounder smoothbores, and two 12-pounder boat howitzers. The Confederate States of America {{considered}} launching attacks against the North from Canada. Early in 1863, Lieutenant William Henry Murdaugh, CSN, planned to lead a group of Confederate naval officers to Canada where they would purchase a small steamer, man her with Canadians and steam to Erie to board Michigan and use her <b>against</b> <b>locks</b> and shipping on the Great Lakes.

5000|$|The initial {{shock of}} firing was absorbed by a hydro-spring mechanism, {{allowing}} 34 inches of recoil within the gun mounting. The remaining recoil energy was absorbed {{by allowing the}} entire railway wagon to roll backwards 40 feet (Vickers carriage) or 3-4 yards (Armstrong carriage) <b>against</b> <b>locked</b> brakes. This [...] "rolling recoil" [...] system allowed the gun to be operated without the need to construct a pit with a strong static platform below the gun for it to recoil into and to allow transmission of all the recoil force directly {{to the ground as}} was typical of many large US and French railway guns.|$|R

2500|$|In 1997, Petrelis helped {{organize}} {{a campaign to}} reopen the bathhouses, after San Francisco Board of Supervisors member Tom Ammiano proposed an ordinance to license and regulate the city's sex clubs, thereby codifying previously voluntary guidelines. Petrelis opposed the measure as an unwarranted government intrusion into the sex lives of gay men. Among the voluntary guidelines to be codified by the legislation was a prohibition <b>against</b> <b>locked</b> doors, behind which patrons might engage in unprotected anal intercourse. San Francisco health officials considered the availability of such private spaces to be a distinguishing characteristic of the bathhouses the city had worked to close, and keep closed, since 1984. The debate over the proposed legislation led some activists to demand reopening the bathhouses. Petrelis said, [...] "...I {{think that there are}} mature gay men who know how to make decisions behind closed doors."
