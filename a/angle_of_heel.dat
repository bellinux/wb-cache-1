25|$|At 9:06a.m., the Jindo VTS were {{informed}} of the capsizing incident by the Mokpo Coast Guard. Around this time, the crew began communicating with the Jindo VTS, which was closer to their location. For the next two minutes, Jindo VTS alerted two other ships that Sewol was sinking, with one confirming that it had visual contact with the ship. At 9:07a.m., Sewols crew confirmed that the ferry was capsizing and requested {{the help of the}} Coast Guard. At 9:14a.m., the crew stated that the ship's <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel</b> made evacuation impossible. Around this time, the captain of Patrol Vessel 123 was appointed the commander of the scene. Four minutes afterwards, the crew of Sewol reported to the VTS that the ferry had heeled more than 50 degrees to port.|$|E

Captain Schettino has said various instruments were not functioning. Reports differ whether the ship listed to port soon after the impact and when she began listing to starboard. At 22:10, the vessel turned south. The vessel was then listing to starboard, initially by about 20°, coming to rest by 22:44 at Punta del Gabbianara in about 20 metres of water at an <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel</b> of about 70°. Captain Schettino attributes the final grounding of the ship at Punta del Gabbianara to his own effort to manoeuvre the ship there. In contrast, on 3 February, {{the chief of the}} Italian Coast Guard testified that the final grounding of the ship at Punta del Gabbianara may not have been related to any attempts to manoeuvre the ship and the ship may have drifted simply due to the prevailing winds that night.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} whether the minima in hydrodynamic resistance can be predicted to occur at the same <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel</b> and trim in the case of bare hull towing tank tests, bare hull simulations and appendage and leeway simulations. If so, the appendages and the leeway can be rejected from future investigations, which would prove a beneficial advancement, as they impose further complexity to simulations. The results of verification and validation (V&V) included in this paper demonstrate that the numerical method predicted too low resistance. Though the study identifies and systematically investigates possible sources of error, the major source of error was not found. These various possible sources of errors were identified for further research, and as future references for similar cases. Moreover, the simulation results for the variations <b>of</b> <b>heel</b> and trim also require further study. Before a full set of results is available, one cannot make conclusions regarding the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel</b> and trim that lead to minimal resistance.

50|$|At some {{angle of}} loll (say 10°), KM will {{increase}} sufficiently equal to KG (distance from the keel {{to the center}} of gravity), thus making GM of vessel equal to zero. When this occurs, the vessel goes to neutral equilibrium, and the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel</b> at which it happens is called angle of loll.In other words, when an unstable vessel heels over towards a progressively increasing <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel,</b> at a certain <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel,</b> the center of buoyancy (B) may fall vertically below the center of gravity (G). Angle of list {{should not be confused with}} angle of loll. Angle of list is caused by unequal loading on either side of center line of vessel.|$|E
50|$|Angle of loll is {{the state}} of a ship that is {{unstable}} when upright (i.e. has a negative metacentric height) and therefore takes on an <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel</b> to either port or starboard.|$|E

5000|$|The loss of [...] in September 1871 led to {{concerns}} about the stability of turret ships, and a special committee {{was set up to}} determine their seaworthiness. Changes to the design were recommended. The freeboard of the design was increased to 10 ft. Another change was to extend the armoured breastwork with unarmoured structure to the sides of the ship and carried aft to improve the stability at large <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel.</b> This greatly improved the crew comfort by adding extra accommodation and especially latrines, but since it was not armoured it would have been riddled in a battle, reducing the stability of the vessel.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} girth {{measurements}}, all measurements were basically point measurements. This {{meant that the}} hull was often locally distorted to maximise or minimise a measurement locally, with minimal effect to the surrounding hull. This gave a characteristic bumped look to many boats, particularly {{at the point of}} maximum beam and in the stern. Also, as stability was only measured at very low heel angles (less than 5 degrees), boats were designed with a very narrow waterline and low stability in measurement trim, but a hull form that gained stability with the weight of the crew and other equipment, and with increasing <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel.</b> Interestingly, low stability was encouraged (up to a point) because the initial assumption was that low stability indicated a well fitted out interior, and so more of a cruising boat than a stripped out racer.|$|R
50|$|It {{emerged that}} the ship had a maximum righting moment at an <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel</b> around 18 degrees. If she was pushed over beyond this angle, the moment declined. By contrast, Monarch had a maximum {{restoring}} force at an angle of 40 degrees, so that any heel up to this limit would always meet increasing resistance.|$|E
5000|$|Where RM is the righting moment, GZ is the righting arm and [...] is the {{displacement}}. Because {{the vessel}} displacement is constant, common practice {{is to simply}} graph the righting arm vs the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel.</b> The righting arm (known also as GZ — see diagram): the horizontal distance between the lines of buoyancy and gravity.|$|E

50|$|When a ship <b>heels,</b> {{the centre}} <b>of</b> {{buoyancy}} {{of the ship}} moves laterally. It might also move up or down {{with respect to the}} water line. The point at which a vertical line through the <b>heeled</b> centre <b>of</b> buoyancy crosses the line through the original, vertical centre of buoyancy is the metacentre. The metacentre remains directly above the centre of buoyancy by definition. In the diagram, the two Bs show the centres of buoyancy of a ship in the upright and heeled conditions, and M is the metacentre. The metacentre is considered to be fixed for small <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> heel; however, at larger <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel,</b> the metacentre can no longer be considered fixed, and its actual location must be found to calculate the ship's stability.The metacentre can be calculated using the formulae:Where KB is the centre of buoyancy (height above the keel), I is the Second moment of area of the waterplane in metres4 and V is the volume of displacement in metres3. KM is the distance from the keel to the metacentre.|$|R
40|$|Sailing the Laser dinghy {{will be an}} Olympic {{discipline}} at the 2016 summer Olympic Games in Rio. The Olympic motto reads: Higher - faster - stronger. For competitive sailing nowadays {{this means}} using scientific measures to improve boat speed and distance made good. This thesis {{is a part of}} Chlamers' sports technology effort which aims at improving of developing certain sports. This thesis in particular is undertaken in the aim at gaining insights on the parameters that affect the hydrodynamic resistance of the hull of the Laser dinghy. Gaining knowledge in how to minimize resistance will in turn provide the sailors with instructions of how to sail better. Investigations of this kind have never been done before on any dinghy, this increases the potential for an advantage for the Swedish sailors. As the Laser is a strict one-design class no means of design change is possible. The overall goal of the sports project is to improve the performance of the sailors. The purpose of this thesis is to see if the minima in resistance can be predicted to occur at the same <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel</b> and trim for: bare hull towing tank tests, bare hull simulations and appendage and leeway simulations. If this is the case the appendages and the leeway can be rejected from future investigations of this kind. This would be beneficial as they impose further complexity to the simulations. To get direct instructions of how to sail according to the results obtain in this thesis, more work than presented here is needed. Towing tank tests performed at SSPA in Gothenborg are the input and the starting point of this thesis. The test were performed for variations <b>of</b> speed and <b>heel</b> and trim angles, for a bare hull. In {{the first phase of the}} project, a verification and validation, V&V, analysis is achieved to gain confidence in the CFD simulations run in the Shipflow software. The verification is done to display and effect of the grid on the outcome of the simulation, the procedure is called grid dependence study. The V&V was done for one test case with 4 kts boat speed. The second part of the thesis work was to run simulations with similar conditions as in the towing tank and then validate the results against the towing tank test data. This was done for heel and trim variations at 3 and 4 kts. The third part was to include the effect of appendages and the leeway to the simulations, and then see if the resistance minima occurred for the same <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel</b> and trim. The results from the V&V study showed that the numerical method predicted a too low resistance. Possible sources of error were identified and systematically investigated but the major source of error was not found. However some possibilities are explained and ruled out for future reference. Furthermore, not all simulations for the investigation were finished or did not provide satisfactory and reliable results. Having an incomplete set of results, conclusions on the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel</b> and trim leading to minimal resistance could not be made. A discussion about what needs to be done in order to reach those objectives, and what could improve a study like this one in the future, is given in the end of this report...|$|R
40|$|Evacuation {{analysis}} of passenger and commercial shipping can be undertaken using computer-based simulation {{tools such as}} maritimeEXODUS. These tools emulate human shipboard behaviour during emergency scenarios; however it is largely based around the behaviour of civilian passengers and fixtures and fittings of merchant vessels. If these tools and procedures are {{to be applied to}} naval vessels there is a clear requirement to understand the behaviour of well-trained naval personnel interacting with the fixtures and fittings that are exclusive to warships. Human factor trials using Royal Navy training facilities were recently undertaken to collect data to improve our understanding of the performance of naval personnel in warship environments. The trials were designed and conducted by staff from the Fire Safety Engineering Group (FSEG) of the University of Greenwich on behalf of the Sea Technology Group (STG), Defence Procurement Agency. The trials involved a selection of RN volunteers with sea-going experience in warships, operating and traversing structural components under different <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel.</b> This paper describes the trials and some of the collected data...|$|R
50|$|The {{severity}} of a capsize {{depends on the}} size and design of a vessel. A small dinghy is designed to capsize and be righted by her crew. Yachts are typically built to right themselves even if heeled over beyond 90 degrees. However a large sailing ship will typically lose all stability at a smaller <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel,</b> and will be vulnerable to downflooding and sinking if heeled beyond this point.|$|E

Modern boats are built with both the symmetrical spinnaker, or the I-20 version with an asymmetrical spinnaker. Because of the hull configuration, at a substantial <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel,</b> it is similar to having a catamaran on one hull: the ratio of water line length to breadth increases dramatically, along with a geometric increase in speed.|$|E
5000|$|Gaff rig {{features}} fore-and-aft sails {{shaped like}} a triangle minus its point, the upper edge of which is made fast to a spar called a gaff. The top of the sail tends to twist away from the wind reducing its efficiency when close-hauled. However, due to the gaff on {{the top edge of}} the sail the centre of effort is typically lower, somewhat reducing the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel</b> (leaning of the boat caused by wind force on the sails) compared to a similar sized Bermuda rigged sail.|$|E
40|$|The {{problems}} {{of determining the}} stability and control derivatives of small subsonic UAV in the longitudinal channel are solved. An approach to the stability and control derivatives determination based on the analysis results of wind tunnel investigation and analyzes conducted. To the longitudinal movement usually referred traffic aircraft where {{it is in the}} plane of symmetry of one and the same vertical plane. Thus the aerodynamic lateral force, rolling moment and yaw <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel</b> and slip and angular velocity of roll and glide zero. To investigate the longitudinal motion of the aircraft (movement in the longitudinal channel) important issue is to determine the components of the aerodynamic forces and moments {{as a function of the}} kinematic parameters of the flight, the so-called aerodynamic derivatives. Given that the object is a lightweight UAV that has subsonic range of operating speeds, significantly less than the speed of sound, it should be noted that the derivative of the coefficient of lift coefficient and drag coefficient for longitudinal moment of flight speed can be taken to be zero at subsonic speed range. This is due to the fact that these values are almost constant with airspeed, lower the speed of sound. Change the value of these parameters with growth rate appears only when approaching the speed of sound, due to changes in the position of the center of pressure and the additional impedance. Also, when calculating stability derivatives are generally neglected by changing the drag because the drag value of derivatives are small and commensurate with the error of the calculation methods. Derivatives of lift coefficient by the following kinematic parameters: <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack, the angular velocity of rotation around the transverse axis, rate <b>of</b> change <b>of</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack and <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> elevator deflection are defined. Obtained results make it possible to analyze the movement of the UAV in the longitudinal channel and determinate the coefficients of a mathematical model of the UAV. Also possible to determinate the stability and controllability of the UAV during automatic control systems design. ??????????? ??????? ??????????? ??????????? ???????????? ? ????????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????? ?????????? ????? ? ????? ?????????? ????????? ?????? ? ?????????? ??????. ????????? ????????-????????????? ?????? ? ??????????? ??????????? ???????????? ? ????????????? ?? ?????? ??????? ??????????? ???????? ??????? ? ???????????????? ????? ? ??????????? ????????????? ????????????. ?????????? ?????????? ???? ??????????? ????????????? ???????? ???? ? ?????????? ??????, ?????????? ???????????? ?????????????? ?????? ????, ?????????? ?????????????? ???????????? ? ????????????? ???? ??? ?????????????? ?????? ??????????????? ??????????...|$|R

Twenty experts and twenty unskilled skiers were recruited for the study. All expert skiers held the certificates issued by the Korea Ski Instructors Association. A three-dimensional motion capture system and two inertial sensors were used to acquire joint movements, heel acceleration and heel angular velocity during ski simulator exercises. Pattern variation values were calculated to assess the variations in ski simulator motion of expert and unskilled skiers.

5000|$|The {{metacentre}} has {{a direct}} relationship with a ships rolling period. A ship with a small GM will be [...] "tender" [...] - have a long roll period. An excessively low or negative GM {{increases the risk of}} a ship capsizing in rough weather, for example HMS Captain or the Vasa. It also puts the vessel at risk of potential for large <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel</b> if the cargo or ballast shifts, such as with the Cougar Ace. A ship with low GM is less safe if damaged and partially flooded because the lower metacentric height leaves less safety margin. For this reason, maritime regulatory agencies such as the International Maritime Organization specify minimum safety margins for seagoing vessels. A larger metacentric height on the other hand can cause a vessel to be too [...] "stiff"; excessive stability is uncomfortable for passengers and crew. This is because the stiff vessel quickly responds to the sea as it attempts to assume the slope of the wave. An overly stiff vessel rolls with a short period and high amplitude which results in high angular acceleration. This increases the risk of damage to the ship and to cargo and may cause excessive roll in special circumstances where eigenperiod of wave coincide with eigenperiod of ship roll. Roll damping by bilge keels of sufficient size will reduce the hazard. Criteria for this dynamic stability effect remain to be developed. In contrast, a [...] "tender" [...] ship lags behind the motion of the waves and tends to roll at lesser amplitudes. A passenger ship will typically have a long rolling period for comfort, perhaps 12 seconds while a tanker or freighter might have a rolling period of 6 to 8 seconds.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} fin keel, pointing {{straight down}} from the boat, provides no righting moment when the boat is level. The heeling force of the wind on the sails is therefore not counteracted until the boat has heeled over by a certain amount, moving the fixed keel to windward of the centerline. The purpose of the canting keel is to allow the boat to sail closer to level which generates maximum speed, by swinging the keel to windward and developing an adequate righting moment to keep the boat's <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel</b> closer to level.|$|E
50|$|At {{a stable}} <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel</b> (for a sailboat) {{and a steady}} speed, {{aerodynamic}} and hydrodynamic forces are in balance. Integrated over the sailing craft, the total aerodynamic force (FT) {{is located at the}} centre of effort (CE), which {{is a function of the}} design and adjustment of the sails on a sailing craft. Similarly, the total hydrodynamic force (Fl) is located at the centre of lateral resistance (CLR), which is a function of the design of the hull and its underwater appendages (keel, rudder, foils, etc.). These two forces act in opposition to one another with Fl a reaction to FT.|$|E
50|$|The righting {{couple on}} the ship is {{proportional}} to the horizontal distance between two equal forces. These are gravity acting downwards at the centre of mass and the same magnitude force acting upwards through the centre of buoyancy, and through the metacentre above it. The righting couple {{is proportional to the}} metacentric height multiplied by the sine of the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel,</b> hence the importance of metacentric height to stability. As the hull rights, work is done either by its centre of mass falling, or by water falling to accommodate a rising centre of buoyancy, or both.|$|E
50|$|Heels are villainous or {{antagonistic}} characters, whose personalities are crafted {{to elicit}} a negative {{response from the}} audience.

40|$|Capsizing {{of small}} vessels, such as {{commercial}} fishing vessels, {{is a frequent}} event. This phenomenon is generally associated with the combined action of storm seas, inadequate design parameter regulations, and dangerous operational procedures. In contrast, the capsizing of large ships is rare, but does occur. For these large vessels, more strict regulations exist to ensure safe operational procedures. While the storminess of the sea cannot be controlled, the navigation procedure can. Large offshore ships tend to navigate in a path to avoid forecasted severe weather, and in cases of stormy seas they temporarily operate at safe speeds and in the direction parallel to the waves. The work presented in this thesis investigates {{the effect of the}} wind in rolling and finally capsizing a ship. For the purposes of mechanical analysis, realistic hull forms are used and fundamental issues associated with moments and forces imposed by the wind, are applied. The platforms are examined for several wind speeds that strike the ship at different angles. Both static and dynamic cases were examined. Under the assumption of general conditions, the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>heeling</b> in each case and the wind speeds that caused the ship to capsize are calculated. (cont.) Furthermore, a cost analysis associated with the total loss of the ship due to capsize is also reviewed. An existing worldwide database of vessel total losses, dating from 1960 to present, is used to calculate the costs per ship capsize. Some simplifications are inevitably used, because the cost implications of total ship losses have both direct and indirect portions that are difficult to quantify. In addition, the actual numbers that result from such a catastrophe are not generally available to the public and are not found in the open literature. Given these limitations, a preliminary analysis of the capsize-associated costs is performed for several types of commercial vessels. by Angelos Antonopoulos. Thesis (Nav. E. and S.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} reported in this thesis was to improve the understanding of footwear and soft ground interaction and, in particular, its mathematical modelling. The work was undertaken for the Military Footwear Section of the MOD's Defence Clothing and Textiles Agency (DCTA) who funded {{the research}} in conjunction with the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSERC). Although research has been carried out on the interaction of footwear on firm surfaces, minimal work has previously been carried out on softer surfaces often encountered in combat situations and little effort has been applied to its mathematical modelling. The research programme included the development of mathematical models using soil mechanics theory, and experimental work using a soft-ground slip-rig. The prototype soft-ground footwear slip-rig that has been developed is a manually operated device based on simple mechanical mechanisms using weights and pulleys. The rig enables the measurement of traction and sinkage for different soil types, sole materials and tread geometry, at various <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>heel</b> contact and applied vertical load. All experimental work has been carried out with the use of scaled up cleats to obtain measurable results. An investigation into three dimensional end effects has determined at what cleat length the problem becomes two dimensional. The experimental results have shown the effects of cleat geometry on total cleat traction for sand, and in particular the geometric characteristics that promote and reduce traction. These results have been analysed using Taguchi's Analysis of Variance technique. Traction distribution experiments have determined the proportion of traction obtained from different cleat areas. Soil mechanics theory, and in particular Coulomb's retaining wall theory, has been applied in the theoretical modelling of footwear and soft ground interaction. A two dimensional total traction model has been developed using MATLAB software and experimental and theoretical results have been compared. The traction versus cleat geometry trends for both the experimental and theoretical results were in good agreement...|$|R

Background: Currently the majority of orthopedic workshops, sports- and running stores supply individually designed insoles to support and/or correct biomechanical structures in the lower extremity. A dynamic analysis will most commonly be performed of the patient on a treadmill. Subsequently the insoles will be fabricated after the patients demand. One problem that can occur when the running analysis is performed is that the patient is in a physically well rested condition. When the patient gets exhausted over time, the running technique is impaired and the strain on the lower extremity increases. Participants: Eight male subjects. Method: The eversion angle was compared before and after an exhausting running procedure on the treadmill. Result: The eversion angle tends to increase in relation to exhaustion, however not significant (p> 0. 05). Conclusion: No significant difference in eversion angle was noted in this study, however the eversion angle tends to increase in relation to exhaustion.
