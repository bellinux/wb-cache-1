5|$|The {{first few}} (1–3 in Ayt Ayache and Ayt Ndhir) {{cardinal}} numerals have native Berber and borrowed Arabic forms. All higher cardinals are borrowed from Arabic, {{consistent with the}} linguistic universals that the numbers 1–3 <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be retained, and that a borrowed number generally implies that numbers greater than it are also borrowed. The retention of one is also motivated {{by the fact that}} Berber languages near-universally use unity as a determiner.|$|E
5|$|The use of interferon, which {{requires}} injections daily or thrice weekly, has been supplanted by long-acting PEGylated interferon, which is injected only once weekly. However, some individuals <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to respond than others, and {{this might be}} because of the genotype of the infecting virus or the person's heredity. The treatment reduces viral replication in the liver, thereby reducing the viral load (the amount of virus particles as measured in the blood). Response to treatment differs between the genotypes. Interferon treatment may produce an e antigen seroconversion rate of 37% in genotype A but only a 6% seroconversion in type D. Genotype B has similar seroconversion rates to type A while type C seroconverts only in 15% of cases. Sustained e antigen loss after treatment is ~45% in types A and B but only 25–30% in types C and D.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} a number of aquatic {{activities}} to enjoy on Malta as well as Gozo and Comino. Northern Malta {{is home to the}} country's beach resorts and holiday areas, with the beaches most popular with holiday-makers being Mellieha Bay, Ghajn Tuffieha and Golden Bay. These beaches are large {{enough to be able to}} house cafes, restaurants and kiosks, but small enough to be crowded rarely. Malta's northwest is home to the island's quietest beaches, and it is on these that the main island's neighbouring two are nearest. Gozo and Comino are also popular beach spots for holiday-makers, although these <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be quieter, rockier and more suitable for snorkelling. The Mediterranean Sea surrounding Malta is popular for diving - while shallow dips may be attractive to beginning divers, more experienced divers may be able to dive deeper to find historical artifacts from World War II or earlier.|$|E
5|$|True Thescelosaurus remains {{are known}} {{definitely}} only from late Maastrichtian-age rocks, from Alberta (Scollard Formation) and Saskatchewan (Frenchman Formation), Canada, and Wyoming (Lance Formation), South Dakota (Hell Creek Formation), Montana (Hell Creek), and Colorado (Laramie Formation), USA. With {{the exception of}} birds, {{it was one of}} the last genera of dinosaurs, its remains being found as close as 3meters to the boundary clay containing the iridium layer that closes the Cretaceous. There are reports of teeth from older, Campanian-age rocks, particularly from the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, but these specimens are not from Thescelosaurus and <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> those of Orodromeus. More specimens are known than have been officially described for this genus, such as the Triebold specimen, which has been the source of several skeletal casts for museums.|$|E
