40|$|The {{perceived}} {{atmosphere in}} a space is {{to a large extent}} determined by the illumination of the space, which usually is a combination of artificial lighting and daylight naturally entering the room. In this study we investigated how the presence of daylight affects the perceived atmosphere of a light ambience both in a real illuminated space and in a visualization of the space. The perceptual accuracy of these visualizations has been demonstrated in previous studies for <b>artificial</b> <b>interior</b> <b>lighting,</b> but not yet for the contribution of daylight to the interior lighting. Our results showed only a relatively small effect of the contribution of daylight both on the perception of light and the perception of the atmosphere of an interior light ambience. Possibly, adaptation {{plays an important role in}} this finding. Further, we demonstrated that the perceptual accuracy of visualizations containing daylight was for the majority of the light and atmosphere perception attributes similar to visualizations showing only <b>artificial</b> <b>interior</b> <b>lighting.</b> © (2015) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

40|$|Summary A {{variety of}} methods have been {{developed}} for field measurement of working plane illuminance from <b>interior</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>lighting.</b> The methods recommended by the various national lighting bodies are generally similar to, or derivatives of, the methods set out in the CIBSE Code for <b>Interior</b> <b>Lighting,</b> IES Lighting Handbook or DIN Standard. All the methods require measurement of illuminance at points on a grid at working-plane height, but the grid size and position of the measuring points differ. The IES method, and its derivatives, position the grid relative to the luminaire locations; the CIBSE and DIN methods use a grid which is a function of room size. The techniques of analysis of the field measurement results also differ. This paper reports the results of a series of comparative field measurements taken in typical installations according to the recommendations of the various lighting codes. Modifications to the CIBSE method are suggested. ...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of light}} as a primary agent in sensory {{perception}} {{of the physical world}} has been a subject of inquiry and debate since antiquity. These discussions frequently have centered on the mechanisms of sight and the physiological processes of perception—how the eye ‘sees’, how perception occurs, and where the process of visual perception takes place. In philosophy, science, art, and religion light has been bound to vision in the discourse of sense perception across a variety of visual phenomena. With the co-development of modernity and ever more powerful forms of artificial illumination, increasing attention has been given to the capacity of light to guide, shape, and reconfigure the visual environment. Particularly in terms of modern architecture and <b>interiors,</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>light</b> has been held up as an unprecedented and unparalleled new medium of form-giving and perception-making...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} growing {{interest}} in vehicle <b>interior</b> <b>lighting</b> for both functional and esthetic purposes. Although {{a large body of}} research has developed over many years on nighttime driver vision and vehicle exterior lighting, there has traditionally been little research attention to <b>interior</b> <b>lighting.</b> This report includes a brief review of some of the research that has been done, and presents the results of a nighttime field study that was performed to contribute to the understanding of how vehicle <b>interior</b> <b>lighting</b> affects some basic aspects of driver vision. Participants in the study were asked to perform two tasks while seated in a stationary experimental car on a closed test road at night: (1) detecting pedestrians on the road ahead, and (2) rating the subjective brightness of a reflected veiling light on the windshield. The veiling light was varied in both luminance and color. The results indicated that pedestrian detection was closely related to photopic photometric measures, suggesting the pedestrian task was influenced primarily by cone photoreceptors, while the rating of subjective brightness appeared to show an influence of rod photoreceptors. These results have implications for how the photometry of vehicle <b>interior</b> <b>lighting</b> should be performed in order to give the best correlation with driver visual performance. Future research should further quantify the effects observed here and investigate changes in retinal adaptation associated with automotive <b>interior</b> <b>lighting...</b>|$|R
