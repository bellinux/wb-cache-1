The organization supports women wishing to leave the industry, but does not try to persuade them to do so. The group does not focus upon conversion but rather on communicating its message that Christians exist who are not judging female sex workers and <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> them. The organization also helps {{both women and men}} seeking to overcome pornography addiction.|$|E

They are generally inexpensive, particularly for in-state residents, and are focused on teaching, and accept most applicants meeting minimum grade and SAT score levels. Students commute to school and rarely live in dorms on campus. These schools often have articulation arrangements with four-year state public schools to permit students to transfer. Consultants suggest that community colleges are reasonably priced, and after two years with solid grades and academic performance, many colleges <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> transfers.|$|E

500|$|Soon after {{returning}} to England, Phips joined back up with Increase Mather and again supported him in dealing with Whitehall. Increase Mather's diary says they are together on March 25, 1691, and again on March 26. On March 31, they are together as Increase Mather writes {{a response to the}} Board of Trade. Also at this meeting is Sir Henry Ashurst. These three—Mather the clergyman, flanked by two knights: Sir Phips & Sir Ashurst—would emerge later as the major proponents of the various compromises that brought about a new charter. Not counting Phips, there seem to have been a total of four agents acting on behalf of Massachusetts in seeking to restore the old charter. The two agents holding official commission papers from the Massachusetts council—Cooke and Oakes—were also the least compromising and the least politically deft. The Board of Trade seems to have sought a policy of pushing through a new charter by cleaving the two knights away from these two agents. July 24, Increase Mather records in his diary that he would [...] "part with my life sooner than [...] ". Not long after this Increase Mather left London on vacation. August 11, 1691, a letter was written from Whitehall to the King William's secretary: [...] "I must now desire your Lordship to acquaint the King that they <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> their Charter... and no longer Insist upon the Alterations mentioned..." [...] This could not have been Cooke and Oakes, as they never wavered in their stance opposing a new charter. Mather's diary entry one week later (August 19) indicates that he is still either unaware or has not yet accepted this move. On August 20, the Earl of Nottingham told a committee that he had been with Sir William Phips who informed him that the New England agents [...] "did acquiesce therein [...]" [...] By August 27, Increase Mather had decided to participate in the process of shaping this new charter, if reluctantly.|$|E

[...] He would wait here, not eating any foods or eating any liquids during this time, usually lasting up to 4 days. [...] While this occurred, the girl's family would take no notice of him.

2500|$|The {{historical}} {{accuracy of}} Livy's account is disputed among modern historians. [...] They <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> that while Livy might have simplified {{the way in}} which the Sidicini, Campani and Samnites came to be at war, his narrative is here, at least in outline, historical. [...] The Sidicini's stronghold at Teanum controlled an important regional crossroads, which would have provided the Samnites with a motive for conquest. [...] The First Samnite War might have started quite by accident, as Livy claimed. [...] The Sidicini were located on the Samnite river side of the Liris, and while the Roman-Samnite treaty might only have dealt with the middle Liris, not the lower, Rome does not appear to have been overly concerned for the fate of the Sidicini. The Samnites could therefore go to war with Sidicini without fear of Roman involvement. It was only the unforeseen involvement of the Campani that brought in the Romans.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the final}} mention of Elijah in the Hebrew Bible {{is in the}} Book of Chronicles, the Christian Bible's {{ordering}} of the books of the Septuagint places the Book of Malachi, which prophesies a messiah, before the Gospels [...] and means that Elijah's final Old Testament appearance is in the Book of Malachi, where it is written, [...] "Lo, I will send you the prophet Elijah before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes." [...] That day is described as the burning of a great furnace, [...] "... {{so that it will}} leave them neither root nor branch." [...] In Christianity it is traditionally believed that Elijah's appearance during the transfiguration of Jesus fulfilled this prophecy. Moreover, in the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus identifies John the Baptist as the spiritual successor to Elijah: [...] "and if you <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> it, he is Elijah who is to come." [...] Finally, the verses in Malachi are believed to indicate that Elijah has a role in the end-times, immediately before the second coming of Jesus.|$|E
2500|$|Liberal {{historian}} Eric Alterman {{notes that}} barely 20% of Americans <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> [...] "liberal" [...] {{as a political}} label, but that supermajorities of Americans actually favor [...] "liberal" [...] positions time and again. Alterman points out that resistance to the label [...] "liberal" [...] is not surprising due to billions {{of dollars worth of}} investment poured into the denigration of the term. A 2004 poll conducted by the National Election Study found only 35% of respondents questioned identifying as liberal compared to 55% identifying as conservative; a 2004 Pew poll found 19% of respondents identifying as liberal, and 39% identifying as conservative, with the balance identifying as moderate. A 2006 poll found that 19% identified as liberal, and 36% conservative. In 2005, self-identifying moderates polled by Louis Harris & Associates were found to share essentially the same political beliefs as self-identifying liberals, but rejected the world [...] "liberal" [...] because of the vilification heaped on the word itself by conservatives. Alterman acknowledges political scientist Drew Westen's observation that for most Americans, the word [...] "liberal" [...] now carries meanings such as [...] "elite", [...] "tax and spend", and [...] "out of touch".|$|E
2500|$|In Hunters of Dune, the 2006 {{continuation}} of the series by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, Murbella adopts the new title of Mother Commander and struggles to bring the opposing factions of her New Sisterhood together. Among the Bene Gesserit, some <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the merger with the Honored Matres, while others oppose allying with their enemies; a group of dissenters led by Reverend Mother Sheeana had previously fled Chapterhouse aboard a no-ship upon Murbella's ascension to leadership. Within the Honored Matres, many admire Murbella's strength and abilities and desire Bene Gesserit training, but resist assimilation. Additionally, a number of Honored Matres refuse to acknowledge Murbella as their leader; the largest such rebel group is led by Matre Superior Hellica on Tleilax. As Murbella amasses weaponry for the coming battle with the unknown enemy, she trains an elite force of commando troops with the combined battle talents of Bene Gesserit, Honored Matres, and even the Swordmasters of Ginaz. These [...] "Valkyries" [...] are able to effect Hellica's defeat, galvanizing many dissenters into finally joining Murbella's cause against the unknown enemy, now revealed to be the resurrected thinking machines thought destroyed 15,000 years before. In the 2007 sequel, Sandworms of Dune, the thinking machines have unleashed decimating viruses on planet after planet, while Face Dancers infiltrate human civilization in their own insidious plot {{to take over the}} universe. The New Sisterhood's fleet of warships succumbs to Face Dancer sabotage, but is saved from thinking machine attack by a host of Guild Navigators in heighliners, brought together by the Oracle of Time, Norma Cenva. Thinking machine leader Omnius is wiped out of existence by the Oracle, and the Face Dancer threat eliminated. As Murbella joins Duncan Idaho in his plan to rule a universe in which humanity and thinking machines co-exist, Sheeana introduces sandworms to the former thinking machine planet Synchrony, where she will found an orthodox Sisterhood.|$|E
