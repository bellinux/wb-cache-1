40|$|The {{application}} {{of the theory of}} the synthesis of offset dual-shaped reflectors to the design of compact ranges is examined. The object of the compact range is to provide a uniform plane wave with minimum amplitude and phase ripple over as large a volume as possible for a given size reflector. Ripple can be lowered by reducing the edge diffraction from the reflector producing the plane wave. This has been done either by serrating or rolling the edge. An alternative approach is to use dual offset-shaped reflector synthesis techniques to produce a reflector aperture distribution that is uniform over most of the aperture, but with a Gaussian taper near the edge.

For the REBO potential, at 300  K, the maximum and initial elasticity are reduced by 7.4 and 9.6  %, respectively. As the temperature increases, the softening increases almost linearly and at 2000  K, elasticity softening reaches 16.5 and 35.3  % for the maximum and initial elasticity, respectively. For the Tersoff potential, the maximum elasticity softening almost agrees with the REBO potential. However, the initial elasticity reduction is smaller and similar to the maximum elasticity softening at low temperature due to the smaller <b>ripple</b> <b>amplitudes.</b> The <b>ripple</b> <b>amplitude</b> at 300  K is reported as 0.6  Å [13], which is between the REBO (0.7  Å) and Tersoff potential (0.5  Å).

40|$|Radio {{frequency}} {{power amplifiers}} (PAs) {{are the most}} challenging part of the design of radio systems since they dictate the overall system's performance in terms of power efficiency and distortion generation. The performance is further challenged by modern modulation schemes which are characterized by highly varying signal envelopes. In {{order to meet the}} spectrum mask requirements, PAs are usually operated at high power back-off to ensure linearity, at the cost of efficiency. To tackle this issue, many efficiency enhancement techniques have been presented in the literature. In fact, these techniques do increase the PA power efficiency at back-off, however, efficiency enhancement techniques do not ensure the linearity of the PA. Furthermore, these techniques may lead to additional distortion. On the other hand, several linearization techniques have been developed to mitigate the PA nonlinearity problem and allow the PA to operate at less back-off. Digital Pre-Distortion (DPD) technique is gaining more attention, as compared to other linearization techniques, thanks to its simple concept and advancements in digital signal processors (DSP) and signal converters. DPD technique consists of introducing a nonlinear function before the PA so that the overall cascaded system behaves linearly. It was clear from the literature that this technique showed good performance. Yet, it has primarily been validated using commercial test equipment, which has good capabilities, and far from the real world environment in which this technique would be implemented. Indeed, DPDs would need to be implemented in signal processors characterised by limited resources and computational accuracy. This thesis presents an implementation of several DPD models, namely look-up table (LUT), memoryless polynomial and memory polynomial (MP), on a field programmable gate array (FPGA). A novel model reformulation made this implementation possible in fixed-point arithmetic. Measurements were collected to validate the DPD models' implementation and an improvement of the signal quality was recorded in terms of error vector magnitude (EVM) and adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR). As many wireless access technologies must continue to coexist, multi-standard radio systems are required to reduce the cost while maintaining the interoperability. This thesis presents a development platform for multimode radio which comprises mixed-signal modules. The platform provides the capacity for hardware and software development. In fact, the FPGA under investigation allowed for the implementation of a baseband transceiver and DPD schemes.

We investigated coupling between epileptiform spike phase and <b>ripple</b> <b>amplitude</b> to better understand the mechanisms that generate this type of pathologic ripple (pRipple) event. Methods: We quantified phase amplitude coupling (PAC) between epileptiform electroencephalography (EEG) spike phase and <b>ripple</b> <b>amplitude</b> recorded from intracranial depth macroelectrodes during episodes of sleep in 12 patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. PAC was determined by (1) a phasor transform that corresponds to the strength and rate of ripples coupled with spikes, and a (2) ripple-triggered average to measure the strength, morphology, and spectral frequency of the modulating and modulated signals. Coupling strength was evaluated in relation to recording sites within and outside the seizure-onset zone (SOZ). Results: Both the phasor transform and ripple-triggered averaging methods showed that <b>ripple</b> <b>amplitude</b> was often robustly coupled with epileptiform EEG spike phase. Coupling was found more regularly inside than outside the SOZ, and coupling strength correlated with the likelihood a macroelectrode's location was within the SOZ (p < 0. 01).

30|$|The {{influence}} of TIF diameter and path spacing on the ripples {{is similar to}} the previous research results [13]. The following analysis focuses on the {{influence of}} path type on the RMSr. Figure  13 shows the contours of residual ripples with three paths, i.e., raster path, circle path, random path, with keeping other process parameters consistent. Figure  14 is the curves of residual ripples with three paths. It can be seen from Fig.  14 that the <b>ripple</b> <b>amplitude</b> of raster path is minimal, and the <b>ripple</b> <b>amplitude</b> of circle path is slightly larger than that of raster path, and the <b>ripple</b> <b>amplitude</b> of random path is maximal. According to the characters of three paths, it shows that the ripple feature is related to the turn angle on the path. When the angle between the dwell points on the path is less than 180 °, the extra removal exhibits on the corner. Theoretically, the turn angle on the raster path is 180 °, and the turn angle between the dwell points on the circle path is related to the radius of circle. The smaller the radius is, the more extra removal is, so the residual ripple of circle path is slightly larger than the raster path, and is prone to produce “center error” at the center of circle path. Since the turn angle is generally large (more than 90 °), the extra removal produced by the circle path is not significant. There are three angles, such as 60 °, 120 °, and 180 ° between the dwell points on the random path. Comparing the removal depth at the corner with different angles, the removal depth with corner angle 60 ° is the maximal, and the removal depth with corner angle 180 ° is the minimal, as shown in Fig.  15. Since the RMSr {{is directly related to the}} <b>amplitude</b> of <b>ripple,</b> the raster path produces the minimum ripple, while the random path produces the maximum ripple.|$|R

The length of the C–C bonds is calculated to investigate whether the C–C bond stretching begins after the ripples flatten or {{at the same time}} with the reduction in the <b>ripple</b> <b>amplitude.</b> There are two types of the C–C bonds that are parallel and oblique to the applied loading direction as shown in Fig.  1. Twenty C–C bonds are randomly selected for each type, and their lengths are averaged. The standard deviation of the C–C bonds length for 20 samples is calculated as 0.0002, showing a uniform variation. As shown in Fig.  5 b, the C–C bonds are stretched as soon as stretching is applied. However, as seen in the feature of the second derivatives of the C–C bond stretching in Fig.  3 c, the bond stretching is nonlinear initially and turns to linear, indicating that ripples affect bond stretching at the initial stage of loading. The initial average <b>ripple</b> <b>amplitude</b> is less than 1  Å, which is comparable to the bonding length. Thus, the uniaxial loading affects simultaneously both the reduction in the <b>ripple</b> <b>amplitude</b> and the increase of the length of C–C bonds, although the effect of bond stretching is not considerably large at the initial stage.|$|R

When a graphene membrane {{is placed on}} a solid substrate, the adhesive interactions between graphene and the substrate could considerably suppress thermal rippling.

The <b>rippling</b> <b>amplitude,</b> the equilibrium average separation, and the average interaction energy are predicted simultaneously and compared with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
