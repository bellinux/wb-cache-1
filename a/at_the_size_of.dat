25|$|Magnates of the Commonwealth {{are often}} called the {{aristocracy}} of the Commonwealth but the definition of what constitutes aristocracy differs {{from the rest of}} Europe in that the Magnate families were much more powerful, often comparable to Princes. A good example is the extinct family of Pac that ruled the Duchy of Lithuania in the 17th century. The Pac family had not descended from a Prince, and therefore did not use any title at all. During the partition of the Commonwealth the Pac family received the title of Count. However, when looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the Pac properties and their position in the Commonwealth, a simple Count title seems not adequate to their power and property size that was far beyond imagination of most of the European Lords.|$|E
25|$|Mansa Mahmud IV {{tried to}} take {{advantage}} of the situation with the support of Fulbe and Bambara chiefs. In 1599, the mansa led this army in a march on Battle of Jenné. The rulers of Jenné called on the Moroccan garrison of Arma in Timbuktu for reinforcements. The other obstacle to the mansa's success was his betrayal by a major ally prior to the battle. The reasoning behind this betrayal, according to Mandinka oral traditions was that Mahmud IV did not have the support of Mali's traditional generals, the Farim-Soura and Sankar-Zouma. This major ally of the mansa abandoned him at the last moment and went over to the Moroccans and advised them on what to expect from the mansa's army. Despite their amazement <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the mansa's force, the Arma won the battle after a violent bombardment.|$|E

500|$|In 1786, the Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor {{was formed}} by {{citizens}} concerned <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> London's indigent Black population, {{many of whom had}} been expelled from North America as Black Loyalists — former slaves who had fought {{on the side of the}} British in the War of Independence. Others were discharged sailors and some a legacy of British involvement in the slave trade. The committee distributed food, clothing, medical aid and found work for men, from various locations including the White Raven tavern in Mile End. They also helped the men to go abroad, some to Canada. In October 1786, the Committee funded an ill-fated expedition of 280 black men, 40 black women and 70 white women (mainly wives and girlfriends) to settle in Sierra Leone. [...] From the late 19th century, a large African mariner community was established in Canning Town as a result of new shipping links to the Caribbean and West Africa.|$|E
500|$|The blotchy swellshark is oviparous, and {{reproduction}} proceeds {{throughout the year}} with no obvious seasonal cycling. Adult females have a single functional ovary, on the right, and two functional oviducts. The species {{is thought to be}} relatively prolific, as the ovary contains numerous ova at various stages of development. Pairs of eggs are laid at a time, one per oviduct. Females have been documented producing eggs even after years without male contact, suggesting that {{they may be able to}} store sperm. The purse-shaped egg capsules are relatively large and thick, measuring around [...] long and [...] across. The capsule surface is smooth with lengthwise striations, and opaque cream in color with yellow margins. Long, coiled tendrils extend from the four corners of the capsule. When the embryo is [...] long, the external gills have been lost, the dermal denticles have begun to develop, and light brown saddles are present. The eggs take roughly one year to hatch; newly emerged sharks measure [...] long. From a series of captive rearing experiments, Sho Tanaka reported that hatchling sharks grew in length by up to [...] per day. Males and females attain sexual maturity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> [...] and [...] respectively; the growth rate after maturity is very low.

2500|$|The biggest {{demonstration}} of the global day of protest took place in Italy in Rome. Nearly 3,000 buses and thirty trains were specially chartered to bring people to the demonstration, which was organised under the slogan [...] "Stop the war; no ifs or buts". The organisers were shocked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the turn out and the unexpected number of people forced the demonstration to set off two hours early. 650,000 people (police estimate) {{took place in a}} final rally at which there were many international speakers including Kurds, Iraqi dissidents, Palestinians, a representative of the American Council of Christian Churches and an Israeli conscientious objector who addressed the crowd from a stage hung with Pablo Picasso's Guernica. The size of the demonstration meant that the majority of demonstrators did not make it into the final rally and in total three million people (organisers' estimate, supported by the Guinness Book of World Records) were on the streets. This was listed in the 2004 Guinness Book of World Records as the largest anti-war rally in history. According to the Green Left Weekly (GLW), the demonstration contained people from across Italian society; [...] "Catholic nuns and priests marched alongside young people with dreadlocks, nose rings and Palestinian scarves. Christians, anarchists and communists mingled".|$|E
