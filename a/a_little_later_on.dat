25|$|The Pocket was not cleared until 21 June 1945, however, as {{the rest}} of Labuan had been cleared, it was decided to gain control of the high ground on {{the eastern side of the}} {{mainland}} of Borneo in order to gain control of the beaches so that they could be used later to land supplies for use during the subsequent advance to the north. On 17 June, the 2/32nd Battalion crossed Brunei Bay on board a number of landing craft and landed at Weston. They were followed shortly afterward by the rest of the 24th Brigade, which began moving inland towards Beaufort. The 2/11th Commando Squadron followed <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>later</b> <b>on</b> 19 June, landing at Mempakul.|$|E
25|$|In England, the {{squadron}} went through an intensive training {{program with the}} Royal Air Force. On 17 October 1942, it was assigned Spitfire PR Mk XIs, and late in January 1943, it received its first A-20 Havoc. During those months {{the squadron}} participated in several maneuvers and became a very efficient organization. On 8 July, the unit was re-designated the 12th Reconnaissance Squadron (Fighter). <b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>later,</b> <b>on</b> 13 July, a reorganization took place and the A-20s, gunners, liaison pilots, {{and most of the}} observers of the squadron were transferred to the 153rd Liaison Squadron. The 12th was then equipped with P-51 Mustangs and F-6 Reconnaissance Mustangs. Late in October, the 12th Squadron was transferred from the VIII Air Support Command to the IX Fighter Command. The unit became highly mobile and proficient at changing airfields on short notice. It would fly from eight English bases before moving to the Continent.|$|E
500|$|All Hope Is Gone was {{generally}} well received by critics. Several music critics anticipated the album {{immediately after the}} release of Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses). In its review of Vol. 3, Allmusic stated, [...] "There's a sense that whatever Slipknot do next might be their ultimate broadcast to the faithful." [...] Copies of All Hope Is Gone intended for reviewers were pressed under the false name [...] "Rusty Cage" [...] {{to reduce the risk of}} the album leaking onto the Internet. Stephen Erlewine wrote in his review for Allmusic that the early [...] "cluster of cacophony" [...] of [...] "Gematria" [...] is [...] "so effective [...] that when things do get a little softer <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>later</b> <b>on,</b> the album threatens to collapse like a soufflé" [...] and opined that [...] "one more power ballad like Snuff would be enough to derail the album.". He gave the album a rating of four out of five stars. Regarding the album's creation process, Darren Sadler of Rock Sound wrote, [...] "Slipknot raised their collective middle fingers, and created an album that stands out head and shoulders above everything else that will be released this year." [...] He compared the album's sound to those of other bands such as Stone Sour, Morbid Angel, and Meshuggah, and he gave the album a score of 9 out of 10. Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth.net gave All Hope Is Gone 7.5 out of 10 stars. Ogle stated that the fans' views of the [...] "diversity" [...] of the album would be Slipknot's [...] "saving grace, or their misfortune", concluding, [...] "While it may not be as jaw-dropping or revolutionary as some might have hoped, it's by no means a bad release." [...] Reviewing for Blender, writer Darren Ratner observed a different theme in the lyrics when compared to previous Slipknot albums, noting that the band is able to [...] "make ugliness sound just a little bit pretty". Marc Weingarten of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+ rating, calling All Hope Is Gone [...] "a metal assault-and-battery on the hypocrisies of the modern world". Jim Kaz of IGN stated that the band's attempt to move from nu-metal to [...] "more classic metal elements" [...] was [...] "the best career move they could've made". Kaz gave All Hope Is Gone a score of 8.1 out of 10, writing, [...] " [...] effectively [...] upon the band's collective strengths." [...] Q noted that the band no longer resembled [...] "a threat to Western civilisation" [...] but claimed that the album delivered one shock; [...] "how listenable they've become", including [...] "Snuff" [...] in the top 50 downloads for August 2008.|$|E
