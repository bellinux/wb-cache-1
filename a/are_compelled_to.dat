5|$|A {{narrative}} pattern follows, whereby Cet {{demands a}} challenge, an Ulster warrior rises, and the Ulaid cry out {{the name of}} the challenger; Cet then proceeds to shame that warrior by recounting one of his deeds against him, as above. Cet shames the challenger Óengus son of Lam Gabuid, by recounting how he had cut off Lam Gabuid's hands in battle; he shames Éogan son of Durthacht, the king of Fermag, by recounting how he put out his eye in a cattle-raid; he reminds Muinremur son of Gerrgend how he had taken his son's head as a trophy not six days earlier; Mend son of Salchad, how he had cut off his father's foot; Celtchair son of Uthecar, how he had castrated him with his spear; and even Conchobar's son Cúscraid Mend Machae, how he had pierced his neck with a spear during Cúscraid's first feat of arms, in ignominious circumstances which led to the abandonment a third of Cúscraid's retinue in a cowardly retreat. In each case, the challenging warriors <b>are</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> retake their seats in shame.|$|E

25|$|Still, dwellers in {{the complex}} are not {{prohibited}} from leaving the camp or using services and facilities outside it. Throngs of school-going Nepalese children regularly leave and enter the camp everyday, wearing the uniforms of national schools. The camp's close proximity to Bartley Secondary School has seen {{a significant number of}} Nepalese children being enrolled there, although they can also be found in schools much further away as the children become gradually assimilated into Singaporean society and culture. They cannot sink their roots deeply, however, as most of them are in the country on dependent passes, and <b>are</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> leave Singapore when they turn 21.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, Steller {{sea lions}} {{have been known}} to enter the Columbia River estuary and feed on white sturgeon, several salmon species and rainbow trout, some of which are also listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. They enter the Columbia River {{primarily}} in the late winter and spring, occasionally going as far upstream as Bonneville Dam. Though not as abundant as the California sea lion, they are still a concern for those agencies charged with managing the fish populations. Since the Steller sea lions are themselves protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, managers <b>are</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> use nonlethal deterrence methods, such as rubber bullets and noisemakers. Deterrence by the public is strictly forbidden.|$|E
25|$|A United Nations Special Rapporteur {{undertook}} {{a mission to}} Mexico in 2002 to investigate reports by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights that the country's judiciary and administration of law was not independent. During {{the course of his}} visit to a number of cities, the rapporteur observed that corruption in the judiciary had not been reduced significantly. One of the principal issues is that, because the federal courts operate at a relatively high level, most citizens <b>are</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> seek justice in the inadequate state courts. Additionally, the rapporteur expressed concerns about such issues as disorganization in the legal profession, difficulties and harassment faced by lawyers, poor trial procedures, poor access to the justice system for indigenous peoples and minors, and lacklustre investigation of many crimes.|$|E
25|$|The {{inhabitants}} of Oceania, particularly the Outer Party members, {{have no real}} privacy. Many of them live in apartments equipped with two-way telescreens {{so that they may}} be watched or listened to at any time. Similar telescreens are found at workstations and in public places, along with hidden microphones. Written correspondence is routinely opened and read by the government before it is delivered. The Thought Police employ undercover agents, who pose as normal citizens and report any person with subversive tendencies. Children are encouraged to report suspicious persons to the government, and some denounce their parents. Citizens are controlled, and the smallest sign of rebellion, even something so small as a facial expression, can result in immediate arrest and imprisonment. Thus, citizens, particularly party members, <b>are</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> obedience.|$|E

25|$|The socialist view of {{economic}} freedom conceives of freedom as a concrete situation {{as opposed to}} an abstract or moral concept. This view of freedom is closely related to the socialist view of human creativity and the importance ascribed to creative freedom. Socialists view creativity as an essential aspect of human nature, thus defining freedom as a situation or state of being where individuals are able to express their creativity unhindered by constraints of both material scarcity and coercive social institutions. Marxists stress the importance of freeing the individual from what they view as coercive, exploitative and alienating social relationships of production they <b>are</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> partake in, as well as the importance {{of economic}} development as providing the material basis for the existence of a state of society where there are enough resources to allow for each individual to pursue his or her genuine creative interests.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} ghost towns or {{abandoned}} {{communities in the}} American Great Plains, the rural areas of which have lost {{a third of their}} population since 1920. Thousands of communities in the northern plains states of Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota became railroad ghost towns when a rail line failed to materialize. Hundreds more towns were abandoned when the US Highway System replaced the railroads as the favored mode of travel. Ghost towns are common in mining or mill towns in all the western states, and many eastern and southern states as well. Residents <b>are</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> leave in search of more productive areas when the resources that had created an employment boom in these towns were eventually consumed. Some unincorporated towns become ghost towns due to flooding caused by dam projects that created manmade lakes, such as Oketeyeconne. Ghost towns are particularly numerous in the southwestern state of New Mexico.|$|E
