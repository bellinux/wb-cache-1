40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Psychological {{comorbidity}} is a known {{aspect of}} allergic disease. However, there is recent {{evidence that a}} large proportion of allergic patients remains undiagnosed and untreated for psychological disease. In addition, the complexities of the anxiety-allergy relationship, i. e. differences for current and past disease, or differences among allergic disease types, are not well understood. OBJECTIVES: To measure the level of anxiety in a large allergic population in France using a standardized measure, the State/Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). METHODS: Allergy patients in France (n = 3939) who visited their allergy specialists participated in the study. The patients completed a questionnaire which was then linked to the questionnaire completed by their physician. Only patients with both subject and physician questionnaire were kept in the analyses. Mean STAI scores for the State (S) and Trait (T) scales were obtained for each allergic disease. ANCOVA models testing group differences on the mean scores, using the categories "current disease", "past disease" and "allergic disease ever", were assessed along with relevant confounders. RESULTS: Allergic rhinitis (AR), asthma and atopic dermatitis (AD) were the most prevalent conditions of the 12 allergic diseases assessed in the study. Women had higher mean STAI S/T scores than men and age was also found to be associated with higher S scores; therefore, both age and gender were included as covariates where relevant. A single ANCOVA model for each STAI scale showed a statistical difference among the various allergic diseases. Using the category "current disease" each allergic disease was assessed separately regarding {{the presence or absence of}} that disease. Higher, statistically significant mean STAI scores were found for AD and <b>allergic</b> <b>urticaria</b> on the S scale and for AD on the T scale. Similarly, for the category "allergic disease ever", AD and <b>allergic</b> <b>urticaria</b> reached statistical significance on the S scale, while on the T scale only AD was statistically significant. When patients were assessed for anxiety based on their past disease, asthma, AR and sinusitis were significant on the S scale while asthma and nasal polyps were statistically significant on the T scale. When asthma and AD were tested simultaneously, only the latter was significant. CONCLUSIONS: High mean scores for State and Trait anxiety were mostly associated with AD...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTSeveral {{guidelines}} for urticaria and angioedema {{have been published}} in Europe and United States since 1997. General principles for diagnosis and treatments of them are similar. However, each guideline has its own characteristics and shows differences in areas such as the coverage of urticaria subtypes, nomenclatures, and hierarchy of the medications. In Japan, the Japanese Dermatological Association (JDA) published its first guideline for urticaria and angioedema in 2005. It established a new classification of urticaria and angioedema together with the definition of each subtype. It emphasized the importance of discriminating idiopathic urticaria, consisting of acute urticaria and chronic urticaria from inducible urticaria, such as <b>allergic</b> <b>urticaria,</b> physical urticaria and cholinergic urticaria. It contains several unique algorithms for diagnosis and treatment of urticaria from a view point of clinical practices, and was further enforced by a style of EBM in 2011. Nevertheless, these guidelines have not been recognized outside of Japan, because of a language barrier. In this article, the outline of the newest guidelines by JDA are introduced and compared with the guidelines in other countries published in English...|$|E

40|$|While {{it is well}} {{established}} that acute <b>allergic</b> <b>urticaria</b> is caused by degranulation of skin mast cells occurring after allergen/IgE-dependent cross-linking of high affinity IgE receptors (FcepsilonRI), the pathophysiologic mechanisms operative in chronic urticaria (CU) are less well understood. Some evidence points {{to the existence of}} histamine-releasing activity in the serum of CU patients which possibly acts via triggering of FcepsilonRI. In this study, we aimed to better characterize this anti-FcepsilonRIalpha reactivity of CU patients using affinity-purified, IgE-depleted IgG fractions of such individuals (CU-IgG). Using immobilized, recombinant soluble FcepsilonRIalpha as a a reaction target for Western blot studies, we found that 12 / 32 (37 %) CU-IgG serum samples exhibited IgG autoreactivity against FcepsilonRI- alpha. These findings were confirmed by experiments demonstrating that immunoblot-reactive, but not immunoblot-nonreactive, CU-IgG preparations precipitated the FcepsilonRIalpha from FcepsilonRI- alphagamma-transfected cells. No anti-FcepsilonRIalpha reactivity was observed in IgG fractions from atopic dermatitis (AD) patients (0 / 15) or healthy control individuals (CO: 0 / 15). As opposed to the selective occurrence of IgG anti-Fc epsilon RI alpha autoantibodies in CU patients, IgG anti-IgE antibodies were detected in all groups investigated (CU: 69 %; AD: 73 %; CO: 26 %). While both types of autoantibodies can exhibit histamine-releasing properties, not all of the autoantibodies proved to be functional in vitro. Our results indicate that the occurrence of IgG anti-FcepsilonRIalpha reactivity defines an autoimmune-mediated subentity of CU and provide a basis for the development of new diagnostic procedures and, perhaps, therapeutic strategies for this disease...|$|E

This is acknowledged in consensus documents. The drug also has a good safety profile and a pharmacoeconomic advantage due {{to a reduction in}} the number of hospitalizations for asthma attacks. In recent years, some studies have shown that omalizumab is effective also in nonallergic asthma. Effects on the complex signaling mechanisms leading to activation of effector cells and to mediator release may account for this outcome. Indeed, omalizumab has been reported to be effective in a number of IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated disorders. Concerning the former, clinical efficacy has been observed in rhinitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, latex allergy, atopic dermatitis, <b>allergic</b> <b>urticaria,</b> and anaphylaxis. In addition, omalizumab has been demonstrated to be able to prevent systemic reactions to allergen immunotherapy, thus enabling completion of treatment in patients who otherwise would have to stop it. Concerning non-IgE-mediated disorders, omalizumab has been reported to be effective in nasal polyposis, autoimmune urticaria, chronic idiopathic urticaria, physical urticaria, idiopathic angioedema, and mastocytosis. Current indications for treatment with omalizumab are confined to severe allergic asthma. Consequently, any other prescription can only be off-label. However, it is reasonable to expect that the use of omalizumab will be approved for particularly important indications, such as anaphylaxis, in the near future.

Consensus on the dietary recommendations {{that should be}} given to allergic patients is lacking. Our objective was to evaluate the usefulness of different types of diets in preventing further reactions in patients allergic to A. simplex. METHODS: Twenty-eight adult patients, who had suffered an allergic episode caused by A. simplex were asked to follow one of the following three diets for a mean period of 13. 16 months: a fish-free diet (diet 1; n = 19), a diet including fish frozen for more than 48 hours (diet 2; n = 9) and a diet with fresh fish (diet 3; n = 12). In all patients raw fish was excluded. Relapse rates and changes in total serum IgE and specific IgE to A. simplex were studied during the follow up. RESULTS: During the 13 -month follow-up none of the patients developed anaphylaxis. Urticaria symptoms were present in 5. 8 %, 11. 1 % (n. s) and 33. 3 % (p = 0. 016) of patients following diets 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Total IgE decreased by 64 % (p < 0. 05), 48 % (p < 0. 05) and 39. 4 % (p < 0. 05), respectively. Specific IgE to A. simplex decreased by 50. 7 % (p < 0. 05), 54. 1 % (p < 0. 05) and 23. 6 % (p < 0. 05) after diets 1, 2 and 3, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found among the groups in variations in total and specific IgE. CONCLUSIONS: Patients allergic to A. simplex can eat fish that has been frozen at - 20 C for 48 hours without risk of a severe allergic reaction. Long term decreases in specific and total IgE may not be good markers of eventual contact with A. simplex...|$|E

The article gives {{a critical}} review of the main epidemiological features of allergic diseases, their frequency, distribution and etiologic background {{as well as the}} possibilities of prevention and control, based on current literature. Statistical data for Croatia, collected by the Croatian National Institute of Public Health, are used to present actual epidemiological situation in Croatia. Basic descriptive epidemiological methods were used to express age and sex distribution, etc. In comments and review of preventive measures, our own epidemiological experiences and experience acquired on creating the national programs of health measures were used. The genesis of allergies usually implies the influence of various potent environmental allergens such as proteins or smaller molecules attached to proteins (haptens) through repeat or continuous exposure by contact, alimentary or respiratory route, and parenteral route as most efficient (mucous membrane exposure is similar to parenteral exposure). In addition, almost all substances from our environment may, under certain circumstances, become allergens and produce allergic reaction. Individual constitution that is inherited also plays a role. Allergic diseases are present all over the world, however, with variable frequency. Response to an allergen is generally the same, causing distinct allergic diseases like urticaria, anaphylactic shock, asthma, etc., while the main allergens can be different. It is estimated that 30 %- 40 % of all people have some type or manifestation of allergy. According to our Institute data, in Croatia hospitalization was mostly required for <b>allergic</b> <b>urticaria</b> and allergic asthma, followed by Quincke’s edema. Optimal treatment and appropriate healthcare structure are essential for efficient control and prevention of allergic diseases. The main direct elements are as follows: well organized emergency service for anaphylactic and other severe conditions; health education expected from all levels of healthcare system; allergology outpatient services available; and sufficient hospital capacities. An indirect yet important element is optimal drug prescribing and usage practice. Other specific public health measures include: pollen air concentration monitoring by public health institutes; information on particular allergen presence and intensity via public media; and control of potential allergen emission into the environment, especially air. People will, as always, find ways to adapt themselves and cope with allergies, with medical profession helping them by identifying the reasons causing allergic diseases and developing successful measures of treatment, prevention and control...|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Allergic</b> {{rhinitis}} and <b>urticaria</b> are chronic persistent allergic {{conditions that}} need proper management as they significantly reduce {{quality of life}} measures. Of the many pharmacological options of <b>allergic</b> rhinitis and <b>urticaria,</b> second-generation antihistamines are the mainstay of therapy. Aims: This review focuses on the knowledge of medical residents toward prescribing antihistamines, {{according to the new}} ARIA and GA 2 LEN guidelines for <b>allergic</b> rhinitis and <b>urticaria,</b> attempting to find the cause of less prescription of newer second-generation antihistamines by finding out the knowledge and attitude of the doctors prescribing them to the patients. Materials and Methods: The study was carried out among resident doctors at a tertiary care teaching hospital. Primary data from 100 resident doctors, who gave their informed consent, was collected. A prevalidated questionnaire regarding knowledge, attitude and prescribing practice of antihistamines was filled up. The data was then analyzed with suitable statistical tests. Every question was first validated using the Chi-square test, and significance was below 10 % hence proving validity of the questions. Results: Out of the doctors surveyed, 82 % of doctors said they prescribed second-generation antihistamines, while 18 % still prescribed first-generation antihistamines. Out of the 82 % that prescribed second-generation antihistamines, 8. 9 % also prescribed first-generation antihistamines as well. 23 % of doctors surveyed had heard about the ARIA and GAL 2 EN guidelines and their recommendations for prescribing second-generation antihistamines over the older first-generation antihistamines, while 77 % of them had not heard of these position papers. Conclusion: First-generation or classic antihistamines are still overused {{due to the lack of}} knowledge of various guidelines that have been published. The main reason for not prescribing the second-generation antihistamines was due to the increased cost per tablet compared to the more economical first-generation antihistamines...|$|R

40|$|Omalizumab is a {{recombinant}} humanized {{monoclonal antibody}} that reduces levels of circulating IgE and expres-sion of IgE high affinity receptor (FCeRI) on mast cells and basophils. Its {{role in the}} therapy of <b>allergic</b> asthma and <b>urticaria</b> is well established. According to GINA guidelines, omalizumab {{should be considered as}} an important alter-native to systemic corticosteroids in uncontrolled asthma. Several ongoing trials will evaluate omalizumab efficacy in the treatment of other allergic diseases and conditions. Further studies are needed to answer several practical questions on the optimal duration of treatment and possible biomarkers to predefine a cohort of responders to this therapy. Key words: omalizumab, immunoglobulin E, <b>allergic</b> asthma, <b>urticaria.</b> Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclo-nal antibody that selectively binds to the Ce 3 domain of free immunoglobulin E (IgE), forming complexes with circulating IgE and reducing its levels. By preventing IgE interaction with the high-affinity IgE receptor (FCeRI) on mast cells and basophils, release of soluble pro-inflam-matory mediators is decreased. Moreover, a reduction in free IgE leads to significant down-regulation of the FCeRI expression on inflammatory cells and reduction in cells’ influx (including eosinophils) to the site of inflammation. Subsequently, allergic inflammation is modulated and symptoms of allergic diseases are decreased. Omalizum-ab is administered subcutaneously in doses dependent on the baseline total IgE level and body mass. In Europe, omalizumab is currently approved for the treatment of children, adolescents and adults (aged 6 years and above) with severe allergic asthma in whom symptoms are not well controlled despite high doses of inhaled cor-ticosteroid (ICS) and long acting...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Bilastine {{is a new}} oral, second {{generation}} antihistamine used in the symptomatic treatment of <b>allergic</b> rhinoconjunctivitis and <b>urticaria.</b> It is considered a nonsedating antihistamine and might be recommended for use in pilots, pending research on the effects on flying-related performance under hypobaric conditions that prevail in an airliner. We assessed {{the effects of a}} single dose of bilastine 20 mg on alertness and complex task performance of healthy volunteers in a hypobaric chamber at 75. 2 kPa (8000 ft/ 2438 m cabin altitude). METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, 24 volunteers received a single dose of bilastine 20 mg, hydroxyzine 50 mg (active control), and placebo. Using the Vigilance and Tracking Task, Multi-Attribute Task Battery, and Stanford Sleepiness Scale, assessments were made before and up to 6 h after intake of the study medication. RESULTS: Bilastine 20 mg had no impairing effects on sleepiness levels, vigilance, or complex task performance for up to 6 h post-dose. Hydroxyzine 50 mg (active control) was associated with significant sleepiness and impaired performance across this time period, confirming the sensitivity of the tests. CONCLUSION: Bilastine 20 mg did not cause sleepiness or impaired performance on tasks related to flying. It is anticipated that a single dose of bilastine 20 mg will not affect flying performance. Bilastine may provide a safe therapeutic alternative for pilots suffering from <b>allergic</b> rhinitis or <b>urticaria.</b> Our findings might also have implications for the treatment of allergic disorders of personnel involved in other safety-sensitive jobs...|$|R

5000|$|The {{commonly}} quoted {{figure of}} 10% {{of patients with}} allergic hypersensitivity to penicillins and/or carbapenems also having cross-reactivity with cephalosporins originated from a 1975 study looking at the original cephalosporins, and subsequent [...] "safety first" [...] policy meant this was widely quoted and assumed to apply to {{all members of the}} group. Hence, it was commonly stated that they are contraindicated in patients with a history of severe, immediate <b>allergic</b> reactions (<b>urticaria,</b> anaphylaxis, interstitial nephritis, etc.) to penicillins, carbapenems, or cephalosporins. [...] This, however, should be viewed in the light of recent epidemiological work suggesting, for many second-generation (or later) cephalosporins, the cross-reactivity rate with penicillin is much lower, having no significantly increased risk of reactivity over the first generation based on the studies examined. The British National Formulary previously issued blanket warnings of 10% cross-reactivity, but, since the September 2008 edition, suggests, in the absence of suitable alternatives, oral cefixime or cefuroxime and injectable cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone can be used with caution, but the use of cefaclor, cefadrocil, cefalexin, and cefradine should be avoided.|$|R
40|$|Skin {{inflammation}} {{caused by}} an allergy has affected patients for years now. The most common ones namely <b>urticaria,</b> <b>allergic</b> contact dermatitis and atopic eczema really influence {{the quality of life}} of patients through the appearance of discomforting symptoms such as pruritus. The aim of this analysis is to understand the known pathomechanism of allergic dermatitis and to enumerate the different types of therapies available with the support of research findings and published articles in the recommended guidelines in the management of such diseases. A comparative study among the available treatment options will also be provided. The discovery of novel pathogenic mechanism will be scrutinized for the development of new therapeutic approaches. egységes, osztatlanáltalános orvosango...|$|R
40|$|Atopic eczema is {{a common}} {{disorder}} affecting about 3 % of {{children under the age}} of 5 and producing much personal and family distress. It markedly improves or spontaneously resolves in most of these by the mid-teens, but in some individuals eczema will reappear later on. The cause is unknown, and there is no convincing evidence yet that food intolerance, including food allergy, is more than occasionally present or relevant. The term atopy indicates an inherited tendency to develop one or more of a related group of conditions (asthma, eczema of atopic type, <b>allergic</b> rhinitis, acute <b>urticaria</b> of <b>allergic</b> type) subject to much environmental influence. More than 10 % of the British population are atopic, and allergic rhinitis i...|$|R
