5|$|Adolphus Herbert Frederick Norman Appleroth, {{known as}} Bert Appleroth, was a tram {{conductor}} who created jelly crystals using gelatine <b>and</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>in</b> his bathtub. He sold these jelly crystals door-to-door, using his tram route to transport him around Sydney. In 1917, Appleroth rented premises to manufacture his jelly, then formed {{a company with}} Albert Francis Lenertz named Traders Pty Ltd in 1927. Planes were considered new and exciting at the time, so aviation fan Appleroth named the brand Aeroplane Jelly. Appleroth used a Tiger Moth plane to make deliveries to rural areas in 1934, and his publicity stunts and Aeroplane Jelly's advertising campaigns made the jelly a national icon, like Holden and Vegemite.|$|E

5|$|Prevention {{includes}} {{hand washing}} with soap, drinking clean water, proper disposal of human waste, and breastfeeding babies {{instead of using}} formula. The rotavirus vaccine is recommended in children. Treatment involves getting enough fluids. For mild or moderate cases, this can typically be achieved by drinking oral rehydration solution (a combination of water, salts, <b>and</b> <b>sugar).</b> <b>In</b> those who are breast fed, continued breastfeeding is recommended. For more severe cases, intravenous fluids may be needed. Fluids may also be given by a nasogastric tube. Zinc supplementation is recommended in children. Antibiotics are generally not needed.|$|E

25|$|As the Deep South was {{developed}} for cotton <b>and</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>in</b> {{the first half of}} the nineteenth century, demand for slaves increased. This resulted in a massive forced migration (through the slave trade) of more than one million African Americans from the Upper South to the Deep South. Many traders brought slaves to New Orleans for domestic sale, and by 1840, New Orleans had the largest slave market in the country, was the third-largest city, and was one of the wealthiest cities.|$|E
25|$|In 1814, {{during the}} War of 1812, a British fleet {{launched}} a successful Raid on Alexandria, which surrendered without a fight. As agreed {{in the terms}} of surrender the British looted stores and warehouses of mainly flour, tobacco, cotton, wine, <b>and</b> <b>sugar.</b> <b>In</b> 1823 William Holland Wilmer, Francis Scott Key, and others founded the Virginia Theological Seminary. From 1828 to 1836, Alexandria was home to the Franklin & Armfield Slave Market, one of the largest slave trading companies in the country. By the 1830s, they were sending more than 1,000 slaves annually from Alexandria to their Natchez, Mississippi, and New Orleans markets to help meet the demand for slaves in Mississippi and surrounding states. Later owned by Price, Birch & Co., the slave pen became a jail under Union occupation.|$|E

25|$|For a sweet wine, {{fermentation}} {{is stopped}} before its end {{to keep some}} of the sugar: this is the Mutage (fortification). The fermentation can be stopped by adding Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) (sterilisation of wine), by sudden cooling (anaesthesia of yeasts), by sterile filtration (capturing the yeasts in a very fine mesh filter), {{or a combination of}} several of these methods. A rule of thumb for determining the point of mutage, which allows a good balance of acquired alcohol and residual sugar, is to leave as many potential degrees as the degrees acquired over 10% by volume. For sweeter dessert wines fermentation stops spontaneously by excess sugar and alcohol: Alcohol is waste from the yeast and it is poisonous in large doses. In the case of sweet wines an addition of wine alcohol stops the fermentation. FML is not done for sweet wines as the lactic bacteria preferentially degrades sugar which would give a lactic bite (sweet and sour wine). In addition, the balance of acidity <b>and</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>in</b> the wine supports vivacity.|$|E

40|$|Determination of {{amino acids}} <b>and</b> <b>sugars</b> <b>in</b> green tea by anion-exchange {{chromatography}} with integrated pulsed amperometric detection was developed. Amino acids <b>and</b> <b>sugars</b> were separated on an anion-exchange column at a flow-rate of 0. 25 ml/min by using ternary gradient elution consisting of deionized water, 0. 25 M sodium hydroxide, and 1. 0 M sodium acetate. Under optimized conditions, theanine {{was separated from}} glutamine <b>and</b> three <b>sugars</b> (glucose, fructose, <b>and</b> sucrose) were eluted earlier than the neutral amino acids to avoid their interference with each other. RSDs of the peak area of analytes were lower than 4. 6 %. Detection limits for the analytes ranged from 0. 12 to 4. 9 pmol. The linearities for all analytes were two or three orders of magnitude, with the correlation coefficients greater than 0. 99. This method was applied to determination of amino acids <b>and</b> <b>sugars</b> <b>in</b> green tea with satisfactory results. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

500|$|Treatment {{of acute}} {{rotavirus}} infection is nonspecific and involves management of symptoms and, most importantly, management of dehydration. If untreated, children can {{die from the}} resulting severe dehydration. [...] Depending on the severity of diarrhoea, treatment consists of oral rehydration therapy, during which the child is given extra water to drink that contains small amounts of salt <b>and</b> <b>sugar.</b> <b>In</b> 2004, the WHO and UNICEF recommended the use of low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution and zinc supplementation as a two-pronged treatment of acute diarrhoea. Some infections are serious enough to warrant hospitalisation where fluids are given by intravenous therapy or nasogastric intubation, and the child's electrolytes and blood sugar are monitored. Probiotics {{have been shown to}} reduce the duration of rotavirus diarrhoea, and according to the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology [...] "effective interventions include administration of specific probiotics such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Saccharomyces boulardii, diosmectite or racecadotril." [...] Rotavirus infections rarely cause other complications and for a well managed child the prognosis is excellent.|$|E
500|$|In an October 2013 SPIN {{magazine}} article—a reflection at the ten-year {{anniversary of}} Smith's death—drummer McPherson stated that Smith was [...] "a sick man without his medicine" [...] {{during the last}} 31 days of his life, {{when he was not}} only sober, but had also given up red meat <b>and</b> <b>sugar.</b> <b>In</b> the same article, Chiba recalls thinking, [...] "Okay, you're asking a lot of yourself.

[...] Chiba further explained that [...] "anyone who understands drug abuse knows that you use drugs to hide from your past or sedate yourself from strong, overwhelming feelings. So when you're newly clean and coming off the medications that have been masking all those feelings, that's when you're the most vulnerable." [...] Writing for SPIN, Liam Gowing also encountered a local musician who stated that Smith had said to him: [...] "The people who try to intervene, they're good people who genuinely care about you. But they don't know what you're going through. Do what you need to do." [...] According to the musician, Smith had adamantly dissuaded him from suicide.|$|E

2500|$|A supertaster is {{a person}} whose sense of taste is {{significantly}} more sensitive than average.

Studies have shown that supertasters require less fat <b>and</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>in</b> their food {{to get the same}} satisfying effects. However, contrary to what one might think, these people actually tend to consume more salt than the average person.

(This also explains why supertasters prefer salted cheddar cheese over non-salted.) ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1979, 138 {{inhabitants}} of Palm Island, Queensland, Australia, were admitted to hospital, suffering various symptoms of gastroenteritis. All {{of these were}} children; in addition, 10 adults were affected but not hospitalised. Initial symptoms, including abdominal pain and vomiting, resembled those of hepatitis; later symptoms included kidney failure and bloody diarrhoea. Urine analysis revealed high levels of proteins, ketones <b>and</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>in</b> many patients, along with blood and urobilinogen in lesser numbers. The urine analysis, along with faecal microscopy and poison screening, could not provide a statistical link to the symptoms.

2500|$|In Portuguese-, Spanish- and Italian-speaking countries, among others, it {{is known}} as Carnival (to use the English spelling). This derives from Medieval Latin carnelevamen ("the putting away of flesh") and thus to {{another aspect of the}} Lenten fast. It is often {{celebrate}}d with street processions or fancy dress. The most famous of these events is the Brazilian Carnival in Rio de Janeiro, while the Venetians celebrate carnival with a masquerade. The use of the term [...] "carnival" [...] in other contexts derives from here. In Spain, the Carnival Tuesday is named [...] "día de la tortilla" [...] ("omelette day"): an omelette made with some sausage or pork fat is eaten. On the Portuguese island of Madeira, they eat malasadas on Terça-feira Gorda (Fat Tuesday in English) which is also {{the last day of the}} Carnival of Madeira. Malasadas were cooked in order to use up all the lard <b>and</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>in</b> the house, in preparation for Lent. This tradition was taken to Hawaii, where Shrove Tuesday is known as Malasada Day, which dates back to the days of the sugar plantations of the 1800s, the resident Catholic Portuguese (mostly from Madeira and the Azores) workers used up butter and sugar prior to Lent by making large batches of malasadas.|$|E
