2500|$|Rachael Blampied had auditioned 5 {{times for}} Shortland Street, with her last being {{for the role}} of Zlata Waldheim. However Blampied was turned down every time as she looked too similar to one of the core actresses, Beth Allen (who portrayed Brooke Freeman). After she auditioned {{for the role of}} Zlata, {{producers}} decided to utilise their similarities and create the role of Bree – a sister for Brooke, specifically for her. Blampied received a call in mid-2011 asking if she was eager to accept the role. She was extremely pleased with the call, saying; [...] "It's the best phone call an actor can wish for – that they're writing a part for you on a show {{you really want to be}} on.

In November TVNZ announced that a new addition would be arriving to Brooke's dysfunctional family, with Bree arriving on 9 December. Blampied enjoyed working alongside her screen sister, Allen and Pua Magasiva (who portrayed Brooke's boyfriend Vinnie), saying; [...] "I've had some great scenes with Beth and Pua, which have been enormous fun as they're such generous actors and are heaps of fun to hang out with!" [...] The character was originally envisioned to be killed off at the end of her stint, but producers were so impressed with Blampied that they rewrote the characters ending by sending her to a psychiatric hospital. Blampied was not aware as to what Bree was to endure throughout her stint but was informed that she was always going to leave after her initial storyline came to an end. She was sad to leave the soap but pleased with her exit, [...] "I was sad to have to leave the show, but it's not a closed exit.

50|$|A {{much more}} active {{approach}} to monitoring tire pressures involves retrofitting a tire pressure monitor to your vehicle. Vehicles manufactured after model year 2007 are required <b>to</b> <b>have</b> tire pressure monitoring systems built-in, although many older vehicles {{might not have}} it. Tire rack, for example, offers aftermarket tire pressure monitors from various companies, including one that notifies {{the driver of the}} tire pressure in each wheel, as well as exactly which tire the system is displaying the pressure of. A much less expensive way to monitor tire pressures is to install valve stem caps that alert the driver to low tire pressure. These work by first setting the pressure on the cap matching the pressure you desire your tires to be at. Once installed on the tire's valve stem, the tip of these caps will change color (from green, to yellow, to red) when the tire becomes under-inflated. The benefit of this system is its low initial cost, but its disadvantages include questionable accuracy (even more so if the caps aren't tightened down enough) and {{that the only way to}} monitor them is from outside of the vehicle, looking directly at the cap. It's <b>always</b> a <b>good</b> idea <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a quality, reliable tire gauge on hand regardless of what system is installed in your vehicle, and to either check tire pressures yourself of by having someone else do it, as most tire pressure monitor systems will not alert the driver until the tire pressure falls below a certain amount, usually 20% below the recommended pressure.|$|R
60|$|I cannot say so {{much about}} Professor Blackie, for a good reason. Kelland's class I attended, once even gained there a {{certificate}} of merit, the only distinction of my University career.

Professor Blackie was even kind enough to remark (more than once) while in the very act of writing the document above referred to, {{that he did not know}} my face.

Widespread speculation about the identity of Sam's father was reignited when it was rumored that General Hospital was looking for a [...] "name actor" [...] to cast in the role of Sam's father. Rumors began to circulate naming Duke Lavery (Ian Buchanan), Blackie Parrish (John Stamos) and Dr. Kevin Collins (Jon Lindstrom) as potential candidates for Sam's father; Lindstrom having previously worked opposite Monaco as her father on the soap opera Port Charles. [...] Another rumor emerged that veteran soap actor, Peter Reckell, who played Bo Brady on the NBC soap opera Days of Our Lives from 1983-2012, would be joining General Hospital in the role of Evan Jerome. It was widely speculated that Reckell was cast to play Sam's father, linking her to the Jerome crime family that was prominent on General Hospital in the 1980s. However, after weeks of speculation, Reckell addressed the rumors stating that he wasn't going back to Days of Our Lives or joining any other soap.

40|$|The {{successful}} {{story of}} fiber optics has demonstrated {{the superiority of}} optical communications over competing technologies in long-haul data transmissions. Now, short-range high-capacity data interconnects are envisioned as the next field where optics and photonics technologies are likely to play a revolutionary role. In this contest, energy consumption per bit is the key number, and photon transmission is potentially much less power hungry than electronic transmission. This is the reason why, in a near future, massive data exchanges between and inside supercomputers {{are expected to be}} carried by photons. A part of this new story has already become reality. Board-to-board interconnects in supercomputers are already performed though multimode fiber links, providing high-bandwidth-density wirings with lower power consumption than that required by electric cables. But we can definitely do more; we can try to bring photons {{closer and closer to the}} brain of supercomputers. The new frontier is chip-to-chip optical interconnects, that is photonics links providing high-capacity and energy saving communications between electronic chips. Although this research field has been under the lens for several years, a winner photonic technology has not emerged yet. And the race is getting faster and faster. Silicon photonics is considered one of the most promising technology candidates, because it enables the integration of fast modulators, wide-band routing and switching architectures, and photodetectors onto the same chip. In other words, all we need for realizing end-to-end optical links on a chip. Yet, nothing is for free, and silicon photonics has still to solve challenging issues related to strong sensitivity to fabrication tolerances, and to temperature and environmental fluctuations. Another option is given by the use of multimode polymer waveguide arrays, which are drawing much attention because they offer high-density wirings with very low-propagation loss, low interchannel crosstalk, high bandwidth, and high coupling efficiency with multimode fiber, VCSELs and photo detectors (PDs). The main issue with this technology is the development of a simple, low-cost and reliable process to fabricate cm-scale long waveguide arrays with inter-waveguide pitches of a few tens of μm. A very original and surprisingly effective solution has been proposed by Kinoshita and co-workers, who have developed the so-called Mosquito method. In this technique, UV curable silicone resins are employed for fabricating the core and the cladding of polymer optical waveguides. The core resin is dispensed into the cladding resin, deposited in a liquid phase on a substrate from a needle mounted on a syringe, whose position is controlled by a horizontally scanning robot. After UV curing and baking of the core and cladding resins, a circularly-shaped core waveguide with a graded-index profile is magically obtained. This method allows the simplification of the fabrication of polymer optical waveguides, since photomasks, large-scale UV exposure apparatus, and chemical etching processes are no longer needed. Further, graded index core waveguides exhibit better performance than step-index waveguides in terms of loss and mutual optical crosstalk. By optimizing the fabrication process, waveguide arrays with a circular core of 50 μm and a pitch as small as 62. 5 -μm have been realized in this work, with an impressive control of waveguide size, spacing and circularity. The suitability of the Mosquito method for high-bandwidth-density on-board and board-to-board optical interconnects is confirmed by the demonstration of 12 x 11. 3 Gbps signal transmissions in an array of 12 waveguides without any signal deterioration. This successful result is a clear demonstration that technological processes must not be stuck in conventional schemes, because different ways of thinking are the primary key to the most significant advances. It is difficult to say at this point if the Mosquito method has the potential to compete with more consolidated photonic technologies, but it is <b>always</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> alternative routes to follow.
