40|$|Abstract: Innovations in {{the field}} of <b>assembling</b> <b>systems</b> are going in many directions. One of them is a {{creation}} {{of a new generation of}} automated assembly systems, based on natural phenomena. Bionic Assembly System (BAS) is a new concept of advanced <b>assembling</b> <b>system,</b> which combines two basic control structures and principles: centralized control system, based on the hierarchy and self-organizing control system, based on the heterarchy. This paper describes hybrid control structure, working scenarios, scheduling, reconfigurations and logic of working cycles during the assembly of one unlimited sequence of assembly orders. These systems have some additional possibilities for minimization of <b>assembling</b> time using <b>system</b> and layout reconfiguration. Different possibilities of the reconfiguration of BAS are shown in this paper...|$|R
40|$|A recent {{trend in}} supply chain {{management}} is to purchase fully <b>assembled</b> <b>systems</b> from suppliers rather than ordering components. When purchasing <b>assembled</b> <b>systems,</b> a manufacturer can test the assembled unit and hold the supplier accountable for sys-tem failures; however she cannot control the assembly effort. On the other hand, when a manufacturer purchases components, she controls the assembly process, yet she may {{find it difficult to}} hold the suppliers accountable for the performance of the finished product. In this paper, I explore the manufacturer’s delegation decision when her sup-plier has a liability constraint. My results are specific to the type of effort used to <b>assemble</b> <b>systems.</b> When <b>systems</b> can be <b>assembled</b> with only binary effort, the manu-facturer prefers to <b>assemble</b> the <b>system</b> herself whenever feasible. However, if assembly effort is continuous, then delegation is optimal when the supplier’s cost of producing high quality components is large and his liability constraint is lax. Surprisingly, I find that if the manufacturer cannot penalize the supplier for systems which pass testing but fail in the field, then delegation becomes even more attractive. Finally, I demon-strate that a manufacturer will always perform more testing when the supplier builds the system relative to when the manufacturer <b>assembles</b> the <b>system.</b> ∗I am thankful for helpful comments from Stan Baiman, Erica Plambeck, Madhav Rajan, John Roberts and Stefan Reichelstein.

50|$|The Big Board {{was sold}} as an {{unpopulated}} {{printed circuit board}} with sockets for integrated circuits, with documentation and options to purchase additional components.The Big Board design was simple enough to build a system around that many people with no prior electronics experience were able to build and bring up a capable computer system of their own at a cost far less than that of a fully <b>assembled</b> <b>system</b> of the time. In this way, the Big Boards anticipated the DIY PC clones that became popular later. In its most popular form, the fully assembled and tested Big Board need only be connected to a power supply, one or two eight inch floppy disk drives, a composite monitor, and an ASCII encoded keyboard in order to provide a fully functioning system. A serial terminal could be used in place of the monitor and keyboard, further simplifying assembly. The only tool required for basic assembly was a screwdriver for the terminal block power connections.|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of experimental dynamic substructuring, substructure decoupling consists {{in the identification of}} the dynamic behaviour of a structural subsystem, starting from the dynamic behaviour of both the <b>assembled</b> <b>system</b> and the residual subsystem (the known portion of the <b>assembled</b> <b>system).</b> On the contrary, substructure coupling identifies an <b>assembled</b> <b>system</b> starting from the component subsystems. The degrees of freedom (DoFs) of the <b>assembled</b> <b>system</b> can be partitioned into internal DoFs (not belonging to the couplings) and coupling DoFs. In substructure coupling, whenever coupling DoFs include rotational DoFs, the related rotational FRFs must be obtained experimentally. Does this requirement holds for substructure decoupling too, as it is commonly believed? Decoupling can be ideally accomplished by adding the negative of the residual subsystem to the <b>assembled</b> <b>system</b> (direct decoupling) and by enforcing compatibility and equilibrium at enough interface DoFs. Ideally, every DoF of the residual subsystem belongs to the interface between the <b>assembled</b> <b>system</b> and the residual subsystem. Hopefully, not all the coupling DoFs are necessary to enforce compatibility and equilibrium. This may allow us to skip coupling DoFs and specifically rotational DoFs. The goal of the paper is indeed to establish if rotational FRFs at coupling DoFs can be neglected in substructure decoupling. To this aim, after highlighting the possibility of avoiding the use of coupling DoFs from a theoretical standpoint, a test bed coupled through flexural and torsional DoFs is considered. Experimental results are presented and discussed...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{and investigate}} string <b>assembling</b> <b>systems</b> which form a computational model that generates strings from copies {{out of a}} finite set of assembly units. The underlying mechanism is based on piecewise assembly of a double-stranded sequence of symbols, where {{the upper and lower}} strand have to match. The generation is additionally controlled by the requirement that the first symbol of a unit has to be the same as the last symbol of the strand generated so far, {{as well as by the}} distinction of assembly units that may appear at the beginning, during, and at the end of the assembling process. We start to explore the generative capacity of string <b>assembling</b> <b>systems.</b> In particular, we prove that any such system can be simulated by some nondeterministic one-way two-head finite automaton, while the stateless version of the two-head finite automaton marks to some extent a lower bound for the generative capacity.

40|$|Substructure {{decoupling}} {{consists in}} the identification of the dynamic behaviour of a structural subsystem, starting from the dynamic behaviour of both the <b>assembled</b> <b>system</b> and the residual subsystem (the known portion of the <b>assembled</b> <b>system).</b> The degrees of freedom (DoFs) of the coupled system can be partitioned into internal DoFs (not belonging to the couplings) and coupling DoFs. In direct decoupling, a fictitious subsystem that is the negative of the residual subsystem is added to the coupled system, and appropriate compatibility and equilibrium conditions are enforced at interface DoFs. Compatibility and equilibrium can be required either at coupling DoFs only (standard interface), or at additional internal DoFs of the residual subsystem (extended interface), or at some coupling DoFs and some internal DoFs of the residual subsystem (mixed interface). In this paper, a test bench is considered made by a cantilever column with two staggered short arms coupled to a horizontal beam. This involves both flexural and torsional DoFs, on which rotational FRFs are quite difficult to measure. Using a mixed interface, rotational DoFs are neglected and substituted by internal translational DoFs. Experimental results are presented and discussed...|$|E
