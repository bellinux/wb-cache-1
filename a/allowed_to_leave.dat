5|$|The Nafana {{people say}} that they come from a village called Kakala in Ivory Coast. Their oral history says {{that some of their}} people are still there, and if they go back they will not be <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> again. They arrived in the Banda area after the Ligbi people, who came from Begho (Bigu, Bighu) to the area in the early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Adamle's {{decision}} {{to drop out}} was controversial because of rules that under normal circumstances would have barred him from playing professionally before graduating. The interruption of the war had forced the suspension of the rule to account for players' military service, however, and he was <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> college. The Browns denied that they encouraged Adamle to drop out. Adamle may have been convinced to join the Browns by Gene Fekete, Dante Lavelli, Lou Groza and Bill Willis, four Browns players who were back at Ohio State to finish their studies after the 1946 season.|$|E

5|$|East German {{citizens}} {{could also}} emigrate through the semi-secret route of being ransomed by the West German {{government in a}} process termed Freikauf (literally the buying of freedom). Between 1964 and 1989, 33,755political prisoners were ransomed. A further 2,087prisoners were released to the West under an amnesty in 1972. Another 215,000people, including 2,000children cut off from their parents, were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> East Germany to rejoin their families. In exchange, West Germany paid over 3.4 billion DM– nearly $2.3billion at 1990 prices– in goods and hard currency.|$|E
5|$|Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester, {{intervened in}} an attempt to produce a {{negotiated}} solution. Henry reached an agreement whereby after five weeks, the castle finally surrendered; the garrison were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> peacefully but the castle was handed over to the king. The deal struck by Miles and Henry appears to have left the surrounding estates {{in the hands of the}} Beauchamps, however, and in 1141 Miles returned and retook the castle itself, although no details are available as to how he achieved this.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Yasui was <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the {{internment}} {{camp in the}} summer and was employed in Chicago before moving to Denver, Colorado, in September 1944.

The following year in November he married former internee True Shibata, and they would have three daughters together, Iris, Holly, and Laurel.|$|E

5|$|On November 11, 1793, Charles IV {{dissolved}} the society. Soon {{the newspaper}} disappeared as well. Espejo {{had no choice}} but to work as a librarian in the National Library. Because of his liberal ideas, he was imprisoned on January 30, 1795, being <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> his cell only to treat his patients as a doctor and, on December 23, to die at his home from the dysentery he acquired during his imprisonment. Eugenio Espejo died on December 28. His death certificate was registered in the book for Indians, mestizos, blacks and mulattoes.|$|E
5|$|Paris {{was finally}} recaptured by Charles VII of France in 1436. When the French king re-entered the city, his enemies in Paris {{fortified}} {{themselves in the}} Bastille; after a siege, they eventually ran out of food, surrendered and were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the city after the payment of a ransom. The castle remained a key Parisian fortress, but was successfully seized by the Burgundians in 1464, when they convinced royal troops to surrender: once taken, this allowed their faction to make a surprise attack into Paris, almost resulting in the capture of the king.|$|E
5|$|While {{officers}} were typically <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> their ships—with two notable exceptions—civilian technicians (some of them British), machinists, and other integral crewmen {{were not given}} the same opportunity. These exceptions came on Minas Geraes, whose {{officers were}} surprised but had time to draw their weapons and defend themselves. The ship's captain, , {{was killed in the}} fighting along with several loyal and rebel crewmen. Any other bloodshed was much more limited: on the cruiser Bahia, the only officer aboard was killed after he shot a rebel crewman, and one lieutenant on São Paulo killed himself.|$|E

5|$|Arafat {{was finally}} <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> his {{compound}} on 2 May 2002 after intense negotiations {{led to a}} settlement: six PFLP militants, including the organization's secretary-general Ahmad Sa'adat, wanted by Israel, who had been holed up with Arafat in his compound, would be transferred to international custody in Jericho. After the wanted men were handed over the siege was lifted. With that, and a promise that he would issue {{a call to the}} Palestinians to halt attacks on Israelis, Arafat was released. He issued such a call on 8 May. On 19 September 2002, the IDF largely demolished the compound with armored bulldozers in order to isolate Arafat. In March 2003, Arafat ceded his post as Prime Minister to Mahmoud Abbas amid pressures by the US.|$|E

5|$|Following some fruitless negotiations, {{the women}} and {{children}} were <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the house, and then both sides began firing. After about an hour, McFarlane called a ceasefire; according to some, a white flag had been waved in the house. As McFarlane stepped into the open, a shot rang out from the house, and he fell mortally wounded. The enraged rebels then set fire to the house, including the slave quarters, and Kirkpatrick surrendered. The number of casualties at Bower Hill is unclear; McFarlane and one or two other militiamen were killed; one U.S. soldier may have died from wounds received in the fight. The rebels sent the U.S. soldiers away. Kirkpatrick, Lenox, and Presley Neville were kept as prisoners, but they later escaped.|$|E

5|$|He {{was sold}} to English First Division club Charlton Athletic in January 1987 for a fee of £125,000. He played at Wembley Stadium in {{the final of the}} Full Members Cup on 29 March, which ended in a 1–0 defeat to Blackburn Rovers. Charlton {{finished}} the 1986–87 season in the relegation play-off place, but retained their top-flight status after beating Leeds United 2–1 in a replay in the play-off final, following a 1–1 aggregate draw. Milne only played as a late substitute in the first leg at Selhurst Park, and ended the game with a broken jaw after being elbowed by Micky Adams. He dropped out of manager Lennie Lawrence's first team plans during the 1987–88 season, and was <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the club.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, Sitting Bull was <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the {{reservation}} to go Wild Westing with Buffalo Bill Cody’s Buffalo Bill's Wild West. He earned about $50 {{a week for}} riding once around the arena, {{where he was a}} popular attraction. Although it is rumored that he cursed his audiences in his native tongue during the show, the historian Utley contends that he did not. Historians have reported that Sitting Bull gave speeches about his desire for education for the young, and reconciling relations between the Sioux and whites. The historian Edward Lazarus wrote that Sitting Bull reportedly cursed his audience in Lakota in 1884, during an opening address celebrating the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway.|$|E

The junta promised free and open elections to the presidency and the congress, as well as for a constituent assembly.|$|E
