40|$|This {{book draws}} on award-winning cross-generational {{research}} comparing {{the complex and}} life-changing processes of settlement among Albanian migrants and their adolescent children in three European cities: London (UK), Thessaloniki (Greece), and Florence (Italy). Building on key concepts from {{the social sciences and}} migration studies, such as identity, integration and transnationalism, the author links these with emerging theoretical notions, such as mobility, translocality and cosmopolitanism. Ethnic identities, transnational ties and integration pathways of the youngsters and adults are compared, focusing on intergenerational transmission in particular and recognizing mobility as an inherent characteristic of contemporary lives. Departing from the traditional focus on the adult children of settled migrants and the main immigration countries of continental North-Western Europe, this study centres on Southern Europe and Great Britain and a very recently settled immigrant group. The result is <b>an</b> illuminating <b>early</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> second generation “in-the-making”. Indeed, the findings provide ample grounds for pragmatic and forward-looking policy to enable these migrant-origin youngsters, and others like them, to more fully attain their potential. The book ends with a call to reassess the term “second generation” as it is currently used in policy and scholarly works. Children of migrants seldom see themselves as a particular and homogeneous group with ethnicity as an intrinsic identifying quality. More importantly, they make use of all the limited resources at their disposal, and view their integration processes through broader geographies – showing sometimes a cosmopolitan orientation, but also using localized reference points, such as the school, city, or urban neighbourhood...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} on the ultimate causes of the large di¤erences in economic development across countries has framed the issue as a com-petition between geography and institutions. Some papers claim to have evidence that geography explains nothing after controlling for in-stitutions. This paper argues and shows evidence that geography cor-relates with economic activity across regions within countries where institutions are far more constant than across countries. The paper also argues that mobility of factors can in theory completely mask the impact of geography if one <b>looks</b> only <b>at</b> output per-capita. Compar-ing cross-region with cross-country data and comparing regressions of output density with regressions of output per-capita, the paper …nds evidence of this mobility bias. Finally the paper tries to integrate re-cent lines of research with <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> line that <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> regional data as a laboratory to test for economies of scale. Overall the paper …nds evidence for three important determinants of spacial income levels: geography, institutions and agglomeration economies associated with very large urban areas.

5000|$|In the OECD report The Tying of Aid it {{was found}} that the motivations for tying aid were both {{economical}} and political. From the economic point of view, the donor country aims to raise its own exports. However, the study found that the exports related to tied aid were minimal. It referred to <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> study that <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the relation between exports from nine representative European donors and 32 representative developing countries.

Historical relations, trade relationships, geopolitical interests and cultural ties are all examples of the political motivations behind the tying of aid, but according to Jepma, they all boiled down to the same thing: Although most donors give aid to quite a wide variety of recipients, the importance they attach to individual recipients clearly differs: donors support countries with which they have, or hope to have, strong ties.|$|R

40|$|When formulating simple {{sentences}} {{to describe}} pictured events, speakers <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the referents they are describing {{in the order}} of mention. Accounts of incrementality in sentence production rely heavily on analyses of this gaze-speech link. To identify systematic sources of variability in message and sentence formulation, two experiments evaluated differences in formulation for sentences describing "easy" and "hard" events (more codable and less codable events) with preferred and dispreferred structures (actives and passives). Experiment 1 employed a subliminal cuing manipulation and a cumulative priming manipulation to increase production of passive sentences. Experiment 2 examined the influence of event codability on formulation without a cuing manipulation. In both experiments, speakers showed <b>an</b> <b>early</b> preference for <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the agent of the event when constructing active sentences. This preference was attenuated by event codability, suggesting that speakers were less likely to prioritize encoding of a single character at the outset of formulation in "easy" events than in "harder" events. Accessibility of the agent influenced formulation primarily when an event was "harder" to describe. Formulation of passive sentences in Experiment 1 also began with early fixations to the agent but changed with exposure to passive syntax: speakers were more likely to consider the patient as a suitable sentential starting point after cumulative priming. The results show that the message-to-language mapping in production can vary with the ease of encoding an event structure and of generating a suitable linguistic structure...|$|R
