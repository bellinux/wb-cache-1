40|$|An {{important}} conclusion {{from the}} acid rain research {{during the late}} 1970 's and the early 1980 's, was that humic substances (HS) in the water affected the response of acid rain. HS acts as a modifier on both the chemical composition and on the biological activity of acidified surface water. The Humex project will, by <b>artificial</b> <b>acidification</b> of a whole catchment, study the role of HS on the acidification {{and the role of}} acidification on the biological properties of HS. In fall 1988, a dystrophic lake was divided in two halves by a plastic curtain, {{from the middle of the}} natural outlet to the opposite side. During the following two years, through September 1990, the water chemistry of the two lake halves has been monitored and a number of scientists from Europe and North America have been studying the organic matter and the biota in the water, and in the catchment area prior to the <b>artificial</b> <b>acidification,</b> which started October 6 th 1990.

40|$|Influx of 45 Ca 2 + into Sacckomyces cerevisiae was {{measured}} under experimental conditions which enabled measurements of initial rate of transport across the plasma membrane, without interference by the vacuolar Ca 2 + transport system. Addition of glucose or glycerol to the cells, after pre-incubation in glucose-free medium for 5 rnin, caused a rapid, transient increase in 45 Ca 2 + influx, reaching a peak at 3 - 5 min after addition of substrate. Ethanol, or glycerol added with antimycin A, {{had no effect}} on 45 Ca 2 + infiux. We have shown previously that this increase is not mediated by an effect of the substrates on intracellular ATP levels. Changes in membrane potential accounted for only a part of the glucose-stimulated 45 Ca 2 + influx. The roles of intracellular acidification and changes in cellular cAMP in mediating the effects of glucose on 45 Ca 2 + influx were examined. After a short pre-incubation in glucose-free medium addition of glucose caused a decrease in the intracellular pH, [pHli, which reached a minimum value after 3 min. A transient increase in the cellular cAMP level was also observed. Addition of glycerol also caused intracellular acidification, but ethanol or glycerol added with antimycin A {{had no effect on}} [pHli. <b>Artificial</b> intracellular <b>acidification</b> induced by exposure to isobutyric acid or to CCCP caused a transient rise in Ca 2 + influx but the extent of the increase was smaller than that caused by glucose, and the time-course was Merent. We conclude that intracellular acidification may be responsible for part of the glucose stimulation of Ca 2 + influx. The role of the increase in cAMP level on Ca 2 + influx was examined by measuring the effect of glucos...|$|R
40|$|Since the 20 th century, the {{distribution}} of European heathlands rapidly decreased due to agricultural intensification, heavy use of <b>artificial</b> fertilizers or <b>acidification.</b> Therefore, various attempts of heathland restoration are under way in these days. Analysis of nematode community composition {{can be one of}} the tools suitable for succession evaluation. In 2011, 2013 and 2014, soil samples were collected from heathland restoration experiment (launched in 2011) where different restoration methods were applied in a 3 × 3 factorial experiment; existing heathlands were also sampled to identify the target community both in dry and wet heathland. A total of 60 samples of extracted nematodes were analysed for absolute abundance, trophic groups, and genera dominance. Various indices were calculated to describe the nematode community. We were able to proove faster development of wet heathlands towards the target community. However, because of large data variability, there was no significant difference between treatments. Development of wet and dry heathlands differed also in increased proportion of omniphagous nematodes in 2013 and predators in 2014 in dry heathlands. After three years of heathland restoration, nematode community has not yet reached parameters of the target community. Key words: Nematoda, [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} Mycobacterium as a {{pathogen}} hinges on {{its ability to}} modulate its intracellular environment. Mycobacterium avium reside in vacuoles with limited proteolytic activity, maintain cathepsin D in an immature form and remain accessible to internalized transferrin. <b>Artificial</b> <b>acidification</b> of isolated phagosomes facilitated processing of cathepsin D, demonstrating that pH alone limits proteolysis in these vacuoles. Moreover, analysis of IgG-bead phagosomes at early time points during their formation indicates that these phagosomes also acquire LAMP 1 and cathepsin D prior to the accumulation of proton-ATPases, and are transiently accessible to sorting endosomes. This suggests that the anomolous distribution of endosomal proteins in M. avium-containing vacuoles results from their arrested differentiation in an early transitional stage through which all phagosomes pass...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Ectromelia virus, {{a member}} of the Orthopox genus, is the causative agent of the highly {{infectious}} mousepox disease. Previous studies have shown that different poxviruses induce cell-cell fusion which is manifested by the formation of multinucleated-giant cells (polykaryocytes). This phenomenon has been widely studied with vaccinia virus in conditions which require <b>artificial</b> <b>acidification</b> of the medium. Results We show that Ectromelia virus induces cell-cell fusion under neutral pH conditions and requires the presence of a sufficient amount of viral particles on the plasma membrane of infected cells. This could be achieved by infection with a replicating virus and its propagation in infected cells (fusion "from within") or by infection with a high amount of virus particles per cell (fusion "from without"). Inhibition of virus maturation or inhibition of virus transport on microtubules towards the plasma membrane resulted in a complete inhibition of syncytia formation. We show that in contrast to vaccinia virus, Ectromelia virus induces cell-cell fusion irrespectively of its hemagglutination properties and cell-surface expression of the orthologs of the fusion inhibitory complex, A 56 and K 2. Additionally, cell-cell fusion was also detected in mice lungs following lethal respiratory infection. Conclusion Ectromelia virus induces spontaneous cell-cell fusion in-vitro and in-vivo although expressing an A 56 /K 2 fusion inhibitory complex. This syncytia formation property cannot be attributed to the 37 amino acid deletion in ECTV A 56. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} short-term acidification with HCl at a first-order {{stream in}} central Maine, USA {{was used to}} study processes controlling the changes in stream chemistry and to assess the ability of stream substrate to buffer pH. The streambed exerted a strong buffering capacity against pH change by ion exchange during the 6 -hour acidification. Streambed substrates had substantial cation and anion exchange capacity in the pH range of 4. 1 to 6. 5. The ion exchange for cations and SO 4 2 - were rapid and reversible. The speed of release of cations from stream substrates was Na 1 + > Ca 2 + > Mg 2 + > Al n+ > Be 2 +, perhaps relating to charge density of these cations. Ca 2 + desorption dominated neutralisation of excess H + for the first 2 hr. As the reservoir of exchangeable Ca diminished, desorption (and possibly dissolution) of Al 3 + became the dominant neutralising mechanism. The exchangeable (and possibly soluble) reservoir of Al was not depleted during the 6 -hour acidification. Sulphate adsorption during the acidification reduced the concentration of SO 4 2 - in stream water {{by as much as}} 20 ?eq L - 1 (from 70 ?eq L - 1). Desorption of SO 4 2 - and adsorption of base cations after the <b>artificial</b> <b>acidification</b> resulted in a prolongation of the pH depression. The streambed had the capacity to buffer stream water chemistry significantly during an acidifying event affecting the entire upstream catchment.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} cultivation of acid-loving {{plants such as}} blueberries, the <b>artificial</b> <b>acidification</b> of soils is frequently required. This research was conducted to determine the application rates of elemental sulfur (S) required in the soil acidification for blueberry cultivation. Laboratory incubation experiment was conducted to acidify three arable soils (pH 6 - 7) of different texture to pH 4. 5 - 5. 0 {{by the addition of}} varying amounts of elemental S. All rates of elemental S addition reduced soil pH, although the efficacy of acidification was related to the application rate and soil characteristics. pH reduction was slow in sandy loam soil, and the final equilibrium pH was obtained after 60, 43, and 30 days of incubation in sandy loam, loam, and silty clay, respectively. Although the final pHs obtained after 93 days of incubation were not significantly different among the three soils, the equilibrium pH was relatively higher in soil of higher clay content in the application rates of 1. 5 - 2. 0 g S kg- 1 soil. The estimated amounts of elemental S required in lowering pH to 4. 5 - 5. 0 were 0. 59 - 1. 01, 0. 67 - 1. 03, and 0. 53 - 0. 88 g S kg- 1 for sandy loam, loam, and silty clay, respectively. The lowest estimated amount of elemental S in the acidification of silty clay soil was attributable to the low organic matter content. For clay soils containing optimum level of organic matter, the application rates of elemental S should be much higher than those values estimated in this research. Soil acidification did not significantly increase the available concentrations of Ca, Mg and K. Extractable Cu and Zn was not greatly affected by the acidification, but extractable Fe, Mn, and Al in the acidified soils were higher than those found in non-acidified soils. Such increases in solubility are attributable to the dissolution of oxides and hydroxides of the elements...|$|E
