5|$|As a young woman, Lucy Mercer {{worked in}} a dress shop. In 1914, Mercer was hired by Eleanor Roosevelt to become her social secretary. Mercer quickly became an {{established}} part of the Roosevelt household, and good friends with Eleanor. According to historians Joseph Persico and Hazel Rowley, the affair between Mercer and Franklin likely began in 1916, when Eleanor <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> vacationing at Campobello Island to avoid the summer heat, while Franklin remained in Washington, D.C. In 1917, Franklin often included Mercer in his summer yachting parties, which Eleanor usually declined to attend.|$|E

The last lifeboat to reach the ship was Lightoller's boat No.12, with 74people aboard a boat designed to carry 65. They were all on Carpathia by 09:00. There were some scenes of joy as some families and friends were reunited, {{but in most cases}} hopes died as loved ones failed to reappear.|$|E

5|$|Sudirman {{first went}} to his {{official}} home and gathered sensitive documents, which he burned to prevent them falling into Dutch hands. His convoy, consisting of Sudirman, {{a small group of}} soldiers, and his personal doctor, then made their way south, towards Kretek, Parangtritis, Bantul. There they were received by the district head at 18:00. After several days in Kretek, during which time Sudirman sent undercover troops into the Dutch-occupied city for reconnaissance and to ask his wife for jewellery to sell and help fund the guerrilla movement, he and his group travelled east along the south coast to Wonogiri. Before the Dutch attack it had already been decided that Sudirman would be able to better control the guerrillas from eastern Java, where there were still several bases. Meanwhile, Alfiah <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> ordered to stay in the Kraton. Aware that he was being pursued by the Dutch, on 23 December Sudirman ordered his troops to continue to Ponorogo, where they stopped at the home of Mahfuz, a kyai and Islamic religious leader; Mahfuz gave the general a cane to help him walk, although Sudirman was, and continued to be, carried on a litter. They then continued east.|$|E
5|$|This {{proved a}} turning point in Eleanor and Sara's long-running struggle, and as Eleanor's public role grew, she {{increasingly}} broke from Sara's control. Tensions between Sara and Eleanor over her new political friends rose {{to the point that the}} family constructed a cottage at Val-Kill, in which Eleanor and her guests lived when Franklin <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> away from Hyde Park. Eleanor herself named the place Val-Kill, loosely translated as waterfall-stream from the Dutch language common to the original European settlers of the area. Franklin encouraged Eleanor to develop this property as a place where she could implement some of her ideas for work with winter jobs for rural workers and women. Each year, when Eleanor held a picnic at Val-Kill for delinquent boys, her granddaughter Eleanor Roosevelt Seagraves assisted her. She was close to Eleanor throughout her life. Seagraves concentrated her career as an educator and librarian on keeping alive many of the causes Eleanor began and supported.|$|E

Of the nuns, the large majority were Dutch Roman Catholic sisters, with a few English sisters. Initially there were 29 children in the compound, but by April 1943 there were 34. The oldest of these was seven when she entered the camp. None of the children died in the camp; the women often went without provisions to ensure the children's survival. A Roman Catholic priest from the nearby priests' compound came to the women's compound daily at 7am to say mass, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> taught by the nuns.|$|E

25|$|Northern Kuril Ainu (no known living {{population}} in Japan, existence not recognized by Russian government in Kamchatka Krai): Also known as Kurile in Russian records.

Major population {{was on the}} island of Shumshu, with a few others on islands like Paramushir. Altogether they numbered 221 in 1860. They had Russian names, spoke Russian fluently and were Russian Orthodox in religion. As the islands were given to the Japanese, more than a hundred Ainu fled to Kamchatka along with their Russian employers (where they were assimilated into the Kamchadal population). Only about half remained under Japanese rule. In order to derussify the Kurile, the entire population of 97 individuals was relocated to Shikotan in 1884, given Japanese names, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> enrolled in Japanese schools. Unlike the other Ainu groups, the Kurile failed to adjust to their new surroundings and by 1933 only 10 individuals were alive (plus another 34 multiracial individuals). The last group of 20 individuals (including a few pure-bloods) were evacuated to Hokkaido in 1941, where they vanished as a separate ethnic group soon after.|$|E

Consequently, Kafka's childhood was somewhat lonely, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> reared largely {{by a series of}} governesses and servants.

The dominating figure of Kafka's father had a significant influence on Kafka's writing.|$|E
