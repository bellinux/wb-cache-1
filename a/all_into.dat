5|$|Determined {{and with}} renewed hope, Twilight leads her best friends back to Ponyville, which Discord has altered in a chaotic manner: The day-night cycle is {{haphazard}} and buildings float off the ground. Discord continues to taunt Twilight, {{but she is}} determined {{to get back to}} the library in town to find a way to defeat Discord while her best friends' personalities continue to become more warped, losing even more of their color until they are completely monochrome. Managing to get them <b>all</b> <b>into</b> the library, Twilight and Spike locate the book about the Elements of Harmony and after a brief scuffle with the other ponies over the book, are surprised and delighted to find the book actually contains the Elements. She forces her best friends to wear the Elements, though they are more willing to help after she angrily states that the sooner they defeat Discord, the sooner they never have to see each other again; Twilight also assigns Spike as the temporary Element of Loyalty because Rainbow Dash is not present. They go to face Discord, but the Elements fail to activate. The other four ponies and Spike quickly drop the elements and depart, leaving Twilight despondent and finally losing her own color.|$|E

25|$|Media {{across the}} nation began speculating whether the vote was not an {{indication}} of dissatisfaction with the PUP administration; most seemed to think it was.

25|$|The primary {{issue in}} the 2006 {{elections}} was the municipal amalgamation of 2001. Prior to January 1, 2001, the current city of Greater Sudbury consisted of seven separate municipalities, together comprising the Regional Municipality of Sudbury. On that date, the provincial government of Ontario dissolved all seven former municipalities and the regional government, merging them <b>all</b> <b>into</b> the current city government. However, many residents of the outlying communities in the city have alleged that their municipal services have deteriorated significantly since the amalgamation.|$|E

25|$|For {{the wounded}} who were left behind, the Japanese, after mistreating them, massacred all except a handful who escaped. The killed {{included}} {{members of an}} Australian ambulance column. With kicks, clouts and curses, blows from rifle butts and bayonet jabs, their captors crammed them <b>all</b> <b>into</b> a couple of small rooms in a coolie hutment at Parit Sulong village on the Muar highway. The wounded lay piled upon one another's bodies on the floor. They were denied drinking water by the Japanese, who mocked them by bringing bucketfuls of {{it as far as}} the doorway-and then pouring it out upon the ground.|$|E
25|$|In any case, no {{evidence}} has ever proven {{the existence of}} Fräulein Sprengel or her Lodge. (By Westcott's account, {{the other members of}} the German order supposedly objected to Sprengel's chartering of the Isis-Urania Lodge, and all further communications were cut off after she died.) The Isis-Urania Charter was written and signed only by Westcott, Mathers and William Robert Woodman. There are letters by Mackenzie that indicate the 'Society of Eight' existed, but nothing that describes what they actually taught or practiced. The symbolism and philosophy contained in the Cipher Manuscripts are not very different from that of high-degree Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism, and Mackenzie and the members of the S.R.I.A. were capable-enough esoteric scholars, with access to works on the Qabalah, Hermeticism, and Egyptology in Masonic libraries, to have combined it <b>all</b> <b>into</b> the form followed by the Golden Dawn.|$|E
25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water <b>all</b> <b>into</b> my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

500|$|The {{setting of}} Arkham Asylum plays {{a large role}} in how the inmates {{perceive}} their own insanity. As said by the Mad Hatter, [...] "ometimes I think the asylum is the head.

Morrison used hypostasis to push the story forward, saying that the psychoanalytic theory and Jungian archetypes was an influence.|$|E

However, Welles stated that his love for cinema began only when he started the work on the film. When asked where he got the confidence as a first-time director to direct a film so radically different from contemporary cinema, he responded, [...] "Ignorance, ignorance, sheer ignorance—you know there's no confidence to equal it. It's only when you know something about a profession, I think, that you're timid or careful." ...|$|E

It can not or rather does not protect its citizens within its own borders.

[...] "A few of the songs command the attention with the insistence of old… [...] a deliciously wicked ride." [...] AllMusic's Thom Jurek awarded the album {{three and a half}} stars, saying, [...] "In many ways it could be Reign In Blood Revisited… Some compositions on this new recording have more of the band's early–style melody in them, with lightning flare–up riffs between verses: quick unexpected guitar pyrotechnics; and blast beat power drumming from Dave Lombardo pushing it <b>all</b> <b>into</b> red." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{so little}} is known of Bosch's life or intentions, interpretations of his intent have ranged from an admonition of worldly fleshy indulgence, to a dire warning on the perils of life's temptations, to an {{evocation}} of ultimate sexual joy. The intricacy of its symbolism, particularly that of the central panel, {{has led to a}} wide range of scholarly interpretations over the centuries. Twentieth-century art historians are divided as to whether the triptych's central panel is a moral warning or a panorama of paradise lost. Peter S. Beagle describes it as an [...] "erotic derangement that turns us <b>all</b> <b>into</b> voyeurs, a place filled with the intoxicating air of perfect liberty".|$|E
500|$|Colin Jacobson for DVD Movie Guide {{was also}} positive, saying, [...] "'Unbonding' marks a {{demonstrable}} {{improvement over the}} pilot.

In addition, it tosses out just enough humor to make it enjoyable." [...] David Sims of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, saying, [...] "It's a pretty funny episode– my main criticism is just that at this point, Kramer isn't integrated at <b>all</b> <b>into</b> the stories, rather he just comes by and dispenses weird dialog for a couple minutes." ...|$|E

It wasn’t really anything I planned. I wasn’t even ready for this to be a big thing because I’ve had tracks out before. I put my <b>all</b> <b>into</b> everything, but sometimes some tracks come out better than others. It got such a big buzz maybe because it came out the day after and people enjoyed it.” ...|$|E
