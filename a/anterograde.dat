5|$|Additional {{caution is}} {{required}} in the elderly, as they are {{more sensitive to the}} pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines, metabolise them more slowly, and are more prone to adverse effects, including drowsiness, amnesia (especially <b>anterograde</b> amnesia), ataxia, hangover effects, confusion, and falls.|$|E
5|$|Manual {{squeezing}} {{and releasing}} – the examiner can compress the vein below the probe which will push {{the blood in}} its normal <b>anterograde</b> direction. On releasing the pressure if the valves are incompetent the flow will appear as a retrograde flow or reflux, greater than 0.5 sec.|$|E
5|$|The {{black and}} white {{sequences}} begin with Leonard Shelby, an insurance investigator, in a motel room speaking to an unseen and unknown caller. Leonard has <b>anterograde</b> amnesia and is unable to store recent memories, {{the result of an}} attack by two men. Leonard explains that he killed the attacker who raped and strangled his wife, but a second clubbed him and escaped. The police did not accept that there was a second attacker, but Leonard believes the attacker's name is John or James, with a last name starting with G. Leonard conducts his own investigation using a system of notes, Polaroids, and tattoos. From his occupation, Leonard recalls a fellow <b>anterograde</b> amnesiac: Sammy Jankis. Sammy's diabetic wife, who wasn't sure if his condition was genuine, repeatedly requested insulin; she hoped that he would remember having given her an injection and stop himself from giving another before she died of an overdose. However, Sammy continues to administer the injections, and his wife falls into a fatal coma.|$|E
5|$|Normal {{blood flow}} is <b>anterograde</b> (going to the heart), and from {{superficial}} to deep veins via perforator veins. However, {{there are two}} exceptions: firstly, the great saphenous vein (GSV) collaterals, (the veins that run parallel), drain the abdominal wall and have a flow {{from top to bottom}} so that when an examiner tests the sapheno-femoral junction, a false positive diagnosis might be made; secondly, in the flow from the sole of the foot venous network around 10% drains to the dorsal venous arch of the foot, going therefore against the norm, from deep to superficial veins.|$|E
5|$|The {{intermediate}} hippocampus has overlapping characteristics {{with both}} the ventral and dorsal hippocampus. Using <b>anterograde</b> tracing methods, Cenquizca and Swanson (2007) located the moderate projections to two primary olfactory cortical areas and prelimbic areas of the medial prefrontal cortex. This region has the smallest number of place cells. The ventral hippocampus functions in fear conditioning and affective processes. Anagnostaras et al. (2002) showed that alterations to the ventral hippocampus reduced {{the amount of information}} sent to the amygdala by the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, consequently altering fear conditioning in rats.|$|E
5|$|The {{short-term}} use of benzodiazepines adversely affects multiple {{areas of}} cognition, {{the most notable}} one being that it interferes with the formation and consolidation of memories of new material and may induce complete <b>anterograde</b> amnesia. However, researchers hold contrary opinions regarding the effects of long-term administration. One view {{is that many of}} the short-term effects continue into the long-term and may even worsen, and are not resolved after stopping benzodiazepine usage. Another view maintains that cognitive deficits in chronic benzodiazepine users occur only for a short period after the dose, or that the anxiety disorder is the cause of these deficits.|$|E
5|$|Pearce {{stars as}} a man who, {{as a result of}} a past trauma, suffers from <b>anterograde</b> amnesia (the {{inability}} to form new memories) and suffers short-term memory loss approximately every five minutes. He is searching for the persons who attacked him and killed his wife, using an intricate system of Polaroid photographs and tattoos to track information he cannot remember. Memento is presented as two different sequences of scenes interspersed during the film: a series in black-and-white that is shown chronologically, and a series of color sequences shown in reverse order (simulating for the audience the mental state of the protagonist). The two sequences meet at the end of the film, producing one complete and cohesive narrative.|$|E
5|$|While rescuing Sub-Commander T'Pol from {{a spatial}} anomaly, Captain Archer is {{infected}} by subspace parasites in his cerebral cortex, resulting in <b>anterograde</b> amnesia. His condition prevents him from forming new long term memories. This {{allows him to}} remember everything prior to the accident, but any new memories fade within a few hours. It soon becomes clear that Archer is not fit for duty, and he is subsequently relieved of his command. T'Pol is granted a field commission to Captain, but the mission fails and Earth, alongside every other human colony, is destroyed by the Xindi weapon. The few surviving humans form a convoy, led by the Enterprise, which travels to the planet Ceti Alpha V.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam is a short-acting {{benzodiazepine}} {{in adults}} with an elimination half-life of 1.5-2.5 hours. In the elderly, {{as well as}} young children and adolescents, the elimination half-life is longer. Midazolam is metabolised into an active metabolite alpha1-hydroxymidazolam. Age-related deficits, renal and liver status affect the pharmacokinetic factors of midazolam {{as well as its}} active metabolite. However, the active metabolite of midazolam is minor and contributes to only 10 percent of biological activity of midazolam. Midazolam is poorly absorbed orally, with only 50 percent of the drug reaching the bloodstream. Midazolam is metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and by glucuronide conjugation. The therapeutic as well as adverse effects of midazolam are due to its effects on the GABAA receptors; midazolam does not activate GABAA receptors directly but, as with other benzodiazepines, it enhances the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA on the GABAA receptors (↑ frequency of Cl− channel opening) resulting in neural inhibition. Almost all of the properties {{can be explained by the}} actions of benzodiazepines on GABAA receptors. This results in the following pharmacological properties being produced: sedation, induction of sleep, reduction in anxiety, <b>anterograde</b> amnesia, muscle relaxation and anticonvulsant effects.|$|E
5|$|Beer {{contains}} ethyl alcohol, {{the same}} chemical that {{is present in}} wine and distilled spirits and as such, beer consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol {{in the human body}} have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan over which the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, <b>anterograde</b> amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious) and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. As with all alcoholic drinks, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have severe criminal penalties against drunk driving.|$|E
25|$|The memory {{impairment}} that is pathognomonic to Korsakoff's syndrome predominantly {{affects the}} declarative memory, leaving non-declarative memory {{that is often}} procedural in nature relatively intact. The disproportionate severity in <b>anterograde</b> episodic memory processes in contrast to other cognitive processes is what differentiates Korsakoff syndrome from other conditions such as alcohol-related dementia. Evidence {{for the preservation of}} certain memory processes in the presence of severe <b>anterograde</b> episodic memory serve as experimental paradigm to investigate the components of human memory.|$|E
25|$|Electroconvulsive {{therapy in}} which {{seizures}} are electrically induced in patients for therapeutic effect can have acute effects including both retrograde and <b>anterograde</b> amnesia.|$|E
25|$|As {{described}} above, {{patients with}} <b>anterograde</b> amnesia {{have a wide}} range of forgetfulness. Declarative memory can be further subdivided into episodic and semantic memory. Episodic memory is the recollection of autobiographical information with a temporal and/or spatial context, whereas semantic memory involves recall of factual information with no such association (language, history, geography, etc.). In a case study of a girl who developed <b>anterograde</b> amnesia during childhood, it was determined that the patient ("C.L.") retained semantic memory while suffering an extreme impairment of episodic memory.|$|E
25|$|Patients with amnesia {{can learn}} new information, {{particularly}} non-declarative knowledge. However, some patients with dense <b>anterograde</b> amnesia {{do not remember}} the episodes during which they learned or observed the information previously.|$|E
25|$|On occasion, benzodiazepines can induce extreme {{alterations}} in memory such as <b>anterograde</b> amnesia and amnesic automatism, {{which may have}} medico-legal consequences. Such reactions occur usually only at the higher dose end of the prescribing spectrum.|$|E
25|$|A {{limited number}} of cases have been {{described}} in which patients with damage {{to other parts of}} the brain acquired <b>anterograde</b> amnesia. Easton and Parker observed damage to either the hippocampus or the surrounding cortices does not seem to result in severe amnesia in primate models. They suggested damage to the hippocampus and surrounding structures alone does not explain the amnesia they saw in patients, or increasing damage does not correlate with the degree of impairment. Furthermore, the data do not explain the dichotomy that exists in the MTL memory system between episodic and semantic memory. To demonstrate their hypothesis, they used a primate model with damage to the basal forebrain. They proposed that the disruption of neurons that project from the basal forebrain to the MTL are responsible for some of the impairment in <b>anterograde</b> amnesia. Easton and Parker also reported MRI scans of patients with severe <b>anterograde</b> amnesia showed damage beyond to cortical areas around the hippocampus and amygdala (a region of brain involved in emotions) and to surrounding white matter (white matter in the brain consists of axons, long projections of neuronal cell bodies).|$|E
25|$|<b>Anterograde</b> amnesia {{is a loss}} of {{the ability}} to create new {{memories}} after the event that caused the amnesia, leading to a partial or complete inability to recall the recent past, while long-term memories from before the event remain intact. This is in contrast to retrograde amnesia, where memories created prior to the event are lost while new memories can still be created. Both can occur together in the same patient. To a large degree, <b>anterograde</b> amnesia remains a mysterious ailment because the precise mechanism of storing memories is not yet well understood, although it is known that the regions involved are certain sites in the temporal cortex, especially in the hippocampus and nearby subcortical regions.|$|E
25|$|Emotionally arousing stimuli {{can lead}} to {{retrograde}} amnesia for preceding events and <b>anterograde</b> amnesia for subsequent events. This has been demonstrated in lab studies with lists of words or pictures, in which people show impaired memory for stimuli appearing before or after arousing stimuli.|$|E
25|$|Weaknesses: Since {{the amount}} of COPI vesicles varies {{drastically}} among types of cells, this model cannot easily explain high trafficking activity within the Golgi for both small and large cargoes. Additionally, there is no convincing evidence that COPI vesicles move in both the <b>anterograde</b> and retrograde directions.|$|E
25|$|In <b>anterograde</b> embolism, the {{movement}} of emboli is {{in the direction of}} blood flow. In retrograde embolism, however, the emboli move in opposition to the blood flow direction; this is usually significant only in blood vessels with low pressure (veins) or with emboli of high weight.|$|E
25|$|Approaches used {{to treat}} those who suffer from <b>anterograde</b> amnesia often use {{interventions}} which focus on compensatory techniques, such as beepers, written notes, diaries or through intensive training programs involving the active participation of the individual concerned, along with their supporting network of family and friends.|$|E
25|$|Some {{retrograde}} and <b>anterograde</b> amnesics {{are capable}} of non-declarative memory, including implicit learning and procedural learning. For example, some patients show improvement on the pseudorandom sequences experiment as healthy people do. Therefore, procedural learning can proceed independently of the brain system required for declarative memory. According to fMRI studies, the acquisition of procedural memories activates the basal ganglia, the premotor cortex and the supplementary motor area, regions which are not normally associated {{with the formation of}} declarative memories. This type of dissociation between declarative and procedural memory can also be found in patients with diencephalic amnesia such as Korsakoff's syndrome. Another example demonstrated by some patients, such as K.C. and H.M, who have medial temporal damage and <b>anterograde</b> amnesia, still have perceptual priming. Those patients did well in the word fragment completion test.|$|E
25|$|In {{most cases}} of <b>anterograde</b> amnesia, {{patients}} lose declarative memory, or the recollection of facts, but they retain nondeclarative memory, often called procedural memory. For instance, {{they are able}} to remember and in some cases learn how to do things such as talking on the phone or riding a bicycle, but they may not remember what they had eaten earlier that day for lunch. One extensively studied <b>anterograde</b> amnesiac patient, codenamed H.M., demonstrated that despite his amnesia preventing him from learning new declarative information, procedural memory consolidation was still possible, albeit severely reduced in power. He, along with other patients with <b>anterograde</b> amnesia, were given the same maze to complete day after day. Despite having no memory of having completed the maze the day before, unconscious practice of completing the same maze over and over reduced the amount of time needed to complete it in subsequent trials. From these results, Corkin et al. concluded despite having no declarative memory (i.e. no conscious memory of completing the maze exists), the patients still had a working procedural memory (learning done unconsciously through practice). This supports the notion that declarative and procedural memory are consolidated in different areas of the brain. In addition, patients have a diminished ability to remember the temporal context in which objects were presented. Certain authors claim the deficit in temporal context memory is more significant than the deficit in semantic learning ability (described below).|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} {{complication of}} dual-chamber artificial pacemakers is 'pacemaker-mediated tachycardia' (PMT), {{a form of}} reentrant tachycardia. In PMT, the artificial pacemaker forms the <b>anterograde</b> (atrium to ventricle) limb of the circuit and the atrioventricular (AV) node forms the retrograde limb (ventricle to atrium) of the circuit. Treatment of PMT typically involves reprogramming the pacemaker.|$|E
25|$|This {{model is}} an {{extension}} of the cisternal progression/maturation model. It incorporates the existence of tubular connections among the cisternae that form the Golgi ribbon, in which cisternae within a stack are linked. This model posits that the tubules are important for bidirectional traffic in the ER-Golgi system: they allow for fast <b>anterograde</b> traffic of small cargo and/or the retrograde traffic of native Golgi proteins.|$|E
25|$|If an individual's delta waves {{disappear}} with {{increases in}} the heart rate, {{he or she is}} considered to be at lower risk of SCD. This is because the loss of the delta wave shows that the accessory pathway cannot conduct electrical impulses at a high rate (in the <b>anterograde</b> direction). These individuals typically do not have fast conduction down the accessory pathway during episodes of atrial fibrillation.|$|E
25|$|In an aortic dissection, blood penetrates the intima {{and enters}} the media layer. The high {{pressure}} rips the tissue of the media apart along the laminated plane splitting the inner two-thirds and the outer one-third of the media apart. This can propagate {{along the length of}} the aorta for a variable distance forward or backwards. Dissections that propagate towards the iliac bifurcation (with the flow of blood) are called <b>anterograde</b> dissections and those that propagate towards the aortic root (opposite of the flow of blood) are called retrograde dissections. The initial tear is usually within 100mm of the aortic valve, so a retrograde dissection can easily compromise the pericardium leading to a hemopericardium. <b>Anterograde</b> dissections may propagate all the way to the iliac bifurcation of the aorta, rupture the aortic wall, or recanalize into the intravascular lumen leading to a double-barrel aorta. The double-barrel aorta relieves the pressure of blood flow and reduces the risk of rupture. Rupture leads to hemorrhaging into a body cavity, and prognosis depends on the area of rupture. Retroperitoneal and pericardial ruptures are both possible.|$|E
25|$|Acetylcholine {{has been}} implicated in {{learning}} and memory in several ways. The anticholinergic drug, scopolamine, impairs acquisition of new information in humans and animals. In animals, disruption of the supply of acetylcholine to the neocortex impairs the learning of simple discrimination tasks, comparable to the acquisition of factual information and disruption of the supply of acetylcholine to the hippocampus and adjacent cortical areas produces forgetting comparable to <b>anterograde</b> amnesia in humans.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{cognitive}} abilities, one study {{has shown that}} morphine may {{have a negative impact}} on <b>anterograde</b> and retrograde memory, but these effects are minimal and transient. Overall, it seems that acute doses of opioids in non-tolerant subjects produce minor effects in some sensory and motor abilities, and perhaps also in attention and cognition. It is likely that the effects of morphine will be more pronounced in opioid-naive subjects than chronic opioid users.|$|E
25|$|In this model, the Golgi {{is viewed}} as a set of stable {{compartments}} that work together. Each compartment has a unique collection of enzymes that work to modify protein cargo. Proteins are delivered from the ER to the cis face using COPII-coated vesicles. Cargo then progress toward the trans face in COPI-coated vesicles. This model proposes that COPI vesicles move in two directions: <b>anterograde</b> vesicles carry secretory proteins, while retrograde vesicles recycle Golgi-specific trafficking proteins.|$|E
25|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of <b>anterograde</b> amnesic syndromes {{varies with}} the extent of damage and the regions {{of the brain that}} were damaged. The most well-described regions indicated in this disorder are the medial temporal lobe (MTL), basal forebrain, and fornix. Beyond the details described below, the precise process of how we remember– on a micro scale– remains a mystery. Neuropsychologists and scientists are still not in total agreement over whether forgetting is due to faulty encoding, accelerated forgetting, or faulty retrieval, although a great deal of data seem to point to the encoding hypothesis. In addition, neuroscientists are also in disagreement about the length of time involved in memory consolidation. Though most researchers, including Hasselmo et al., have found the consolidation process is spread out over several hours before transitioning from a fragile to a more permanent state, others, including Brown et al., posit that memory consolidation can take months or even years in a drawn-out process of consolidation and reinforcement. Further research into the length of time of memory consolidation will shed more light on why <b>anterograde</b> amnesia sometimes affects some memories gained after the event(s) that caused the amnesia, but does not affect other such memories.|$|E
25|$|In animal models, {{researchers}} have shown monkeys with damage {{to both the}} hippocampus and its adjacent cortical regions were more severely impaired in terms of <b>anterograde</b> amnesia than monkeys with damage localized to hippocampal structures. However, conflicting data in another primate study point to the observation {{that the amount of}} tissue damaged does not necessarily correlate with the severity of the memory loss. Furthermore, the data do not explain the dichotomy that exists in the MTL memory system between episodic memory and semantic memory (described below).|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{effects of}} benzodiazepines such as {{diazepam}} include <b>anterograde</b> amnesia and confusion (especially pronounced in higher doses) and sedation. The elderly {{are more prone}} to adverse effects of diazepam, such as confusion, amnesia, ataxia, and hangover effects, as well as falls. Long-term use of benzodiazepines such as diazepam is associated with drug tolerance, benzodiazepine dependence, and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Like other benzodiazepines, diazepam can impair short-term memory and learning of new information. While benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam can cause <b>anterograde</b> amnesia, they do not cause retrograde amnesia; information learned before using benzodiazepines is not impaired. Tolerance to the cognitive-impairing effects of benzodiazepines does not tend to develop with long-term use, and the elderly are more sensitive to them. Additionally, after cessation of benzodiazepines, cognitive deficits may persist for at least six months; it is unclear whether these impairments take longer than six months to abate or if they are permanent. Benzodiazepines may also cause or worsen depression. Infusions or repeated intravenous injections of diazepam when managing seizures, for example, may lead to drug toxicity, including respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. Drug tolerance may also develop to infusions of diazepam if it is given for longer than 24 hours. Adverse effects such as sedation, benzodiazepine dependence, and abuse potential limit the use of benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Some {{symptoms}} of amnesia {{have been shown}} to be alleviated through various interactions with music, including playing and listening. One such case is that of Clive Wearing, whose severe retrograde and <b>anterograde</b> amnesia have been detailed in the documentaries Prisoner of Consciousness and The Man with the 7 Second Memory. Though unable to recall past memories or form new ones, Wearing is still able to play, conduct, and sing along with music learned prior to the onset of his amnesia, and even add improvisations and flourishes.|$|E
25|$|MTL amnesic {{patients}} with localized {{damage to the}} hippocampus retain other perceptual abilities, {{such as the ability}} to intelligently function in society, to make conversation, to make one's bed, etc. Additionally, <b>anterograde</b> amnesics without combined retrograde disorders (localized damage to the MTL system) have memories prior to the traumatic event. For this reason, the MTL is not the storage place of all memories; other regions in the brain also store memories. The key is the MTL is responsible for the learning of new materials.|$|E
25|$|Christopher Nolan's {{psychological}} crime film Memento (2000) {{contains a}} distinguished depiction of <b>anterograde</b> amnesia, {{in that the}} character Leonard Shelby is trying to identify and kill the man who raped and murdered his wife, and does so through a system of writing crucial details related to the search on his body and on the blank spaces of Polaroid photographs. Mental health experts have described Memento {{as one of the}} most accurate depictions of amnesia in film history, an accuracy that was enhanced by the film's fragmented, non-linear structure that mimics the protagonist's memory problems.|$|E
