5|$|A small Swedish {{reinforcement}} force {{arrived in}} Trondheim, but both food and ammunition were in short supply. On October 4, the Norwegian forces {{arrived at the}} city reinforced by 1,000 peasants from the surrounding countryside who had taken up arms. When hearing that aid was near, {{the population of the}} city revolted, but the uprising within Trondheim was quickly suppressed. Charles X ordered Lieutenant Colonel Erik Drakenberg to assemble <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>in</b> Jämtland and march towards Trondheim, but the relief was stopped by Norwegian peasants that had taken to the hills and defended the mountain passages.|$|E

After {{the men had}} recovered, they {{appeared}} {{before a grand jury}} to respond to any charges brought against them. They were exonerated and, afterward, went to Hindman's parents' house in Mississippi. Hindman received praise for his actions and became <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>in</b> Democratic politics after the Know-Nothings were defeated.|$|E
5|$|From 2009, the Swedish economy {{emerged as}} one of the world's fastest {{recovering}} economies with high competitiveness. Sweden was noted for having proved to overcome the crisis better than any other developed countries, and this was highlighted by the Government as <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>in</b> the run-up to 2010 general election. As Sweden emerged as the best country on several areas after the financial crisis it brought a resurgence of support, which eventually resulted in his re-election in 2010. This was the first time ever that the Moderate Party was re-eleted after completing a full first term.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the global well-posedness for the Camassa-Holm(C-H) {{equation}} with <b>a</b> <b>forcing</b> <b>in</b> H^ 1 (R) by the characteristic method. Due to the forcing, many important properties {{to study the}} well posedness of weak solutions do not inherit from the C-H equation without <b>a</b> <b>forcing,</b> such as conservation laws, integrability. By exploiting the balance law and some new estimates, we prove the existence and uniqueness of global weak solutions for the C-H equation with <b>a</b> <b>forcing</b> <b>in</b> H^ 1 (R).

5|$|On {{his return}} voyage, he visited Palestine for 12 days {{in what would}} become his only visit to that region. He was greeted {{as if he were}} a head of state, rather than a physicist, which {{included}} a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the British high commissioner, Sir Herbert Samuel. During one reception, the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him. In Einstein's talk to the audience, he expressed happiness that the Jewish people were beginning to be recognized as <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>in</b> the world.|$|E

5|$|The {{return of}} Australian {{personnel}} from the SWPA was delayed by shipping shortages {{and the need}} to maintain <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>in</b> the area for garrison duties. The military provided these personnel with training courses to prepare them for civilian life. Refresher courses in basic subjects such as maths and English were run first before vocational training began. The teachers and instructors for these courses were service personnel {{selected on the basis of}} their civilian occupations. In addition, sport competitions were conducted to keep the men busy.|$|E
5|$|In 1444 {{the major}} princes of the Albanian Principalities, which {{up to that}} point had been vassals of the Ottoman Empire, united and formed the League of Lezhë, an anti-Ottoman confederacy under Skanderbeg's lead. As a result, the Ottoman Empire sought to crush the League and re-establish control over Albania. As of 1448, all Ottoman expeditions into Albania had failed and Murad II chose lead <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>in</b> person into Albanian {{territory}} and fragment the League. The sultan decided to capture the fortress of Svetigrad. This fortress served the strategic purpose of protecting the Albanian eastern frontier, while also allowing the Albanians to launch their own assaults on Ottoman territory. In late 1447, war began between Venice and the League, but had not yet escalated into full-scale conflict. Skanderbeg had declared war on Venice {{as a result of a}} diplomatic impasse. This left him open to invasion from the East.|$|E
5|$|Mary was {{the only}} child of Henry VIII by his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, to survive to adulthood. Her younger {{half-brother}} Edward VI (son of Henry and Jane Seymour) succeeded their father in 1547 at the age of nine. When Edward became mortally ill in 1553, he attempted to remove Mary from the line of succession because he opposed her Catholicism. On his death, leading politicians tried to proclaim Lady Jane Grey as queen. Mary assembled <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>in</b> East Anglia and deposed Jane, who was ultimately beheaded. Mary was—excluding the disputed reigns of Jane and the Empress Matilda—the first queen regnant of England. In 1554, Mary married Philip of Spain, becoming queen consort of Habsburg Spain on his accession in 1556, but she never visited Spain.|$|E

5|$|One of Dellinger's assistants, {{hired in}} 1975, Tom Heinonen, was {{promoted}} to the head coach for the women's cross country and track and field team in 1977. Prior to Heinonen, no other full-time head coach at Oregon had exclusively coached the women's disciplines. He was a strong advocate for women's sports and was <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>in</b> making the Oregon Twilight Meet a co-ed event. Women's cross country and track and field blossomed under Heinonen's leadership. He led the women's team to win its first three NCAA team championships and coached 14 NCAA individual champions. He produced 134 All-Americans and his athletes made 17 appearances in the Olympics. He retired in 2003, after which the University of Oregon Athletic Department decided to combine the men's and women's programs under one head coach.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} couple of days volunteers arrived in Lyme {{offering}} to serve under Monmouth. By 15 June he had <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>in</b> excess of 1,000 men. On 13 June he lost two of his leading supporters when Dare and Fletcher disputed who should ride one of the best horses provided by local supporters. Fletcher shot and killed Dare and was then put under arrest and sent back to the frigate Helderenberg. The next day, 40 cavalry and 400foot soldiers, under the command of Lord Grey and Wade, moved on to the nearby town of Bridport, where they encountered 1,200 men from the local royalist Dorset militia. The skirmish ended with the retreat of Grey and the cavalry followed by Wade with the foot soldiers. Many of the militiamen deserted and joined Monmouth's army. Following this confrontation, Lord Albermarle led a royalist force from Exeter towards the forces of the Duke of Somerset, who were approaching Lyme Regis from the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|Patton did not command <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>in</b> combat for 11 months. In September, Bradley, who was Patton's {{junior in}} both rank and experience, was {{selected}} to command the First United States Army forming in England to prepare for Operation Overlord. This decision had been made before the slapping incidents were made public, but Patton blamed them for his being denied the command. Eisenhower felt the invasion of Europe was too important to risk any uncertainty, and that the slapping incidents had been an example of Patton's inability to exercise discipline and self-control. While Eisenhower and Marshall both considered Patton to be a skilled combat commander, they felt Bradley was less impulsive or prone to making mistakes. On January 26, 1944 Patton was formally given command of the Third United States Army in England, a newly arrived unit, and assigned to prepare its inexperienced soldiers for combat in Europe. This duty kept Patton busy in early 1944 preparing for the pending invasion.|$|E

5|$|The Macdonalds {{initially}} {{lived with}} another family, but then resided over a store which Hugh Macdonald ran. Soon after their arrival, John's younger brother James {{died from a}} blow to the head by a servant who was supposed to look after the boys. After Hugh's store failed, the family moved to Hay Bay (south of Napanee, Ontario), west of Kingston, where Hugh unsuccessfully ran another shop. His father, in 1829, was appointed a magistrate for the Midland District. John Macdonald's mother was a lifelong influence on her son, helping him in his difficult first marriage and remaining <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>in</b> his life until her 1862 death.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} in the Adriatic has been credited with having {{a significant effect on}} the wider war through the disruption of French forces in the Balkans. It has been suggested that Napoleon intended to invade the Ottoman Empire following the War of the Fifth Coalition, but was dissuaded in part due to the difficulty of supplying <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>in</b> the region without control of the Adriatic, his attention eventually turning to Russia. The campaign also had effects on the morale and effectiveness of the French fleet, which lost some of its best commanders and frigates in the campaign, and on the Austrian advance on Italy in 1813, when French defence lines were repeatedly out-flanked by British attacks from the sea.|$|E
5|$|Though the League for Social Reconstruction {{began as}} more of a {{discussion}} group than a political party, it became <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>in</b> Canadian politics by the mid-1930s. After Havelock joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, along with several other members of the League, he was pressured by his superiors at the University to curtail his political activity. He did not, continuing to act as an ally and occasional spokesman for Underhill and other leftist professors. He found himself in trouble again in 1937 after criticising both the government's and industry's handling of an automotive workers' strike. Despite calls from Ontario officials for his ouster, he was able to remain at Victoria College, but his public reputation was badly damaged.|$|E

5|$|In 1640 Charles {{attempted}} {{again to}} enforce his authority, opening a second Bishops' War. He recalled the English Parliament, {{known as the}} Short Parliament, but disbanded it after it declined to vote a new subsidy and was critical of his policies. He assembled a poorly provisioned and poorly trained army. The Scots moved south into England, forcing a crossing of the Tyne at Newburn {{to the west of}} Newcastle-upon-Tyne, then occupying the city and eventually most of Northumbria and Durham. This gave them a stranglehold on the vital coal supply to London. Charles was forced to capitulate, agreeing to most of the Covenanter's demands and paying them £830 a month to support their army. This forced him to recall the English Parliament, known as the Long Parliament, which, in exchange for concessions, raised the sum of £200,000 to be paid to the Scots under the Treaty of Ripon. The Scots army returned home triumphant. The king's attempts to raise <b>a</b> <b>force</b> <b>in</b> Ireland to invade Scotland from the west prompted a widespread revolt there and as the English moved to outright opposition that resulted in the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, he was facing rebellion in all three of his realms.|$|E
