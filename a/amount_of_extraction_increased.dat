40|$|BackgroundRecent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the cyclical nature of mouse lactation can be mirrored at the transcriptome level of the mammary glands but making sense of microarray results requires analysis <b>of</b> large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> biological information which is increasingly difficult to access as the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> literature <b>increases.</b> <b>Extraction</b> <b>of</b> protein-protein interaction from text by statistical and natural language processing has shown to be useful in managing the literature. Correlations between gene expression across a series of samples is a simple method to analyze microarray data as it was found that genes that are related in functions exhibit similar expression profiles. Microarrays had been used to examine the transcriptome of mouse lactation and found that the cyclic nature of the lactation cycle as observed histologically is reflected at the transcription level. However, there has been no study to date using text mining to sieve microarray analysis to generate new hypotheses for further research in the field of lactational biology. ResultsOur results demonstrated that a previously reported protein name co-occurrence method (5 -mention PubGene) which was not based on a hypothesis testing framework, it is generally statistically more significant than the 99 th percentile of Poisson distribution-based method of calculating co-occurrence. It agrees with previous methods using natural language processing to extract protein-protein interaction from text as more than 96 % of the interactions found by natural language processing methods to overlap with the results from 5 -mention PubGene method. However, less than 2 % of the gene co-expressions analyzed by microarray were found from direct co-occurrence or interaction information extraction from the literature. At the same time, combining microarray and literature analyses, we derive a novel set of 7 potential functional protein-protein interactions that had not been previously described in the literature. ConclusionsWe conclude that the 5 -mention PubGene method is more stringent than the 99 th percentile of Poisson distribution method for extracting protein-protein interactions by co-occurrence of entity names and literature analysis may be a potential filter for microarray analysis to isolate potentially novel hypotheses for further research...|$|R

Requir-ing a very small <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>extraction</b> solvents, MEPS is an environment-friendly technique. LC separationwith UV detection was used as the analytical technique because it is simple, robust, relatively economicand easy-to-find in most laboratories. The method was validated in terms of precision, accuracy andrecovery. Limits of detection and quantitation were in the range of 0. 5 – 2 ng/L. Linearity (R 2) spannedfrom 0. 9994 and 1. 0000. Intra- and inter-day repeatabilities were lower than 12 % at any concentration. Recovery percentages of an equivalent-to-real sample at three different concentrations were between 70. 7 and 74. 1 %...|$|R
