5|$|Under certain conditions, protons can {{re-enter}} the mitochondrial matrix without {{contributing to}} ATP synthesis. This process {{is known as}} proton leak or mitochondrial uncoupling and {{is due to the}} facilitated diffusion of protons into the matrix. The process results in the unharnessed potential energy of the proton electrochemical gradient being released as heat. The process is mediated by a proton channel called thermogenin, or UCP1. Thermogenin is a 33 kDa protein first discovered in 1973. Thermogenin is primarily found in brown <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue,</b> or brown fat, and is responsible for non-shivering thermogenesis. Brown <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> is found in mammals, and is at its highest levels in early life and in hibernating animals. In humans, brown <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> is present at birth and decreases with age.|$|E
5|$|Not all inhibitors of {{oxidative}} phosphorylation are toxins. In brown <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue,</b> regulated proton channels called uncoupling proteins can uncouple respiration from ATP synthesis. This rapid respiration produces heat, and {{is particularly important}} {{as a way of}} maintaining body temperature for hibernating animals, although these proteins may also have a more general function in cells' responses to stress.|$|E
50|$|Glyceroneogenesis in {{liver and}} <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> {{regulate}} lipid metabolism in opposite ways. On one hand, lipids {{in the form}} of triglycerides are released from the liver. However, on the other hand, glyceroneogenesis restrains the fatty acid release from <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> by re-esterifying them. In other words, glyceroneogenesis in liver and <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> are alternately regulated. When the lipid concentration in the blood is relatively high, glyceroneogenesis in liver will negatively regulated to stop the synthesis of triglyceride, but glyceroneogenesis in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> will be induced in order to restrain the release of free fatty acid to the bloodstream. Conversely, glyceroneogenesis in liver will be induced and suppressed in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> when lipid level of the blood is low. Even though the reciprocal regulation of glyceroneogenesis is not well understood, a hormone called glucocorticoid is a best example of the regulation. Glucocorticoids induce gene transcription of PEPC-K in liver but repress the transcription in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues.</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the ameliorative effect of gallic acid (GA) on hypertriglyceridemia and fat accumulation in perirenal <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> of high-fructose diet (HFD) -induced diabetic rats. The previous results showed that orally administered GA (30 mg/kg body weight) for four weeks significantly reduced the levels of plasma glucose and triglyceride (TG) in HFD rats. GA also markedly decreased the perirenal <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> weight of HFD rats in present study (p < 0. 05). Western blot assay indicated that GA restored expression of insulin signaling-related proteins, such as insulin receptor (IR), protein kinase C-zeta (PKC-ζ), and glucose transporter- 4 (GLUT 4) in the perirenal <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> of HFD rats. Moreover, GA enhanced expression of glycolysis-related proteins, such as phosphofructokinase (PFK) and pyruvate kinase (PK), and increased the expression of lipolysis-related proteins, such as adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), which is involved in lipolysis in the perirenal <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> of HFD rats. This study revealed that GA may alleviate hypertriglyceridemia and fat accumulation through enhancing glycolysis and lipolysis pathways in perirenal <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> of HFD rats. These findings also suggest the potential of GA in preventing the progression of diabetes mellitus (DM) complications...|$|R
40|$|STAMP 2 is a counterregulator of {{inflammation}} and insulin resistance. The {{aim of this}} study is to investigate whether activation of STAMP 2 improves insulin resistance by regulating macrophage polarization in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues.</b> The diabetic ApoE⁻/⁻/LDLR⁻/⁻ mouse model was induced by high-fat diet and low-dose streptozotocin. Samples were obtained from epididymal, subcutaneous and brown <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues.</b> Infiltration of M 1 /M 2 macrophages and inflammatory cytokines were investigated by immunohistochemistry. We then used gene overexpression to investigate the effect of STAMP 2 on macrophages infiltration and polarization and inflammatory cytokines expression. Our results showed that infiltration of macrophages, the ratio of M 1 /M 2 macrophages and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines were enhanced and STAMP 2 was downregulated in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> of diabetic ApoE⁻/⁻/LDLR⁻/⁻ mice compared with control mice. STAMP 2 gene overexpression could significantly reduce macrophages infiltration, the ratio of M 1 /M 2 macrophages and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in epididymal and brown <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues,</b> improving insulin resistance. Our results suggested that STAMP 2 gene overexpression may improve insulin resistance via regulating macrophage polarization in visceral and brown <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues...</b>|$|R
5|$|Amphibians {{possess a}} pancreas, liver and gall bladder. The liver is usually large with two lobes.

5|$|The blunted {{ventilatory}} {{response is}} attributed to several factors. Obese people tend to have raised levels of the hormone leptin, which is secreted by <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> and under normal circumstances increases ventilation. In OHS, this effect is reduced. Furthermore, episodes of nighttime acidosis (e.g. due to sleep apnea) lead to compensation by the kidneys with retention of the alkali bicarbonate. This normalizes the acidity of the blood. However, bicarbonate stays around in the bloodstream for longer, and further episodes of hypercapnia lead to relatively mild acidosis and reduced ventilatory response in a vicious circle.|$|E

CTRP 1 is expressed at high levels in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> of LPS-stimulated Sprague-Dawley rats. The LPS-induced increase in CTRP 1 gene expression was found to be mediated by TNF-α and IL- 1 β. Also, a high level of expression of CTRP 1 mRNA was observed in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> of Zucker diabetic fatty (fa/fa) rats, compared to Sprague-Dawley rats in the absence of LPS stimulation.

5|$|Triglycerides, {{stored in}} <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue,</b> {{are a major}} form of energy storage both in animals and plants. The adipocyte, or fat cell, is {{designed}} for continuous synthesis and breakdown of triglycerides in animals, with breakdown controlled mainly by the activation of hormone-sensitive enzyme lipase. The complete oxidation of fatty acids provides high caloric content, about 9kcal/g, compared with 4kcal/g for the breakdown of carbohydrates and proteins. Migratory birds that must fly long distances without eating use stored energy of triglycerides to fuel their flights.|$|E
5|$|Connective tissues are fibrous {{and made}} up of cells {{scattered}} among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. The main types are loose connective tissue, <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue,</b> fibrous connective tissue, cartilage and bone. The extracellular matrix contains proteins, the chief and most abundant of which is collagen. Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body. An exoskeleton is a thickened, rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization, as in crustaceans or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in insects. An endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals, {{as well as in}} many of those less developed.|$|E

We used RNA-seq technique to investigate the transcriptomes in 3 <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> of omental (O), subcutaneous (S) and intramuscular (I) fats in cattle. Sequence reads were obtained from Illumina HiSeq 2000 and mapped to the bovine genome using Tophat 2.

Depot specifically up- and down- regulated DEGs were 853 in S, 48 in I, and 979 in O. The numbers of DEGs and functional annotation studies suggested that I had the different genetic profile compared to other two <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues.</b> In I, DEGs involved in the developmental process (eg.

5|$|Most of {{the risk}} factors for endometrial cancer involve high levels of estrogens. An {{estimated}} 40% of cases {{are thought to be}} related to obesity. In obesity, the excess of <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> increases conversion of androstenedione into estrone, an estrogen. Higher levels of estrone in the blood causes less or no ovulation and exposes the endometrium to continuously high levels of estrogens. Obesity also causes less estrogen to be removed from the blood. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which also causes irregular or no ovulation, is associated with higher rates of endometrial cancer for the same reasons as obesity. Specifically, obesity, typeII diabetes, and insulin resistance are risk factors for TypeI endometrial cancer. Obesity increases the risk for endometrial cancer by 300–400%.|$|E
25|$|Fatty Tissue. In Biology, <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> (/ˈædəˌpoʊs/) or {{body fat}} or fat depot or just fat is loose {{connective}} tissue composed of adipocytes. It is technically composed of roughly only 80% fat; fat in its solitary state {{exists in the}} liver and muscles. <b>Adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> is derived from lipoblasts. Its main role is to store {{energy in the form}} of lipids, although it also cushions and insulates the body. Far from hormonally inert, <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> has in recent years been recognized as a major endocrine organ, as it produces hormones such as leptin, resistin, and the cytokine TNFα. Moreover, <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> can affect other organ systems of the body and may lead to disease. Obesity or being overweight in humans and most animals does not depend on body weight but on the amount of body fat—to be specific, <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue.</b> Two types of <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> exist: white <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> (WAT) and brown <b>adipose</b> <b>tissue</b> (BAT).

Forty-eight animals with the gender ratio of 1 : 1 for both Guangling Large Tailed (GLT) and Small Tailed Han (STH) sheep were slaughtered at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months of age, respectively. <b>Adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> were collected from greater and lesser omental, subcutaneous, retroperitoneal, perirenal, mesenteric, and tail fats.

The results showed that ANGPTL 4 mRNA expressed in all <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> studied with the highest in subcutaneous and the lowest in mesenteric fat depots.

40|$|The tissue-specific {{response}} to rumen-protected {{conjugated linoleic acid}} supply (rpCLA) of liver, two muscles, and three <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> of heavy lambs was studied. Twenty-four lambs, 8 months old, divided into 4 groups of 6, were fed at libitum on a ration supplemented without or {{with a mixture of}} rpCLA. Silica and hydrogenated soybean oil was the rpCLA coating matrix. The lambs were slaughtered at 11 months of age. Tissues were collected and analyzed for their FA profiles. The dietary rpCLA supplement had no influence on carcass fatness nor on the fat content of the liver and tissues and had little influence on the FA profiles of these <b>tissues.</b> In the <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues,</b> rpCLA increased the proportions of saturated FAs, 18 : 0 and 18 : 2 t 10 c 12, and decreased the proportions of monounsaturated FAs in the <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues.</b> In muscles, the effects were the opposite.

Concentrations of PBDEs (1. 5 – 27 ng/g lipid wt) and HBCDs (0. 85 – 39 ng/g lipid wt) in <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> were 1 – 2 orders of magnitude {{lower than those of}} organochlorines (OCs). However, observed PBDE levels in this study were relatively higher than those in Japanese human <b>adipose</b> <b>tissues</b> reported previously in the samples collected during the year 2000, while OC levels were comparable to those in specimens reported by our group in the samples collected during 1999. No age-dependent accumulation of PBDEs and HBCDs was observed, while OC levels except chlordane compounds increased with age. These results indicate recent human exposure to PBDEs and HBCDs in Japan. This is the first report on HBCDs in Japanese human tissue.
