40|$|The {{development}} {{of the theory of}} library classification and of subject indexing, for the organisation, storage and retrieval of subjects embodied in documents has a striking parallelism to the search for 'universal forms ' and deep structure'ln language and linguistic studies. The significant contributions of the theories of classification and subject indexing are the subject analysis techniques of Ranganathan and Bhattacharyya's POPSI. A computer based system, for generating an information retrieval thesaurus, from modulated subject-proposltlons, formulated according to the subject analysis techniques, enriched with certain codes for relating the terms in the subject-proposltlons has been developed. The system generates hierarchlc, associative, coordinate and synonymous relationships between terms and presents them as an <b>alphabetical</b> <b>thesaurus.</b> Also, once a thesaurus is generated in one language it is possible to produce the same thesaurus in different languages by Just forming a table of equivalent terms in the required language.

40|$|Abstract. The main aim of {{this project}} is to {{investigate}} and identify the pillars of Knowledge Architecture {{in the field of}} Cultural Heritage. This will be carried out through the construction of a specialised Portal and a multilingual thesaurus for the social and educational dissemination of cultural, historic and natural heritage. We study cultural heritage and how it’s managed from a multidisciplinary point of view, employing the methods and procedures used in the human and social sciences, information technology and library science together with documentation. The research team will design the Dihèlia portal and the thesaurus {{through the use of a}} wide range of procedural activities. To achieve this, the information shall be organised on the basis of a multilingual taxonomy, involving an analysis of scientific production, the primary sources and information resources of the team’s researchers, the scientific community and any available resources that can be found on the Internet. In this way, we will design 5 databases (projects, resources and the culture of information, researchers, scientific production and cultural industries). We will work on the thematic areas of the realms of heritage through the use of 40 concept maps so as to construct the hierarchical thesaurus and the <b>alphabetical</b> <b>thesaurus</b> for information retrieval, which will be multilingual (Catalan, Spanish, English and French). The information system, which will be located on the website of the Scientific Park of Barcelona (URL...|$|E
