5|$|During a {{party at}} the {{community}} centre, Fatboy smuggles in alcohol and kisses Denise Fox (Diane Parish), angering her husband Lucas (Don Gilet), who throws Fatboy out and begins angrily preaching to him. This causes Fatboy to argue with Mercy. During the argument, Mercy pushes him and he falls onto a tree in the Square's gardens planted in memory of Lucas's ex-wife Trina (Sharon Duncan Brewster), snapping it. Fatboy enlists the help of Mercy, Leon and ZsaZsa to replace it, but as they dig it up, they uncover a dead body, that of Denise's ex-husband Owen Turner (Lee Ross), who Lucas murdered eight months previously. The next day, Fatboy comforts Mercy and to cheer her up, they play rounders. However, they smash Dot Branning's (June Brown) window and she makes Fatboy fix it. He does <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>job</b> so she insists he pay for a professional, asking Fatboy to wait in her house for the professional to arrive. While he waits, he plays dominoes with Dot's husband Jim (John Bardon) and when Dot returns, she is impressed with Fatboy's politeness when he offers to clean the new window and make her a cup of tea.|$|E
500|$|Steve Young, {{a writer}} for the Late Show with David Letterman, was brought in as a {{freelance}} writer to write the episode. The writers wanted to explore what made Flanders tick and examine what made him act the way he does. The original idea came from George Meyer, who had also wanted an episode about Flanders' faith being tested. One of the key story points came from his friend Jack Handey, {{a writer for}} Saturday Night Live, who wanted to do a sketch about a down-on-his-luck shoemaker who is visited by elves who help him, but make very bad shoes. Likewise, it inspired the idea that the neighbors would rebuild Flanders' house, but do <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>job</b> and provoke an outburst.|$|E
500|$|Eventually Butler's {{leadership}} {{style and the}} directness of actions undermined his support within the community. His departure seemed imminent. Mayor Kendrick reported to the press, [...] "I {{had the guts to}} bring General Butler to Philadelphia and I have the guts to fire him." [...] Feeling that his duties in Philadelphia were coming to an end, Butler contacted General Lejeune to prepare for his return to the Marine Corps. Not all of the city felt he was doing <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>job,</b> though, and when the news started to break that he would be leaving, people began to gather at the Academy of Music. A group of 4,000 supporters assembled and negotiated a truce between him and the mayor to keep him in Philadelphia for a while longer, and the president authorized a one-year extension.|$|E

500|$|After {{establishing}} {{a friendship with}} recording artist Miley Cyrus in 2013, Gregory E. Miller from the New York Post noted that the media and general public would continue [...] "following her every move". Ferreira commented that [...] " [...] obviously way bigger and all eyes [...] on her, but I feel like we're kind of going through a similar thing where everyone's {{trying to say that}} we're trying to make ourselves objects, but really, everyone else is making it more like that—sensationalizing sex and reading into things. It's nice to have someone that gets it." [...] Ferreira had also generated a minor controversy after appearing topless on the cover for Night Time, My Time, to which she responded [...] "there's nothing about that photo that's pornographic; we came on this earth nude."

500|$|Staci Layne Wilson of Horror.com {{also felt}} {{the film was}} full of stereotypes, {{including}} a [...] "stupid circus trainer; bible-thumping naysayer; the great white hunter; small-minded mayor; pinheaded press; wise Indian sage; [...] military sorts" [...] but felt they were depicted in such an extreme manner that they were simply boring. She found the films conclusion to be predictable and [...] "corny". She did praise the film's cinematography and visual appeal despite {{the limited number of}} filming locations actually used. In reviewing the film for DVD Talk, film instructor and critic Justin Felix found the use of a real tiger one of the only original elements of the film, while feeling the plot, setting, and characters followed the set Sci Fi Channel movie of the week formula. At the same time, he notes that the use of a live tiger results in most attacks occurring off screen and the tiger being rarely seen at all, taking away the [...] "usual" [...] fun of laughing at badly done [...] "CG terrors." [...] Monsters and Critics.coms Jeff Swindoll felt the film was a poor attempt at replicating Jaws with the tiger taking on the role of a [...] "land shark." [...] While he felt the character of Colonel Graham was contrived and seemed to come from another era, Swindoll did think Ian D. Clark did portray the character decently. Like other critics, Swindoll praised the use of a live tiger, but also notes that it was obvious the tiger was playing with the actors like a [...] "sweet pussycat" [...] and that the post-production editing did <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>job</b> of trying {{to make it look like}} the tiger was a vicious killer.|$|E

50|$|When the {{national}} Democratic Party previously took positions on Civil Rights viewed too radical, Mississippi’s white population’s extreme traditional hostility to the Republican Party caused the Magnolia State to elect “states’ rights” Democrats and unpledged Democratic electors in 1948 and 1960 respectively. Despite their hostility to the “Republican” label in the past, Goldwater’s support for “constitutional government and local self-rule” {{meant that the}} absence from the ballot of such third parties mattered little. The Arizona Senator {{had been one of}} only six Republicans to vote against the Civil Rights Act, and Goldwater’s staunchly conservative policies, which alienated the traditional Northeastern Republican heartland to the point of completely abandoning the GOP, were adequate for the small Mississippi electorate to almost unanimously support him over the “big government” Johnson.

500|$|Robbins himself {{believes}} {{that the concept of}} Zihuatanejo resonates with audiences because it represents a form of escape that can be achieved after surviving for many years within whatever [...] "jail" [...] someone finds themselves, from <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> relationship, <b>job,</b> or environment. Robbins said that it is important that such a place exists for us. Isaac M. Morehouse suggests that the film provides a great illustration of how characters can be free, even in prison, or unfree, even in freedom, based on their outlooks on life. Philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre described freedom as an ongoing project that requires attention and resilience, without which a person begins to be defined by others or institutions, mirroring Red's belief that inmates become dependent on the prison to define their lives. Andy displays resilience through rebellion, by playing music over the prison loudspeaker, and refusing to continue with the money laundering scam.|$|R
2500|$|On 17 September 2008, a {{gas leak}} was {{discovered}} and one gas-injection well blown {{out in the}} area of the Central Azeri platform at the Azeri oilfield, a part of the Azeri–Chirag–Guneshli (ACG) project, in the Azerbaijan sector of Caspian Sea.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine, by Monte Carlo simulation, size {{and power of}} the Johansens trace test when the error {{covariance}} matrix is nonstationary, and we also investigate the properties of three different bootstrap cointegration tests. Earlier studies indicate that the Johansen trace test is not robust in presence of heteroscedasticity, and tests based on resampling methods have been proposed to solve the problem. The tests that are evaluated is the Johansen trace test, nonparametric bootstrap test and two different types of wild bootstrap tests. The wild bootstrap test is a resampling method that attempts to mimic the GARCH model by multiplying each residual by a stochastic variable with an expected value of zero and unit variance. The wild bootstrap tests proved to be superior to the other tests, but not as good as earlier indicated. The more the error terms differs from white noise, the worse these tests are doing. Although the wild bootstrap tests did not do <b>a</b> very <b>bad</b> <b>job,</b> the focus of further investigation should be to derive tests that does an even better job than the wild bootstrap tests examined here...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we review the {{arguments}} and consider {{evidence on the}} economic effects of minimum wages in Europe.

We consider the relation between minimum wage floors and two economic outcomes, employment {{and the distribution of}} income in working households. We find little evidence that minimum wages have <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> effect on <b>jobs</b> and some evidence that they have an equalising impact on the distribution of income among families with someone in work. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Laying eggs in nests of {{unrelated}} conspecific pairs to parasitize their {{parental care}} is a common phenomenon in birds. In blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus such conspecific brood parasitism (CBP) has never {{been reported in the}} literature. However, in a situation where breeding density was extremely high, we found six nests to be parasitized with eggs of conspecific females. Natural selection may favour elevated competitiveness of parasite young, since the negative consequences of increased sibling competition are incurred on the unrelated host parents and siblings, and therefore do not act as inclusive fitness costs for the parasites. Parasitizing females could achieve such a competitive advantage for their offspring by laying larger eggs or eggs with higher concentrations of testosterone in the yolk. We analyzed these parameters of the six parasitized nests, but did not find that parasite eggs differ systematically in these aspects from host eggs, nor that parasite eggs showed resemblance to host eggs. We suggest that a shortage of available nest sites caused some females to use CBP as <b>a</b> best-of-a <b>bad</b> <b>job</b> strategy, but that either the occurrence of CBP is too rare to lead to strong selection for egg adjustments or that parasitizing females are unable to do so. ...|$|R
