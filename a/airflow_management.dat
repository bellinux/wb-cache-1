Owing to the temperature dependent resistive losses in the machine's windings, any improvement in cooling provides a direct reduction in losses and an increase in efficiency. This study focuses on the airflow which is intrinsically linked to the thermal behaviour of the machine as well as the windage power consumed to drive the air through the machine. A full computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model has been used to analyse the airflow around all major components of the machine. Results have been experimentally validated and investigated. At synchronous speed the experimentally tested mass flow rate and windage torque were under predicted by 4 % and 7 %, respectively, by the CFD. A break-down of torque by component shows that the fan consumes approximately 87 % of the windage torque...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{architectural}} trends {{have included}} exploring {{open space and}} the extensive use of glass as building material. While the details of these large, light-exposed, open-air environments can be modeled as thermal fluid systems in CFD simulations, the use of dense sensor networks can provide real-time monitoring of a building's <b>airflow</b> and thermal <b>management</b> systems {{without the need for}} computationally-intensive theo-retical models, and can use this data to inform and advance these models. Sensor networks can provide an accurate picture of the actual conditions of a building and how those conditions can change over time, due to deterioration or external influ-ences. The information gathered from such networks will be critical in determining the energy efficiency of a building. To do this, a sensor network made of two types of sensors, temperature-humidity and airflow, was deployed in the large, glass-enclosed atrium of the recently-completed MIT Media Lab Extension (E 14) in late March 2010.

40|$|To breed cows for low methane production, farm {{measurement}} methods {{are required to}} measure individual methane production of cows. The long lying period of cows in cubicles could be utilised here. However, variable aerial conditions around cubicles may challenge this approach. The objective {{of this study was}} to (1) assess temporal and spatial variability of methane concentrations around cubicles; (2) explore influencing factors on them; and (3) assess effects of barn background variability in methane concentrations on assessed individual methane production. Concentrations around two cubicles in a naturally ventilated dairy barn were measured during a summer and a winter period. The effect of barn background variability in methane concentration on individual cow measurements was analysed in relation to the working principles of the breath methane concentration and methane flux methods. Mean methane concentrations around the cubicle were 29 â 37 ppm in the summer and 33 â 51 ppm in the winter period. Spatial variations of hourly averages of methane concentration around the cubicle were 71 % in the summer and 58 % in the winter period. Temporal variations of hourly averages of methane concentration varied from 115 to 153 % in the summer, and from 57 to 109 % in the winter period among the sample locations. These variations were mainly affected by <b>airflows</b> and barn <b>management.</b> The coefficient of variation (CV) of the background concentration strongly influenced the overall measurement CV of assessed methane production, in both the methane flux and breath methane concentration method.

40|$|Key Points Asthma is a {{heterogeneous}} syndrome ranging from mild disease with barely noticeable symptoms to very severe disease with constant symptoms that may greatly hinder patientsâ quality of life.; The aim of asthma treatment is control of asthma and {{the prevention of}} risk of exacerbations and fixed <b>airflow</b> limitation.; Asthma <b>management</b> must be individualised; tailored {{not only to the}} severity of the disease but importantly, to the phenotypic characteristics of the patient and modified according to response to treatment.; Educational Aims To inform readers about the current understanding on the treatment of asthma.; To highlight the usefulness of phenotypes in treating asthmatic patients, especially those with severe disease.; To introduce the issues of severe asthma management and future planning.; Asthma is a common, chronic and heterogeneous syndrome, affecting people of all ages, all races and both sexes. It may range from mild disease with barely noticeable symptoms, to very severe disease with constant symptoms that greatly hinder the life of the patient. Guidelines issued by various medical societies provide guidance on how to diagnose and manage asthmatic patients. It is now increasingly recognised that asthma management must be individualised, tailored not only to the severity of the disease but to the phenotypic characteristics of each patient. The aim of asthma treatment is control of asthma and the prevention of risk of exacerbations and fixed airflow limitation. Asthma control can be easily assessed clinically through simple screening tools {{such as the use of}} validated questionnaires and spirometry. The use of inflammatory biomarkers can be an alternative approach that, however, requires more time and resources. Asthma treatment involves the use of controllers, mainly inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting Î² 2 -agonists, and relievers, mainly rapid-acting Î² 2 -agonists. Controller medications reduce airway inflammation, lead to better symptom control and reduce the risk of future exacerbations. Reliever (rescue) medications alleviate symptoms and prevent exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Treatment must be based on a âstepwise approachâ in order to achieve good control of symptoms and to minimise future risks of exacerbations. That is, less treatment for mild disease, more treatment for severe, uncontrolled disease. Once good asthma control has been achieved and maintained, treatment should be stepped down. In severe asthmatics, phenotypic characterisation becomes more clinically useful and add-on treatment such as anti-immunoglobulin E monoclonal antibodies may be required. Despite our better understanding of asthma, there are still patients who will not respond to treatment and remain symptomatic. Dissemination of guidelines and national plans allowing early diagnosis of asthma as well as access to specialised primary and secondary care for asthmatic patients, personalised treatment and continuity of care may lead to excellence in care and controlled asthma for the majority of patients. Education of the patient in asthma is also very important, as in every chronic disease, as the patients live with the disease every day while they visit a healthcare professional a few times a year. Future planning for new treatments should focus on the needs of such severe asthma patients...|$|R
40|$|The power {{required}} to cool IT equipment will soon exceed the energy {{needed to run}} the system. Even without {{the introduction of the}} new generation of power-hungry blade servers, the accelerating energy requirements of data centres are making them more expensive and unstable to run. Jeremy Hartley explains why it is physics and not money that will solve the problems. Electricity bills are often not considerations in the budgets or strategies of IT managers so there is no incentive on the ground for cutting power consumption â so concerns over high availability take precedence. However, the new generation of blade servers are not only incredibly power-hungry, but also deeper than traditional servers, and so will be more difficult to cool. This will inevitably lead to a power surge when data centres start to adopt this technology, moving energy consumption up the agenda. The IT industry is under pressure to reduce its energy consumption. According to a report by McKinsey 1, the industry as a whole consumes 2 per cent of the world energy now and will generate as much CO 2 as the airline industry by 2020. There are already restrictions on the location of data centres {{as a result of their}} energy demands. In addition, the EU has launched a Best Practice Code of Conduct for data centres, which aims to encourage data centre owners and operators to voluntarily sign up to have the energy efficiency of their operations measured, and agree to an action plan and an annual progress report. Many data centre managers are under the illusion that to maintain optimum temperatures in the data centre you need to overcool the supply air. The truth is that you need to create conditions that make the servers â own fans work more effectively, and this can be achieved by improving <b>airflow</b> <b>management.</b> <b>Airflow</b> <b>management</b> cuts costs by reducing the volume of cooled air that needs to be supplied, and it will also improve the temperature distribution across the cabinets.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the task reported herein was to define, evaluate, and optimize variable geometry concepts suitable for use with a Rich-Quench-Lean (RQL) combustor. The specific intent was to identify approaches that would satisfy High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) cycle operational requirements with regard to fuel-air ratio turndown capability, ignition, and stability margin without compromising the stringent emissions, performance, and reliability goals that this combustor would have to achieve. Four potential configurations were identified and three of these were refined and tested in a high-pressure modular RQL combustor rig.

40|$|Two {{data centers}} {{in this study}} were within a {{co-location}} facility located on the sixth floor of a multi-story building in downtown Los Angeles, California. The facility had 37, 758 gross square feet floor area with 2 -foot raised-floors in the data services area. The two data centers were designated as the west data center (DC No. 18) and the east data center (DC No. 19). The study found that 56 % of the overall electric power was consumed by sixth floor critical loads in both data centers, 33 % of the power was consumed by HVAC systems, 3 % of the power was consumed by UPS units, 3 % of the power was for generator losses, and the remaining 5 % was used by lighting and miscellaneous loads in the building. The power density of installed computer loads (rack load) in the two data centers was 20 W/ft{sup 2 } and 56 W/ft{sup 2 }, respectively. The power density was relatively lower in DC No. 18 compared to other data centers previously studied. In addition, HVAC to IT power demand ratio was 0. 6 in DC No. 18 in this study, and was 0. 4 in DC No. 19. Two out of three chillers were running at a low partial load, making the operation very energy inefficient. The operation and control of the chillers and air-handling units should be optimized while providing sufficient cooling to the data centers. Although arranging hot aisle/cold aisle design to separate airflow streams would be difficult in such a co-location data center, optimizing air distribution should be pursued. General recommendations for improving overall data center energy efficiency include improving the design, operation, and control of mechanical systems serving the data centers with various critical loads in place. This includes chiller operation, chilled water system, AHUs, <b>airflow</b> <b>management</b> and control in data centers.

40|$|The {{data center}} {{in this study}} had a total floor area of 3, 024 square feet (ft{sup 2 }) with one-foot raised-floors. It was a rack lab with 147 racks, and was located in a 96, 000 ft{sup 2 } {{multi-story}} office building in San Jose, California. Since the data center was used only for testing equipment, it was not configured as a critical facility in terms of electrical and cooling supply. It {{did not have a}} dedicated chiller system but was served by the main building chiller plant and make-up air system. Additionally it was served by only a single electrical supply with no provision for backup power {{in the event of a}} power outage. The Data Center operated on a 24 hour per day, year-round cycle, and users had full-hour access to the data center facility. The study found that data center computer load accounted for 15 % of the overall building electrical load, while the total power consumption attributable to the data center including allocated cooling load and lighting was 22 % of the total facility load. The density of installed computer loads (rack load) in the data center was 61 W/ft{sup 2 }. Power consumption density for all data center allocated load (including cooling and lighting) was 88 W/ft{sup 2 }, approximately eight times the average overall power density in rest of the building (non-data center portion). The building and its data center cooling system was provided with various energy optimizing systems that included the following: (1) Varying chilled water flow rate through variable speed drives on the primary pumps. (2) No energy losses due to nonexistence of UPS or standby generators. (3) Minimized under-floor obstruction that affects the delivery efficiency of supply air. (4) Elimination of dehumidification/humidification within the CRAH units. For the data center, 70 % of the overall electric power was the rack critical loads, 14 % of the power was consumed by chillers, 12 % by CRAH units, 2 % by lighting system, and about 2 % of the power was consumed by chilled water pumps. General recommendations for improving overall data center energy efficiency include improving the lighting control, airflow optimization, control of mechanical systems serving the data center in actual operation [...] This includes chilled water system, <b>airflow</b> <b>management</b> and control in the data center.

40|$|The United Nation Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) {{makes it}} clear that climate change is due to human {{activities}} and it recognises buildings as a distinct sector among the seven analysed in its 2007 Fourth Assessment Report. Global concerns have escalated regarding carbon emissions and sustainability in the built environment. The built environment is a human-made setting to accommodate human activities, including building and transport, which covers an interdisciplinary field addressing design, construction, operation and management. Specifically, Sustainable Buildings are expected to achieve high performance throughout the life-cycle of siting, design, construction, operation, maintenance and demolition, in the following areas: â¢	energy and resource efficiency; â¢	cost effectiveness; â¢	minimisation of emissions that negatively impact global warming, indoor air quality and acid rain; â¢	minimisation of waste discharges; and â¢	maximisation of fulfilling the requirements of occupantsâ health and wellbeing. Professionals in the built environment sector, for example, urban planners, architects, building scientists, engineers, facilities managers, performance assessors and policy makers, will {{play a significant role in}} delivering a sustainable built environment. Delivering a sustainable built environment needs an integrated approach and so it is essential for built environment professionals to have interdisciplinary knowledge in building design and management. Building and urban designers need to have a good understanding of the planning, design and management of the buildings in terms of low carbon and energy efficiency. There are a limited number of traditional engineers who know how to design environmental systems (services engineer) in great detail. Yet there is a very large market for technologists with multi-disciplinary skills who are able to identify the need for, envision and manage the deployment of a wide range of sustainable technologies, both passive (architectural) and active (engineering system),, and select the appropriate approach. Employers seek applicants with skills in analysis, decision-making/assessment, computer simulation and project implementation. An integrated approach is expected in practice, which encourages built environment professionals to think âout of the boxâ and learn to analyse real problems using the most relevant approach, irrespective of discipline. The Design and Management of Sustainable Built Environment book aims to produce readers able to apply fundamental scientific research to solve real-world problems in the general area of sustainability in the built environment. The book contains twenty chapters covering climate change and sustainability, urban design and assessment (planning, travel systems, urban environment), urban management (drainage and waste), buildings (indoor environment, architectural design and renewable energy), simulation techniques (energy and <b>airflow),</b> <b>management</b> (end-user behaviour, facilities and information), assessment (materials and tools), procurement, and cases studies (BRE Science Park). Chapters one and two present general global issues of climate change and sustainability in the built environment. Chapter one illustrates that applying the concepts of sustainability to the urban environment (buildings, infrastructure, transport) raises some key issues for tackling climate change, resource depletion and energy supply. Buildings, and the way we operate them, play a vital role in tackling global greenhouse gas emissions. Holistic thinking and an integrated approach in delivering a sustainable built environment is highlighted. Chapter two demonstrates the important role that buildings (their services and appliances) and building energy policies play in this area. Substantial investment is required to implement such policies, much of which will earn a good return. Chapters three and four discuss urban planning and transport. Chapter three stresses the importance of using modelling techniques at the early stage for strategic master-planning of a new development and a retrofit programme. A general framework for sustainable urban-scale master planning is introduced. This chapter also addressed the needs for the development of a more holistic and pragmatic view of how the built environment performs,, in order to produce tools to help design for a higher level of sustainability and, in particular, how people plan, design and use it. Chapter four discusses microcirculation, which is an emerging and challenging area which relates to changing travel behaviour in the quest for urban sustainability. The chapter outlines the main drivers for travel behaviour and choices, the workings of the transport system and its interaction with urban land use. It also covers the new approach to managing urban traffic to maximise economic, social and environmental benefits. Chapters five and six present topics related to urban microclimates including thermal and acoustic issues. Chapter five discusses urban microclimates and urban heat island, as well as the interrelationship of urban design (urban forms and textures) with energy consumption and urban thermal comfort. It introduces models that can be used to analyse microclimates for a careful and considered approach for planning sustainable cities. Chapter six discusses urban acoustics, focusing on urban noise evaluation and mitigation. Various prediction and simulation methods for sound propagation in micro-scale urban areas, as well as techniques for large scale urban noise-mapping, are presented. Chapters seven and eight discuss urban drainage and waste management. The growing demand for housing and commercial developments in the 21 st century, as well as the environmental pressure caused by climate change, has increased the focus on sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS). Chapter seven discusses the SUDS concept which is an integrated approach to surface water management. It takes into consideration quality, quantity and amenity aspects to provide a more pleasant habitat for people as well as increasing the biodiversity value of the local environment. Chapter eight discusses the main issues in urban waste management. It points out that population increases, land use pressures, technical and socio-economic influences have become inextricably interwoven and how ensuring a safe means of dealing with humanityâs waste becomes more challenging. Sustainable building design needs to consider healthy indoor environments, minimising energy for heating, cooling and lighting, and maximising the utilisation of renewable energy. Chapter nine considers how people respond to the physical environment and how that is used in the design of indoor environments. It considers environmental components such as thermal, acoustic, visual, air quality and vibration and their interaction and integration. Chapter ten introduces the concept of passive building design and its relevant strategies, including passive solar heating, shading, natural ventilation, daylighting and thermal mass, in order to minimise heating and cooling load as well as energy consumption for artificial lighting. Chapter eleven discusses the growing importance of integrating Renewable Energy Technologies (RETs) into buildings, the range of technologies currently available and what to consider during technology selection processes in order to minimise carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels. The chapter draws to a close by highlighting the issues concerning system design and the need for careful integration and management of RETs once installed; and for home owners and operators to understand the characteristics of the technology in their building. Computer simulation tools play a significant role in sustainable building design because, as the modern built environment design (building and systems) becomes more complex, it requires tools to assist in the design process. Chapter twelve gives an overview of the primary benefits and users of simulation programs, the role of simulation in the construction process and examines the validity and interpretation of simulation results. Chapter thirteen particularly focuses on the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation method used for optimisation and performance assessment of technologies and solutions for sustainable building design and its application through a series of cases studies. People and building performance are intimately linked. A better understanding of occupantsâ interaction with the indoor environment is essential to building energy and facilities management. Chapter fourteen focuses on the issue of occupant behaviour; principally, its impact, and the influence of building performance on them. Chapter fifteen explores the discipline of facilities management and the contribution that this emerging profession makes to securing sustainable building performance. The chapter highlights a much greater diversity of opportunities in sustainable building design that extends well into the operational life. Chapter sixteen reviews the concepts of modelling information flows and the use of Building Information Modelling (BIM), describing these techniques and how these aspects of information management can help drive sustainability. An explanation is offered concerning why information management is the key to âlife-cycleâ thinking in sustainable building and construction. Measurement of building performance and sustainability is a key issue in delivering a sustainable built environment. Chapter seventeen identifies the means by which construction materials can be evaluated with respect to their sustainability. It identifies the key issues that impact the sustainability of construction materials and the methodologies commonly used to assess them. Chapter eighteen focuses on the topics of green building assessment, green building materials, sustainable construction and operation. Commonly-used assessment tools such as BRE Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and others are introduced. Chapter nineteen discusses sustainable procurement which is one of the areas to have naturally emerged from the overall sustainable development agenda. It aims to ensure that current use of resources does not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Chapter twenty is a best-practice exemplar - the BRE Innovation Park which features a number of demonstration buildings that have been built to the UK Governmentâs Code for Sustainable Homes. It showcases the very latest innovative methods of construction, and cutting edge technology for sustainable buildings. In summary, Design and Management of Sustainable Built Environment book is the result of co-operation and dedication of individual chapter authors. We hope readers benefit from gaining a broad interdisciplinary knowledge of design and management in the built environment in the context of sustainability. We believe that the knowledge and insights of our academics and professional colleagues from different institutions and disciplines illuminate a way of delivering sustainable built environment through holistic integrated design and management approaches. Last, but not least, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the chapter authors for their contribution. I would like to thank David Lim for his assistance in the editorial work and proofreading. ...|$|E
