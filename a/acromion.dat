Aim of the research: To find a method that can prevent poor posture, is effective and attractive for children, {{and can be used}} on a wide scale in state schools. Material and methods : Seventy-seven first year pupils were tested at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the school year. Nineteen children undertook corrective exercises using unstable surfaces; 41 children sat on sensorimotor pillows during classes; and 17 children were the control group. Body mass and body height were measured. Body mass index was calculated. The symmetry of the position of selected skeletal points was assessed: the <b>acromions,</b> lower angles of the scapulas, apexes of the iliac crests, antero-superior iliac spine, and postero-superior iliac spine using a Duometer electronic device. The differences between the groups and changes between the first and second study for each group were estimated. Results : In the first study there were no significant differences in quality of posture. In the second study a significant improvement was noted in symmetry of the shoulders, scapulas, and pelvis {{in children}} who sat on sensorimotor pillows, as well as the position of the iliac crests and iliac spines in children exercising regularly on unstable surfaces.

40|$|Abstract Introduction: Mouth {{breathing}} {{can lead}} to changes in body posture and pulmonary function. However, the consequences are still inconclusive {{and a number of}} studies are controversial. Objective: Evaluate and correlate spirometric parameters and postural measures in mouth breathing children, and compare them to nose breathers. Methods: two groups of 6 to 12 year-old children were evaluated: mouth breathers (MB, n = 55) and nose breathers (NB, n = 45). Spirometry and body posture analysis using photogrammetry (SAPo 0. 68 ® v) were carried out. The following spirometric measures were evaluated: peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV 1 /FVC ratio (%) and forced expiratory flow between 25 % and 75 % of FVC (FEF 25 - 75 %). Biophotogrammetric measures analyzed were: horizontal alignment of <b>acromions</b> (HAA) and anterior superior iliac spine (HAASIS), Charpy angle, horizontal alignment of the head (HAH), cervical lordosis (CL), thoracic kyphosis (TK), lumbar lordosis (LL), cervical distance (CD) and lumbar distance (LD). Results: There were no intergroup differences in spirometric and postural variables. Positive and moderate correlations were found between CL and CD measures with PEF, FEV 1, FVC and FEF 25 - 75 %, while weak correlations were observed between lumbar lordosis and PEF, FEV 1 and FVC. Conclusion: The breathing mode had no influence on postural and respiratory measures. However, greater forward head posture, with smaller cervical lordosis, was related to higher lung volumes and flows in both groups...|$|R
40|$|The International Society of Biomechanics {{detailed}} the recommendations for 3 D kinematics of intervertebral movements (Wu, et al. 2002. J Biomech. 35 : 543 - 548), {{but does not}} specify how to adapt this proposal to describe the kinematics of the cervical spine, between the head and the thorax. The analysis of the literature shows that no consensus exists {{at the present time}} on this subject. The objective of our study was to identify the reference points that formed the most rigid triplet allowing building an optimal thorax segment coordinate system (SCS). We thus measured the variations of distances between markers placed on various anatomical landmarks, and then the deformations of the combinations of three markers on different cervical movements of a sample of 10 asymptomatic subjects. The results show that the triplet formed by the sternum and both <b>acromions</b> undergoes less deformation on the flexion-extension movement. For all the other movements (lateral bending, axial rotation and complex movements), the triplet formed by sternum, T 3 and TH (positioned on the thoracic spinal column, in a horizontal plane containing the sternal marker), undergoes less deformation. As a conclusion, the optimal triplet to define the thorax SCS for 3 D kinematical analysis of the cervical spine is that formed by the markers: sternum, T 3 and TH. This triplet makes it possible to define an orthonormal SCS, the axes of which coincide with anatomical directions, i. e. with the functional axes of the movement...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The stomatognathic {{system is}} a set of {{structures}} that are interconnected to perform vital functions. Changes in any of the parts may lead to a general postural imbalance. Purpose: To verify if there is a relation between breathing pattern and swallowing with posture, dental occlusion and harmful oral habits of the sample under study. Materials and methods: The final sample of n= 50 consisted of 34 children/ adolescents males and 16 females. The evaluation consisted of a questionnaire about signs and symptoms of mouth breathing, a clinical evaluation and a photogrammetric postural assessment, performed through software for Postural Assessment (SAPO®). Data analysis using descriptive and inferential statistics were obtained using the SPSS- 21. 0 software, and it was used a α= 0. 05 significance level. Results: There was a predominance of head tilt to the left, right shoulder elevation and tendency to tilt the head forward in mouth breathers. Regarding the occlusion there was a predominance of Angle Class II malocclusion and the presence of a greater number of children with open bite that also presented oral breathing and atypical swallowing patterns. The study of the deleterious oral habits allowed to determine a relationship between the pattern of mouth breathing and atypical swallowing with digital sucking habits and pacifier use. Conclusion: Statistically significant associations were established between the breathing pattern and the horizontal alignment of <b>acromions,</b> as well as the horizontal and vertical alignment of the head; between the pattern of breathing and swallowing with occlusal relationship anteroposterior and occlusal relationship vertical and also between breathing pattern and swallowing with digital sucking habits and pacifier use...|$|R
40|$|To characterise the {{physiological}} pattern of trunk and shoulders movements during walking {{and provide a}} reference for further studies on spine deformities. Implementation of a model for measuring spine and shoulder girdle movements during gait. Data collection on a population of eighteen, young, healthy, female subjects.

Retroreflective markers were positioned on the main spine processes and <b>acromions</b> to be detected by a TV-based motion analysis system. A model of kinematic computation was implemented and integrated in a previously developed protocol for multifactorial gait analysis. Movements in the main reference planes and in relation to pelvis were analysed. The trunk was on average bent forward by 3. 4 degrees with respect to standing; of the two physiological curves in the sagittal plane only lordosis changed during walking; in the frontal plane, a dynamic spine deformation appeared, that was maximum at heel strike-early stance; the trunk was bent controlaterally of the foot on the ground, while the shoulders remained stable; in the horizontal plane, the shoulders rotated contralaterally to the pelvis. In our population all the segmental movements analysed were smaller than 5 degrees during gait, except the angle of proximal curvature in the frontal plane, shoulder rotation, and angle between shoulders and pelvis; all the measured angles were far below their possible ranges of motion. Quantitative data on upper body kinematics as a complement to gait analysis can help understanding movement disorders and compensation strategies in several pathologies...|$|R
40|$|T. N. B., a forty-three-year-old white man, was {{admitted}} to the North Carolina Memorial Hospital for investigation of hypertension and angina pectoris. He was seen in orthopaedic consultation because of restricted mobility of his left shoulder. He said that this restriction had been present all of his life and had not changed. The patient estimated that the strength of his left upper extremity was two-thirds that of his right. The limited abduc-tion of his left shoulder had prevented him from becoming active in athletics but had not interfered with his duties as chief engineer for a radio station. He had also noted asymmetry of his low-back region and inequality of leg lengths. There was no history of paralytic disease or fracture. His general health had always been good. There was no familial history of congenital anomaly. The patient had been born of an uneventful full-term pregnancy. On being questioned specifically, the patient’s mother stated that she had not had measles, German measles, or any other infectious disease during pregnancy. Physical examination revealed a well developed, well nourished white man of forty-three who did not ap-pear ill.

50|$|The Protocetids, {{known from}} both Africa and America, were a diversified family with hind limbs {{and a strong}} tail, {{indicating}} that they were strong swimmers that colonized shallow and warm oceans, such as reefs. They greatly affected cetacean evolution , because they spread across Earth's oceans. They had long snouts, large eyes, and a nasal opening located farther up the head than in earlier archaecetes — suggesting they could breathe with the head held horizontally, similar to modern cetaceans — a first step towards a blowhole. Their dentition varied, but started to evolve towards the non-masticating teeth of modern cetaceans, and they were probably active hunters. Their hindlimbs were reduced and probably short. In some species, the pelvis was not connected to the vertebral column, suggesting the hindlimbs could not have supported the body weight.Basilosaurids, which had tiny hindlimbs and flipper-shaped forelimbs, were obligatory aquatic and came to dominate the oceans. They still lacked the echolocation and baleen tooth of modern odontocetes and mysticeti. Basilosaurids and dorudontids are the oldest obligate aquatic cetaceans for which the entire skeleton is known. They display a number of aquatic adaptations not present in earlier archaeocetes: In the vertebral column, the neck vertebrae are short, the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae of similar length, the sacral vertebrae are unfused, the sacroiliac joints are absent, and the short tail has a ball vertebra (indicating {{the presence of a}} fluke). The scapulae are broad and fan-shaped with anterior <b>acromions</b> and small supraspinous fossae.

40|$|Abstract Background Proximal humerus {{fractures}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} common fractures. Intramedullary locked nailing is becoming a popular alternative treatment, especially for easier fracture patterns. Although axillary nerve injury has been reported, no study has compared the safety of the proximal locking options relative to the axillary nerve and the ascending branch of the anterior circumflex artery. Method Six different commercially available proximal humeral nails were implanted in 30 shoulders of 18 cadavers. After fluoroscopically guided implantation the shoulders were carefully dissected and the distance between the locking screws, the axillary nerve and the ascending branch of the anterior circumflex artery was measured. Results The course of the axillary nerve varies. A mean distance of 55. 8 mm (SD = 5. 3) between the lateral edge of the <b>acromions</b> and the axillary nerve at the middle of the humerus in a neutrally rotated position was observed. The minimum distance was 43. 4 mm, the maximum 63. 9 mm. Bent nails with oblique head interlocking bolts appeared to be the most dangerous in relation to the axillary nerve. The two designs featuring such a bend and oblique bolt showed a mean distance of the locking screw to the axillary nerve of 1 mm and 2. 7 mm respectively Sirus (Zimmer ®) and (Stryker ®) T 2 PHN (Proximal Humeral Nail)). Regarding the ascending branch of the anterior circumflex artery, there was no difference between the nails which have an anteroposterior locking option. Conclusion It is of great importance for surgeons treating proximal humerus fractures to understand the relative risk of any procedure they perform. Since the designs of different nailing systems risk damaging the axillary nerve and ascending branch, blunt dissection, the use of protection sleeves during drilling and screw insertion, and individual risk evaluation prior to the use of a proximal humeral nail are advocated. </p...|$|R

O objetivo deste estudo foi descrever e associar postura ortostática, execução de Atividades de Vida Diária (AVDs), Amplitude de Movimento Articular (ADM) e dor nas costas de escolares. Foram avaliados 430 escolares do ensino fundamental da Rede Municipal de Ensino de Porto Alegre – RS, com idade entre 6 e 18 anos. Foi realizada avaliação da postura ortostática, da postura dinâmica (sentar para escrever e transportar o material escolar), teste de Adams, mensurações do ângulo Q, mensurações das ADMs do quadril, joelho e tornozelo, teste de Schober total e lombar, teste de extensão da coluna total e lombar e avaliação da dor. Os resultados mostraram uma tendência dos escolares posicionarem-se anteriormente ao fio de prumo, independente da faixa etária em que se encontravam. A angulação média observada nas curvaturas da coluna foi 28, 67 º para lordose cervical, 26, 47 º para cifose dorsal e 24, 42 º para lordose lombar. A avaliação do alinhamento horizontal de pontos anatômicos mostrou que estavam alinhados 10, 1 % dos acrômios, 19, 4 % das espinhas ilíacas ântero superiores (E. I. A. S.), 20, 8 % dos ângulos inferiores das escápulas e 42, 9 % das espinhas ilíacas póstero superiores (E. I. P. S.). O valor médio obtido para ângulo Q do joelho direito foi de 16, 20 º; e para o joelho esquerdo, 16, 60 º. O teste de Adams foi positivo em 21, 4 % com predominância de saliência paraespinhal lombar esquerda seguida de gibosidade dorso-lombar esquerda. Na avaliação da postura sentada para escrever, na qual os avaliados poderiam atingir de 0 a 4 pontos, o maior percentual de escolares obteve um ponto no momento 1 e zero nos momentos 2, 3 e 4 da filmagem. A avaliação sobre transportar material escolar mostrou que 69, 2 % dos escolares usam mochila e seu peso ultrapassa 10 % do peso corporal somente em 9 % dos casos. Comparando as médias das ADMs apresentadas pelos avaliados com as divulgadas pela literatura, observou-se que as amplitudes de rotação interna e externa da coxo-femural e flexão plantar do tornozelo do grupo avaliado foram menores. Os escolares apresentaram o valor médio de 8, 01 cm para teste de Schober total, o que estava abaixo do considerado adequado pela literatura. Dor foi referida por 29 % dos escolares. A região lombar foi a mais mencionada e a intensidade predominou entre média e fraca. Não foi verificada associação entre dor e peso da mochila. Ocorreu diferença significativa entre os que sentiam e não sentiam dor no terceiro momento da análise da filmagem da posição sentada. A amplitude do movimento de flexão da articulação coxo-femural com joelho direito flexionado apresentou diferença significativa entre os que sentiam e não sentiam dor, sendo maior nos que sentiam dor. Os resultados deste estudo fornecem informações a respeito da postura corporal dos escolares do ensino fundamental das escolas municipais de Porto Alegre. Não foi feita uma investigação com o intuito de verificar o que estava certo ou errado, mas de conhecer melhor os escolares e auxiliar na criação de projetos de educação postural adequados à realidade desta população. Painful simphtoms, from overload {{and body}} structural alteration {{are present in}} the adult and infant-juvenile population. The objective {{of this study was to}} describe and to associate orthostatic posture, execution of daily activities (DA), range of motion (ROM) and students back pain. It was evaluated 430 Fundamental School students of Municipal Schools from Porto Alegre-RS, aged between 6 and 8 years old. The orthostatic posture was evaluated, dynamic posture (sitting to write and to carry the school material), Adam’s forward-bending test, Q-angle measurement, measurement of the hip, knee and ankle ROMs, total and lumbar Schober test, extension test of the total and lumbar spine and pain evaluation. The results showed a tendency of the students to position themselves forward to the reference line, regardless of their age. The mean angulation observed on the spine curvature was 28, 67 º for the cervical lordosis, 26, 47 º for the thoracic kyphosis and 24, 42 º for the lumbar lordosis. The evaluation of the horizontal alignment of the anatomic points showed that were aligned 10, 1 % of the <b>acromions,</b> 19, 4 % of the anterior superior iliac spines(E. I. A. S), 20, 8 % of the inferior angle of the scapula and 42, 9 % of the superior anterior iliac spines(E. I. P. S). The mean value obtained for the right knee Q- angle was 16, 20 º and for the left knee it was 16, 60 %. The Adams forward-bending test was positive in 21, 4 % with predominance of the left lumbar flank prominence followed by left dorso-lumbar thoracic rotational prominence. On the evaluation of posture while students were writing, where the evaluated could reach from 0 to 4 points, the biggest percentage of the students got one point on the moment 1 and zero on the moments 2, 3 and 4 of the filming. The evaluation of carrying school material showed that 69, 2 % of the students wear backpack and its weight goes over 10 % of the body weight only in 9 % of the cases. Comparing the ROMs means presented by the evaluated with the ones publicized through the literature, it was observed that the range of the hip external and internal rotation and the ankle plantar flexion from the evaluated group were smaller. The students presented the mean value of 8, 01 cm for the total Schober test which was lower of the considered appropriate by the literature. The back pain was referred by 29 % of the students. The lumbar region was the most mentioned and the intensity predominated between medium and low. It was not verified the relation between back pain and weight of the backpack. There were a significant difference between the ones that felt pain and the ones that did not feel pain on the third moment of the filming when they were in the sitting position. The range of the right hip flexion with the knee flexed presented significant difference between the ones that felt pain and the ones that did not feel pain, being stronger on the ones that felt pain. The results of this study give information about the body posture of the students from the municipal schools in Porto Alegre. It was not made any investigation in order to verify what was right or wrong, but just to know the students better and help them with educational postural projects, appropriated to this population reality...|$|R
25|$|The final {{common factor}} is {{impingement}} syndrome, {{the most common}} non-sports related injury and which occurs when the tendons of the rotator cuff muscles become irritated and inflamed while passing through the subacromial space beneath the <b>acromion.</b> This relatively small space becomes even smaller when the arm is raised in a forward or upward position. Repetitive impingement can inflame the tendons and bursa, resulting in the syndrome.|$|E
25|$|At {{the upper}} part of the fossa is a {{transverse}} depression, where the bone appears to be bent on itself along a line at right angles to and passing through the center of the glenoid cavity, forming a considerable angle, called the subscapular angle; this gives greater strength to the body of the bone by its arched form, while the summit of the arch serves to support the spine and <b>acromion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tendinitis is {{inflammation}} (redness, soreness, and swelling) of a tendon. In tendinitis of the shoulder, the {{rotator cuff}} and/or biceps tendon become inflamed, usually {{as a result}} of being pinched by surrounding structures. The injury may vary from mild inflammation to involvement of most of the rotator cuff. When the rotator cuff tendon becomes inflamed and thickened, it may get trapped under the <b>acromion.</b> Squeezing of the rotator cuff is called impingement syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The scapula {{had a large}} {{rectangular}} <b>acromion,</b> with a sharp upper corner, on {{the lower}} front edge. The more narrow coracoid had a rounded lower edge. Both the upper arm and ulna and radius (lower arm bones) are also {{comparable to those of}} Stegosaurus. The tuberosity of the rear humerus serving as attachment for the musculus triceps brachii is well-developed but the vertical ridge running from it to below is not. In the pelvis, the pubic bone had a deep front part, the processus praepubicus, with a little upward projecting process as seen in Dacentrurus; the rear shaft had a lightly expanded tip.|$|E
25|$|The tendons of the rotator cuff, not the muscles, {{are most}} {{commonly}} involved, {{and of the}} four, the supraspinatus is most frequently affected, as it passes below the <b>acromion.</b> The role of the supraspinatus is to resist downward motion. The supraspinatus resists downward motion while the shoulder is relaxed as well as when carrying weight. Such a tear usually occurs at its point of insertion onto the humeral head at the greater tubercle. Even though the supraspinatus is the most commonly injured muscle of the four muscles in the rotator cuff, the other three muscles that comprise the rotator cuff, the infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis, may also be injured.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the four muscles of the rotator cuff, the deltoid muscle and teres major muscles arise and exist in the shoulder region itself. The deltoid muscle covers the shoulder joint on three sides, arising from the front upper third of the clavicle, the <b>acromion,</b> and {{the spine of the}} scapula, and travelling to insert on the deltoid tubercle of the humerus. Contraction of each part of the deltoid assists in different movements of the shoulder - flexion (clavicular part), abduction (middle part) and extension (scapular part). The teres major attaches to the outer part {{of the back of the}} scapula, beneath the teres minor, and attaches to the upper part of the humerus. It helps with medial rotation of the humerus.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fossil}} therapsids, a third bone, the true coracoid, formed {{just behind the}} procoracoid. The {{resulting}} three-boned structure is still seen in modern monotremes, but in all other living mammals, the procoracoid has disappeared, and the coracoid bone has fused with the scapula, to become the coracoid process. These changes {{are associated with the}} upright gait of mammals, compared with the more sprawling limb arrangement of reptiles and amphibians; the muscles formerly attached to the procoracoid are no longer required. The altered musculature is also responsible for the alteration {{in the shape of the}} rest of the scapula; the forward margin of the original bone became the spine and <b>acromion,</b> from which the main shelf of the shoulder blade arises as a new structure.|$|E
25|$|Anti-inflammatory {{medicines}} such as aspirin, naproxen or ibuprofen {{among others}} {{can be taken to}} help with pain. In some cases the physical therapist will use ultrasound and electrical stimulation, as well as manipulation. Gentle stretching and strengthening exercises are added gradually. If there is no improvement, the doctor may inject a corticosteroid medicine into the space under the <b>acromion.</b> However, recent level one evidence showed limited efficacy of corticosteroid injections for pain relief. While steroid injections are a common treatment, they must be used with caution because they may lead to tendon rupture. If there is still no improvement after 6 to 12 months, the doctor may perform either arthroscopic or open surgery to repair damage and relieve pressure on the tendons and bursae.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the exact}} {{orientation}} of the pectoral girdle in vivo is uncertain, the scapulae and coracoids are generally {{thought to have been}} oblique to the major planes of {{orientation of the}} rest of the body, rendering orientational descriptors somewhat difficult to select. Aside from the glenoid region, which is damaged or missing in both specimens, the preserved parts of the left and right scapulae complement one another to give a full picture of the morphology of the element. The scapulae consist of a broad proximal plate comprising an <b>acromion</b> and acromial fossa and a blade that forms more than half the length of the bone. The lateral surface of the acromial plate is excavated anterior to the acromial ridge and dorsal to the glenoid region. The acromial ridge is slightly posteriorly deflected, such that it is oriented at an acute angle to the long axis of the scapular blade. Immediately posterior to the glenoid articular surface, the ventral margin of the scapula is broad and convex transversely, but rapidly narrows as it merges into the base of the blade. No prominent subtriangular process seems to occur along the posteroventral edge of the proximal scapula, though its absence could be due to damage. A broad ridge extends longitudinally along the proximal third of the lateral face of the blade. The dorsal margin of the blade is straight, whereas the ventral margin expands distally such that the ratio of the maximum to minimum blade dorsoventral height is 1.7, less than the originally described value of ca. 2. The development of the <b>acromion</b> and distal expansion of the blade are similar to those of other somphospondylans and not as marked as in rebbachisaurids.|$|E
25|$|The {{shoulder}} {{consists of}} a ball-and-socket joint formed by the humerus and scapula and their surrounding structures - ligaments, muscles, tendons - which support the bones and maintain the relationship of one to another. These supporting structures attach to the clavicle, humerus, and scapula, the latter providing the glenoid cavity, <b>acromion</b> and coracoid processes. The main joint of the shoulder is the shoulder joint (or glenohumeral joint), between the humerus and the glenoid process of the scapular. The acromioclavicular joint and sternoclavicular joint {{also play a role}} in shoulder movements. White hyaline cartilage on the ends of the bones (called articular cartilage) allows the bones to glide and move on each other, and the joint space is surrounded by a synovial membrane. Around the joint space are muscles - the rotator cuff, which directly surrounds and attaches to the shoulder joint - and other muscles that help provide stability and facilitate movement.|$|E
500|$|With {{multiple}} well-preserved skeletons, S. stenops preserves {{all regions}} of the body, including the limbs. The scapula (shoulder blade) is sub-rectangular, with a robust blade. Though {{it is not always}} perfectly preserved, the <b>acromion</b> ridge is slightly larger than in Kentrosaurus. The blade is relatively straight, although it curves towards the back. There is a small bump {{on the back of the}} blade, that would have served as the base of the triceps muscle. Articulated with the scapula, the coracoid is sub-circular. The hind feet each had three short toes, while each fore foot had five toes; only the inner two toes had a blunt hoof. The phalangeal formula is 2-2-2-2-1, meaning the innermost finger of the fore limb has two bones, the next has two, etc. All four limbs were supported by pads behind the toes. The fore limbs were much shorter than the stocky hind limbs, which resulted in an unusual posture. The tail appears to have been held well clear of the ground, while the head of Stegosaurus was positioned relatively low down, probably no higher than [...] above the ground.|$|E
2500|$|X-ray projectional {{radiography}} cannot directly reveal {{tears of}} the rotator cuff, a 'soft tissue', and consequently, normal X-rays cannot exclude a damaged cuff. However, indirect evidence of pathology {{may be seen}} in instances where {{one or more of the}} tendons have undergone degenerative calcification (calcific tendinitis). The humeral head may migrate upwards (high-riding humeral head) secondary to tears of the infraspinatus, or combined tears of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. Prolonged contact between a high-riding humeral head and the <b>acromion</b> above it, may lead to X-rays findings of wear on the humeral head and <b>acromion</b> and secondary degenerative arthritis of the glenohumeral joint (the ball and socket joint of the shoulder), called cuff arthropathy, may follow. Incidental X-ray [...] findings of bone spurs at the adjacent acromioclavicular joint may show a bone spur growing from the outer edge of the clavicle downwards towards the rotator cuff. Spurs may also be seen on the underside of the <b>acromion,</b> once thought to cause direct fraying of the rotator cuff from contact friction, a concept currently regarded as controversial.|$|E
