25|$|Transgender people {{experience}} a mismatch between their gender identity or gender expression and their assigned sex. Transgender {{is also an}} umbrella term because, in addition to including trans men and trans women whose binary gender identity {{is the opposite of}} their assigned sex (and who are sometimes specifically termed transsexual if they desire medical assistance to transition), it may include genderqueer people (whose identities are not exclusively masculine or feminine, but may, for example, be bigender, pangender, genderfluid, or <b>agender).</b> Other definitions include third-gender people as transgender or conceptualize transgender people as a third gender, and infrequently the term is defined very broadly to include cross-dressers.|$|E
500|$|The gender {{identity}} [...] "transgender" [...] has been recategorized to trans* by some groups, where trans (without the asterisk) {{has been used}} to describe trans men and trans women, while trans* covers all non-cisgender (genderqueer) identities, including transgender, transsexual, transvestite, genderqueer, genderfluid, non-binary, genderfuck, genderless, <b>agender,</b> non-gendered, third gender, two-spirit, bigender, and trans man and trans woman. Likewise, the term transsexual commonly falls under the umbrella term transgender, but some transsexual people object to this.|$|E
2500|$|Nonbinary individuals, {{or those}} who {{identify}} outside of the male/female gender binary and use labels such as genderqueer, <b>agender,</b> bigender, and genderfluid, perform gender in a unique way. In their rejection of a strictly gendered societal and linguistic binary system, nonbinary folks {{have the freedom to}} choose or adopt a wider variety of linguistic styles, speech patterns, and vocabulary. The very nature of nonbinary identities in modern binary society forces individuals and communities to create vocabulary and redesign language to fit their understanding of gender, especially in English and Romance languages. Neopronouns, pronouns which avoid indexing gender and/or index a nonbinary gender identity, originated in the late 1800s as [...] "thon" [...] and [...] "e" [...] to refer to people without defining gender. Newer pronouns include [...] "ee," [...] "em," [...] "xe," [...] and [...] "ve." [...] Communities, especially online ones, create words to fill non-gendered spaces in the lexicon: [...] "nibling" [...] as a gender-neutral term for niece or nephew, or [...] "datefriend" [...] to replace [...] "boyfriend" [...] and [...] "girlfriend." ...|$|E

5000|$|An <b>agender</b> person ('−' meaning [...] "without"), {{also called}} genderless, genderfree, non-gendered, or ungendered, {{is someone who}} {{identifies}} as having no gender or being without a gender identity. [...] Although this category includes {{a broad range of}} identities which do not conform to traditional gender norms, scholar Finn Enke states that people who identify with any of these positions may not necessarily self-identify as transgender. <b>Agender</b> people have no specific set of pronouns; singular they is typically used, {{but it is not the}} default. Neutrois and <b>agender</b> were two of 50 available custom genders on Facebook, which were added on 13 February 2014. <b>Agender</b> is also available as a gender option on OkCupid since 17 November 2014.|$|E

5000|$|In agenderism, the {{division}} of people into women and men (in the psychical sense), is considered erroneous and artificial. <b>Agendered</b> individuals are those who reject genderic labeling in conception of self-identity and other matters. They see their subjectivity through the term [...] "person" [...] instead of [...] "woman" [...] or [...] "man". According to E. O. Wright, genderless people can have traits, behaviors and dispositions that correspond to what is currently viewed as [...] "feminine" [...] and [...] "masculine", and the mix of these would vary across persons. Nevertheless it doesn't suggest that everyone would be androgynous in their identities and practices {{in the absence of}} gendered relations. What disappears in the idea of genderlessness is any expectation that some characteristics and dispositions are strictly attributed to a person of any biological sex.|$|R
40|$|Migration {{scholarship}} has often lagged behind developments in gender studies. The importance of gender has gained increasing recognition {{but this has}} predominantly meant a focus on women migrants; only recently has <b>agendered</b> lens been turned {{to the study of}} migrant men. Discourses surrounding migrationin law andgovernment, and in legal scholarship, remain characterised by neglect or dismissal of the gendered experiences of male migrants. Where they do appear, men are frequently cast as the oppressor of family members or as abusing legal channels of migration. Their vulnerabilities and affective ties and needs are rarely foregrounded. This negative representation may be instrumentalizedat a variety of levels, and for a variety of purposes, making it difficult for more nuanced critiques to gain purchase. This Special Issue seeks to extend the discussion of migration and gender by exploring the ways in which men’s gendered experiences of migration remain marginalised...|$|R

40|$|This article {{identifies}} and critiques presumptions {{about gender}} and violence {{that continue to}} frame and inform the processes of policy formation and implementation on domestic violence. It also deconstructs the <b>agendered</b> nature of policy as gendered, multilevel individual and collective action. Drawing on comparative illustrative material from Finland and Scotland, we discuss how national policies and discourses emphasize physical forms of violence, place the onus on the agency of women, and encourage a narrow conceptualization of violence in relationships. The two countries do this in somewhat comparable, though different ways operating within distinct national gender contexts. The complex interweaving of masculinities, violence, and cultures, although recognized in many debates, is seemingly marginalized from dominant discourses, policy, and legal processes. Despite growth in critical studies on men, there is little attempt made to problematize the gendered nature of violence. Rather, policy and service outcomes reflect processes through which individualized and masculine discourses frame ideas, discourses, and policy work. Women experiencing violence are constructed as victims and potential survivors of violence, although the social and gendered hierarchies evident in policies and services result in longer-term inequities and suffering for women and their dependent...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Leadership {{theories}} {{have moved from}} viewing leadership as a personality trait,towards models that recognise leadership as a social construction. Alongside thistheorisation, gender and leadership remains of considerable interest, particularly given theunder-representation of women in leadership positions. Methodological approaches tounderstanding leadership have begun to embrace innovative methods, such as historicalanalyses. The current study aims to understand how high profile women leaders construct <b>agendered</b> leadership identity, with particular reference to authentic leadership. Approach: Thematic analysis of autobiographies, a form of identity work, of four womenleaders from business and politics; Sheryl Sandberg, Karren Brady, Hillary Clinton and JuliaGillard. Findings: Analyses reveal that these women construct gender and leadership along familiarnormative lines; for example, the emphasis on personal and familial values. However, theirstories differ in that the normative extends to include close examination {{of the body and}} asense of responsibility to other women. Overall, media representations of these ‘authentic’leaders conform to social constructions of gender. Thus in the case of authentic leadership,a theory presented as gender neutral, the authenticity of leadership has to some extent beencrafted by the media rather than the leader. Value: The study reveals that despite attempts to ‘craft’ and control the image of theauthentic self for consumption by followers, gendered media representations of individualsand leadership remain. Thus, alternative approaches to crafting an authentic leadership self which extend beyond (mainstream) media is suggested...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of European {{integration}} processes, Ukraine faces the challenge of tolerant attitudes towards people with alternative gender identity. At the same time, in the Ukrainian anti-discriminatory legislation (2012) sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) is not mentioned. According to the law, a person cannot change her or his documents prior to the surgery. Transgender phenomenon in Ukraine is a ?silenced? issue and {{is not on the}} public agenda. Transgender people in Ukraine are less researched, compare to homosexual ones. There is lack of sociological research on the situation of transgender people in Ukraine, their rights and freedoms. Only few LGBT NGOs (out of around thirty) work with transgender issues. NGO ?Insight? (2008) conducted two studies on transgender people in Ukraine. In 2014, ?The study of transgender and their needs for care services for HIV? was published by HIV/AIDS Alliances in Ukraine. All results support the idea that the rights and freedoms of transgender persons are constantly violated, they are discriminated against in all spheres of life. In 2013 - 2014, the authors conducted their own empirical exploratory research based on 10 in-depth interviews with 10 transgender people in Ukraine (among witch 2 FtM, 4 MtF, 3 <b>agenders,</b> and 1 crossdresser). Discrimination on the basis of gender identity is defined on two levels: socialization and institutional. Discrimination on the level of socialization includes discrimination in education (lack of necessary professional information on LGBT topics for transgender youth); discrimination in the family (when family members deny transgender identity of their children, considering them mentally ill); and discrimination and rejection in school or at work (persecution or refusal to hire). Institutional discrimination includes discriminatory legislation, problems with documents, discrimination in health care (bad attitudes of medical personnel towards transgender people, unprofessional knowledge in transgender health etc.). ? ?????? ???????????? ?????????? ???????????? ????????????? ??????????????? ???????????? ?????????????? ????? ? ???????. ????????????????? ??????? ????????? ???????????? ? ????????? ???????? ???????????? ?? ?????????????? ?????, ???????????????? ??????????????? ???????????? ? ???????. ???????? ?????????? ????????????? ? ?????????? ???????????? ? ????????????? ?????????????. ???????????????? ????????????? ?? ???????????????? ? ????????????????? ???????...|$|R

50|$|Genderqueer or non-binary identities, {{which are}} not {{exclusively}} masculine or feminine but instead are <b>agender,</b> androgynous, bigender, pangender, or genderfluid, exist outside of cisnormativity. Bigender and androgynous are overlapping categories; bigender individuals may identify as moving {{between male and female}} roles (genderfluid) or as being both male and female simultaneously (androgynous), and androgynes may similarly identify as beyond gender or genderless (postgender, <b>agender),</b> between genders (intergender), moving across genders (genderfluid), or simultaneously exhibiting multiple genders (pangender). Limited forms of androgyny are common (women wearing pants, men wearing earrings) and are not seen as transgender behavior. Androgyne is also sometimes used as a medical synonym for an intersex person. Genderqueer identities are independent of sexual orientation.|$|E
5000|$|One such way is {{to replace}} gender-specific word endings -o and -a by an -x, which {{represents}} the syllable [...] "ex" [...] (such as in Latinx, pronounced as [...] "la-TEEN-ex", as opposed to Latino and Latina). It is more inclusive in genderqueer-friendly environments than the at-sign, given the existence of gender identities like <b>agender</b> and demigender and/or the existence of gender-abolitionist people. (The latter are different from <b>agender</b> people in that their reasons to not adopt any gender are based on ideology rather than inner identity.) One argument is that the at-sign and related symbols {{are based on the}} idea that there is a gender binary, instead of trying to break away with this construct, among others.|$|E
