40|$|Abstract The {{division}} of the auditory cortex into various ®elds, functional aspects of these ®elds, and neuronal coding in the primary auditory cortical ®eld (AI) are reviewed with stress on features that may be common to mammals. On the basis of 14 topographies and clustered distributions of neuronal response characteristics in the primary auditory cortical ®eld, a hypothesis is developed of how a certain complex acoustic pattern may be encoded in an equivalent spatial activity pattern in AI, generated by time-coordinated ®ring of groups of neurons. The auditory cortex, demonstrated speci®cally for AI, appears to perform sound analysis by synthesis, i. e. by combining spatially distributed coincident or timecoordinated neuronal responses.

A new sufficient condition for convergence of Jackoby’s method for solving systems of linear equations for which the matrix of coefficients has a slightly dominant principal diagonal is proved. Theorem of O. Taussky [1]. Let matrix D of n-th order satisfy the following conditions: (i) D is irreducible; (ii) D has a slightly dominant principal diagonal, i. e.

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of topological insulators {{is based on}} an underlying crystalline lattice where the local electronic degrees of freedom at different sites hybridize with each other in ways that produce nontrivial band topology, and the search for material systems to realize such phases have been strongly influenced by this. Here we theoretically demonstrate topological insulators in systems with a random distribution of sites in space, i. e., a random lattice. This is achieved by constructing hopping models on random lattices whose ground states possess nontrivial topological nature (characterized e. g., by Bott indices) that manifests as quantized conductances in systems with a boundary. By tuning parameters such as the density of sites (for a given range of fermion hopping), we can achieve transitions from trivial to topological phases. We discuss interesting features of these transitions. In two spatial dimensions, we show this for all five symmetry classes (<b>A,</b> <b>AII,</b> D, DIII and C) that are known to host nontrivial topology in crystalline systems. We expect similar physics to be realizable in any dimension and provide an explicit example of a $Z_ 2 $ topological insulator on a random lattice in three spatial dimensions.

40|$|The {{high-resolution}} 3 D {{structure of}} the octapeptide hormone angiotensin II (AII) in aqueous solution has been obtained by simulated annealing calculations, using high-resolution NMR-derived restraints. After final refinement in explicit water, a family of 13 structures was obtained with a backbone RMSD of 0. 73 ± 0. 23 <b>Å.</b> <b>AII</b> adopts a fairly compact folded structure, with its C-terminus and N-terminus approaching to within ≈ 7. 2 Å of each other. The side chains of Arg 2, Tyr 4, Ile 5 and His 6 are oriented {{on one side of}} a plane defined by the peptide backbone, and the Val 3 and Pro 7 are pointing in opposite directions. The stabilization of the folded conformation {{can be explained by the}} stacking of the Val 3 side chain with the Pro 7 ring and by a hydrophobic cluster formed by the Tyr 4, Ile 5 and His 6 side chains. Comparison between the NMR-derived structure of AII in aqueous solution and the refined crystal {{structure of the}} complex of AII with a high-affinity mAb (Fab 131) [Garcia, K. C., Ronco, P. M., Verroust, P. J., Brunger, A. T., Amzel, L. M. (1992) Science 257, 502 – 507] provides important quantitative information on two common structural features: (a) a U-shaped structure of the Tyr 4 -Ile 5 -His 6 -Pro 7 sequence, which is the most immunogenic epitope of the peptide, with the Asp 1 side chain oriented towards the interior of the turn approaching the C-terminus; (b) an Asx-turn-like motif with the side chain aspartate carboxyl group hydrogen-bonded to the main chain NH group of Arg 2. It can be concluded that small rearrangements of the epitope 4 – 7 in the solution structure of AII are required by a mean value of 0. 76 ± 0. 03 Å for structure alignment and ≈ 1. 27 ± 0. 02 Å for sequence alignment with the X-ray structure of AII bound to the mAb Fab 131.

Design/methodology/approach: A survey study was conducted using a national sample of US AIIs. Based on these firms' executives' responses, a firm identity issue was analyzed and a detailed profile of these firms' business characteristics was developed, using frequency comparisons. Findings: The study confirmed that US AIIs are currently experiencing an identity crisis, as nearly half of the study respondents misclassified themselves as apparel manufacturers or other business types, suggesting a significant distortion in US Economic Census data. The study also provided a descriptive profile of US AIIs, including geographic location and other business operation characteristics. Research limitations/implications: Three fourths of the survey respondents were located in the state of New York. Whether most US AIIs truly reside in New York cannot be known with certainty. Generalization of the study findings to a greater population should be cautious. Practical implications: Confirmation of <b>an</b> <b>AII</b> identity crisis suggests both aggregate and individual firm-level impacts on import activities. The study offers a new term, "intermediary", to replace the US Census Bureau term "wholesaler" to accurately reflect the industry's transformation.

In this study, we show that the octapeptide hormone angiotensin II (AII), apparently acting through the AT 1 G-protein-coupled receptor, is also a mitogen for RIE- 1 cells. Maximal stimulation of DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation occurred at <b>an</b> <b>AII</b> concentration of 10 - 100 nM, with half-maximal stimulation at 1 nM.

The early signalling responses activated by AII in RIE- 1 cells include increased production of inositol phosphates, a transient increase in the intracellular concentration of free calcium, an activation of protein kinase C, and a rapid change in the pattern of cellular protein-tyrosine phosphorylation.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) {{has been}} {{proposed}} to modulate the renal response to protein as well as basal renal hemodynamics. We investigated whether NO and angiotensin II (AII) interact to control glomerular hemodynamics and absolute proximal tubular reabsorption (APR) during glycine infusion and in unstimulated conditions. In control rats, glycine increased single nephron GFR and plasma flow with no change in APR. The NO synthase blocker, NG-monomethyl L-arginine (LNMMA), abolished the vasodilatory response to glycine, possibly through activation of tubuloglomerular feedback due to a decrease in APR produced by LNMMA + glycine. Pretreatment with <b>an</b> <b>AII</b> receptor antagonist, DuP 753, normalized the response to glycine at both glomerular and tubular levels. In unstimulated conditions, LNMMA produced glomerular arteriolar vasoconstriction, decreased the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient, and reduced single nephron GFR. These changes were associated with a striking decrease in APR. DuP 753 prevented both glomerular and tubular changes induced by LNMMA. In conclusion, NO represents a physiological antagonist of AII at both the glomerulus and tubule in both the basal state and during glycine infusion; and inhibition of NO apparently enhances or uncovers the inhibitory effect of AII on proximal reabsorption...|$|R

In order to develop such a system, three crystal structures of designed armadillo-repeat proteins with third-generation N-caps (YIII-type), four or five internal repeats (M-type) and second-generation C-caps (AII-type) were determined at 1. 8 <b>Å</b> (His-YIIIM 4 <b>AII),</b> 2. 0 <b>Å</b> (His-YIIIM 5 <b>AII)</b> and 1. 95 <b>Å</b> (YIIIM 5 <b>AII)</b> resolution and compared with those of variants with third-generation C-caps. All constructs are full consensus designs in which the internal repeats have exactly the same sequence, and hence identical conformations of the internal repeats are expected. The N-cap and internal repeats M 1 to M 3 are indeed extremely similar, but the comparison reveals structural differences in internal repeats M 4 and M 5 and the C-cap. These differences are caused by long-range effects of the C-cap, contacting molecules in the crystal, and the intrinsic design of the repeat. Unfortunately, the rigid-body movement of the C-terminal part impairs the regular arrangement of internal repeats that forms the putative peptide-binding site. The second-generation C-cap improves the packing of buried residues and thereby the stability of the protein. These considerations are useful for future improvements of an armadillo-repeat-based peptide-recognition system...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRetinal {{ganglion}} {{cells in}} the cat respond to single rhodopsin isomerizations with one to three spikes. This quantal signal is transmitted in the retina by the rod bipolar pathway: rod→rod bipolar→AII→cone bipolar→ganglion cell. The two-dimensional circuit underlying this pathway includes extensive convergence from rods to <b>an</b> <b>AII</b> amacrine cell, divergence from a rod to several AII and ganglion cells, and coupling between the AII amacrine cells. In this study we explored the function of coupling by reconstructing several AII amacrine cells and the gap junctions between them from electron micrographs; and simulating the AII network with and without coupling. The simulation showed that coupling in the AII network can: (1) improve the signal/noise ratio in the AII network; (2) improve the signal/noise ratio for a single rhodopsin isomerization striking in {{the periphery of the}} ganglion cell receptive field center, and therefore in most ganglion cells responding to a single isomerization; (3) expand the AII and ganglion cells' receptive field center; and (4) expand the “correlation field”. All of these effects have one major outcome: an increase in correlation between ganglion cell activity. Well correlated activity between the ganglion cells could improve the brain's ability to discriminate few absorbed external photons from the high background of spontaneous thermal isomerizations. Based on the possible benefits of coupling in the AII network, we suggest that coupling occurs at low scotopic luminances. Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} whether angiotensin II (AII) {{is able to}} induce insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS- 1) phosphorylation and its association with phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase) in the rat heart in vivo. The phosphorylation state of IRS- 1 following infusion of insulin or AII via the vena cava was assessed after immunoprecipitation with an anti-peptide antibody to IRS- 1 followed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and an anti-PI 3 -kinase antibody. Densitometry indicated a 5. 6 +/- 1. 3 -fold increase in IRS- 1 phosphorylation after stimulation with <b>AII</b> and <b>a</b> 12. 8 +/- 3. 1 -fold increase after insulin. The effect was maximal at <b>an</b> <b>AII</b> concentration of 10 (- 8) M and occurred 1 min after infusion. There was also a 6. 1 +/- 1. 2 -fold increase in IRS- 1 -associated PI 3 -kinase in response to AII. In the isolated perfused heart the result was similar, showing a direct effect of AII on this pathway. When the animals were pretreated for 1 h with DuP 753, a non-peptide AII-receptor 1 (AT 1 receptor) antagonist, there was a marked reduction in the AII-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS- 1, suggesting that phosphorylation is initially mediated by the AT 1 receptor. We conclude that AII stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS- 1 and its association with PI 3 -kinase. This pathway thus represents an additional signalling mechanism stimulated by AII in the rat heart in vivo...|$|R

40|$|Background: Accurate {{reconstruction}} of the morphology of single neurons is important for morphometric studies and for developing compartmental models. However, manual morphological reconstruction can be extremely time-consuming and error-prone and algorithms for automatic reconstruction can be challenged when applied to neurons with a high density of extensively branching processes. New method: We present a procedure for semi-automatic reconstruction specifically adapted for densely branching neurons such as the AII amacrine cell found in mammalian retinas. We used whole-cell recording to fill AII amacrine cells in rat retinal slices with fluorescent dyes and acquired digital image stacks with multi-photon excitation microscopy. Our reconstruction algorithm combines elements of existing procedures, with segmentation based on adaptive thresholding and reconstruction based on a minimal spanning tree. We improved this workflow with an algorithm that reconnects neuron segments that are disconnected after adaptive thresholding, using paths extracted from the image stacks with the Fast Marching method. Results: By reducing the likelihood that disconnected segments were incorrectly connected to neighboring segments, our procedure generated excellent morphological reconstructions of AII amacrine cells. Comparison with existing methods: Reconstructing <b>an</b> <b>AII</b> amacrine cell required about 2 h computing time, compared to 2 – 4 days for manual reconstruction. To evaluate the performance of our method relative to manual reconstruction, we performed detailed analysis using a measure of tree structure similarity (DIADEM score), the degree of projection area overlap (Dice coefficient), and branch statistics. Conclusions: We expect our procedure to be generally useful for morphological {{reconstruction of}} neurons filled with fluorescent dyes. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{cortisol}} on {{blood pressure and}} the circulating components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) were investigated in sheep fetuses during late gestation and after exogenous cortisol infusion. Plasma cortisol concentration was greater in fetuses at 140 ± 1 days of gestation (term 145 ± 2 days) compared to those studied earlier in gestation (128 ± 1 days), although, because of wide inter-animal variation, no differences were observed in blood pressure or plasma angiotensin II (AII), renin or angiotensinogen (Ao) concentrations. At 129 ± 1 days of gestation, an infusion of cortisol for 5 days (2 - 3 mg kg− 1 day− 1 i. v.) increased plasma cortisol concentration to a value normally seen close to term. This rise in plasma cortisol was accompanied by increases in blood pressure and plasma concentrations of AII, renin and Ao. When observations from all fetuses were considered, plasma cortisol concentration correlated with plasma AII and renin, and blood pressure correlated with plasma cortisol and AII concentrations. Intravenous administration of <b>an</b> <b>AII</b> type 1 (AT 1) -specific receptor antagonist (3 mg kg− 1 GR 138950) caused a reduction in blood pressure in all fetuses; the hypotensive response was greatest in fetuses studied near term and in the cortisol-treated fetuses.

Also, renin-LIR was retained in these cultures. As shown by double immunostaining of paraffin-embedded sections of the aggregates, this AII-LIR was localized only in gonadotrophs. AII-LIR {{was detected}} at least up to 5 weeks in culture. On reversed-phase, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), this AII-LIR co-migrated with authentic AII. In perifused aggregate cell cultures of 15 - to 20 -day-old female rat pituitary maintained in serum-free medium supplemented with dexamethasone (DEX) and triiodothyronine (T 3), AII stimulated GH release. AI and AIII had a similar effect. To evaluate the possible involvement of endogenous AII in the local regulation of GH release, gonadotrophs were stimulated with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH). LHRH displayed a transient inhibitory effect on GH release, which {{was followed by a}} rebound of GH release after withdrawal of the peptide. Treatment of aggregates with pertussis toxin reversed this inhibitory effect into a significant stimulation of GH release.

The effect of LHRH on GH release in aggregates cultured either in serum-free medium supplemented with DEX and T 3 or in serum-supplemented medium was not affected by (Sar 1,Ala 8) AII, not even after enhancing the LHRH-induced GH release by treatment of the aggregates with pertussis toxin. A hundred times lower concentration of (Sar 1,Ala 8) AII, however, abolished the AII-induced changes in GH release. Also DUP 753 (10 microM) failed to block LHRH-induced GH release in aggregates. (Sar 1,Ala 8) AII also failed to block the effect of LHRH on GH release from hemipituitaries. It is concluded that LHRH has inhibitory and stimulatory effects on GH release in cultured pituitary cell aggregates. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that the hypertension associated with insulin resistance is secondary to an altered responsiveness of the vasculature to pressor agents, we evaluated the relationship between insulin resistance and pressor responses to angiotensin II (AII) in 21 hypertensive (HT) and 8 normotensive (NT) subjects on both a high (200 meq) and a low (10 meq) sodium diet. When sodium balance was achieved, each supine fasting subject underwent <b>an</b> <b>AII</b> infusion at <b>a</b> rate of 3 ng/kg per min for 60 min, with blood pressure monitored every 2 min. On the next day under similar conditions, a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp was performed, with plasma glucose clamped at 90 mg/dl for 120 min. There was no significant relationship between the glucose disposal rate (M) or the insulin sensitivity index (M divided by the mean insulin level [M/I]) and blood pressure response to AII in the NTs, but a highly significant (P < 0. 019) negative correlation (r = - 0. 55) in the HTs. Furthermore, in eight lean HTs whose body mass index was identical to that observed in the NTs, the relationship was even more striking (P < 0. 008; r = - 0. 85). The results on high and low salt diets were similar; however, the M and M/I were significantly increased (P < 0. 05) in the NTs but not HTs with sodium restriction. In conclusion, HTs but not NTs display a striking correlation between pressor response to AII and insulin resistance. This relationship is independent of the level of sodium intake. Furthermore, sodium intake modifies insulin sensitivity in NTs but not HTs. These results strongly suggest that a primary change in pressor response to vasoactive agents in insulin-resistant subjects can contribute to their elevated blood pressure...|$|R
40|$|Addison 2 ̆ 7 s {{disease may}} be {{complicated}} by hypertension and less commonly by heart failure. We review the pathophysiology of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis in Addison 2 ̆ 7 s disease {{and how this}} is altered {{in the setting of}} hypertension and heart failure. An essential first step in management in both conditions is optimizing glucocorticoid replacement and considering dose reduction if excessive. Following this, if a patient with Addison 2 ̆ 7 s disease remains hypertensive, the fludrocortisone dose should be reviewed and reduced if there are clinical and/or biochemical signs of mineralocorticoid excess. In the absence of such signs, where the renin is towards {{the upper end of the}} normal range or elevated, <b>an</b> angiotensin II (<b>AII)</b> receptor antagonist or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is the treatment of choice, and the fludrocortisone dose should remain unchanged. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are clinically useful as second line agents, but diuretics should be avoided. In the setting of heart failure, there is an increase in total body sodium and water; therefore, it is appropriate to reduce and rarely consider ceasing the fludrocortisone. Loop diuretics may be used, but not aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone or eplerenone. Standard treatment with ACE inhibitors, or as <b>an</b> alternative, <b>AII</b> receptor antagonists, are appropriate. Measurements of renin are no longer helpful in heart failure to determine the volume status but plasma levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP/proBNP) may help guide therapy...|$|R
40|$|Angiotensin II antagonists (AIIAs) were {{introduced}} to treat hypertension about 10 years ago.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of spironolactone on neurohormonal factors in patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF). BACKGROUND: In the Randomized ALdactone Evaluation Study (RALES), spironolactone, an aldosterone receptor antagonist, significantly reduced mortality in patients with severe CHF. However, the mechanism of action and neurohormonal impact of this therapy remain to be clarified. METHODS: The effects of spironolactone (25 mg/day; n = 54) or placebo (n = 53) on plasma concentrations of the N-terminal portion of atrial natriuretic factor (N-proANF), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), endothelin- 1 (ET- 1), norepinephrine (NE), angiotensin II (AII), and aldosterone were assessed in a subgroup of 107 patients (New York Heart Association functional class III to IV; mean ejection fraction 25 %) at study entry and at three and six months. RESULTS: Compared with the placebo group, plasma levels of BNP (- 23 % at 3 and 6 months; p = 0. 004 and p = 0. 05, respectively) and N-proANF (- 19 % at 3 months, p = 0. 03; - 16 % at 6 months, p = 0. 11) were decreased after spironolactone treatment. Over time, spironolactone did not modify the plasma levels of NE and ET- 1. Angiotensin II increased significantly in the spironolactone group at three and six months (p = 0. 003 and p = 0. 001, respectively). As expected, {{a significant increase in}} aldosterone levels was observed over time in the spironolactone group (p = 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Spironolactone administration in patients with CHF has opposite effects on circulating levels of natriuretic peptides (which decrease) and aldosterone and AII (which increase). The reduction in natriuretic peptides might be related to changes in left ventricular diastolic filling pressure and/or compliance, whereas the increase in AII and aldosterone probably reflects activated feedback mechanisms. Further studies are needed to link these changes to the beneficial effects on survival and to determine whether the addition of <b>an</b> <b>AII</b> antagonist could be useful in this setting...|$|R

40|$|Salt loading {{decreases}} body {{core temperature}} (Tcore) at neutral ambient temperature (26 °C) and increases heat-escape/cold-seeking behaviour in desalivated rats. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that brain angiotensin II (AII) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are associated with these responses. Surgically desalivated rats (n = 28) were administered an injection (s. c., 10 ml kg− 1) of either normal saline (154 mm, NS) or hypertonic saline (2500 mm, HS) following an intracerebroventricular injection (10 μl kg− 1) of <b>an</b> <b>AII</b> AT 1 -receptor antagonist (candesartan, 5 μg μl− 1), an AVP V 1 -receptor antagonist ((β-mercapto-β, β-cyclopenta-methylene propionyl 1, O-Me-Tyr 2, Arg 8) -vasopressin, 0. 5 μg μl− 1), or normal saline (154 mm). Each rat {{was placed in a}} behaviour box, first at 26 °C for 1 h to allow the measurement of baseline Tcore and movement. The ambient temperature was then elevated to 40 °C for the next 2 h, during which time the rat was able to trigger a 0 °C air reward for 30 s by moving into a specific area of the box (operant behaviour). The s. c. HS significantly decreased baseline Tcore at 26 °C (36. 5 ± 0. 1 °C) and increased counts of operant behaviour at 40 °C (57 ± 3) compared with results obtained following s. c. NS injection (37. 4 ± 0. 1 °C and 42 ± 1, respectively). These responses to s. c. HS were inhibited by the intracerebroventricular injection of AT 1 (37. 3 ± 0. 1 °C and 43 ± 2, respectively; P < 0. 05) and V 1 antagonists (37. 2 ± 0. 2 °C and 42 ± 2, respectively; P < 0. 05), although administration of both antagonists with s. c. NS had no effect. These results suggest that brain AII and AVP are involved in the decrease in Tcore observed at neutral ambient temperature and the increase in heat-escape/cold-seeking behaviour in response to osmotic stimulation, via the central AT 1 and V 1 receptors, respectivel...|$|R
