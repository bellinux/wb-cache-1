5|$|Seeking a model {{agricultural}} college, Mori Arinori, the Japanese Minister to the United States, asked Horace Capron, Commissioner of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, for a recommendation.

5|$|Britain's {{enemies in}} {{continental}} Europe had long recognised Ireland as a weak point in Britain's defences. Landing troops {{there was a}} popular strategic goal, not only because an invader could expect {{the support of a}} large proportion of the native population, but also because at least initially they would face fewer and less reliable troops than elsewhere in the British Isles. Additionally, embroiling the British Army in a protracted Irish campaign would reduce its availability for other theatres of war. Finally, French planners considered that a successful invasion of Ireland might act <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> platform for a subsequent invasion of Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|For {{the role}} of Apu, Ray advertised in {{newspapers}} for boys of ages five to seven. None of the candidates who auditioned fulfilled Ray's expectations, but his wife spotted a boy in their neighbourhood, and this boy, Subir Banerjee, was cast as Apu. (The surname {{of three of the}} main actors happened to be Banerjee, but they were not related to each other). The hardest role to fill was the wizened old Indir. Ray eventually found Chunibala Devi, a retired stage actress living in one of Calcutta's red-light districts, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> candidate. Several minor roles were played by the villagers of Boral, where Pather Panchali was filmed.|$|E
5|$|Her {{death was}} widely publicised shortly {{afterwards}} by the Polish press, which contributed to her growing fame. Plater {{became one of}} the symbols of the uprising. The symbol of the fighting girl became quite widespread both in Poland, Lithuania and abroad. Mickiewicz immortalized her in his poem, Śmierć pułkownika (Death of a Colonel), although the description of her death is a pure poetical fiction and was only loosely based on her real life. Mickiewicz has also idealized her personality and skills, portraying her <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> commander, worshiped by her soldiers. That poem has entered the elementary curriculum in the independent Poland.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, the MTO {{began an}} {{environmental}} assessment {{into a new}} alignment for the northern connection with the Queensway. It was approved in mid-1987, with Cedarview Drive chosen <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> alignment for the new freeway. The MTO set out to design a four-lane route to connect the Queensway with Highway16 New, including a three-level free-flow interchange. A contract for construction of this interchange was awarded in late 1989 and construction began in 1990. During the 1991 construction season, contracts were awarded to construct several overpasses along the new route.|$|E

50|$|At {{that time}} the Nawab was {{teaching}} not only acting {{to the children of}} his troupe but also taught them languages, literature, and music.

5|$|In the {{northwest}} corner of the Khilawat Khana stands the Kala Burj ("Black Pavilion"). The pavilion is the most significant of the Jahangir-era additions to the Lahore Fort. The vaulted ceilings in the pavilion feature paintings in a European-influenced style of angels which symbolize the virtuosity of King Solomon, who is regarded <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> ruler in the Quran, and a ruler with whom Jahangir identified. Angels directing djinns are also painted on tiles in the ceiling, which also reference King Solomon. Kala Burj was used as a summer pavilion.|$|E
5|$|While in {{the eastern}} provinces, he came into {{conflict}} with the governor of Syria, Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso.

As a famous general, he was widely popular and regarded <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> Roman long after his death. To the Roman people, Germanicus was the Roman equivalent of Alexander the Great {{due to the nature of}} his death at a young age, his virtuous character, his dashing physique, and his military renown.|$|E
5|$|In April 1998, Wooller {{claimed that}} the council of the ICAEW was obstructing his {{campaign}} to increase democracy after it refused to allow the original text of motions that were to be published to be heard at the annual general meeting in June 1998. Wooller's first motion was about electing {{the president of the}} ICAEW democratically by ballot. The other two motions came about from the Gerrard report. The second motion said the district societies should be self-financing and the third motion was on reducing the number of council members to fifty-three. The first motion used a quotation from an Accountancy Age interview with council member Ian Hay Davison, and Wooller was told to stop circulating Hay Davison's quotation after he objected to being quoted. The ICAEW asked members to vote on {{an increase in the number}} of council members from seventy-five after requests made in the Gerrard report. Wooller asked members to reduce the number of council members to fifty-three, which was recommended by the Gerrard report <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> council quota. A 54% majority of the ICAEW members supported Wooller's motion to reduce the number.|$|E

5|$|In England cannon {{were being}} used to besiege various {{fortified}} buildings during the English Civil War. Nathaniel Nye is recorded as testing a Birmingham cannon in 1643 and experimenting with a saker in 1645. From 1645 he was the master gunner to the Parliamentarian garrison at Evesham and in 1646 he successfully directed the artillery at the Siege of Worcester, detailing his experiences and in his 1647 book The Art of Gunnery. Believing that war {{was as much a}} science as an art, his explanations focused on triangulation, arithmetic, theoretical mathematics, and cartography as well as practical considerations such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> specification for gunpowder or slow matches. His book acknowledged mathematicians such as Robert Recorde and Marcus Jordanus as well as earlier military writers on artillery such as Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia and Thomas (or Francis) Malthus (author of A Treatise on Artificial Fire-Works).|$|E
5|$|In the Orange Free State President Brand {{was one of}} the {{politicians}} who held on to a more cautious and consolidating policy towards the British government at the Cape, maintaining strict neutrality. In this position Brand followed the habit of a lifetime, and it earned him a British knighthood. Despite the changing political climate and the polarisation of political positions, Brand remained hugely popular with the burghers of the Orange Free State. The presidential elections of 1883 could on content have become a political battle between the pan-Dutch Afrikaner Bond supporters and followers of the Brand-line. However, Reitz, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> pan-Dutch candidate, again refused to stand against Brand. Only when Brand died in office five years later, the time was ripe for change. Reitz stood candidate and won a landslide victory on the ticket of Afrikaner nationalism. He was inaugurated as state president in the Tweetoringkerk (Two-Towers Church) in Bloemfontein on 10 January 1889.|$|E
5|$|The Hanada {{family had}} {{generally}} received very positive press coverage while Takanohana and Wakanohana were active wrestlers, {{with the press}} holding them up <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> Japanese family and tending to ignore any splits between them. Their different attitudes towards both sumo philosophy and the outside world had been noted, with Takanohana being regarded as somewhat aloof and reserved and Wakanahona having a warmer personality. However, upon their father's death from cancer in May 2005, a bitter rift between the brothers was widely reported in the Japanese media. Takanohana felt he should be the chief mourner at the funeral as he had remained in the Sumo Association whilst his brother had left to become a TV celebrity, but the role went to Wakanohana as the elder brother, as is traditional.|$|E

5|$|The {{state of}} Kerala is often viewed <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> {{progressive}} {{leader in the}} women’s rights movement in India among states. Kerala maintains very high relative levels of female literacy and women’s health, as well as greater female inheritance and property rights. For example, a 1998 study conducted by Bina Agarwal found that while only 13% of all women in India with landowning fathers inherited that land as daughters, 24% of such women {{were able to do}} so in the state of Kerala. This is important because it has been shown that measures to improve such access to property and economic independence through channels such as education not only directly improve women’s wellbeing and capabilities, but also reduce their risk of exposure to marital or any sort of domestic violence.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only was}} the supply of {{available}} aircraft poor, by the then Director of Organisation at the Air Ministry Charles Portal recognised {{there would be a}} future problem in procurement of aircraft. Coastal Command's operational nature would make twenty-four hour operations a basic requirement. Suitable aircraft for take-off and landing, in particular flying-boats, in all weather was vital for the safety of crews and the effectiveness of the Command. The new twin-engine Saro Lerwick had been touted <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> aircraft. It only came into service in April 1939 and was then found to be unsuitable. There was a need for long-range machines to cover the South-Western Approaches. In December 1939 to August 1940 the following reinforcements were sent: No. 10 Squadron RAAF received Sunderlands, No. 235 Squadron RAF, No. 236 Squadron RAF, No. 248 Squadron RAF and No. 254 Squadron RAF equipped with Bristol Blenheims from RAF Fighter Command in February 1940; in June 1940 No. 53 Squadron RAF and No. 59 Squadron RAFs with Blenheim on loan from RAF Bomber Command, and in August 1940, No. 98 Squadron RAF's Fairey Battles, also on loan from the Bomber Service and based in Iceland. By 15 June a further 15 squadrons were to have been handed over to Coastal Command, this was only achieved by the loan of seven squadrons from other commands, despite express agreement by the Air Ministry and Admiralty. The daily operational strength of Coastal Command amounted to 298 aircraft, most unsuitable for maritime operations. Within a month, that had risen to 39 squadrons and 612 aircraft. However they were made of 11 different types, causing training and conversion problems.|$|E

25|$|Another {{criticism}} of postcolonial literature {{is that by}} focusing much on the distinct culture of the colonized, it seems to ignore the vast human rights violation {{that many of the}} cultural practices contain in them. Culture cannot be unquestionable as there are universal human rights, which should be respected, and to term everything that has emerged in <b>the</b> West, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideals</b> of liberty, <b>as</b> a negative colonial legacy, is a far-fetched proposition.|$|R
