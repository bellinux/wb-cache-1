5|$|At {{least two}} species of bird lice, Colpocephalum cooki and Ciconiphilus temporalis have been found as ectoparasites. Healthy adult birds have no natural predators, and the only {{recorded}} causes of premature mortality are due to the direct or indirect actions of humans; such as, poisoning, shooting, or electrocution when the birds accidentally fly into overhead electricity wires. Captive birds {{have been found to}} be susceptible to <b>avian</b> <b>influenza</b> (H5N1) and high mortality was noted at a facility in Cambodia, with two-thirds of infected birds dying. The longest recorded life span in captivity was 43 years.|$|E

50|$|Scientists {{screened}} 104,000 peripheral-blood {{plasma cells}} from eight recently infected or vaccinated donors for antibodies that recognize {{each of three}} diverse influenza strains: H1N1 (swine-origin) and H5N1 and H7N7 (highly pathogenic <b>avian</b> <b>influenzas.)</b> From one donor, they isolated four plasma cells that produced an identical antibody, which they called FI6.This antibody binds all 16 HA subtypes, neutralizes infection, and protects mice and ferrets from lethal infection. The most broadly reactive antibodies {{that had previously been}} discovered recognized either one group of HA subtypes or the other, highlighting how remarkable FI6 is in its ability to target the gamut of influenza subtypes.|$|R

5|$|Both {{intensive}} and free-range farming have animal welfare concerns. In intensive systems, cannibalism, feather pecking and vent pecking can be common, with some farmers using beak trimming as a preventative measure. Diseases {{can also be}} common and spread rapidly through the flock. In extensive systems, the birds are exposed to adverse weather conditions and are vulnerable to predators and disease-carrying wild birds. Barn systems {{have been found to}} have the worst bird welfare. In Southeast Asia, a lack of disease control in free-range farming has been associated with outbreaks of <b>avian</b> <b>influenza.</b>|$|E
5|$|In general, <b>avian</b> <b>{{influenza}}</b> is {{a disease}} of birds caused by bird-specific influenza A virus that is not normally transferred to people; however, people in contact with live poultry are at the greatest risk of becoming infected with the virus and this is of particular concern {{in areas such as}} Southeast Asia, where the disease is endemic in the wild bird population and domestic poultry can become infected. The virus possibly could mutate to become highly virulent and infectious in humans and cause an influenza pandemic.|$|E

The infection affected poultry at one of Bernard Matthews' farms in Holton in Suffolk. It was the third instance of H5N1-subtype detected in the United Kingdom {{and a range of}} precautions were instituted to prevent spread of the disease including a large cull of turkeys, the imposition of segregation zones, and a disinfection programme for the plant.|$|E

5|$|Examples {{of common}} human {{diseases}} caused by viruses include the common cold, influenza, chickenpox, and cold sores. Many serious {{diseases such as}} Ebola virus disease, AIDS, <b>avian</b> <b>influenza,</b> and SARS are caused by viruses. The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is {{described in terms of}} virulence. Other diseases are under investigation to discover if they have a virus as the causative agent, such as the possible connection between human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) and neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome. There is controversy over whether the bornavirus, previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans.|$|E
5|$|External parasites include chewing lice of {{the genus}} Saemundssonia, feather lice and fleas such as Ceratophyllus borealis. Lice are often host specific, and the closely related common and Arctic terns carry quite {{different}} species. Internal parasites include the crustacean Reighardia sternae, and tapeworms such as Ligula intestinalis {{and members of the}} genera Diphyllobothrium and Schistocephalus. Terns are normally free of blood parasites, unlike gulls that often carry Haemoproteus species. An exception is the brown noddy, which sometimes harbours protozoa of that genus. In 1961 the common tern was the first wild bird species identified as being infected with <b>avian</b> <b>influenza,</b> the H5N3 variant being found in an outbreak involving South African birds. Several species of terns have been implicated as carriers of West Nile virus.|$|E
5|$|The {{migration}} of birds also aids {{the movement of}} other species, including those of ectoparasites such as ticks and lice, which in turn may carry micro-organisms including those of concern to human health. Due to the global spread of <b>avian</b> <b>influenza,</b> bird migration has been studied as a possible mechanism of disease transmission, {{but it has been}} found not to present a special risk; import of pet and domestic birds is a greater threat. Some viruses that are maintained in birds without lethal effects, such as the West Nile Virus may however be spread by migrating birds. Birds may also have a role in the dispersal of propagules of plants and plankton.|$|E

40|$|Aquatic {{birds are}} the natural {{reservoirs}} {{of a wide}} variety of influenza A viruses. Novel influenza strains occasionally emerge from wild bird populations and spread to other species. Historically, pandemic influenza strains crossing over to humans have led to serious outbreaks. The rapid evolution of influenza strains in birds presents a major public health concern. Globalization and intensified agriculture have increased human contact with <b>avian</b> <b>influenzas</b> in the past century. Antiviral drugs effective against influenza are an important part of preparing for outbreaks, as well as common seasonal flu’s. Two major classes of antiviral drugs widely used against influenza are M 2 inhibitors and neuraminidase inhibitors. The M 2 inhibitor amantadine was approved by the FDA in 1966. More than 30 years later the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir was approved for use against the flu in 1999, marketed as Tamiflu®. Unfortunately, flu viruses are highly mutable and can quickly develop resistance to treatment. Resistance has been observed to both amantadine and oseltamivir, with resistance to amantadine especially widespread since its introduction 50 years ago. Monitoring levels of drug sensitivity in natural flu strains collected from the wild is one way to understand how different strains are affected by antiviral drugs and how resistance spreads...|$|R
