40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} a two species prey-predator model is {{developed}} in which prey is wildebeest and predator is lion {{and both are}} threatened by poaching, drought and diseases. The system {{is found in the}} Serengeti ecosystem. The model is constructed based on Holling type II functional response incorporating a constant prey refuge. We apply optimal control theory to investigate optimal strategies for controlling the threats in the system where anti-poaching patrols are used for controlling poaching, construction of dams for mitigating drought and vaccination for diseases control. The possible impact of using combinations of three controls either one at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> at a time on the threatened system plus a refuge factor is examined. All control strategies have shown significant increase in prey and predator populations. However, the best result is achieved by controlling all threats together. The effect of variation of prey refuge m to the control of threats is studied and results indicate that increase of m causes more prey individuals to be saved and reduces the number of predator individuals saved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An o �-nadir canopy re ¯ ectance model, the Liang and Strahler {{algorithm}} for the Coupled Atmosphere and Canopy (CAC) model, {{was used}} to simulate multi-angle re ¯ ectances based on various combinations of canopy biophysical parameters. Biophysical parameters such as leaf angle distribution (LAD) and leaf area index (LAI) were input to the CAC model along with re ¯ ectances of leaf and soil and aerosol optical depth. The CAC model, however, can only be inverted through numerical iterations and it is extremely di � cult to use for retrieval of those biophysical parameters with ordinary inversion methods. In order to retrieve those biophysical parameters, we employed an error backpropagation feed-forward neural network program. We constructed a number of neural network models based on the simulated results from the CAC model. In this paper, we report the results obtained from retrieving any individual parameter from multi-angle re ¯ ectances and results obtained from simultaneously retrieving some combinations of two parameters and ® ve parameters. We tested {{the use of a}} di � erent number of multi-angle re ¯ ectances as input to the neural networks. This number varied in the range 1 ± 64. The test results showed that a relative error between 1 and 5 % or better was achievable for retrieving one parameter at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> parameters simultaneously. The relative errors for two of the ® ve simultaneously retrieved parameters were less than 17 %. The amount of computation required by simultaneous retrieval of ® ve parameters was prohibitively high for a regular workstation. 1...|$|E
