5|$|The normal {{progress}} for an able Magister {{was to go}} on to further study in one of the four faculties at Leuven: Theology, Medicine, Canon Law and Roman Law. Gisbert might have hoped that Mercator would go further in theology and train for the priesthood but Mercator did not: like many twenty year old young men he was having his first serious doubts. The problem was the contradiction between the authority of Aristotle and his own biblical study and scientific observations, particularly in relation to the creation and description of the world. Such doubt was heresy at the University and {{it is quite possible that}} he had <b>already</b> <b>said</b> enough in classroom disputations to come to the notice of the authorities: fortunately he did not put his sentiments into print. He left Leuven for Antwerp, there to devote his time to contemplation of philosophy. This period of his life is clouded in uncertainty. He certainly read widely but only succeeded in uncovering more contradictions between the world of the Bible and the world of geography, a hiatus which would occupy him for the rest of his life. He certainly could not effect a reconciliation between his studies and the world of Aristotle.|$|E

25|$|In {{these two}} centuries the ecclesiastical {{authorities}} were quite active {{in their efforts}} to withstand the decay of Christian discipline; the evidence of this is seen in the frequency of councils, mixed assemblies of bishops and imperial officials and diocesan synods whose decrees (capitularies) were often published by the bishops. In this period many new collections of canons were made, some forty of which, as <b>already</b> <b>said,</b> are known to us.|$|E

25|$|To {{say that}} the {{intention}} of the instrument must prevail; that this intention must be collected from its words; that its words are to be understood in that sense in which they are generally used by those for whom the instrument was intended; that its provisions are neither to be restricted into insignificance, nor extended to objects not comprehended in them, nor contemplated by its framers—is to repeat what has been <b>already</b> <b>said</b> more at large, and is all that can be necessary.|$|E
25|$|The process only breaks long {{molecular}} chains into shorter ones, {{so small}} molecules such as carbon dioxide or methane cannot {{be converted to}} oil through this process. However, the methane in the feedstock is recovered and burned to heat the water that {{is an essential part}} of the process. In addition, the gas can be burned in a combined heat and power plant, consisting of a gas turbine which drives a generator to create electricity, and a heat exchanger to heat the process input water from the exhaust gas. The electricity can be sold to the power grid, for example under a feed-in tariff scheme. This also increases the overall efficiency of the process (<b>already</b> <b>said</b> to be over 85% of feedstock energy content).|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of Pearl has been positive. In {{a review of}} the first official trailer for The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water, Victoria McNally of The Mary Sue said that Pearl was her favorite character, and she was disappointed not to see her in the movie's preview. She writes, [...] "if they can manage to work Pearl into the plot somewhere, I'll take back everything I've <b>already</b> <b>said</b> about this film. Maybe she could get beached on the shore, I don't know. Pearl's the best." [...] Joseph Foy, author of the novel SpongeBob SquarePants and Philosophy, felt that it was difficult not to sympathize with Pearl's situation since she believes she is [...] "more important to her father than money," [...] but [...] "we, the viewing audience, know differently". DVD Talks Paul Mavis wrote in his review of Legends of Bikini Bottom that he found Pearl [...] "annoyingly funny". In 2013, [...] of El Mundo said that he felt Pearl brings an easily recognizable youthful tone to the show.|$|E

500|$|René Pérez Joglar, who {{performs}} {{as the lead}} singer of Puerto Rican alternative hip hop band {{under the name of}} Residente, appears as a featured artist on the track [...] "Gordita". He explained the conception of the song, in which he raps about the fact that [...] "he liked Shakira better when — early in her career: she was chubbier, had dark hair and was a rock chick", by saying that [...] "I told her (Shakira) {{it was a good idea}} to make fun of yourself. That way the haters can't say anything, because you <b>already</b> <b>said</b> it". British rapper Dizzee Rascal appears as a featured artist on the English version of [...] "Loca". He said that he felt [...] "honoured" [...] that Shakira chose him for the song, by saying that [...] "She's a bit of a trendsetter -- she does loads of different things on a major scale. You'd expect her to use an American rapper (for the song), but she chose me. It meant a lot".|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{found the}} song {{intriguing}} {{and came up}} with interpretations of it as well. Andrew McGregor of the BBC questioned if [...] "Confessions Part II", as well as [...] "Truth Hurts", are only [...] "mere theatre" [...] or telling the truth. Laura Sinagra of Rolling Stone focuses on how Usher admits in the song about impregnating a mistress. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented that Usher was at an age when [...] "getting his 'chick on the side'" [...] seemed appropriate. Outside of rumors, Jem Aswad of Entertainment Weekly said that the best songs from the album were [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] and [...] "Burn", which he described as having smooth melodies. Matt Cibula of Popmatters said of the flow of the concept does not work. He pointed out that in the second part, Usher claims he [...] "barely knows the other lady", while in the first part, he <b>already</b> <b>said</b> that she was his ex-girlfriend. He furthered called it the [...] "wimpiest" [...] song on the theme of the album. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times called it a [...] "tricky infidelity narrative".|$|E
500|$|Kumaritashvili's death raised {{concerns}} about athlete safety at the Winter Olympics. As of 21 February 2010, there were 30 crashes in bobsleigh and luge at the Sliding Centre. Debate was raised on tightening qualification standards in weeding out unqualified athletes, in requiring {{a large number of}} training runs, in slowing down the sliding tracks, or in combining the three. The Russian National Sliding Centre planned for the bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton events at the 2014 Winter Olympics has not been built though organizers <b>already</b> <b>said</b> that it is designed to be [...] slower than The Whistler Sliding Centre. Sochi's Sliding Centre will be monitored via 3-D computer graphics and simulation. The IOC has improved safety standards over the years such as lowering obstacles for the equestrian three-day event, requiring protective head gear for boxing and ice hockey, and tightening qualification standards to preclude athletes not qualified for the event. FIBT President Storey wanted to wait to review safety of bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton until after the 2010 Games, stating that track designers needed to find a balance between challenges and dangers on the track. Track designer Gurgel told Sport Bild that perhaps track walls should be raised [...] on future courses though a risk-proof course may not be possible. According to VANOC, over 30,000 runs were made prior to the games with neither the FIBT nor the FIL issuing public danger warnings about the track. IOC President Jacques Rogge stated that he [...] "will do everything in my power that this should not happen again in the future".|$|E

2500|$|Hagia Theodosia {{became one}} {{among the most}} venerated saints in Constantinople, being invoked {{particularly}} by the infirm.

[...] "The cease-fire, as both the PLO and the Americans saw it, did not include terror attacks stemming from Lebanon and carried out against Jews in Europe and other locales. In a meeting my father had with Alexander Haig and Philip Habib on May 25, 1982, Habib repeated what he had <b>already</b> <b>said</b> many times before: “Terrorist attacks against Israelis and Jews in Europe {{are not included in}} the cease-fire agreement.”" ...|$|E
