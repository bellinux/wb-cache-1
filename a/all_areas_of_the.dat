Although concerned with <b>all</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environment, it focuses on global warming, preserving Earth's biodiversity and supporting renewable energy. It has worked on projects in over 40 countries and has produced two short web documentaries, Water Planet and Global Warning. The foundation has also funded debt-for-nature swaps.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton aided in <b>all</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army's development, {{and after}} Washington's death {{he was by}} default the Senior Officer of the United States Army from December 14, 1799, to June 15, 1800. The army was to guard against {{invasion}} from France. Adams, however, derailed all plans for war by opening negotiations with France. Adams had held it proper to retain the members of Washington's cabinet, except for cause; he found, in 1800 (after Washington's death), that they were obeying Hamilton rather than himself, and fired several of them.|$|E

5|$|Nils Melzer {{presents}} an historical, legal and moral examination of targeted killing. The author observes that after September 11, the Western world grew {{more supportive of}} targeted killing than ever before. The book recounts in depth how state-sanctioned targeted killing is perceived in other countries. He defines targeted killing as the premeditated selection of an individual person not yet in custody for elimination by force. Melzer analyzes <b>all</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> topic.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of the work's {{provenance}} before the 1840s. Given the panels' diminutive size—which is typical of early diptychs—it seems probable that the work was commissioned for private rather than public devotion. The notion of a well-educated patron, with knowledge of and appreciation for the art of earlier centuries, is reinforced by both the classical language inscriptions and the abundant detail found across <b>all</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> panels.|$|E

5|$|The Special Engineer Detachment (SED) was {{activated}} in October 1943 {{as part of}} the 9812th Technical Service Unit. It {{was made}} up of men with technical skills or advanced education, and was mostly drawn from the defunct Army Specialized Training Program. War Department policy forbade giving deferments from the draft to men under 22, so they were assigned to the SED. It reached a peak strength of 1,823 men in August 1945. SED personnel worked in <b>all</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Los Alamos Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist's attacking batting {{has been}} {{a key part of}} Australia's one-day success, as he usually opened the batting. He {{was a part of the}} {{successful}} 1999, 2003 and 2007 Cricket World Cup campaigns. Gilchrist's Test batting average in the upper 40s is unusually high for a wicket-keeper. He is currently 45th on the all–time list of highest batting averages. He maintains a Test strike-rate of 82 runs per hundred balls, the highest since balls were recorded in full. His combination of attack and consistency create one of the most dynamic world cricketers ever, playing shots to <b>all</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field with uncommon timing. He is second on the all-time list of most sixes in Tests at 100 with only Brendon McCullum ahead of him with 107. Gilchrist's skills as a wicket-keeper are sometimes questioned; some people claim that he is the best keeper in Australia whilst others claim that Victorian wicket-keeper Darren Berry is the best Australian wicket-keeper of the 1990s and early 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Plymouth {{is home to}} the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom (MBA) which conducts {{research}} in <b>all</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marine sciences. The Plymouth Marine Laboratory is an offshoot of the MBA. Together with the National Marine Aquarium, the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Sciences, Plymouth University's Marine Institute and the Diving Diseases Research Centre, these marine-related organisations form the Plymouth Marine Sciences Partnership. The Plymouth Marine Laboratory, which focuses on global issues of climate change and sustainability. It monitors the effects of ocean acidity on corals and shellfish and reports the results to the UK government. It also cultivates algae {{that could be used to}} make biofuels or in the treatment of waste water by using technology such as photo-bioreactors. It works alongside the Boots Group to investigate the use of algae in skin care protects, taking advantage of the chemicals they contain that adapt to protect themselves from the sun.|$|E

5|$|The film's animators {{had little}} {{experience}} with computer-animation and feature-length films, {{and had to}} be trained by the producers {{over the course of the}} film's production. Since none of the animators were specialists, they were not divided into specific teams, but instead each worked on <b>all</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animating process. The filmmakers found this to be a poor method though, because it kept the individual skills of the animators from being optimized. Due to their independent backgrounds, the animators were accustomed to working at fast paces, and despite their small numbers, each phase of production was able to be completed within a short period of time. Still, schedule and budget restraints led the filmmakers to enlist Prana Studios in Mumbai, India to perform lighting and compositing.|$|E
5|$|The northeastern Pacific {{hurricane}} basins {{are divided}} into two parts– eastern and central. The eastern Pacific basin extends from <b>all</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pacific north of the equator east of 140°W, while the central Pacific basin includes areas north of the equator between 140°W and 180°W. Both basins extend to the Arctic Circle at 66°N. When tropical cyclones cross from the Atlantic into the Pacific, {{the name of the}} previous storm is retained if the system continues to exhibit tropical characteristics; however, when hurricanes degenerate into a remnant low-pressure area, the system is designated with the next name on the rotating eastern Pacific hurricane naming list.|$|E
5|$|The three Eubalaena species inhabit three {{distinct}} {{areas of the}} globe: the North Atlantic in the western Atlantic Ocean, the North Pacific in a band from Japan to Alaska and <b>all</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Southern Ocean. The whales can only cope with the moderate temperatures found between 20 and 60 degrees in latitude. The warm equatorial waters form a barrier that prevents mixing between {{the northern and southern}} groups with minor exclusions. Although the southern species in particular must travel across open ocean to reach its feeding grounds, the species is not considered to be pelagic. In general, they prefer to stay close to peninsulas and bays and on continental shelves, as these areas offer greater shelter and an abundance of their preferred foods.|$|E

5|$|Treloar {{returned}} to the AWM on 2September 1946 and was formally discharged from the Army in 1947. At the time he believed {{he was suffering from}} bad health, but wanted to resume his work at the Memorial rather than enter hospital. While Clarissa Treloar remained in Melbourne, their daughter Dawn moved to Canberra and took up a position in the Memorial's library. Treloar continued to work long hours in the years after the war. He lived in a cubby hole next to his office and signed the attendance book while walking from bed to his desk. Bean later claimed that Treloar had personally managed <b>all</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Memorial other than its library. While Dawn provided him with company, family members and AWM staff believed that Treloar was lonely and did not have a social life. His letters to the official artists engaged by the AWM were frequently relaxed, however, and he became friends with Leslie Bowles and William Dargie. While Treloar was a teetotaler and non-smoker, he occasionally shared wine and cigarettes with Dargie.|$|E
