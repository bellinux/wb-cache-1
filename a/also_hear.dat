After {{the opening of the}} Royal Courts of Justice in 1882 the Court of Appeal transferred there, where it remains.

500|$|Twenty-first century {{critical}} {{opinion of}} the film is widely positive. Eraserhead holds an average rating of 91% on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, representing the distillation of 55 reviews, with the critical consensus [...] "David Lynch's surreal Eraserhead uses detailed visuals and a creepy score to create a bizarre and disturbing look into a man's fear of parenthood." [...] Writing for Empire magazine, Steve Beard rated the film five stars out of five. He felt that it was [...] "a lot more radical and enjoyable than [...] later Hollywood efforts" [...] and highlighted its mix of surrealist body horror and black comedy. The BBC's Almar Haflidason awarded Eraserhead three stars out of five, describing it as [...] "an unremarkable feat by [...] later standards". Haflidason felt that the film was a gathering of loosely related ideas, adding that it is [...] "so consumed with surreal imagery that there are almost limitless possibilities to read personal theories into it"; the reviewer's own take on these themes were that they represented a fear of personal commitment and featured [...] "a strong sexual undercurrent". A reviewer writing for Film4 rated Eraserhead five stars out of five, describing it as [...] "by turns beautiful, annoying, funny, exasperating and repellent, but always bristling with a nervous energy". The Film4 reviewer felt that Eraserhead was unlike most films released to that point, save for the collaborations between Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí; however, Lynch denies having seen any of these before Eraserhead. Writing for The Village Voice, Nathan Lee praised the film's use of sound, writing [...] "to see the film means nothing—one must <b>also</b> <b>hear</b> it". He described the film's sound design as [...] "an intergalactic seashell cocked to the ears of an acid-tripping gargantua".|$|E
