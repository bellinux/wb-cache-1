500|$|The Flames {{struggled}} to score {{for much of}} the 2009–10 NHL season, and Bouwmeester was no exception. [...] He finished the year with just three goals and rarely served as an offensive catalyst for Calgary. He did not miss a game for the Flames, and while his consecutive games played streak sat at 424 following the season, Bouwmeester also held the <b>active</b> <b>record</b> for most games played without reaching the Stanley Cup Playoffs at 553. Bouwmeester continued to score at a rate below his time in Florida, recording 24 points in 2010–11 and 29 in 2011–12. He led the team in ice time both years, averaging nearly 26 minutes per game. Bouwmeester broke the NHL record for consecutive games played by a defenceman on March 15, 2011 when he appeared in his 486th consecutive game, surpassing Kārlis Skrastiņš.|$|E
2500|$|Ruby on Rails, or [...] Rails, is a {{server-side}} {{web application}} framework written in Ruby under the MIT License. Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages. It encourages and facilitates {{the use of}} web standards such as JSON or XML for data transfer, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for display and user interfacing. In addition to MVC, Rails emphasizes the use of other well-known software engineering patterns and paradigms, including convention over configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself (DRY), and the <b>active</b> <b>record</b> pattern.|$|E

2500|$|Bill Danoff and Taffy Nivert, {{credited}} as co-writers of Denver's song [...] "Take Me Home, Country Roads", {{were close}} friends of Denver and his family, appearing as singers and songwriters {{on many of}} Denver's albums until they formed the Starland Vocal Band in 1976. The band's albums were released on Denver's Windsong Records (later known as Windstar Records) label. Denver's solo recording contract resulted {{in part from the}} recording by Peter, Paul, and Mary of his song [...] "Leaving on a Jet Plane", which became the sole number-1 hit single for the group. Denver recorded songs by Tom Paxton, Eric Andersen, John Prine, David Mallett, and many others in the folk scene. His record company, Windstar, is still an <b>active</b> <b>record</b> label today. Country singer John Berry considers Denver the greatest influence on his own music and has recorded Denver's hit [...] "Annie's Song" [...] with the original arrangement.|$|E
2500|$|Entering the 2006–07 season, the Warriors {{held the}} <b>active</b> <b>record</b> (12) {{for the most}} {{consecutive}} seasons without a playoff appearance (see Active NBA non-playoff appearance streaks). During the 2006 off-season, Golden State announced that it had bought out the remaining two years of coach Montgomery's contract and hired previous Golden State and former Dallas Mavericks coach Don Nelson to take over for him. During training camp, small forward Matt Barnes established himself in the rotation. On January 17, 2007, the Warriors traded the disappointing Murphy and Dunleavy with promising young power forward Ike Diogu and Keith McLeod to the Indiana Pacers for forward Al Harrington, forward/guard Stephen Jackson, guard Šarūnas Jasikevičius and forward Josh Powell. This trade allowed the Warriors to [...] "run and gun" [...] {{their way to the}} playoffs with a more athletic and talented team. On March 4, 2007, the Warriors suffered a 106–107 loss in Washington, the Wizards handing them their 6th straight loss when former Warrior Arenas hit a technical free throw with less than one second remaining after Nelson had protested a controversial call with the Warriors ahead by a slim margin. The loss dropped them to 26–35.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{coupling}} of database interaction and application logic {{when using the}} <b>active</b> <b>record</b> pattern, unit testing an <b>active</b> <b>record</b> object without a database becomes difficult. The negative effects on testability in the <b>active</b> <b>record</b> pattern can be minimized by using mocking or dependency injection frameworks to substitute the real data tier with a simulated one [...]|$|E

50|$|Another {{critique}} of the <b>active</b> <b>record</b> pattern is that, also due to the strong coupling of database interaction and application logic, an <b>active</b> <b>record</b> object does not follow the single responsibility principle and separation of concerns as opposed to multitier architecture which properly addresses these practices. Because of this, the <b>active</b> <b>record</b> pattern is best and most often employed in simple applications that are all forms-over-data with CRUD functionality, or only as one part of an architecture. Typically that part is data access and why several ORMs implement the <b>active</b> <b>record</b> pattern.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} open source {{implementations}} of the <b>Active</b> <b>Record</b> pattern in other languages, including JavaScript (e.g., ActiveJS's <b>Active</b> <b>Record),</b> Perl (DBIx::Class), ActionScript, Haxe (SPOD), C#, Objective-C and Scala.|$|E
