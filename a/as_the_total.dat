5|$|The {{number of}} troops which Xerxes mustered for the second {{invasion}} of Greece {{has been the subject}} of endless dispute, most notably between ancient sources, which report very large numbers, and modern scholars, who surmise much smaller figures.

5|$|The {{total amount}} of energy that a star can {{generate}} through nuclear fusion of hydrogen {{is limited by the}} amount of hydrogen fuel that can be consumed at the core.

5|$|Despite {{an injury}} to pace {{spearhead}} Ray Lindwall, Bradman's fast bowlers reduced England in their first innings to 8/74 before finishing them off for 165. Bradman dropped two catches in this innings. English gloveman Godfrey Evans came to the crease with the score at 6/60, and hit Johnston hard to cover, where the ball went through Bradman for a boundary. The second chance went through Bradman's hand and struck him in the abdomen. However, these missed catches did not cost Australia much, as Evans was soon caught at short leg by Morris close in, leaving England at 7/74. England managed to recover somewhat after Laker and Bedser added 89 runs in only 73 minutes for the ninth wicket. At first, Bradman did not appear concerned by the partnership, and it was surmised {{that he may have}} been happy for England to continue batting so that his top order would not have to bat in fading light {{towards the end of the}} afternoon, but he became anxious <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> continued to mount and both Bedser and Laker appeared comfortable.|$|E

5|$|Enzyme rates {{depend on}} {{solution}} conditions and substrate concentration. To find {{the maximum speed}} of an enzymatic reaction, the substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product formation is seen. This {{is shown in the}} saturation curve on the right. Saturation happens because, as substrate concentration increases, {{more and more of the}} free enzyme is converted into the substrate-bound ES complex. At the maximum reaction rate (Vmax) of the enzyme, all the enzyme active sites are bound to substrate, and the amount of ES complex is the same <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> amount of enzyme.|$|E
5|$|If a {{defendant}} is convicted, the usual remedy for {{a violation of}} one of these provisions is reversal of the conviction or modification of the defendant's sentence.

With the exception of a Double Jeopardy or Speedy Trial violation, the government will usually be permitted to retry the defendant. Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), these provisions are the source of nearly all reviewable errors in federal habeas review of state convictions.|$|E

5|$|The DDL {{project was}} {{reviewed}} {{again when the}} Liberal Fraser Government came into office in late 1975. The review panel unanimously advised the new Minister for Defence James Killen that the DDL project was no longer viable <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> cost of the ships would be about $130 million higher than the Oliver Hazard Perry project, {{and it would take}} three years longer for the DDLs to be completed. Killen accepted this advice, and a firm order for two Oliver Hazard Perry frigates was placed in February 1976. A third ship was ordered in late 1977. Six of these frigates, which were designated the , were eventually ordered, and the final two were built in Australia at Williamstown. The expertise of the DDL project office and the preparations which had been undertaken to manage the process of ordering and building the ships contributed to the Navy's ability to rapidly evaluate alternative designs and oversee their entry into service once an order was placed.|$|E
5|$|The central {{concept of}} natural {{selection}} is the evolutionary fitness of an organism. Fitness is measured by an organism's ability to survive and reproduce, which determines {{the size of its}} genetic contribution to the next generation. However, fitness is not the same <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> number of offspring: instead fitness is indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism's genes. For example, if an organism could survive well and reproduce rapidly, but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive, this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness.|$|E

5|$|The {{numbers of}} troops that Xerxes mustered {{for the second}} {{invasion}} of Greece {{have been the subject}} of endless dispute, because the numbers given in ancient sources are very large indeed. Herodotus claimed that there were, in total, 2.5 million military personnel, accompanied by an equivalent number of support personnel. The poet Simonides, who was a contemporary, talks of four million; Ctesias, based on Persian records, gave 800,000 <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> number of the army (without the support personnel) that was assembled by Xerxes. While it has been suggested that Herodotus or his sources had access to official Persian Empire records of the forces involved in the expedition, modern scholars tend to reject these figures based on knowledge of the Persian military systems, their logistical capabilities, the Greek countryside, and supplies available along the army's route.|$|E
5|$|Takanohana's {{total of}} seven tournament championships by {{the start of}} 1995 was the same <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> won by Akebono, who had reached the yokozuna rank two years before him. However, Takanohana now pulled ahead of his rival. He was at his peak as a yokozuna between 1995 and 1997, during which time he won 11 of the 17 tournaments he entered, {{finishing}} runner-up in the other six. He produced two more perfect scores of 15–0, in September 1995 and September 1996. Overall he won 80 out of 90 bouts he fought in 1995, 70 out of 75 in 1996, and 78 out 90 in 1997, far ahead of any other wrestler. In three of the tournaments Takanohana did not win during this period, he was defeated by stablemates in playoffs: once to Wakanohana and twice to ōzeki Takanonami. Sumo rules prevent wrestlers from the same heya meeting in regular tournament bouts (playoffs excepted) which meant Takanohana avoided not only his brother and Takanonami but also sekiwake Akinoshima and Takatōriki. The merger of his father's Fujishima stable with his uncle's Futagoyama stable in 1993 had added even more top division wrestlers to this list, giving him an advantage over Akebono, who had to face them all. By September 1996 Takanohana had won 15 tournament championships, and was still only 24 years old. However, after sitting out the first tournament of his career in November 1996 due to a back injury suffered on a regional tour, he put on more weight and began to be more susceptible to injury and illness.|$|E
