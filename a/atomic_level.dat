5|$|The {{discovery}} that enzymes could be crystallized eventually allowed their structures {{to be solved}} by x-ray crystallography. This was first done for lysozyme, an enzyme found in tears, saliva and egg whites that digests the coating of some bacteria; the structure was solved by a group led by David Chilton Phillips and published in 1965. This high-resolution structure of lysozyme {{marked the beginning of}} the field of structural biology and the effort to understand how enzymes work at an <b>atomic</b> <b>level</b> of detail.|$|E
5|$|The weak {{interaction}} affects all the fermions of the Standard Model, {{as well as}} the Higgs boson; neutrinos interact through gravity and the {{weak interaction}} only, and neutrinos were the original reason for the name weak force. The weak interaction does not produce bound states (nor does it involve binding energy) – something that gravity does on an astronomical scale, that the electromagnetic force does at the <b>atomic</b> <b>level,</b> and that the strong nuclear force does inside nuclei.|$|E
5|$|The {{scanning}} tunneling microscope is {{a device}} for viewing surfaces at the <b>atomic</b> <b>level.</b> It uses the quantum tunneling phenomenon, which allows particles to pass through a barrier that would normally be insurmountable. Electrons tunnel through the vacuum between two planar metal electrodes, on {{each of which is}} an adsorbed atom, providing a tunneling-current density that can be measured. Scanning one atom (taken as the tip) as it moves past the other (the sample) permits plotting of tip displacement versus lateral separation for a constant current. The calculation shows the extent to which scanning-tunneling-microscope images of an individual atom are visible. It confirms that for low bias, the microscope images the space-averaged dimensions of the electron orbitals across closely packed energy levels—the Fermi level local density of states.|$|E

5|$|The {{hexagonal}} structure {{has a point}} group 6mm (Hermann-Mauguin notation) or C6v (Schoenflies notation), and the space group is P63mc or C6v4. The lattice constants are a = 3.25 Å and c = 5.2 Å; their ratio c/a ~ 1.60 {{is close to the}} ideal value for hexagonal cell c/a = 1.633. As in most group II-VI materials, the bonding in ZnO is largely ionic (Zn2+–O2−) with the corresponding radii of 0.074nm for Zn2+ and 0.140nm for O2−. This property accounts for the preferential formation of wurtzite rather than zinc blende structure, as well as the strong piezoelectricity of ZnO. Because of the polar Zn-O bonds, zinc and oxygen planes are electrically charged. To maintain electrical neutrality, those planes reconstruct at <b>atomic</b> <b>level</b> in most relative materials, but not in ZnO – its surfaces are atomically flat, stable and exhibit no reconstruction. This anomaly of ZnO is not fully explained. However, studies using wurtzoid structures explained the origin of surface flatness and the absence of reconstruction at ZnO wurtzite surfaces in addition to the origin of charges on ZnO planes.|$|E

The method is developed in order to calculate <b>atomic</b> <b>levels</b> and associated linewidths. Unlike previous theories, the present method is able to study the effect of the corrugation of the surface, together with the self-consistent potentials involved. This leads to a shift of <b>atomic</b> <b>levels</b> nonlinear on the external charge, contrary to the traditionally assumed image shift. The method works best at very short distances, where the strong coupling between atom and surface promotes molecular orbitals.

40|$|Today, {{relativistic}} calculations {{are known}} to provide a very successful means {{in the study of}} open-shell atoms and ions. But although accurate atomic data are obtained from these computations, they are traditionally carried out in jj-coupling and, hence, do often not allow for a simple LSJ classification of the <b>atomic</b> <b>levels</b> as needed by experiment. In fact, this lack of providing a proper spectroscopic notation from relativistic structure calculations has recently hampered not only the spectroscopy of medium and heavy elements, but also the interpretation and analysis of inner-shell processes, for which the occurrence of additional vacancies usually leads to a very detailed fine structure. Therefore, in order to facilitate the classification of <b>atomic</b> <b>levels</b> from such computations, here we present a program (within the Ratip environment) which help transform the atomic wave functions from jj-coupled multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock computations into a LS-coupled representation. Beside of a proper LSJ assignment to the <b>atomic</b> <b>levels,</b> the program also supports the full transformation of the wave functions if required for (nonrelativistic) computations...|$|R

When the SQD is {{close enough to the}} MNP, the otherwise equally populated <b>atomic</b> <b>levels</b> can be selectively excited.

Only the radiative exchanges occurring between the <b>atomic</b> <b>levels</b> are considered, and the statistical-equilibrium equations are solved rigorously in the cases of a transparent medium at rest, an outward-accelerating envelope, and an outward-decelerating envelope. The population of the <b>atomic</b> <b>levels</b> are compared for different physical conditions in each case.

25|$|A {{second set}} of {{difficulties}} were related to thermodynamics.

Black-body radiation was not explained without the introduction of quanta.

25|$|A {{variety of}} {{physical}} circumstances {{do not allow}} molecules to be studied in solution, {{and at the same}} time not by other spectroscopic techniques to an <b>atomic</b> <b>level,</b> either. In solid-phase media, such as crystals, microcrystalline powders, gels, anisotropic solutions, etc., it is in particular the dipolar coupling and chemical shift anisotropy that become dominant to the behaviour of the nuclear spin systems. In conventional solution-state NMR spectroscopy, these additional interactions would lead to a significant broadening of spectral lines. A variety of techniques allows establishing high-resolution conditions, that can, at least for 13C spectra, be comparable to solution-state NMR spectra.|$|E
40|$|The {{intuitive}} {{description of}} <b>atomic</b> <b>levels</b> requires {{the use of}} renormalized objects, with lifetime and dressed <b>atomic</b> <b>levels.</b> The reformulation of field theory for avoiding self-energy parts in the dynamical evolution enables us to provide such a description outside the scope of the usual quantum mechanics. That approach is illustrated here on a two-level system, interacting with a field, inside and outside the rotating wave approximation (RWA). A kinetic extension of the description is reached, enabling a statistical mixture to change its composition with time. The original reversible description is embedded in the new one and is recovered now from a restricted class of initial conditions. After dressing, the structure of the kinetic operators inside and outside the RWA is now common. SCOPUS: cp. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic fields play a {{key role}} in most astrophysical systems, from the Sun to active galactic nuclei.

Here we report peculiarly polarized light in the He I 10830 -Å multiplet observed in a coronal filament located at the centre of the solar disk. We show that the polarized light arises from selective absorption from the ground level of the triplet system of helium, and that it implies the presence of magnetic fields of the order of a few gauss that are highly inclined with respect to the solar radius vector. This disproves the common belief that population imbalances in long-lived <b>atomic</b> <b>levels</b> are insignificant in the presence of inclined fields with strengths in the gauss range, and demonstrates the operation of the ground-level Hanle effect in an astrophysical plasma.
