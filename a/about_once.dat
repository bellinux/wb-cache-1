5|$|The sultanate of Oman, {{located on}} the southeastern corner of the Arabian Peninsula, {{regularly}} receives the impacts of tropical cyclones due to its long coastline along the Arabian Sea. On average, storms strike Oman once every three years, mostly between Masirah Island and Salalah, and usually before June or after October. From 1943 to 1967, tropical cyclones accounted for about 25% of Salalah's overall rainfall. <b>About</b> <b>once</b> every five years, a storm affects the Dhofar region of southern Oman, and Oman's capital of Muscat <b>about</b> <b>once</b> every ten years in. Between 1890 and 1996, 36storms struck Oman, although some landfalling storms might be excluded from the historical record {{due to the lack}} of population centers. In addition, storm intensities at landfall have only been accurately known since around 1979, and reliable record keeping began around 1970. In 2014, an archaeology team discovered evidence that a major flood affected Ras Al Hadd in eastern Oman, possibly the result of a tsunami or a severe storm.|$|E
5|$|Tolerance to {{psilocybin}} builds and dissipates quickly; ingesting psilocybin {{more than}} <b>about</b> <b>once</b> a week {{can lead to}} diminished effects. Tolerance dissipates after a few days, so doses can be spaced several days apart to avoid the effect. A cross-tolerance can develop between psilocybin and the pharmacologically similar LSD, and between psilocybin and phenethylamines such as mescaline and DOM.|$|E
5|$|Although supernovae are {{relatively}} rare events, occurring on average <b>about</b> <b>once</b> every 50 {{years in the}} Milky Way, observations of distant galaxies allowed supernovae to be discovered and examined more frequently. The first supernova detection patrol was begun by Zwicky in 1933. He was joined by Josef J. Johnson from Caltech in 1936. Using a 45-cm Schmidt telescope at Palomar observatory, they discovered twelve new supernovae within three years by comparing new photographic plates to reference images of extragalactic regions.|$|E

5|$|North Carolina is a U.S. state {{located on}} the Atlantic Seaboard in the southeastern United States. Tropical cyclones—storms {{characterized}} by a large low-pressure center and numerous thunderstorms that produce strong winds and heavy rain—regularly affect the state.

5|$|The high {{population}} of the asteroid belt makes for a very active environment, where collisions between asteroids occur frequently (on astronomical time scales). Collisions between main-belt bodies with a mean radius of 10km are expected to occur <b>about</b> <b>once</b> every 10 million years. A collision may fragment an asteroid into numerous smaller pieces (leading {{to the formation of}} a new asteroid family). Conversely, collisions that occur at low relative speeds may also join two asteroids. After more than 4 billion years of such processes, the members of the asteroid belt now bear little resemblance to the original population.|$|E
5|$|About 1 in 1000 adults {{per year}} has DVT, {{but as of}} 2011, {{available}} data are dominated by North American and European populations. VTE is rare in children, with an incidence of about 1 in 100,000 a year. From childhood to old age, incidence increases {{by a factor of}} about 1000, with almost 1% of the elderly experiencing VTE yearly. During pregnancy and after childbirth, acute VTE occurs <b>about</b> <b>once</b> per 1000 deliveries. After surgery with preventative treatment, VTE develops in about 10 of 1000 people after total or partial knee replacement, and in about 5 of 1000 after total or partial hip replacement. About 300,000–600,000 Americans develop VTE each year, with about 60,000–100,000 deaths attributable to PE. In England, an estimated 25,000 a year die from hospital-related VTE. For unclear reasons, people of Asian descent have a lower VTE risk than whites.|$|E
5|$|Monitor, to the {{surprise}} of Virginias crew, had emerged from behind Minnesota and went straight for the approaching Virginia and positioned herself between her and the grounded Minnesota, preventing the Confederate ironclad from further engaging the vulnerable wooden ship at close range. At 8:45am Worden gave the order to fire where Greene fired the first shots of the battle between the two ironclads which harmlessly deflected off the Confederate ironclad. During the battle Monitor fired solid shot, <b>about</b> <b>once</b> every eight minutes, while Virginia fired shell exclusively. The ironclads generally fought at close range for about four hours, ending at 12:15pm, ranging from a few yards to more than a hundred. Both ships were constantly in motion, maintaining a circular pattern. Because of Virginias weak engines, massive size and weight and with a draft of , she was slow and difficult to maneuver, taking her half an hour to complete a 180-degree turn.|$|E

5|$|Safeties are {{the least}} common method of scoring in American {{football}} but are not rare occurrences– since 1932, a safety has occurred once every 14.31 games in the National Football League (NFL), or <b>about</b> <b>once</b> a week under current scheduling rules. On October 21, 1973, Fred Dryer, playing for the Los Angeles Rams against the Green Bay Packers, became the only player in NFL History to score two safeties in a single game. A much rarer occurrence is the one-point safety, which can be scored by the offense on an extra point or two-point conversion attempt; those have occurred at least twice in NCAA Division I football since 1996, most recently at the 2013 Fiesta Bowl. No conversion safeties have occurred since at least 1940 in the NFL. A conversion safety by the defense is also possible, though highly unlikely; although this has never occurred, {{it is the only}} possible way a team could finish with a single point in an American football game.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 Super Outbreak was the largest, costliest, {{and one of}} {{the deadliest}} tornado {{outbreaks}} ever recorded, affecting the Southern, Midwestern, and Northeastern United States and leaving catastrophic destruction in its wake. The event affected Alabama and Mississippi the most severely, but it also produced destructive tornadoes in Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia, and affected many other areas throughout the Southern and Eastern United States. In total, 362 tornadoes were confirmed by NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS) and Government of Canada's Environment Canada in 21 states from Texas to New York to southern Canada. Widespread and destructive tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, with April 27 being the most active day with a record of 218 tornadoes touching down that day from midnight to midnight CDT (0500 – 0500 UTC). Four of the tornadoes were destructive enough to be rated EF5, which is the highest ranking possible on the Enhanced Fujita scale; typically these tornadoes are only recorded <b>about</b> <b>once</b> each year or less.|$|E
5|$|The Moon makes a {{complete}} orbit around Earth {{with respect to}} the fixed stars <b>about</b> <b>once</b> every 27.3days (its sidereal period). However, because Earth is moving in its orbit around the Sun at the same time, it takes slightly longer for the Moon to show the same phase to Earth, which is about 29.5days (its synodic period). Unlike most satellites of other planets, the Moon orbits closer to the ecliptic plane than to the planet's equatorial plane. The Moon's orbit is subtly perturbed by the Sun and Earth in many small, complex and interacting ways. For example, the plane of the Moon's orbit gradually rotates once every 18.61 years, which affects other aspects of lunar motion. These follow-on effects are mathematically described by Cassini's laws.|$|E

5|$|The {{frilled shark}} is aplacental viviparous; the {{developing}} embryos are mainly nourished by yolk, though {{the difference in}} weight between the egg and the newborn indicates that the mother also provides additional nutrition via unknown means. Adult females have two functional ovaries and one functional uterus, on the right. Unsurprisingly, there is no defined breeding season for either sex, as this shark inhabits depths at which {{there is little to}} no seasonal influence. A possible mating aggregation of 15 male and 19 female sharks has been recorded over a seamount on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The litter size ranges from two to fifteen, with an average of six. Females ovulate eggs into the uterus <b>about</b> <b>once</b> every two weeks; vitellogenesis (yolk formation) and the growth of new ovarian eggs halt during pregnancy, apparently due to insufficient space inside the body cavity.|$|E
5|$|The {{isotopes}} of neptunium {{range in}} atomic weight from 225.0339 u (225Np) to 244.068 u (244Np). Most of the isotopes that are {{lighter than the}} most stable one, 237Np, decay primarily by electron capture although a sizable number, most notably 229Np and 230Np, also exhibit various levels of decay via alpha emission to become protactinium. 237Np itself, being the beta-stable isobar of mass number 237, decays almost exclusively by alpha emission into 233Pa, with very rare (occurring only <b>about</b> <b>once</b> in trillions of decays) spontaneous fission and cluster decay (emission of 30Mg to form 207Tl). All of the known isotopes except one that are heavier than this decay exclusively via beta emission. The lone exception, 240mNp, exhibits a rare (>0.12%) decay by isomeric transition {{in addition to the}} beta emission. 237Np eventually decays to form bismuth-209 and thallium-205, unlike most other common heavy nuclei which decay into isotopes of lead. This decay chain is known as the neptunium series. This decay chain had long been extinct on Earth due to the short half-lives of all of its isotopes above bismuth-209, but is now being resurrected thanks to artificial production of neptunium on the tonne scale.|$|E
5|$|The {{rendezvous}} and first-ever docking {{between two}} spacecraft was successfully completed after 6.5 hours in orbit. Contact {{with the crew}} was intermittent {{due to the lack}} of tracking stations covering their entire orbits. Out of contact with the ground, the docked spacecraft began to roll, and Armstrong attempted to correct this with the Orbital Attitude and Maneuvering System (OAMS) of the Gemini spacecraft. Following the earlier advice of Mission Control, they undocked, but found that the roll increased dramatically to the point where they were turning <b>about</b> <b>once</b> per second, which meant the problem was in their Gemini's attitude control. Armstrong decided the only course of action was to engage the Reentry Control System (RCS) and turn off the OAMS. Mission rules dictated that once this system was turned on, the spacecraft would have to reenter at the next possible opportunity. It was later thought that damaged wiring made one of the thrusters become stuck in the on position.|$|E
