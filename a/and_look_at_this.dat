2500|$|In 1886, Circuit-riding Methodist {{minister}} Artemas Lester {{started a}} {{school at the}} small community of McTyeire, Georgia, named after Bishop Holland McTyeire. The goal of the McTyeire Institute was to provide rural Appalachian Mountain children in north Georgia with an opportunity for an education. Lester wrote to Judge Harris, asking for a $100 loan, which was promptly granted. Zell Miller, Young Harris' most famous native, wrote {{a history of the}} school and town. He [...] commented, [...] "Young L. G. Harris was a big Methodist church member, and didn’t have time to come <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> school in the Brasstown valley, so he sent his associate, a Mr. Thomas, who looked it over and liked the idea." [...] After hearing positive things about the school, Harris resolved to increase his support of the institution. Harris funded the construction of the campus for $20,000, ($4.27 million in 2010 dollars) then continued to contribute several thousand dollars each year.|$|E

6000|$|... "All right!" [...] sang out Stillman. [...] "Come, everybody, <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this!</b> It {{was right}} under our noses all the time, and we didn't see it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Choose to stop them, {{to reform}} them--isn't that the choice?" [...] Biddy asked. [...] "That's Nick's," [...] she added, {{blushing}} <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> personage.|$|R
60|$|Olive stood <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> smooth-faced, flat-mouthed spinster. She was pale, she trembled a little, but {{she spoke}} no word; {{she was a}} girl who did not go into particulars, {{especially}} with a person such as this woman standing before her.|$|R
40|$|Dublin?s current boom shares many {{features}} {{with urban}} booms elsewhere. In this short paper, I suggest applying an open city framework to Dublin <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> framework?s implications for two policies {{closely related to}} housing. I conclude with a scheme that should accompany future Dublin development...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] said Alderling, {{in a tone}} of relief. [...] "She's good to beat any fog {{in these}} parts ashore. I wish you would come <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> a minute." ...|$|E
6000|$|One day, {{seeing a}} very good-looking man {{crossing}} the street, the king called {{his daughter and}} said: 'Come quickly, dear Cannetella, <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> man, for I think he might suit you as a husband.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] he remarked, [...] "why, {{when you}} have the whole day in which to come <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> {{magnificent}} view, you should choose to come just at the hour when it has practically been swallowed up." ...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{reflects on}} the fact that the idea of determinism, or fatalism, keeps recurring, in very different contexts, at different times: logical fatalism, theological fatalism, physical determinism, etc. Standing back <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> big picture, it voices the suspicion that all these different determinist theses are manifestations of a single, deeper, conceptual trouble...|$|R
60|$|Ferdinand blushed, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> {{confused}} <b>at</b> <b>this</b> appeal, <b>and</b> muttered some contradictory compliments.|$|R
3000|$|I: If we {{discard the}} context <b>and</b> only <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> number sentence, {{what does it}} mean by 4 [*]×[*] 3 [*]×[*] 2 ? [...]...|$|R
6000|$|Pauline heard now. Manuel {{felt her}} start, saw her flush and pale, then her eye lit, {{and the dark}} {{expression}} he dreaded to see settled on {{her face as she}} whispered, like a satanic echo, [...] "Let us also go <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> unfortunate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} sure you did, {{but it is}} no good our following; the side roads are so cut up by ruts that we should break a spring before we had gone a hundred yards. No, we will stop <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> fellow who is unhorsed, Mark." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The matter!" [...] says she, in her shrill {{voice and}} her half-foreign English. [...] "Use your own eyes, if you please, <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> cheek of mine. What! have you lived so long {{a time with}} your mistress, and don't you know the mark of her hand yet?" ...|$|E
60|$|You {{asked if}} there were men in England when the country was covered with ice <b>and</b> snow. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> judge for yourself.|$|R
60|$|Francis {{turned in}} his place <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> {{steadily}} <b>at</b> <b>this</b> unsought-for companion, learning nothing, however, from the half-mocking smile and imperturbable expression.|$|R
5000|$|As with politics, {{and with}} a family point of view, I always <b>looked</b> up <b>and</b> now <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> {{alliance}} as the most desirable in all respects.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Adam," [...] {{replied the}} page, [...] "if you must needs know, I {{am about to}} take a walk <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> fair city. One may as well be still mewed up in the old castle of the lake, if one is to sit the live-long night between four walls, and hearken to old ballads." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Man-Pack do {{not love}} jungle-tales, nor do I think, Mysa, that a scratch {{more or less}} on thy hide is any matter for a council. But I will go <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> village. Yes, I will go. Softly now. It is not every night that the Master of the Jungle comes to herd thee." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{sit there}} <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> bread. I {{sit here and}} look at you, and I hold this bread. And you stop still, and I stop still, while I count three. Now then--uno--" [...] the dog couldn't bear these numerals, with their awful slowness. He {{snatched}} desperately. The man yelled and lost the bread, the dog, gulping, turned to creep away.|$|E
60|$|The women stopped <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> round <b>at</b> <b>this.</b> Siegmund {{bent his}} head lower. Vera resumed her talk. It died out, {{and there was}} silence.|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, Barney," [...] cried Martin, who {{had gone}} ahead of his companions, [...] "come here, man, <b>and</b> just <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> pond. It's {{literally}} crammed full of alligators." ...|$|R
40|$|The article {{considers}} how contemporary cultural performances indicial, {{the worldwide}} proliferation of fictional {{theme of the}} zombie apocalypse, through comic books, board games, movies, games, television serials, posters, rallies. Since then, reflects the theme <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> set of products and actions, limited the issue: the current crisis is a crisis of guidance within a world not interpretable, as demonstrates the zombie invasion? To this end, rests on concepts of cultural performances delimiters (GOFFMAN, 2011); social drama (TURNER, 1974); culture (GEERTZ, 1989); and social crisis (JAMESON, 1997; SENNETT, 1998) ...|$|R
6000|$|For instance, {{dinner was}} over, and Henrietta was admiring some choice books of prints, such luxuries as Uncle Geoffrey now afforded himself, and which {{his wife and}} {{daughter}} greatly preferred to the more costly style of living which some people thought befitted them. She called to her brother who was standing by the fire, [...] "Fred, do come <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> beautiful Albert Durer of Sintram." ...|$|E
6000|$|GAYNOR. That's obvious. T.B. is {{extremely}} contagious, {{you must know}} that. Yet I'll bet she's been fondling and kissing those brothers and sisters of hers regardless. (Nicholls fidgets uneasily on his chair.) <b>And</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> house sealed tight against the fresh air! Not a window open an inch! (Fuming.) That's what we're up against in the fight with T.B.--a total ignorance of the commonest methods of prevention---- ...|$|E
6000|$|... --For the {{old woman}} of Prince's street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ. The pledgebound party {{on the floor of}} the house. <b>And</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> blasted rag, says he. Look at this, says he. The Irish Independent, if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman's friend. Listen to the births and deaths in the Irish all for Ireland Independent, and I'll thank you and the marriages.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{very cold}} and a very stiff Smith who awoke on the {{following}} morning, to find himself exactly where he had lain down--namely, on a cement floor beneath the keel of a funeral boat in the central hall of the Cairo Museum. He crept from his shelter shivering, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> hall, to find it quite as empty {{as it had been}} on the previous evening. Not a sign or a token was there of Pharaoh Menes and all those kings and queens of whom he had dreamed so vividly.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's plain, of course," [...] said Kipps, {{standing}} beside his uncle <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> down <b>at</b> <b>this</b> plan, which certainly did {{seem a little}} less magnificent now than it had at the first encounter.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Scoff and chafe, Baird, but <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his work. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> Normandy, {{freed from}} misrule and exaction, in peace <b>and</b> order. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> land. Was ever king so loved? Or how durst he act {{as he did}} this day?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Or a more {{thoroughly}} worked pack," [...] added the captain, in a condoling manner. [...] "Well, {{we are not}} all perfect, and I hope Mrs. Abbott will cheer up <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> matter in a gayer point of view. For myself I hold that a skipping-rope is worse than the Jack of spades, Sundays or week days. Commodore, we shall see no pickerel to-day, unless we tear ourselves from this good company." ...|$|E
6000|$|HORNBLOWER. He's {{a part of}} {{the whole}} dog-in-the-manger system that stands in my way. Ye're a woman, and ye don't {{understand}} these things. Ye wouldn't believe the struggle I've had to make my money and get my position. These county folk talk soft sawder, but to get anything from them's like gettin' butter out of a dog's mouth. If they could drive me out of here by fair means or foul, would they hesitate a moment? Not they! See what they've made me pay; <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> letter. Selfish, mean lot o' hypocrites! ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was a day}} or {{two after}} they {{returned}} that Phyllis was leaning on the window-sill in the drawing-room, watching a passing shower, and admiring the soft bright tints of a rainbow upon the dark gray mass of cloud. 'I do set my bow in the cloud,' repeated she to herself over and over again, until Adeline entering the room, she eagerly exclaimed, 'Oh Ada, come <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> beautiful rainbow, green, and pink, and purple. A double one, with so many stripes, Ada. See, there is a little bit more green.' ...|$|E
5000|$|During the 1992 General Election campaign, Conservative MP Edwina Currie {{poured a}} {{glass of orange juice}} over Snape shortly after an edition of the Midlands-based debate show Central Weekend had {{finished}} airing. Speaking about the incident later, Currie said, [...] "I just <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> my orange juice, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> man from which this stream of abuse was emanating, and thought 'I know how to shut you up.'" [...] A civil court (High Court action) led to compensation of £15,000 from Currie after she [...] "falsely suggested in her memoirs that it happened after Snape had been 'drinking vodka in a club with cronies'." ...|$|R
6000|$|What {{thoughts}} must {{through the}} creature's brain have pass'd! [...] To this place {{from the stone}} upon the steep [...] Are but three bounds, <b>and</b> <b>look,</b> Sir, <b>at</b> <b>this</b> last! [...] O Master! {{it has been a}} cruel leap.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1992 General Election campaign, Conservative MP Edwina Currie {{poured a}} {{glass of orange juice}} over Labour's Peter Snape shortly after an edition of the show had {{finished}} airing. Speaking about the incident later, Currie said [...] "I just <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> my orange juice, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> man from which this stream of abuse was emanating, and thought 'I know how to shut you up.' [...] ". On another occasion, during a debate on women's football in March 1998, an audience member got drunk and ran amok on set, forcing the show to be taken off the air. 44-year-old Robert Davy was later jailed for 12 months over the incident.|$|R
