The {{age at which}} <b>a</b> <b>kitten</b> becomes {{difficult}} to socialize is not agreed upon, but suggestions generally range from seven weeks to four months of age.

25|$|Odie is a yellow, long-eared beagle with a large, slobbering tongue, {{who walks}} {{on all four}} legs, though {{occasionally}} he will walk on two like Garfield. He was originally owned by Jon's friend Lyman, though Jon adopted him after Lyman was written out of the strip. The book Garfield: His 9 Lives (1984) retcons Odie's origin: {{there is no mention}} of Lyman, and Odie was a puppy when he was acquired by Jon as company for Garfield (when Garfield was <b>a</b> <b>kitten).</b> Odie is usually portrayed as naïve, happy, affectionate and blissfully unaware of Garfield's cynical, sadistic nature, despite the physical abuse Garfield exhibits toward him, including regularly kicking him off the kitchen table or tricking him into going over the edge himself. On some occasions, however, he is depicted more intelligently, as one strip, in which he holds a heavy rock to prevent Garfield from doing this, and actually hurts Garfield's foot. In one strip when Garfield and Jon are out of the house, Odie is seen reading War and Peace and watching a television program, An Evening With Mozart. Odie has only talked once. In another strip, published on January 28, 2010, he is seen solving Jon's sudoku puzzle.|$|E

500|$|The Story of Miss Moppet is a {{tale about}} teasing, {{featuring}} <b>a</b> <b>kitten</b> and a mouse, that was {{written and illustrated by}} Beatrix Potter. [...] It was published by Frederick Warne & Co for the 1906 Christmas season. Potter was born in London in 1866, and between 1902 and 1905 published a series of small format children's books with Warne. In 1906, she experimented with an atypical panorama design for Miss Moppet, which booksellers disliked; the story was reprinted in 1916 in small book format.|$|E
500|$|Miss Moppet, the story's eponymous main character, is <b>a</b> <b>kitten</b> teased by a mouse. While {{pursuing}} him she bumps {{her head}} on a cupboard. She then wraps a duster about her head, and sits before the fire [...] "looking very ill". The curious mouse creeps closer, is captured, [...] "and because the Mouse has teased Miss Moppet—Miss Moppet thinks she will tease the Mouse; which {{is not at all}} nice of Miss Moppet". She ties him up in the duster and tosses him about. [...] However, the mouse makes his escape, and once safely out of reach, dances a jig atop the cupboard.|$|E
500|$|Although he was {{the leading}} expert writing in English, Nicolson does not suggest that Wright {{is likely to have}} known of the 17th-century candlelit {{narrative}} religious subjects of Georges de La Tour and Trophime Bigot, which, in their seriousness, are the closest works to Wright that are lit only by candle. The Dutch painters' works and other candlelit scenes by 18th-century English painters such as Henry Morland (father of George) tended instead to exploit the possibilities of semi-darkness for erotic suggestiveness. Some of Wright's own later candlelit scenes were by no means as serious as his first ones, as seen from their titles: Two Boys Fighting Over a Bladder and Two Girls Dressing <b>a</b> <b>Kitten</b> by Candlelight.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] was {{directed}} by Melina Matsoukas and co-directed by Knowles for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, which was released the same month. It was the first video of the eight videos shot in two weeks for the album. The music video for [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] is only one-minute long and it serves as the introduction for the music video of [...] "Green Light". On the other hand, Matsoukas said that the half-day shoot for [...] "Kitty Kat", by comparison, [...] "was a breeze." [...] Elaborating on the conception of the video, Knowles said: [...] "We had the oversized kitty cat , which was so cute! I had to pretend it was there, because I was really {{in front of the}} green screen — I'd be on a big giant wooden cow and they superimposed <b>a</b> <b>kitten.</b> And we used leopard-print makeup and the catsuit and the nails to make me more like a cat. I really am a cat person".|$|E
500|$|Potter was at Hill Top in July 1906 {{during the}} {{development}} of Miss Moppet, and the kitten she borrowed as a model from a mason from Windermere was a difficult subject. [...] "n exasperating model," [...] Potter wrote, [...] "I have borrowed <b>a</b> <b>Kitten</b> and I am rather glad of the opportunity of working at the drawings. It is very young and pretty and a most fearful pickle." [...] Biographer Linda Lear explains that [...] "pickle" [...] was a word Potter used to describe [...] "free-thinking exuberant people, like her cousin Caroline, or mischievous kittens and small children." [...] Potter used the same drawings of the kitten {{as a model for}} her next book, The Tale of Tom Kitten, which she dedicated in 1907 [...] "to all Pickles—especially those that get upon my garden wall". Miss Moppet is one of Tom Kitten's sisters, and appears as a character in both books featuring him: The Tale of Tom Kitten and The Tale of Samuel Whiskers or The Roly-Poly Pudding (1908).|$|E

An episode of MTV Unplugged starring Cyrus premiered through MTV on January 29, 2014; Madonna appeared as a surprise guest that evening to sing an acoustic medley of [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] and her own [...] "Don't Tell Me". Later that year, Cyrus performed [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] during her headlining Bangerz Tour. A critic from the Nashville Scene praised Cyrus' performance, writing, [...] "We Can’t Stop was sung by Miley and hilariously lip-synced by <b>a</b> <b>kitten</b> on screen." [...] Blake Hannon provided a positive review, writing, [...] "The crowd erupted for the opening notes of We Can't Stop." [...] Cyrus returned to perform the song during the musical festival on June 21, 2014, Summertime Ball at Wembley Stadium of London, in front of 80,000 people.|$|E
