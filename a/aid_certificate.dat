5|$|Ambulance Driver – Some {{services}} employ {{staff with}} no medical qualification (or just a first <b>aid</b> <b>certificate)</b> {{whose job is}} to simply drive the patients from place to place. In some emergency ambulance contexts this term is a pejorative toward qualified providers implying that they perform no function but driving, although it may be acceptable for patient transport or community operations. In some areas, these drivers would survey and study the local network of routes for better performance of service, as some road routes may be blocked, and the driver must know another route to the patient or to the hospital. The driver would gather the local weather and traffic status reports before and in-between emergencies. They may also have training in using the radio and knowing where medical supplies are stored in the ambulance.|$|E

40|$|First aid, as a {{profession}} in its own right, {{has a history of}} only 120 years. It evolved from the teachings of the Royal Humane Society and military surgeons, who saw the wisdom of training in splinting and bandaging for battlefield wounds. In 1878 two Aberdeenshire military officers, Surgeon-Major Peter Shepherd of the Royal Herbert Military Hospital, Woolwich, London, and Colonel Francis Duncan established the concept of teaching first aid skills to civilians. This radical new enterprise, conducted {{under the auspices of the}} newly formed St John Ambulance Association, was a natural evolution from the body's philanthropic and ambulance transport work. Shepherd conducted the first class in the hall of the Presbyterian school in Woolwich using a comprehensive first aid curriculum that he had developed. Within months of that first class, local Woolwich civilians used their skills when the pleasure boat Princess Alice sank in the Thames at Woolwich, killing 600 people. Within a decade, the new discipline of first aid spread rapidly throughout the world, and by the end of the 19 th century, hundreds of thousands of St John first <b>aid</b> <b>certificates</b> had been awarded in four continents. Shepherd's pioneering classes changed the world's concept of the need for the provision of skilled prehospital care...|$|R

40|$|A Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is a {{collection}} of wireless mobile nodes that dynamically forms a temporary network without any fixed infrastructure. Each node participates in the ad hoc routing protocol that helps it to discover multi-hop paths through the network to any node. Security challenges have become a primary concern for these networks due to their characteristics such as open medium, dynamic topology, distributed collaboration and other various constraints like battery power and low bandwidth. An Authentication mechanism is certainly needed to prevent the various possible attacks by any malicious node. In this study, we propose an efficient authentication protocol, named CAODV for a MANET with the <b>aid</b> of cryptographic <b>certificates.</b> We implemented this CAODV protocol using the network simulator NS- 2 and the simulation results reveal that this mechanism is highly effective even in the presence of large number of malicious nodes. Despite a considerable increase in the routing overhead, it is minimal and outweighed by the increased security services provided by our proposed CAODV protocol for MANET...|$|R
