Therefore, a relay should be preselected according to the difference value (e.g., ΔTji) between the link throughput from the eNB to the relaying UE (e.g., i) and the link throughput from the eNB to the receiving UE (e.g., j). In this paper, we also adopt such idea (see line 4 and line 15), where Vi (or Vj) is the set of all the UEs within the <b>approximate</b> <b>coverage</b> of UE i (or UE j).

This can frequently occur when objects move around the boundary of coverage of an identification sensor. Moreover, the effect of the smaller <b>approximated</b> <b>coverage</b> than the actual coverage is similar to the effect of the larger <b>approximated</b> <b>coverage</b> than actual coverage. Since the number of registered identifications is different from the number of estimated positions within the <b>approximated</b> <b>coverage,</b> this may increase group or incomplete group associations. However, the estimated positions of objects are eventually identified when single associations are established. While the inaccurate coverage model may delay the establishment of single associations, the number of single associations eventually increases by the object dynamics.|$|R

Then, the actual coverage of an identification sensor can be different from the <b>approximated</b> <b>coverage</b> by a visual sensor and the condition in (3) may not be satisfied—there are more than one unassociated objects' positions but fewer number of unassociated ID's, or vice versa. Even if the coverage of the identification sensor is not time-varying, there can still be the coverage uncertainty problem, when objects are densely populated near the boundary of the coverage. In order to adapt to the time-varying coverage of the identification sensor, the maximum sensing coverage of the identification sensor can be assumed by the visual sensor.|$|R

30|$|The {{basic idea}} of the {{coverage}} adjustment scheme is to compare the number of estimated positions {{with the number of}} registered identifications within the coverage of an identification sensor. If the approximated radius of an identification sensor is accurate enough, the number of the estimated positions is mostly equivalent to the number of the registered identifications. Otherwise, it means that the <b>approximated</b> <b>coverage</b> differs from the actual coverage. The radius of an identification sensor is adjusted by checking the difference between them. In some cases, the system needs to check the farthest or closet estimated position from the center of an identification sensor. For example, when the number of the estimated positions is equivalent to the number of the registered identifications, the coverage of an identification should be adjust to the farthest estimated position. Then, the problem in the coverage adjustment scheme is to determine how degree the radius is adjusted by at each sampling time. Since the coverage of an identification sensor can vary temporally, the large change of the radius may cause a reverse effect and the association performance may degenerate. Thus, we use the average speed of tracked objects measured by the association system as the degree of the radius adjustment to be unsusceptible to the object dynamics.|$|R

Towards this, we consider {{the question of how}} well can one class of submodular functions be approximated by another (simpler) class of submodular functions. Such approximations naturally allow algorithms designed for the simpler class to be applied to the bigger class of functions. We prove both upper and lower bounds on such approximations.

Modeling this network as a uniform binomial point process (BPP), we derive the downlink coverage {{probability of a}} reference receiver located at an arbitrary position on the ground assuming Nakagami-m fading for all wireless links. The reference receiver is assumed to connect to its closest transmitting node as is usually the case in cellular systems. After deriving the distribution of distances from the reference receiver to the serving and interfering nodes, we derive an exact expression for downlink coverage probability {{in terms of the}} derivative of Laplace transform of interference power distribution.

Using asymptotic expansion of incomplete gamma function, we concretely show that this limit reduces to a redundant condition.

30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{approach}} for dynamic object identification in heterogeneous sensor networks where two functionally different sensors are incorporated. Visual sensors associate objects and track them using the geometric relationship of multiple cameras [17, 18]. The visual sensor-based tracking system is assisted by identification sensors {{in identifying the}} estimated positions of objects. The coverage of identification sensors is assumed by its maximum sensing coverage and the association system applies the simple association strategy for the estimated position from the visual sensor and the identification from the identification sensor. The important issue in heterogeneous sensor networks is to provide the association system with a common reference information fusing heterogeneous data. The visual sensors-based tracking system utilizes the known coverage of the identification sensors to associate the heterogeneous data. The locations of identification sensors are known and they are jointly used with the locations of objects to check the object dynamics of entering and leaving the sensor coverage. The sets of estimated positions and identifications are defined for the coverage of each identification sensor. The association of them is established by checking the temporal change of the sets. In order to solve the association problem with the coverage uncertainty issue, a group and incomplete group associations are introduced. The group and incomplete group associations enable the association system to maintain identification candidates for the corresponding estimated positions until a single association is established. Also, a group association can stabilize the association performance against the inconsistent registration of identifications by an identification sensor. Additional association cases are investigated to increase the association performance by checking the object dynamics. We also identify more association problems with {{the discrepancy between the}} actual coverage by the identification sensor and the <b>approximated</b> <b>coverage</b> by the visual sensor and present a coverage adjustment scheme using the object dynamics. Finally, the proposed association method is evaluated with a realistic scenario and is analyzed to show the stability of the proposed method according to degree of the discrepancy between approximated and actual identification sensor coverage, variance of actual identification sensor coverage, and tracking performance.|$|R
