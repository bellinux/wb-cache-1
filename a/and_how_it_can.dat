The Simons Foundation is an organization founded by Jim Simons and his wife Marilyn, and has awarded $130 million for autism research as of 2008. As scientific director, Fischbach collaborates with mathematicians, engineers, chemists, and neuroscientists to try and understand autism more completely. Currently, Fischbach oversees research focusing on the neurobiology of autism <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> relate to finding a possible cure.|$|E

The specific topics that form the main foci of research change over time, driven by an ever-expanding base of knowledge and the availability of increasingly sophisticated technical methods. Over the long term, improvements in technology have been the primary drivers of progress. Developments in electron microscopy, computers, electronics, functional brain imaging, and most recently genetics and genomics, have all been major drivers of progress.|$|E

25|$|As a 13-year-old {{high school}} student, Bowers's {{interests}} included reptiles, scouting, short-wave radio, Strombecker kit models of World War II airplanes, and rocks and minerals. During this time Bowers {{became interested in}} the written word. He received Raymond L. Ditmars' Reptiles of North America from his mother as a Christmas gift in 1952. According to Bowers, Ditmars, who was curator of reptiles at the New York Zoological Garden (Bronx Zoo), had a way of making just about anything sound fascinating. From such experiences, Bowers learned the power of the written word <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> spur one to a great enthusiasm for acquisition.|$|E
25|$|After the 2012 English cricket season had finished, Boyce {{set out to}} {{walk the}} length of Great Britain on a route from John o' Groats to Land's End {{in order to raise}} money and promote {{awareness}} for mental health charity Mind. Although not suffering himself, he was inspired to raise awareness about depression after the suicides of sportsmen Gary Speed and Peter Roebuck. He was also frustrated by people such as Piers Morgan showing a lack of comprehension about depression <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> impact on {{people from all walks of}} life. He started the walk in September and completed it in December. For part of the walk he was joined by fellow cricketers, including Paul Nixon.|$|E
25|$|Currently, the {{availability}} of drugs proven to treat neuropathic pain is limited and varies widely from patient to patient. Many developed drugs have either been discovered by accident or by observation. Some past treatments include opiates like poppy extract, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like salicylic acid, and local anesthetics like cocaine. Other recent treatments consist of antidepressants and anticonvulsants, although no substantial research on the actual mechanism of these treatments has been performed. However, patients respond to these treatments differently, possibly because of gender differences or genetic backgrounds. Therefore, researchers {{have come to realize}} that no one drug or one class of drugs will reduce all pain. Research is now focusing on the underlying mechanisms involved in pain perception <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> go wrong in order to develop an appropriate drug for patients afflicted with neuropathic pain.|$|E

25|$|Harriet Powers, a slave-born African American woman, {{made two}} famous story quilts. She {{was just one}} of the many African-American quilters who contributed to the {{evolution}} of quilting. The first nationwide recognition of African-American quiltmaking came when the Gee's Bend quilting community was celebrated in an exhibition that opened in 2002 and travelled to many museums, including the Smithsonian. Gee's Bend is a small, isolated community of African-Americans in southern Alabama with a quiltmaking tradition that goes back several generations and is characterized by pattern improvisation, multiple patterning, bright and contrasting colors, visual motion, and a lack of rules. The contributions made by Harriet Powers and others quilters of Gee's Bend, Alabama have been recognized by the US Postal Service with a series of stamps. The communal nature of the quilting process (<b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> bring together women of varied races and backgrounds) was honored in the series of stamps.|$|E
25|$|McLuhan {{writes about}} robotism {{in the context}} of Japanese Zen Buddhism <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> offer us new ways of {{thinking}} about technology. The Western way of thinking about technology is too much related to the left hemisphere of our brain, which has a rational and linear focus. What he called robotism might better be called androidism in the wake of Blade Runner and the novels of Philip K. Dick. Robotism-androidism emerges from the further development of the right hemisphere of the brain, creativity and a new relationship to spacetime (most humans are still living in 17th century classical Newtonian physics spacetime). Robots-androids will have much greater flexibility than humans have had until now, in both mind and body. Robots-androids will teach humanity this new flexibility. And this flexibility of androids (what McLuhan calls robotism) has a strong affinity with Japanese culture and life. McLuhan quotes from Ruth Benedict, The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, an anthropological study of Japanese culture published in 1946: “Occidentals cannot easily credit the ability of the Japanese to swing from one behavior to another without psychic cost. Such extreme possibilities are not included in our experience. Yet in Japanese life the contradictions, as they seem to us, are as deeply based in their view of life as our uniformities are in ours.” The ability to live in the present and instantly readjust.|$|E
