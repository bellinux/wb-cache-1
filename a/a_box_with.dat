After a few more jump cuts in which they turn to the right and back again, the figure stands still, then looks to its left slowly. The figure looks down to where <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>with</b> various triangular sections appears, then to their right as the image seems to fragment briefly. For the remainder of the video, the cloaked figure stands still with its back to the wall, with the camera apparently handheld again and occasional video effects briefly doubling the image.|$|E

The Rulebook was also available for separate sale, hard-cover {{in the first}} printing and soft-cover after that. After the fifth edition, this edition put the emphasis back on troop movement and combat: heroes and wizards were still important but became incapable of winning games in their own right. There was also an all-new magic system based on dice rolling.|$|E

However, the idents consisted of a set of simple graphical 3s in a domino effect with different colours such as grey, purple and blue. The idents were produced by Image Now.|$|E
25|$|Story Gathering Boxes, an ongoing, {{participatory}} artwork, {{was initiated}} in 1972. Each piece {{in this series}} consists of <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>with</b> four chambers made out of poplar wood. The chambers contain wooden tablets or paper cards. The wooden tablets display imagery and themes centered on spirituality, gender and goddess-based narratives. The imagery is created out of mixed media like paint and leather. The paper cards contain prompts, inviting viewers to contribute personal stories on various topics, such as gender, domestic violence, and immigration. This series democratizes access to art by allowing all viewers {{to participate in the}} creation of a collective narrative.|$|E

[...] Ezarik is a heavy user who typically sends and receives tens of thousands of text messages a month, which generated an exceptionally long, $275 bill – 300 double-sided pages that had to be sent in <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>with</b> postage charges of $7.|$|E

500|$|The 37-inch {{cyclotron}} at Berkeley was dismantled on 24 November 1941, and its magnet used {{to create}} the first calutron. Its name came from California University and cyclotron. The work was initially funded by the Radiation Laboratory from its own resources, with a $5,000 grant from the Research Corporation. In December Lawrence received a $400,000 grant from the S-1 Uranium Committee. The calutron consisted of an ion source, {{in the form of}} <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>with</b> a slit in it and hot filaments inside. Uranium tetrachloride was ionized by the filament, and then passed through a [...] slot into a vacuum chamber. The magnet was then used to deflect the ion beam by 180°. The enriched and depleted beams went into collectors.|$|E
500|$|In the novel, Pinfold {{initially}} {{dismisses the}} Box—described as resembling [...] "a makeshift wireless set"—as [...] "a lot of harmless nonsense", but, like Waugh, he is driven to revise {{his position in}} the face of his persecution by the voices. He believes that [...] "Angel" [...] is using an adapted form of the Box, as developed by the Germans {{at the end of the}} war and perfected by the [...] "Existentialists" [...] in Paris—"a hellish invention in the wrong hands". At the end of his ordeal Pinfold muses that had he not defied Angel but instead compromised with him, he might have continued to believe in the Box's sinister capabilities. He is finally convinced of the non-existence of <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>with</b> such powers by the assurances of his priest, Father Westmacott.|$|E
500|$|The game itself {{also has}} an {{alternate}} reality counterpart. Within the game are radio frequencies that hint to a real phone number. This phone number led players to the Twitter account @xray9169363733. The account posted various cryptic, coded messages, all of which seemed to point to a real world location. On May 7, 2016, Youtuber Jesse Cox posted a video similar to the PS4 Oxenfree trailer, but with several letters highlighted in red. This led players to www.edwardsisland.com. Several messages were found, but most important was [...] "MILNER IS WARD", confirming that a special object would be hidden at Fort Ward, WA. The object was revealed to be <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>with</b> letters by Alex from all the possible timelines from the game warning her {{not to go to}} Edwards island, and a manually operated tape player with two paper music tapes of songs from the game soundtrack.|$|E

The sides of the citadel were the [...] "armoured belt" [...] of the ship, which started on the hull {{just in front of}} the forward turret and ran to just behind the aft turret. The ends of the citadel were two armoured bulkheads, fore and aft, which stretched between the ends of the armour belt. The [...] "roof" [...] of the citadel was an armoured deck.

500|$|Homer captures Molloy at the {{retirement}} home, and the surprisingly amiable cat burglar returns the objects he stole. Chief Wiggum arrests {{him and he}} is imprisoned. While in his cell at the police station, Molloy casually mentions that he assumes Homer and the cops probably {{want to know where}} he hid all of his loot. This piques their interest, and Molloy tells them the stash is hidden under a giant [...] "T" [...] somewhere in Springfield. They all rush out of the station hoping to get the treasure for themselves. In a matter of minutes the entire town hears of the existence of Molloy's stash and almost everybody in Springfield is racing to get there first.

500|$|Slovenian singer Maja Slatinšek {{had entered}} her song, [...] "Time to Rise", {{composed}} by herself and Ziga Pirnat, into {{not only the}} Irish final, but also the Slovenian and Romanian finals as well. Slovenian broadcaster Radiotelevizija Slovenija (RTV SLO) did not choose Slatinšek's song to compete in EMA 2008, the Slovenian final, but RTÉ and the Romanian broadcaster Televiziunea Română (TVR) allowed her to compete in their respective national finals. Slatinšek withdrew from the Romanian final, with her and Pirnat saying that the chance of competing in Ireland was {{higher than that of}} Romania, with the Romanian national final, Selecţia Naţională 2008, containing 24 songs over two semi-finals. The [...] "possibility of being among the Irish finalists, one of the biggest powers in Eurovision, was an offer we could not turn down," [...] said Slatinšek. Slatinšek's performance involved her singing {{for the first half of}} the song with four male dancers coming in later on, and performing artistic moves around her. The end of the performance involved her being raised on <b>a</b> <b>box,</b> <b>with</b> her plain white dress being lowered over it.|$|E
