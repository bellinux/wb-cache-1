We ended up at a place where Sally Kellerman (before she became a star) was working as a waitress, and as Chuck and I vied with each other, trying to top each other’s sardonic or subversive ideas, appealing to Sally as a referee, she sat down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> us, and the three of us worked {{out the rest of the}} story together.|$|E
5|$|There {{are obvious}} {{connections}} {{in the design of}} the Slaying of Holofernes and the Slaying of Haman at the opposite end of the chapel. Although in the Holofernes picture the figures are smaller and the space less filled, both have the triangular space divided into two zones by a vertical wall, allowing us to see what is happening on both sides of it. There are actually three scenes in the Haman picture because as well as seeing Haman punished, we see him <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> Esther and the King and get a view of the King on his bed. Mordechai sits on the steps, making a link between the scenes.|$|E

500|$|Bishop's {{undergraduate}} {{work with}} Hickson {{was her first}} major research effort, concerning the reproduction of Spirostomum ambiguum, a large ciliate that {{has been described as}} [...] "wormlike". In 1923, while working at Manchester University, Bishop was appointed an honorary research fellow. In 1924, she became a part-time instructor for the Department of Zoology at Cambridge, one of only two women, both of whom were sometimes marginalised. For example, she was not allowed to sit <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> the men of the department at tea: instead, she sat on a first-aid kit. There, Bishop continued her work with Spirostomum as the only protozoologist on the faculty.|$|E

[...] Ne-Yo further stated that Rihanna is not afraid to trying new things and from the first moment she heard the song he knew she would like it, [...] "I trust Rihanna to be Rihanna, and she trusts me to be me. That's the coolest thing about our relationship. I must say this song is a step in somewhat of a different direction for both of us." [...] When Harmony heard the song, both he and Ne-Yo were aware that they should change some elements and that it had to be darker and edgier.|$|E

2500|$|As Wright philosophized of {{this period}} some thirty years later, 'Having a witness among the poor and having a {{ministry}} to the poor is one thing, but making the poor folks members of your congregation is something else altogether." [...] Wright further explained, [...] "Failure to have the black poor <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> you as equals means you are doing missionary work," [...] while having [...] "poor black folks" [...] who [...] "sit {{down at the table}} as equals" [...] means you are [...] "serious about talking or doing [...] black theology." [...] As Speller explains, Trinity's congregants [...] "began to slowly move away from the concept of church as a place to enhance and validate their social position to one that appreciated the church as a place for spiritual formation." [...] In sum, Trinity began to more fully move away from its earlier purpose surrounding [...] "middle-classness" [...] to one where devotion to God and the poor took much greater prominence.|$|E
