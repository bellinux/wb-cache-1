5|$|Patricia McKinsey Crittenden has {{elaborated}} classifications {{of further}} forms of avoidant and ambivalent attachment behaviour. These include the caregiving and punitive behaviours also identified by Main and Cassidy (termed A3 and C3 respectively), but also other patterns such as compulsive {{compliance with the}} wishes of <b>a</b> <b>threatening</b> parent (A4).|$|E
5|$|The chapter {{describes}} animals {{including the}} puss moth caterpillar which combines <b>a</b> <b>threatening</b> display with camouflage {{and the ability}} to eject an irritant fluid for protection. Poulton also discusses the lobster moth caterpillar.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{pelicans}} rely on visual {{displays and}} behaviour to communicate, particularly using their wings and bills. Agonistic behaviour consists of thrusting and snapping at opponents with their bills, or lifting and waving their wings in <b>a</b> <b>threatening</b> manner. Adult pelicans grunt when at the colony, but are generally silent elsewhere or outside breeding season. Conversely, colonies are noisy as chicks vocalise extensively.|$|E

5|$|Dinosaurs began {{appearing}} in films {{soon after the}} introduction of cinema, the first being the good-natured animated Gertie the Dinosaur in 1914. However, lovable dinosaurs were quickly replaced by monsters as moviemakers recognized the potential of huge frightening monsters. D. W. Griffith in 1914's Brute Force provided the first example of <b>a</b> <b>threatening</b> cinematic dinosaur, a Ceratosaurus who menaced cavemen. This film enshrined the fiction that dinosaurs and early humans lived together, {{and set up the}} cliché that dinosaurs were bloodthirsty and attacked anything that moved.|$|E
5|$|In later medieval prayers, Elves {{appear as}} <b>a</b> <b>threatening,</b> even demonic, force. For example, there are prayers which invoke God's help against noctural attacks by Alpe. Correspondingly, {{in the early}} modern period, elves are {{described}} in north Germany doing the evil bidding of witches; Martin Luther believed his mother to have been afflicted in this way.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, {{the news}} media descend on the town and a police investigation begins. Meanwhile, Sidney Prescott struggles with the impending first anniversary of her mother's murder by Cotton Weary. While waiting at home for her friend, Tatum Riley, Sidney receives <b>a</b> <b>threatening</b> phone call. After she hangs up she is attacked by the killer, but manages to escape. Sidney's boyfriend, Billy Loomis, arrives shortly after, but after he drops his cell phone, Sidney suspects him of making the call and flees. Billy is arrested and Sidney spends the night at Tatum's house.|$|E

5|$|As the Cardiff team bus {{arrived at}} the stadium, the fans threw leeks at the vehicle. The team had adopted a black cat for the occasion, which Ferguson had found {{wandering}} astray prior to their earlier match with Bolton and decided {{it was a good}} omen. He found the owners of the animal, who agreed to let the club keep the cat in return for two final tickets if they progressed that far. Police reinforcements were required at Empire Stadium, as at 1pm {{a large number of people}} had gathered outside the ticket office in <b>a</b> <b>threatening</b> manner. A large number of fake tickets had been sold to members of the crowd, and the stewards were refusing to allow them entry.|$|E
5|$|Curtis, {{inspired}} {{by the fact that}} Van Gogh never knew he would be famous, had the idea for an episode centred on him. He left the script open to criticism from the crew and made many revisions as a result. Curtis wanted to portray Van Gogh truthfully, rather than being cruel by writing jokes about his mental illness. Most of the episode was filmed in Trogir, Croatia, and many of the sets were modelled after Van Gogh paintings. The episode was watched by 6.76 million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD. Reception to the episode varied, ranging from very positive to mixed to very negative. While the amount of emotion in the episode was debated, many reviewers agreed that Curran's performance as Van Gogh was excellent, but that the Krafayis was not <b>a</b> <b>threatening</b> monster.|$|E
5|$|Low {{challenged}} the Prime Minister over the Suez issue, {{accusing him of}} sending <b>a</b> <b>threatening</b> telegram that caused British Prime Minister Anthony Eden to back off the invasion and so gave the Soviets {{the opportunity for a}} military buildup in Egypt. St. Laurent angrily denied the charge and offered to open his correspondence to any of the fifty privy councillors who could then announce whether St. Laurent was telling the truth. Low took St. Laurent up on his challenge, and selected the only living former Prime Minister, Tory Arthur Meighen, but the matter was not resolved before the election, and Meighen was not called upon to examine the correspondence in the election's aftermath.|$|E

5|$|The {{adult male}} and female both are active in {{protecting}} and feeding the fledged chicks until they learn to forage on their own. The adult robin gives alarm calls and dives in <b>a</b> <b>threatening</b> manner towards creatures it considers potential predators, such as approaching cats, dogs and humans. The fledglings are able to fly short distances after leaving the nest. The wings of juvenile birds develop rapidly, and it only takes {{a couple of weeks}} for them to become proficient at flying. The cryptically colored young birds perch in bushes or trees for protection from predators.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Madonna {{witnessing}} {{a young woman}} being robbed and murdered {{by a group of}} men, but she is too frozen in fear to protest. A black man walking down the alley also sees the incident and runs to help the woman, but the murderers flee just as the police arrive. The police mistakenly suspect the black man of being the killer and arrest him. The real murderers give <b>a</b> <b>threatening</b> look towards Madonna and leave. She flees the crime scene and escapes to a church. There she sees a caged statue of saint who resembles the black man on the street. As the song starts, she utters a prayer in front of the statue which appears to be crying.|$|E
5|$|After {{repeated}} {{attempts to}} reach Derek on his phone, Sharon finds Derek {{at the hospital}} and suspects that he and Lisa had an affair, as Lisa claims. LAPD Detective Monica Reese (Christine Lahti) at first questions Derek's fidelity to Sharon as well, but soon becomes skeptical of Lisa's claims, due to inconsistencies in her side of the story, and informs Derek of her belief in him. Sharon, refusing to believe Derek, kicks him out of their house, and he moves into a separate apartment. Months later, Derek and Sharon meet up for dinner and finally reconcile. Meanwhile, Lisa tricks the babysitter Samantha (Scout Taylor-Compton) into letting her in under the pretense of being one of Sharon's friends. When Derek and Sharon return home after dinner, they discover that Lisa had been in the house and seemingly abducted Derek and Sharon's infant son, Kyle (Nathan and Nicolas Myers). Derek goes to his car with the intent to pursue Lisa, only to find the baby is safely sitting in the back seat. He and Sharon immediately take Kyle to the hospital for a check-up. When Derek and Sharon return home from the hospital, they find Lisa has trashed their bedroom and removed Sharon's face from their family portrait. Sharon leaves <b>a</b> <b>threatening</b> voice message on Lisa's phone, and she and Derek set up a home alarm system.|$|E

5|$|Having {{discovered}} a lost briefcase in a park, Tintin returns {{it to its}} owner, the sigillographer Professor Hector Alembick, who informs the reporter of his plans {{to travel to the}} Balkan nation of Syldavia. Tintin discovers secret agents spying on him and follows those responsible to a nearby Syldavian restaurant. An unknown man agrees to meet with Tintin, but is found unconscious. Shortly after, the reporter receives <b>a</b> <b>threatening</b> note and is then the target of a bomb attack; but survives the latter when police detectives Thomson and Thompson intercept the bomb. Suspecting that these events are linked to Syldavia, Tintin decides to accompany Professor Alembick on his forthcoming visit to the country. On the plane journey there, Tintin notices Alembick acting out of character, and suspects that an imposter has replaced him. Reading a brochure on Syldavian history, Tintin theorises that the imposter is part of a plot to steal the sceptre of the Medieval King Ottokar IV from the current King Muskar XII before St. Vladimir's Day, thus forcing him to abdicate.|$|E
5|$|Males take up nesting sites {{before the}} {{breeding}} season, by frequently calling beside them. Unmated males start nest construction and call particularly frequently to attract females. When a female approaches a male during this period, the male displays by {{moving up and}} down while drooping and shivering his wings, pushing up his head, raising and spreading his tail, and showing his bib. Males may try to mate with females while calling or displaying. In response, a female will adopt <b>a</b> <b>threatening</b> posture and attack a male before flying away, pursued by the male. The male displays in front of her, attracting other males, which also pursue and display to the female. This group display usually does not immediately result in copulations. Other males usually do not copulate with the female. Copulation is typically initiated by the female giving a soft dee-dee-dee call to the male. Birds of a pair copulate frequently until the female is laying eggs, and the male mounts the female repeatedly each time a pair mates.|$|E
5|$|On January 12, 2011 Itzhak and Meir Abergil, {{together}} with Sasson Barashy, Moshe Malul and Israel Ozifa, were extradited to the US, arriving in Los Angeles on January 13, aboard an American government airplane. They {{were being held}} in the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles, facing a 77-page, 32-count federal indictment that alleges murder, massive embezzlement, money laundering, racketeering and running a large Los Angeles-based Ecstasy ring. The trial was set for November 8, 2011 in the Los Angeles Federal District Court. If convicted, they may face life imprisonment, but not the death penalty, as US authorities have promised their Israeli counterparts that even if found guilty of murder, the five suspects would not be given the death penalty. Under {{the terms of the}} extradition agreement, they would likely serve their sentence in an Israeli prison. Shortly after the extradition, <b>a</b> <b>threatening</b> letter was found under the car of the wife of the Prosecutor who was involved in the extradition.|$|E

5|$|On March 13, the Polish {{government}} issued <b>a</b> <b>threatening</b> statement accusing Lithuania of provocation. On {{the following}} day, the Senate of the Republic of Poland {{called for the}} establishment of diplomatic relations and for the Lithuanian renunciation of claims to Vilnius. Upon receiving news that Poland was considering extreme measures, President Smetona was verging towards agreeing to discuss diplomatic relations, but changed his mind at almost the last minute. On the night of March 14, the Lithuanians, acting through France's envoy to Warsaw, proposed a commission to investigate the shooting incident and to agree on measures to avoid such incidents in the future. This was a partial measure that clearly did not satisfy Poland, which responded by refusing, in the first paragraph of the ultimatum delivered three days later, to establish such a commission. At the same time Lithuanian diplomats approached foreign powers in a bid for international support.|$|E
5|$|Robert and his mysterious friend Bertram {{are among}} a group of knights who are {{preparing}} to compete in a tournament for the hand of Princess Isabelle. They all praise wine, women and gambling (Versez à tasses pleines). Robert's attendant Raimbaut sings a ballad about a beautiful princess from Normandy who married a devil; the princess had a son, Robert, known as 'le diable'. Robert indignantly reveals that he is the son in question and condemns Raimbaut to death. Raimbaut begs for pardon and tells Robert that he is engaged to marry. Robert relents and relishes the thought of the droit du seigneur. Raimbaut's fianceé arrives; Robert recognizes her as his foster-sister Alice and pardons Raimbaut. Alice tells Robert that his mother has died and that her last words were a warning about <b>a</b> <b>threatening</b> dark force (Va! Va! dit-elle). She offers Robert his mother's will. Robert is too overcome to read it and asks Alice to keep it for the present. Robert expresses his longing for his beloved Isabelle and Alice offers to take a letter to her. Alice warns Robert to beware of Bertram but he ignores her. With Bertram's encouragement, Robert gambles with the knights and loses all of his money, as well as his armour.|$|E
5|$|Stanton wanted EVE {{to be at}} {{the higher}} end of technology, and asked iPod {{designer}} Jonathan Ive to inspect her design. He was very impressed. Her eyes are modelled on Lite-Brite toys, but Pixar chose not to make them overly expressive as it would be too easy to have her eyes turn into hearts to express love or something similar. Her limited design meant the animators had to treat her like a drawing, relying on posing her body to express emotion. They also found her similar to a manatee or a narwhal because her floating body resembled an underwater creature. Auto was a conscious homage to HAL 9000 from , and the usage of Also sprach Zarathustra for the showdown between the captain and Auto furthers that. The manner in which he hangs from a wall gives him <b>a</b> <b>threatening</b> feel, like a spider. Originally, Auto was designed entirely differently, resembling EVE, but masculine and authoritative; the Steward robots were also more aggressive Patrol-bots. The majority of the robot cast were formed with the Build-a-bot program, where different heads, arms and treads were combined together in over a hundred variations. The humans were modelled on sea lions due to their blubbery bodies, as well as babies. The filmmakers noticed baby fat is a lot tighter than adult fat and copied that texture for the film's humans.|$|E
