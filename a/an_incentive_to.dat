40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the case for}} R&D subsidies in export sectors when the outcome of R&D is uncertain and the product market is oligopolistic. When R&D reduces expected costs in the particular sense of lirst-order stochastic dominance, a national strategic basis for R&D subsidies exists, whether firms choose prices or quantities. This must be balanced against <b>a</b> corrective <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> tax R&D whenever the number of domestic firms exceeds one. However, when R&D increases the riskiness of the cost distribution as well, the results may switch: there emerges <b>a</b> strategic <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> tax and <b>a</b> corrective <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> subsidize R&D. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} R&D {{behavior of}} public firms by using oligopoly models with Cournot−type−quantity and Bertrand−type−price competition. Then the following results are obtained. When {{public and private}} firms in a mixed oligopoly market are involved in quantity competition, (i) the public firm has <b>a</b> greater <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> invest in cost−reducing R&D in a public monopoly market than in that market if they are substitutes, and (ii) the public firm has <b>a</b> less <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> invest in R&D in the oligopoly market if they are complements. Furthermore, suppose that public and private firms in a mixed oligopoly market are involved in price competition. (i) If the products are complements, then a public firm has <b>a</b> greater <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> invest in cost−reducing R&D in the public monopoly market than in the mixed oligopoly market; and (ii) if they are substitutes, then the public firm has <b>a</b> less <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> invest in cost−reducing R&D in the public monopoly market than in the mixed oligopoly market...|$|R

Since September 2006, in <b>an</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> rectify sliding retention rates, Reservist salaries have been streamlined with those of regular forces as a reflection of overall higher standard of training. This initiative shows that in recent decades, there are now many positions for which there is little training gap at all between Reservists and Permanent Force members.

Behan's sympathy to the Cowboys was well known, and during the trial he firmly denied he had contributed money to help Ike with his defense costs.

5|$|For example, in most {{underdeveloped}} economies, {{the technology}} {{used to carry}} out agricultural activities is backward. There is a low degree of mechanisation coupled with rain dependence. So while {{a large proportion of}} the population (70-80%) may be actively employed in the agriculture sector, the contribution to the Gross Domestic Product may be as low as 40%. This points to the need to increase output per unit input and output per head. This can be done if the government provides irrigation facilities, high-yielding variety seeds, pesticides, fertilisers, tractors etc. The positive outcome of this is that farmers earn more income and have a higher purchasing power (real income). Their demand for other products in the economy will rise and this will provide industrialists <b>an</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> invest in that country. Thus, the size of the market expands and improves the condition of the underdeveloped country.|$|E

5|$|In May 1716, the Emperor {{assured the}} Electress and the Grand Duke {{that there was}} no insurmountable {{obstacle}} preventing her accession, but that Austria and Tuscany must soon reach an agreement regarding which royal house which was to succeed the Medici. As <b>an</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> accelerate Cosimo's reply, the Emperor hinted that Tuscany would reap territorial advancements. In June 1717 Cosimo declared his wish that the House of Este should succeed. Charles VI's promises never materialised. In 1718 he repudiated Cosimo's decision, declaring a union between Tuscany and Modena (the Este lands) unacceptable. On 4 April 1718 England, France and the Dutch Republic (and later Austria) selected Don Carlos of Spain, the eldest child of Elisabeth Farnese and Philip V of Spain, as the Tuscan heir. By 1722 the Electress was not even acknowledged as heiress, and Cosimo was reduced to spectator at the conferences for Tuscany's future.|$|E

When the police banner later disappeared, there were reports that the site's management had taken it down, although the management stated that it had fallen under a hard wind.

According to FETA's chairman Lawrence Marshall, the system would provide the most efficiency, claiming that 80% of peak-time journeys are made by single-occupant vehicles. The proposal, passed with the chairman's casting vote after the committee was deadlocked, was referred to the Scottish Executive in December 2005, and implementation planned for October 2007 subject to approval by transport minister Tavish Scott. Environmental groups welcomed the proposal, although local politicians condemned it as simply a means of raising capital. At the same time, a counter-argument was tabled by Fife councillors proposing the complete removal of tolls.|$|E
