5|$|After her commissioning, Bayern {{served with}} the fleet on {{numerous}} training exercises and cruises. She participated in several cruises escorting Kaiser Wilhelm II on state visits to Great Britain and to various cities in the Baltic Sea in the late 1880s and early 1890s. During 1895–1898, the ship was modernized at the Schichau-Werke dockyard in Danzig; she served for <b>another</b> <b>decade</b> with the fleet before being withdrawn from active service in 1910. She {{was used as a}} target ship after 1911, until she was sold in 1919 and broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Hifz-ur Rahman {{was laid}} up in Constantinople. She was refit at the Imperial Arsenal in 18911894, but was {{nevertheless}} in poor condition by {{the outbreak of}} the Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, {{like the rest of the}} ancient Ottoman ironclad fleet. As a result, the fleet was kept safely behind the Dardanelles forts and it saw no action. The ship remained in service for <b>another</b> <b>decade</b> until she was decommissioned in 1909; she was sold in November that year to ship breakers and thereafter dismantled.|$|E
5|$|Tallon {{retired in}} {{dramatic}} circumstances {{after the first}} match of the 195354 Sheffield Shield season. During the match, he suddenly took off his gloves and handed the keeping duties to Peter Burge. He scored 21 and 54 not out in a drawn match against New South Wales. Two months later, he played for Arthur Morris's XI against Hassett's XI, a testimonial match for the latter. Tallon made 17 not out and nine in a 121-run win. Tallon continued to play local cricket in Bundaberg for <b>another</b> <b>decade.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Douglas plant {{closed in}} 1968, depriving Santa Monica of its largest employer. A decade passed before {{the site was}} redeveloped into an office park. The Museum of Flying was opened on the same site <b>another</b> <b>decades</b> later, in 1989.|$|R
50|$|After <b>another</b> two <b>decades</b> of use, {{the bridge}} was rehabilitated under a project of the National Road Fund Agency funded by Danish aid.|$|R
50|$|Although the Unitarians exiled in {{neighboring}} countries, the Civil War would continue for <b>another</b> two <b>decades,</b> the Unitarians {{being led by}} Lavalle, Paz, Lamadrid, and many others.|$|R
5|$|The Regia Marina demobilized {{after the}} end of the war in 1918 and the {{draw-down}} continued into the 1920s in large part due to severe budgetary shortfalls in the postwar period. The engines installed on Nino Bixio and her sister proved to be problematic throughout her time in service, which ultimately cut her career short. She was stricken from the naval register on 15 March 1929 and subsequently broken up for scrap; in contrast, the much more efficient Quarto, which had been built before Nino Bixio, remained in service for <b>another</b> <b>decade.</b>|$|E
5|$|Authoritarian rule {{under the}} Kuomintang ended {{gradually}} through {{a transition to}} democracy, which was marked by the lifting of martial law in 1987. Soon after, the KMT transitioned to being merely one party within a democratic system, though maintaining {{a high degree of}} power in aboriginal districts through an established system of patronage networks. The KMT continued to hold the reins of power for <b>another</b> <b>decade</b> under President Lee Teng-hui. However, they did so as an elected government rather than a dictatorial power. The elected KMT government supported many of the bills that had been promoted by aboriginal groups. The tenth amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China also stipulates that the government would protect and preserve aboriginal culture and languages and also encourage them to participate in politics.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortunes}} of the LSA had begun to decline by 1920 when Boyce hired the first professional editor for Lone Scout, George N. Madison. Madison discovered that the LSA's membership roster was wildly inaccurate: {{it was full of}} duplications and inactive members. The reported 490,000 Lone Scouts in 1922 was a vastly inflated number. Boyce finally accepted West's annual offer to merge with the BSA in April 1924, with the merger formalized on June 16, 1924. Some Lone Scouts did not transfer to the BSA, but the BSA continued Lone Scouting as a separate division for <b>another</b> <b>decade,</b> gradually losing its unique programs. Present day Lone Scouts use the standard Cub Scouting and Boy Scouting programs and activities, but are not part of a pack or troop on a regular basis because of factors such as distance, weather, time, disability or other difficulties.|$|E
50|$|The Dominion of Newfoundland (not {{to be part}} of Canada for <b>another</b> three <b>decades)</b> had a National Government during World War I led by Edward Patrick Morris.|$|R

5|$|The {{two ships}} entered service in 1916, and were based in Taranto {{with the rest}} of the main fleet for the {{duration}} of World War I. Both ships were involved in the Corfu incident in 1923. The ships' modernization work was completed after Italy entered World War II. Caio Duilio was damaged at the Battle of Taranto, while Andrea Doria was not hit. Both ships were present at the First Battle of Sirte, though only Andrea Doria engaged British forces. The two ships survived the war, and were the only battleships the Allies permitted Italy to retain after the conclusion of hostilities. They served in the Italian Navy for <b>another</b> <b>decade</b> until they were discarded in the mid-1950s.|$|E
5|$|While the Suez Crisis caused British {{power in}} the Middle East to weaken, it did not collapse. Britain again {{deployed}} its armed forces to the region, intervening in Oman (1957), Jordan (1958) and Kuwait (1961), though on these occasions with American approval, as the new Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's foreign policy was to remain firmly aligned with the United States. Britain maintained a {{military presence in the}} Middle East for <b>another</b> <b>decade.</b> On 16 January 1968, {{a few weeks after the}} devaluation of the pound, Prime Minister Harold Wilson and his Defence Secretary Denis Healey announced that British troops would be withdrawn from major military bases East of Suez, which included the ones in the Middle East, and primarily from Malaysia and Singapore by the end of 1971, instead of 1975 as earlier planned. By that time over 50,000 British military personnel were still stationed in the Far East, including 30,000 in Singapore. The British withdrew from Aden in 1967, Bahrain in 1971, and the Maldives in 1976.|$|E
25|$|The Metric System {{was adopted}} under the 1976 Metrication Ordinance. Subsequently, {{many of the}} wet markets and {{traditional}} Chinese medicine shops used the old Chinese system for at least <b>another</b> <b>decade.</b>|$|E

50|$|The key {{components}} of free flight were identified in 1971 by United Airlines systems manager William Cotton, although the technology to implement it was not available for <b>another</b> two <b>decades.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{the face}} of Ó Lochlainn opposition, Aodh's son Domhnall Óg (died 1234) ruled for four years after his death. Following yet <b>another</b> <b>decade</b> of strife, Aodh's nephew Brian Ruadh once again {{established}} Ó Néill dominance in the province, a dominance that would last {{until the end of}} the kingdom in the 17th century.|$|E
25|$|Work on {{the ambitious}} 2,400km two-lane Trans-Arunachal Highway Project {{announced}} by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on 31 January 2008 on his maiden {{visit to the}} state, {{was scheduled to be}} completed by 2015–16 but now due to political and social reasons it may take <b>another</b> <b>decade.</b> New longest India bridge is already constructed because of prime minister Narendra modi on 28 May 2017.|$|E
25|$|By 1845, the Quequechan's {{power had}} been all but maximized. The Massasoit Steam Mill was {{established}} in 1846, above the dam {{near the end of}} Pleasant Street. However, it would be <b>another</b> <b>decade</b> or so when improvements in the steam engine by George Corliss would enable the construction of the first large steam-powered mill in the city, the Union Mills in 1859.|$|E
50|$|However, it took until 1903 {{when the}} SPR officially {{organised}} football as a leisure activity for its employees and <b>another</b> one-and-a-half <b>decades</b> when a proper football club was formed on 16 February 1919.|$|R
2500|$|Nevertheless, gay men {{and lesbians}} {{continued}} to live closeted lives, since moral and social disapproval by heterosexual society remained strong across Europe for <b>another</b> two <b>decades,</b> until the modern gay rights movement began in 1969.|$|R
50|$|Kasko {{remained}} with the Red Sox for <b>another</b> two <b>decades,</b> however, as a scout (1974-77), director of scouting (1977-92) and vice president, baseball development (1992-94). He {{was named to}} the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2010.|$|R
25|$|During the {{deadlock}} of four years, the Second Party System broke up, Mormon pioneers settled Utah, the California Gold Rush settled northern California, and New Mexico under {{a federal}} military government turned back Texas's attempt to assert control over territory Texas claimed as far west as the Rio Grande. The eventual compromise preserved the Union {{but only for}} <b>another</b> <b>decade.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1981, Iran {{cut off all}} {{diplomatic}} ties with Rabat in response to King Hassan II's decision to give asylum to the exiled Shah. A decade later, diplomatic {{relations between the two}} nations were renewed, but <b>another</b> <b>decade</b> would have to pass before Abderrahmane Youssoufi, the prime minister of Morocco, would lead the first Moroccan delegation to the Islamic Republic of Iran.|$|E
25|$|Efforts to redevelop {{the docks}} began {{almost as soon}} as they were closed, {{although}} it took a decade for most plans to move beyond the drawing board and <b>another</b> <b>decade</b> for redevelopment to take full effect. The situation was greatly complicated by the large number of landowners involved: the PLA, the Greater London Council (GLC), the British Gas Corporation, five borough councils, British Rail and the Central Electricity Generating Board.|$|E
50|$|The Federalists left {{a lasting}} legacy {{in the form}} of a strong federal {{government}} with a sound financial base, and after losing executive power they decisively shaped Supreme Court policy for <b>another</b> three <b>decades</b> through the person of Chief Justice John Marshall.|$|R
50|$|The {{election}} {{marked the}} end of the Liberals' long dominance of federal politics in Quebec, a province which had been the bedrock of Liberal support for almost a century; they did not win a majority of Quebec seats again for <b>another</b> three <b>decades.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Although re-elected to the National Committee in 1969 {{despite his}} {{contention}} that the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia had been [...] "a very serious blunder," [...] Green later quit the National Committee, although he remained {{a member of the}} Communist Party for <b>another</b> two <b>decades.</b>|$|R
25|$|One of Pitt’s {{first major}} actions as Prime Minister was, in 1785, {{to put a}} scheme of {{parliamentary}} reform before the Commons, proposing to rationalise somewhat the existing, decidedly unrepresentative, electoral system by eliminating thirty-six rotten boroughs and redistributing seats to represent London and the larger counties. Fox supported Pitt’s reforms, despite apparent political expediency, but they were defeated by 248 to 174. Reform would not be considered seriously by Parliament for <b>another</b> <b>decade.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although he {{remained}} in the Diet for <b>another</b> <b>decade</b> and a half, his influence gradually waned. In 2003, despite a fight, Nakasone was not given {{a place on the}} LDP's electoral list as the party introduced an age limit of 73 years for candidates in the proportional representation blocks. This ended his career {{as a member of the}} Diet. The move was widely seen as a blunt and effective attack by Jun'ichirō Koizumi on the old guard LDP leadership.|$|E
25|$|The French {{campaign}} against Korea was an 1866 punitive expedition {{undertaken by the}} Second French Empire {{in retaliation for the}} earlier Korean execution of several French Catholic missionaries. The encounter over Ganghwa Island lasted nearly six weeks. The result was a French retreat and a check on French influence in the region. The encounter also confirmed Korea in its isolationism for <b>another</b> <b>decade,</b> until Japan forced it to open up to trade in 1876 through the Treaty of Ganghwa.|$|E
50|$|The Warren {{brothers}} both {{died in the}} mid-1830s. After {{a series}} of transactions that briefly took John's property out of the family, by 1854 {{it was back in}} the family, owned by his son-in-law John Nelson. Samuel's home remained in his descendants' hands for <b>another</b> four <b>decades.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{a strong}} decade Wednesday won the league {{twice in the}} 1902-03 and 1903-04 seasons and the FA Cup again in 1907, beating Everton, again at Crystal Palace by two goals to one. After this a {{relatively}} fallow period was to be suffered for <b>another</b> two <b>decades.</b>|$|R
50|$|The use of {{the north-south}} {{corridor}} for a road was a dead concept until GDOT brought it up again in 2010 {{in the form of}} a tunnel (see below); the discussion around a road in the east-west corridor was, however, to continue for <b>another</b> two <b>decades.</b>|$|R
