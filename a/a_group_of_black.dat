5|$|Born in Watts, Los Angeles, to {{a middle-class}} African-American family, Sylvester {{developed}} {{a love of}} singing through the gospel choir of his Pentecostal church. Leaving the church after the congregation expressed disapproval of his homosexuality, he found friendship among <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> cross-dressers and transgender women who called themselves The Disquotays. Moving to San Francisco in 1970 {{at the age of}} 22, Sylvester embraced the counterculture and joined the avant-garde drag troupe The Cockettes, producing solo segments of their shows which were heavily influenced by female blues and jazz singers like Billie Holiday and Josephine Baker. During the Cockettes' critically panned tour of New York City, Sylvester left them to pursue his career elsewhere. He came to front Sylvester and his Hot Band, a rock act that released two commercially unsuccessful albums on Blue Thumb Records in 1973 before disbanding.|$|E

Fifty-one officers were arrested and subjected to interrogation and torture. Heightened ethnic tensions were the catalyst for the Mauritania–Senegal Border War, which started {{as a result of}} a conflict in Diawara between Moorish Mauritanian herders and Senegalese farmers over grazing rights. On 9 April 1989, Mauritanian guards killed two Senegalese.|$|E

25|$|Senators management, {{seemingly}} {{uneasy about}} racial matters, were latecomers to integrating their team, hiring their first black player {{in late summer}} of 1954.

In October 1957, <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> picketed multiple times in front of Griffith Stadium, protesting the lack <b>of</b> <b>black</b> players on the Redskins. It would be five more years before the Redskins finally began employing black players, the last NFL team to erase the color line.|$|R

25|$|The {{venereal disease}} {{section of the}} U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) formed a study group in 1932 at its {{national}} headquarters. Taliaferro Clark was credited with founding it. His initial goal was to follow untreated syphilis in <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> men for 6 to 9 months, and then follow up with a treatment phase. When he understood the intention of other study members to use deceptive practices, Clark disagreed with the plan to conduct an extended study. He retired {{the year after the}} study began.|$|E
5000|$|Parker and Stone {{had long}} {{wanted to create}} an episode {{exploring}} the racial slur, but struggled with a plot line beyond its opening scene.

[...] "With Apologies to Jesse Jackson" [...] parodies Richards in that Randy, following his use of the word, is forced to apologize to civil rights leader Jesse Jackson.|$|R

25|$|In 1932, Hughes {{became part}} of <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> people {{who went to the}} Soviet Union to make a film {{depicting}} the plight of African Americans in the United States. The film was never made, but Hughes was given the opportunity to travel extensively through the Soviet Union and to the Soviet-controlled regions in Central Asia, the latter parts usually closed to Westerners. While there, he met Robert Robinson, an African American living in Moscow and unable to leave. In Turkmenistan, Hughes met and befriended the Hungarian author Arthur Koestler, then a Communist who was given permission to travel there.|$|E
25|$|McKay became {{involved}} with <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> radicals who were unhappy both with Marcus Garvey's nationalism and the middle-class reformist NAACP.

25|$|St. Augustine was {{the only}} place in Florida where King was arrested; his arrest there {{occurred}} on June 11, 1964, {{on the steps of the}} Monson Motor Lodge's restaurant. The demonstrations came to a climax when <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> and white protesters jumped into the hotel's segregated swimming pool. In response to the protest, James Brock, the manager of the hotel and the president of the Florida Hotel & Motel Association, poured what he claimed to be muriatic acid into the pool to burn the protesters. Photographs of this, and of a policeman jumping into the pool to arrest the protesters, were broadcast around the world.|$|E
25|$|Holliday was {{reported}} to have been involved in a shooting on the Withlacoochee River, Georgia, in 1873. At age 22, Holliday went with some friends to their favorite swimming hole, but discovered it was occupied by <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> youths. Holliday and his companions told them to leave, but they refused. Accounts of this event vary. Holliday left and returned carrying either a shotgun or a pistol and started shooting, either at or {{over the heads of the}} youths. Some of them may have shot back. There are no contemporaneous accounts of the incident. Some family members and friends allege that Holliday killed one to three of the youths, but other members of Holliday's family dispute those accounts.|$|E
25|$|For basic training, Louis was {{assigned}} to a segregated cavalry unit based in Fort Riley, Kansas. The assignment was {{at the suggestion of}} his friend and lawyer Truman Gibson, who knew of Louis's love for horsemanship. Gibson had previously become a civilian advisor to the War Department, in charge of investigating claims of harassment against black soldiers. Accordingly, Louis used this personal connection to help the cause of various black soldiers with whom he came into contact. In one noted episode, Louis contacted Gibson in order to facilitate the Officer Candidate School (OCS) applications of <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> recruits at Fort Riley, which had been inexplicably delayed for several months. Among the OCS applications Louis facilitated was that of a young Jackie Robinson, later to break the baseball color barrier. The episode spawned a personal friendship between the two men.|$|E
