60|$|And by {{prostitution}} I {{mean not}} simply the act {{of a woman who}} sells for money, and against her thoughts and preferences, her smiles and endearments and the secret beauty and pleasure of her body, but the act of anyone who, to gain a living, suppresses himself, does things in a manner alien to himself and subserves aims and purposes with which he disagrees. The journalist who writes against his personal convictions, the solicitor who knowingly assists the schemes of rogues, the barrister who pits himself against what he perceives is justice and the right, the artist who does unbeautiful things or less beautiful things than he might, simply to please base employers, the craftsman who makes instruments for foolish uses or bad uses, the dealer who sells and pushes an article because it fits the customer's folly; all these are prostitutes of mind and soul if not of body, with no right to lift <b>an</b> <b>eyebrow</b> <b>at</b> the painted disasters of the streets.|$|E
6000|$|Shortly {{before the}} time he had fixed for his return he {{received}} from Mrs. Alsager a telegram consisting of the words: [...] "Loder wishes see you--putting Nona instant rehearsal." [...] He spent the few hours before his departure in kissing his mother and sisters, who knew enough about Mrs. Alsager to judge it lucky this respectable married lady was not there--a relief, however, accompanied with speculative glances at London and the morrow. Loder, as our young man was aware, meant the new [...] "Renaissance," [...] but though he reached home in the evening it was not to this convenient modern theatre that Wayworth first proceeded. He spent a late hour with Mrs. Alsager, an hour that throbbed with calculation. She told him that Mr. Loder was charming, he had simply taken up the play in its turn; he had hopes of it, moreover, that {{on the part of a}} professional pessimist might almost be qualified as ecstatic. It had been cast, with a margin for objections, and Violet Grey was to do the heroine. She had been capable, while he was away, of a good piece of work at that foggy old playhouse the [...] "Legitimate;" [...] the piece was a clumsy rechauffe, but she at least had been fresh. Wayworth remembered Violet Grey--hadn't he, for two years, on a fond policy of [...] "looking out," [...] kept dipping into the London theatres to pick up prospective interpreters? He had not picked up many as yet, and this young lady at all events had never wriggled in his net. She was pretty and she was odd, but he had never prefigured her as Nona Vincent, nor indeed found himself attracted by what he already felt sufficiently launched in the profession to speak of as her artistic personality. Mrs. Alsager was different--she declared that she had been struck not a little by some of her tones. The girl was interesting in the thing at the [...] "Legitimate," [...] and Mr. Loder, who had his eye on her, described her as ambitious and intelligent. She wanted awfully to get on--and some of those ladies were so lazy! Wayworth was sceptical--he had seen Miss Violet Grey, who was terribly itinerant, in a dozen theatres but only in one aspect. Nona Vincent had a dozen aspects, but only one theatre; yet with what a feverish curiosity the young man promised himself to watch the actress on the morrow! Talking the matter over with Mrs. Alsager now seemed the very stuff that rehearsal was made of. The near prospect of being acted laid a finger even on the lip of inquiry; he wanted to go on tiptoe till the first night, to make no condition but that they should speak his lines, and he felt that he wouldn't so much as raise <b>an</b> <b>eyebrow</b> <b>at</b> the scene-painter if he should give him an old oak chamber.|$|E

50|$|The Rogues' {{last game}} ever came at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium against the Houston Hurricane. The Rogues won, 6-1. Tony Field scored the final goal in Memphis Rogues history. He beat the goalkeeper {{and walked the}} ball into the net. When he arrived at the goal line, he got down on his knees and headed {{the ball into the}} net. More skeptical fans and that the Rogues were mathematically {{eliminated}} from the playoffs and the Hurricane only need one goal to qualify, raised <b>an</b> <b>eyebrow</b> <b>at</b> the result. In the 1980 NASL goals of the year video, you can clearly see the Hurricanes standing still, allowing Field to give the fans one last show.|$|E
50|$|When {{they arrive}} at the house, Lady Jean (Isabella Rossellini) raises <b>an</b> <b>eyebrow</b> <b>at</b> Linet's disheveled condition. Linet apologizes, but tells her mother how she came close to {{actually}} seeing an elf; and if she doesn't look, then she'll never know for sure. As Lady Jean sends her inside to change, Peter comments to her how Linet is growing up and shows no fear. They then talk about how when her husband, Lord Percival, was in the castle, there was no danger. But since Percival's disappearance, his evil twin brother, Lord Godfrey, has taken over, {{and no one in}} the castle is safe, which is why Jean and Linet live in the country. As Jean stands, she suddenly sees Godfrey approaching, and Peter leaves.|$|E

50|$|The Central Congregational Church of Eastport {{is set on}} {{the west}} side of Middle Street, midway between Boyton and Key Streets. It is a gable-roofed wood frame structure, with {{clapboard}} siding and a stone foundation. Its main facade, facing east is symmetrically organized, with three bays of entrances demarcated by pilasters rising through the gallery level to a cornice, above which is the pedimented gable with <b>an</b> <b>eyebrow</b> window <b>at</b> its center. A square tower is set just back from the front, with a tall first stage that has a clock near the top, with an octagonal belfry as the second stage. The belfry has louvered openings framed by keystoned arches set on impost blocks, with small gables above, surrounding the base of an octagonal steeple.|$|R
50|$|In 1685, Louis married Louise Françoise de Bourbon, {{known at}} court as Mademoiselle de Nantes, {{who was the}} eldest legitimised {{daughter}} of King Louis XIV of France and his mistress, Madame de Montespan. In an age where dynastic considerations played <b>a</b> major role, <b>eyebrows</b> <b>at</b> court were raised at a marriage between a full-blooded prince du sang and a royal bastard.

5000|$|Man lebt nur einmal! ( [...] , You Only Live Once!) is a waltz by Johann Strauss II {{written in}} 1855. The piece was marked as im Ländlerstyle which {{in other words}} means [...] "in the same style as the landler", which is an Austrian folk dance. The title was a {{quotation}} from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's 1774 play Clavigo, but it raised <b>a</b> few <b>eyebrows</b> <b>at</b> that time as Vienna was just recovering from a disastrous cholera epidemic {{and many of the}} stricken populace may have been superstitious of such a title. Nonetheless, Strauss performed it at the Sperl Ballroom to great acclaim and this waltz has endured lasting appeal even in a simple string arrangement for a quintet consisting of two violins, one viola, one cello, and a double bass.|$|R

50|$|The Somerset Academy {{building}} {{is located on}} the north side of Academy Street, a short way east of Brighton Road (Maine State Routes 150/151). The main {{building is}} a 2-1/2 story brick structure, with a front-facing gable roof, and there is a large modern addition to the rear. The front (south-facing) facade is three bays wide, articulated by brick piers, with sash windows on both levels in the outer bays. The center bay is finished in wooden clapboards, and has a simple entrance on the first floor, flanked by widely-set wooden pilasters and topped by an entablature and cornice. The second level has a sash window flanked by pilasters. An entablature encircles the building below the roof line. The front gable is finished in flushboard, with <b>an</b> <b>eyebrow</b> window <b>at</b> its center. Centered on the ridge, a two-stage square tower rises; the first stage is simple, finished in clapboards with cornerboards, while the second belfry stage has louvered round-arch openings and paneled corner pilasters. A simple balustrade tops the tower.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the body}} of Fruitachampsa is known from several partial skeletons and skulls. It is a small crocodyliform under 1 m in length. Although small, Fruitachampsa is large in {{comparison}} to other shartegosuchids, with a maximum skull length of 9 cm. Viewed from above, the skull is square-shaped in the back and narrows toward the snout. The snout is similar in appearance to that of the living caiman genus Paleosuchus, although it is not flattened like in modern crocodylians. As in other early crocodylomorphs, a bone called the palpebral extends backwards over the eye socket like <b>an</b> <b>eyebrow.</b> The teeth <b>at</b> the back of the jaws have flattened tops with ridges running along their length. Unlike other crocodyliforms, Fruitachampsa lacks mandibular or antorbital fenestrae (holes in the lower jaw and in front of the eye sockets). Fruitachampsa differs from other shartegosuchids in that it has procoelous vertebrae with concave anterior surfaces and convex posterior surfaces.|$|R
5|$|Mansfield's {{publicity}} antics {{are another}} recurring theme in popular culture. On the season 32 episode of Saturday Night Live hosted by Alec Baldwin (with musical guest Christina Aguilera), {{one of the}} commercial bumpers has Alec Baldwin PhotoShopped into the famous picture of Sophia Loren staring at Mansfield's chest at Romanoff's in Beverly Hills. It was a direct reference to publicity stunt of Mansfield in April 1957 intended to deflect attention from Loren during a dinner party in the Italian star's honor. Photographs of the encounter were published around the world. The most famous image showed Loren raising <b>a</b> contemptuous <b>eyebrow</b> <b>at</b> the American actress who, sitting between Loren and her dinner companion, Clifton Webb, had leaned over the table, allowing her breasts to spill over her low neckline and exposing one nipple. The photo of Sophia Loren sitting next to Jayne Mansfield and regarding her cleavage inspired other photographers too. In 1993, Daniela Federici created an homage with Anna Nicole Smith as Mansfield and New York City DJ Sky Nellor as Loren for a Guess Jeans campaign. Later, Mark Seliger took a picture named Heidi Klum at Romanoff's with Heidi Klum in a reproduction of the restaurant set. The meeting between Mansfield and Anton LaVey, the founder and high priest of the Church of Satan, was a much publicized and oft quoted event of her life, {{as well as the}} history of the Church.|$|R
50|$|The town's first {{church was}} built near the minister's house in 1787, and was {{destroyed}} by fire in 1821. The town responded by building the brick Federal style meeting house, located southeast of the Foster House across Weathersfield Center Road. This building was built to serve both as a religious sanctuary and to house town meetings. It is a restrained example of late Federal architecture, with round-headed door openings on the ground floor, a Palladian window above the central entrance, and a fully pedimented gable above with <b>an</b> arched <b>eyebrow</b> window <b>at</b> its center. Rising from its roof is a multi-stage tower, starting with a square stage featuring a multilight oculus window, an open octagonal belfry above that, and a louvered cupola at the top. The building's gallery was converted to a full second floor in 1861 to formalize {{the separation of church}} and state, with the sanctuary on one level and town facilities on the other.|$|R
60|$|Once {{the idea}} had got into Lady Harman's head it stayed there very obstinately. She {{surveyed}} the things {{on the table before}} her with <b>a</b> slightly lifted <b>eyebrow.</b> <b>At</b> first she thought the idea of disposing of them an entirely dishonourable idea, and if she couldn't get it out of her head again at least she made it stand in a corner. And while it stood in a corner she began putting a price {{for the first time in}} her life first upon this coruscating object and then that. Then somehow she found herself thinking more and more whether among all these glittering possessions there wasn't something that she might fairly regard as absolutely her own. There were for example her engagement ring and, still more debateable, certain other pre-nuptial trinkets Sir Isaac had given her. Then there were things given her on her successive birthdays. A birthday present of all presents is surely one's very own? But selling is an extreme exercise of ownership. Since those early schooldays when she had carried on an unprofitable traffic in stamps she had never sold anything--unless we are to reckon that for once and for all she had sold herself.|$|R
