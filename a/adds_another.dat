As a goddess of poverty, frustration, and despair, Daniélou associates Dhumavati with Nirriti, the goddess of disease and misery, and Alakshmi, the goddess of misfortune and poverty. Kinsley <b>adds</b> <b>another</b> goddess to the list: Jyestha.|$|E
5|$|A {{proposed}} {{part of the}} regeneration is {{an extension}} of the London Underground to serve the area. Although the site is close to Battersea Park and Queenstown Road stations, it appears to be considered that trains from these stations to Victoria and Waterloo respectively are already heavily loaded. The proposed 2-mile tunnelled extension would branch from the Northern line at Kennington and travel west to Nine Elms and Battersea. The proposed extension would cost at least £500 million in 2008 terms before inflation and optimism bias (extra contingency amounts) and would be part funded by REO and, possibly, other significant land owners in the Nine Elms area. The 2010 planning consent for the site includes a phased contribution of approximately £200 million to the Underground extension, which <b>adds</b> <b>another</b> financial hurdle to the many difficulties in developing the site.|$|E

25|$|Thus, {{the total}} number of {{speakers}} of Berber languages in the Maghreb proper appears to lie anywhere between 16 and 25 million, depending on which estimate is accepted; if we take Basset's estimate, it could be as high as 30 million.

25|$|Later {{literature}} has expanded Arthur's family further. Richard Johnson's 16th-century romance Tom a Lincoln <b>adds</b> <b>another</b> illegitimate son, the eponymous Tom. Through Tom, Arthur is also given grandsons referred to {{only as the}} Black Knight and Faerie Knight. Other works, such as Henry Fielding's Tom Thumb, Walter Scott's The Bridal of Triermain and modern film and television adaptations of Arthurian legend, have occasionally given Arthur daughters, diverging from the earlier legends.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of Oriental carpets, however, {{continue to be}} depicted as objects with visual appeal, without political connotations, but ignoring their original cultural context. It was reserved to a later century to try and reach out for {{a better understanding of}} the carpets within their Islamic cultural context. Whilst Islamic carpets initially served to adorn Renaissance paintings, later on the paintings contributed to {{a better understanding of the}} carpets. Comparative art historical research on Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting thus <b>adds</b> <b>another</b> facette, and leads to a better understanding of the highly multifaceted, and sometimes ambivalent, image of the Ottomans during the Western European Renaissance.|$|E
25|$|As such, {{the play}} is one of Fielding's Scriblerian plays, and the {{commentary}} in the print edition <b>adds</b> <b>another</b> level of satire that originates in the Scriblerus model of Alexander Pope, Jonathan Swift, et al. H. Scriblerus Secundus prefaces the play with claims that Scriblerus spent ten years working on an edition and that the play comes from the Elizabethan time period and {{may or may not}} have been the work of Shakespeare. Additionally, Scriblerus abuses classical sources through mistranslations and misreadings, botches contemporary and traditional critical theory, and is a satirical representation of criticism in general in the tradition of A Tale of a Tub and The Dunciad Variorum. Regardless of the humorous elements, the notes do reveal Fielding's vast classical education.|$|E

25|$|Graphization {{refers to}} development, {{selection}} and modification of scripts and orthographic conventions for a language. The use of {{writing in a}} speech community can have lasting sociocultural effects, which include easier transmission of material through generations, communication with larger numbers of people, and a standard against which varieties of spoken language are often compared. Linguist Charles A. Ferguson made two key observations about the results of adopting a writing system. First, the use of writing <b>adds</b> <b>another</b> variety of the language to the community’s repertory. Although written language is often viewed as secondary to spoken language, the vocabulary, grammatical structures and phonological structures of a language often adopt characteristics in the written form that are distinct from the spoken variety. Second, the use of writing often leads to a folk belief that the written language is the ‘real’ language, and speech is a corruption of it. Written language is viewed as more conservative, while the spoken variety is more susceptible to language change. Isolated relic areas of the spoken language may be less innovative than the written form, or the written language may {{have been based on}} a divergent variety of the spoken language.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{departure}} made by Galactic Civilizations II {{from other}} 4X games is its economic system, {{which is very}} different from the systems used in most strategy games. Typically, 4X strategy games receive money based on a tax rate or based on the income of specific tiles in use by a city or planet. Civilization IV uses this system, and most other 4X strategy games use a variant of it. These incomes are increased by economic structures and sometimes by population, and the profit made off this economic income is used to pay maintenance fees and rush-build units. Galactic Civilizations II <b>adds</b> <b>another</b> layer of complexity by requiring that the income of an empire is used to pay for all forms of production. In order to produce one unit of product, be it research or manufacturing, the player must pay credits (usually in denominations of a Billion Credits, or BC). It is therefore critical that the player balances the economic income of their empire with their industrial output, and not just with the maintenance of their empire. If the player does not have the economy required to support an industrial planet, then they will have to spend at a deficit, and if the player does not correct their economy, they will eventually go broke. This stands in stark contrast to the Civilization series, where industrial output has nothing to do with the player's economic income.|$|E

500|$|CAPEX for {{the plant}} is {{estimated}} to $6.4billion, so financing the plant over a 20-year period <b>adds</b> <b>another</b> $5billion assuming the 6.5% unsecured rate. Considering CAPEX and fuel alone, {{the total cost of}} the plant is 6.4 + 5 + 4 = $15.4billion. Dividing the total cost by the energy produced over the same period gives a rough estimate of the cost of electricity for a 20-year lifetime operation: $15.4billion / 160billion kWh = 9.6 cents/kWh. A 40-year operation lifetime would lead to a cost of electricity of 4.8 cents/kWh. LLNL calculated the LCoE of LIFE.2 at 9.1 cents using the discounted cash flow methodology described in the 2009 MIT report [...] "the Future of Nuclear Energy". Although details on their calculation are lacking, the LIFE.2 LCoE is comparable to conventional sources of power.|$|E
500|$|The second Kanon anime {{series was}} {{reviewed}} at Anime News Network where Theron Martin commented how {{the series is}} a [...] "formulaic moe haremfest", and how the moe aspects of the series may make viewers [...] "feel like they're drowning in a vat of gooey cuteness". The series is described as being similar to the anime television adaptation of Air, saying [...] "Like Air, the first four episodes can be simply summarized as 'male lead arrives in town and kills time interacting with cute girls.' Unlike Air, however, these interactions can occasionally be very funny." [...] Martin also compares Kanon to the anime adaptation of Shuffle! which is described as [...] "bombing" [...] where Kanon [...] "works". The reviewer chalks this up to the characters [...] "endear themselves to the viewer...far better than what Shuffle!s do." [...] Martin cites the transition between humor and serious content as {{a defining feature of}} the series. However, Martin comments how one of the series' flaws is how it [...] "overplays the mundane cutesiness and moe cards at times" [...] causing little to happen with the plot. Yuichi is described as being [...] "too erratic to be fully credible" [...] or easily believable. Despite the series' drawbacks, Martin still describes the series as [...] "one of the best moe-centric series to date" [...] and lauds Kyoto Animation's production values making Kanon [...] "one of the prettiest-looking anime series of the past year". Martin <b>adds</b> <b>another</b> series comparison, citing Kanon as the [...] "polar opposite of Gurren Lagann", which deals primarily in its action-oriented content.|$|E
