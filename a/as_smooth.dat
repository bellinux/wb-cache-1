5|$|Although the {{exterior}} of the Pont du Gard is rough and relatively unfinished, the builders took care to ensure that the interior of the water conduit was <b>as</b> <b>smooth</b> as possible so that the flow of water would not be obstructed. The walls of the conduit were constructed from dressed masonry and the floor from concrete. Both were covered with a stucco incorporating minute shards of pottery and tile. It was painted with olive oil and covered with maltha, a mixture of slaked lime, pork grease and the viscous juice of unripe figs. This produced a surface that was both smooth and durable.|$|E
5|$|If it is {{determined}} {{at the time}} of review that a patient's prognosis may be greater than six months, the patient is de-certified (discharged) from hospice. The hospice is required by law to give advance notification to the patient, and the patient can appeal the hospice's decision to Medicare. Usually the hospice plans these discharges weeks in advance to make the transition off hospice, which can be traumatic for patients who have been preparing to die, <b>as</b> <b>smooth</b> as possible. Should the patient's condition worsen once discharged from hospice they can be readmitted to hospice.|$|E
40|$|The hp-Multigrid <b>as</b> <b>Smoother</b> {{algorithm}} (hp-MGS) for {{the solution}} of higher order accurate space-(time) discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of advection dominated flows is presented. This algorithm combines p-multigrid with h-multigrid at all p-levels, where the h-multigrid acts <b>as</b> <b>smoother</b> in the p-multigrid. The performance of the hp-MGS algorithm is further improved using semi-coarsening in combination with a new semi-implicit Runge-Kutta method <b>as</b> <b>smoother.</b> A detailed multilevel analysis of the hp-MGS algorithm is presented to obtain more insight into the theoretical performance of the algorithm. As model problem a fourth order accurate space-time discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the advection-diffusion equation is considered. The multilevel analysis shows that the hp-MGS algorithm has excellent convergence rates, both for low and high cell Reynolds numbers and on highly stretched meshes...|$|R

5|$|In 1919, {{the company}} ordered seven new trams from Skabo, with {{electric}} equipment from Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB). These {{were the first}} in the country to have Norwegian-built electrical equipment, and also allowed for multiple-unit train control. They were delivered in 1920 and 1921. In addition, six trailers were built from Hannoversche Waggonfabrik (HaWA) The delivery of new rolling stock required a new depot building at Holtet, two new electric arc transformers and a ticket price increase. The HaWa trailers were delivered in 1925. However, the two-axled trailers did not give <b>as</b> <b>smooth</b> a ride, and in 1927 the company ordered bogie trailers from Atelier Métallurgique de Nivelles, which were put into service in 1928 and 1929.|$|E

5|$|The King, {{weakened}} by illness, became progressively less {{active in the}} last years of his reign, devoting an increasing amount of time to prayer, as did his aging mother, who had returned from Poland in 1374. These circumstances allowed Elizabeth to assume a more prominent role at court. Her influence had grown steadily since she had given her husband heirs. It appeared probable that the crowns would pass to one of Elizabeth's underage daughters and by 1374, their rights were confirmed. Behind the scenes, Elizabeth began ensuring that the succession would be <b>as</b> <b>smooth</b> as possible by encouraging a slow but decisive change in the personnel of the government. Warlike and illiterate barons were gradually replaced by a small group of noblemen who excelled in their professional skills but were not distinguished by birth or military ability. Palatine Nicholas I Garai led the movement and enjoyed the full support of the Queen, and their power eventually became virtually unrestricted.|$|E
5|$|Although group 12 {{lies in the}} d-block of {{the modern}} 18-column {{periodic}} table, the d electrons of zinc, cadmium, and (almost always) mercury behave as core electrons and do not take part in bonding. This behavior {{is similar to that}} of the main-group elements, but is in stark contrast to that of the neighboring group 11 elements (copper, silver, and gold), which also have filled d-subshells in their ground-state electron configuration but behave chemically as transition metals. For example, the bonding in chromium(II) sulfide (CrS) involves mainly the 3d electrons; that in iron(II) sulfide (FeS) involves both the 3d and 4s electrons; but that of zinc sulfide (ZnS) involves only the 4s electrons and the 3d electrons behave as core electrons. Indeed, useful comparison can be made between their properties and the first two members of group 2, beryllium and magnesium, and in earlier short-form periodic table layouts, this relationship is illustrated more clearly. For instance, zinc and cadmium are similar to beryllium and magnesium in their atomic radii, ionic radii, electronegativities, and also in the structure of their binary compounds and their ability to form complex ions with many nitrogen and oxygen ligands, such as complex hydrides and amines. However, beryllium and magnesium are small atoms, unlike the heavier alkaline earth metals and like the group 12 elements (which have a greater nuclear charge but the same number of valence electrons), and the periodic trends down group 2 from beryllium to radium (similar to that of the alkali metals) are not <b>as</b> <b>smooth</b> when going down from beryllium to mercury (which is more similar to that of the p-block main groups) due to the d-block and lanthanide contractions. It is also the d-block and lanthanide contractions that give mercury many of its distinctive properties.|$|E
5|$|The Sûreté's {{indirect}} {{penetration of}} military affairs involved linking the military intelligence service (SRM) to the Sûreté {{and the information}} provided by it, thereby making itself dependent on the political information and even political judgement and agenda of the civilian authorities. The central SRM then relayed this information to its local branches {{as part of its}} SRM Bulletin. As a result of the uprising, the SRM became more closely linked to the Sûreté and its methodology and philosophy in of analysing Vietnamese anti-colonial activity. It was further resolved to have all officers involved in studying revolutionary parties. The focus widened from observing only internal army activities to include developments among Vietnamese anti-colonial organisations at large. General Aubert cited complacency and laziness as a factor in the ineffectiveness of the officers in implement French intelligence strategy. He further asserted that the flow of intelligence between French officers and Vietnamese warrant officers was not <b>as</b> <b>smooth</b> as desired. He felt that his men were often not tactful and discreet enough; citing a lack of language skills or interest in talking to their Vietnamese colleagues in an attempt to extricate information. Aubert also believed that the Vietnamese troops were effective in hiding their anti-colonial sentiments from their French colleagues.|$|E
