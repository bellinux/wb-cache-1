5|$|The Lady Chapel {{was built}} by William de Braose, bishop from 1266 to 1287. It was built {{at the rear of}} the church {{constructed}} by Urban and the old choir area was removed in order to build the chapel. From this time on, it seemed as if the cathedral was in <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> repair or alterations at a slow pace. After the Lady Chapel had been completed, the two bays of the north choir aisle were rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|The Frank Slide was a rockslide that buried part of {{the mining}} town of Frank, Northwest Territories, Canada at 4:10 am on April 29, 1903. Over 82 million tonnes (90 million tons) of {{limestone}} rock slid down Turtle Mountain within 100 seconds, obliterating {{the eastern edge of}} Frank, the Canadian Pacific Railway line and the coal mine. It was one of the largest landslides in Canadian history and remains the deadliest, as between 70 and 90 of the town's residents were killed, most of whom remain buried in the rubble. Multiple factors led to the slide: Turtle Mountain's formation left it in <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> instability. Coal mining operations may have weakened the mountain's internal structure, as did a wet winter and cold snap {{on the night of the}} disaster.|$|E
5|$|The terrans are a young {{species with}} psionic potential. The terrans of the Koprulu sector descend from the {{survivors}} of a disastrous 23rd century colonization mission from Earth. Compared to the protoss and zerg, the terrans are technologically inferior, lacking in genetic-diversity, and highly factionalized. The seven dominant government factions are the Moebius Foundation, the Kel-Morian Combine, the Tarsonis Republic, the Mar Sara Republic, the Terran Dominion, the Umojan Protectorate, and the United Earth Directorate. Terrans are in <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> conflict: whenever they are not caught in the two-front pitched battle crossfire with their alien neighbors' interstellar conflicts, they endure frequent assassinations, civil wars and revolutions amongst themselves. Nevertheless, terran ingenuity and unyielding stubbornness has kept them from extinction; they stand {{as one of the}} three dominant species of the galaxy.|$|E

He is {{generally}} quiet, distant, uninterested in people and {{is said to be}} autistic, but has a soft spot for his close friends and the model Shizuka Todou, for whom he has harbored feelings for since childhood.

5|$|The {{threat of}} Apache raids led to <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> unease in San Antonio, and some {{families}} left the area, while others {{refused to leave}} {{the safety of the}} town to tend their livestock. The problems culminated with a late-night raid on San Antonio by 350Apache on June 30, 1745, retaliation for a Spanish military campaign several months before. The attackers were repelled with the assistance of 100Indians from Mission Valero. The Apache also preyed on other tribes, including the Deadose and Tonkawa. In the 1740s, these weaker tribes requested missions along the San Gabriel River in the hopes that the Spanish could protect them from attack. Mission San Francisco Xavier was established at the confluence of the San Gabriel River and Bushy Creek in January 1746 to serve the Deadose, Mayeye, and Coco Indians. In 1748 alone, the Apaches raided the mission four times, killing threesoldiers and four of the Indian residents. Many of the resident Indians fled the mission due to the threat of attacks. This did not deter the missionaries, who founded two more missions, San Ildefonso and Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria, in the area the following year. Within six months, all of the potential converts at San Ildefonso had left. By 1755, the missions were transferred to a new location on the San Marcos River.|$|E

40|$|The {{temperature}} {{at the end}} of reheating and the length of this cosmological phase can be bound to the inflationary observables if one considers the cosmological evolution from the time of Hubble crossing until today. There are many examples in the literature where it is made for single-field inflationary models and <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> equation <b>of</b> <b>state</b> during reheating.

Although the threat of nomadic incursions could never be fully resolved, the Sassanids generally dealt much more successfully with these matters than did the Romans, due to their policy of making coordinated campaigns against threatening nomads.|$|E

50|$|Control {{over the}} Free State was in <b>an</b> almost <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> flux. Following the {{departure}} of D'Annunzio's troops in December 1920, the Italian National Council of Fiume re-assumed control and appointed a provisional government. A pact with the local Italian commander handed control to the military on 18 January 1921, but this lasted just three days before a nationalist rebellion. They appointed an extraordinary government, which fell two days later. In June 1921 an Italian Royal Commissioner was appointed, whose control lasted two weeks.|$|R

The Mi'kmaq and Acadians raided the capital region (Halifax and Dartmouth) 12 times. The worst of these raids was the Dartmouth Massacre (1751). Four of these raids were against Halifax. The first raid was in July 1750: {{in the woods}} on peninsular Halifax, the Mi'kmaq scalped Cornwallis' gardener, his son, and four others. They buried the son, left the gardener's body exposed, and carried off the other four bodies.|$|E

Today in most lower-income societies hierarchies of groups distribute wealth based on personal relationships among group leaders, a process often linked with clientelism and corruption. Michael Mousseau argues that in this kind of socio-economy conflict is always present, latent or overt, because individuals depend on their groups for physical and economic security and are thus loyal to their groups rather than their states, and because groups are in <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> conflict over access to state coffers. Through processes of bounded rationality, people are conditioned towards strong in-group identities and are easily swayed to fear outsiders, psychological predispositions that make possible sectarian violence, genocide, and terrorism.|$|E
