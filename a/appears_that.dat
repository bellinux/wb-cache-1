50|$|In {{light of}} these {{somewhat}} contradictory results, {{it is difficult to}} know for sure what is happening to public opinion on evolution in the US. It does not <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> either side is making unequivocal progress. It does <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> uncertainty about the issue is increasing, however.|$|R
6000|$|... {61} Recently, Lord Lindsay has {{published}} {{another version of}} this story, which makes it <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> he has conversed with a lady who conversed with Hobhouse during his lifetime, in which this story is differently reported. In the last version, it is made to <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> Hobhouse got this declaration from Lady Byron herself.|$|R
5000|$|When hit, enemies {{typically}} {{split into}} smaller versions which {{must also be}} eradicated. Black holes also <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> either attract or repel the spaceship. Many black holes at once may make the game field unnavigable. When a level isn't completed within {{a certain period of}} time, enemies called bugs <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> shoot at the spaceship.|$|R
5|$|According to Anthony S. Cheke and Julian Hume, {{the anatomy}} of the Mascarene grey parakeet {{suggests}} that its habits were largely terrestrial. Like the extinct Mauritian duck and the Mascarene coot, it <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> the Mascarene grey parakeet inhabited both Mauritius and Réunion. Both populations {{were said to be}} easy to hunt by capturing one individual and making it call out, which would summon an entire flock.|$|E
5|$|Although it <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> {{globular}} clusters contain {{some of the}} first stars to be produced in the galaxy, their origins and their role in galactic evolution are still unclear. It does appear clear that {{globular clusters}} are significantly different from dwarf elliptical galaxies and were formed as part of the star formation of the parent galaxy rather than as a separate galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Although it <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> the Council of Chelsea {{approved}} Lichfield's elevation to an archdiocese, Hygeberht, who was present, {{remained a}} bishop at its conclusion; {{he signed the}} council's report still as a bishop. There {{is no indication that}} he played any significant part in the council nor in the actions that led to him becoming an archbishop.|$|E

5|$|As it <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> the {{decision}} of the court of appeals was rested, in addition to other grounds, upon a distinct and independent ground, not involving any federal question, and sufficient in itself to maintain the judgment, the writ of error falls within the wellsettled rule on that subject, and cannot be maintained.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{creation}} of the new archdiocese, Jaenberht retained his position as the senior cleric in the land, with Hygeberht conceding his precedence. When Jaenberht died in 792, he was replaced by Æthelheard, who was consecrated by Hygeberht, now senior in his turn. Subsequently Æthelheard appears as a witness on charters and presides at synods without Hygeberht, so it <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> Offa continued to respect Canterbury's authority.|$|E
5|$|Duncan's reign was not {{successful}} {{and he was}} killed by Macbeth on 15 August 1040. Although Shakespeare's Macbeth presents Malcolm as a grown man and his father as an old one, it <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> Duncan was still young in 1040, and Malcolm and his brother Donalbane were children. Malcolm's family did attempt to overthrow Macbeth in 1045, but Malcolm's grandfather Crínán of Dunkeld was killed in the attempt.|$|E

5|$|Elvish {{greetings}} can {{be expressed}} both by voice and by hand, and often involve {{a combination of the}} two. Elvish greetings are often, but not always, used just prior to a conversation.

5|$|From {{national}} hospital admission databases it <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> {{the need}} for neurosurgical intervention for IIH has increased markedly over the period between 1988 and 2002. This has been attributed {{at least in part}} to the rising prevalence of obesity, although some of this increase may be explained by the increased popularity of shunting over optic nerve sheath fenestration.|$|E
5|$|In 738, Quiriguá, a vassal of Copán, Tikal's key {{ally in the}} south, {{switched}} {{allegiance to}} Calakmul, defeated Copán and gained its own independence. It <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> this was a conscious {{effort on the part}} of Calakmul to bring about the collapse of Tikal's southern allies. This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of Copán.|$|E

50|$|Another {{method is}} to make it <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> the voter has spoiled his or her ballot, thus {{rendering}} it invalid. Typically this would be done by adding another mark to the paper, making it <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> the voter has voted for more candidates than entitled, for instance. It would be difficult to do this to a large number of paper ballots without detection.|$|R
5|$|In addition, it also <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> an applicant's {{subjective}} {{motivation is}} relevant to {{whether he or she}} should be recognized as having public standing. If a case is brought out of ill-will or some other improper purpose, the courts will be reluctant to recognize that the applicant has standing, even if there is a public interest in the case being heard.|$|E
5|$|It <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> Bishop Thomas {{remained}} pro-English and pro-Balliol {{after the}} rising in 1306 of Robert de Brus, Earl of Carrick. Bruce had himself crowned king on 25 March (becoming King Robert I of Scotland). Bishop Thomas' positions mirrored those of William II, Earl of Ross. On 7 December 1307 King Edward II of England was seeking Bishop Thomas' support against King Robert.|$|E
5|$|It <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> Nri had {{an artistic}} {{as well as}} {{religious}} influence on the lower Niger. Sculptures found there are bronze like those at Igbo-Ukwu.

50|$|It <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> Lü {{was not a}} {{particularly}} effective governor of his domain, and there were repeated rebellions against his rule. In response, he instituted strict laws.

5|$|It <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> {{the victory}} of Michael III over the Rus' was invented by the Byzantine historians in the mid-9th century or later and became {{generally}} accepted in the Slavic chronicles influenced by them. However, {{the memory of the}} successful campaign was transmitted orally among the Kievans and may have dictated Nestor's account of Oleg's 907 campaign, which is not recorded in Byzantine sources at all.|$|E
5|$|It is {{unlikely}} that Aubame participated in the planning of the 1964 Gabon coup d'état. It <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> he joined the effort after being recruited by the new government. His nephew, Pierre Eyeguet, a former ambassador to the United Kingdom, may have known of the plot beforehand and notified his uncle, although it is unknown whether or not Aubame established contact with the plotters.|$|E
