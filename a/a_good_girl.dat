500|$|Critics {{have also}} {{commented on the}} song's message. Ariana Bacle of Entertainment Weekly was {{confused}} over Liv's intentions for the song, questioning if the rapper was apologizing to Beyoncé about her flirtation with Jay Z or his alleged, inappropriate behavior with other women. Bacle chose the lyrics, [...] "You got <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>girl,</b> why she messing with a bad guy?" [...] {{as a point of}} confusion, in which the song transitions to become more [...] "directed at Mrs. Carter-Knowles' decisions." [...] In Touch Weeklys Carly Sitzer viewed the track as [...] "ultra-confusing", and cast doubt on Liv's claims of being a victim and the object of Beyoncé's jealousy. Echoing this thought, Bustles Kaitlin Reilly was critical of Liv's interpretation of herself as a victim in the song's lyrics.|$|E

500|$|Babb cheaply {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} what would become [...] "She Shoulda Said No!" [...] shortly after Robert Mitchum and Lila Leeds were arrested for marijuana use. Its original producer had struggled to get it distributed as Wild Weed, and Babb quickly presented it as The Story of Lila Leeds and Her Exposé of the Marijuana Racket, hoping that the title would draw audiences. When it failed to stir up much interest, Babb instead focused on the one scene of female nudity, using a photo of Leeds in a showgirl outfit, and retitled it [...] "She Shoulda Said 'No'!", with taglines such as [...] "How Bad Can <b>a</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Girl</b> Get [...] [...] [...] without losing her virtue or respect???" [...] According to Friedman, Babb's midnight presentation of the film twice a week made more money than any other film at the same theater would earn over a full run; Friedman proceeded to use the film in his own roadshow double features.|$|E
500|$|To {{promote the}} album's release, Madonna {{talked about the}} album in an audio message {{available}} exclusively online prior to its release. There were promotional advertisements aired on television channels proclaiming {{that there will be}} [...] "no sexual references on the album" [...] and Madonna adding that [...] "it's a whole new me! I'm going to be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>girl,</b> I swear." [...] One of the first promotional appearances the singer did was in Paris, where she was interviewed by Ruby Wax and talked about the album. According to Wax, she was quite intimidated by Madonna and her entourage and, in her own words, [...] " [...] nerves got the best of me". On February 18, 1995, Madonna arrived in Europe to promote Bedtime Stories. During the same day, she performed [...] "Secret" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] on German TV show Wetten, dass..?, while she was also interviewed on the program.|$|E
500|$|The video {{received}} mostly {{positive response}} from the journalist and critics. Jamie Portman from The Daily Gazette felt that the clip could be [...] "vulnerable to charges of being blatantly provocative in its calculated blending of sex and religion". David Rosenthal from The Spokesman-Review found the video as [...] "visually stunning"; however, Edna Gundersen from USA Today {{did not understand the}} media mayhem behind the clip. She pointed out that [...] "Madonna is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>girl</b> in the video. She saves someone. What is the big deal?..." [...] Among music critics, Phil Kloer from Record-Journal felt that whether one condemns the video as racist or not, [...] "It's condemnable {{on the face of it}} because it exploits a symbol of evil [...] in order to sell records." [...] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Chris Willman complimented the video for its portrayal of a love song, rather than blasphemy. He was more interested in the stigmata presented in the clip. Taraborrelli described his thoughts: [...] "Madonna danced with such abundance in , as if she knew that she was about to cause a commotion, and couldn't wait to see how it would unfold." ...|$|E

500|$|Via Franklin Productions, Kay filmed the {{production}} in six days, {{a common occurrence}} given that most films of the era were shot with a quick turnaround. [...] Eureka Productions initially distributed the film, but it struggled to find an audience until Kroger Babb's Hallmark Productions acquired the rights for distribution. Babb initially marketed the film under the title The Story of Lila Leeds and Her Exposé of the Marijuana Racket, but failed to achieve success with that title and eventually changed it to [...] "She Shoulda Said 'No'!". [...] He pushed the sensuality of Leeds with new promotional photographs and a new tagline: [...] "How Bad Can <b>a</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Girl</b> Get... without losing her virtue or respect???", while sending letters to local communities falsely claiming that the United States Treasury Department implored Hallmark to release the film [...] "in as many towns and cities {{as possible in the}} shortest possible length of time" [...] as a public service. The square-up misleadingly stated that the producers wished to [...] "publicly acknowledge the splendid cooperation of the Nation's narcotic experts and Government departments, who aided in various ways the success of this production…. If its presentation saves but one young girl or boy from becoming a 'dope fiend' – then its story has been well told." ...|$|E
500|$|The character, of Turkish descent, is {{described}} as being [...] "torn between two worlds", which Hussen explained are her traditional family life and modern London life. Naz is a family girl who has reached a point in her life where she wants to have fun, but is also a daddy's girl, the apple of her father's eye. He sees her as a perfect student. She has {{a good relationship with}} her parents and is respectful of them, doing what they want, even though they do not know her very well. She loves her family but they do not understand her or what she wants. Hussen opined that Naz would be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>girl</b> if her family did understand her more. What Naz wants is to be like everyone around her {{and to be able to}} pick her own boyfriend, but being from a Muslim family means she is unable to. She tries to keep each side of her life secret from the other, but more of each side is seen as the series goes on, and they eventually meet, leading to bad consequences. Hussen opined that this is a common real-life situation that is rarely portrayed on television, so girls would be able relate to the character. Naz likes to make everyone happy but ultimately is more likely to think about her own happiness; she likes to get her own way.|$|E
500|$|James Reed of The Boston Globe {{described}} [...] "Radio" [...] as fun, bouncy, {{and ideal}} {{for a night}} at the club. Similarly, Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the [...] "spiky, Europop throb" [...] of [...] "Radio" [...] expertly taunt the boys and fill the dance floor. Darryl Sterdan of Jam! was surprised by the new musical direction of Beyoncé but concluded that [...] "... you better believe it ... it kinda works". Daniel Brockman of The Phoenix described [...] "Radio" [...] as the most believable song on the album, and complimented its [...] "amid bland testaments to love's timeless endurance and the smut and thuggin of the 'Sasha Fierce' persona, [...] is one with sensual overtones sung to an electronic device that, unlike men, 'never lets me down'". Echoing Brockman's sentiments, Amy Linden of Vibe magazine, who wrote that 1980's electropop and the sleek Valentine music of [...] "Radio" [...] tells the story of Beyoncé's alter ego. Similarly, Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond of The Village Voice wrote that [...] "Radio" [...] "show [...] Sasha [...] just <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>girl</b> playing fierce". By contrast, Matos Michaelangelo of The A.V. Club said that [...] "Radio" [...] sounds like [...] "shameless target-marketing" [...] aiming at programming directors. On The Village Voice 2008 year-end Pazz & Jop singles list, [...] "Radio" [...] was ranked at number 443.|$|E

500|$|A {{published}} synopsis in The Nickelodeon {{reads as}} follows, [...] "The night before Christmas, Alice, {{a child of}} wealth, after going through the usual form of hanging up her stocking, is put to bed by her maid. Alice falls asleep and dreams. Enter Santa Claus and Gnomes who tell Alice to follow her and they will show her part of their Funnyland. Alice follows the little people under the special protection of a policeman two foot high. The little party are seen trotting through beautiful glens and dales until they reach Funnyland. Santa Claus tells {{her that if she}} is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>girl</b> all the animals and toys here are hers; as Alice touches each one they come to life. The teddy bear steps out to dance with Alice. As Alice removes the cover from Doll's box the doll dances out, a little king gives a magical entertainment, a clown is very active and all the animals and dolls do some interesting act much to the surprise and delight of little Alice. At last, tired out, Alice falls asleep reclining upon the shoulders of Teddy bear. Then we see her again back in her own little bed. It is now Christmas morning. Her maid awakens and dresses her for the great event, takes her to the drawing room where she is welcomed by her parents to find that her dream has come true." [...] Originally the film was billed as being released for December 19, 1910 and then it was later claimed to be December 26, 1910. This release was attributed in an issue of The Nickelodeon. However, the film was not released on December 19 because an advertisement in Moving Picture World in January 1911 said that the release would be delayed for a [...] "few days". It is unknown, and unlikely, if the film actually was released because no other publications, ads or materials surrounding the Gnome Motion Picture Company followed.|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} {{is described as}} having [...] "always been <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>girl,</b> but when her parents head back to Nigeria she feels abandoned." [...] Mojekwu described the character as [...] "very strong-willed and bound within her faith. Her best attribute is that she's very motherly and takes people under her wing to look after them. Her worst is that she takes the world on her shoulders and {{you just want to}} tell her, 'You don't have to worry about , you can't deal with it alone'. Mercy takes too much on." [...] The character often wears a yellow jacket and has a red hair weave, which Mojekwu said, [...] "didn't look too great".|$|E

Yes, she is a cheerleader, but she also goes home and listens to punk music. She's into really dark art and probably rips the heads off of Barbie dolls. Basically, she's a train wreck." [...] Burton said the character may be [...] "a train wreck" [...] but that she was [...] "so glad [...] putting a girl like her on TV. You don't have to be one thing. Peyton has made that OK".|$|E
2500|$|Juri's {{personality}} {{was proposed}} by Ono to {{be a strong}} character, and while laughing compared it to that of a protester. She was originally designed to be a nice person who happens to be consorting with bad characters, but Ono went against this, stating [...] "she can't be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>girl.</b> Surprise everyone and make her a really evil chick." [...] Her quotes were designed {{to have a lot of}} double entendres, with writer Kawasaki, citing one quote that while it appears as a compliment of their physique, her opponent may take offense to it. Initially, she was designed to be always smiling, similar to other female characters according to developer Kamei. However, it did not fit, resulting in the team working on other faces, some he describes as [...] "scary." [...] The team eventually settled on a [...] "cool-headed" [...] look. Kamei commented that one of his favourite expressions of Juri's is the one she makes when she appears to be having fun; he adds that this look made him feel like the animators had finally began to understand the character. In designing her eyes, Kamei wanted her eyes to have more expression to them than other characters, commenting that the team [...] "wanted her to tell a story with her eyes." [...] Because of the anger from Korean fans over the lack of a Korean character in Street Fighter, the team decided to make her a strong character. Juri is said to have a warlike and provocative character and enjoys playing around with her opponent while beating them. She has also been described in a similar fashion, including [...] "sex-crazed" [...] and [...] "sultry." [...] Developer Tamamura describes her as a [...] "pleasure-seeker" [...] and a [...] "character who would enjoy fighting." ...|$|E
