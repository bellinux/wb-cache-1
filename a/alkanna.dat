50|$|Mount Tabor {{was entirely}} covered with {{vegetation}} typical of northern Ancient Israel until {{the reign of}} the Ottoman Empire, during which period most of the trees were felled. The trees were felled for use in the charcoal industry. As part of the Jewish National Fund's efforts to recreate the landscapes of the country, the area was reforested with trees which are similar to its original vegetation during the 1960s and 1970s. Today, most of Mount Tabor is covered with trees, Mount Tabor Oak (Quercus ithaburensis) and Palestine oak (Quercus calliprinos). Up to 400 plant species have been found on the Mount, including large yellow crocuses (Sternbergia clusiana), the Persian lily (Fritillaria persica) rain-bells flowers (Muscari parviflorum), while tulips (Tulipa agenensis), orchids, irises (including Iris haynei) and yellow asphodel (Asphodeline Lutea), spontaneous barley (Hordeum spontaneum), Mt.

40|$|Background: Medicinal {{plants are}} {{recognized}} as sources of natural antioxidants that can protect biological system from oxidative stress. Objective: In this study, the antioxidant activities of four species of the <b>Alkanna</b> genus (<b>Alkanna</b> bracteosa, <b>Alkanna</b> frigida, <b>Alkanna</b> orientalis and <b>Alkanna</b> tricophila) were evaluated. Materials and Methods: The dried roots of plant samples (100 g) were extracted separately by percolation method with MeOH/H 2 O (80 / 20) and four fractions were provided respectively with hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, butanol and water. Antioxidant activities were investigated by using 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl, ferric thiocyanate and thiobarbituric acid methods and compared with quercetin (as positive control). Results: The {{results indicated that the}} butanol fractions of four species had the highest antioxidant activity and radical scavenging activity compared with the other fractions studied (P 0. 05) between the total antioxidant activities of same fractions. The total antioxidant activity values of <b>Alkanna</b> fractions in a descending order are as follows: Butanol fraction > ethyl acetate fraction > total extract > hexane fraction > chloroform fraction > aqueous fraction.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the effect of grazing intensity on dynamics of <b>Alkanna</b> populations that grow in Saint Catherine mountains. Seventy plots (4 x 4 m 2) were selected to represent variation of <b>Alkanna</b> orientalis population under different degrees of grazing and human disturbances. The results showed that four main groups of <b>Alkanna</b> population can be recognized. These groups differ significantly {{in the percentage of}} coverage, average of flower buds, flowers, fruits, plant height and grazing intensity and soil organic content. Insignificant variation in the soil moisture content, natality, and mortality were indicated. The impact of grazing and fencing was seen through the comparison between fenced and unfenced populations. The results revealed that the vegetation cover, average of plant height and reproductive organs (floral buds) increased for unfenced population as compared to fenced while percentage of dryness and average number of fruits was higher in fenced population. The results of natality and mortality showed that the four groups of <b>Alkanna</b> populations have different rates of natality occurring at third and fourth groups of populations (heavily grazed), whereas the mortality rate of first group was very high as compared to a very low rate in the fourth grou...|$|E
40|$|Seeds of <b>Alkanna</b> {{were tested}} to {{determine}} the germination behavior and dormancy (if present). Four treatments of temperature (5, 10, 15 & 20), soaking in boiled water (till cooling), chilling (2 - 5 oC for one week) and mechanical scarification by sandpaper (for 5 min) were used to investigate the best germination percent. A set of alternations of temperature and light was applied. The results revealed that greatest germination percent occurred at combination of temperature and light with two degrees of temperature, 5 oC with light off and 20 oC with light on whereas the lowest germination percent occurred at constant low temperature (5 oC). The ordination diagrams revealed that <b>Alkanna</b> orientalis occupies a great position between arrows of soil conditions and landform types which indicates that <b>Alkanna</b> affected by soil texture (fine sand fraction), moisture content and organic matter of the soil and boulders.

40|$|Alkannin is {{an active}} {{constituent}} from the root extract of <b>Alkanna</b> tinctoria of the Boraginaceae family {{and it may have}} utility as a heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) inducer in living organisms. Here, the effects of alkannin-induced HSP 70 on ultraviolet (UV) B (40 mJ/cm 2) -induced apoptosis were investigated in human keratinocyte HaCaT cells. Pretreatment of cells with alkannin (1 mM) caused significant inhibition of UVB-induced apoptosis and caspase- 3 cleavage. On the other hand, the addition of KNK 437 (HSP 70 inhibitor) reversed the action of alkannin increasing UVB-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, differences in gene expression associated with the suppression of UVB-induced apoptosis in the presence of alkannin were investigated using Gene Chip assay. Our results indicate that alkannin suppresses UVB-induced apoptosis through the induction of HSP 70 in human keratinocytes, and therefore, we suggest the usefulness of using alkannin as an antiaging agent...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-one chitinolytic actinomycete-isolates were {{isolated}} on chitin agar {{and were able}} to degrade chitin as sole carbon source. Total count of chitinolytic active actinomycetes (halo-forming colonies) were significantly lower (P< 0. 05) than those non-active colonies (non -halo-forming colonies). Rizosphere of <b>Alkanna</b> orientalis plants grown in Saint Catherine area was better habitat for chitinolytic actinomycetes than other rhizospheres of tested plants grown in Suez Canal farm. Using RAPD analysis in an attempt to generate specific markers for chitinolylic actinomycete-isolates, we able to analyzed seven randomly polymorphic DNA primers against the most active chitinolytic actinomycete-isolates. Most of the primers used were useful in identifying unique DNA polymorphisms of all isolates tested. Thirty RAPD-PCR markers were found to be effective to be used as isolate-specific markers. Phylogenetic relationships between the isolates using previous technique (RAPD analysis) revealed that the isolates with higher similarity percent were belong to the same taxonomical group.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Current chemotherapies of {{cutaneous}} leihmaniasis {{have faced}} to some problems and limitations; {{development of new}} anti-leishmanicidal drugs from different sources like herbal plants, are crucially important. The objective {{of the present study}} was evaluation of in vitro activity of <b>Alkanna</b> frigida extracts in comparison with glucantime against Leishmania major. Materials and Methods: L. major promastigotes were exposed to different concentrations of the A. frigida extracts, processed by ethyl acetate, ethanol, hexane and chloroform. The inhibitory effect, as the IC 50, were calculated after 24, 48 and 72 hours by linear regression analysis values of the concentrations employed. Results: The significant inhibition was observed after 24 and 48 hours with different concentrations of compounds (p< 0. 05 in all tests). All extracts had potent activity against proliferation of the promastigotes, comparing to the untreated negative control. It could compete with the glucantime efficacy in some concentrations. Ethyl acetate and ethanol extractions showed potent IC 50 value, 106 µg/ml and 86 µg/ml, respectively. Hexane and chloroform extractions had poor efficacy after 24 hours; however, the efficacy increased after 48 and 72 hours. Conclusion: The results indicated that the A. frigida has appropriate inhibitory effects on the growth of L. major promastigotes in vitro and can be of herbal targets for further investigation in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Various plant seeds have {{received}} little attention in fatty acid research. Seeds from 30 species mainly of Boraginaceae and Primulaceae were analysed {{in order to}} identify potential new sources of the n- 3 PUFA α-linolenic acid (ALA) and stearidonic acid (SDA) and of the n- 6 PUFA γ-linolenic acid (GLA). The fatty acid distribution differed enormously between genera of the same family. Echium species (Boraginaceae) contained the highest amount of total n- 3 PUFA (47. 1 %), predominantly ALA (36. 6 %) and SDA (10. 5 %) combined with high GLA (10. 2 %). Further species of Boraginaceae rich in both SDA and GLA were Omphalodes linifolia (8. 4, 17. 2 %, resp.), Cerinthe minor (7. 5, 9. 9 %, resp.) and Buglossoides purpureocaerulea (6. 1, 16. 6 %, resp.). <b>Alkanna</b> species belonging to Boraginaceae had comparable amounts of ALA (37. 3 %) and GLA (11. 4 %) like Echium but lower SDA contents (3. 7 %). Different genera of Primulaceae (Dodecatheon and Primula) had varying ALA (14. 8, 28. 8 %, resp.) and GLA portions (4. 1, 1. 5 %, resp.), but similar amounts of SDA (4. 9, 4. 5 %, resp.). Cannabis sativa cultivars (Cannabaceae) were rich in linoleic acid (57. 1 %), but poor in SDA and GLA (0. 8, 2. 7 %, resp.). In conclusion, several of the presented plant seeds contain considerable amounts of n- 3 PUFA and GLA, which could be relevant for nutritional purposes due to their biological function as precursors for eicosanoid synthesis...|$|E
