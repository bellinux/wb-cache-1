5|$|Later in his career, Vonnegut {{published}} several autobiographical {{essays and}} short-story collections, including Fates Worse Than Death (1991), and <b>A</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Without</b> a Country (2005). After his death, he {{was hailed as}} a morbidly comical commentator on the society in which he lived, and {{as one of the}} most important contemporary writers. Vonnegut's son Mark published a compilation of his father's unpublished compositions, titled Armageddon in Retrospect. Numerous scholarly works have examined Vonnegut's writing and humor.|$|E

25|$|Slager {{was named}} {{in a police}} {{complaint}} in 2013 for allegedly using a Taser on <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>without</b> cause. Slager was cleared by the police department over the incident; the victim and several witnesses {{said they were not}} interviewed. Following the Scott killing, North Charleston police stated they would re-review the 2013 complaint. Slager was named in a second tasing-without-cause complaint following an August 2014 police stop. A complaint filed in January 2015 resulted in Slager being cited for failing to file a report.|$|E
25|$|The Second National Congress {{was held}} from September 30 until October 12, 1813. It was {{attended}} by 1100 delegates, chosen by universal male suffrage and presided by Pedro Juan Caballero. Congress rejected a proposal for Paraguayan participation at a constitutional congress at Buenos Aires and approved the new Constitution on October 12, 1813 when Paraguayan Republic was officially proclaimed (the first in South America). It also created a two-man executive body with two consuls – Fulgencio Yegros and Francia. Yegros, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>without</b> political ambitions, represented the nationalist criollo military elite, while Francia was more powerful of the two because he derived his strength from the nationalist masses.|$|E

25|$|The {{position}} of women under Welsh law differed significantly {{to that of}} their Norman-English contemporaries. A marriage could be established in two basic ways. The normal way was that the woman would be given to a man by her kindred; the abnormal way was that the woman could elope with <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>without</b> the consent of her kindred. In this case her kindred could compel her to return if {{she was still a}} virgin, but if she was not she could not be compelled to return. If the relationship lasted for seven years she had the same entitlements {{as if she had been}} given by her kin.|$|E
25|$|During September and October 1954 a {{chain of}} events culminated in a {{confrontation}} between the governor general and the prime minister. Prime Minister Bogra tried to limit the powers of Governor General Ghulam Mohammad through hastily adopted amendments to the de facto constitution, the Government of India Act of 1935. The governor general, however, enlisted the tacit support of the army and civil service, dissolved the Constituent Assembly, and then formed a new cabinet. Bogra, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>without</b> a personal following, remained prime minister but without effective power. General Iskander Mirza, who had been a soldier and civil servant, became minister of the interior; General Muhammad Ayub Khan, the army commander, became minister of defence; and Chaudhry Muhammad Ali, former head of the civil service, remained minister of finance. The main objective of the new government was to end disruptive provincial politics and to provide the country with a new constitution. The Federal Court, however, declared that a new Constituent Assembly must be called. Ghulam Mohammad was unable to circumvent the order, and the new Constituent Assembly, elected by the provincial assemblies, {{met for the first time}} in July 1955. Bogra, who had little support in the new assembly, fell in August and was replaced by Choudhry; Ghulam Mohammad, plagued by poor health, was succeeded as governor general in September 1955 by Mirza.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, NPR wrote, [...] "Kurt Vonnegut's {{blend of}} anti-war {{sentiment}} and satire {{made him one}} of the most popular writers of the 1960s." [...] Vonnegut stated in a 1987 interview that, [...] "my own feeling is that civilization ended in World War I, and we're still trying to recover from that", and that he wanted to write war-focused works without glamorizing war itself. Vonnegut had not intended to publish again, but his anger against the George W. Bush administration led him to write <b>A</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Without</b> a Country.|$|E

500|$|The {{performance}} of Shraddha by a son during Pitru Paksha {{is regarded as}} compulsory by Hindus, {{to ensure that the}} soul of the ancestor goes to heaven. In this context, the scripture Garuda Purana says, [...] "there is no salvation for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>without</b> a son". The scriptures preach that a householder should propitiate ancestors (Pitris), along with the gods (devas), ghosts (bhutas) and guests. The scripture Markandeya Purana says that if the ancestors are content with the shraddhas, they will bestow health, wealth, knowledge and longevity, and ultimately heaven and salvation (moksha) upon the performer.|$|E
500|$|From Hamburg, Lafayette sent a note {{of thanks}} to General Bonaparte. The French government, the Directorate, was unwilling to have Lafayette return unless he swore allegiance, which he {{was not willing to}} do, as he {{believed}} it had come to power by unconstitutional means. [...] As revenge, it had his remaining properties sold, leaving him a pauper. The family, soon joined by Georges Washington, who had returned from America, recuperated on a property near Hamburg belonging to Adrienne's aunt. [...] Due to conflict between the United States and France, Lafayette could not go to America as he had hoped, making him <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>without</b> a country.|$|E
500|$|On Tahiti Heywood and {{his companions}} set about organising their lives. The largest group, led by James Morrison, began {{building}} a schooner, to be named Resolution after Cook's ship. Matthew Thompson and former master-at-arms Charles Churchill chose to lead drunken and generally dissolute lives which ended in the violent deaths of both. Heywood preferred quiet domesticity in a small house with a Tahitian wife, studying the Tahitian language and fathering a daughter. Over a period of 18months he gradually adopted native manners of dress, and was heavily tattooed around the body. Heywood later explained: [...] "I was tattooed not to gratify my own desires, but theirs", adding that in Tahiti <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>without</b> tattoos was an outcast. [...] "I always made it a maxim when I was in Rome to act as Rome did." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1979, Vonnegut married Jill Krementz, a {{photographer}} {{whom he met}} while {{she was working on}} a series about writers in the early 1970s. [...] With Jill, he adopted a daughter, Lily, when the baby was three days old. In subsequent years, his popularity resurged as he published several satirical books, including Jailbird (1979), Deadeye Dick (1982), Galápagos (1985), Bluebeard (1987), and Hocus Pocus (1990). In 1986, Vonnegut was seen by a younger generation when he played himself in Rodney Dangerfield's film Back to School. The last of Vonnegut's fourteen novels, Timequake (1997), was, as University of Detroit history professor and Vonnegut biographer Gregory Sumner said, [...] "a reflection of an aging man facing mortality and testimony to an embattled faith in the resilience of human awareness and agency." [...] Vonnegut's final book, a collection of essays entitled <b>A</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Without</b> a Country (2005), became a bestseller.|$|E
500|$|Darah dan Doa was {{directed}} by Usmar Ismail, a former soldier who had previously served as assistant director on Andjar Asmara's Gadis Desa (Village Maiden) and directed two films on his own, Tjitra (Image) and Harta Karun (Treasure; all 1949). Creative control for these works, {{all of which were}} produced for the Dutch-sponsored South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC), was held by cameraman A.A. Denninghoff-Stelling; Ismail served more as a dialogue coach. When the Netherlands recognised Indonesia's independence following several months of conferences in 1949, Ismail and other SPFC staff discussed establishing their own studio, though steps were not taken to do so until the following year. For his first production, Ismail chose to adapt a short story by the poet Sitor Situmorang, which the latter man had brought to him; Ismail later wrote that he considered it interesting because it [...] "honestly told the story of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>without</b> descending into cheap propaganda".|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} season {{saw the two}} drivers collide again. With Senna leading Prost, now in a Ferrari, in {{the world}} Drivers' Championship, Prost qualified second for the penultimate race {{of the season in}} Suzuka with Senna on pole. Between the end of qualifying and race day, pole position was switched {{to the other side of}} the track without explanation. Senna complained that no longer being on the racing line, his side of the grid was dirty, meaning he would get less grip and therefore a slower start compared to Prost who had been moved to the clean side of the grid. The Brazilian's appeal was rejected. At the start of the race, Prost got the better start of the two; but whilst braking for the first corner, Senna refused to back off and collided with Prost at , clinching the title for the Brazilian. Prost almost retired from the sport, saying [...] "What he did was disgusting. He is <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>without</b> value." [...] A year later, Senna admitted that the move was premeditated, in retaliation for the collision at the chicane on the same course the previous year.|$|E

500|$|Historian Hugh Ross {{argued that}} in gaining the nomination, Willkie [...] "gave {{exceptional}} promise of being a winner. There were ample precedents from American political history in which a minority party, queasy over prospects for survival, bypassed professional leadership in order to entrust its political fortunes to <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>without</b> political experience. [...] In most of the previous instances, the nomination {{had gone to a}} military man. In 1940, it went to a businessman." [...] Richard Moe, in his book on the 1940 election, suggested that the nomination of Willkie left long-lasting scars on the Republican Party, with conservatives angered by the success of its Eastern Establishment wing; [...] "whatever else it did, Philadelphia gave birth to the bitter proprietary division within the Republican Party, one accentuated by ideology and geography, that would define the party for decades to come." [...] Among those converted from isolationism by Willkie's oratory, and who worked intensely on the Willkie campaign in Michigan, was Gerald R. Ford, who wrote many years later in his memoirs, [...] "I now realize that my participation did not make much difference at all to the political fate of Wendell Willkie. But it made a lot of difference to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Scholar Virginia Sapiro {{states that}} few read Wollstonecraft's works {{during the nineteenth}} century as [...] "her attackers implied or stated that no self-respecting woman would read her work". (In fact, as Craciun points out, new editions of Rights of Woman {{appeared}} in the UK in the 1840s, and in the US in the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s.) One of those few was Elizabeth Barrett Browning, who read Rights of Woman at the age of 12, and whose poem Aurora Leigh reflected [...] "Wollstonecraft's unwavering focus on education". Lucretia Mott, a Quaker minister, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Americans who met at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, discovered they had both read Wollstonecraft, and agreed the need for what became the Seneca Falls Convention, an influential women's rights meeting held in 1848. Another who read Wollstonecraft was George Eliot, a prolific writer of reviews, articles, novels, and translations. In 1855, she devoted an essay to the roles and rights of women, comparing Wollstonecraft and Margaret Fuller. Fuller was an American journalist, critic, and women's rights activist who, like Wollstonecraft, had travelled to the Continent, been involved in the struggle for reform (in this case the Roman Republic), and had a child by <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>without</b> marrying him. Wollstonecraft's children's work was adapted by Charlotte Mary Yonge in 1870.|$|E
500|$|De la Rúa {{started to}} work in {{politics}} from a very young age. He was nicknamed [...] "Chupete" [...] (...) because of this; the nickname was still used when he grew up. During Carlos Menem's administration he was perceived as a serious and formal politician, in stark contrast with Menem's style. De la Rúa took advantage of this perception during the electoral campaign of 1999. When he became president and the economic crisis worsened, he was perceived as a weak and tired man who was unable {{to react to the}} crisis. He was perceived as <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>without</b> leadership who could not make use of his presidential authority. De la Rúa considers that the parody of the television comedian Freddy Villarreal helped to establish that image. He sought to change his image by appearing on the television comedy show El show de Videomatch, but it backfired. He confused the names of the show and that of the host Marcelo Tinelli's wife. After De la Rúa's participation ended, Tinelli began to close the program; De la Rúa could be seen seeking an exit from the set in the background. The popular image was further strengthened when he was hospitalized for peripheral artery disease caused by high blood cholesterol. Although it is a standard, simple medical intervention, the medic told the press De la Rúa suffered from arteriosclerosis, which is usually linked with a lack of speed and reflexes.|$|E
