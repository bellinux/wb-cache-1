As they neared land Braham and Walsh noticed a slight whine in the aircraft's radio speakers meaning the Mosquito was being tracked by radar.|$|E
5|$|After nearly 50,000cars were flooded and ruined, {{many people}} {{attempted}} {{to sell the}} cars across the country without telling of the car's history. Following the extreme flooding, <b>a</b> <b>mosquito</b> outbreak occurred, though FEMA provided aid to control the problem. Health officials also recommended disinfecting private wells with bleach, due to possible contamination from the severe flooding.

5|$|American crows succumb {{easily to}} West Nile virus infection. This was {{originally}} a mosquito-borne African virus causing encephalitis in humans and livestock since about 1000 AD, and was accidentally introduced to North America in 1999, apparently by an infected air traveller who got bitten by <b>a</b> <b>mosquito</b> after arrival. It {{is estimated that}} the American crow population has dropped by up to 45% since 1999. Despite this decline, the crow is considered a species of least concern.|$|E
5|$|Britain's Sir Ronald Ross, an army surgeon {{working in}} Secunderabad India, proved in 1897 that malaria is {{transmitted}} by mosquitoes, an event now commemorated via World Mosquito Day. He {{was able to}} find pigmented malaria parasites in <b>a</b> <b>mosquito</b> that he artificially fed on a malaria patient who had crescents in his blood. He continued his research into malaria by showing that certain mosquito species (Culex fatigans) transmit malaria to sparrows and he isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds. He reported this to the British Medical Association in Edinburgh in 1898.|$|E

5|$|On 27 September 1946 Geoffrey de Havilland Jr {{was killed}} test-flying the DH.108 Swallow over the Thames estuary. Cunningham {{had taken off}} {{at the same time}} to deliver the first Vampire in Switzerland. Cunningham only learned the next morning, from Swiss {{newspapers}} at breakfast in Geneva, that de Havilland was missing. Cunningham knew the family well and contacted his father, whose other son John had been killed in a collision while flying <b>a</b> <b>Mosquito</b> in 1943. With the agreement of de Havilland senior, Cunningham took the dead pilot's post which earned him £2,000 per year.|$|E
5|$|Over France, {{the losses}} became quite severe, {{particularly}} over {{the port of}} Brest, France. German defences were strong, owing to Operation Cerberus and Operation Donnerkeil, a joint Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe plan to enable the escape of Gneisenau, Scharnhorst and Prinz Eugen through the English Channel. Five Spitfires and <b>a</b> <b>Mosquito</b> were lost on PR operations in December 1941. The failure to photograph and pin-point {{the location of the}} ships, led to their successful move to Germany in February 1942. It was not until the day of the German operation that a Coastal Command aircraft caught sight of the ships, and by then it was too late.|$|E
5|$|The first updated Mk. V sets {{arrived in}} April 1942 and were fitted to the de Havilland Mosquito as they became available. A Mk. V {{equipped}} Mosquito claimed its first kill on 24/25 June, when <b>a</b> <b>Mosquito</b> NF.II from No. 151 Squadron shot down a Dornier Do 217E-4 over the North Sea. In practice {{it was found}} that pilots had considerable difficulty looking up from the display at the last minute, and the system was used only experimentally. By this time the microwave units had started to arrive in small numbers, so Mk. V production was repeatedly delayed pending their arrival, and eventually cancelled.|$|E

5|$|The name Anita was retired {{following}} this storm, {{and will never}} be used for an Atlantic hurricane again. Shortly after the hurricane made landfall, the government of Mexico sent two trucks of food to the areas of greatest impact. Additionally, officials permitted full use of the Mexican railway system to facilitate the distribution of aid. Three municipalities were also declared disaster areas following the storm. In Texas, the combination of moderate rainfall and high tides into low-lying marshland led to <b>a</b> <b>mosquito</b> outbreak near Galveston following the storm.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} after Allison, FEMA opened six {{disaster}} recovery centers across southeast Texas, which provided recovery information to those who applied for disaster assistance. The American Red Cross and the Salvation Army opened 48shelters {{at the peak of}} need for people driven from their homes, which served nearly 300,000meals. The National Disaster Medical System deployed a temporary hospital to Houston with 88 professionals, aiding nearly 500people. Thirty-five volunteer services provided aid for the flood victims in Texas, including food, clothing, and volunteers to help repair the houses. After nearly 50,000cars were flooded and ruined, many people attempted to sell the cars across the country without telling of the car's history. Following the extreme flooding, <b>a</b> <b>mosquito</b> outbreak occurred, though FEMA provided aid to control the problem. By six months after the storm, around 120,000 Texas citizens applied for federal disaster aid, totaling to $1.05billion (2001USD, $1.36billion 2012USD).|$|E
5|$|After departing {{the area}} {{he reached the}} west coast, but Braham had loitered for too long. He spotted two Fw 190s {{approaching}} fast from the east. Braham had shot down two of these machines in <b>a</b> <b>Mosquito</b> but he was uncertain of how experienced these pilots had been. There was no cloud cover and the Mosquito could not outrun the faster and more agile single-engine fighters for long. He decided to turn and fight while he still could. In a head-on attack the first Fw 190 pilot missed but the second struck the port wing and engine with cannon fire causing a large fire. The instrument panel and cockpit window was shot through missing both Walsh and Braham by inches. Braham dived to the sea levelling out below 100 feet. He tried to use the fire extinguisher to stop the fire. The German pilot shared Braham's philosophy of ensuring a kill by shooting at an enemy aircraft until it came down. The Mosquito was hit again and Braham crash-landed his aircraft onto a beach at 150 miles per hour.|$|E

5|$|Although spiders {{are widely}} feared, {{only a few}} species are {{dangerous}} to people. Spiders will only bite humans in self-defense, and few produce worse effects than <b>a</b> <b>mosquito</b> bite or bee-sting. Most of those with medically serious bites, such as recluse spiders and widow spiders, would rather flee and bite only when trapped, although this can easily arise by accident. Funnel web spiders' defensive tactics include fang display and their venom, although they rarely inject much, has resulted in 13 known human deaths over 50 years. They have been deemed to be the world's most dangerous spiders on clinical and venom toxicity grounds, though this claim has also been attributed to the Brazilian wandering spider, due to much more frequent accidents.|$|E
5|$|As Heyer aged {{she began}} to suffer more {{frequent}} health problems. In June 1964, she underwent surgery to remove a kidney stone. Although the doctors initially predicted a six-week recovery, after two months they predicted {{that it might be}} a year or longer before she felt completely well. The following year, she suffered <b>a</b> <b>mosquito</b> bite that turned septic, prompting the doctors to offer skin grafts. In July 1973 she suffered a slight stroke and spent three weeks in a nursing home. When her brother Boris died later that year, Heyer was too ill to travel to his funeral. She suffered another stroke in February 1974. Three months later, she was diagnosed with lung cancer, which her biographer attributed to the 60–80 cork-tipped cigarettes that Heyer smoked each day (although she said she did not inhale). On 4 July 1974, Heyer died. Her fans learned her married name for the first time from her obituaries.|$|E
5|$|Immunity (or, more accurately, tolerance) to P.falciparum malaria {{does occur}} naturally, {{but only in}} {{response}} to years of repeated infection. An individual can be protected from a P.falciparum infection if they receive about a thousand bites from mosquitoes that carry {{a version of the}} parasite rendered non-infective by a dose of X-ray irradiation. The highly polymorphic nature of many P.falciparum proteins results in significant challenges to vaccine design. Vaccine candidates that target antigens on gametes, zygotes, or ookinetes in the mosquito midgut aim to block the transmission of malaria. These transmission-blocking vaccines induce antibodies in the human blood; when <b>a</b> <b>mosquito</b> takes a blood meal from a protected individual, these antibodies prevent the parasite from completing its development in the mosquito. Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the parasite's life cycle, have been inadequate on their own. For example, SPf66 was tested extensively in areas where the disease is common in the 1990s, but trials showed it to be insufficiently effective.|$|E

5|$|In many species, fleas are principally a {{nuisance}} to their hosts, causing an itching sensation {{which in turn}} causes the host to try to remove the pest by biting, pecking or scratching. Fleas are not simply a source of annoyance, however. Flea bites cause a slightly raised, swollen itching spot to form; this has a single puncture point at the centre, like <b>a</b> <b>mosquito</b> bite. Besides this, the eczematous itchy skin disease flea allergy dermatitis is common in many host species, including dogs and cats. The bites often appear in clusters or lines of two bites, and can remain itchy and inflamed for up to several weeks afterwards. Fleas can lead to hair loss {{as a result of}} frequent scratching and biting by the animal, and can cause anemia in extreme cases.|$|E
5|$|Like in Texas, <b>a</b> <b>mosquito</b> {{outbreak}} {{occurred in}} Louisiana. Only pesticides {{acceptable to the}} US Environmental Protection Agency and the US Fish and Wildlife Service were allowed to be used. FEMA officials warned homeowners {{of the dangers of}} floodwaters, including mold, mildew, and bacteria. By three months after the storm, just under 100,000 Louisiana citizens applied for federal aid, totaling to over $110million (2001USD, $143million 2012USD). $25million (2001USD, $32million 2012USD) of the total was for business loans, while an additional $8million was for public assistance for communities and state agencies. More than 750 flood victims in Florida applied for governmental aid, totaling to $1.29million (2001USD, $1.5million 2007USD). In Pennsylvania, 1,670 flood victims applied for federal aid, totaling to $11.5million (2001USD, $14.3million 2012USD). $3.4million (2001USD, $4.4million 2012USD) of the total was to replace a SEPTA rail bridge over Sandy Run in Fort Washington.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{methods have}} {{confirmed}} the high prevalence of P. falciparum malaria in ancient Egypt. The Ancient Greek historian Herodotus {{wrote that the}} builders of the Egyptian pyramids (circa 2700–1700 BCE) were given large amounts of garlic, probably to protect them against malaria. The Pharaoh Sneferu, {{the founder of the}} Fourth dynasty of Egypt, who reigned from around 2613–2589 BCE, used bed-nets as protection against mosquitoes. Cleopatra VII, the last Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt, similarly slept under <b>a</b> <b>mosquito</b> net. However, whether the mosquito nets were used for the purpose of malaria prevention, or for more mundane purpose of avoiding the discomfort of mosquito bites, is unknown. The presence of malaria in Egypt from circa 800 BCE onwards has been confirmed using DNA-based methods.|$|E
