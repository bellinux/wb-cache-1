5|$|In January, 2012, the Church of Scientology {{brought a}} lawsuit against Debbie Cook for {{defamation}} after she sent <b>an</b> <b>e-mail</b> <b>to</b> 3,000 Church members criticizing its fund-raising methods.

5|$|Although {{they fail}} to win the competition, a YouTube video of their {{performance}} gains the band popularity at school. David Bowie (portraying himself) sees the video and sends <b>an</b> <b>e-mail</b> <b>to</b> Will, explaining that he is starting an indie music label and is interested in having the band {{as one of their}} first artists. Will is so excited and overwhelmed that he falls {{down in the middle of}} the school hallway (close to the same position as the front cover of Bowie's Lodger album). The last scene takes place during Charlotte's graduation ceremony where Will and Sa5m are confirmed as dating.|$|E
5|$|Marge is irritated when Homer's snoring (so loud, it can {{be heard}} {{throughout}} most of the city) keeps her up at night. She sees Dr. Hibbert about the problem, and asks about a surgery, but he says it is expensive and tells them to get out when Homer asks him to do it for free. Developing a sleep problem, she sleeps for a night with Patty and Selma, and hears on the news that her old boyfriend, Artie Ziff, is one of America's five richest people. She drunkenly dictates <b>an</b> <b>e-mail</b> <b>to</b> Artie to congratulate him on his appearance, but Patty and Selma doctor it to use sexual terms in an attempt to split up Marge and Homer, much to Marge's horror (for using the word sex on the Internet). Artie, who over the years seems to have developed a rather frightening obsession with Marge (his house is decorated with a large number of 'Marge' sculptures/paintings), flies in his helicopter to the Simpson house to see Marge.|$|E

25|$|The {{code that}} would become WebKit began in 1998 as the KDE HTML (KHTML) layout engine and KDE JavaScript (KJS) engine. The WebKit project was begun within Apple by Don Melton on June 25, 2001 as a fork of KHTML and KJS. Melton {{explained}} in <b>an</b> <b>e-mail</b> <b>to</b> KDE developers that KHTML and KJS allowed easier development than other available technologies {{by virtue of being}} small (fewer than 140,000 lines of code), cleanly designed and standards-compliant. KHTML and KJS were ported to OS X {{with the help of an}} adapter library and renamed WebCore and JavaScriptCore. JavaScriptCore was announced in <b>an</b> <b>e-mail</b> <b>to</b> a KDE mailing list in June 2002, alongside the first release of Apple's changes. WebCore was announced at the Macworld Expo in January 2003 by Apple CEO Steve Jobs with the release of the Safari web browser. JavaScriptCore was first included with Mac OS X v10.2 as a private framework which Apple used in their Sherlock application, while WebCore debuted with the first beta of Safari. Mac OS X v10.3 was the first major release of Apple's operating system to bundle WebKit, although it had already been bundled with a minor release of 10.2.|$|E
