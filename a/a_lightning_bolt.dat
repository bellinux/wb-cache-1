5|$|The {{temperature}} of <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> <b>bolt</b> can be five times hotter than {{the surface of}} the sun. Although the lightning is extremely hot, the duration is short and 90% of strike victims survive. Contrary to the popular idea that lightning does not strike twice in the same spot, some people have been struck by lightning over three times, and skyscrapers like the Empire State Building have been struck numerous times in the same storm.|$|E
5|$|The {{protagonist of}} the game is Lester Knight Chaykin, a young genius physicist. In the opening cinematic, Lester arrives at his {{high-tech}} underground laboratory in his Ferrari 288 GTO during a thunderstorm and goes to work on his experiment using a particle accelerator, attempting to reconstruct what happened when the universe was born. Immediately before the particles reach their intended destination, <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> <b>bolt</b> strikes the laboratory and interferes with the accelerator, causing an unforeseen particle fusion and an explosion, opening a hole in time and space and teleporting Lester to a barren, alien planet.|$|E

5|$|To {{test his}} theory, Franklin {{proposed}} a potentially deadly experiment, {{to be performed}} during an electrical storm, where a person would stand on an insulated stool inside a sentry box, and hold out a long pointed iron rod to attract <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> <b>bolt.</b> This experiment was first performed successfully in France On May 10, 1752, and later repeated several more times throughout Europe. Franklin proved by this sentry-box experiment that lightning and electricity were one and the same.|$|E
5|$|At a dock {{owned by}} Shell Oil Company in Deer Park near Houston, <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> <b>bolt</b> from {{thunderstorms}} of Elena struck the oil supertanker SS Chevron Hawaii. The lightning started a {{fire on the}} ship, which expanded and wrecked one adjacent barge and burned nearby docks. The ship was nearly split in half from the lightning strike, and oil seeped into Houston Ship Channel for several hours. Firefighters combated the fire on the tanker in boats, but their efforts were hindered due to unsettled weather from Elena, as well as unsafe water to travel through. The fire caused three deaths and 13 injuries, and damage related to the incident totaled $27 million (1979 USD, $76 million 2007 USD).|$|E

25|$|The {{lightning}} bolt {{is used to}} represent the instantaneous communication capabilities of electrically powered telegraphs and radios. It was a commonly used motif in Art Deco design, especially the zig-zag Art Deco design of the late 1920s. The {{lightning bolt}} is a common insignia for military communications units throughout the world. <b>A</b> <b>lightning</b> <b>bolt</b> is also the NATO symbol for a signal asset.|$|E

25|$|The {{time machine}} is {{electric}} and requires a power input of 1.21 jigowatts (gigawatts) to operate, originally {{provided by a}} plutonium-fueled nuclear reactor. In the first movie, Doc has no access to plutonium in 1955, so he outfits the car with a large pole and hook in order to channel the power of <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> <b>bolt</b> into the flux capacitor and send Marty back to 1985. During Doc's first visit to 2015, he has the machine refitted to hover above ground in addition to standard road driving, and he replaces the nuclear reactor with a Mr. Fusion generator that uses garbage as fuel.|$|E
25|$|With a {{crash of}} thunder and lightning, the power {{suddenly}} goes out, {{except for the}} television set which crackles into life and plays the opening sequence from {{the fourth and fifth}} seasons of The Twilight Zone, hosted by Rod Serling. The episode goes on to depict the events of a stormy night in 1939 when <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> <b>bolt</b> struck the tower and caused five people—a celebrity couple, a rising child star, her nanny, and a hotel bellhop—to vanish from the elevator.

25|$|The city's main Roman Catholic church, Our Lady of the Candelaria (plot consecrated on 21 August 1760, first masonry {{building}} {{erected in}} 1780, current church originally built in 1836) was rebuilt in 1922. The original redesign by architect Luis Perocier sought {{to restore the}} building to its original splendor. Not only had the 1918 earthquake destroyed the temple's ceiling, but <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> <b>bolt</b> also struck and tore down a wedge-shaped corner {{of one of its}} two bell towers. However, lack of proper funding and the extent of the damage of the original structure forced the actual rebuilding of the church to be scaled-down considerably.|$|E
50|$|The patch is a {{royal blue}} {{equilateral}} triangle, bordered in gold, standing on its vertex. A white unicorn, its features outlined in blue, {{stands in the}} center. <b>A</b> golden <b>lightning</b> <b>bolt</b> overlaps the unicorn and forms {{the shape of a}} large seven.|$|R

The fist on the Insignia is actually Zeus' fist from Greek Mythology.|$|R
25|$|A {{modeling}} {{system based on}} {{a better understanding of}} the termination targeting of lightning, called the Rolling Sphere Method, was developed by Dr Tibor Horváth. It has become the standard by which traditional Franklin Rod systems are installed. To understand this requires knowledge of how lightning 'moves'. As the step leader of <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> <b>bolt</b> jumps toward the ground, it steps toward the grounded objects nearest its path. The maximum distance that each step may travel is called the critical distance and is proportional to the electric current. Objects are likely to be struck if they are nearer to the leader than this critical distance. It is standard practice to approximate the sphere's radius as 46m near the ground.|$|E
25|$|Shao Kahn and Darkseid {{are the key}} villains in the {{crossover}} game Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, {{though both}} are playable characters. In the game's plot, a defeated Shao Kahn limps into a graveyard where he meets with his secret ally Quan Chi. They are confronted by Raiden, who uses <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> <b>bolt</b> on Shao Kahn, which knocks him into Quan Chi’s portal. This event, along with a parallel one between Superman and Darkseid in the DC Universe, results {{in the creation of}} Dark Kahn, who serves as the main antagonist in the game. After Dark Kahn is defeated, Shao Kahn ends up in the DC Universe's Darkseid's throne room, where he discovers he has lost his powers. He is promptly imprisoned in the Phantom Zone.|$|E
25|$|On August 7, 1973, {{while he}} was out on patrol in the park, Sullivan saw a storm cloud forming and drove away quickly. But the cloud, he said later, seemed to be {{following}} him. When he finally thought he had outrun it, he decided {{it was safe to}} leave his truck. Soon after, he was struck by <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> <b>bolt.</b> Sullivan stated that he actually saw the bolt that hit him. The lightning set his hair on fire, moved down his left arm and left leg and knocked off his shoe. It then crossed over to his right leg just below the knee. Still conscious, Sullivan crawled to his truck and poured the can of water, which he always kept there, over his head, which was on fire.|$|E

50|$|The {{problem had}} been easily {{identified}} by <b>a</b> chalk <b>lightning</b> <b>bolt</b> drawn by John Bachar in 1978 while attempting {{the problem with}} John Yablonski and Ron Kauk. In May 2013, the iconic chalk <b>lightning</b> <b>bolt</b> was scrubbed {{off the face of}} the boulder. The bolt was re-drawn in the same location a few days later. The climb is rated at V8 on the Hueco scale of difficulty.|$|R
25|$|On 28 June 2012, <b>a</b> large <b>lightning</b> <b>bolt</b> {{struck the}} Tyne Bridge. It {{lit up the}} roads as the sky was very dark.
