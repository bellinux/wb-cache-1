5000|$|Not {{all of the}} {{passenger}} aircraft flying today have an autopilot system. Older and smaller general aviation aircraft especially are still hand-flown, and even small airliners with fewer than twenty seats may also be without an autopilot as they are used on short-duration flights with two pilots. The installation of autopilots in aircraft with more than twenty seats is generally made mandatory by international aviation regulations. There are three levels of <b>control</b> in <b>autopilots</b> for smaller aircraft. A single-axis <b>autopilot</b> <b>controls</b> an aircraft in the roll axis only; such autopilots are also known colloquially as [...] "wing levellers," [...] reflecting their limitations. A two-axis <b>autopilot</b> <b>controls</b> an aircraft in the pitch axis as well as roll, and may {{be little more than}} a [...] "wing leveller" [...] with limited pitch oscillation-correcting ability; or it may receive inputs from on-board radio navigation systems to provide true automatic flight guidance once the aircraft has taken off until shortly before landing; or its capabilities may lie somewhere between these two extremes. A three-axis <b>autopilot</b> adds <b>control</b> in the yaw axis and is not required in many small aircraft.|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} experimental autopilot-controlled landings {{in commercial}} service {{were not in}} fact full auto landings but were termed [...] "auto-flare". In this mode the pilot controlled the roll and yaw axes manually while the <b>autopilot</b> <b>controlled</b> the [...] "flare" [...] or pitch. These were often done in passenger service {{as part of the}} development program. The Trident's autopilot had separate engagement switches for the pitch and roll components, and although the normal autopilot disengagement was by means of a conventional control yoke thumb-button, it was also possible to disengage the roll channel while leaving the pitch channel engaged. In these operations the pilot had acquired full visual reference, normally well above decision height, but instead of fully disengaging the autopilot with the thumb-button, called for the second officer to latch off the roll channel only. He then controlled the lateral flight path manually while monitoring the <b>autopilot's</b> continued <b>control</b> of the vertical flight path - ready to completely disengage it {{at the first sign of}} any deviation. While this sounds as if it may add a risk element in practice it is of course no different in principle to a training pilot monitoring a trainee's handling during on-line training or qualification.|$|R

Precise control of ship has known an {{increasing}} interest in the last years. The main benefits of usage of <b>autopilot</b> for <b>control</b> of ship can be elimination of {{a man from the}} dangers of the undersea environment and reduction in cost of exploration of deep seas.

The first system, based on the action of a displacement gyroscope only, was investigated to find the cause of a small-amplitude pitch oscillation which had been noted in previous flight tests. The results of the investigation conducted revealed that, although the autopilot-model combination was dynamically stable, a hunting oscillation was possible due to a change in autopilot characteristics in a dive. This hunting condition can be eliminated by increasing the gyroscope pickoff dead spot without greatly reducing dynamic stability of the autopilot-model combination...|$|E
