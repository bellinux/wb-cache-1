5|$|In 1969 {{the large}} Allied Breweries combine {{initiated}} a {{hostile takeover bid}} for Boddingtons, which valued the company at £5million. Charles Boddington took {{the unusual step of}} issuing a spirited defence of the company to the shareholders: You will be only too aware that present-day pressures bear heavily towards the elimination of individuality and character in many consumer goods. There is an inexorable progression towards the mass-produced nationwide product of standardised quality. You, however, are still, at this moment in time, a shareholder in one of the remaining independent brewery companies whose traditional draught beers have a reputation for quality and individual character beyond the immediate area of the North of England in which we operate... The takeover of Boddingtons and its consequent elimination can achieve very little. It will do nothing for the national economy, add nothing to the nation's exports, and contribute nothing at <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> quality of life that we are all used to enjoy.|$|E
5|$|In the Outer Hebrides {{all of the}} {{inhabited}} {{islands are}} now connected {{to at least one}} other island by a land transport route, but only four Inner Hebridean islands are connected by road, <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mainland. The Clachan Bridge from Argyll to Seil was designed by Thomas Telford and dates from 1792. Skye has been connected to Kyle of Lochalsh by the Skye Bridge since 1995. Danna is also connected to the Tayvallich peninsula in Argyll by a stone causeway; and tiny Eilean Donan, dominated by its castle, has had a connection to the mainland perhaps from as early as the 13th century. The arched bridge in use today was constructed in the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Mingulay boasts {{three large}} sea stacks: Arnamul (Old Norse: Erne mound), Lianamul (Old Norse: Flax mound) and Gunamul, {{which has a}} natural arch in 150m (490ft) cliffs through which boats can sail on rare days when the restless sea is calm. There are several {{outlying}} islets including the twin rocks of Sròn a Dùin to the south-west, Geirum Mòr and Geirum Beag to the south between Mingulay and the nearby island of Berneray, and Solon Mòr ('Big Gannet'), Solon Beag ('Little Gannet'), Sgeirean nan Uibhein, Barnacle Rock and a smaller stack called The Red Boy, <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north between Mingulay and Pabbay.|$|E

Early thoughts focused on nitric oxide, while most recent evidence points to cell adhesion proteins.|$|E
5|$|The Nifo oti, or Samoan fire knife dance, {{is also a}} kind {{of weapon}} dance. The kailao is a {{standing}} male war dance of Tonga. The kailao is performed by men (less commonly women also perform it with the men as a mixed dance), who carry clubs or fighting sticks. The performers dance in a fierce manner to emulate combat, <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> accompaniment of a slit drum or a tin box. Additional idiophonic percussion is provided by strung rattles worn on the anklets of the dancers, and the clashing together of the wooden implements of war, which today are either sticks or mock weapons. The dance is unusual for Tonga in that it lacks recited poetry as accompaniment, which fact is taken to mean that it was imported to Tonga from elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Elle {{manages to}} {{convince}} Paul to sign over {{his share of}} Lassiter's {{to her and she}} leaves him with nothing. Paul has a brain tumour removed and he loses his memory. He later apologises to his neighbours for all the bad things he did. Paul begins a relationship with Oliver's mother, Rebecca Napier, and she and her youngest son, Declan (James Sorensen), move in with him. Remembering that he murdered Gus, Paul confesses <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> police and Gus's sister Laura (Jodi Flockhart). The police inform Paul {{that they will not be}} pursuing the case, while Laura and her boyfriend Nick Thompson (Marty Grimwood) try to blackmail Paul by kidnapping Declan. Paul has an affair with Kirsten Gannon (Nikola Dubois) and Rebecca ends their relationship. Paul regains his assets from Elle and he buys the Erinsborough News. Paul briefly dates Cassandra Freedman (Tottie Goldsmith), but he and Rebecca soon reconcile. Paul is initially blamed for his half-sister Jill Ramsay's (Perri Cummings) death. He goes on the run, but his name is cleared by Jill's daughter Sophie (Kaiya Jones). When Paul and Rebecca get engaged, Lyn interrupts their wedding to announce she and Paul are still married. After divorcing Lyn, Paul marries Rebecca.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} that crossing the Void causes a traveller to become saturated in Void material. If {{he opens the}} breach and reverses it, anything saturated in Void material will be pulled in. Everyone except Jackie has crossed the breach and is thus vulnerable to being trapped in the Void, so the Doctor sends them <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> parallel universe. Rose decides she would rather be with the Doctor than her family and jumps back to help him. The Cybermen attempt to stop the Doctor but are repelled by a converted Ms. Hartman, who has resisted the effects of her conversion and at least partially retains her sense of self. The Doctor and Rose open the breach and hang on to magnetic clamps as the Cybermen and Daleks are pulled in. The Cult of Skaro use an emergency temporal shift to escape. Rose's lever slips, and in resetting it she loses her grip and plunges toward the Void. At the last second, Pete reappears and grabs her, and together they transport back to the parallel universe. The breach closes, leaving a devastated Rose trapped in the parallel universe. The devices used to travel between the two worlds have also stopped working. The Doctor presses his ear against the wall, as a tearful Rose does {{the same in the}} other universe, as if trying to listen for each other.|$|E

25|$|The {{choice of}} {{bacteria}} {{and of its}} virus, the bacteriophage, as models {{for the study of}} the fundamental mechanisms of life was almost natural - they are the smallest living organisms known to exist - and at the same time the fruit of individual choices. This model owes its success, above <b>all,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fame and the sense of organization of Max Delbrück, a German physicist, who was able to create a dynamic research group, based in the United States, whose exclusive scope was the study of the bacteriophage: the phage group.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s {{there was}} a concern that Mysen and Eidsberg would see a {{shrinking}} population. However, instead {{an increasing number of}} people started commuting to jobs in and around Oslo. By 1970 a quarter of the workforce were commuting, almost <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> capital. This led to a major change in the traffic pattern on the Eastern Østfold Line. Mysen became the end of train services, with the extensions to Sarpsborg closed down in 1986. At the same time NSB made more intensive its commuter service.|$|E

The Scottish Labour Party lost forty of their forty-one seats and the Scottish Liberal Democrats lost ten of their eleven seats – <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> SNP.

25|$|The {{opening and}} credits {{sequences}} of most anime television episodes {{are accompanied by}} Japanese pop or rock songs, often by reputed bands. They may be written with the series in mind, but are also aimed at the general music market, and therefore often allude only vaguely or not at <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> themes or plot of the series. Pop and rock songs are also sometimes used as incidental music ("insert songs") in an episode, often to highlight particularly important scenes.|$|E
25|$|The {{underlying}} {{justifications for}} DADT {{have been subjected}} to increasing suspicion and outright rejection by the early 21st century. Mounting evidence obtained from the integration efforts of foreign militaries, surveys of U.S. military personnel, and studies conducted by the DoD gave credence to the view that the presence of open homosexuals within the military would not be detrimental at <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> armed forces. A DoD study conducted on the behest of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in 2010 supports this most.|$|E

These policies brought him into conflict with his uncles, who were also legitimate heirs to the throne; they regarded Temujin not as leader but merely an insolent usurper. This controversy spread to his generals and other associates, and some Mongols who had previously been allies with him broke their allegiance.|$|E
