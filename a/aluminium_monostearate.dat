50|$|<b>Aluminium</b> <b>monostearate</b> is {{an organic}} {{compound}} {{which is a}} salt of stearic acid and aluminium. It has the molecular formula Al(OH)2C18H35O2. It is {{also referred to as}} dihydroxy(octadecanoato-O-)aluminium or dihydroxy(stearato)aluminium.|$|E
40|$|Rabbits have {{commonly}} {{been used}} for testing the blood-level duration limit of penicillin, but have proved not to be entirely suitable. Experiments reported in this paper {{on the use of}} sheep suggest that these animals can be successfully used for the testing of procaine benzylpenicillin with <b>aluminium</b> <b>monostearate</b> (PAM) ...|$|E
40|$|Post-treatment {{observation}} of two years' duration has confirmed preliminary data which {{indicated that a}} single injection of 2. 5 million units of benzathine penicillin G, in early infectious syphilis, produces results equal, if not superior, to those obtained with schedules employing 4. 8 million units of procaine penicillin and <b>aluminium</b> <b>monostearate...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} {{procaine}} benzylpenicillin in oil with <b>aluminium</b> <b>monostearate</b> (PAM) {{described in this}} paper was undertaken to devise laboratory assay methods, based on animal tests, to evaluate those properties of PAM responsible for the persistence of penicillin in the circulation, as a preferable substitute for the existing test in man. Comparative studies {{of a number of}} batches of PAM in man proved, with statistical certainty, that the duration of the blood level of penicillin which they produced varied from batch to batch. The chemical and physical properties of the batches gave inadequate characterization and were of no value in assessing material for clinical use. A blood level duration test in rabbits was developed which reflected the blood level duration properties shown in man. The test was incorporated in the Requirements for Procaine Benzylpenicillin in Oil with <b>Aluminium</b> <b>Monostearate</b> that were set up by the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization to ensure the suitability of batches for clinical use. An International Reference Preparation was necessary and was established. Batches of PAM in use in the field by WHO in anti-yaws campaigns were examined by the test described and found to be satisfactory...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} {{syphilis}} in Bosnia was organised and started by Professor Ernest Grin in 1948 {{and continued to}} the end of 1951. Regardless of the clinical picture, the treatment of endemic syphilis consisted of an oil suspension of penicillin with <b>aluminium</b> <b>monostearate</b> (PAM) 3. 6 to 4. 2 MIU for adults in six or seven intramuscular injections of 0. 6 MIU every day or 1. 2 MIU every other day. Today endemic syphilis in Yugoslavia is only historic fact...|$|E
40|$|The second International Reference Preparation of Procaine Benzylpenicillin in Oil with <b>Aluminium</b> <b>Monostearate</b> was {{established}} in replacement of the first international reference preparation. The blood-level duration test (WHO Requirements for Biological Substances, No. 9), used to evaluate batches of manufactured material in relation to this reference preparation, was revised {{to relate to the}} new reference preparation. Thus a batch now passes the test if the lower confidence limit of the ratio is greater than 0. 45, instead of 0. 50 â€”the value that related to the first international reference preparation. This change will ensure that material passing the test in the future will be of the same quality as in the past...|$|E
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of penicillin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were compared simultaneously {{with those in}} the serum in 17 patients with syphilis. The antibiotic concentrations were measured by the agar well diffusion method. There were no detectable {{concentrations of}} penicillin in the CSF after administration of benzathine penicillin 2. 4 megaunits, benzathine penicillin 7. 2 megaunits, procaine penicillin in <b>aluminium</b> <b>monostearate</b> (PAM) 12 megaunits, or aqueous procaine penicillin G 2. 4 megaunits. Only after high doses of aqueous penicillin G 24 megaunits daily or aqueous penicillin G 2 megaunits daily together with oral probenecid 2 g daily was penicillin detectable in the CSF. The concentrations after the latter regimen were the highest and much higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration for Treponema pallidum...|$|E
40|$|An {{extensive}} yaws {{eradication campaign}} has been in operation in Haiti since 1950; this paper deals with material from a special clinic set up at Bainet to evaluate the results of single injections of procaine penicillin with 2 % <b>aluminium</b> <b>monostearate</b> (PAM) in various dosages. Treatment results in 862 patients with darkfield-positive secondary yaws and given 600 000 units of PAM are analysed according to age and sex; according to whether the patients lapsed from observation for relatively long periods during the first post-treatment year; and, since an unsatisfactory PAM preparation was used early in the campaign, according to the preparation received. Analyses are also made of results in patients with primary yaws receiving 600 000 units of PAM and in patients with secondary yaws receiving 300 000 units or 150 000 units...|$|E
40|$|Four {{villages in}} Kordofan Province of the Sudan were {{selected}} by the authors to determine the effectiveness of mass prophylactic treatment with sulfa drugs and penicillin in controlling cerebrospinal meningitis epidemics in rural areas with highly primitive living conditions. Sulfadimidine was given orally {{in two of the}} villages, and procaine penicillin G in oil with 2 % <b>aluminium</b> <b>monostearate</b> (PAM) was given intramuscularly in the other two. The population of the villages was classified by age and by sex and given the following prophylactic doses: in Kaldung village, where 93 % of the population was treated, 4 g of sulfadimidine were given to persons over 15 years of age, 2. 5 g to those between 15 and 5, and 1. 5 g to those under 5; in Korongo Abdulla, the same age-groups received 2. 0 g, 1. 0 g, and 0. 5 g, respectively, and 34 % of the population was treated; in El Machicha and Miri Bara villages, PAM was given to 38 % and 90 % of the respective populations in the dosage of 150, 000 units to those over 15 years of age, 100, 000 units to those between 15 and 5, and 75, 000 to those under 5...|$|E
