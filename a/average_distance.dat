Additionally, HIP 78530 b orbits its host star at an estimated <b>average</b> <b>distance</b> of 710 AU, which is 710 times the <b>average</b> <b>distance</b> between the Earth and the Sun assuming the brown dwarf has a circular orbit.

5|$|Jupiter is {{the only}} planet whose {{barycenter}} with the Sun lies outside {{the volume of the}} Sun, though by only 7% of the Sun's radius. The <b>average</b> <b>distance</b> between Jupiter and the Sun is 778 millionkm (about 5.2 times the <b>average</b> <b>distance</b> between Earth and the Sun, or 5.2 AU) and it completes an orbit every 11.86years. This is approximately two-fifths the orbital period of Saturn, forming a near orbital resonance between the two largest planets in the Solar System. The elliptical orbit of Jupiter is inclined 1.31° compared to Earth. Because the eccentricity of its orbit is 0.048, Jupiter's distance from the Sun varies by 75 millionkm between its nearest approach (perihelion) and furthest distance (aphelion).|$|E

From 1871, the American entomologist Charles Valentine Riley warned Europeans about the potential for an accidental infestation caused by the transportation of the beetle from America.

As a result, Kepler-6b is {{strongly}} irradiated by its star, heating its atmosphere to a temperature of 1660 K and puffing {{it up to a}} size 1.3 times that of Jupiter. It may also be the case that Kepler-6b has a thermal inversion of its atmosphere, where temperature increases with increasing distance {{from the center of the}} planet.

40|$|Near {{free edges}} of fibre {{reinforced}} composite laminates modelled with homogeneous layers, {{the presence of}} high gradient interlaminar stresses has been found theoretically. Over a span of nearly 50 years, various methods, including numerical and analytical have been employed for analysis of the high gradient stresses which sometimes exist to an extent of a singularity. The analysis of such free edge stresses {{is found to be}} computationally expensive. However, since the interlaminar stresses have been found {{to play a role in}} initiating delamination in composite laminates, it becomes imperative to get an estimate of the interlaminar stresses near the free edge to be able to predict delamination initiation through suitable criteria. The abrupt material discontinuity between dissimilar layers in a homogeneously modelled laminate is believed to be a reason for the appearance of high gradients or singularities theoretically. The mitigation of material discontinuities at such interfaces could be done by modelling the laminate heterogeneously so that the interface is modelled by matrix material and hence, a discontinuity of material could be avoided. This idea of modelling the layers of laminate with explicit definition of fibre and matrix materials has inspired the thesis project with a view to investigate the difference in free edge stresses between the two models and to further draw a correlation between the stresses from the two models to predict delamination initiation. In previously published literature, the use of average interlaminar stresses up to a certain characteristic distance from the free edge through criterion for delamination initiation prediction is reported. Further it is also found that a single <b>averaging</b> <b>distance</b> can be proposed for a combination of laminates made of the same material. This encourages the idea of determination of <b>averaging</b> <b>distance</b> for a material and find its application on a laminate susceptible to delamination initiation. In the course of the current work, a correlation is proposed between the stresses of homogeneous and heterogeneous model [0 / 90]s cross-ply laminate of equivalent stiffness made of T 300 / 934 material to determine the <b>averaging</b> <b>distance</b> and apply the determined <b>averaging</b> <b>distance</b> on [± 25 / 90]s laminate to predict delamination initiation due to high gradient free edge stresses. An <b>averaging</b> <b>distance</b> of 0. 125 mm is determined for [± 25 / 90]s laminate made of T 300 / 934 material to find average stresses for incorporation into criterion for delamination initiation. It is found that the determined <b>averaging</b> <b>distance</b> predicts delamination initiation successfully for experimentally reported delamination initiation strain range for the [± 25 / 90]s laminate. Further, the convergence of average of high gradient interlaminar stress is found to be computationally more efficient than the convergence of high gradient interlaminar stress themselves. This indicates that use of average of high gradient interlaminar stresses is an efficient means for predicting free edge stress induced delamination initiation...|$|R
5|$|Many seabirds show {{remarkable}} site fidelity, {{returning to}} the same burrow, nest or site for many years, and they will defend that site from rivals with great vigour.

This tendency, known as philopatry, is so strong that a study of Laysan albatrosses found that the <b>average</b> <b>distance</b> between hatching site and the site where a bird established its own territory was 22m; another study, this time on Cory's shearwaters nesting near Corsica, found that of nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their natal colony bred in the burrow they were raised in, and two actually bred with their own mother.|$|E
