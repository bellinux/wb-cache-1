Such stock has been acquired from Tokyo, Nagoya, and Madrid.

30|$|The {{results provide}} partial support for our {{hypothesis}} that increasing spreading activation in emotional memory networks {{would be associated}} with greater changes in heart rate and skin conductance due to <b>the</b> cumulative effect <b>of</b> an increasing number of somatic markers being activated. Both <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> emotional memory words and <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> memories were significantly correlated with changes in heart rate and skin conductance. However, there were some differences between the happy and sad conditions as well as between <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> emotional memory words and <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> memories. Specifically, there was a significant positive relationship between <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> happy word memories and heart rate but a significant negative relationship between <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> happy word memories and skin conductance. No significant relationships were found between <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> sad word memories and either heart rate or skin conductance. However, <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sad word memories was significantly positively correlated with skin conductance, but not with heart rate. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> happy word memories was not significantly correlated with either skin conductance or heart rate.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} cell age model forPenicillium chrysogenum fed-batch {{cultivation}} to supply a qualitative insight into morphology-associated dynamics. <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> segregated cell populations, such as growing cells, non-growing cells and intact productive cells, were estimated by this model. A combined model {{was obtained by}} incorporating <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cell sub-populations into a known but modified segregated kinetic model from literature. For simulations, no additional effort was needed for parameter identification since the cell age model has no internal parameters. Validation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> combined model was performed by 20 charges of industrial-scale penicillin cultivation. Meanwhile, only two charge-dependent parameters were required in the combined model among approximately 20 parameters in total. The model is thus easily transformed into an adaptive model for a further application in on-line state variables prediction and optimal schedulin...|$|R

His first Liverpool goal was 11 days later in a 3-2 derby comeback win after being two down to Everton. Liverpool had a second consecutive fifth place league finish. They exited the 1970-71 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup semi-finals to Leeds United. Brian Hall's goal clinched a 1970-71 FA Cup 2-1 comeback semi final over Everton. Heighway put Liverpool ahead in extra time in the final. Arsenal this time came back to win 2–1 for a Gunners League and cup double.|$|E

The <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> squad, 23.8 years, was the youngest team to become champions since the beginning of the 21st century. The following year Malmö FF qualified for the group stage of the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League by beating Ventspils, Sparta Prague and Red Bull Salzburg in the qualifying rounds. This was the first time the club qualified for the competition proper since the re-branding from the European Cup in the 1992–93 season and the first time since the 2000–01 season that a Swedish club qualified. In the following months Malmö FF defended their league title, winning their eighteenth Swedish championship and 21st Allsvenskan title. This was the first time a club defended the Allsvenskan title since the 2003 season.|$|E
5|$|In {{the past}} {{part of the}} {{population}} worked in coal mining, although there are no working mines in the area now. There is still a fairly large agricultural workforce and in light industry or service industries, although many people commute to surrounding cities for work. According to the 2011 Census the valley has a population of approximately 5,000, largely living in one of the dozen or so villages and in isolated farms and hamlets. The <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population is 42 years, with unemployment rates of 1–4% of all economically active people aged 16–74, however these figures are approximations because the ward areas covered and described in the census statistics do not relate exactly to the area of the valley. In the Indices of deprivation 2010 all of the areas within the valley were considered to be in the most affluent third in England.|$|E

5|$|Next in the {{geologic}} {{column is}} the -thick Toroweap Formation (see 6c in figure 1). It consists {{of red and}} yellow sandstone and shaly gray limestone interbedded with gypsum. The formation was deposited in a warm, shallow sea as the shoreline transgressed (invaded) and regressed (retreated) over the land. The <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rock is about 273million years. In modern times it is a ledge- and slope-former that contains fossils of brachiopods, corals, and mollusks along with other animals and various terrestrial plants. The Toroweap is divided into the following three members: Seligman is a slope-forming yellowish to reddish sandstone and siltstone. Brady Canyon is a cliff-forming gray limestone with some chert. Wood Ranch is a slope-forming pale red and gray siltstone and dolomitic sandstone. An unconformity marks {{the top of this}} formation.|$|E
5|$|The <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Politburo's {{members was}} 58 years in 1961, and 71 in 1981.

The difference in the median age between Politburo and Central Committee members {{can be explained by the}} fact that the Central Committee was consistently enlarged during Brezhnev's leadership; this made it possible to appoint new and younger members to the Central Committee without retiring some of its oldest members. Of the 319-member Central Committee in 1981, 130 were younger than 30 when Stalin died in 1953.|$|E
5|$|To {{replace the}} departing {{principals}} the LSO recruited rising young players including Hugh Maguire, Neville Marriner and Simon Streatfeild in the string sections, Gervase de Peyer and William Waterhouse in the woodwinds, and Barry Tuckwell and Denis Wick in the brass. With the new intake the orchestra rapidly advanced in standards and status. The <b>average</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LSO players dropped to about 30. In 1956 the orchestra visited South Africa {{to play at}} the Johannesburg Festival. The players were impressed by the dynamic director of the festival, Ernest Fleischmann, and engaged him as general secretary of the orchestra when the post fell vacant in 1959. He was the LSO's first professional manager; all his predecessors as secretary/managing director had been orchestral players combining the duties with their orchestral playing.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> theory <b>of</b> {{spreading}} activation proposes that <b>the</b> activation <b>of</b> a semantic memory node may spread along bidirectional associative {{links to other}} related nodes. Although this theory was originally proposed to explain semantic memory networks, a similar process {{may be said to}} exist with episodic or emotional memory networks. The Somatic Marker hypothesis proposes that remembering an emotional memory activates the somatic sensations associated with the memory. An integration of these two models suggests that as {{spreading activation}} in emotional memory networks increases, a greater number of associated somatic markers would become activated. This process would then result in greater changes in physiological functioning. We sought to investigate this possibility by having subjects recall words associated with sad and happy memories, in addition to a neutral condition. <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> memories and <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> word memories recalled were then correlated with measures of heart rate and skin conductance. The results indicated significant positive correlations between <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> happy word memories and heart rate (r = . 384, p = . 022) and between <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sad memories and skin conductance (r = . 556, p = . 001). Unexpectedly, a significant negative relationship was found between <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> happy word memories and skin conductance (r = −. 373, p = . 025). The results provide partial support for our hypothesis, indicating that increasing spreading activation in emotional memory networks activates an increasing number of somatic markers and this is then reflected in greater physiological activity at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> recalling <b>the</b> memories.|$|R
