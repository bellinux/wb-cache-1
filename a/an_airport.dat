5|$|Between 1925 and 1928, Ny-Ålesund saw four air {{expeditions to}} the North Pole, {{two of which}} {{required}} {{the construction of an}} airship hangar and mast. The first proposal for <b>an</b> <b>airport</b> in Ny-Ålesund was launched in 1956 by Norsk Polar Navigasjon, who proposed <b>an</b> <b>airport</b> at Kvadehuksletta. Soviet protests against the airport caused the Norwegian authorities to oppose the plans, which were laid to rest in the early 1960s. Construction at Hamnerabben started in 1965 following the decision to build Kongsfjord Telemetry Station. The airport first hosted service to temporary landing strips near Longyearbyen, but from 1975 served Svalbard Airport. Lufttransport started flights with helicopters in the 1980s, but from 1989 has flown with fixed-wing aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The first {{proposals}} for <b>an</b> <b>airport</b> on Værøy were {{launched by the}} government in the late 1960s. A 1968 meteorological report concluded that the island was highly susceptible for strong winds, dominantly from the west, which could cause problems for air traffic. Three locations were considered: Kvalnes, Røssnesvågen og Nordlandet. The Norwegian Meteorological Institute concluded in 1973 that Nordlandet was the most suitable location in terms of weather, but test flights showed otherwise. Nordlandet was the cheapest alternative. Estimates showed that the regularity at <b>an</b> <b>airport</b> would be significantly lower than at the existing heliport. This caused local politicians to wish to keep the existing service, but pressure from Røst caused Værøy politicians to support <b>an</b> <b>airport.</b> After initial protests against Nordlandet as a site, Mayor Asmund Berg accepted the location on 3 May 1984. There had not been conducted sufficient test flights to establish the wind conditions above the airport caused by Teisthammeren, a mountain next to the airport. Widerøe was opposed to the location of the airport.|$|E

5|$|The {{service is}} also used {{as a form of}} civil disobedience: in 2010, users {{expressed}} outrage over the Twitter Joke Trial by copying a controversial joke about bombing <b>an</b> <b>airport</b> and attaching the hashtag #IAmSpartacus, a reference to the Spartacus film and a sign of solidarity and support to a man controversially prosecuted after posting a tweet joking about bombing <b>an</b> <b>airport</b> if they cancelled his flight. #IAmSpartacus became the number one trending topic on Twitter worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft are {{inspected}} during {{maintenance operations}} either outdoors on <b>an</b> <b>airport</b> between flights, or in a hangar for longer-duration inspections. These inspections are conducted mainly by human operators, visually and sometimes using tools to assess defects. The project aims to improve inspections of aircraft and traceability. A database dedicated to each aircraft type, containing images and three-dimensional scans, will be updated after each maintenance. This allows for example {{to assess the}} propagation of a crack.|$|E
