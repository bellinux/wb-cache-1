5|$|Alston played {{high school}} {{football}} at Warren County High School as <b>a</b> <b>quarterback.</b> He later attended college at East Carolina University, where he played for the Pirates from 1999 to 2002.

50|$|John P.

A 2005 study by McDonald Mirabile found {{that there is no}} significant correlation between <b>a</b> <b>quarterback's</b> Wonderlic score and <b>a</b> <b>quarterback's</b> passer rating, and no significant correlation between <b>a</b> <b>quarterback's</b> Wonderlic score and <b>a</b> <b>quarterback's</b> salary. Similarly, <b>a</b> 2009 study by Brian D. Lyons, Brian J. Hoffman, and John W. Michel found that Wonderlic scores failed to positively and significantly predict future NFL performance for any position. Donovan McNabb, whose 14 score was the lowest of the five quarterbacks taken {{in the first round of}} the 1999 NFL Draft, had the longest and most successful career.|$|R
