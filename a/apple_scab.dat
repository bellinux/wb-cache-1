50|$|C. globosum are {{endophytic}} to many plants. Their asymptomatic colonization supports plant {{tolerance to}} metal toxicity. Heavy metals such as copper, suppress plant growth and disrupt metabolic processes, e.g. photosynthesis. When maize plants {{were treated with}} C. globosum, they expressed less growth inhibition and increased biomass. C. globosum is also known to reside in Ginkgo biloba plants. Such plants use this endophytic fungus to suppress bacterial pathogens. In fact, ascospore inoculation reduces bacterial disease symptoms such as wilting, <b>apple</b> <b>scabs,</b> and seed blight in treated plants. Enhancing plant stress tolerance and microbial defense, renders C. globosum application beneficial for agricultural use.|$|R

Harpin protein), Phoenix (a. i. Potassium phosphite) and Rigel (a. i. Salicylic acid derivative) applied at four different growth stages of tree development (bud break, green cluster, 90 % petal fall, early fruitlet) against the foliar pathogens Venturia inaequalis and Venturia pirina which cause <b>apple</b> and pear <b>scab</b> respectively. A conventional synthetic fungicide (penconazole) used within the UK for <b>apple</b> and pear <b>scab</b> control was included for comparison. Little efficacy as scab protectants was demonstrated when each SIR product and penconazole was applied at only two growth stages (bud break, green cluster). However when the above compounds were applied at three or more growth stages efficacy as scab protectants was confirmed. The synthetic fungicide penconazole provided greatest protection against <b>apple</b> and pear <b>scab</b> in both the 2006 and 2007 field trials. There was little difference in the magnitude of scab protection conferred by each SIR agent. Results suggest application {{of at least three}} sprays during bud break to early fruitlet formation with an appropriate SIR agent may provide a useful addition to existing methods of <b>apple</b> and pear <b>scab</b> management under field conditions.

30|$|Apple {{proliferation}} symptoms {{have also}} been frequently observed {{in the last decade}} in apple orchards in Asturias, in the North coast of Spain. This region has long tradition in cider-making, and most of the 10, 000  ha of apple orchards are cultivated almost exclusively to produce cider-apples. The majority of the surface devoted to apple production is occupied by traditional extensive orchards with big trees grown on seedling rootstocks. Since the early 1990 s, an increasing percentage of these old orchards have been substituted by new semi-intensive ones with trees growing on semi-dwarfing rootstocks (Dapena et al. 2005). Those orchards are planted with selected local cultivars tolerant to several common <b>apple</b> diseases (<b>scab,</b> canker, powdery mildew). The use of pesticide in both situations is very low, even null. Sprays are mainly made with narrow-spectrum insecticides against the codling moth (Cydia pomonella L.) or the rosy apple aphid (Dysaphis plantaginea Passerini). Such situation of low pressure of pesticide use potentially allows high abundance and diversity of insects in orchards (Miñarro et al. 2005, 2009). The immersion of those orchards in an agricultural landscape characterized by a mosaic of small and different-land-use plots separated by hedgerows, as well as the occurrence of a permanent rich floral groundcover, also favour insect abundance and richness (Miñarro and Prida 2013; Rosa García and Miñarro 2014).|$|R

40|$|Agricultural soils suppressive to soilborne plant {{pathogens}} occur worldwide, and {{for several}} of these soils the biological basis of suppressiveness has been described. Two classical types of suppressiveness are known. General suppression owes its activity to the total microbial biomass in soil and is not transferable between soils.

In Washington State, take-all decline results from the buildup of fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. that produce the antifungal metabolite 2, 4 -diacetylphloroglucinol. Producers of this metabolite may have a broader role in disease-suppressive soils worldwide.

40|$|SUMMARY: Series of {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} both in witro and in vivo on single conidial isolates of Venturia inaequalis and V. pirina. Relationships between colony type and sporulation in vitro were apparent in both species. In addition, isolates of V. inaequalis showed relationships between degree of resistance of host source, width of host range and stability of cultural characters and pathogenicity during storage in culture. Isolates of V. pirina showed no such relationships, cultural characters being invariably stable while pathogenicity rapidly declined in the storage conditions. Studies of nutritional requirements suggested no deficiencies in the synthetic abilities of either pathogen, but limiting nutritional factors were im-portant. Isolates of both species which differed widely in pathogenicity and other characteristics, reacted similarly to various culture media. The use of Venturia inaequalis (Cke.) Wint. as a test organism for the labora-tory evaluation of protective fungicides for use against the <b>apple</b> and pear <b>scab</b> diseases (Montgomery & Moore, 1938) requires the provision of a routine supply of conidia over long periods.

The range and scale of the economic influence of such outbreaks should be clarified to ensure the sustainable growth of these industries. This study evaluates the direct and indirect economic effects of outbreaks through a partial equilibrium approach and an input–output model; direct influences are measured {{on the basis of}} reduced production, and the estimated costs are 34, 926 million Korean Won (mKRW) (US$ 29. 79 million) and 11, 767 mKRW (US$ 10. 04 million) for apples and pears, respectively. The indirect effects are determined according to changes in the quantity of apples and pears supplied to the market; these effects can induce social welfare losses. These costs are estimated to be 305, 065 mKRW (US$ 259. 08 million) for apples infected with Marssonina blotch, which accounts for 186, 628 mKRW (US$ 158. 50 million) in producer surplus and 118, 437 mKRW (US$ 100. 58 million) in consumer surplus and 72, 693 mKRW (US$ 61. 74 million) for pears infected with scab, which accounts for 44, 106 mKRW (US$ 37. 46 million) in producer surplus and 28, 587 mKRW (US$ 24. 28 million) in consumer surplus.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to provide an ex ante {{assessment}} of the sustainability of genetically modified (GM) crops under the agricultural conditions prevailing in Switzerland. The study addressed the gaps in our knowledge relating to (1) the agronomic risks/benefits in production systems under Swiss conditions (at field and rotation/orchard level), (2) the economic and socio-economic impacts associated with altered farming systems, and (3) the agro-ecological risks/benefits of GM crops (at field and rotation/orchard level). The study was based on an inventory of GM crops and traits which may be available in the next decade, and on realistic scenarios of novel agricultural practices associated with the use of GM crops in conventional, integrated, and organic farming systems in Switzerland. The technology impact assessment was conducted using an adapted version of the matrix for “comparative assessment of risks and benefits for novel agricultural systems” developed for the UK. Parameter settings were based on information from literature sources and expert workshops. In a tiered approach, sustainability criteria were defined, an inventory of potentially available, suitable GM crops was drawn up, and scenarios of baseline and novel farming systems with GM crops were developed and subsequently submitted to economic, socio-economic, and agro-ecological assessments. The project had several system boundaries, which influenced the outcomes. It was limited to the main agricultural crops used for food and feed production and focused on traits that are relevant at the field level and are likely to be commercially available within a decade from the start of the project. The study assumed that there would be no statutory restrictions on growing GM crops in all farming systems and that they would be eligible for direct payments in the same way as non-GM crops. Costs for co-existence measures were explicitly excluded and it was assumed that GM foods could be marketed in the same way as non-GM foods at equal farm gate prices. The following model GM crops were selected for this study: (1) GM maize varieties with herbicide tolerance (HT), and with resistance to the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) and the corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera); (2) HT wheat; (3) GM potato varieties with resistance to late blight (Phytophthora infestans), to the nematode Globodera spp., and to the Colorado beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata); (4) HT sugar beet with resistance to “rhizomania” (beet necrotic yellow vein virus; BNYVV); (5) apples with traditionally bred or GM resistance to scab (Venturia inaequalis), and GM apples with stacked resistance to scab and fire blight (Erwinia amylovora). Scenarios for arable rotations and apple orchards were developed on the basis of the model crops selected. The impact assessments were conducted for the entire model rotations/orchards in order to explore cumulative effects as well as effects that depend on the farming systems (organic, integrated, and conventional). In arable cropping systems, herbicide tolerance had the most significant impact on agronomic practices in integrated and conventional farming systems. HT crops enable altered soil and weed management strategies. While no-till soil management benefited soil conservation, the highly efficient weed control reduced biodiversity. These effects accumulated over time due to the high proportion of HT crops in the integrated and conventional model rotations. In organic production systems, the effects were less pronounced, mainly due to non-use of herbicides. Traits affecting resistance to pests and diseases had a minor impact on the overall performance of the systems, mainly due to the availability of alternative crop protection tools or traditionally bred varieties. The use of GM crops had only a minor effect on the overall profitability of the arable crop rotations. In <b>apple</b> production systems, <b>scab</b> and fire blight resistance had a positive impact on natural resources as well as on local ecology due to the reduced need for spray passages and pesticide use. In integrated apple production, disease resistance increased profitability slightly, whereas in the organic scenario, both scab and fire blight resistance increased the profitability of the systems substantially. In conclusion, the ecological and socio-economic impacts identified in this study were highly context sensitive and were associated mainly with altered production systems rather than with the GM crops per se...|$|R
