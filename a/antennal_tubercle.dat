40|$|Spilomyia boschmai nov. spec. Female. — Length about 16 mm. The {{eyes are}} bare, brown, {{with a dark}} {{marginal}} area and a dark longitudinal band just behind the middle; furthermore a number of dark specks is present, especially in the anterior half. The face is bright yellow, without a dark median line; it is covered {{as far as the}} bases of the antennae with rather long, erect, yellow hairs. The frons is yellow with a black median stripe extending from the black vertex to the implantation of the antennae on the antennal tubercle; in the paratype, however, the base of the <b>antennal</b> <b>tubercle</b> is yellow, interrupted in the middle with black. The pubescence of the frons is shorter than that of the face and is of a black colour. The black median stripe broadens ventrally; over its entire length the breadth is about ⅓ of the total breadth of the frons. The vertex is covered with longish black hairs which have the upper half curved forwards. The ocelli are brown and are arranged in an equilateral triangle. The occiput is dusty gray and bears a row of short black bristles, behind which there is a row of longer black hairs. The antennae are brown; the third segment being slightly darker dorsally, it is rounded and about as long as the second segment. The arista is pale brown, it is longer than the antenna. The thorax is dull black with the usual colour-pattern. The yellow longitudinal lines are about parallel, their tops, which are somewhat narrowed, are slightly converging; the two posterior lines are fused to a crescentshaped spot. The pubescence is short, largely black and about erect; at the yellow areas the hairs are yellow. The pleura are black, somewhat shining, with 5 yellow spots; the pubescence is of a predominantly pale colour. The last yellow spot is much larger than the second last. The pteropleuron show...|$|E

40|$|Garthwaite等人在 1988 年證實一氧化氮可當作神經訊息傳遞分子，開啟生物神經訊息傳遞的新觀點。目前已知一氧化氮牽涉到昆蟲的發育及嗅覺與視覺系統的調控，然而未有直接證據證實一氧化氮在視覺系統的生成。為探討一氧化氮在昆蟲視覺系統扮演的角色，本研究從組織學和生理學兩方面進行探討。組織學方面利用NADPH diaphorase的染色方法探討蜜蜂 (Apis mellifera L.) 工蜂腦部一氧化氮合成酶的表現。結果發現視葉的lamina、medulla、chiasm與anterior optic tubercle、嗅葉、蕈狀體的α-lobe及其周圍皆具有一氧化氮合成酶，且其表現量隨日齡增加有升降的現象；其中羽化後 12 至 18 日齡的工蜂其一氧化氮合成酶在lamina的表現有明顯提升，此結果與工蜂發生出巢行為的時間相符合，推測一氧化氮可能與工蜂行為轉換有關。在生理學方面則是利用一氧化氮感測電極直接在黃斑黑蟋蟀 (Gryllus bimaculatus) 的medulla、台灣大蝗 (Chondracris rosea) 和蜜蜂的lamina等區域量測到由光刺激後造成的一氧化氮濃度變化。綜合上述結果推測蜜蜂工蜂腦內一氧化氮的生成與行為轉換或與視覺光適應有關。Since {{nitric oxide}} (NO) was {{discovered}} {{to act as}} a signaling molecule in the nervous system (Garthwaite et al., 1988), NO has opened a new dimension in the signal processing of nervous system. Additionally, NO is involved in the development, olfactory system and visual system of insect. Nevertheless, there is so far no direct evidence to demonstrate the physiological function of NO in the insect visual system. In this study, the role of NO in the insect visual system was investigated in both histology and physiology. In the histology, NADPH-diaphorase was used to detect the expression of nitric oxide synthases (NOS) in the brain of honeybee (Apis mellifera L.). The existence of NOS in the lamina, medulla, chiasm, anterior optic <b>tubercle,</b> <b>antennal</b> lobe, α-lobe and α-lobe around was observed, and the expression of NOS in the brain areas was age-dependent. The expression of NOS in the lamina was significantly aroused from 12 -day-old to 18 -day-old bee workers. This result matches the timing of worker's leaving beehive. Therefore, it is very likely that NO participates in behavior change of bee workers. In the physiology, NO sensor was used to record the NO responses in medulla of Gryllus bimaculatus, lamina of A. mellifera and Chondracris rosea. The light-evoked NO responses in the three insect species were recorded, indicating that NO is generally involved with the light adaptation of insect vision system. 中文摘要 i 英文摘要 ii 目錄 iii 前言 1 前人研究 3 昆蟲神經系統內一氧化氮的生成與生理作用 4 一氧化氮在昆蟲生理系統之研究 6 一氧化氮在昆蟲視覺系統之組織學研究 7 一氧化氮在昆蟲視覺系統之生理學研究 9 材料與方法 11 NOS在工蜂腦部表現之組織學染色 11 一、 供試動物 11 二、 試驗用藥品 11 三、 NADPH diaphorase染色 12 四、 染色結果數據分析 13 NO在昆蟲視葉之電生理反應試驗 14 一、 供試動物 14 二、 NO感測電極校正 15 三、 NO感測電極記錄 16 四、 視覺刺激 16 五、 藥劑試驗 17 六、 資料分析 17 結果 18 NOS在工蜂腦部表現之組織學染色 18 NO在昆蟲視葉之電生理反應試驗 19 一、 NO感測電極的感度校正 19 二、 在昆蟲視葉NO感測電極之適用性試驗 20 三、 昆蟲視葉NO反應之結果 20 討論 23 NOS在工蜂腦部之表現 23 NO與工蜂羽化初期的神經增生 24 NO與光刺激對工蜂分工行為的影響 26 NO在昆蟲視覺光、暗適應所扮演的角色 28 未來研究 30 參考文獻 32 表 43 圖 47 附錄 5...|$|R
