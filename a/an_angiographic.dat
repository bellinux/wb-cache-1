40|$|This {{observational}} single-center trial {{examines the}} safety and efficacy of unplanned endoluminal stenting {{for the treatment of}} <b>a</b> suboptimal <b>angiographic</b> result (defined as a residual stenosis after angioplasty of 40 % to 50 % without delayed runoff as estimated by visual assessment) after conventional coronary angioplasty in native, new-onset, coronary artery stenoses. Between October 1991 and April 1994, 101 patients with suboptimal results after coronary angioplasty in new-onset lesions were treated by endoluminal Wiktor (41 patients) and Palmaz-Schatz (60 patients) stent implantation. Stenting was <b>a</b> technical and <b>angiographic</b> success in all cases. In-hospital complications were subacute closure (2 %) and vascular complications at puncture site necessitating surgery (12 %) or blood transfusion (3 %). No myocardial infarction occurred, nor was any urgent bypass surgery performed. At follow-up restenosis was detected in 16 (20 %, 80 % angiographic follow-up rate) patients requiring repeat angioplasty (8 %) and elective bypass grafting (4 %). Myocardial infarction was not documented. However, one patient died suddenly at 5 months of follow-up. The unplanned use of intracoronary stents is a safe and effective therapeutic option for the treatment of <b>a</b> suboptimal <b>angiographic</b> result after conventional angioplasty in new-onset lesions. This approach guarantees <b>a</b> high immediate <b>angiographic</b> success but implies a considerable incidence of vascular complications at puncture site...|$|R
40|$|We have {{recently}} shown that gated radionuclide an giography {{in the left}} anterior oblique position {{can be used to}} calculate the ratio between LV and RV stroke volumes (1).

We have evaluated this approach by comparing measurements of valvular regurgitation made by this technique with (<b>a)</b> <b>angiographic</b> estimates in patients with mitral and aortic regurgitation, and with (b) direct flowmeter measurements of aortic regurgi tation in dogs with experimentally produced lesions (1 â€” 3).

40|$|We {{report the}} first {{clinical}} {{use of a}} new, flexible, low profile, balloon-expandable metallic stent and delivery system (ACS Multi-Link®). The stent, designed {{in an effort to}} overcome the shortcoming of existing stents, has a low metal mass, superior scaffolding properties and favourable rheological characteristics. It also allows side branch access and is delivered via an innovative stent catheter. Ten stents were used to treat 10 patients with threatened abrupt closure after balloon angioplasty. All were successfully deployed, with <b>a</b> satisfactory <b>angiographic</b> result in nine. The patient with <b>an</b> unsatisfactory <b>angiographic</b> result proceeded to uneventful coronary bypass surgery. There were no other procedural or in-hospital complications. One patient developed restenosis and one had an intra-cerebral bleed following a fall. This new stent thus appears safe and effective when used to treat threatened abrupt closure. Due to its favourable characteristics, it may be well suited for reduction of restenosis.

40|$|ObjectiveAvoidance of nephrotoxic {{contrast}} agents during endovascular {{repair of}} abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR) {{may reduce the}} incidence of renal dysfunction following the procedure. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) angiography is a safe alternative to iodinated contrast media vastly under-utilized by vascular surgeons. We herein describe our experience with <b>a</b> simple <b>angiographic</b> technique using CO 2 for EVAR guidance that does not require <b>a</b> separate <b>angiographic</b> catheter. MethodsEighteen patients underwent EVAR using angiography with CO 2 delivered through the endograft sheath. The renal and hypogastric arteries were localized for endograft deployment exclusively with CO 2 in all patients. Completion angiography was done with CO 2 in all patients and an additional angiogram with iodinated media was done in 13 cases. ResultsAll endograft deployments were done successfully with CO 2 angiography injected through the endograft delivery systems and femoral access sheaths. Additional iodinated media completion angiography did not modify the procedure in any case. All patients were discharged within two days after surgery. There were no ischemic or systemic complications related to CO 2 administration. Follow-up CT-scan revealed well positioned endografts with the expected patent renal and hypogastric arteries in all patients, and no additional endoleaks. No significant deterioration in renal function occurred in any case. ConclusionCarbon dioxide angiography conducted through the endograft delivery sheath is reliable for endograft deployment, safe, non-toxic and inexpensive. In addition, it may expedite EVAR by eliminating <b>a</b> number of <b>angiographic</b> catheter placements and exchanges during the procedure. This favorable experience warrants further utilization of this technique...|$|R
