40|$|The {{investigation}} {{objects are}} the silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide and indium phosphide. The {{aim is to}} investigate the impurity composition of the large-scale (up to 20 mu m) impurity <b>accumulations</b> and their recombination activity. The parameters of the <b>accumulations</b> (ionization energy of impurity centres forming the <b>accumulations,</b> concentration of <b>accumulations,</b> concentration of free carriers in them) have been determined. It has been showh that the impurity large-scale <b>accumulations</b> are the <b>accumulations</b> of the impurities ionized at T= 300 K. It has been determined that the small defects (equivalent to 2 mu m) are the accelerated recombination centres of the carriers.

It was set preliminary position of moraine <b>accumulations</b> according to maps of glacial relief, which were collected for studied area. Subsequently, moraine <b>accumulations</b> were precisely mapped in terrain and suitable locations were chosen for measuring of weathering characteristics. Schmidt-hammer measurement was used for determination of weathering degree of boulders located on moraine <b>accumulations.</b> Proportions of weathering pits and thickness of weathering rind were measured for supplementary data, which characterize state of boulder weathering. Acquired data of moraine <b>accumulations</b> were statistically evaluated using correlation analysis, ANOVA, and cluster analysis.

40|$|Cyanobacteria, {{primarily}} {{of the species}} Nodularia spumigena, form extensive surface <b>accumulations</b> in the Baltic Sea in July and August, ranging from diffuse flakes to dense surface scums. The area of these <b>accumulations</b> can reach 200 000 km 2. We describe the compilation of a 35 -year-long time series (1979 – 2013) of cyanobacteria surface <b>accumulations</b> in the Baltic Sea using multiple satellite sensors. This appears {{to be one of}} the longest satellite-based time series in biological oceanography. The satellite algorithm is based on remote sensing reflectance of the water in the red band, a measure of turbidity. Validation of the satellite algorithm using horizontal transects from a ship of opportunity showed the strongest relationship with phycocyanin fluorescence (an indicator of cyanobacteria), followed by turbidity and then by chlorophyll a fluorescence. The areal fraction with cyanobacteria <b>accumulations</b> (FCA) and the total accumulated area affected (TA) were used to characterize the intensity and extent of the <b>accumulations.</b> The fraction with cyanobacteria <b>accumulations</b> was calculated as the ratio of the number of detected <b>accumulations</b> to the number of cloud-free sea-surface views per pixel during the season (July–August). The total accumulated area affected was calculated by adding the area of pixels where <b>accumulations</b> were detected at least once during the season. The fraction with cyanobacteria <b>accumulations</b> and TA were correlated (R 2 = 0. 55) and both showed large interannual and decadal-scale variations.

50|$|Continuous-type <b>accumulations</b> include {{fractured}} shale and fractured chalk oil and gas, basin-centered gas, coal bed gas, {{and tight}} reservoir gas. They typically cover large areas, have source rocks in close association with these unconventional reservoir rocks, and are mostly gas (and {{in some cases}} oil) charged throughout their extent. Continuous <b>accumulations</b> commonly have transition zones that grade into more conventional <b>accumulations.</b>|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to continuous <b>accumulations,</b> discontinuous <b>accumulations</b> can also occur in source-rock reservoirs, if their permeabilities are high enough. This is relatively {{more common in}} CBM reservoirs because the permeability of coals is highly variable, ranging from less than 1 md to more than 1000  md. Generally, the permeability of low-ranked coals is higher and almost {{comparable to that of}} conventional reservoirs. Thus, <b>accumulations</b> in such permeable coals could often be governed by structural traps and more concentrated at high structural positions. The variation in the permeability of medium-ranked coals is also fairly large, and thereby both continuous and discontinuous <b>accumulations</b> are possible.|$|R

5|$|Methods for {{measuring}} retreat include staking terminus location, global positioning mapping, aerial mapping and laser altimetry. The key symptom of disequilibrium is thinning {{along the entire}} length of the glacier. This indicates a diminishment of the <b>accumulation</b> zone. The result is marginal recession of the <b>accumulation</b> zone margin, not just of the terminus. In effect, the glacier no longer has a consistent <b>accumulation</b> zone and without an <b>accumulation</b> zone cannot survive. For example, Easton Glacier in Washington state, U.S. will likely shrink to half its size but at a slowing rate of reduction and stabilize at that size despite the warmer temperature over a few decades. However, the Grinnell Glacier in Montana, U.S. will shrink at an increasing rate until it disappears. The difference is that the upper section of Easton Glacier remains healthy and snow-covered, while even the upper section of the Grinnell Glacier is bare, is melting and has thinned. Small glaciers with minimal altitude range are most likely to fall into disequilibrium with the climate.|$|E

40|$|Mass <b>accumulations</b> of belemnite rostra (‘belemnite battlefields’) {{are common}} in Mesozoic sediments, and <b>accumulations</b> of belemnoids are also known from older rocks.

A proposed model for the production of belemnite battlefields involves five possible pathways: post-spawning mortality, catastrophic mass mortality, predation concentration, stratigraphical condensation, and resedimentation. Although <b>accumulations</b> that have not been reworked are rare, it is possible to recognise the generating agents of belemnite <b>accumulations</b> through their intrinsic features.

As a result, such structural settings are more suitable for the occurrence and enrichment of extensive quasi-continuous oil and gas <b>accumulations.</b>|$|R
