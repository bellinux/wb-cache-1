Because of the small sample size, the data collected from three areas were combined together and analyzed as from one population. For the halibut data, age information was not recorded at banding, but an <b>age-length</b> <b>key</b> was available. The <b>age-length</b> <b>key</b> was used to form 8 size classes that approximately corresponded to I-year age classes. The structure of the tag recovery models is generally based on three types of parameters: the annual survival rates, the direct recovery rates (for newly tagged fish) and the indirect recovery rates (for previously tagged fish). We found that the indirect recovery rate estimates are {{much higher than the}} estimates ofdirect recovery rates, and that the annual survival rates of Pacific Halibut are high (at least greater than 50 % in general). According to the results of the model selection, the survival rates and indirect recovery rates are year dependent; the indirect recovery rate increases linearly with fish size; and there is no difference between the survival rates of size classes 5 to 8 which correspond to fish of"ages 10 to 13 + years...|$|E

Changes in the input data The 2007 NMFS summer bottom-trawl survey (BTS) abundance at age estimates were computed and included for this assessment. The NOAA ship R/V Oscar Dyson was diverted from planned survey research in the Gulf of Alaska this summer to add a mid-water echo-integration trawl (EIT) survey for the EBS. This was the first complete survey conducted by this vessel in this region. Age composition estimates were derived from the population-at-length estimates using the 2007 BTS <b>age-length</b> <b>key.</b> The 2006 age composition estimates were updated using EIT age data (last year the BTS <b>age-length</b> <b>key</b> was used).

40|$|A multinomial {{logistic}} model {{is presented as}} a tool for comparing two or more <b>age–length</b> <b>keys.</b> The model provides an objective way to fill in missing values and can be used for estimating uncertainty and visualizing <b>age–length</b> <b>keys</b> (ALKs). An example of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus L.) in ICES Division VIa (West of Scotland) is used to illustrate that significant regional differences in the proportions of age classes-at-length can exist on a small spatial scale. These differences are caused by regional variation in both length-at-age and relative abundance at age. As the length-at-age data are normally not weighted by the local catch rate (abundance), the ALK of the combined age data can result in strongly biased estimates of numbers-at-age. In the present case, the use of unweighted age data would have resulted in an overestimate of recruitment of nearly 200 % and an underestimate of spawning stock biomass of 15 %. Comparing ALKs using this method has several practical applications in fisheries science.

40|$|Abstract The {{basic data}} from several ICES coordinated trawl and beam trawl surveys in the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, the area west of Scotland and France {{are stored in}} the DATRAS {{database}} in the ICES Secretariat; every year and for each survey member countries report data to the database. The DATRAS system offers facilities for the calculation of fish stock abundance indices, these indices are fed into the routine fish stock assessment work. The indices should be supplemented by an estimate of their uncertainty and the present paper suggests a bootstrap algorithm for implementation in DATRAS to calculate such estimates of variation for each stock/area index in a given year. The procedure is a two-step bootstrap routine whereby the length compositions and <b>age-length</b> <b>key</b> are bootstrapped independently, i. e. the uncertainty estimate is based on variability between catches in individual hauls in that year.

Using 2010 to 2012 data improves length range and monthly sampling coverage. Variability in length at age from ALK seems acceptable and although it was developed from data pooled over three years, the bias {{is likely to be}} small. Final age was adjusted to account for the date of capture and the timing of bands formation throughout the year. Monthly formation of edge type, translucent or opaque, was inconclusive and did not allow establishing an annual formation pattern.

40|$|The {{indices of}} {{abundance}} at age estimated from trawl surveys {{are one of}} the main parameters in fisheries assessment, nevertheless these indices are associated with high variability due to the relatively scarce numbers of hauls performed during a survey given the high cost of sampling at sea.

The analysis considered age data from eight readers collected during an otolith-reading workshop. Four scenarios of age-estimation errors were assumed: Case 1 — a reference age computed as the modal age of estimates obtained by the four most experienced readers; Case 2 — age readings from a precise and experienced (Namibian) reader of horse mackerel otoliths; Case 3 — age estimates from a reader that displayed positive bias compared with the reference ages; and Case 4 — age estimates from a reader that displayed negative bias compared with the reference ages. The <b>age–length</b> <b>key</b> of each case was applied to length distributions of survey, pelagic fleet and midwater fleet landings (1991 – 2003) to obtain catch-at-age data.

We revised the method for estimating catch-at-age from the age-conversion table (ACT), which is a simple method for age determination, to <b>age-length</b> <b>keys</b> (ALK) calculated {{from the results of}} multiple length frequency analysis. Abundant year classes caught successively year after year could be more easily identified from the catch-at-age data computed using ALK than by using ACT. Our results suggested not only that the mean size of commercial landings fluctuated based on changes in age composition but also that a decrease in the length-at-age in the population influenced the consistent size decrease of commercial landings. 北海道西部日本海海域におけるホッコクアカエビの成長と年齢別漁獲尾数を推定するため，調査船標本にもとづく甲長組成解析を行い，年齢別サイズを調べた。解析結果から，成長の年変動と年齢別サイズの減少傾向が認められた。年齢別漁獲尾数の推定方法を，従来の甲長－年齢変換テーブル（ACT）から，age-length key（ALK）による方法に改良した。また，近年の漁獲物の小型化は，年齢組成の変動だけではなく，年齢別サイズの減少の影響を受けていることを明らかにした...|$|R
40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{presents the}} first results on abundance {{and distribution of}} white anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius) {{from a series of}} groundfish surveys carried out on the Porcupine Bank. White anglerfish were caught in all trawlable areas, recruits and juveniles mainly from the shallower parts of the bank, around the central mound and closer to the Irish shelf. A strong cohort was manifest in 2001, and it could be tracked over time by age matrices obtained with illicia <b>age–length</b> <b>keys</b> (ALKs) collected during the surveys. However, a mismatch in the cohort analysis suggests that the growth pattern based on illicia underestimates around three of the younger age classes. Using an ALK estimated numerically from a faster growth model, this mismatch disappears, which seems to confirm faster growth. Recruits of the 0 -group and adults of age 4 (with the faster growth: ca. 57 – 65 cm) dominated, whereas the intermediate age groups were scarce on the bank. These results and recent findings from tag-and-recapture experiments suggest that white anglerfish move to and from the Porcupine Bank, calling into question the stock boundaries currently accepted for the species in the North Atlantic...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} three {{demersal}} species dominant in biomass and abundance in the Weddell Sea, Chionodraco myersi (channichthyid), Trematomus eulepidotus (nototheniid) and Dolloidraco longedorsalis (artedidraconid), was studied on specimens caught in summer. Ages were determined using ground and polished otolith sections and an {{image analysis system}} to measure the otolith radius and distances of each growth increment to the otolith core. Ageing precision and accuracy have been estimated. Indirect validation methods, based on the increment growth pattern, were applied to support the annual periodicity of the increments. Due {{to the lack of}} some age classes, back-calculated <b>age-length</b> <b>keys</b> were determined and used to fit the von Bertalanffy growth parameters by sex and species. The determined values showed sexual dimorphism, with females having faster growth rates, except in D. longedorsalis. The growth performance index was between 1 and 2, as in other high-Antarctic fish. For T. eulepidotus, age and growth data were available, {{but this is the first}} report for C. myersi and D. longedorsalis. Moreover, this is the first time that accuracy and precision have been estimated for high-Antarctic fish age determination. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
