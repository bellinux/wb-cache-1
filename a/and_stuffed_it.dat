5|$|The mob lit garbage on fire <b>and</b> <b>stuffed</b> <b>it</b> {{through the}} broken windows {{as the police}} grabbed a fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, the hose was {{ineffective}} in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by plywood by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. The Village Voice writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar <b>and</b> <b>stuffed</b> <b>it</b> in his pants, unsure if {{he might have to}} use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt lighter fluid into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45minutes.|$|E
60|$|Whistling Dick {{folded the}} {{stocking}} carefully, <b>and</b> <b>stuffed</b> <b>it</b> into his pocket.|$|E
60|$|Albert {{finished}} untying {{the sheet}} from the bedpost, <b>and</b> <b>stuffed</b> <b>it</b> under the pillow.|$|E
50|$|Prepare {{the dough}} in yogurt, mixing it {{thoroughly}} {{until it becomes}} very smooth, <b>and</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>it</b> with minced meat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite {{sufficient}} for any decent woman," [...] retorted the contractor. [...] "When Clemmy wants painting <b>and</b> <b>stuffing,</b> <b>it</b> {{will be time}} {{enough for her to}} think about getting one of your 'Ach Himmels' or 'Mon Dieus'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To-morrow is Christmas," [...] she said, [...] "and {{we shall}} have an {{abundance}} with which to celebrate the good day. So I shall make you a Christmas pie, Jack dear, <b>and</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>it</b> full of plums, for you must have your share of our unexpected prosperity." ...|$|R
60|$|Miss De Ormond {{picked up}} the cheek carelessly, folded it indifferently, <b>and</b> <b>stuffed</b> <b>it</b> into her glove.|$|E
60|$|Harcutt {{produced}} a handkerchief <b>and</b> <b>stuffed</b> <b>it</b> to his mouth; {{his face was}} slowly becoming purple with suppressed laughter. Mr. Blatherwick ordered the champagne.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, only I don't {{believe he}} did it! It was that nasty little Bill Nosey. I am sure that he got hold of the lady's parcel, <b>and</b> <b>stuffed</b> <b>it</b> into Silky's cap." ...|$|E
50|$|The site, {{outside the}} city {{boundaries}} {{in the village of}} Riverview, provides a view of the Gateway Arch. “In the afternoon, when the sun shines on the city, you get this nice reflection. You don’t see all the trash <b>and</b> <b>stuff.</b> <b>It’s</b> the best view of the city,” Cassilly said.|$|R
5000|$|The song [...] "Shine" [...] {{was adopted}} by Ansett Airlines for their final {{advertising}} campaign before the company went bankrupt and had to shut down. “I jinxed them with my song!" [...] Amorosi said. [...] "That was heartbreaking, actually. We had some little goodbye parties <b>and</b> <b>stuff.</b> <b>It</b> was horrible.” ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We're not {{actually}} in it," [...] Goffey explains. [...] "It's all really old footage of religious preachers {{mixed in with}} old footage {{of rock and roll}} audiences, and what's interesting is they react in the same way. They both go into these convulsions and pull their hair out <b>and</b> <b>stuff.</b> <b>It's</b> quite mad." ...|$|R
60|$|Before {{he thought}} {{what he was}} doing the Elephant's Child put out his trunk and plucked a large bundle of grass, dusted it clean against his fore-legs, <b>and</b> <b>stuffed</b> <b>it</b> into his own mouth.|$|E
60|$|Once, {{six years}} after Joscelyn had left Spring Valley, Cyrus, who was reading a paper by the table, got up with an angry exclamation <b>and</b> <b>stuffed</b> <b>it</b> into the stove, thumping the lid on over it with grim malignity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Easy {{enough in}} appearance," [...] was Mrs Bowater's comment, as she folded up this stained and flimsy letter again, <b>and</b> <b>stuffed</b> <b>it</b> into her purse, [...] "but it's past even Mr Bowater to control {{what can be}} read between the lines." ...|$|E
5000|$|Daechu-cho (...) - made by deseeding jujube, {{steaming}} {{it for a}} {{short time}} <b>and</b> <b>stuffing</b> <b>it</b> with around two pine nuts, simmering the stuffed jujube with honey and cinnamon powder, and coating it with pine nut powder. When served, daechu-cho is garnished with a toasted pine nut on the stalk end of the jujube.|$|R
50|$|In 1969 Jansen {{created the}} Soft Tea Set, a scaled to life, photographic, {{three-dimensional}} object using a formula of potassium ferrocyanide and citric acid, which she developed specifically for cloth material. Stitching the imaged fabric together <b>and</b> <b>stuffing</b> <b>it,</b> {{she was the}} first to use this photographic process in a sculptural format.|$|R
5000|$|In a radio {{interview}} on Vancouver Island's CKWV-FM ("The Wave"), Gessle shared information about The Rox Box. [...] "It's four CDs, a DVD, {{a little bit}} of this, {{a little bit of}} that, outtakes <b>and</b> demos <b>and</b> <b>stuff.</b> <b>It's</b> like a coffee table thing, and it's really, really big an 80-page booklet and stuff." ...|$|R
60|$|Young Rockwall {{took the}} ring reverently and tried {{it on his}} {{smallest}} finger. It slipped {{as far as the}} second joint and stopped. He took it off <b>and</b> <b>stuffed</b> <b>it</b> into his vest pocket, after the manner of man. And then he 'phoned for his cab.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She was {{so proud}} of it, Maude. Gave {{eighteen}} shillings for it, and covered <b>and</b> <b>stuffed</b> <b>it</b> herself. And that, I suppose, is THE screen. She was a great housekeeper--brought up a spoiled child, according to her own account, but a great housekeeper all the same. What's that writing in the case?' ...|$|E
60|$|Laurie {{threw back}} his head, and laughed so heartily at this attack, that the felt hat fell off, and Jo walked on it, which insult only afforded him an {{opportunity}} for expatiating on the advantages of a rough-and-ready costume, as he folded up the maltreated hat, <b>and</b> <b>stuffed</b> <b>it</b> into his pocket.|$|E
60|$|There he {{dismounted}} {{and left}} his horse standing with the bridle reins dragging upon the ground, while he removed the lariat from the pommel of the saddle, <b>and,</b> <b>stuffing</b> <b>it</b> inside his shirt, {{walked back to the}} street on which the building stood, and so made his way past the sentry and to his room.|$|R
50|$|A big benefit party {{takes place}} at the school, with food sold in {{combination}} boxes. Again Roger teases Shockey about his father. Just as Shockey is about to punch Roger again, Elvira restrains his fist. Shockey comes up with a slightly less violent way to react to Roger, grabbing a handful of ice cubes by a punch bowl <b>and</b> <b>stuffing</b> <b>it</b> down the back of his shirt.|$|R
60|$|He spent a final forenoon in {{polishing}} {{his article}} up, <b>and</b> <b>stuffing</b> <b>it</b> full of telling points. But after dinner on this last day he took leave of Marcia with more trepidation {{than he was}} willing to show, or knew how to conceal. Her devout faith in his success seemed to unnerve him, and he begged her not to believe in it so much.|$|R
6000|$|Not until {{many years}} after this did [...] "ostrich-farming" [...] and feather-exporting become, as it still continues, {{one of the most}} {{important}} branches of commercial enterprise in the Cape Colony; but we cannot avoid the conclusion, that, as Watt gave the first impulse to the steam-engine when he sat and watched the boiling kettle, so Mrs Marais opened the door to a great colonial industry when she held that infant ostrich between her knees, <b>and</b> <b>stuffed</b> <b>it</b> with minced eggs and liver.|$|E
60|$|Taking off {{his right}} shoe {{he placed the}} Blue Pearl within it, far up in the pointed toe. Then he tore a piece from his {{handkerchief}} <b>and</b> <b>stuffed</b> <b>it</b> into the shoe to hold the pearl in place. Inga's shoes were long and pointed, as were all the shoes worn in Pingaree, and the points curled upward, {{so that there was}} quite a vacant space beyond the place where the boy's toes reached when the shoe was upon his foot.|$|E
60|$|As Bridge {{unwrapped}} {{the package}} {{and the paper}} unfolded beneath his eyes an article caught his attention--just casually at first; but presently {{to the exclusion of}} all else. As he read his eyebrows alternated between a position of considerable elevation to that of a deep frown. Occasionally he nodded knowingly. Finally he glanced up at Billy who was just rising from his ablutions. Hastily Bridge tore from the paper the article that had attracted his interest, folded it, <b>and</b> <b>stuffed</b> <b>it</b> into one of his pockets--he had not had time to finish the reading and he wanted to save the article for a later opportunity for careful perusal.|$|E
6000|$|... "So we will, and be jolly {{till the}} blunderbuss gets back. Camp down, girls, and you fellows, come {{and hold the}} lantern while I get wood <b>and</b> <b>stuff.</b> <b>It</b> is so confoundedly dark, I shall break my neck down the shed steps." [...] And Mark {{led the way to}} the library, where the carpet still remained, and {{comfortable}} chairs and sofas invited the chilly visitors to rest.|$|R
50|$|Mugwort rice cakes, or kusa mochi {{are used}} for Japanese sweets called Daifuku (which {{literally}} translated means 'great luck'). To make these, take {{a small amount of}} mochi <b>and</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>it</b> or wrap it round a filling of fruit or sweetened azuki (red bean) paste. Traditional Daifuku can be pale green, white or pale pink and are covered in a fine layer of potato starch to prevent sticking.|$|R
5000|$|A Bolivar Peninsula woman {{quoted in}} the Houston Chronicle in 2005 said [...] "There's a lot of drugs and drinking. In the summer time at the Fourth of July <b>and</b> <b>stuff,</b> <b>it's</b> bad." [...] She {{said that she would}} like to see the county sheriff add patrols on the Bolivar Peninsula but she argued that the area to patrol would be too big and so the county cannot control the crime.|$|R
60|$|Now, not {{far from}} where he lived, and beside the river, stood a willow-tree, and thither the lucky beggar took his purse of money <b>and</b> <b>stuffed</b> <b>it</b> into a knot-hole of a {{withered}} branch, then went his way, certain that nobody would think of looking for money in such a hiding-place. Then {{all the rest of the}} day he sat thinking and thinking of the ways he would spend what had been given him, and what he would do to get the most good out of it. At last came evening, and his brother, who had been begging in another part of the town, came home again.|$|E
6000|$|He {{appeared}} {{to be on the}} point of entering the room, when he checked himself as if he had suddenly remembered something. [...] "Wait a minute," [...] he said, through the door, and, turning away, went straight to the end room. [...] "If there is anybody watching us in there," [...] he said aloud, [...] "let him watch us through this!" [...] He took out his handkerchief, <b>and</b> <b>stuffed</b> <b>it</b> into the wires of the grating, so as completely to close the aperture. Having thus forced the spy inside (if there was one) either to betray himself by moving the handkerchief, or to remain blinded to all view of what might happen next, Midwinter presented himself in Allan's room.|$|E
60|$|Tess, {{being left}} alone with the younger children, went first to the {{outhouse}} with the fortune-telling book, <b>and</b> <b>stuffed</b> <b>it</b> into the thatch. A curious fetishistic fear of this grimy volume {{on the part of}} her mother prevented her ever allowing it to stay in the house all night, and hither it was brought back whenever it had been consulted. Between the mother, with her fast-perishing lumber of superstitions, folk-lore, dialect, and orally transmitted ballads, and the daughter, with her trained National teachings and Standard knowledge under an infinitely Revised Code, there was a gap of two hundred years as ordinarily understood. When they were together the Jacobean and the Victorian ages were juxtaposed.|$|E
6000|$|... "An insult!" [...] she answered, {{crushing}} {{the paper in}} her hand <b>and</b> then <b>stuffing</b> <b>it</b> {{into the pocket of}} her dress. [...] "Light your pipe, daddy, dear. Here--I'll strike the match." ...|$|R
