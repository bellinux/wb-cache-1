25|$|To do this, the FidoNet <b>addressing</b> <b>scheme</b> was {{extended}} {{with the addition}} of a final address segment, the point number. For instance, a user on the example system above might be given point number 10, and thus could be sent mail at the address 1:170/918.10.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} {{towards the}} net/node <b>addressing</b> <b>scheme</b> was also useful for reducing communications costs between continents, where timezone differences on {{either end of}} the connection might also come into play. For instance, the best time to forward mail in the US was at night, but that might not be the best time for European hosts to exchange. Efforts towards introducing a continental level to the addressing system started in 1986.|$|E

25|$|Flash drives {{implement}} the USB mass storage device class so that most modern operating systems can {{read and write}} to them without installing device drivers. The flash drives present a simple block-structured logical unit to the host operating system, hiding the individual complex implementation details of the various underlying flash memory devices.

25|$|At {{a meeting}} held in Kaplan's {{living room in}} St. Louis on 11 April 1985 the various parties {{hammered}} {{out all of the}} details of the new concept. As part of this meeting, they also added the concept of a region, a purely administrative level that {{was not part of the}} <b>addressing</b> <b>scheme.</b> Regional hosts would handle any stragglers in the network maps, remote systems that had no local network hosts. They then divided up the US into ten regions that they felt would have roughly equal populations.|$|E
25|$|The gross {{capacity}} of older HDDs is calculated {{as the product}} of the number of cylinders per recording zone, the number of bytes per sector (most commonly 512), and the count of zones of the drive. Some modern SATA drives also report cylinder-head-sector (CHS) capacities, but these are not physical parameters because the reported values are constrained by historic operating system interfaces. The C/H/S scheme has been replaced by logical block addressing (LBA), a simple linear <b>addressing</b> <b>scheme</b> that locates blocks by an integer index, which starts at LBA 0 for the first block and increments thereafter. When using the C/H/S method to describe modern large drives, the number of heads is often set to 64, although a typical hard disk drive, , has between one and four platters.|$|E
50|$|Ethernet is a {{connectionless}} technology. It {{does not}} have a routing mechanism and its <b>address</b> <b>scheme</b> is based on 48-bit MAC addresses. However, its flat <b>address</b> <b>scheme</b> results in a potential explosion of forwarding database entries and an uncontrolled flooding of broadcast messages throughout the network. In order to overcome Ethernet’s scalability issues, a partitioning scheme, named VLAN, was introduced.|$|R
50|$|Devices must support Ethernet’s MAC addressing, {{plus the}} Sercos III <b>addressing.</b> Other <b>addressing</b> <b>schemes</b> are optional.|$|R

2500|$|PCI {{provides}} separate {{memory and}} I/O port address spaces for the x86 processor family, 64 and 32 bits, respectively. [...] Addresses in these address spaces are assigned by software.

The proposed deflection routing algorithm can be implemented all-optically using bitwise optical logic gates. Besides the primary output link selection, alternate output link choices by a packet at each node in case of deflection are also encoded in the address header.
