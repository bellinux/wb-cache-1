Tentative incisions <b>accompany</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of suicides by sharp force and the absence of hesitation marks provokes questions about the manner of death. We present the bizarre fatality of a 41 -year-old male with an isolated circumscribed incision on the right neck, where the body was found lying in a pool of blood in the shower of his apartment. The internal examination revealed a 4 -cm-long channel-like defect running inwardly and downwardly along the right sternocleidomastoid region. The cause of death was external bleeding from an injured right carotid artery and internal jugular vein. The wound had clean non-contused margins without any conspicuous hesitation injuries. A fragment of a razor blade, found in blood splatters, was identified as the only potential injuring tool. The case was classified as a suicide...|$|E

40|$|Lymphatic filarial {{nematodes}} {{are able}} to down-regulate parasite-specific and nonspecific responses of lymphocytes and APC. Lymphatic filariae are reliant on Wolbachia endosymbiotic bacteria for development and survival. We tested the hypothesis that repeated exposure to Wolbachia endosymbionts would drive macrophage tolerance in vitro and in vivo. We pre-exposed murine peritoneal-elicited macrophages to soluble extracts of Brugia malayi female worms (BMFE) before restimulating with BMFE or TLR agonists. BMFE tolerized macrophages (in terms of IFN-beta, IL- 1 beta, IL- 6, IL- 12 p 40, and TNF-alpha inflammatory cytokine production) in a dose-dependent manner toward self, LPS, MyD 88 -dependent TLR 2 or TLR 9 ligands (peptidoglycan, triacyl lipopeptide, CpG DNA) and the MyD 88 -independent/TRIF-dependent TLR 3 ligand, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid. This was accompanied with down-regulation in surface expression of TLR 4 and up-regulation of CD 14, CD 40, and TLR 2. BMFE tolerance extended to CD 40 activation in vitro and systemic inflammation following lethal challenge in an in vivo model of endotoxin shock. The mechanism of BMFE-mediated macrophage tolerance was dependent on MyD 88 and TLR 2 but not TLR 4. Evidence that desensitization was driven by Wolbachia-specific ligands was determined by use of extracts from Wolbachia-depleted B. malayi, aposymbiotic filarial species, and a cell line stably infected with Wolbachia pipientis. Our data promote a role for Wolbachia in contributing toward the dysregulated and tolerized immunological phenotype that <b>accompanies</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of human filarial infections...|$|R

40|$|Using a naturalistic video database, we {{examined}} whether gestures scaffolded the symbolic {{development of a}} language-enculturated chimpanzee, a language-enculturated bonobo, and a human child during {{the second year of}} life. These three species constitute a complete clade: species possessing a common immediate ancestor. A basic finding was the functional and formal similarity of many gestures between chimpanzee, bonobo, and human child. The child’s symbols were spoken words; the apes’ symbols were lexigrams, noniconic visual signifiers. A developmental pattern in which gestural representation of a referent preceded symbolic representation of the same referent appeared in all three species (but was statistically significant only for the child). Nonetheless, across species, the ratio of symbol to gesture increased significantly with age. But even though their symbol production increased, the apes continued to communicate more frequently by gesture than by symbol. In contrast, by 15 - 18 months of age, the child used symbols more frequently than gestures. This ontogenetic sequence from gesture to symbol, present across the clade but more pronounced in child than ape, provides support for the role of gesture in language evolution. In all three species, <b>the</b> overwhelming <b>majority</b> of gestures were communicative (paired with eye-contact, vocalization, and/or persistence). However, vocalization was rare for <b>the</b> apes, but <b>accompanied</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of <b>the</b> child’s communicative gestures. This finding suggests the co-evolution of speech and gesture after the evolutionary divergence of the hominid line. Multimodal expressions of communicative intent (e. g., vocalization plus persistence) were normative for the child, but less common for the apes. This finding suggests that multimodal expression of communicative intent was also strengthened after hominids diverged from apes...|$|R

40|$|We have {{operated}} on nine patients suffering from benign or malignant tumours in the thoracic {{portion of the}} trachea. The main clinical symptom was difficulty in breathing, <b>accompanied</b> in <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of cases by attacks of asphyxia, cough with mucous phlegm, and haemoptysis. The following operations were performed: circular resection of the trachea with end-to-end anastomosis, thoracic tracheotomy with enucleation of the tumour, fenestral resection with auto-alloplasty of the ensuing defect, piecemeal removal of the tumour through the lumen of the trachea, and intrathoracic tracheotomy with biopsy of the tumour. All patients were discharged after the operation. When giving an anaesthetic during an operation on the thoracic portion of the trachea it is expedient to introduce a tube into the left main bronchus from the right pleural cavity and to exclude the right lung from ventilation.

40|$|Phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -biphosphate (PIP 2) {{has been}} implicated {{in a variety of}} {{cellular}} processes, including synaptic vesicle recycling. However, {{little is known about the}} spatial distribution of this phospholipid in neurons and its dynamics. In this study, we have focused on these questions by transiently expressing the phospholipase C (PLC) -δ 1 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) in cultured hippocampal neurons. This PH domain binds specifically and with high affinity to PIP 2. Live confocal imaging revealed that in resting cells, PH-GFP is localized predominantly on the plasma membrane. Interestingly, no association of PH-GFP with synaptic vesicles in quiescent neurons was observed, indicating the absence of detectable PIP 2 on mature synaptic vesicles. Electrical stimulation of hippocampal neurons resulted in a decrease of the PH-GFP signal at the plasma membrane, most probably due to a PLC-mediated hydrolysis of PIP 2. This was <b>accompanied</b> in <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of presynaptic terminals by a marked increase in the cytoplasmic PH-GFP signal, localized most probably on freshly endocytosed membranes. Further investigation revealed that the increase in PH-GFP signal was dependent on the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and the consequent production of nitric oxide (NO). Thus, PIP 2 in the presynaptic terminal appears to be regulated by postsynaptic activity via a retrograde action of NO...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — As {{the yearly}} {{electric}} energy demand grows, {{there is a}} significant increase in the penetration of distributed generation (DG) to fulfil this increase in demand. Interconnecting DG to an existing distribution system provides various benefits to several entities. DG provides an enhanced power quality, higher reliability of the distribution system and can peak shaves and fill valleys. However, the integration of DG into existing networks has associated several technical, economical and regulatory questions. Distribution system design and planning are key features for determining the best expansion strategies to provide reliable and economic services to the customer. Transfer of electric energy from the source of generation to the customer via the transmission and distribution networks is <b>accompanied</b> by losses. <b>The</b> <b>majority</b> of these losses occur on the distribution system. Placement of distributed generators on the distribution system can lead to a reduction in power losses. Reduction of I 2 R losses in distribution system is very essential to improve the overall efficiency of power delivery...|$|R
