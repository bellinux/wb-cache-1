40|$|Background. Contemporary {{clinical}} {{assessments of}} activity are needed across the age span {{for children with}} cerebral palsy (CP). Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) {{has the potential to}} efficiently administer items for children across wide age spans and functional levels. Objective. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the psychometric proper-ties of a new item bank and simulated computerized adaptive test to assess activity level abilities in children with CP. Design. This was a cross-sectional item calibration study. Methods. The convenience sample consisted of 308 children and youth with CP, aged 2 to 20 years (X 10. 7, SD 4. 0), recruited from 4 pediatric hospitals. We collected parent-report data on an initial set of 45 activity items. Using an Item Response Theory (IRT) approach, we compared estimated scores from the <b>activity</b> <b>item</b> bank with concurrent instruments, examined discriminate validity, and devel-oped computer simulations of a CAT algorithm with multiple stop rules to evaluate scale coverage, score agreement with CAT algorithms, and discriminant and concur...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP) is {{a patient}} {{generated}} outcome instrument applicable {{in the evaluation}} of both allopathic and complementary medicine treatment. This study aims to adapt MYMOP into Chinese, and to assess its validity, responsiveness and minimally important change values in a sample of patients using Chinese medicine (CM) services. Methods A Chinese version of MYMOP (CMYMOP) is developed by forward-backward-forward translation strategy, expert panel assessment and pilot testing amongst patients. 272 patients aged 18 or above with subjective symptoms in the past 2 weeks were recruited at a CM clinic, and were invited to complete a set of questionnaire containing CMYMOP and SF- 36. Follow ups were performed at 2 nd and 4 th week after consultation, using the same set of questionnaire plus a global rating of change question. Criterion validity of CMYMOP was assessed by its correlation with SF- 36 at baseline, and responsiveness was evaluated by calculating the Cohen effect size (ES) of change at two follow ups. Minimally important difference (MID) values were estimated via anchor based method, while minimally detectable difference (MDC) figures were calculated by distribution based method. Results Criterion validity of CMYMOP was demonstrated by negative correlation between CMYMOP Profile scores and all SF- 36 domain and summary scores at baseline. For responsiveness between baseline and 4 th week follow up, ES of CMYMOP Symptom 1, Activity and Profile reached the moderate change threshold (ES> 0. 5), while Symptom 2 and Wellbeing reached the weak change threshold (ES> 0. 2). None of the SF- 36 scores reached the moderate change threshold, implying CMYMOP's stronger responsiveness in CM setting. At 2 nd week follow up, MID values for Symptom 1, Symptom 2, Wellbeing and Profile items were 0. 894, 0. 580, 0. 263 and 0. 516 respectively. For <b>Activity</b> <b>item,</b> MDC figure of 0. 808 was adopted to estimate MID. Conclusions The findings support the validity and responsiveness of CMYMOP for capturing patient centred clinical changes within 2 weeks in a CM clinical setting. Further researches are warranted (1) to estimate <b>Activity</b> <b>item</b> MID, (2) to assess the test-retest reliability of CMYMOP, and (3) to perform further MID evaluation using multiple, item specific anchor questions. </p...|$|E
40|$|The conference {{divided the}} {{presentation}} into two parts: presentation & Q/A {{in the morning}} and collaboration discussion in the afternoon. There are couple of questions and discussions: 1. 	How do we design and develop cross-platform mobile application? I explain how we apply multi-agent system design principle into the proposed research and the responsibility that each agent is in charge. 2. 	Why use multi-agent concept to develop this mobile educational game? The multi-agent system doesn’t require many resources as ordinary application does due to not all agents have to be started and loaded at the very beginning. 3. 	How to avoid the inaccuracy of GPS positioning methodology? The proposed research use two agents to deal with positioning task, one is Position Locator and another is Learning <b>Activity</b> <b>Item</b> Collector. The Position Locator get GPS packet and decode it in order to get user’s current location and it can work with Learning <b>Activity</b> <b>Item</b> Collector by scanning and decoding QR codes to get precise position of the user. The two agents can work together when the user is at indoor situation, which means, there is no GPS signal available. This research is part of Dr. Kinshuk’s iCORE project on personalization and adaptivity in informatics, this research is going to add two more agents for providing the user personalized and immersive service. The two agents are Configurator and Storyteller. Also, from the discussions I made with participants in the workshop, I found that the less resource consuming is not the only benefit that the multi-agent based mobile educational game has. Tan and Kinshuk (2009) argue that there are five design principlesThis presentation will report the research findings of the Alberta-North/Athabasca University research project, entitled “Attracting, Preparing, and Retaining Aboriginal and Low-Literacy Learners in Northern Communities”. The findings were gathered from several sources, including community consultations, learner survey results, and a review of the literature, all of which begin to suggest persistent themes, strategies, and necessities for attracting, preparing and retaining students in northern communities.

A sample of children with autism was compared to a normative sample. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of PEDI-CAT data from an autism sample (n= 356) and a normative sample (n= 2, 205). Children (ages 3 - 21) were classified into one of six age groups. Crosstabs were conducted to determine the age group when 50 % of parents in each sample reported that a Daily <b>Activity</b> <b>item</b> was "easy" and when 50 % reported their child took "most responsibility" for a corresponding Responsibility item. Visual analysis examined differences in these two points. Results: Parents of children and youth with autism reported that the majority of Daily Activities were "easy" at a later age group compared to the normative sample. "Most responsibility" also was reached a later age group in the ASD sample or not reached at all. Conclusion: For children and youth with and without autism, there is an age gap between when relevant skills are mastered and when they take responsibility for managing the overall task...|$|E

Participant feedback received during round 2 further informed item reduction based on {{selection of the}} most appropriately worded item alternates. An additional item, daytime sleep, was removed as results could prove difficult to interpret because sleeping either more or less could represent an increase in RSV severity and increased sleep would already be captured within the <b>activity</b> <b>item</b> (i.e., no activity), and decreased sleep could also correlate with mood (e.g., increased fussiness). Because this item {{did not seem to}} provide additional evaluative information but rather would introduce noise into the overall measure, it was deleted from {{the final version of the}} GRCD. Further wording revisions were made to response options associated with three items (sleep, disposition, and activity) to mirror the direction of the other scales and to maintain consistency across the wording in the response scales included in the final version. This wording tested well across similar response options reviewed during the two rounds of testing, which provide further support for the small modification. Finally, while the item assessing fever tested well and was deemed important, participants noted potential value of applying a range of values based on actual temperature for those using a thermometer to monitor fever.|$|E

In this paper, we identify the usefulness of suggesting activity partners together with items in recommender systems.

METHODS: Twenty-three patients from two university hospitals and two regional hospitals who had been treated with oxaliplatin were included through purposive sampling between autumn 2013 to autumn 2014. A test-retest was performed through a mobile phone-based system, with a recall period of 1 h to determine the reliability of the questionnaire. RESULTS: Internal consistency was strong for the three domains of the scale (α > 0. 840). The statistical analyses for the test-retest indicated that the OANQ was stable. Intraclass correlation (ICC) for symptom items and effect on daily <b>activities</b> <b>items</b> showed an overall excellent reproducibility at 69 and 83 %, respectively. The weighted kappa for symptom <b>items</b> and daily <b>activities</b> <b>items</b> showed an overall almost perfect agreement at 59 and 52 %, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{spite of}} a {{well-established}} development of instruments, difficulty in interpreting health related quality of life scores may limit its use in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To develop generalizable interpretation aids for a measure of perceived functional visual status, the VF- 14 index. DESIGN: Item Response Theory (Rasch analysis) was {{used to analyze the}} performance of VF- 14 items. The 'ruler' aid was derived from the most difficult <b>activity</b> (<b>item)</b> a patient is able to do without difficulty; the 'clinical scenarios' aid, first identified all significantly different clusters of items within the index and then estimated the mean expected difficulty (responses) to perform a benchmark item in each cluster. SETTING: The study was conducted in four hospitals and six ambulatory cataract surgery centers in Barcelona, Spain. PATIENTS: One hundred and ninety-eight patients scheduled for first eye cataracts surgery. MEASUREMENTS: The self-reported VF- 14 index and clinical measures were used. RESULTS: All VF- 14 items were found unidimensional with three items showing only partial misfit. For a patient with a VF- 14 Rasch score of 71, the 'ruler' aid indicated that 'doing fine handwork' would be the most requiring activity he/she would perform without difficulty. The 'clinical scenarios' aid estimated that such a patient would be unable to 'drive at night', would have some difficulty 'reading small print' and no difficulty 'doing fine handwork', 'watching TV' or 'recognizing people'. Concordance between modeled and observed responses was fair to substantial. CONCLUSIONS: Simple content-based interpretation aids for the VF- 14 scores were developed that should facilitate its use in clinical practice. These aids should be easily generalizable to other quality of life instruments...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIntroductionWhether {{rotator cuff}} repair is {{indicated}} in an elderly subject depends on the patient's activity profile and functional demand. A Senior Shoulder Activity (SSA) score is described, as a support for indications and analysis of clinical results according to activity level. Material and methodThe SSA score, comprising 4 levels from “sedentary” to “very active”, was validated by comparison against a control group of 113 asymptomatic patients. It {{was included in the}} protocol of the French Arthroscopy Society's comparative study of repair versus simple decompression in 143 rotator cuff tears. Recovery of activity was assessed according to procedure. ResultsAt 1 -year follow-up, suturing was associated with recovery of previous activity level in 87 % of the cases and in 80 % for decompression, a non-significant difference. When, however, less active patients (SSA 1 and 2) were contrasted with the more active (SSA 3 and 4), clinical results with suture versus decompression on Constant score showed a greater difference in the SSA 3 – 4 group. DiscussionThe SSA score {{is not the same as}} the <b>activity</b> <b>item</b> of the Constant score, as it assesses the patient's usual activity level, before symptom onset, whereas the Constant item assesses activity at a given moment, independently of the patient's normal activity profile. ConclusionThe Senior Shoulder Activity score is a simple, reproducible complement to the Constant score, revealing differences in clinical results on the latter, according to activity profile. Rotator cuff repair or simple decompression provided recovery of previous SSA activity level in more than 80 % of the cases. The difference in clinical results between the two was significantly greater in more active patients. It would seem to follow that suture is more beneficial for more active subjects while simple decompression may be suitable for those with lower functional demand.

40|$|Social media, {{regarded}} as two-layer networks consisting of users and items, {{turn out to}} be the most important channels for access to massive information in the era of Web 2. 0. The dynamics of human <b>activity</b> and <b>item</b> popularity is a crucial issue in social media networks. In this paper, by analyzing the growth of user <b>activity</b> and <b>item</b> popularity in four empirical social media networks, i. e., Amazon, Flickr, Delicious and Wikipedia, it is found that cross links between users and items are more likely to be created by active users and to be acquired by popular <b>items,</b> where user <b>activity</b> and <b>item</b> popularity are measured by the number of cross links associated with users and items. This indicates that users generally trace popular items, overall. However, it is found that the inactive users more severely trace popular items than the active users. Inspired by empirical analysis, we propose an evolving model for such networks, in which the evolution is driven only by two-step random walk. Numerical experiments verified that the model can qualitatively reproduce the distributions of user <b>activity</b> and <b>item</b> popularity observed in empirical networks. These results might shed light on the understandings of micro dynamics of activity and popularity in social media networks. Comment: 13 pages, 6 figures, 2 table...|$|R

Item reduction was conducted by using a panel of physiotherapists and patients. Objectives The overall study objectives were: 1) To determine if a functional outcome measurement scale for trauma inpatients exists and has been published; 2) To generate functional items for the construction of a new outcome measurement tool for trauma inpatients; 3) To construct a new outcome measurement tool for trauma inpatients and assess elements of validity and reliability (face and content validity, response to change, internal consistency and floor and ceiling effects) of the new developed outcome measure. Methodology Convenience sampling was applied to collect data from 35 trauma inpatients in trauma wards at Rashid Hospital in Dubai, UAE. 88 % of the trauma inpatients were male (total sample n= 100), mean age = 34. 75, and the standard deviation = 14. 46. 21 functional <b>activity</b> <b>items</b> were generated from the collated results of the patient interviews. Internal consistency reliability, responsiveness and floor and ceiling effect were assessed. Data analysis was conducted using Statistica Version 7. Results The final number of functional <b>activity</b> <b>items</b> included in the newly developed Functional Scale outcome measure was 29 <b>activity</b> <b>items</b> relevant for trauma inpatients. A Cronbach's alpha ranged between 0. 76 and 0. 97. The lowest alpha result was for the 'ADL' activities at follow-up (0. 76). The highest alpha result was for 'out of bed' activity at admission and discharge (0. 97). The response to change of the Functional Scale for trauma inpatients over time results illustrates that there was a significant difference in the mean scores over three administrations of 'Bed', 'Out of bed' and 'ADL' <b>activity</b> <b>items</b> of Functional Scale for trauma inpatients (p=O. OOOO). In general, there was no significant floor and ceiling effects at admission or discharge for 'bed', 'out of bed' and 'ADL' activities, except there was a floor effect noted at discharge for 'bed' activities and 'ADL' activities, and a ceiling effect noted at admission for 'out of bed activities' only. Discussion and Conclusion The newly developed Functional Scale outcome measurement for trauma inpatients has been shown to be internally consistent and appears to be valid with respect to response to change in this sample of trauma inpatients. The results of this study thus suggest that the Functional Scale for trauma inpatients may be an appropriate tool when the goal is the assessment of change in disability functions in trauma inpatients, although further psychometric testing may be required...|$|R

40|$|Play Participation Measures for Children Aged Eight to Eleven Years: A Systematic Review Background For {{occupational}} therapists, {{the primary}} aim of therapy is to enhance a child 2 ̆ 7 s participation in meaningful occupations, The primary occupation for children is play. Participation in play facilitates social, cognitive {{emotional and physical}} development. The {{growing body of evidence}} highlighting the importance of play has seen an emergence of measures designed to assess a child 2 ̆ 7 s play. Past and current measures vary in the aspects of play measured. The purpose of this systematic review was to appraise play participation measures appropriate for {{children between the ages of}} five and eleven that exist within the literature, and to identify the similarities and differences inherent in their structures and psychometric properties. Methods Electronic searches of four databases and manual searches of reference lists located studies detailing the development and psychometric properties of play measures: Assessments that exclusively measured play participation and conjunctively measured environmental factors were included. Data extraction was undertaken by two independent reviewers. Results Electronic searches yielded 536 papers. Results of the systematic review identified ten generic measures of play participation suitable for children between the ages of five and eleven. All measures varied in their focus and purpose, targeted population, measurement context, applicability to ICF-CY play domains, and reliability and validity properties. Conclusions and Significance of the Study Occupational therapists require clinical reasoning skills to systematically appraise available measures of play participation. Evaluation will ensure selected measures meet the assessment needs and needs of the child, facilitating accurate assessment and the subsequent result of client centred therapy and effective service provision. Contextual Factors Influence Childhood Paliicipation: The need for a Paediatric Activity Card Sort - Australia Background The Paediatric Activity Card Sort (P ACS) is a measure of childhood participation and was developed and validated with children living in North America. Contextual differences present limitations in the sensitivity of <b>activity</b> <b>items</b> when applied to Australian children. The purpose of this study was to identify activities common to the participation profiles of children residing in metropolitan Perth, Western Australia for potential inclusion in the <b>activity</b> <b>items</b> ofthe PACS-Australia. Methods The study comprised a cross sectional survey. Activities for potential inclusion in the PACS Australia were sourced from administration of the PACS and a semi-structured interview with typically developing children aged 8 - 11 years residing in metropolitan Petth, Western Australia. Results Forty one children (22 girls and 19 boys) with an age range of 8 - 11. 9 years completed the survey. Mean participation scores for the domains of personal care, school/productivity, hobbies/social activities and sports were 10. 39, 12. 29, 28. 17 and 4. 59, respectively. Group differences were found in relation to gender for personal care (girls mean rank= 24. 27, boys mean rank= 17. 21,p= 0. 036) and sports participation (girls mean rank= 14. 2, boys mean rank= 28. 87,p= 0. 000). Seventy four 2 ̆ 7 activities not included in the PACS were also listed. Conclusions and Significance of the Study <b>Activity</b> <b>items</b> were not found to be comprehensive with a number of common Australian childhood activities absent. Further, several PACS activities were not found to be common among Australian children. The P ACS is a valuable tool however, when applied to Australian children, is limited by a lack of comprehensive, contextually relevant <b>activity</b> <b>items,</b> highlighting the need for a P ACS-Australia...|$|R
