5|$|On 22 January 1967 Bukovsky, Vadim Delaunay, Yevgeny Kushev and Victor Khaustov held another {{demonstration}} on Pushkin Square. They were protesting {{against the}} recent arrests of Alexander Ginzburg, Yuri Galanskov, Alexei Dobrovolsky and Vera Lashkova (finally prosecuted in January 1968 in the Trial of the Four) and asserting {{their own right}} to protest: on 16 September 1966 a new law, Article 190.3, had been introduced which classified any public gatherings or demonstrations <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{protector}} of Gotham City and the Caped Crusader. Bruce struggles with his dual identity <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> fighter, becoming romantically involved with Selina Kyle, alias Catwoman. Keaton earned $11 million for reprising {{his role as}} the Caped Crusader as director Tim Burton thought that Keaton deserved it. Batman Returns was Keaton's final film as Batman, as he was subsequently replaced by Val Kilmer and George Clooney in Batman Forever and Batman & Robin respectively.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of publication, Vachss worked as an attorney, in New York City, specializing in child abuse cases; {{he also had a}} career as a novelist. The duality of Vachss' work as a lawyer prosecuting and {{defending}} real cases and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> fiction author writing about fictional criminals resulted in Vachss being compared to the Bruce Wayne/Batman character. Vachss' eighth novel, Footsteps of the Hawk, in the Burke series featuring a vigilante private investigator of child abuse cases, was released just two months before the publication of Batman: The Ultimate Evil. He had wanted to approach the topic of sex tourism in southeast Asia, but had been unable to find a way for the Burke character to go there; the Batman character offered the chance for him to write about the topic.|$|E

5|$|Priestley also {{defended the}} rights of Dissenters against the attacks of William Blackstone, an eminent legal theorist, whose Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765–69) had become the {{standard}} legal guide. Blackstone's book stated that dissent from the Church of England was a crime and that Dissenters could not be loyal subjects. Furious, Priestley lashed out with his Remarks on Dr. Blackstone's Commentaries (1769), correcting Blackstone's interpretation of the law, his grammar (a highly politicised subject at the time), and history. Blackstone, chastened, altered subsequent editions of his Commentaries: he rephrased the offending passages and removed the sections claiming that Dissenters could not be loyal subjects, but he retained his description of Dissent <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Arabian Peninsula {{was largely}} arid and volcanic, making {{agriculture}} difficult except near oases or springs. The landscape was dotted with towns and cities; {{two of the}} most prominent being Mecca and Medina. Medina was a large flourishing agricultural settlement, while Mecca was an important financial center for many surrounding tribes. Communal life was essential for survival in the desert conditions, supporting indigenous tribes against the harsh environment and lifestyle. Tribal affiliation, whether based on kinship or alliances, was an important source of social cohesion. Indigenous Arabs were either nomadic or sedentary, the former constantly travelling {{from one place to another}} seeking water and pasture for their flocks, while the latter settled and focused on trade and agriculture. Nomadic survival also depended on raiding caravans or oases; nomads did not view this <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecutor}} {{alleges that}} murder <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> against humanity {{took place in}} Nakuru and Naivasha. He alleges that approximately 112 {{people were killed in}} Nakuru between 24 and 27 January 2008 and that by 31 January at least 50 people had been killed in Naivasha. One witness testified that 23 people died in Naivasha from burns including 19 who died in a single arson attack on the Kabati estate. The majority of the killings were the result of attacks with machetes and blunt instruments although guns were used in some attacks.|$|E

5|$|When Rao Gari Illu {{was nearly}} completed, Varma asked co-director Siva Nageswara Rao to join him. He {{approached}} Tanikella Bharani {{to write the}} dialogue after observing his work in Ladies Tailor (1985) and Shri Kanakamalaxmi Recording Dance Troupe (1987). Bharani found the plot (as described by Varma) {{similar to those of}} K. S. R. Das' films. Varma rejected Bharani's comic version, and asked to rewrite it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> drama. Although Bharani's usual fee was 25,000, he received 35,000 for Siva. Gunasekhar and Teja, who later pursued career as filmmakers, joined the film's crew as assistant directors.|$|E
5|$|Batman: The Ultimate Evil {{is a novel}} {{written by}} Andrew Vachss and {{published}} in 1995 by the Warner Aspect imprint of Warner Books. Vachss was an attorney specializing in child abuse cases, as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> novelist {{best known for his}} series of books featuring the character Burke, a private investigator who also takes on child abuse cases. A representative from DC Comics approached Vachss about the possibility of writing a novel featuring Batman. Viewing {{this as an opportunity to}} reach a completely different audience, Vachss agreed and wrote a draft. He continued with his themes concerning child sexual abuse and explored the topic of child sex tourism. The publisher required Vachss to follow certain rules, like making a clear distinction between fiction and reality and prohibiting the Batman character from killing, cursing, or having sex.|$|E
5|$|The {{charge of}} murder <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> against {{humanity}} {{was made by}} the prosecutor in relation to multiple attacks {{that took place in the}} aftermath of the election. The prosecution alleges that members of the network attacked Turbo town on 30 and 31 December 2007, resulting in at least 4 deaths and with one witness claiming that he saw more than 200 dead bodies. Additionally the prosecutor alleges that network members attacked the Huruma, Kiambaa, Kimumu, Langas and Yamumbi areas of Eldoret, resulting in 70 to 87 deaths. It is alleged that during the attack in Kaimbaa several people took refuge in a church which was locked from outside and then burned down causing between 17 and 35 people to be burned to death. Additionally the prosecutor alleges that the towns of Kapsabet and Nandi Hills town were attacked by network members.|$|E
50|$|In a New York State trial courtroom, the Brooklyn Supreme Court (located in Brooklyn, NY), jury {{selection}} started on September 10, 2007 {{for the trial}} of Anthony Fortunato and John Fox, {{two of the four}} men accused of chasing Michael Sandy to his death in October 2006. They were charged with two counts of second-degree murder, one <b>as</b> <b>a</b> hate <b>crime,</b> four counts of attempted robbery with two as hate crimes, two manslaughter counts, one <b>as</b> <b>a</b> hate <b>crime,</b> and two assault counts, one <b>as</b> <b>a</b> hate <b>crime.</b> The third man, Ilya Shurov, was to be tried separately at a future date on the same charges.

5|$|In 1976, the Dunstan Government {{stepped up}} its {{legislative}} efforts. Some bills, {{such as the one}} to remove the sodomy law and decriminalise male homosexuality, had been initially blocked by the Legislative Council. However, the bill to abolish capital punishment passed with ease, and the homosexuality law reforms eventually passed in September. Rape law was properly codified and defined <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> within marriage {{for the first time in}} Australia. Shopping hours, previously the most restrictive in the nation, became the most open. Following a royal commission, Friday night shopping was introduced for the city and Thursday night shopping for the suburbs. The deposits on beverage containers was finally passed. The first signs of Monarto's eventual failure began to appear: birth rates started dropping significantly, immigration slowed and the economy was stagnant. South Australia's robust population growth, previously the highest per capita among the states, came to an abrupt halt. However, state money continued to be poured into the Monarto project, despite the fact that the Whitlam government cut funding to $600,000 in 1975, while his Liberal successor Malcolm Fraser gave nothing at all the following year. However, by the time Monarto was eventually scrapped after Dunstan's departure, no less than $20 million had been used to buy land, plant trees and formulate development plans, and the failed project is often seen as Dunstan's greatest failure. In addition, the federal government removed subsidies for shipbuilding at Whyalla, forcing the operations to be scaled down.|$|E
