5|$|Articles 87 through 89 of the Constitution {{deal with}} how the {{presidency}} can change hands in-between election cycles. The President {{has the ability to}} resign from office at any time under Article 87. The letter of resignation is sent to the House of Representatives and is accepted by them. The President has the ability to be removed from office if his physical or mental health is impaired under Article 88. In order for this to happen, a two-thirds majority must be reached in the House of Representatives and the Council of the Republic on the resolution to remove the President. An <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>committee</b> is formed and must make the determination about the state of health before any motion can begin. If the President has committed a grave crime, such as treason, one-third of the House must bring charges against the President formally. The investigation of the charges will be conducted by the Council of the Republic. In order to evict the President from office, a two-thirds majority is needed to vote in favor of conviction. The criminal case is further sent to the Supreme Court for review. The actions of either option must occur one month after the resolution is passed or the action will be considered void by the Constitution.|$|E

40|$|ANNULMENT OF AWARDS UNDER THE WASHINGTON CONVENTION ON SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES The {{annulment}} mechanism plays {{a significant}} role in the system established by the Washington Convention. As a model of review, it strives to reconcile respect for the parties' desire to achieve final and efficient resolution of their dispute with the limited possibility to quash an award which is a product of a fundamentally flawed process. The existence of this exceptional opportunity to annul an award after its issuance has been widely recognized as an important factor in the success of ICSID as a platform for settlement of investment disputes. This thesis focuses on the issue of scope of review exercised by the <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>committees</b> in annulment proceedings. The very first generation of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>committees,</b> represented by the annulment decisions in Amco I and Klöckner I, cast a shadow of doubt on ICSID's ability to transform its avowed dedication to the principle of finality into practice. Both of these decisions were accused of crossing the line between limited review anticipated by the Convention and substantive review typical for appellate systems. The primary ambition of this thesis is to explore the legitimacy of these concerns with respect to the current generation of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>committees.</b> Therefore, the first [...] ...|$|R
