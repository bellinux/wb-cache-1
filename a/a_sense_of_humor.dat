5|$|Johnson {{explored}} {{the theme of}} escapism at the Indianapolis Museum of Contemporary Art in a show entitled The Production of Escapism: A Solo Project by Rashid Johnson. He addressed distraction and relief from reality through art and fantasy. Johnson used photos, video and site-specific installation to study escapist tendencies through often with <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> that bordered on the absurd.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a career}} high in {{appearances}} in 2004, Rivera did not throw during the offseason, unlike previous years. His 2005 season began {{on a low}} note. After missing time in spring training with elbow bursitis, he blew his first two save opportunities of the season against the Red Sox, marking four consecutive blown opportunities against Boston {{dating back to the}} previous postseason. Fans at Yankee Stadium booed Rivera, and baseball journalists speculated if his days as a dominant pitcher were over. He was subsequently cheered by Red Sox fans during pre-game introductions at Fenway Park the following week, in recognition of his struggles against the Red Sox. He responded to the ovation with <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> by tipping his cap to the crowd.|$|E
5|$|No {{drawings}} or {{paintings of}} Sherwood exist, but contemporary accounts describe her as attractive and tall and possessing <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor.</b> Sherwood wore trousers {{instead of a}} dress while working on her farm. This was unusual for the time, as was her herb growing. The combination of clothing and good looks was said to attract men and upset their wives. Sherwood biographer and advocate Belinda Nash suggests that Sherwood's neighbors may have been jealous of Sherwood, and that the witchcraft tales may have been conjured up {{in an effort to}} remove her from, and subsequently get, her property. Sherwood was a party to at least a dozen lawsuits, in which she had to defend against accusations of witchcraft, or in which she sued her accusers for slander.|$|E

25|$|But {{he was not}} a dour man: he was sociable and had <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> {{from when}} he was a child—his mother {{mentions}} the occasional “crazy gaiety” of the young Joseph—until his old age, when he wrote a ditty in which the moon (la lune, feminine in French) scolds the indelicacy of the scientists trying to take pictures of her derrière (meaning both ‘far side’ and ‘backside’).|$|E
25|$|In Western European terms, Spybuck's style {{might be}} called naïve art, but his works differs from most naïve artists' due to the {{influence}} of ethnographic patronage that guided his choice to include certain details and an infusion of <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> and personality. His scenes can provide subtle hints of attitudes and personalities of individual people and often include whimsical details on the periphery that contrast with the central activities.|$|E

25|$|United States Special Envoy for the Korean Peace Talks, Charles Kartman, who was {{involved}} in the 2000 Madeleine Albright summit with Kim, characterised Kim as a reasonable man in negotiations, to the point, but with <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> and personally attentive to the people he was hosting. However, psychological evaluations conclude that Kim Jong-il's antisocial features, such as his fearlessness in the face of sanctions and punishment, served to make negotiations extraordinarily difficult.|$|E
25|$|Marilla Cuthbert: Matthew's sister, {{she is an}} austere but fair {{woman who}} objects to Anne's imaginative, unusual conduct {{on the grounds of}} its being part of the same group of {{behavioral}} misconducts that bring about dereliction of responsibility or produce a disrespectful personal image. Life experience with Anne, however, profoundly affects Marilla's ways; in a very early instance, she experiences first-hand how worthless a confession under duress could be. Although conservative and austere, she is fond of Anne and has the glimmerings of <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rodríguez shot {{action and}} horror short films on video and edited on two VCRs. In late 1990, his entry {{in a local}} film contest earned him {{a spot in the}} university's film program. There he made the award-winning 16mm short Bedhead (1991). The film chronicles the amusing misadventures of a young girl whose older brother sports an {{incredibly}} tangled mess of hair which she detests. Even at this early stage, Rodríguez's trademark style began to emerge: quick cuts, intense zooms, and fast camera movements deployed with <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor.</b>|$|E

25|$|Meredith Starr met Meher Baba in Toka, India on 30 June 1928. In 1931 Starr {{established}} a retreat center at East Challacombe, North Devon (a {{couple of miles}} from Combe Martin), where he invited Meher Baba to come and meet westerners. It was at the Devon retreat that many of Meher Baba's lasting followers from Europe and the United States first met Baba. Meredith was famously lacking in <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> and had a particular sense of how spiritual conduct should be, thus enforcing strong codes of serious contemplative conduct that made even Meher Baba uncomfortable. Yet he is considered to have {{played a central role}} in introducing Meher Baba to the western world.|$|E

500|$|The film's [...] "fish out of water" [...] {{comedy and}} acting were mostly lauded. The Courier Mail {{wrote that the}} film was funnier than its predecessors, and while not [...] "flippant", <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> was {{revealed}} {{through the efforts of}} the cast, writers and director. Newsweeks David Ansen considered The Voyage Home not only the most light-hearted of the movie franchise, but the most true in spirit to the original television series. A more negative review was offered by Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail, who wrote that under Nimoy's [...] "choppy" [...] direction {{there was a lack of}} comic timing paired with feeble humor.|$|E
500|$|During the {{broadcast}} run of The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., TV Guide featured a positive {{review of the}} show in its Couch Critic column and wrote, [...] "It's as funny as it is exciting, which {{is not an easy}} combo to pull off... it's fresh and funny and different, and that's why we like it." [...] The magazine twice listed Brisco as a family-friendly TV program: [...] "Back when some of us grew up, Westerns were synonymous with great family entertainment, but– let's be honest– some of them were dull as dust. Not this one. Brisco is a Western with <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> filled with impish action for kids and adults." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Jim (John Krasinski) {{arrives at}} work wearing a tuxedo in {{response}} to a memo written by Dwight (Rainn Wilson), about [...] "professionalism in the workplace". This leads to an awkward first encounter with Charles as Jim has to explain why he wore a tuxedo. This does not amuse Charles, who seems to lack <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor.</b> Jim's activity throughout the day is scrutinized by Charles, more so when Charles notes Jim's idea of a [...] "two-way petting zoo" [...] for Michael's party. When Jim tries to smooth things over with Charles, Charles condescends to Jim, questioning the necessity of Jim's position as Assistant Regional Manager, referring to it as made-up. When Charles leaves, Jim tries to say goodbye, with no response. Jim jokes that his career could be over.|$|E
