6000|$|... "Not entirely, sir," [...] Mr. Cullen admitted. [...] "At {{the same}} time--" [...] He paused <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> {{steadily}} for a moment, {{as though in}} search of inspiration.|$|E
6000|$|One {{afternoon}} Sarah shivered in her elegant hall bedroom; [...] "house heated; scrupulously clean; conveniences; {{seen to be}} appreciated." [...] She had no work to {{do except}} Schulenberg's menu cards. Sarah sat in her squeaky willow rocker, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> The calendar on the wall kept crying to her: [...] "Springtime is here, Sarah--springtime is here, I tell you. Look at me, Sarah, my figures show it. You've got a neat figure yourself, Sarah--a--nice springtime figure--why do you {{look out the window}} so sadly?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Milligan’s 19 Battery 56th Heavy Rgt. R.A. {{has arrived}} in Algeria. With his rank of gunner, {{there is no}} one under his command; his {{promotion}} later in the book is the source of comment. An officer, Lt. Budden says: [...] "Bombardier?" [...] He turned <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> [...] "Oh, dear." ...|$|E
60|$|Take your Johnson, <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{adjective}} Scurvy, in its {{higher or}} figurative sense.|$|R
500|$|Lady {{playing a}} lute <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window 1935–1936 (unsold, {{on display at}} the Rijksmuseum.) ...|$|R
60|$|Rufus {{walked to}} <b>the</b> window, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> {{objections}} to Mr. Farnaby appeared to fail, so far, in interesting him.|$|R
40|$|Now the cab {{was leaving}} the {{downtown}} area and was entering the residential district. I sat forward in my seat <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> Apparently {{this was not a}} fashionable neighborhood, but middle class and decaying. I had never been there before and looked at the big, dirty frame houses, old, stone churches with dead ivy clinging to them, and maples, bare of their leaves and dripping in the rain...|$|E
40|$|I {{was in a}} late {{afternoon}} lecture on the backside 2 nd floor of Classic Hall with Dr. Haq. We all heard an unusual noice outside (yes, it did sound like a train), so we got up <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> only to see a horribly dark sky and trees bending and breaking in two. As we turned {{to run out of}} the room, the glass from the windows flew out and hit us (Nancy C. Barbain ' 75). "Use of this image is restricted to projects related to Destination Indiana. IHS may not reproduce. Destination Indiana Hanover College Surviving Natural Disaster...|$|E
60|$|He {{climbed up}} the stairs and <b>the</b> ladders again <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> little window in the belfry. Then he {{examined}} his map of Europe.|$|R
6000|$|I dragged myself {{trembling}} to {{the window}} of <b>the</b> cottage <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> moon was glittering across the bay {{and there was no}} sound anywhere on the island.' ...|$|R
60|$|Reist {{pulled the}} window softly down <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> train was passing across a high bridge. Below, the river wound {{its way through}} a stretch of rocky, broken country.|$|R
6000|$|Wildeve opened <b>the</b> door <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> {{night was}} warm and cloudy. [...] "By Gad! 'tis dark," [...] he continued. [...] "But I suppose we shall find our way." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{little girl}} went to <b>the</b> window <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> air {{was filled with}} falling white flakes, so large in size and so queer in form that she was puzzled.|$|R
60|$|All the {{passengers}} turned by one accord <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> file of Chinamen under observation had indeed turned, {{and was even}} then moving rapidly away at right angles from the road.|$|R
60|$|Paul went to <b>the</b> {{bay window}} <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> {{ash-tree}} stood monstrous and black {{in front of}} the wide darkness. It was a faintly luminous night. Paul went back to his mother.|$|R
60|$|Rupert went to <b>the</b> window <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> {{night was}} dark, {{and the oil}} lamps had all been extinguished; {{but it seemed to}} him that a {{confused}} mass filled the place in which the house stood.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{was a young}} man," [...] Penelope struck in, [...] "I would {{belong to}} twenty clubs, if I could find them and I would hang around them all, <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window till I dropped." ...|$|R
60|$|Left to himself, Jake again {{went to the}} window, {{which was}} a small cottage one, opening inwards like a door. He opened it <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> {{sentinel}} instantly raised his carbine and ordered him to shut it.|$|R
60|$|He went to <b>the</b> window <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> fog {{which had}} lasted {{well into the}} evening, had {{vanished}} now, and the clear night was bright with stars. A distant murmur of traffic came {{from the direction of}} Piccadilly.|$|R
60|$|No one was there. William threw <b>the</b> window up <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> wind {{rushed into}} the room, {{together}} {{with the sound of}} distant wheels, footsteps hurrying along the pavement, and the cries of sirens hooting down the river.|$|R
50|$|The video {{starts with}} Stürmer {{lying in a}} chalk-lined bed. Shots of her and her band {{performing}} as shown. Stürmer is then shown at an outside café. Throughout the video, shots of Stürmer singing <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window are shown.|$|R
6000|$|The {{lady said}} [...] "Indeed!" [...] yawned, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> cabin window, <b>and</b> finally repeated, for a finale, the remark {{with which she}} had begun,--"After all, I think they are better off {{than they would be}} to be free." ...|$|R
60|$|Obviously {{the window}} was his only chance. He went to it <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> depth was too much, he knew, for even his strong bones to stand the shock; and the {{sentinel}} paced to and fro underneath with loaded carbine.|$|R
60|$|We both listened. A {{confused}} roar in the distance; it {{resembled the}} raging {{of the sea}} very far away. I opened <b>the</b> window <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> roar became louder, louder, and at last we discovered {{that it was the}} sound of many voices.|$|R
60|$|Harry gave a great shout, {{and then}} another, and another, and {{presently}} a negro woman came <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> cabin <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> over <b>the</b> creek. Then three colored children came tumbling <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> they <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> over <b>the</b> creek.|$|R
60|$|Then Cheditafa crept forward <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> great waves <b>and</b> {{the roaring}} water were gone. There was no water to be seen, except the brook which always ran {{at the bottom}} of the ravine, and which now seemed not very much bigger than it had been that morning.|$|R
60|$|Miss Drewitt, {{checking}} a sharp retort, {{returned to}} <b>the</b> door <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> patch of blue increased in size; the rain ceased {{and the sun}} came out; birds exchanged congratulations from every tree. The girl, gathering up her wet skirts, walked to the gate, leaving her companion to follow.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Collins <b>looked</b> up <b>and</b> grunted <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window again.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design team}} is {{impartial}} <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> for <b>the</b> {{interests of the}} owner.|$|R
60|$|Hodder {{sipped his}} coffee, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> at <b>the</b> morning-glories {{opening to the}} sun.|$|R
60|$|Steps into veranda <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> across <b>the</b> hills into sunset. The CAPTAIN follows.|$|R
60|$|He averted {{his face}} <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> window. His big jaw quivered.|$|R
60|$|Lord Belpher wandered moodily to <b>the</b> window <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> into <b>the</b> {{gathering}} darkness.|$|R
60|$|Lodloe made no answer; {{his mind}} did not {{comprehend}} the situation; {{he went to}} <b>the</b> window <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> man {{was standing on the}} sharp ridge of a roof which stretched from the tower to the rear portion of the building. By reaching upward he was able to look into the window.|$|R
60|$|She {{sat down}} with her back towards Mr. Carter <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> at <b>the</b> window.|$|R
50|$|Above the {{decision}} height, the pilot uses mostly the aircraft displays. Below decision height, the pilot must look outside to identify visual references. In this stage the pilot alternates between <b>looking</b> at displays <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> window. This switching {{can be avoided}} if a HUD is installed to display information to the pilot while also <b>looking</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
