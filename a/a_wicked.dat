5|$|It is an unseasonably hot Easter at church, {{and no one}} is {{interested}} in Reverend Lovejoy's sermons. When the collection plate is passed around, Homer puts in a chocolate Easter bunny that he found in the dumpster, enraging Reverend Lovejoy, calling it <b>a</b> <b>wicked</b> idol, and provoking him to read the Bible from the beginning. The Simpsons all fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|The title Django Unchained {{alludes to}} the titles of the 1966 Corbucci film Django; Hercules Unchained, the American title for the 1959 Italian epic fantasy film Ercole e la regina di Lidia, about the mythical hero's escape from {{enslavement}} to <b>a</b> <b>wicked</b> master; and to Angel Unchained, the 1970 American biker film about a biker exacting revenge on {{a large group of}} rednecks.|$|E
5|$|The wolf is {{likened to}} <b>a</b> <b>wicked</b> man who oppresses others. The fox is likened to the devil. The farmer is likened to the godly man, {{with whom the}} fiend finds fault. The woods where the wolf was cheated are corrupting goods that man longs to get. The cheese {{represents}} covetousness; the well that contains it is fraud and fantasy, which draws men downwards into hell.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) {{tries to help}} Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{understand}} how diabetes affects him after Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell) told Tracy that he is at risk of getting diabetes. Kenneth tells him a story of how <b>a</b> <b>wicked</b> witch will come and take him away {{if he continues to}} consume his unhealthy eating habits but Tracy does not believe him. Tracy gets disgusted when Kenneth tries to scare him by dressing as a witch but suddenly Jenna comes running in screaming and looking like a witch complete with a broomstick in hand. This scares both Kenneth and Tracy who fearfully vows to change his eating habits immediately.|$|E
5|$|The {{queen of}} Ujjain is keen for her {{daughter}} Indumathi (alias Indu) to marry her brother Surasena, a timid and mentally unstable person. When the gardener's son 'Thota' Ramudu beats Surasena at a concert for irritating the common people, he is summoned by the king to the court. His boldness leaves a considerable impression, but when Ramudu declares his love for Indu a day before his death sentence for meeting Indu secretly, the king is reminded of the astrologers' prediction that only a brave man can save her from <b>a</b> <b>wicked</b> sorcerer. He then challenges Ramudu to amass wealth {{equal to that of}} his to marry Indu, to which Ramudu agrees. He is released from prison.|$|E
5|$|Director Jewison can put {{his cards}} on the table, let his camera cut suspensefully to the players' intent faces, but a pool shark sinking a tricky shot into a side pocket {{undoubtedly}} offers more range. Kid also has a less compelling subplot. Away from the table, McQueen gambles on a blonde (Tuesday Weld) and on the integrity of his dealer pal, Karl Malden. Pressure comes from a conventionally vicious Southern gentleman (Rip Torn), whose pleasures include a Negro mistress, a pistol range adjacent to his parlor, and fixed card games. As Malden's wife, Ann-Margret spells trouble of another kind, though her naive impersonation of <b>a</b> <b>wicked,</b> wicked woman recalls the era when the femme fatale wore breastplates lashed together with spider web. By the time all the bets are in, Cincinnati Kid appears to hold a losing hand.|$|E

25|$|Yet another belief {{was that}} the fairies were demons entirely. This belief became much more popular {{with the growth of}} Puritanism. The hobgoblin, once a {{friendly}} household spirit, became <b>a</b> <b>wicked</b> goblin. Dealing with fairies was in some cases considered a form of witchcraft and punished as such in this era. Disassociating himself from such evils may be why Oberon, in A Midsummer Night's Dream, carefully observed that neither he nor his court feared the church bells.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Gremlin Graphics {{released}} a ZX Spectrum-only children's adventure game titled Tinderbox, of which all profit {{went to the}} Ethiopian famine relief fund through Soft Aid. In the game, written by Colin C. Chadburn, a wounded foot soldier named Tom must defeat <b>a</b> <b>wicked</b> witch and an evil king who together cruelly rule the country {{in order to save}} and marry the beautiful Princess Rowella. Tom does not kill the villains, instead he just scaries the witch-queen away and banishes the king.|$|E

The wicked uncle persuades Digory to follow her with a second magic ring that {{has the power to}} bring her back. This sets up the pair's adventures into other worlds, and they witness the creation of Narnia as described in The Magician's Nephew.|$|E

25|$|In Game 2, the Mets {{loaded the}} bases on a hit-by-pitch and two walks off of Shawn Estes when Timo Perez's two-run single {{put them up}} 2–0. The Giants cut it to 2–1 {{in the bottom of}} the inning when Jeff Kent hit a leadoff single and scored on Ellis Burks's double. Behind strong {{pitching}} from Al Leiter and a two-out two-run home run from Edgardo Alfonzo in the top of the ninth inning off of Felix Rodriguez, the Mets carried a 4–1 lead into the last of the ninth. However, following a double by Barry Bonds and a single from Jeff Kent, pinch hitter J. T. Snow hit a towering three-run home run off of Mets reliever Armando Benítez to tie the game at four. The Mets would bounce back in the tenth inning, with Rookie Jay Payton singling home Darryl Hamilton, who doubled with two outs, off of Rodriguez. The Giants would threaten again, and had the tying run on with two out and Bonds at the plate, but John Franco struck out Bonds looking on <b>a</b> <b>wicked</b> 3–2 changeup, giving the Mets a heart-stopping 5–4 victory and a 1–1 series moving to New York.|$|E
25|$|Fairy Rosebud {{enters the}} Abode of Demon Alcohol, who {{complains}} bitterly {{about the law}} that requires demons to speak in verse; and indeed he is very bad at it. Rosebud is depressed because the Fairy Queen has {{told her that her}} incompetence can no longer be tolerated; unless she becomes more attentive to her duties of protecting mortals from demons, she will be sent to the back row of the ballet chorus. She had decided to protect and assist Aloysius Parfitt, a clergyman, and Jane Collins, a nurse. Jane has attracted the attention of Sir Trevor Mauleverer, a colonel in the Life Guards, who Rosebud believes to be <b>a</b> <b>wicked</b> baronet. Rosebud asks the demon to carry Jane off to Sir Trevor's apartment (making it look as if Sir Trevor has had her carried off) so that Rosebud can then rescue Jane and restore her to Aloysius. The demon is attracted to Rosebud and agrees. However, Jane is really Lady Angela Wealdstone, a lady of fashion, in disguise, and Sir Trevor is really an honourable man. Nevertheless, Lady Angela has run away from home to avoid being forced by her father into an arranged marriage with Sir Trevor.|$|E
25|$|Abraham's {{personality}} and character {{is one of}} the most in-depth in the whole Quran, and Abraham is specifically mentioned as being a kind and compassionate man. Abraham's father is understood by Muslims to have been <b>a</b> <b>wicked,</b> ignorant and idolatrous man who ignored all of his son's advice. The relationship between Abraham and his father, who in the Quran is named Azar, is central to Abraham's story as Muslims understand it to establish a large part of Abraham's personality. The Quran mentions that Abraham's father threatened to stone his son to death if he did not cease in preaching to the people. Despite this, the Qur'an states that Abraham in his later years prayed to God to forgive the sins of all his descendants and his parents. Muslims have frequently cited Abraham's character as an example of how kind one must be towards people, and especially one's own parents. A similar example of Abraham's compassionate nature is demonstrated when Abraham began to pray for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah after hearing of God's plan through the angel Gabriel for them. Although the angel Gabriel told Abraham that God's plan was the final word, and therefore Abraham's prayers would be of no effect, the Quran nonetheless reinforces Abraham's kind nature through this particular event.|$|E
