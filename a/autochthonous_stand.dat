40|$|Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) {{occupies}} a larger natural range {{than any other}} species from the whole Pinaceae family, extending from Europe to the Far East (Manchuria) through Siberia. Because of such a wide geographic spreading, with very different environmental conditions, {{and because of the}} long evolutionary history of this pine, a large intraspecific variation is expected to occur. The aim of this research is to study the genetic diversity within populations and the genetic differentiation between populations representative of the Italian and of the remaining Eurasian natural range of Scots pine. Until now 8 Italian populations, 22 populations from the rest of Europe (9 of which are French) and 1 from Asia (Turkey), for a total of 31 natural populations, were studied by using isozymes as genetic markers, analysed through horizontal starch gel electrophoresis. The obtained results confirm the previously observed sharp and outstanding differentiation of an Italian population, located in the Emilian Apennine, which is the most differentiated population by far: it is a relict and isolated remnant from glacial and postglacial migrations, and it is even less similar to the studied Italian Alpine populations than the remaining foreign populations, which tend to group together with them. These new observations supply further evidence of the status of important genetic resource for this small and <b>autochthonous</b> <b>stand,</b> whose differentiation could depend both on its origin from a different glacial refugium and on a different evolutionary history due to its peripheral position with respect to the main range of this species, and whose values of genetic diversity parameters are similar to those found in the other Italian populations, in spite of its geographic isolation. On the basis of the obtained values of genetic distance, the seven Italian populations from the Alps tend to group together and appear rather differentiated from the remaining ones, suggesting both a different postglacial origin and a relative genetic isolation due to the Alpine barrier, but their cluster is close to a group of French populations, suggesting a common origin and a subsequent differentiation. Other French populations are scattered along the dendrogram. Some hypotheses on the postglacial recolonization routes followed by this species are also discussed. The results of this research are increasing the available knowledge on Scots pine, making it possible the drafting of more accurate programmes of genetic resource conservation...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) {{variation in}} 78 oak stands {{of an important}} forest complex (the Veluwe) in The Netherlands. Based on historical maps and information oak stands were classified as planted or autochthonous. A genetic study by means of cpDNA haplotype characterisation was carried out to describe (i) genetic diversity within and among stands; (ii) to investigate whether the stands originated from the same haplotypes; (iii) to relate haplotype distribution {{to the status of}} the stands. The planted stands were all polytypic, comprising a mixture of the four haplotypes that are common for The Netherlands. In addition, a fifth, non-autochtonous haplotype was detected in these stands. Of the putative <b>autochthonous</b> oak <b>stands</b> ca. 50 % were monotypic and in all stands only the four autochthonous haplotypes were detected. These stands also showed lower intra-population diversity (h(S) = 0. 259) than the planted stands (h(S) = 0. 610). Moreover, a significant positive correlation between genetic differentiation and geographic distance was observed among the <b>autochthonous</b> <b>stands,</b> while this spatial genetic structure was absent among the planted stands. This study indicates substantial human influence on the distribution of genetic diversity in oak stands across the Veluwe. The occurrence of a non-autochthonous haplotype in 25 % of the planted stands suggests long-distance seed transfer. In the remaining 75 % of the planted stands long-distance seed transfer cannot be proven. However, the high genetic diversity and lack of spatial genetic structure in the planted stands suggests the use of mixtures of (local) seed material of various origins. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|This study {{presents}} an alternative measurement protocol for assessing morphometric dimensions and morphological features of solifluction landforms. It utilizes remote sensing applications based on orthophotos and tools included allow measurements of various parameters. The same applications are utilized {{for developing a}} method for estimating geomorphic work of solifclution processes through postglacial times. The methods are implemented at six different locations in Southern Norway, with all representing distinctive climatic and environmental characteristics. The study finds the utilized applications useful and time-saving, although certain limitations are acknowledged and voiced. Morphometric results come out as complex and there is not possible to relate morphometric parameters to a precise description of solifluction landforms, or to relate parameter ratios to distinct morphology. However, some morphometric ratios (Riser Height:Tread Length) do come out as interesting, although more data is needed to confirm a firm connection. Block lobes in <b>autochthonous</b> blockfield <b>stand</b> out as much more regular in terms of morphology than the turf banked shapes, as well as representing larger morphometric dimensions. The localities with these features are also found to perform most geomorphic work. The geomorphic work is generally measured to be very high in this study, which highlights the role of solifluction as a denudational agent. </p...|$|R
40|$|Forest genetic {{resources}} are {{the aggregate of}} genofonds of native and cultivar populations of forest woody plants, valuable really or potential for specific territory (A brief dictionary… 2014). Forest {{genetic resources}} are studied in practice in most cases on example of forest-forming woody plants. It is necessary to consider of study of these resources in two positions: taxonomic and geographic. Forest forming coniferous species are studied best of all from the taxonomic point of view taking into account biodiversity. Genetic polymorphism is studied most in detail with such species as Pinus sylvestris, Pinus sibirica, Larix sibirica, Larix sukaczevii, Picea obovata, Abies sibirica. Populations of Larix gmelinii, Larix cajanderi, Picea ajanensis are studied considerable worse. Materials about genetic polymorphism of forest forming foliage species – representative of genera Betula and Populus are absent. Caryological polymorphism is studied sufficiently well in all Siberian conifer species. It should be noted especially attached to examination of this problem, that individuals with B-chromosome were discovered first by gymnosperms as an example Picea obovata. Discovery in Siberia of triploid asp deserve special attention. Geographic variability is shown most broadly in the investigations of Pinus sylvestris, Pinus sibirica, Larix sibirica. These investigations were conducted both in natural populations and in provenance trials. Such investigations of another conifer and foliage species either are shown by separate fragments or are absent at all Geographic variability is shown in a large measure in the operative forest seed sources regionalization. Numerous investigations directed {{to the analysis of}} morphological variability are conducted by all forest forming species in the first place by conifers. Questions of hereditary determination of either signs remain in this problem. Similar questions concern the variability of other signs: phonological peculiarities, resin productivity etc. It can be noted from the geographic point of view. General typical peculiarity for all species: best study of forest genetic resources in the south regions and worse study in the north regions. This fact concerns all species with the exception of Larix cajanderi, which does not grow in the south regions of Siberia. Noted regularity is explained simply of more difficult availability of forests in the north Siberian regions. Certainly the north forests are characterized as a general rule by bad productivity, but they have great ecological importance. Besides that, north forests are represented in most cases by <b>autochthonous</b> <b>stands</b> that raise value of their genetic resources. It is necessary to note too that investigations of species of woody plants near the north edge of their range (by south range edge, too) are {{an important component of the}} adaptive breeding of their species. It is necessary to take into account by analysis of Siberian forest genetic resources specifics of different types of woody plants populations: isolated insular populations outside the main areas, hybrid populations in the zones of natural intraspecific hybridization etc...|$|R
40|$|Types of ectomycorrhizae {{were studied}} in soil cores {{from a young}} {{regeneration}} center in an <b>autochthonous</b> Norway spruce <b>stand</b> on Pokljuka (Triglav National Park, 1200 m. a. s. l.). Soil cores of equal volume (274 ml, 0 - 18 cm deep) were taken from 33 sampling plots. In the samples all the roots were counted and types of ectomycorrhizae briefly characterized. From these data diversity indices (species diversity (d) and Shannon-Weaver index of diversity (H)) were calculated. Interactions among mycorrhizae, light regime and survival of spruce seedlings were studied. Out of about 50, 000 root tips approximately 1 % were non-mycorrhizal, 63 % were old unviable mycorrhizae and 36 % were identifiable ectomycorrhizal root tips, forming 27 different types of ectomycorrhizae. Sixteen types of ectomycorrhizae were briefly characterized. The Shannon diversity index for types of ectomycorrhizae was high (3. 13) {{with respect to the}} above-ground diversity of vegetation (1. 7). The direct site factor was shown to be negatively correlated to ~Piceirhiza cornuta. The diffuse site factor was negatively correlated to Cortinarius sp. (obtusus type) and positively correlated to Inocybe sp. The ground vegetation cover was positively correlated t...|$|R
40|$|The {{abundance}} {{and distribution of}} small mammals are important factors for ecosystem structure and functioning, often affected by spatial heterogeneity and seasonal fluctuations. In this study, we tested the influence of habitat type, landscape composition and meteorological conditions on small mammal {{abundance and}} richness in the heterogeneous coastal wetland landscape of Baixo Vouga Lagunar (BVL), NW Portugal. Seven different habitats (Bocage, a mosaic composed of small agricultural and pasture fields separated by live fences of <b>autochthonous</b> vegetation, eucalyptus <b>stands,</b> maize fields, marshlands, reed beds, rice fields and rushes) were sampled every 2 months, between November 2011 and October 2012, resulting in a trapping effort of 18, 665 trapnights. We recorded a total of 1961 captures, including 566 recaptures, of which 1714 (87. 4 %) were rodents and 247 (12. 6 %) were shrews. Spatially, reed beds presented the highest values of small mammal diversity and favoured this fauna abundance, as well as rushes and marshlands. In contrast, Bocage and eucalyptus stands did not favour most of the species abundance and richness; eucalyptus stands were the habitat with the lowest diversity. Overall, cumulative precipitation favoured the abundance of most species, determining small mammal seasonal fluctuations. At a fine scale, landscape heterogeneity {{did not seem to}} influence small mammal abundance and richness. At a broader scale, the landscape matrix appeared to favour small mammal richness and diversity, because species have heterogeneous distribution throughout the patchy landscape. Conservation and management efforts should therefore be focused on wetland natural habitats, considering the remaining habitat types that compose the matrix...|$|R
