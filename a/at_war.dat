5|$|After Genghis Khan's {{death in}} 1227, his empire was divided by his {{descendants}} into four sections or Khanates, which degenerated into civil war. The northwestern Kipchak Khanate, {{known as the}} Golden Horde, expanded towards Europe, primarily via Hungary and Poland, while its leaders simultaneously opposed the rule of their cousins back at the Mongol capital. The southwestern section, known as the Ilkhanate, was {{under the leadership of}} Genghis Khan's grandson Hulagu. He continued to support his brother, the Great Khan, and was therefore <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with the Golden Horde, {{while at the same time}} continuing an advance towards Persia and the Holy Land.|$|E

5|$|After {{the failure}} and {{disappearance}} of the Hospitallers, {{the history of the}} region is shrouded in obscurity for decades. But the trend toward the unification of the Romanian polities seems to begin with Voivode Litovoi. He (or his namesake son) was <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with the Hungarians and killed in battle sometime between 1270 and 1280. In the battle, his brother, Bărbat was captured. Bărbat was forced not only to pay ransom but also to recognize Hungarian rule.|$|E
5|$|Alexander had no {{experience}} in affairs of state. However, {{he was determined to}} make the best of a difficult situation and represent his father as best he could. Adopting an air of cool indifference to the government, he rarely made the effort to read official documents before he rubber-stamped them. His functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the Macedonian front to support the morale of the Greek and Allied troops. Since Venizelos's return to power, Athens was <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with the Central Powers, and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.|$|E
5|$|Bran Stark is {{learning}} how to be the Lord of Winterfell while his older brother is away <b>at</b> <b>war.</b> He has a strange dream, where he sees himself as Summer, his direwolf, running in the Godswood.

The pair notice a red comet in the sky; Bran remarks that the men claim it is an omen of victory for one side or another in the war, but Osha insists it means one thing: dragons have returned.|$|E

5|$|During the {{occupation}} of Norway, {{three members of the}} Norwegian Nobel Committee fled into exile. The remaining members escaped persecution from the Germans when the Nobel Foundation stated that the Committee building in Oslo was Swedish property. Thus it was a safe haven from the German military, which was not <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with Sweden. These members kept the work of the Committee going, but did not award any prizes. In 1944, the Nobel Foundation, together with the three members in exile, made sure that nominations were submitted for the Peace Prize and that the prize could be awarded once again.|$|E
5|$|Eddard Stark awakens in his {{chambers}} with Robert Baratheon and Cersei Lannister watching him. Cersei accuses Eddard {{of kidnapping}} her brother, Tyrion, and claims Eddard was drunk and attacked Jaime first, {{but she is}} silenced by a slap from Robert. After she leaves, Robert tells Eddard that he cannot rule the kingdoms if the Lannisters and Starks are <b>at</b> <b>war</b> and insists that Eddard remain the Hand of the King, or else Robert will give the position to Jaime. Robert also informs Eddard {{that he will be}} regent while Robert is away on a hunting trip.|$|E

His final book was fiction, a thriller entitled Golden Arrow, published in 1955.|$|E
