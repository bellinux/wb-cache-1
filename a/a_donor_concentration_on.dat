40|$|The {{influences}} of <b>donor</b> and acceptor <b>concentrations</b> <b>on</b> Forster resonant energy transfer (FRET) in a separated donor-acceptor quantum dot bilayer structure have been investigated. Donor intra-ensemble energy transfer {{is shown to}} have an impact on the donor-acceptor FRET efficiency in the bilayer structure. At high <b>donor</b> <b>concentrations</b> the FRET distance dependence and the acceptor concentration dependence in the separated donor-acceptor layer structure agree well with theories developed for FRET between randomly distributed, homogeneous donor and acceptor ensembles. However, discrepancies between measurement and theory are found at low <b>donor</b> <b>concentrations.</b> <b>A</b> <b>donor</b> <b>concentration</b> study shows that the FRET efficiency decreases with increasing <b>donor</b> <b>concentration</b> even though <b>a</b> <b>donor</b> concentration-independent FRET efficiency is predicted by standard theory. The observed dependence of the FRET efficiency <b>on</b> the <b>donor</b> <b>concentration</b> can be explained within the FRET rate model, for <b>a</b> constant, <b>donor</b> <b>concentration</b> independent FRET rate, by taking into account the <b>concentration</b> dependent <b>donor</b> reference lifetime arising from intra-donor ensemble FRET. This shows that the decrease in the FRET efficiency with increasing <b>donor</b> <b>concentration</b> is not <b>a</b> signature of a change in the donor-acceptor FRET rate, but due to the competition of the donor-acceptor and donor-donor energy transfer for the higher energy <b>donors.</b> <b>As</b> the intra-donor ensemble FRET represents another decay mechanism, the donor quantum yield for the higher energy donors decreases with increasing donor quantum dot (QD) concentration, as can also be seen from the redshift of the donor emission spectrum. Using this <b>concentration</b> dependent <b>donor</b> quantum yield in the calculation of the Forster radius, the FRET theory for homogeneous donor and acceptor ensembles can be modified to include the effect of the donor intra-ensemble transfer and to correctly describe the trends and absolute values of the measured FRET efficiencies as a function of the donor and the acceptor concentrations. These results show that in QD systems where intra-donor ensemble FRET is as important as the radiative and nonradiative donor decay mechanisms, the FRET rate rather than the FRET efficiency more appropriately characterizes the donor-acceptor FRET. By fitting with the rate model, FRET rates as high as (1. 2 ns) (- 1) have been determined for the structures presented here...|$|R

Previous studies investigating {{the reduction of}} Fe(III) oxides by DMRB focused on reactions under constant initial electron donor (lactate) and electron acceptor (Fe oxide) concentrations.

Below this value, N- and P-donors result in comparable sheet resistances. The critical concentration represents an upper limit for electrically active N donors, while P donors can be activated at concentrations above 10 (exp 20) cm- 3. This high concentration of electrically active P donors is responsible for the observed low sheet resistance of 35 Omega, which is about one order of magnitude lower than the minimum sheet resistance achieved by N implantation...|$|R
40|$|A {{diffusion}} {{model for the}} percutaneous absorption of a solute through the skin is developed for the specific case of <b>a</b> constant <b>donor</b> <b>concentration</b> with <b>a</b> finite removal rate from the receptor due to either perfusion rate or sampling. The model has been developed to include a viable epidermal resistance and a donor-stratum corneum interfacial resistance. Numerical inversion of the laplace domain solutions were used for simulations of solute flux and cumulative amount absorbed and to model specific examples of percutaneous absorption. Limits of the Laplace domain solutions were used to define the steady-state flux, lag time, and receptor concentration. Steady-state approximations obtained from the solutions were used to relate the steady-state flux and the effective permeability coefficient to the viable epidermis resistance, a donor-stratum corneum interfacial resistance, receptor removal rate, and partitioning between the receptor and donor phases. The lag time was shown {{to be dependent on}} these parameters and on the Volume of the receptor phase. It is concluded that curvilinear cumulative amount and flux-time profiles are dependent on the processes affecting percutaneous absorption, the shapes of the profiles reflecting the processes most determining transport...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we study}} {{theoretically}} and experimentally {{the influence of}} the surface electron accumulation on the optical properties of InN nanowires. For this purpose, the photoluminescence and photoluminescence excitation spectra have been measured for a set of self-assembled InN NWs grown under different conditions. The photoluminescence excitation experimental lineshapes have been reproduced by a self-consistent calculation of the absorption in a cylindrical InN nanowires. With the self-consistent model we can explore how the optical absorption depends on nanowires radius and doping concentration. Our model solves the Schrödinger equation for a cylindrical nanowire of infinite length, assuming a parabolic conduction band. The columnar geometry introduces effects in both the electron density and in the self-consistent conduction band profile, with no equivalence in planar layer. On the other hand, the differences in the photoluminescence excitation spectra are related to the inhomogeneous electron distribution inside the nanowires, caused by <b>a</b> bulk <b>donor</b> <b>concentration</b> and <b>a</b> two-dimensional density of ionized surface states. For nanowire radii larger than 30 nm, such concentrations modify the absorption edge and the lineshape, respectively, and can be determined from the comparison with the experimental data (© 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we have {{annealed}} hydrothermally (HT) grown ZnO samples at temperatures ranging from 600 C to 1600 C, {{and examined the}} effects on the lithium content, the resistivity and the surface topography. Starting with highly resistive samples, we managed to reduce both the Li concentration and the resistivity with four orders of magnitude each to 10 ^ 13 cm^- 3 and < 1 ohm*cm, respectively. Our findings showed a correlation between the Li concentration and the resistivity, and also a polarity effect on the surface roughness resulting from, what we believe, is lithium (Li) diffusion. We then tuned the resistivity and the surface roughness of some HT ZnO samples, before realizing palladium (Pd) Schottky diodes on the (000 - 1) O-face, resulting in diodes with following properties: current rectification of up to eight orders of magnitude from - 2 V to 2 V, low series resistance of 20 ohm, low ideality factor of 1. 06, reverse current density of J(V=- 2) = 10 ^- 7 A/cm^ 2 and <b>an</b> effective <b>donor</b> <b>concentration</b> of mid- 10 ^ 16 cm- 3. A surface polarity effect on the diode quality was also observed...|$|R
40|$|Silicon is {{promising}} for spin-based quantum computation because nuclear spins, {{a source of}} magnetic noise, may be eliminated through isotopic enrichment. Long spin decoherence times, $T_ 2 $, have been measured in isotope-enriched silicon but come {{far short of the}} $T_ 2 = 2 T_ 1 $ limit. The effect of nuclear spins on $T_ 2 $ is well established. However, the effect of background electron spins from ever present residual phosphorus impurities in silicon can also produce significant decoherence. We study spin decoherence decay as <b>a</b> function of <b>donor</b> <b>concentration,</b> $^{ 29 }$Si concentration, and temperature using cluster expansion techniques specifically adapted to the problem of a sparse dipolarly coupled electron spin bath. Our results agree with the existing experimental spin echo data in Si:P and establish the importance of background dopants as the ultimate decoherence mechanism in isotope-enriched silicon...|$|R
40|$|Several {{strains of}} Gram-negative and Gram-positive sulphate-reducing {{bacteria}} (SRB) {{are able to}} use carbon monoxide (CO) as a carbon source and electron donor for biological sulphate reduction. These strains exhibit variable resistance to CO toxicity. The most resistant SRB can grow and use CO as <b>an</b> electron <b>donor</b> at <b>concentrations</b> up to 100 %, whereas others are already severely inhibited at CO concentrations as low as 1 - 2 %. Here, the utilization, inhibition characteristics, and enzymology of CO metabolism {{as well as the}} current state of genomics of CO-oxidizing SRB are reviewed.
