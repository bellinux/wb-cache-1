5|$|The chassis was {{manufactured}} from aluminium using Alcan's bonded aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT), {{and had a}} wheelbase of 2845mm. The {{design for}} the chassis featured rear wheel steering and packaged the fuel tank behind the centre bulkhead. Suspension design largely focused on road use, but a good compromise for racing use was achieved and the suspension height was adjustable. The concept car was fitted with a four-channel <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{braking system}} is {{conventional}} hydraulic (Power assisted) with disk brakes {{at the front}} and drum brakes at the rear. <b>Anti-lock</b> <b>Braking</b> <b>System</b> and Traction Control System is fitted. The hand/parking brake is cable operated, acting on the rear wheels. The hydraulic fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear loading platform. There are interlocks on the braking system so that the starting up process can only be initiated when the brake pedal is pressed.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} {{the end of}} the second queue, guests were loaded into test cars. Upon dispatching from the loading dock, the car was brought through an accelerated hill climb. Next, the car's suspension was tested over different types of road surfaces, including German and Belgian blocks & cobblestones. Next, the car's <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> was turned off and the car tried to navigate a course of cones, knocking many over in the process. The anti-lock brakes were then turned back on and a similar cone course was navigated easily. Guests were shown a video overlay of the difference. Then, the cars were brought through 3 environmental chambers: a heat chamber, a cold chamber, and a corrosion chamber.|$|E

40|$|<b>Anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} safety systems for wheeled vehicles. They reduce the braking distance and, most importantly, help the user maintain controllability and steerability of the vehicle. This paper extends and adapts the concept of <b>Anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> to tracked vehicles, specifically to snowmobiles. Snowmobiles are an interesting development platform for two main reasons: 1) track dynamics, despite being analogous to tire dynamics, present important differences that help understanding the features of the control algorithm and 2) snowmobiles are simple and rugged vehicles with a limited set of sensors, making the design of an effective control system challenging. The paper designs a track-deceleration based ABS algorithm and tests it both in straight riding and cornering. The analysis shows that, on snowmobiles, <b>Anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> have negligible advantages in term of stopping distance, but are beneficial in terms of steerability and stability, during cornering...|$|R

25|$|The 1991 {{model was}} {{completely}} restyled—It replaced the 1977-based rectilinear design with rounded, more aerodynamic sheetmetal. While {{the body and}} interior were all new, excluding the <b>Anti-Lock</b> <b>Braking</b> <b>System,</b> the chassis and powertrain were carried over from the 1990 model.

25|$|Many newer {{vehicles}} feature traction control, which partially mitigates {{the poor}} traction characteristics {{of an open}} differential by using the <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> to limit or stop the slippage of the low traction wheel, increasing the torque {{that can be applied}} to the opposite wheel. While not as effective as a traction-aided differential, it is better than a simple mechanical open differential with no traction assistance.|$|E

25|$|By 1977 the {{batteries}} were coming along, and Ballard and Prater were shuttling {{back and forth}} between Arizona and Vancouver. Ballard had always wanted to return to Canada, so Schwartz sold his interest in the battery technology to Ballard for $1, while Ballard sold his interest in Schwartz's latest venture, a mechanical <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> for the same $1. In 1979 Ballard moved to Vancouver and became president and CEO of Ultra Energy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> (ABS) and Traction {{control system}} (TCS) (referred to as TCL on FTOs) {{can also be}} found as factory-fitted options on some earlier models such as the sports GX model. An easy-visual check for fitment of ABS to an FTO is to look in the engine bay - an alloy block, with six brake pipes emerging, will be present behind the battery and down against the bulkhead. ABS was {{standard}} equipment on facelift models.|$|E
25|$|ESC {{incorporates}} {{yaw rate}} control into the <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> (ABS). Yaw is a rotation around the vertical axis; i.e. spinning left or right. Anti-lock brakes enable ESC to brake individual wheels. Many ESC systems also incorporate a {{traction control system}} (TCS or ASR), which senses drive-wheel slip under acceleration and individually brakes the slipping wheel or wheels and/or reduces excess engine power until control is regained. However, ESC serves a different purpose from that of ABS or Traction Control.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{a design}} expertise for {{active safety systems}} {{with reference to the}} two-wheeled vehicles. The special emphasis is placed on various approaches to the <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> <b>systems.</b> Taking into account the specificity of motorcy-cles, scooters and other two-wheeled vehicles, the variants of single and double-channel braking control are examined. Approbation of developed control strategy has been performed through simulation with AMESim software. This allowed to consider the very important factors like hysteresis losses in brake gears and re-sponse time of brake drive. In accordance with results of virtual testing, the paper proposes an evaluation of pre-extreme algorithms for motorcycle <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

25|$|The initial Canberra PR3 {{model was}} shortly succeeded by the {{improved}} PR7 variant. The PR7 featured greater fuel capacity via wing storage, {{the more powerful}} RA.7 model of the Avon engine, and Maxaret <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system.</b> The Canberra PR9 was the final photo reconnaissance version; this aircraft was furnished with a new crew compartment, a redesigned inner wing section, and much more powerful RA.24 Avon engine. In later service, bomber models of the Canberra were often converted with cameras and other equipment suited for reconnaissance purposes.|$|E
25|$|The Veyron's brakes use cross drilled, {{radially}} vented {{carbon fibre}} reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC) composite discs, manufactured by SGL Carbon, {{which have a}} much greater resistance to brake fade when compared with conventional cast iron discs. The lightweight aluminium alloy monobloc brake calipers are made by AP Racing; the fronts have eight titanium pistons and the rear calipers have six pistons.
