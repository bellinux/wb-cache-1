The TDC uses a delay chain and <b>register</b> <b>array</b> structure to produce lower bits in addition to higher bits from a clock counter. Lacking the direct controls custom chips, the FPGA implementation of the delay chain and <b>register</b> <b>array</b> structure had to address two major problems: (1) the logic elements used for the delay chain and <b>register</b> <b>array</b> structure must be placed and routed by the FPGA compiler in a predictable manner, to assure uniformity of the TDC binning and short-term stability. (2) The delay variation due to temperature and power supply voltage must be compensated for to assure long-term stability. They used the chain structures in the existing FPGAs that the venders designed for general purpose such as carry algorithm or logic expansion to solve the first problem.

40|$|The wave {{pipeline}} {{effect is}} based on the equalization of all path delays in order to allow several Awaves@ of data to travel along the circuit with a separation several times smaller than the maximum combinational delay of the circuit. The construction of wave pipelines requires gates and buffers with dataindependent delay, and a well-characterized interconnection network delay model, in order to allow the equalization process to be managed by the designer. These features are inherently present in several RAM-based FPGAs architectures.
