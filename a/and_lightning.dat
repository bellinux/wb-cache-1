5|$|The {{detonation}} {{was initially}} planned for 04:00 MWT but was postponed because of rain <b>and</b> <b>lightning</b> from early that morning. It was {{feared that the}} danger from radiation and fallout would be increased by rain, <b>and</b> <b>lightning</b> had the scientists concerned about a premature detonation. A crucial favorable weather report came in at 04:45, and the final twenty-minute countdown began at 05:10, read by Samuel Allison. By 05:30 the rain had gone. There were some communication problems. The shortwave radio frequency for communicating with the B-29s was shared with the Voice of America, and the FM radios shared a frequency with a railroad freight yard in San Antonio, Texas.|$|E

5|$|Between 4:45 and 5:00 pm, {{a number}} of people in the area of Winona, Minnesota, were observing a {{thunderstorm}} approaching from the northwest.

5|$|During Part II of {{the series}} the concept of , {{altering}} the quality of chakra, is introduced. Nature manipulation allows ninja, following certain training, to convert their chakra into one of five elements: earth, water, fire, wind, <b>and</b> <b>lightning.</b> Each element is predominant and subordinate to different elements; for example, fire is weak against water, but can easily counter and even gain strength when used against a wind-based jutsu and earth is weak against lightning based jutsu. Most ninja have a natural affinity {{for one of the}} five elements, allowing them to use jutsu of that type with greater ease. Ninja with an affinity for fire, for instance, will be able to breathe fire much sooner than {{they will be able to}} manipulate water.|$|E
5|$|In Lightning Returns, {{after being}} {{released}} from his imprisonment, Snow meets up with Noel and Hope before coming upon the city of Yusnaan and becomes its protector and patron. Over the next five hundred years, he becomes jaded and depressed, brooding on Serah's death and being weighed down by guilt at his inability to stop the world decaying. When Lightning meets up with him, his changed appearance and attitude makes her fear that he has gone insane. When they next meet, Snow reveals his intention to absorb a massive cloud of Chaos {{at the center of}} Yusnaan's palace, transform into a Cie'th and have Lightning kill him as a punishment for his failure. He performs this act <b>and</b> <b>Lightning</b> does battle him, but she manages to reverse the transformation and convince him to keep hoping and help guide Serah to the new world.|$|E

5|$|In many of {{the legends}} of the Cascade Mountains, there are thunderbirds that live on them and Adams is no exception. This {{particular}} thunderbird was named Enumtla and he terrorized {{the inhabitants of the}} land. Speelyi, the Klickitat coyote god, came along one day and they implored him to do something. Speelyi transformed himself into a feather and waited. It did not take long for Enumtla to see the feather and investigate. Being suspicious, he thundered at the feather with no effect. He paused and suddenly the magic feather let loose a terrific volley of thunder <b>and</b> <b>lightning</b> and stunned Enumtla. Speelyi then managed to overpower Enumtla and decreed that the thunderbird could no longer terrify the people, could only thunder on hot days, and could not destroy with lightning.|$|E
5|$|Research {{focused on}} four {{individual}} days that accumulated more than 5.9 inches (15cm) of hail in 30 {{minutes on the}} Colorado front range has shown that these events share similar patterns in observed synoptic weather, radar, <b>and</b> <b>lightning</b> characteristics, suggesting the possibility of predicting these events prior to their occurrence. A fundamental problem in continuing {{research in this area}} is that, unlike hail diameter, hail depth is not commonly reported. The lack of data leaves researchers and forecasters in the dark when trying to verify operational methods. A cooperative effort between the University of Colorado and the National Weather Service is in progress. The joint project's goal is to enlist the help of the general public to develop a database of hail accumulation depths.|$|E
5|$|The {{eighteenth century}} book {{consists}} {{of a collection of}} letters and essays written by Franklin. Most of the 25 letters in the collection were to Collinson. Some had personal content, but most were about his experiments with electricity and what he had observed from them. These talked about the conclusions he came to after doing scientific experimentation on Leyden jars <b>and</b> <b>lightning</b> storm clouds. He many times related the similarities of how each of these acted and that the principles they followed were identical. This connection ultimately led Franklin to the lightning rod and that the electricity could be diverted harmlessly away from houses and wooden buildings - making it a protection device.|$|E

5|$|The general {{goal of a}} {{level is}} to gain control over every village on an island, {{accomplished}} through acts that persuade the villagers {{to believe in the}} player. Villagers can be swayed by everything from assistance with day-to-day tasks to being terrorised by fireballs <b>and</b> <b>lightning</b> storms. Artefacts (special objects that glow in their owner's colour) and missionary disciples can be used to impress villagers. Villagers become bored with repetitive attempts to impress them. For example, if boulders fly overhead too frequently, their effect is lost. This forces the player to use multiple methods to convert a village.|$|E
5|$|The {{team were}} at home against the New England Revolution of MLS for the fifth round, on July 8. They easily won with goals from Conor Casey and Le Toux.

Le Toux had a strong history with Seattle and the tournament before moving to the Union in 2009; he {{previously}} played for the second-division incarnation of the Sounders and won the 2009 Open Cup with the MLS side. He would later be named the runner-up to the year's Most Valuable Player of the Tournament.

The main soundtrack, despite some tracks being critiqued, was generally praised as a good selection of music and a fitting conclusion {{to the music of}} the Final Fantasy XIII series. It was also praised by reviewers of the game as a whole. The Soundtrack Plus album was reviewed less favorably. Both commercial albums sold well enough to be placed on the Oricon charts, with the Original Soundtrack reaching #29 and remaining on the charts for four weeks.|$|E
