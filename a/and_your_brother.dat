25|$|The {{execution}} {{by lethal}} injection began at 10:53pm EDT. In his final words, Davis maintained his innocence, saying:Well, first of all I'd like to address the MacPhail family. I'd like to let you all know, despite the situation – I know {{all of you are}} still convinced that I'm the person that killed your father, your son <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother,</b> but I am innocent. The incident that happened that night was not my fault. I did not have a gun that night. I did not shoot your family member. But I am so sorry for your loss. I really am – sincerely. All I can ask is that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you really will finally see the truth. I ask my family and friends that you all continue to pray, that you all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls. God bless you all. He was declared dead at 11:08pm EDT.|$|E
2500|$|L: You have {{certainly}} done your duty. As I told you only this morning, I admire your courage and your great contributions to your country. No one can {{take away from}} you the credit for all you have done. Now I am worried about your physical safety. I have a report that those {{in charge of the}} current activity offer you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> safe conduct out of the country if you resign. Had you heard this? ...|$|E
2500|$|In 198, when Liu Bei was {{planning}} to break free of Cao Cao's control by leaving the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan), he sent Sun Qian and Mi Zhu to secretly contact Cao's rivals Yuan Shao and Liu Biao and form alliances with them. After Yuan Shao's death in 202, Liu Biao once wrote to Yuan Shao's third son and successor, Yuan Shang, and mentioned the rivalry between Yuan Shang and his eldest brother Yuan Tan. Liu Biao wrote: [...] "Whenever I discussed this issue (the rivalry between you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother)</b> with General Liu (Liu Bei) and Sun Gongyou, I feel very upset and heartbroken." [...] Both Liu Bei and Liu Biao highly regarded Sun Qian.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Finally, I {{resolved}} {{to come here}} alone, and appeal to you. I {{resolved to}} come here alone, and entreat you to retract the course you have chosen, and instead of confiding in a mere stranger--a person of most insolent behaviour to <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> others--to prefer <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother's</b> friend.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] {{answered}} Dick again, in {{a cheerful}} voice; [...] "doubtless Master de Cressi <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brothers</b> have moved away {{to escape the}} pest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} that you have only three days left to look for the little dog for <b>your</b> father, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brothers</b> have found lovely ones?" ...|$|R
2500|$|As a child, Archie {{was very}} quiet but very mischievous - {{especially}} {{when he was with}} his brother Quentin; growing up, Archie and Quentin were very close. They rarely left each other's side and had very few fights. But as for the other siblings, Archie was not close to either Kermit or Ethel, because they would gang up on him. Ted would help beat up Kermit for him and would also tell their mother, Edith, about Ethel, who would often get in trouble. Alice was ten years older than Archie, and he barely remembered her being around, since she would often go places with other family members and friends. Archie was an avid reader and very good at putting puzzles together quickly. His father remarked to him, “Archie, my smart boy, never give up your smartness; that goes for you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> Quentin." ...|$|E
2500|$|On one occasion, Mu'awiya {{ascended the}} minbar and praised Allah. When {{he wanted to}} speak, a lad of the Ansar {{interrupted}} him and said, [...] "Mu'awiya! What makes you {{and the people of}} your house more entitled to this wealth than us! We have no wrong action against you that we know of other than our slaying of your uncle Walid, your grandfather 'Uqba, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> Hanzala." [...] Mu'awiya said, [...] "By Allah, nephew, you did not kill them. Rather Allah killed them with angels upon angels {{at the hands of the}} sons of their father. That was not a fault nor a loss." [...] The Ansari said, [...] "So where is the fault and loss then?" [...] He said, [...] "You spoke the truth. Do you need something?" [...] He said, [...] "Yes. I look after an old woman and sisters and things have been hard on us." [...] Mu'awiya said, [...] "Take what you can from the treasury." [...] The boy took it and then Mu'awiya resumed his khutba.|$|E
60|$|RANKIN. That was me, sir. My name is Leslie Rankin; <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> and I {{were always}} Miles and Leslie to one another.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Mulgar should live, like me, in the water, then he, too, {{would never}} know of cold. Whither do you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brothers</b> wander, O Mulgar?" ...|$|R
60|$|BRODIE. Good and right? They are strange words, Mary. I {{mind the}} {{time when it was}} good and right to be <b>your</b> father's {{daughter}} <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother's</b> sister.... Now!...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, not yet, Junkie," [...] {{returned}} Barret; [...] "he {{has been}} faithful to his {{promise not to}} go on with that story till you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brothers</b> are present." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{it surely}} won't kill me," [...] she replied; [...] "and, {{if it makes}} you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> happy, I'm willing to take some chances." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was here, was it not," [...] asked Biarne, [...] "that you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> saw {{the salmon}} leaping on the {{occasion}} of your first visit?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Except, I suppose, that he <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> {{went off}} into the wood to discuss it, where Mr. Crane mislaid his sword, {{not to mention his}} companion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Said anything? Just {{guess he}} has. Why, {{the whole school}} is so upset nobody knows what he is doing. Do you know what {{happened}} after you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brothers</b> ran away?" ...|$|R
60|$|JOHN. Not at all, Maggie; the nobleness {{has been}} yours in waiting so patiently. <b>And</b> <b>your</b> <b>brothers</b> would insist {{on it at}} any rate. They're {{watching}} me like cats with a mouse.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps, Rover, perhaps. And {{it will be}} {{instructive}} to all here, to watch you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brothers</b> manipulate the biplane. But do not let {{the use of the}} machine interfere with your studies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are nothing}} but a crank," [...] she declared; [...] "you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother,</b> too! You've lived among those flinty rocks till you've become almost like them yourselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The peddler <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> {{will soon}} be here, but I must not {{be seen by the}} royal officer, or the life of Birch might be the forfeiture." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I propose," [...] {{said the}} Eremite, [...] "that {{yourself}} <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> Iskander should tarry with me some days, if, indeed, my simple fare have any temptation." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Do {{you forget}} that you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brothers</b> are solely {{responsible}} for my present position? That but for you I would have married the Widow Stanhope and started {{one of the finest}} boys' school in New York State?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{puts you}} in the wrong?" [...] cried my lord, I thought very tartly for so mild a man. [...] "You have earned my {{gratitude}} <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother's</b> many thousand times: you may count on its endurance; and let that suffice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Every one {{tells me}} he is quite able {{to make his way}} at school; I am only anxious to know which public school you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> would prefer.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor do I." [...] Then {{after a pause}} he continued; [...] "She said {{something}} which made me think that she <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> haven't quite hit it off together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But the law {{itself will}} not be quite as complaisant as the 'folks.' It will {{scarcely}} allow incendiaries to escape; <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> would be compelled to flee the land." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, fine! I made papa {{drive me}} over to see the game. It's going to be {{something}} grand, so I've heard," [...] went on Minnie, and then she added: [...] "Thought you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brothers</b> were coming to see us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Things are not unapt {{to be and}} go through, {{where you}} are concerned, Mr. Jock, I suspect," [...] said Mr. Ogilvie. [...] "Suppose you were to come with me, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brothers</b> too, <b>and</b> be {{introduced}} to the swans on the lake at Belforest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Live for <b>your</b> mother <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brothers,</b> Bella; {{they need}} you sorely, {{and in time}} I know you will find true {{consolation}} in it, although you must relinquish much. Sustain your mother, cheer Augustine, watch over Harry, and be to them what Helen longed to be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do mean that. But Stillwell <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> {{think the}} guerrillas wanted money and arms, {{and they just}} {{happened}} to make off with you because you ran under a horse's nose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whatever has {{got your}} {{precious}} father, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> Tiny Tim!" [...] exclaimed Mrs. Cratchet, [...] "here's dinner {{all ready to}} be dished up. I've never known him so late on Christmas day before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So this is Thomas Rover," [...] said Captain Victor Putnam, with {{something}} like {{a twinkle in his}} clear eyes. [...] "Rover, I have heard a rather serious report about you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother</b> Richard." ...|$|E
6000|$|And now, as to your reward, {{you shall}} in truth take your sister home with you, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brothers</b> I will restore to life; but idle and unfaithful {{as they are}} their lot is to wander for ever. And so farewell, and may wisdom be with you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Then the Water-midden looked {{long and}} gravely at {{him out of}} darkling eyes. She put out her hand and touched his.

6000|$|... "Now, God bless you, Margery," [...] {{added the}} bee-hunter. [...] "Providence has brought me <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>brother's</b> family {{together}} in troublesome times; should I get back safe from this adventure, I shall look upon it as {{a duty to}} do all I can to help Gershom place his wife and sister {{beyond the reach of}} harm." ...|$|R
