60|$|While at Saratoga, I {{was much}} struck with the <b>air,</b> <b>position</b> and deportment of a gentleman who {{appeared}} to command the respect, and to obtain the ears of all {{the leaders in the}} American camp, while he held no apparent official station. He wore no uniform, though he was addressed by the title of general, and had much more of the character of a real soldier than Gates who commanded. He must have been between forty and fifty at that time, and in the full enjoyment of the vigor of his mind and body. This was Philip Schuyler, so justly celebrated in our annals for his wisdom, patriotism, integrity, and public services. His connection with the great northern campaign is too well known to require any explanations here. Its success, perhaps, was more owing to his advice and preparations than to the influence of any one other mind, and he is beginning already to take a place in history, in connection with these great events, that has a singular resemblance to that he occupied during their actual occurrence: in other words, he is to be seen in the background of the great national picture, unobtrusive and modest, but directing and controlling all, by the power of his intellect, and the influence of his experience and character. Gates[1] was but a secondary personage, in the real events of that memorable period. Schuyler was the presiding spirit, though forced by popular prejudice to retire from the apparent command of the army. Our written accounts ascribe the difficulty that worked this injustice to Schuyler, to a prejudice which existed among the eastern militia, and which is supposed to have had its origin in the disasters of St. Clair, or the reverses which attended the earlier movements of the campaign. My father, who had known General Schuyler in the war of '56, when he acted as Bradstreet's right-hand man, attributed the feeling to a different cause. According to his notion of the alienation, it was owing to the difference in habits and opinions which existed between Schuyler, as a New York gentleman, and the yeomen of New England, who came out in 1777, imbued with all the distinctive notions of their very peculiar state of society. There may have been prejudices on both sides, but {{it is easy to see}} which party exhibited most magnanimity and self-sacrifice. Possibly, the last was inseparable from the preponderance of numbers, it not being an easy thing to persuade masses of men that they can be wrong, and a single individual right. This is the great error of democracy, which fancies truth is to be proved by counting noses; while aristocracy commits the antagonist blunder of believing that excellence is inherited from male to male, and that too in the order of primogeniture! It is not easy to say where one is to look for truth in this life.|$|E

50|$|Hot {{air that}} may enter an HVAC system {{connected}} to a transpired collector that has <b>air</b> outlets <b>positioned</b> {{along the top of}} the collector, particularly if the collector is west facing. To counter this problem, Matrix Energy has patented a transpired collector with a lower <b>air</b> outlet <b>position</b> and perforated cavity framing to perpetrate increased air turbulence behind the perforated absorber for increased performance.|$|R
25|$|It is however, {{critical}} to diver safety that the compressor {{is suitable for}} breathing air delivery, uses a suitable oil, is adequately filtered, and takes in clean and uncontaminated <b>air.</b> <b>Positioning</b> of the intake opening is important, and {{may have to be}} changed if the relative wind direction changes, to ensure that no engine exhaust gas enters the intake.

50|$|A Walley jump {{is a full}} {{rotation}} jump {{in figure}} skating where the skater jumps off the backward inside edge, makes one full rotation in the air, and then lands on the backward outside edge of the same foot.

50|$|Modern day sensors are non contact type. These modern non contact TPS include Hall effect sensors, Inductive sensors, magnetoresistive and others. In the {{potentiometric}} type sensors, a multi-finger metal brush/rake is {{in contact}} with a resistive strip, while the butterfly valve is turned from the lower mechanical stop (minimum <b>air</b> <b>position)</b> to WOT, there {{is a change in}} the resistance and this change in resistance is given as the input to the ECU.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{variation}} is the flying layback, that is, a layback spin that is entered through a jump. [...] Differing techniques {{exist for the}} <b>air</b> <b>position,</b> but all require the skater to leap {{up into the air}} with an arch in the back and the free leg held to the side and the skating leg tucked like a flying sit. Since it is a same-foot flying spin, it requires fewer difficult features to attain a high level.|$|E

50|$|In a {{separate}} line of development, the RAF {{was working on}} a pair of mechanical computers known as the Air Milage Unit (AMU) and <b>Air</b> <b>Position</b> Indicator (API), which continually performed dead reckoning calculations, greatly reducing navigator workload. This was fed by inputs similar to those for the Mk. XIV bomb sight, namely the estimated wind direction and speed, with the aircraft heading and speed fed in directly from the aircraft instruments. The system output was a varying voltage {{that could be used to}} drive the Mk. XIV bomb sight.|$|E
50|$|Star lift: The skaters skate face to face. The man has {{one hand}} on his partner's hip and the other {{clasping}} her hand. He raises her until she is horizontal {{with her free hand}} on his shoulder. The <b>air</b> <b>position</b> for this lift is a leg variation with her legs spread in a scissor position {{as if they were the}} points on a star, where is where the lift gets its name. The lift can be made more difficult if she lets go of his shoulder, or if he lets go of her hand and she is supported only by her hip.|$|E

50|$|The flying {{controls}} of the Sea Vixen were relatively complex, which controlled the fully powered tailplane, ailerons and rudder; these controls remained usable {{even in the}} absence of electrical power, such as in the event of a double engine failure. Actuation of the powered flight control surfaces was provided by a pair of independent hydraulic systems and typically featured variable gearing of control movements over differing speeds. An intricate three-section flap arrangement was employed, partially due to the nature of the wing's geometry. The navigation, flight instrumentation and communications equipment included ground and <b>air</b> <b>position</b> indicators, a reference gyro, an autopilot capable of maintaining altitude and speed as well as yaw and pitch damping, tactical air navigation system (TACAN), and ultra high frequency (UHF) radio system.|$|E
