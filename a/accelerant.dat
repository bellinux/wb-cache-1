5|$|Arson {{investigators}} testified as to {{how they}} had located the origin and cause of the house fire, stressing that the multiple unconnected, small fires they had found in the home's basement were evidence of the fire having been set purposely and that char patterns on the house's floors were evidence of a liquid <b>accelerant</b> having been used to start the fire. The living room floor had contained the most significant amount of <b>accelerant,</b> and the trail of <b>accelerant</b> had ended {{at the door of the}} master bedroom, which had been open while the fire burned. The state of the bedroom door contradicted Green's prior testimony to investigators that her bedroom door had been closed and she had only opened it briefly to look into the hallway.|$|E
5|$|Green married Michael Farrar in 1979 while {{practicing}} as {{an emergency}} physician. The marriage was tumultuous, and Farrar filed for divorce in July 1995. Between August and September 1995, Farrar repeatedly fell violently ill, and despite numerous hospitalizations his doctors could not pinpoint {{the source of his}} illness. Green's emotional stability deteriorated and she began to drink heavily, even while supervising her children. On October 24, 1995, the Farrar family home, occupied by Green and the couple's three children, caught fire. Kate Farrar and Debora Green escaped without harm, but despite the efforts of firefighters, Timothy and Kelly Farrar died in the blaze. Investigation showed that trails of <b>accelerant</b> in the house led back to Green's bedroom, and that the source of Michael Farrar's intractable illness had been ricin, a poison served to him in his food by Green.|$|E

25|$|The fire began around 4:30 AM on January 19 {{when most}} {{students}} were asleep. It spread rapidly across three couches {{in the third}} floor lounge and approached temperatures of up to 1500 degrees Fahrenheit (815 degrees Celsius) {{in less than five}} minutes. Though no <b>accelerant</b> was used, the fire burned hot enough to melt the synthetic carpet of the hall, causing severe injuries to many of the students attempting to escape the conflagration by crawling on the floor to reach the stairs. Most students on the third floor evacuated in the thick smoke using the staircases; a few jumped over 40 feet (12 meters) to the ground. Three students died; Aaron Karol and Frank Caltabilota died of thermal injuries, and John Giunta died due to smoke inhalation. Fifty-six students and firefighters were injured, four seriously enough to require lengthy hospital stays and rehabilitation.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>accelerants</b> are hydrocarbon-based fuels, {{sometimes}} referred to as petroleum distillates: gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene, turpentine, butane, and various other flammable solvents. These <b>accelerants</b> are also known as ignitable liquids. Ignitable liquids can leave behind tell-tale marks in the fire debris.

They {{determined that the}} basement level of the home, which contained the furnaces, {{had not been a}} point of origin, though two small orphan fires unconnected to the main burning had occurred in that area. Pour patterns were found on the ground and second floors, indicating that a flammable liquid had been poured there and covered many areas of the ground floor, blocked off the stairway from the second floor to the ground floor, and covered much of the hallway on the second floor. The pour patterns stopped {{at the door of the}} house's master bedroom, but had soaked into carpeting in the hallway leading to the children's bedrooms.

According to Ellen Ryan, when confronted with this evidence, Green acknowledged having set the fire that destroyed her home, but denied any clear memory of the event.

500|$|Ali's longstanding finale was the {{swallowing}} of copious {{amounts of}} water again, but this time followed by a pint of kerosene. A prop was then produced, typically a model castle or house made of metal set on a table, within which a small flame burned. Lighter than water and immiscible with it, the kerosene floated above the liquid in Ali's gut, allowing him to disgorge it first. The stage thus set, and to a drum roll or an imitation of fire bells, Ali became a [...] "human flamethrower", spewing the <b>accelerant</b> in a long stream over the sacrificial prop, setting it ablaze. Once the kerosene was exhausted, the water followed, streaming out his mouth in a long flow from up to six feet away, extinguishing the fire.|$|E
500|$|Forensic chemists' {{analysis}} can provide leads for investigators, {{and they can}} confirm or refute their suspicions. [...] The identification of the various substances found at the scene can tell investigators {{what to look for}} during their search. [...] During fire investigations, forensic chemists can determine if an <b>accelerant</b> such as gasoline or kerosene was used; if so, this suggests that the fire was intentionally set. [...] Forensic chemists can also narrow down the suspect list to people who would have access to the substance used in a crime. [...] For example, in explosive investigations, the identification of RDX or C-4 would indicate a military connection as those substances are military grade explosives. [...] On the other hand, the identification of TNT would create a wider suspect list, since it is used by demolition companies {{as well as in the}} military. [...] During poisoning investigations, the detection of specific poisons can give detectives an idea of what to look for when they are interviewing potential suspects. For example, an investigation that involves ricin would tell investigators to look for ricin's precursors, the seeds of the castor oil plant.|$|E

500|$|In {{seeking to}} find who had {{set fire to}} the Farrar–Green home, {{investigators}} looked first for physical evidence of fire-setting upon those {{who had been in the}} house. They suspected that because of the use of <b>accelerant,</b> the fire may have flashed over at the point of ignition and singed or burned the setter. Accordingly, they tested clothing worn by both Farrar and Green that night and took samples of the hair of both. Neither Green's nor Farrar's clothing showed evidence of having been in contact with accelerant; Farrar's hair showed no singeing, but Green's—which had been cut twice between the time of the fire and the time the police took hair samples from her—showed [...] "significant singeing". Detectives recalled that Green had denied ever having been in close proximity to flames; she had reported leaving the house after seeing smoke and not coming into contact with the fire either on the deck outside her bedroom or in the process of coaxing Kate off the garage roof. Neighbors of the family reported that when Green had come to their door to ask them to call for help, her hair had been wet.
