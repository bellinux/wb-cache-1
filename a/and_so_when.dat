5|$|Bradstreet set {{out from}} Fort Schlosser in early August 1764 with about 1,200 {{soldiers}} and a large contingent of Native allies enlisted by Sir William Johnson. Bradstreet felt {{that he did not}} have enough troops to subdue enemy Native Americans by force, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>when</b> strong winds on Lake Erie forced him to stop at Presque Isle on August 12, he decided to negotiate a treaty with a delegation of Ohio Native Americans led by Guyasuta. Bradstreet exceeded his authority by conducting a peace treaty rather than a simple truce, and by agreeing to halt Bouquet's expedition, which had not yet left Fort Pitt. Gage, Johnson, and Bouquet were outraged when they learned what Bradstreet had done. Gage rejected the treaty, believing that Bradstreet had been duped into abandoning his offensive in the Ohio Country. Gage may have been correct: the Ohio Native Americans did not return prisoners as promised in a second meeting with Bradstreet in September, and some Shawnees were trying to enlist French aid in order to continue the war.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{representing}} a new vessel, the Enterprise-A {{was the same}} model {{that had been used}} since 1979. Poorly regarded by earlier effects artists because of its complicated wiring and bulk, the Enterprises hairline cracks were puttied and sanded down, and the internal circuitry was redone. The new model's running lights were matched to similar intensities, saving the effects artists time because the lights would look correct with only a single pass, instead of three passes required previously (for the sensor dome, running lights, and window lights). One unfortunate byproduct of the fixes was the loss of the model's distinctive pearlescent finish. The elaborate sheen was never visible on screen (lighting schemes prevented reflections while filming so the ship could be properly inserted into effects shots) <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>when</b> the model was repainted with conventional techniques the effect was lost. The Bird of Prey had been damaged from work in The Voyage Home, where the ship was supposed to fly around the sun. To suggest singes, the model had been painted with black-tinged rubber cement, with the expectation that this application would rub off. The cement instead sat on the model and baked itself to the model surface, and had to be scrubbed off.|$|E
5|$|O. G. S. Crawford {{was born}} on 28 October 1886 at Breach Candy, a suburb of Bombay in British India. His father, Charles Edward Gordon Crawford, was a civil servant who had been educated at Marlborough College and Wadham College, Oxford before moving to India, where he became a High Court judge at Thane. The Crawford family came from Ayrshire in Scotland, and the child's great-uncle was the {{politician}} Robert Wigram Crawford. Crawford's mother, Alice Luscombe Mackenzie, {{was the daughter of}} a Scottish army doctor and his Devonshire wife. Alice died a few days after her son's birth, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>when</b> he was three months old, Crawford was sent to England aboard the P liner Bokhara. During the journey he was entrusted to the care of his paternal aunt Eleanor, an Anglican nun who {{was the head of the}} Poona Convent of the Community of St Mary the Virgin.|$|E

25|$|Early in {{his college}} years, {{probably}} {{during the spring}} of 1854 while Ludlow was still at Princeton, his medical curiosity drew him to visit his “friend Anderson the apothecary” regularly. During these visits, Ludlow “made upon myself the trial of the effects of every strange drug and chemical which the laboratory could produce.” A few months before, Bayard Taylor’s Putnam’s Magazine article The Vision of Hasheesh had been devoured by Ludlow, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>when</b> the cannabis-based tetanus remedy called Tilden’s extract came out he had to try some.|$|E

25|$|Nail polish remover has {{the ability}} to enter bodies of water and soil after {{entering}} landfills or by precipitation, such as rain or snow. However, due to acetone's high volatility, most of it that enters the bodies of water and soil will evaporate again and re-enter the atmosphere. Not all of the acetone molecules will evaporate again, <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>when</b> acetone remains in the bodies of water or soil, a reaction will occur. Nail polish remover evaporates easily because acetone's intermolecular forces are weak. An acetone molecule can't attract other acetone molecules easily because its hydrogens are not slightly positive. The only force that holds acetone molecules together is its permanent dipoles which are weaker than hydrogen bonds.|$|E

25|$|Most of the Indians who {{actually}} lived and hunted in the Ohio Valley—Shawnees, Mingos, Delawares, and Wyandots—had not been consulted in the 1768 treaties. Angry with the Iroquois for selling their lands to the British, Shawnees began {{to organize a}} confederacy of western Indians {{with the intention of}} preventing the loss of their lands. British and Iroquois officials worked to diplomatically isolate the Shawnees from other Indian nations, however, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>when</b> Dunmore's War broke out in 1774, Shawnees faced the Virginia militia with few allies. After Virginia's victory in the war, the Shawnees were compelled to accept the Ohio River boundary. Shawnee and Mingo leaders who did not agree with these terms renewed the struggle soon after the American Revolutionary War began in 1775.|$|E
25|$|Heraclius' {{inability}} {{to rule the}} Empire as his death neared did Byzantium no favors. After Heraclius' death in 641, the former Empress Martina declared herself, her son, Heracleonas, and her stepson, Constantine, co-emperors of the Byzantine Empire. However, the citizens of Constantinople refused to accept this. <b>And</b> <b>so,</b> <b>when</b> Constantine III died sometime between May 24 and May 26, 641 (considered {{by the majority of}} the Byzantines to have been done by Martina's hand), Heracleonas and his mother were deposed the following summer. Heraclonas' nose was slit and Martina's tongue was wrenched out. These acts ensured that Heraclonas could never become Basileus (Emperor) – the physical deformation would have made it impossible. However, as suspects of committing regicide, their exile to the island of Rhodes was a light punishment.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s rule {{changes were}} {{introduced}} to try and limit the effect the loose forwards were having on back play. There was no obligation to bind to a scrum for flankers at this time. The offside line was dictated by {{the position of the}} ball even when it was in the scrum, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>when</b> it emerged {{at the back of the}} scrum the scrum-half would often find the opposition flankers and scrum-half arriving with it. The new offside line became the hindmost foot of the scrum. Only the opposition scrum-half could move forward of that point, and all flankers had to stay bound unless they remained behind the hindmost foot of the scrum. Another rule change introduced allowed the number 8 or the rear-most bound forward to detach from a scrum with the ball, previously it could only be retrieved by the scrum-half.|$|E
25|$|Many of Gude's peers {{moved on}} from the Academy in Düsseldorf to other art institutes, but Gude decided to seek more direct contact with nature. Gude had gained a {{foothold}} in the British art market in the 1850s after his works were accepted into the galleries of Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere and the Marquess of Lansdowne, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>when</b> an English art dealer and former student of Gude — Mr. Stiff — suggested Gude might find success in England, he was quick to respond. In the autumn of 1862 Gude set off for the Lledr Valley near Conwy. Wales, a place renowned for its picturesque scenery, was already home to a colony of British plein-air artists. While small groups of artists living in the countryside in order to inspire each other, be closer to their subject and escape the city were common, Gude {{was one of the first}} Norwegian artists to live in such a manner. Gude rented a house overlooking River Lledr where he painted one of the ancient Roman bridges which was popular with artists of the time.|$|E

[...] Luckman was not admitted to Columbia College; instead, he attended the New College for the Education of Teachers, an undergraduate school, which was within Teachers College at Columbia. [...] He competed {{on the football team}} from 1936 until the New College closed in 1939, when he transferred to Columbia College. Coach Little had a problem of getting good high school athletes because of the entrance requirements at Columbia, and Columbia didn’t have any physical education undergraduate program, <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>when</b> New College was started Lou Little was happy because they had a P. E. Department. In fact, the 1936 varsity football squad had five other New College students, Hubert Schulze, Edward Stanzyk, Oscar Bonom, Harry Ream, and Antoni Mareski.|$|E

500|$|The {{music of}} the Persona series has been handled by {{multiple}} composers. The one most associated with the series is Shoji Meguro, who began working on Persona shortly after he joined Atlus in the mid 1990s. His very first composition for the game was [...] "Aria of the Soul", the theme for the velvet room and a recurring tune within the series. During his initial work on the series, Meguro felt restricted by the limited storage space of the PlayStation's disc system, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>when</b> he began composing for Persona 3, which allowed for sound streaming due to increased hardware capacity, {{he was able to}} fully express his musical style. His main worry for his music in Persona 3 and 4 was the singers' pronunciation of the English lyrics. He was unable to work on the Persona 2 titles as he was tied up with other projects, including Maken X. The music for Innocent Sin and Eternal Punishment was handled by Toshiko Tasaki, Kenichi Tsuchiya, and Masaki Kurokawa. Tsuchiya had originally done minor work on Persona, and found composing for the titles a strenuous experience. Meguro returned to work on the series in Persona 5. For this game, Meguro used its themes for inspiration, and used elements of acid jazz to achieve the right mood. Meguro also wrote the theme song for Persona Q, {{while the rest of the}} soundtrack was handled by Atsushi Kitajoh and Toshiki Konishi.|$|E
