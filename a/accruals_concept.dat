40|$|Until the {{introduction}} of the full <b>accrual</b> accounting <b>concept</b> in 2008, the system of governmental and private non-profit organizations in Croatia was very inconsistent, but nevertheless, withstood for a long number of years. Most of the changes were brought in for the purpose of adjusting our legislative regulations to the Acquis Communautaire. The Croatian accession to the European Union was used to implement reforms in various sectors, and also in the accounting for non-profit organizations. On January 1 ST, 2008, a new accounting system was introduced, based on the application of the full <b>accrual</b> <b>concept</b> of revenues and expenses. As a result, the divergence of accounting systems for governmental and private non-profit organizations was significantly reduced. The reform results suggest that it is justified and reasonable, for all non-profit organization groups, to apply the same internationally comparable and acceptable rules of measurement and evaluation, recognition, and economic classification of revenues and expenses.

For instance, a company may be notionally profitable but generating little operational cash (as may be the case for a company that barters its products rather than selling for cash). In such a case, the company may be deriving additional operating cash by issuing shares or raising additional debt finance.|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decades, several {{countries}} worldwide have introduced financial management reforms, {{as an important}} part of the New Public Management (NPM) initiative at one or more levels of government sector, by either replacing or transforming their traditional budgetary cash accounting systems towards a business-like <b>accrual</b> accounting <b>concept.</b> Following the example of this upcoming managerial trend, the Greek government introduced in 2003 the accrual basis accounting into public hospitals, as the hospital sector is one of the areas where NPM reforms have been introduced in search of higher efficiency, effectiveness and economy in service production. The purpose of this paper is twofold. The first goal is to provide an overview of the government sector reform initiatives in Greece and to present empirical evidence regarding the adoption level of the accrual basis accounting standards in the Greek public Health sector.

40|$|Recently {{the world}} wide process of seeking for new {{approach}} to public sector accounting, different from the cameralistic conception, is becoming increasingly intensive. This is apparent mainly in the attempts of a complex application of resources accounting in public entities. Resources accounting {{is based on the}} <b>accrual</b> measurement <b>concept,</b> and the reporting model includes the balance-sheet, profit and loss account and cash-flow statement. Such a system of accounting makes possible the determination of the financial position of an entity and measurement its performance in terms of both global economic resources and cash resources only. The model solution comes from New Zealand. It is the country which was the first to develop and introduce the new system of public sector accounting. The annual report of Christchurch City Council (New Zealand) constitutes the basis for our paper. This is the first local government general purposes financial report prepered according to a business reporting model.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the concept of}} {{materiality}} is at the centre. Just like the going concern <b>concept,</b> the <b>accrual</b> <b>concept,</b> the realization concept and the substance over form concept, the materiality concept is a base for the compilation of the financial statements. Many books have been published on most accounting concepts. Though nearly every law in Europe contains a concept of materiality, little {{attention is paid to}} the concept of materiality. For that reason the concept of materiality is often misunderstood. Materiality plays a role both in the accounting field and in the auditing field. In this paper we concentrate on materiality in accounting. In accounting the concept of materiality is a characteristic of information which helps to optimize the information presented in the financial statements. Materiality states that if information is of such magnitude that it has no influence on the user's judgment and decision-making, it can be left out. In financial accounting materiality may apply to: 1. The degree of specification of the financial information in the balance sheet and the profit-and-loss account (for instance: a balance sheet may consist of some hundreds of items but on the other hand, it may consist of only three items, namely assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity). In this case the way in which materiality is applied has no influence on the magnitude of the equity presented and on the profit. 2. The degree in which supplementary information {{should be included in the}} notes. Examples of this are: information on changes in accounting systems, current values information etc. In these situations the way in which materiality is inter- preted may give an extra insight into the equity and the profit. For example, additional information on the basis of current values may lead to a higher or lower shareholders' equity and/or profit. In this paper we go into the different ways in which the concept of materiality is made operational by law-makers of various European countries. First we will give a clear practical view of the meaning of the concept of materiality and describe how the concept of materiality has been worked out by the various law-makers. Starting point of our paper is the Fourth and the Seventh Directive of the European Community. We will discuss the way in which the regulations concerning materiality are implemented in the laws of the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Netherlands. A comparison will made of these implementations. Financiële gegevens, Nauwkeurigheid...|$|R
40|$|The {{transformation}} from {{cash basis accounting}} to accrual-based accounting in financial reporting of public sector {{is expected to increase}} public accountability of public managers. However, the suitability of accrual-based accounting in the public sector are debatable based on the experience of pioneer countries of accruals. This study explores the perceptions of Malaysian public managers on the applicability of <b>accrual</b> accounting <b>concept</b> in the public sector and the usefulness of accrual-based governmental financial reports towards the public managers in discharging their duties. Besides, this study also highlights the neutral response upon the study. This study finds that there are significant differences between the responses from three different level of government sector on the reporting entity of a consolidated report, the definition and concept of controlled assets by public entities and the use of accumulated surplus and equity as a financial performance indicator. In addition, the study indicates that familiarity and experience over time will contribute to higher perceptions towards the usefulness of accrual-based information. Furthermore, the neutral response from the respondents suggests that an in-depth discussion between the public sector managers and experts from the accounting field to improve the understanding among the Malaysian public sector managers. Hence, this study provides useful insights to the standard setters in the process of MPSAS formulation with regards to the general purpose financial reporting model for the public sector in Malaysia. In addition, it will improve the public accountability practice in Malaysian governmental financial reporting...|$|R
40|$|The International Federation of Accountants {{recommends}} a transition of all accounting {{units in the}} public sector to the accrual basis and issues International Public Sector Accounting Standards to support the new concept. Accounting in the Czech public administration is based rather on the cash base with all its drawbacks and complications Regional administration units are finding out and recording net cash flow directly in the system of synthetic accounts of the core activitity in the ledger, with the priority of recording income and expenses. Organizational parts of the state use the same system of bookkeeping based on the same directive charts of accounts. I percieve a conceptual inconsistence in {{the fact that in the}} system of synthetic accounts, the budget surplus or deficit as the main expression of the accounting cash concept is not being found out neither recorded. An obstacle for implementing the accrual principle lies also in the persistent definition of yields. For the area of budget economy of accounting units of public administration, existence of yields is not admitted. The reason is to be found in business concept of yields expecting yields only in rela- tion to the market. This concept will have to be substituted by a concept which respects so called non-exchangeable yields. Then, based on this concept, yield accounts will be incorporated into the charts of accounts of the core activity of the accounting units. <b>Accrual</b> accounting <b>concept,</b> which is also based on the comparison of costs with performance for which they are expended, creates prerequisites also for depreciation of long-term assets. In the current concept of accounting core activity of public administration these long-term assets are not depreciated. Its appreciation and reporting then intentionally does not respect the requirement of true picture of reality. Therefore the content and methodology of changes have to be considered, especially in the following fields: • Acknowledgement and introduction of the category of income as defined by IPSAS; • Restructuring of the pilot accounting system according to the accrual concept; • Detecting budget inflows or outflows outside the system of the synthetic accounts based on the analytical accounts (budget classification); • Restructuring of the accounting statement scheme, namely its internal structure; • Creating legislative conditions to change the system...|$|R

The second goal of the research is to investigate the impact of a range of potentially contingent factors on hospitals compliance with the accrual financial and cost accounting reform. The present analysis is based on the results of an empirical survey that took place during 2009. For the purposes of this survey, a structured questionnaire was prepared and sent to the Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) of 132 Greek public hospitals. In particular, a linear regression model analysis was used to examine the cross-sectional differences on a number of explanatory and implementation factors of the accounting reform adoption level. The empirical evidence reveals that the level of accrual and especially cost accounting adoption in Greek public hospitals is realized only to a limited extent. In particular, results show that the level of reform adoption is positively related to IT quality, reform related training, education level of accounting staff, and professional consultants' support. However, no significant relationship was found between the level of reform adoption and hospital size, reform implementation cost, CEO educational background, experience effect, and absence of management-physicians conflict relationship. The main contribution of this study is the empirical evidence it provides on the approaches and processes used by the Government of Greece to implement accrual financial and cost accounting systems in the Greek National Health System (GNHS) and the role certain human, organizational and situational factors played in such implementations for enhancing researchers' and managers' understanding of major implementation processes and challenges as well as helping them refine models of effective implementation process and improve systems and processes on similar future projects...|$|R
