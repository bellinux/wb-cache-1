5|$|Palomino Sue {{hails from}} Abilene, Texas. Her {{father was a}} wagon master. She arrived at Boys' Ranch after a trip on the wagon her father was driving was intercepted by Indians. She was the only survivor. When expressing a desire to get {{involved}} in fighting, Clay Duncan insists that, because it's too dangerous for a woman, she must remain <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranch.</b> She agrees, but her acquiescence was a pretence, as she later joins the fray, offering opportune assistance. Similar scenes recur in her two subsequent appearances in issues #5 and 6.|$|E
5|$|A fairly strong easterly {{wind had}} been blowing for three days; {{on the evening}} of the third day, the mosquitos arrived, flying high, about fifty feet, and looking like a cloud of mist over Carancahua Bay. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranch,</b> they set {{everything}} on fire that had blood in it, and all work was suspended by unanimous consent...little or nothing was done for nearly five days; by this time the main body had passed, though plenty remained to make everything uncomfortable for about two weeks. This migration was from east to west and the line was about three miles wide.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranch</b> {{inhabited}} by the Proletheans, a religious extremist group, following her impregnation, Helena is {{introduced to the}} group's nursery where she bonds with a young girl.

Sharing their displeasure with what Henrik has done, Helena and Gracie decide to flee the ranch together, but are caught by Henrik as they are preparing to leave. Henrik's protégé and Gracie's lover, Mark (Ari Millen), arrives to defend Gracie. Mark and Gracie flee together as Helena attacks Henrik. Helena tortures Henrik with his own medical instruments before burning down the ranch and running away herself.|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} fly {{occurrence}} and incidence of fly breeding in leeward Ko- hala, Hawaii, was conducted between August and November, 2007. The survey areas included four state parks and 13 <b>ranches</b> near <b>the</b> coastline. This {{study found that}} the occurrence of two major species of flies, Tricharaea occidua (a flesh fly) and Musca sorbens (dog dung fly) within the complaint areas corresponded with the breeding of flies <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranches</b> nearby; and T. occidua was the principal inhabitant in cattle, horse, and mule dung <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranches...</b>|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, in the Dunphy family, Dylan (Reid Ewing), Haley's boyfriend, tags {{along on}} the trip, much to Claire's chagrin. However, Phil (Ty Burrell) {{eventually}} convinces her that she should {{try to get to}} know Dylan. She attempts to, but suddenly Dylan proposes to Haley (Sarah Hyland) around the campfire one night. This causes Claire (Julie Bowen) to instantly say no for Haley, leading to Dylan running away. The families go off and look for him, during which Haley criticizes Claire for interfering and reveals she would not have accepted Dylan's proposal. It is also revealed that Dylan gets a job <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranch</b> and decides to permanently stay in Wyoming, breaking up with Haley.|$|E
5|$|The Wheeler family stayed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranch</b> many a summer. In 1900, Wheeler invited {{his client}} Phoebe Hearst to visit Wheeler Ranch {{with his family}} for the summer. Hearst {{asked if she could}} {{purchase}} the land, but Wheeler declined. Insistent, Hearst came to an arrangement whereby she would purchase a 99-year lease on part of the land, and she also purchased adjoining land held by Edward Clark, her financial adviser, who called it Wyntoon for the local Wintu tribe. Hearst applied the name Wyntoon to the combination of Clark's former holdings and her new lease, and in 1901 contracted for a magnificent seven-story house to be built. Wheeler was displeased with the extravagant plans, as he and Hearst had previously agreed her building would be modest. However, he did not stop her.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, 13-year-old Sanford Clark {{was taken}} {{from his home in}} Saskatchewan (with the {{permission}} of his mother and reluctant father) by his uncle, 19-year-old Gordon Stewart Northcott. Northcott took Clark to a ranch in Wineville, California, where he regularly beat and sexually abused the boy — until , when the police took Clark into custody after his sister, 19-year-old Jessie Clark, informed them of the situation. Clark revealed that he was forced to help Northcott and his mother, Sarah Louise Northcott, in killing three young boys after Northcott had kidnapped and molested them. The police found no bodies <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranch</b> — Clark said they were dumped in the desert — but discovered body parts, blood-stained axes, and personal effects belonging to missing children. The Northcotts fled to Canada, but were arrested and extradited to the United States. Sarah Louise initially confessed to murdering Walter Collins, she later retracted her statement; Gordon, who had confessed to killing five boys, did likewise.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, back <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranch,</b> Mephesto and his {{assistant}} Kevin have created a human clone of Stan for Terrance. The boys attempt to get the pig and the elephant drunk and to mate, {{but it does not}} seem to be working until Chef stops by and sings to the animals with a little help from Elton John. The cloned Stan breaks free from Mephesto's ranch and proceeds to terrorize the town. The boys eventually find the clone and take it to Stan's house and convince it to attack Shelley; however, it decides to destroy the house and indirectly kills Kenny, by flinging him into a microwave, with a chair. Mephesto shows up and shoots the clone, but Stan is afraid he will be in trouble for everything the clone did. However, in a brief moment of kindness, Shelley takes the blame, after which she beats up Stan.|$|E

25|$|While {{the couple}} spent a {{relatively}} short time there, the ranch became the only property that they ever owned during their marriage and it became a place of rest and relaxation, where Lawrence wrote much of his novel, St Mawr and began The Plumed Serpent, during five months of the summer of 1924.

25|$|Throughout much of {{the summer}} of 2015, parts of New Mexico were {{experiencing}} a monsoon season, likely due to an El Niño. Throughout the season, there had been many other flash flood warnings across New Mexico due to large storms.

25|$|In 1985, fossil hunter Patrick McSherry, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranch</b> of S.B. Smith in Johnson County, Wyoming, {{found the}} remains of a stegosaur.

They, in turn, cooperated with paleontologist Dee Hall of Brigham Young University. At first, it was assumed it represented an exemplar of Stegosaurus. However, Clifford Miles, while preparing the remains, recognised that they belonged to a species new to science.|$|E

25|$|On March 14, 1989, University of Texas at Austin student Mark Kilroy {{was kidnapped}} in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico while vacationing during spring break. He {{was taken by}} his abductors to a ranch where he was {{tortured}} and sodomized for hours before being murdered in a human sacrifice ritual. Kilroy was killed with a machete blow and then had his brain removed and boiled in a pot. His killers then inserted a wire through his backbone, chopped off his legs, and buried him <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranch</b> along with 14 other {{people who had been}} killed there before him. Adolfo Constanzo, the leader of the cult, told his followers that human sacrifice granted them immunity from law enforcement for their drug smuggling operations. The killing drew worldwide media attention and an international police manhunt because of the unusual circumstances of the crime.|$|E
