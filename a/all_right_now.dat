500|$|Starting on the {{electric}} piano, Charles played what felt right: {{a series of}} riffs, switching then to a regular piano for four choruses backed up by a unique Latin conga tumbao rhythm on drums. The song changed when Charles began singing simple, improvised unconnected verses ("Hey Mama don't you treat me wrong / Come and love your daddy all night long / <b>All</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> / Hey hey / All right"). Charles used gospel elements in a twelve-bar blues structure. Some of the first lines ("See the gal with the red dress on / She can do the Birdland all night long") are influenced by a boogie-woogie style that Ahmet Ertegun attributes to Clarence [...] "Pinetop" [...] Smith who used to call out to dancers {{on the dance floor}} instructing what to do through his lyrics. In the middle of the song, however, Charles indicated that the Raelettes should repeat what he was doing, and the song transformed into a call and response between Charles, the Raelettes, and the horn section in the orchestra as they called out to each other in ecstatic shouts and moans and blasts from the horns.|$|E
500|$|On 16 August 2010, Iranian {{officials}} withdrew Mohammed Soleimani {{from the}} men's under-48-kilogram category taekwondo final against Israel's Gili Haimovitz, citing an ankle injury. According to the officials, Soleimani had first hurt his ankle at the World Junior Championships in Mexico {{earlier in the}} year, and the injury had flared up again during his semifinal contest against the US's Gregory English. Soleimani was sent to hospital for an X-ray, and his ankle was put into a cast. Haimovitz was awarded the gold medal by default at a victory ceremony at the Suntec International Convention Centre from which Soleimani, the silver medallist, was absent. Interviewed later on, Soleimani said he was [...] "very sad" [...] to have missed the bout as he was [...] "sure [...] {{was going to get}} the gold medal". Israel's chef-de-mission Daniel Oren claimed that the pullout had been politically motivated. He said: [...] "It's not the first time this has happened at the Olympics. But this is a first for a medal match. To be honest, once our boy got into the final, we knew {{that this is going to}} happen. I spoke to our boy after the final and he, of course, was disappointed that he did not have a chance to win his gold through an actual fight. I feel more sorry for the Iranian boy. He must have trained hard to get to this stage and was not given a chance to fight. We are dealing with sports here, youth sports, in fact. It's a pity that politics got involved." [...] However, IOC spokesman Mark Adams said: [...] "As far as the IOC is concerned, there is no sinister intent here. What we know factually is that the athlete injured his ankle and was sent to the hospital for an X-ray. Tests revealed he did not suffer anything broken, and he is <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> So unless more factual information is available, it [...] is mere speculation." [...] This was reiterated by IOC President Jacques Rogge on 17 August: [...] "He [...] was driven to the hospital, was examined by a Singaporean doctor, totally independent, not belonging to the organisation and he diagnosed an ankle sprain. For us, that's the end of the story." [...] Previously, Iran has stated that since its existing government does not recognize Israel as a state, its policy is to withdraw from competing against the country.|$|E

2500|$|Cork manager Conor Counihan {{expressed}} his feelings {{in the press}} room: [...] "Relief, {{at the end of}} the day. It's fantastic for the lads, each and every one of them. I spoke to them and we have 30 good guys here, but there are a lot of guys down the years who for one reason or another we had to move on from and those guys are part of this. And the last 20 years, we were landed with a fantastic group of players. They made it hard for themselves, but that makes it all the sweeter". Cork captain Graham Canty also {{expressed his}} feelings at a press conference: [...] "Ah. It feels <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> It is humbling being captain of this bunch of players. I don't understand why I am in here, just because I am captain". Canty offered his sympathies to Down captain Benny Coulter for the loss he had suffered.|$|E
2500|$|On January 26, 2011 (Australia Day), Buffett was {{performing}} {{a concert in}} Australia at Sydney's Hordern Pavilion and fell off the stage after an encore. A concert-goer said, [...] "He just {{went over to the}} edge of the stage, like he had numerous times through the night, just to wave, and people were throwing stuffed toys and things at him. And he just took one step too many and just disappeared in a flash. He didn't have time to put his arms out to save himself or anything, he just dropped." [...] Coincidentally, one of Australia's leading trauma surgeons was at the concert and close to the stage; Dr. Gordian Fulde treated Buffett at the scene. Fulde said, [...] "I thought he'd broken his neck.... I heard the clunk of his head on a metal ledge, he has a deep gash on his scalp, which is <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>now....</b> But at first I thought: this guy is going to be a spinal injury." [...] Dr Fulde turned him on his side so he could breathe and administered first aid. Buffett regained consciousness within a few minutes. He was then transported to St Vincent's Hospital Emergency centre for treatment and was released the next day. Buffett returned to Australia in 2012 for two shows in Brisbane and Melbourne, and made much fun of the incident during those shows. In the Melbourne show in the historic Palais Theatre in the Melbourne beachside suburb of St. Kilda he presented additional verses of [...] "Margaritaville" [...] in which he made humorous references to the accident, much to the audience's delight.|$|E
