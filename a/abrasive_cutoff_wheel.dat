30|$|Tooth crowns were {{separated}} from the roots by using a high-speed cutting machine (Struers Minitom, Struers, Denmark) with a diamond <b>abrasive</b> <b>cutoff</b> <b>wheel</b> (Struers, Denmark) operating at 300  rpm under water irrigation. The crowns were then cut into two halves and embedded in epoxy resin (EpoFix, Struers, Denmark) with their longitudinal sections exposed. One half of the crown {{was used for the}} nanoindentation tests, and the other half was used for the nanoscratch tests. Five specimens (4  mm[*]×[*] 4  mm[*]×[*] 2  mm) for each restorative material [lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (IPS e.max CAD) (Ivoclar Vivadent AG), polymer-infiltrated-ceramic networks (PICN) (Vita Zahnfabrik, Bad Sackingen, Germany), composite resin block (Lava™ ultimate) (3 M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany), and conventional composite resin (Fltek™ Z 350 XT) (3 M ESPE, MN, USA)] were also prepared. The specimens were sequentially polished, beginning with # 800 mesh SiC paper (silicon carbide paper, Struers) and then with increasingly finer abrasives until # 4000 mesh. Thereafter, the specimens were polished with 3  μm and 0.04  μm abrasive particle solutions (OP-S NonDry, Struers, Denmark) with a water base. Finally, the specimens were ultrasonically cleaned for 15  s. In this study, the enamel was divided into three layers, namely, the outer enamel, which has a maximum distance of at most 100  μm from the occlusal surface; the middle enamel, which is located midway between the occlusal surface and the EDJ (middle enamel); and the inner enamel, which has a maximum distance of at most 100  μm from the EDJ (inner enamel) [25].|$|E
40|$|A failure {{analysis}} was undertaken after an <b>abrasive</b> particulate composite <b>cutoff</b> <b>wheel</b> failed in operation, injuring a worker. Compact tension tests and bend tests {{were performed on}} samples cut at various angles from the failed wheel and from unused wheels. Relative fracture toughness values calculated from the compact tension tests showed the dependence of plateau toughness on fiber orientation. Specimens with fibers normal to the crack direction exhibited a higher plateau toughness than those with mis-aligned fibers. Energy absorbed during fracture, calculated from the bend tests, reduced markedly with fiber orientation. Specimens with fibers parallel to the loading direction absorbed more energy during failure than those with mis-aligned fibers. It was determined that the catastrophic nature of this failure {{could be attributed to}} reduced fracture toughness resulting from the unfortuitous fiber orientation. In addition, the accident need not have been so severe had reasonable safety procedures been followed...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the issue of defects {{generation}} during the separation of the castings from a nickel-based superalloy, Inconel 738 LC. The technology of investment casting is presented, followed by a description of metallurgy of superalloys, their physical and mechanical properties, as well as their technical applications. The machinability of superalloys and method of castings separation were also described {{as well as some of}} the casting defects that were reported to have impact on the generation of the defects after cutting. In the experimental part, the material microstructure and casting defects were analyzed. The experimental machining part consisted first of a comparative study of the friction sawing and plasma arc cutting technology at the standard operating conditions actually used in production. Second, an optimization study for the friction sawing was carried out, with a special focus on the suitability of an alternative <b>cutoff</b> <b>wheel</b> for the chosen application. Application of this wheel allows reducing the security distance between the cut and the part, thus reducing the production cost of the part...|$|R
40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} for machining MgO crystal blocks into forms for containing metallic and silicate liquids at temperatures up to 2, 400 C, and pressures up to at least 320 kilobars. Possible custom shapes include tubes, rods, insulators, capsules, and guides. Key differences in this innovative method include drilling along the crystallographic zone axes, use of a vibration minimizing material to secure the workpiece, and constant flushing of material swarf with a cooling medium/lubricant (water). A single crystal MgO block is cut into a section. 5 mm thick, 1 cm on a side, using a low-speed saw with a 0. 004 blade. The cut is made parallel to the direction of cleavage. The block may be cut to any thickness to achieve the desired length of the piece. To minimize drilling vibrations, the MgO block is mounted {{on a piece of}} adhesive putty in a vise. The putty wad cradles {{the bottom half of the}} entire block. Diamond coring tools are used to drill the MgO to the desired custom shape, with water used to wet and wash the surface of swarf. Compressed air may also be used to remove swarf during breaks in drilling. The MgO workpiece must be kept cool at all times with water. After all the swarf is rinsed off, the piece is left to dry overnight. If the workpiece is still attached to the base of the MgO block after drilling, it may be cut off by using a diamond <b>cutoff</b> <b>wheel</b> on a rotary hand tool or by using a low-speed saw...|$|R
