Autochrome plates incorporated a mosaic color filter layer made of dyed grains of potato starch, which allowed the three color components to be recorded as adjacent microscopic image fragments. After an <b>Autochrome</b> <b>plate</b> was reversal processed to produce a positive transparency, the starch grains served to illuminate each fragment with the correct color and the tiny colored points blended together in the eye, synthesizing {{the color of the}} subject by the additive method. Autochrome plates were one of several varieties of additive color screen plates and films marketed between the 1890s and the 1950s.|$|E

50|$|The {{photographic}} reproduction of natural colour {{by means of}} a black-and-white photograph taken and viewed through a mosaic of tiny colour filters was an idea first patented and published by Louis Ducos du Hauron in the late 1860s, but the incomplete colour sensitivity of contemporary photographic materials made it impractical at that time. John Joly independently reinvented the concept in 1894 and attempted to commercialise it, but the first successful product based on this idea, the <b>Autochrome</b> <b>plate,</b> did not reach the market until 1907. Several competing mosaic colour screen plate products soon appeared, including Louis Dufay's Dioptichrome plate, but the <b>Autochrome</b> <b>plate</b> remained by far the most popular. A film-based version of Autochrome was introduced in 1931, shortly before the first Dufaycolor product appeared.|$|E

50|$|The first {{widely used}} method of color {{photography}} was the <b>Autochrome</b> <b>plate,</b> a process inventors and brothers Auguste and Louis Lumière {{began working on}} in the 1890s and commercially introduced in 1907. It was based on one of Louis Ducos du Hauron's ideas: instead of taking three separate photographs through color filters, take one through a mosaic of tiny color filters overlaid on the emulsion and view the results through an identical mosaic. If the individual filter elements were small enough, the three primary colors of red, blue, and green would blend together {{in the eye and}} produce the same additive color synthesis as the filtered projection of three separate photographs. Autochrome plates had an integral mosaic filter layer with roughly five million previously dyed potato grains per square inch added to the surface. Then {{through the use of a}} rolling press, five tons of pressure were used to flatten the grains, enabling every one of them to capture and absorb color and their microscopic size allowing the illusion that the colors are merged together. The final step was adding a coat of the light capturing substance silver bromide after which a color image could be imprinted and developed. In order to see it, reversal processing was used to develop each plate into a transparent positive that could be viewed directly or projected with an ordinary projector. One of the drawbacks of the technology is an exposure time of at least a second was required during the day in bright light and the worse the light is, the time required quickly goes up. An indoor portrait required a few minutes with the subject not being able to move or else the picture would come out blurry. This was because the grains absorbed the color fairly slowly and that a filter of a yellowish-orange color was added to the plate to keep the photograph from coming out excessively blue. Although necessary, the filter had the effect of reducing the amount of light that was absorbed. Another drawback was that the film could only be enlarged so much until the many dots that make up the image become apparent.|$|E
50|$|The National Geographic Society made {{extensive}} use of Autochromes and other mosaic color screen plates for over twenty years. 15,000 original <b>Autochrome</b> <b>plates</b> are still preserved in the Society's archives.|$|R
50|$|Advantages of the Paget {{system was}} that Paget plates were more {{sensitive}} than contemporary <b>autochrome</b> <b>plates,</b> allowing exposures of around 1/25 second (four times faster than autochrome), plus it was a negative/positive process with a separate colour screen which meant that multiple prints were straightforward to produce.|$|R
2500|$|Prokudin-Gorsky {{was also}} {{acquainted with the}} use of <b>Autochrome</b> color <b>plates,</b> which did not require a special camera or projector. He was one of the favored few the Lumière Brothers {{introduced}} to their new product in 1906, the year before it went into commercial production. <b>Autochrome</b> <b>plates</b> were expensive and not sensitive enough for casual [...] "snapshots" [...] with a hand-held camera, but their use was simple and in expert hands they were capable of producing excellent results. They made color photography truly practical for advanced amateurs and led some pioneering users of color separation cameras to abandon their methods as outmoded, but Prokudin-Gorsky was not won over. No Autochromes by Prokudin-Gorsky are known to survive.|$|R

In 1911, she joined the Royal Photographic Society becoming a fellow as early as 1912. In 1913, at 51, Murdoch {{became the first woman}} photographer to travel around the world, taking both <b>Autochrome</b> <b>plates</b> and black-and-white negatives. Her journey took her to Egypt, Palestine, India, Burma, Hong Kong, China, Japan, the Philippines and Hawaii. She returned to Boston via the west coast in 1915.|$|R
50|$|The colour image {{can only}} be viewed in the {{reflection}} of a diffuse light source from the plate, making {{the field of view}} limited, and it cannot be copied. The technique was very insensitive with the emulsions of the time and it never came into general use. Another reason Lippmann's process of colour photography did not succeed {{can be found in the}} invention of the <b>autochrome</b> <b>plates</b> by the brothers A. and L. Lumière.Lippmann photographic techniques are being developed to produce images which can easily be viewed, but not copied, for security purposes.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{practical and}} commercially successful color photography reversal process was the Lumière Autochrome, introduced in 1907. This was an additive method, using a panchromatic emulsion coated on a thin glass plate previously {{coated with a}} layer of dyed potato starch grains. <b>Autochrome</b> <b>plates</b> were discontinued in the 1930s, after the introduction of Lumière Filmcolor in sheet film and Lumicolor in roll film sizes. Also using the additive principle and reversal processing were the Agfa color screen plates and films and Dufaycolor film, all of which were discontinued by 1961.|$|R
50|$|In 1909, Kahn {{travelled}} {{with his}} chauffeur and photographer, Alfred Dutertre, to Japan on business {{and returned with}} many photographs of the journey. This prompted him to begin a project collecting a photographic record of the entire Earth. He appointed Jean Brunhes as the project director, and sent photographers to every continent to record images of the planet using the first practical medium for colour photography, <b>Autochrome</b> <b>plates,</b> and early cinematography. Between 1909 and 1931 they collected 72,000 colour photographs and 183,000 meters of film. These form a unique historical record of 50 countries, known as The Archives of the Planet.|$|R
50|$|As {{a member}} of the shore party in early 1911, Ponting helped set up the Terra Nova Expedition's Antarctic winter camp at Cape Evans, Ross Island. The camp {{included}} a tiny photographic darkroom. Although the expedition came more than 20 years after the invention of photographic film, Ponting preferred high-quality images taken on glass plates.Ponting {{was one of the first}} men to use a portable movie camera in Antarctica. The primitive device, called a cinematograph, could take short video sequences. Ponting also brought some <b>autochrome</b> <b>plates</b> to Antarctica and took some of the first known color still photographs there.|$|R
5000|$|Millions of <b>Autochrome</b> <b>plates</b> were {{manufactured}} {{and used}} during the quarter century before the plates were replaced by film-based versions in the 1930s. The very last film version, named Alticolor, brought the Autochrome process into the 1950s but was discontinued in 1955. Many additive color screen products were available between the 1890s and the 1950s, but none, {{with the possible exception}} of Dufaycolor, introduced as film for still photography in 1935, was as popular or successful as the Lumière Autochrome. The most recent use of the additive screen process for non-digital photography was in Polachrome, an [...] "instant" [...] 35mm slide film introduced in 1983 and discontinued about twenty years later.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{ordinary}} black-and-white <b>plates,</b> the <b>Autochrome</b> {{was loaded}} into the camera with the bare glass side facing the lens, so that the light passed through the mosaic filter layer before reaching the emulsion. The use of an additional special orange-yellow filter in the camera was required to block ultraviolet light and restrain the effects of violet and blue light, parts of the spectrum to which the emulsion was overly sensitive. Because of the light loss due to all the filtering, <b>Autochrome</b> <b>plates</b> required much longer exposures than black-and-white plates and films, which meant that a tripod or other stand had to be used {{and that it was}} not practical to photograph moving subjects. The plate was reversal-processed into a positive transparency — that is, the plate was first developed into a negative image but not [...] "fixed", then the silver forming the negative image was chemically removed, then the remaining silver halide was exposed to light and developed, producing a positive image.|$|R
50|$|Fred Payne Clatworthy (1875-1953) was a {{landscape}} photographer who worked primarily out of Estes Park, Colorado. He {{was known for}} his work with the <b>Autochrome</b> Lumiere screen <b>plate,</b> an early color photography format.|$|R
50|$|Color {{photography}} {{is almost as}} old as black-and-white, with early experiments including John Herschel's Anthotype prints in 1842, the pioneering work of Louis Ducos du Hauron in the 1860s, and the Lippmann process unveiled in 1891, but for many years color photography remained {{little more than a}} laboratory curiosity. It first became a widespread commercial reality with the introduction of <b>Autochrome</b> <b>plates</b> in 1907, but the plates were very expensive and not suitable for casual snapshot-taking with hand-held cameras. The mid-1930s saw the introduction of Kodachrome and Agfacolor Neu, the first easy-to-use color films of the modern multi-layer chromogenic type. These early processes produced transparencies for use in slide projectors and viewing devices, but color prints became increasingly popular after the introduction of chromogenic color print paper in the 1940s. The needs of the motion picture industry generated a number of special processes and systems, perhaps the best-known being the now-obsolete three-strip Technicolor process. In contemporary times, laws were developed wherein prohibitions have been placed against the productions of certain photographs, such as those of highly classified regions, copyrighted works and children's genitalia.|$|R
2500|$|The {{additive}} RGB {{model and}} variants such as orange–green–violet {{were also used}} in the <b>Autochrome</b> Lumière color <b>plates</b> and other screen-plate technologies such as the Joly color screen and the Paget process {{in the early twentieth}} century. Color photography by taking three separate plates was used by other pioneers, such as the Russian Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky in the period 1909 through 1915. [...] Such methods lasted until about 1960 using the expensive and extremely complex tri-color carbro Autotype process.|$|R
50|$|Autochromes {{continued}} to be produced as glass plates into the 1930s, when film-based versions were introduced, first Lumière Filmcolor sheet film in 1931, then Lumicolor roll film in 1933. Although these soon completely replaced glass <b>plate</b> <b>Autochromes,</b> their triumph was short-lived, as Kodak and Agfa soon began to produce multi-layer subtractive color films (Kodachrome and Agfacolor Neu respectively). Nevertheless, the Lumière products had a devoted following, above all in France, and their use persisted long after modern color films had become available. The final version, Alticolor, was introduced in 1952 and discontinued in 1955, marking {{the end of the}} nearly fifty-year-long public life of the Autochrome.|$|R
