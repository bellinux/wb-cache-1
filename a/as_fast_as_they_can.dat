5|$|The crew {{contacts}} Sulu, who informs {{them the}} conference is being held at Camp Khitomer. Both ships head for the talks <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can.</b> As Enterprise nears the planet, Chang's cloaked Bird of Prey moves to intercept. With Enterprise unable to track his ship's position, Chang inflicts severe damage on Enterprise and then Excelsior. At the suggestion of Uhura, the Enterprise's communication officer, Spock and McCoy modify a photon torpedo to home in on the exhaust emissions of Chang's vessel, using equipment originally intended to study gaseous anomalies. The torpedo impact reveals Chang's location, and Enterprise and Excelsior destroy the Bird of Prey with a volley of torpedoes. Crew from both ships beam to the conference and halt an attempt on the Federation president's life. Kirk pleads for those present to continue the peace process. Having saved the peace talks, Enterprise is ordered back to Earth by Starfleet Command to be decommissioned, but the crew decide to take their time on the return voyage. As Enterprise cruises towards a nearby star, Kirk proclaims that though this mission is the final cruise of Enterprise under his command, others will continue their voyages.|$|E

2500|$|With {{digital cable}} comes on-demand news programming. News {{operations}} slowly {{begin to feel}} the burden to generate news content on a 24-hour news cycle, while keeping material fresh on their regularly scheduled newscasts. This means around-the-clock coverage. Rather than having a certain deadline for scheduled newscasts to meet, reporters have to file stories <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can.</b> Producers, on the other hand, have to find more ways to keep news stories [...] "fresh" [...] to the viewers.|$|E
2500|$|Alternative {{versions}} of the game include: children caught [...] "out" [...] by the last rhyme may stand on a pressure plate {{behind one of the}} children forming the original arch, instead of forming additional arches; and, children forming [...] "arches" [...] may bring their hands down for each word of the last line, while the children passing through the arches run <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> to avoid being caught on the last word. It was often the case, in Scottish playgrounds, that children would pair into boy and girl and the ones [...] "caught" [...] would have to kiss.|$|E
2500|$|The {{attack was}} widely {{condemned}} across Iraq and internationally. The new designated Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, demanded {{the police to}} investigate the crime scene <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> and let nothing like this ever happen again. His coalition, the National Iraqi Alliance, [...] "condemned the massacre regardless of who is behind it" [...] but coalition members criticised the suspension of talks, saying this [...] "is not the answer but rather serves the perpetrators of the massacre". The newly appointed Sunni Arab speaker of the parliament, Salim al-Jabouri, called for political unity and emphasised that [...] "all the political entities condemned the crime". Other Shi'ite militias condemned the attack, with the Asaib Ahl al-Haq describing it as [...] "barbaric" [...] and [...] "a crime that we cannot {{turn a blind eye}} to." ...|$|E

2500|$|Typical {{individuals}} are [...] long and weigh [...] Queens are larger and may weigh well over , the largest reaching [...] They are well-adapted to their underground existence. Their eyes are quite small, and their visual acuity is poor. Their legs are thin and short; however, {{they are highly}} adept at moving underground and can move backward <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> move forward. Their large, protruding teeth are used to dig and their lips are sealed just behind the teeth, preventing soil from filling their mouths while digging. About a quarter of their musculature {{is used in the}} closing of their jaws while they digâ€”about the same proportion that is utilized in the human leg. They have little hair (hence the common name) and wrinkled pink or yellowish skin. They lack an insulating layer in the skin.|$|E
2500|$|Pollinator constancy: to {{efficiently}} transfer pollen, it is {{best for}} the plant if the pollinator focuses on one species of plant, ignoring other species. Otherwise, pollen may be dropped uselessly on the stigmas of other species. Animals, of course, do not aim to pollinate, they aim to collect food <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can.</b> However, many pollinator species exhibit constancy, passing up available flowers to focus on one plant species. Why should animals specialize on a plant species, rather than move to the next flower of any species? Although pollinator constancy [...] was recognized by Aristotle, the benefits to animals are not yet fully understood. The most common hypothesis is that pollinators must learn to handle particular types of flowers, and they have limited capacity to learn different types. They can only efficiently gather rewards from one type of flower.|$|E
2500|$|... {{written in}} about 1660. This account is {{particularly}} noteworthy as {{he refers to}} football by its correct name in English and {{is the first to}} describe the following: modern goals and a pitch ("a close that has a gate at either end. The gates are called Goals"), tactics ("leaving some of their best players to guard the goal"), scoring ("they that can strike the ball through their opponents' goal first win") and the way teams were selected ("the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness"). He is the first to describe a law of football: [...] "They often break one another's shins when two meet and strike both together against the ball, and therefore there is a law that they must not strike higher than the ball". His account of the ball itself is also very informative: [...] "They blow a strong bladder and tie the neck of it <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> and then put it into the skin of a bull's cod and sew it fast in". He adds: [...] "The harder the ball is blown, the better it flies. They used to put quicksilver into it sometimes to keep it from lying still". His book includes the first (basic) diagram illustrating a football pitch.|$|E
