5|$|On Tech's first {{offensive}} {{play of the}} game, <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> by Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller was dropped. During {{the next}} play, Tech picked up four yards on a running play. On third down, Druckenmiller completed <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> to wide receiver Bryan Still, but the play fell one foot short of a first down. Tech punted after three plays, just as Texas had done. Texas returned the kick to its 22-yard line, and with 11:49 remaining in the quarter, the Longhorns began their second possession of the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Tennessee in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a first-and-10 at the Virginia Tech 37-yard line after a long punt return. Stewart ran twice for six yards, then Manning completed <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> to Kent at the 20-yard line for a first down. Manning then completed <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> to Nash for another first down at the Tech five-yard line. Two plays later, Stewart scored his third touchdown of {{the game with a}} five-yard run to {{the right side of the}} field. The extra point was good, and with 13:17 remaining in the game, Tennessee took a 4216 lead.|$|E

In this vein, a pawn majority, {{a greater number of}} pawns belonging to one player {{on one side of the}} chessboard, is strategically important because it can often be converted into <b>a</b> <b>passed</b> pawn.|$|R

5|$|After {{receiving}} the punt, Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan connected on a 31-yard pass to wide receiver Brandon Robinson. As before, however, the offense stalled. On 4th-and-1 from the Virginia Tech 30-yard line, Ryan attempted <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> that fell incomplete, turning {{the ball over}} on downs. As a result of pressure applied by the Boston College defense, the Hokies continued to have difficulty moving the ball.|$|E
5|$|Bolton {{started the}} second half on the attack. Bolton were awarded a free-kick, {{following}} a foul on Thompson, by Liverpool defender Rob Jones, who was shown a yellow card. From the subsequent free-kick, Bolton striker John McGinlay received the ball, keeping it from the onrushing James, his pass into the Liverpool penalty area found Mixu Paatelainen whose volleyed shot went wide of the Liverpool goal. Bolton had another attack almost immediately. <b>A</b> <b>pass</b> by McAteer found Thompson {{on the right side}} of the pitch, but his shot went across the face of the Liverpool goal. Liverpool began to assert more pressure following the attack. <b>A</b> <b>pass</b> by striker Ian Rush in the 52nd minute found Bjørnebye, whose subsequent shot hit the post. Another Liverpool attack was stopped by Bolton defender Mark Seagraves as he intercepted a cross from Bjørnebye to Rush, but his interception went towards the Bolton goal and was only stopped by Branagan.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland {{held its}} {{training}} camp at Bowling Green University, {{as it did}} the year before. The Browns played one preseason game in late August against the Baltimore Colts, a new AAFC team formed to replace the Miami Seahawks after the Seahawks folded. The Browns scored their first points on a drive in the second period. A 14-yard run by fullback Marion Motley set up a 25-yard touchdown throw by quarterback Otto Graham to end Mac Speedie. Cleveland scored three more touchdowns in the game, all of them following Colts passes the Browns intercepted. One of them was <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> by Graham to end Dante Lavelli in the third quarter, and another was a rush by halfback Edgar Jones. Paul Brown pulled most of the Browns' starters from the game as the team built up a three-touchdown lead. Backup end Bob Cowan scored a fourth Cleveland touchdown in the final quarter on <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> from backup quarterback Ermal Allen, and the Browns won 28–0. Following the victory, the Browns faced the Buffalo Bills in the regular-season opener at Cleveland Stadium to begin their defense of the AAFC championship.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the game, the Hokies struggled on offense and were held scoreless until well into the second quarter. Kansas, however, was able to get on the board several times, jumping to a 17–0 lead before Virginia Tech scored its first points. Kansas's broke the game open in the first quarter after All-American cornerback Aqib Talib intercepted <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> by backup Virginia Tech quarterback Tyrod Taylor and returned the ball 60yards for the game's opening points.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Maryland {{advanced}} to the Oklahoma 20-yard line, and Tatum elected for a field goal attempt. Now against the wind, the kick failed, with the ball going wide right. The Sooners took over on downs and halfback Jack Ging completed <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> to end Max Boydston for a five-yard gain. Ging then rushed for threeyards. On the next play, Calame pitched to Grigg who ran {{to the left and}} picked up 12yards for a first down. Calame then completed <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> to back Bob Burris for sixyards. Grigg faked <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> and ran to the right for a gain of 12yards and a first down on the Maryland 39-yard line. The Terrapins stopped two Sooner rushing attempts before Calame connected with Burris again for an 11-yard gain. Burris then rushed for threemore yards to advance to the Maryland 25. Tatum called a time-out. On third down with oneyard to go, Calame faked a handoff to Ging and executed an option run to the left. He pitched to Grigg and threw a block. Grigg was tackled at the goal-line but managed to extend his body into the endzone. Buddy Leake made the extra point. Shortly before halftime, Calame suffered a separated collarbone. With back-up Pat O'Neal also injured, only third-string quarterback Jack Van Pool remained, and he had little game experience.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's offense began {{play from}} the Hoosiers' 34-yard line {{following}} the kick. Paci scrambled for several yards, then completed <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> {{for a first}} down at the 50-yard line. On the next play, however, Paci fumbled the ball, which bounced {{into the hands of}} Tech defensive end Lawrence Lewis, who returned it 20yards for a touchdown. The score and extra point gave Tech a 2113 lead with 23 seconds remaining before halftime. Virginia Tech's post-score kickoff was returned to the Tech 42-yard line, potentially setting up an Indiana field goal try before halftime. Paci completed <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> to the 36-yard line, and the few seconds remaining in the first half apparently ran off the clock before Indiana could use its final timeout to stop the clock.|$|E

5|$|Kansas, {{which had}} won the pre-game coin toss, {{received}} the ball to open the second half. Todd Reesing initially began where he had left off in the first half, completing <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> to Dexton Fields for 12yards and a first down. On subsequent plays, however, Virginia Tech showed some of the defensive prowess that had been promoted heavily heading into the game. Aqib Talib was tackled for a loss of sixyards after catching <b>a</b> <b>pass.</b> Reesing was sacked under heavy pressure from the Tech defense. On third down, a Reesing pass was nearly intercepted by Cody Grimm, who knocked it down to force a Kansas punt. On the subsequent return, Virginia Tech earned its first big play of the game. Eddie Royal, who had returned every one of Virginia Tech's first-half kicks, received the ball and lateraled it to Justin Harper, who returned it 84yards for a touchdown. The score cut Kansas' lead to just three points with 11:35 remaining in the third quarter.|$|E
