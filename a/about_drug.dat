In 1960, he moved to Tijuana, Baja California, where he became active in reporting on corruption and the drug trade. He was promoted to news editor at the daily newspaper El Mexicano before moving to the daily La Voz de la Frontera, of which he became editor-in-chief.

The Hifuryaku is a massive Chinese dictionary in 1000 fascicles listing the usage of words and characters in more than 1500 texts of diverse genres. Compiled in 831 by Shigeno Sadanushi and others, it is the oldest extant Japanese proto-encyclopedia. There are two National Treasures of the Ishinpō, the oldest extant medical treatise of Japanese authorship compiled in 984 by Tanba Yasuyori.

25|$|On March 28, 1995, O'Connor's adopted son Hugh {{committed}} suicide {{after a long}} battle with drug addiction. Following his son's death, O'Connor appeared in public service announcements for Partnership for a Drug Free America and {{spent the rest of}} his life working to raise awareness <b>about</b> <b>drug</b> addiction. O'Connor also successfully lobbied to get the state of California to pass legislation allowing family members of an addicted person or anyone injured by a drug dealer's actions, including employers, to sue for reimbursement for medical treatment and rehabilitation costs and other economic and noneconomic damages. The law, known as the Drug Dealer Civil Liability Act in California, went into effect in 1997. It is also referred to as the Hugh O'Connor Memorial Law. The act is based on the Model Drug Dealer Liability Act authored in 1992 by then Hawaii U.S. Attorney Daniel Bent. The Model Drug Dealer Liability Act has been passed in 17 states and the Virgin Islands. A website devoted to the Act can be found at: www.ModelDDLA.com.

Rootes remarked: [...] "When I was frowing up, my dad was really violent. I knew it was something I had to write a song about – {{to get it out}} of my system." [...] The song inspired the album cover, which depicts a cat holding a mouse in its jaw. Rootes explained that the mouse's black eye represents a moment of serenity before it dies. Similarly, the song [...] "Scream" [...] deals with rape issues, while [...] "Dirty Old Bird" [...] is about spousal abuse. The track [...] "Technicolour Yawn" [...] is about the unpleasant effect of a hangover, [...] "Psychofudge" [...] is <b>about</b> <b>drug</b> usage, and [...] "Cheap" [...] deals with one's loss of virginity and the subsequent feel of becoming [...] "sort of cheap and common." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's lyrics {{delve into}} Lo's hedonistic {{attempts}} to forget her former boyfriend. According to Markos Papadatos of Digital Journal, the narrator describes her attempts {{to overcome a}} failed relationship through binge eating and alcohol, as indicated in the lyrics about having the munchies, eating Twinkies, and throwing up during the first verse. In the chorus, she sings <b>about</b> <b>drug</b> abuse: [...] "You're gone and I gotta stay high / All the time, to keep you off my mind". According to Adam R. Holz of Plugged In, in the bridge, Lo approaches the theme of [...] "knowing—at some level—just how empty and self-obliterating her choices really are", as she talks about needing to take someone home in order to relieve her suffering. The singer confessed to iHeart Radio that the song's bridge is her {{favorite part of the}} track because [...] "that just says everything [...] song is about for me". However, Billboard Jeremy D. Larson considered the song's message untrue because [...] "staying high does not keep anyone off your mind".|$|E

The song [...] "Hip Hop Quotables" [...] by Ludacris, from his album Chicken-n-Beer, also contains the line.

500|$|American Gangster {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics.

[...] Reviewing the album for Entertainment Weekly, Neil Drumming {{said it was}} more than [...] "a throwback album" [...] and that Jay-Z adjusts his flow to each production while [...] "emerging cockier than ever on the next track". Village Voice critic Amy Linden praised its live instrumentation, finding it lush, sexy, and [...] "tailor-made for the '70s theme ... without being shamelessly retro". According to The Observers Steve Yates, [...] "it's Jay-Z's and American Gangsters triumph that reflecting on his appetite seems to have reawakened it". Nathan Rabin from The A.V. Club called the record a [...] "surprisingly strong return to form", while Hot Press journalist Chris Wasser found its songs smooth and clever, [...] "intelligent numbers that, instead of bombarding us with stale rhyming schemes and plastic beats, groove ever so effectively." [...] Greg Kot was impressed by the complexity of Jay-Z's metaphors <b>about</b> <b>drug</b> trafficking, making music, and relationships; he wrote in the Chicago Tribune that the rapper offers the kind of multidimensional lyrics that characterize classic hip hop.|$|E

Pitchfork Media's Carrie Battan described his version as [...] "chopped-up, stretched out, cathedral-ready". On February 14, 2014, American rapper Kanye West, frequent collaborator of Jay-Z, released the official remix of [...] "Drunk in Love", featuring an explicit verse by himself and a slightly modified instrumental produced by Mike Dean. In his lines, West rapped about his wife Kim Kardashian and referenced the video for his own song, [...] "Bound 2" [...] (2013). A day {{after the release of}} the remix, Beyoncé uploaded a 30-second clip in which she played a cowgirl corralling horses as West's vocals played in the background. Miriam Coleman of Rolling Stone felt that West's rework was an [...] "even raunchier spin on the already-adult-themed song". The remix version was later included on the track listing of the platinum edition of Beyoncé, released on November 24, 2014. Diplo produced an EDM-influenced remix of the song, which he released on February 15, 2014. Canadian singer The Weeknd and American rapper T.I. both released their respective remixes on the same date; the former's version featured lyrics <b>about</b> <b>drug</b> use and corruption.
