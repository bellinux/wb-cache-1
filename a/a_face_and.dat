Diesel feuded with Michaels and defended the belt against him at WrestleMania XI.|$|E
5|$|DVD film reviews have {{suggested}} the film influenced director John Woo; critics have compared the graphic {{detail of the}} face transplant scene in Woo's action film Face/Off (1997) to the face transplant scene in Eyes Without <b>a</b> <b>Face</b> <b>and</b> noted the similarity. Another resemblance is Woo's trademark use of white doves in his films {{that is similar to}} the character Christiane's dove-laden escape in the film's finale.|$|E

5|$|On March 10, 2005, London {{became the}} number one {{contender}} for Chavo Guerrero's WWE Cruiserweight Championship, which he later won in a cruiserweight battle royal. Guerrero challenged London for the title at Judgment Day, where London emerged victorious. During another title match with Guerrero on June 23, The Mexicools stormed the ring, attacking both London and Guerrero. On the July 14 episode of SmackDown!, London teamed with Scotty 2 Hotty and Funaki to face The Mexicools. The ending of the match saw Juventud perform the 450° splash on London for the win, but landed his knee onto London's face and legitimately broke his nose in the process. London lost the Cruiserweight Title on the August 4 episode of Velocity to Nunzio. Later in the night, London cut a heel promo encouraging the fans to protest his title loss. London went on a losing streak before returning as <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> teaming with the newly rehired Brian Kendrick.|$|E
5|$|On July 24, 2014, Hardy {{returned}} to TNA as <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> reunited with Jeff Hardy to reform The Hardys {{for the third}} time. At the Destination X episode of Impact Wrestling, The Hardys were defeated by The Wolves in a match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. The next week, Matt {{was one of many}} TNA wrestlers who stopped Dixie Carter from running away from Team 3D, which led to Carter being put through a table. On the August 14 episode of Impact Wrestling, Team 3D (formerly the Dudley Boyz) challenged The Hardys to a match, which Team 3D won. At the Hardcore Justice episode of Impact Wrestling, The Hardys and Team 3D talked about a match involving themselves and The Wolves. When The Wolves were asked by the two teams, they agreed. Later that night, Kurt Angle announced all three teams would compete in a best of three series for the TNA World Tag Team Championship with the winners of the first match choosing the stipulation of the next one. The Hardys won the second match of the series on the September 10 episode of Impact Wrestling in a tables match and choose a ladder match for the third match of the series. The Hardys were unsuccessful in winning that match on the September 17 episode of Impact Wrestling, as the Wolves won that match. The Wolves then went on to pick the final match of the series to be a Full Metal Mayhem match to take place on the October 8 episode of Impact Wrestling. The Hardys were unsuccessful in that match as the Wolves won that match.|$|E

25|$|Steve Keirn {{made his}} {{professional}} wrestling debut in 1972, working {{mostly in the}} Southern territories of the United States.

Stan Lane made his professional debut in 1974 and like Keirn had worked mainly in the Southern regions.

25|$|Heads {{may appear}} cabossed (also caboshed or caboched): {{with the head}} cleanly {{separated}} from the neck so that only the face shows; couped: with the neck cleanly separated from the body so that the whole head and neck are present; or erased: with the neck showing a ragged edge as if forcibly torn from the body. While cabossed heads are shown facing forward (affronté), heads that are couped or erased face dexter unless otherwise specified for differencing. Heads of horned beasts are often shown cabossed to display the horns, but instances {{can be found in}} any of these circumstances.

Throughout The Invasion, Big Show reverted to being <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> remained loyal to the WWF. He faced Shane McMahon, the on-screen owner of WCW, in a Last Man Standing match at Backlash and was defeated following interference from Test. Following an unscripted backstage interview, Big Show burst into tears and fled from the arena.

500|$|Hawley {{also brought}} his visual effects {{supervisor}} John Ross from Fargo. Ross coordinated multiple visual effects vendors for Legion, {{which he described}} as [...] "a bit of a crapshoot" [...] because artists were often not able {{to work on the}} same shot week-to-week. He noted that though [...] "hundreds of thousands of dollars" [...] was spent on major visual effect sequences for the show, [...] "we don’t dwell on that aspect. There’s a jeep that gets slammed down , which the characters hide behind before it gets flung back into the building, but we pan off it, just throwing it away, because the destruction isn’t the point of the scene." [...] He compared this mindset to M. Night Shyamalan's approach to superpowers in Unbreakable. When realizing characters' special abilities, Ross said it [...] "comes down to tying this fantastic beam coming out to somebody’s hand, and showing how it lights up <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> distorts the air as it travels across frame. We want it to look as much like a live interactive element as we can imagine it to be." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{release of}} Lizard {{merchandise}} designs along with unconfirmed concept art featuring a humanoid-shape {{with a layer}} of scales on top instead of a pronounced snout (similar to a dinosaur or crocodile) as in the most recent comics, produced a mixed reaction. Many commenters compared it to other fictional characters instead of his rendering in comics. Russ Fischer of /Film described the character as looking more [...] "Steve Ditko derived" [...] (the character's original artist). Webb felt that there are different incarnations of Lizard in the comic book. He felt that he should do it without the snout because he was interested more in human emotions and wanted to keep Rhys' presence in the creature. Webb wanted him to have emotion, have <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> have feeling. He stated [...] "that in a comic book, you just put that thing up there, and you can say, oh, thought bubble, whatever. But when you try to do that and make it look real, it's a different challenge, and I'm creating a movie, I'm not creating a comic book. That was part of the design." ...|$|E
500|$|Konnan {{joined the}} New World Order (nWo) on July 14, 1997. Konnan {{developed}} an increasingly hip-hop based gimmick and was nicknamed [...] "K-Dogg." [...] During his first {{stint in the}} nWo, Konnan feuded with the Luchadores whom he had brought to WCW. During this storyline, he wrestled in a Mexican Death match at Road Wild against Rey Mysterio, Jr. and a match against Juventud Guerrera at Uncensored in March 1998. When the nWo divided into two rival factions on the May 4, 1998 episode of Nitro, Konnan sided with the nWo Wolfpac, led by Kevin Nash. The Wolfpac feuded with nWo Hollywood, led by Hollywood Hogan and became tweeners. On the November 30, 1998 episode of Nitro, Konnan defeated Chris Jericho for the World Television Championship. His reign lasted until December 28, 1998, when he lost to nWo Hollywood member Scott Steiner on Nitro following interference from Buff Bagwell. When {{the two halves of}} the nWo reunited in January 1999, Konnan was thrown out of the nWo for standing up for Rey Misterio, Jr and was attacked by Lex Luger. As a result, he became <b>a</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> teamed with Misterio to fight the nWo. After feuding with nWo member Lex Luger, Konnan and Mysterio, Jr. were defeated by The Outsiders at SuperBrawl IX, with The Outsiders removing Mysterio's mask in the process. Konnan later criticized WCW for not respecting Mexican wrestling culture by writing storylines that saw several Mexican wrestlers unceremoniously unmasked (Juventud Guerrera, Psicosis, and Mysterio). He compared asking a luchador to remove their mask to [...] "going to Japan and telling the Japanese they have to eat with a fork instead of chopsticks." ...|$|E
500|$|Imperial Bedrooms also {{breaches}} {{several new}} territories. When compared to Less Than Zero, its [...] "huge shift" [...] is a technological one. The novel picks up on {{many aspects of}} the early 21st-century culture, such as Internet viral videos which depict executions. The novel reflects how technology changes the nature of interpersonal relationships. Additionally, Clay is text-stalked throughout the book; Ellis himself had been [...] "text-stalked" [...] before in real life. Ellis feels this was an unconscious exploration of the dynamics brought on by the new technology. The author also predicts that [...] "fans of Less Than Zero" [...] may [...] "feel betrayed"; Imperial Bedrooms thrust is its [...] "narrative... of exploitation". One reviewer describes the novel's [...] "central theme" [...] as [...] "Hollywood is an industry town running on exploitation", and criticizes this theme for being unoriginal in 2010. An Irish Times review notes positively however that Ellisvision of society is bleak; his dark studies of the human animal as shocking as ever." [...] The new setting poses questions, such as [...] "Is Hollywood intended as a variation of ancient Rome? Is the movie industry a coliseum?" [...] Another review found that the celebrity setting, as visited before in his novel Glamorama (1998), allows Ellis to make a number of observations about contemporary pop culture via Clay, such as when he asserts [...] "that exposure can ensure fame". Ellis comments how in Less Than Zero, Clay's passivity worked to protect him from the [...] "bleak moral landscape he was a part of", which he views as Clay's major flaw. Ellis developed this into the more unabashedly 'guilty' Clay of the new novel. Ellis says that [...] "a portrait of narcissism was the big nut that I had. Of entitlement. This imperial idea." [...] The difference he notes between this [...] "portrait of a narcissist" [...] and his earlier ones, such as American Psycho and Lunar Park, {{come in the form of}} its more moral bent: [...] "This time", Ellis comments, [...] "the narcissist reaches a dead end." [...] To one reviewer, Clay's world at its most exaggerated, in the scenes of torture, reach Huxleyan heights of dystopian fantasy, comparing Imperial Bedrooms to Brave New World (1932), [...] "where the [...] "command economy" [...] now manifests as rampant, late-capitalist consumerism, where ambien is the new soma and humans are zombies: one character's face is [...] "unnaturally smooth, redone in such a way that the eyes are shocked open with perpetual surprise; it's a face mimicking <b>a</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> it looks agonized." ...|$|E
