5|$|Unlike Eno's {{previous}} albums, {{which were}} recorded {{in a very short}} time, Before and After Science was two years in the making. During this two-year period, Eno was busy working on his solo ambient music albums Music for Films and Discreet Music. Due to the very positive critical reception accorded his previous rock music-oriented album Another Green World, Eno was afraid of repeating himself but still wanted to release <b>a</b> <b>high-quality</b> product.|$|E
5|$|From its {{headwaters}} downstream to the downstream-most {{crossing of}} the Scranton/Moosic line, the drainage basin of Stafford Meadow Brook is designated as <b>a</b> <b>High-Quality</b> Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. From that point downstream to its mouth, the stream is classified as a Warmwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. A large section of the stream from its headwaters to the lower Pennsylvania Route 307 bridge meets the criteria for an Exceptional Value designation. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the stream {{at least as far}} upstream as river mile 6.82 and as far downstream as its mouth. The stream was stocked with 500 adult and fingerling rainbow trout in 1894–1895. In 1984, the Pennsylvania Fish Commission speculated that there were native brook trout in part of the stream.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Browne {{convinced}} Ziff-Davis to try <b>a</b> <b>high-quality</b> digest fantasy magazine. Fantastic, {{which appeared}} in the summer of that year, focused on fantasy rather than science fiction and was so successful that it persuaded Ziff-Davis to switch Amazing from pulp format to digest in early 1953 (while also switching to a bimonthly schedule). Circulation fell, however, and subsequent budget cuts limited the story quality in both Amazing and Fantastic. Fantastic began to print science fiction as well as fantasy. Circulation increased as a result, but Browne, who was not a science fiction aficionado, once again lost interest in the magazines.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{watershed}} of Roaring Creek is in Columbia County, but small areas are in Montour County, Northumberland County, and Schuylkill County. More than 40 percent of {{the watershed}} is forested and nearly 40 percent is agricultural land. State game lands and state forests {{are also in the}} watershed. A total of approximately 3,500 people inhabit the watershed, as of 2000. The creek's drainage basin is <b>a</b> <b>High-Quality</b> Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery upstream of Lick Run. Downstream of Lick Run, the main stem is a Trout Stocked Fishery and Migratory Fishery. A reach of the creek above Lick Run is designated as Class A Wild Trout Waters. 31 species of fish were observed at 20 sites in the watershed in 2003 and 2004.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{critically}} acclaimed bootlegs from the 1980s is The Black Album by Prince. The album {{was to have been}} a conventional major-label release in late 1987, but on 1 December, immediately before release, Prince decided to pull the album, requiring 500,000 copies to be destroyed. A few advance copies had already shipped, which were used to create bootlegs. This eventually led to the album's official release. Towards the end of the 1980s, the Ultra Rare Trax series of bootlegs, featuring studio outtakes of the Beatles, showed that digital remastering onto compact disc could produce <b>a</b> <b>high-quality</b> product that was comparable with official studio releases.|$|E
5|$|Originally planned as a new-build route across South London, {{construction}} of {{the first section of}} the South Circular near Eltham began in 1921 to <b>a</b> <b>high-quality</b> specification. The remainder of the road was supposed to be of a similar standard but it was repeatedly delayed, and the current route was allocated in the late 1930s to existing urban streets instead. Despite several proposals to either upgrade the road or replace it with a parallel motorway, there has been little change in the century since the route was first planned and most of the road is still urban streets. The South Circular has received sustained criticism for congestion and pollution {{and is one of the}} least popular roads in Britain.|$|E

5|$|Roaring Brook is {{designated}} as <b>a</b> <b>High-Quality</b> Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery {{for part of}} its length and a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery for {{the other part of}} its length. It is also Class A Wild Trout Waters from the Hollister Dam to the Elmhurst Reservoir. Numerous macroinvertebrate taxa have been observed in the stream and boreal forest trees inhabit wetlands in the watershed. A 12-mile (19-kilometer) rail trail connecting the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail to the Poconos via the Roaring Brook Corridor has been proposed.|$|E
5|$|The {{group has}} a very long {{occupational}} history, with one house having been dated {{as far back as}} the Early Preclassic. By the Middle Preclassic, large platforms were being built from cobbles and several rich burials were made. By AD800, the complex consisted of about 50 buildings arranged around 7 major courtyards. At this time, the most important building was the House of the Bakabs, the palace of a powerful nobleman from the time of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat. The building has <b>a</b> <b>high-quality</b> sculpted exterior and a carved hieroglyphic bench inside. A portion of the group was a subdistrict occupied by non-Maya inhabitants from Central Honduras who were involved in the trade network that brought in goods from that region.|$|E
5|$|Various {{species of}} fish inhabit most of the tributaries of Catawissa Creek. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection {{considers}} eleven tributaries of the creek to be Coldwater Fisheries. Another is a Coldwater Fishery for part of its length and <b>a</b> <b>High-Quality</b> Coldwater Fishery for the other part. An additional twelve tributaries are High-Quality Coldwater Fisheries for their entire lengths. The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission considers eleven tributaries to be Class A Wild Trout Waters. Five tributaries have been observed to be devoid of fish life, and one other is suspected to lack fish as well. Most of the remaining tributaries are inhabited by between one and fourteen {{species of fish}}.|$|E

5|$|Bowman Creek's main stem is {{designated}} as <b>a</b> <b>High-Quality</b> Coldwater Fishery and the watersheds {{of all but}} two of its tributaries have the same designation. The watersheds of the remaining two tributaries, Sorber Run and Cider Run, are {{designated as}} Exceptional Value waters, with standards even higher than those of High-Quality Coldwater Fisheries. Additionally, these two tributaries are the only Wilderness Trout Streams in Wyoming County. Wild trout naturally reproduce throughout all of the creek's tributaries. A total of ten named streams in the watershed of Bowman Creek are classified by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission as Class A Wild Trout Waters. Most hold this designation for brook trout only, but Sugar Hollow Creek and a section of Roaring Run hold the designation for rainbow trout, either instead of or in addition to brook trout.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011, <b>a</b> <b>high-quality</b> {{recording}} of the Las Vegas show was uploaded to YouTube. On July 14, 2011, {{the vice president of}} Online Anti-Piracy from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), Marc McDevitt, requested a subpoena at a federal court to obtain personal details from YouTube of the user who uploaded the video, including the IP address, e-mail address and any other relevant information to identify the person. Although it is common for major music labels to send takedown requests to YouTube, it is thought to be the first time the RIAA filed legal action against the video hosting site in order to obtain the personal details of an uploader. The case was closed after a week; according to a copyright lawyer, it is most likely that the subpoena was granted by the court and that YouTube agreed to hand over the personal details that were requested. The video was removed from YouTube, but copies of the full concert can still be found on the site.|$|E
5|$|Little Catawissa Creek is {{considered}} by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be <b>a</b> <b>High-Quality</b> Coldwater Fishery between its headwaters and Reservoir Road. Between Reservoir Road and {{the mouth of the}} creek, it {{is considered}} to be a Coldwater Fishery. The upper reaches of the creek, between its headwaters and a point slightly downstream of where it enters Schuylkill County are considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class A Wild Trout Waters and the rest of the creek's length is considered to be Approved Trout Waters. The upper reaches of the creek were Class A Wild Trout Waters in 1976 before becoming Class D Wild Trout Waters in 1984. This change was due to acid mine drainage and sediment buildup. However, the creek rebounded to Class A Wild Trout Waters by 1997. The creek is considered to be Class D Wild Trout Waters between T431 and T435. The tributary Trexler Run is also considered to be Class A Wild Trout Waters throughout its length.|$|E
