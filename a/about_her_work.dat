5|$|She was an {{advocate}} for women working in roles outside offices, suggesting government grants for women {{who wanted to be}} nurses or teachers and giving lectures to parents <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>work</b> in occupational therapy in 1935. With the Soroptimist club she gave talks to her fellow members, praising the influence of Octavia Hill and explaining that she was interested more in mental health than physical health. She advocated an ordered life and a happy atmosphere for everyone.|$|E
5|$|Towards the end {{of senior}} high school, Estianty and her father began arguing <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>work</b> and poor {{performance}} at school. Estianty threatened to move out; in response, Sigit said he would support her, on the condition she continue her studies at a state university. Estianty enrolled at the University of Indonesia, first in the Dutch literature programme then in the communications programme. During this time she became a backing vocalist for Dhani's band Dewa 19; the two married in the late 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Adams filed a countersuit, {{claiming}} {{the case was}} in poor taste and frivolous, and that, as author of the Nancy Drew series, she retained the rights to her work. Although Adams had written many of the titles after 1953, and edited others, she {{claimed to be the}} author of all of the early titles. In fact, she had rewritten the older titles and was not their original author. When Mildred Benson was called to testify <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>work</b> for the Syndicate, Benson's role in writing the manuscripts of early titles was revealed in court with extensive documentation, contradicting Adams' claims to authorship. The court ruled that Grosset had the rights to publish the original series as they were in print in 1980, but did not own characters or trademarks. Furthermore, any new publishers chosen by Adams were completely within their rights to print new titles.|$|E
5|$|Gillibrand's legal {{representation}} of Philip Morris was again an issue. Her campaign finance records showed {{that she received}} $18,200 from Philip Morris employees for her 2008 campaign, putting her among the top dozen Democrats in such contributions. Questioned during the campaign <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>work</b> on behalf of Philip Morris, Gillibrand stated that she had {{voted in favor of}} all three anti-tobacco bills in that session of Congress. She said that she never hid her work for Philip Morris, and she added that as an associate at her law firm, she had had no control over which clients she worked for. The New York Times, reporting on this issue, said that Davis Polk's official policy was that associates were allowed to withdraw from representing clients about whom they had moral qualms.|$|E
5|$|Radu is {{interviewed in}} {{this portion of}} the film, as is Tournecuillert, who speaks about his {{experiences}} in Albania, where he heard about the sex trafficking of girls and how some of the girls would be shot or burned to death as a warning to the other girls. He describes how Albanian girls are often rounded up to be sexually trafficked in Italy. He further explains that, normally, before they leave Albania, the traffickers kill one of the girls in front of the others—usually by burning or shooting—to demonstrate what will happen to others who try to escape. Matei adds that, for the sake of amusement, some of the girls would be buried alive with only their heads remaining above ground. Eugenia Bonetti, a nun, speaks <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>work</b> helping girls escape from slavery in Italy.|$|E

5|$|The {{outcome of}} the case turned largely on the {{question}} of who had written the Nancy Drew series. Adams filed a countersuit, claiming that, as author of the Nancy Drew Mystery Stories, she retained the rights to her work. Although Adams had written many Nancy Drew titles after 1953 and edited others, she claimed to be the author of all of the early titles. In fact, she had rewritten the older titles, but was not the original author. When Mildred Benson, the author of the early Nancy Drew volumes, was called to testify <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>work</b> for the Syndicate, Benson's role in writing the manuscripts of early titles was revealed in court with extensive documentation, contradicting Adams' claims to authorship. The court ruled that Grosset had the rights to publish the original series of both Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys as they were in print in 1980, but did not own characters or trademarks. Furthermore, any new publishers chosen by Adams were completely within their rights to print new titles.|$|E

Although she never returned to Sweden, her years in Rome were far from happy, being hounded by debts and by opposition to <b>her</b> <b>work</b> against Church abuses. She was originally buried at San Lorenzo in Panisperna before her remains were returned to Sweden. She was canonized in the year 1391 by Pope Boniface IX, which was confirmed by the Council of Constance in 1415.

25|$|The {{knowledge}} of Mrs Davis' involvement with CRC, is found differently {{due to the}} omissions of Pamela and Eileen - Inspector Lejeune learns about CRC by having Bradley tailed, shortly after meeting Marple outside his offices, to which Marple suspects that Mrs Davis was involved with them owing to her earlier asking Mrs Coppins <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
25|$|She was whole-hearted {{not only}} <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>work</b> {{but also about}} life on Crete. She learned modern Greek, {{got to know the}} island, its people and culture and was known for her ability to get on with local workers on site. In this way, she {{can be seen as a}} pioneer of {{contemporary}} approaches to archaeological work, while she also fitted the early 20th century pattern of women assisting senior male archaeologists.|$|E
25|$|In 1934 she {{explored}} {{a variety}} of archaeological sites in the Peloponnese {{and other parts of}} mainland Greece, and returned to Crete in 1935. She continued to work in association with Pendlebury: in particular around Lasithi in central Crete. She excavated, helped publish, and also took opportunities to travel with Eccles. Some of her travel was to the Middle East and Egypt to explore links between Minoan and Oriental cultures. Although Arthur Evans' visits to Knossos had become less frequent in the 1930s, he knew enough <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>work</b> to give her the role of organising the Knossos section of a London exhibition celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the British School, and of helping with a further display at the Ashmolean. He also used one of her drawings of a hoard of axes to illustrate his last work on the palace at Knossos.|$|E

Based on the article, there are similarities between the two poets in part of their life and experiences, as well as poetry.|$|R
25|$|When Watson came to Cambridge, Crick was a 35-year-old {{graduate}} student (due {{to his work}} during WWII) and Watson was only 23, but he already had a Ph.D. They shared {{an interest in the}} fundamental problem of learning how genetic information might be stored in molecular form. Watson and Crick talked endlessly about DNA and the idea that {{it might be possible to}} guess a good molecular model of its structure. A key piece of experimentally-derived information came from X-ray diffraction images that had been obtained by Wilkins, Franklin, and Gosling. In November 1951, Wilkins came to Cambridge and shared his data with Watson and Crick. Alexander Stokes (another expert in helical diffraction theory) and Wilkins (both at King's College) had reached the conclusion that X-ray diffraction data for DNA indicated that the molecule had a helical structure—but Franklin vehemently disputed this conclusion. Stimulated by their discussions with Wilkins and what Watson learned by attending a talk given by Franklin <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>work</b> on DNA, Crick and Watson produced and showed off an erroneous first model of DNA. Their hurry to produce a model of DNA structure was driven in part by the knowledge that they were competing against Linus Pauling. Given Pauling's recent success in discovering the Alpha helix, they feared that Pauling might also be the first to determine the structure of DNA.|$|E
25|$|Florence Hawley {{was born}} in Cananea Sonora, Mexico where her father was chief chemist for a copper mine. In 1913, after the {{outbreak}} of the Mexican Revolution, her family moved to Miami, Arizona. She was introduced to archaeology at a young age from her father during his excavating of ruins around their home in southern Arizona. In 1936 Florence married archaeologist Donovan Senter; together they had a daughter named Andrea. In 1950, after a divorce from Senter, she married Bruce Ellis who was a historian. Their marriage lasted until {{the time of his death}} in 1985. She began teaching at the University of Arizona in 1929, where she was introduced to dendrochronology in a class taught by A. E. Douglass. She began teaching at the University of New Mexico fall of 1934 until she retired in 1971. It is possible that more professional anthropologists in the United States were taught by Hawley than by any other member of the profession. Even after her retirement she remained active in field research up until her death in 1991. She continued to write and excavate. She was passionate <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>work</b> and even after a broken hip returned to the field during her recuperation to supervise. She broke new ground in her research by developing and applying innovative techniques of chemical analysis, dendrochronology, ethnohistory, and Ethnoarchaeology.|$|E
500|$|A 2006 {{review by}} Simon noted that Donna lacked {{dedication}} to her job, and was easily distracted by her love life. Following an April 2008 interview with Jacobs, the itv.com website for the entertainment show This Morning observed that despite Donna's [...] "chaotic" [...] personal life, {{she had grown}} more serious <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>work.</b> Ultimately, adopting her half-niece Mia forced Donna to grow up, focussing on her career by attaining promotion to ward sister and accepting the resultant responsibilities. Reflecting on Donna's development in January 2011, Jacobs observed that she had changed {{a great deal from}} her early days, when she was used as a comical character with [...] "bumbling one-liners", into a serious, more responsible person.|$|E

500|$|Development of Gaga's third studio album, Artpop, began {{shortly after}} the release of Born This Way (2011); by the {{following}} year, its concepts were [...] "beginning to flourish" [...] as Gaga collaborated with producers Fernando Garibay and DJ White Shadow. As the singer embarked on her Born This Way Ball tour, she began collaborating with disc jockey Zedd. In October 2012, when asked by DJ Calvin Harris <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>work</b> with Zedd, Gaga sent a cryptic Twitter message: [...] "Were all good [...] miss you buddy been listening to **rq* all day". The abbreviated word was assumed to refer to a song title. About a year later, a demo from Gaga's Artpop sessions leaked with the song, entitled [...] "Burqa"; however, it was presumed to have a two-part title.|$|E
500|$|Born in Pretoria {{and raised}} in poverty in Cape Town, Ames {{became the first woman}} to receive a Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Cape Town in 1964. [...] Ames [...] studied the effects of {{cannabis}} on the brain and published several articles on the subject; seeing the therapeutic benefits of cannabis on patients in her own hospital, she became an early proponent of legalization for medicinal use. [...] She headed the neurology department at Groote Schuur Hospital before retiring in 1985, but continued to lecture at Valkenberg and Alexandra Hospital. After apartheid was finally dismantled in 1994, Ames testified at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>work</b> on the [...] "Biko doctors" [...] medical ethics inquiry. [...] In 1999, Nelson Mandela awarded Ames the Star of South Africa, the country's highest civilian award, in recognition of her work on behalf of human rights.|$|E
500|$|Her work on {{controlling}} {{elements and}} gene regulation was conceptually difficult {{and was not}} immediately understood or accepted by her contemporaries; she described the reception of her research as [...] "puzzlement, even hostility". Nevertheless, McClintock continued to develop her ideas on controlling elements. She published a paper in Genetics in 1953, where she presented all her statistical data, and undertook lecture tours to universities throughout the 1950s to speak <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>work.</b> She continued to investigate the problem and identified a new element that she called Suppressor-mutator (Spm), which, although similar to Ac/Ds, acts in a more complex manner. Like Ac/Ds, some versions could transpose {{on their own and}} some could not; unlike Ac/Ds, when present, it fully suppressed the expression of mutant genes when they normally would not be entirely suppressed. Based on the reactions of other scientists to her work, McClintock felt she risked alienating the scientific mainstream, and from 1953 stopped publishing accounts of her research on controlling elements.|$|E
50|$|Regina Silveira {{an internationally}} known Brazilian artist, works with light, shadows and distortions to explore ideas of reality.
