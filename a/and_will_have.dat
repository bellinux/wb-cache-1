5|$|A second {{effect is}} that a diver {{ascending}} to altitude, will be decompressing en route, <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> residual nitrogen until all tissues have equilibrated to the local pressures.

50|$|On 21 May 1862, having {{continued}} {{to follow the}} Warrego downstream, Landsborough's party reached a station occupied by Williams and Neilsen, and learned that Burke <b>and</b> <b>Wills</b> <b>had</b> perished.

They were traditionally captured with traps and lassos, but since 1950, tranquillisers have been used.|$|E

5|$|Previously {{the police}} used a {{decentralized}} {{information technology system}} developed during the mid-1990s. As late as 2012 servers were still being run with Windows NT 4.0 from 1996 and log-on times were typically twenty minutes. The new IT-system D#2 was introduced in 2011 <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> been taken into use by all divisions by 2012. D#2 will be operated by ErgoGroup <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> two redundant server centers. Personnel {{have access to the}} system via thin clients. The police have a system to raise a national alarm to close border crossings and call in reserve personnel. The one time it was activated the message was not received by any of the intended recipients. Since 2009 it has been possible to report criminal damage and theft of wallets, bicycles and mobile telephones without a known perpetrator(s) online.|$|E
5|$|Qualcomm {{unveiled}} its next-gen Snapdragon 835 flagship SoC on November 17, 2016, {{which will}} be built by Samsung using its 10-nanometer FinFET process.

Due to Samsung's role in manufacturing the chip, its mobile division also acquired the initial inventory of the chip.

A 2D cartoonish avatar version of Sora wearing his original outfit in Kingdom Hearts is {{also present in}} the online community-based social gaming networking service, Kingdom Hearts Mobile.

Sora also appears in the Shiro Amano's manga and Tomoko Kanemaki's novels in which he reprises {{his role in the}} video games.|$|E
5|$|A high {{accident}} rate may also occur because Thoroughbreds, {{particularly in the}} United States, are first raced as 2-year-olds, well before they are completely mature. Though they may appear full-grown and are in superb muscular condition, their bones are not fully formed. However, catastrophic injury rates are higher in 4- and 5-year-olds than in 2- and 3-year-olds. Some believe that correct, slow training of a young horse (including foals) may actually be beneficial to the overall soundness of the animal. This is because, during the training process, microfractures occur in the leg followed by bone remodeling. If the remodeling is given sufficient time to heal, the bone becomes stronger. If proper remodeling occurs before hard training and racing begins, the horse will have a stronger musculoskeletal system <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> a decreased chance of injury.|$|E
5|$|In the Soviet times, mental {{hospitals}} were frequently created in former monasteries, barracks, and even concentration camps. Sofia Dorinskaya, {{a human rights}} activist and psychiatrist, says she saw former convicts who {{have been living in}} a Russian mental hospital for ten years <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> been staying there until their dying day because of having no home. Deinstitutionalization has not touched many of the hospitals, and persons still die inside them. In 2013, 70 persons died in a fire just outside Novgorod and Moscow. Living conditions are often insufficient and sometimes horrible: 12 to 15 patients in a big room with bars on the windows, no bedside tables, often no partitions, not enough toilets. The number of outpatient clinics designed for the primary care of the mentally disordered stopped increasing in 2005 and was reduced to 277 in 2012 as against 318 in 2005. Stigma linked to mental disease is at the level of xenophobia. The Russian public perceive the mentally sick as harmful, useless, incurable, and dangerous. The social stigma is maintained not only by the general public but also by psychiatrists.|$|E

5|$|There {{are seven}} types of {{units in the}} game. Each unit has a set of {{statistics}} which is displayed in the interface once selected. The statistics range from combat strength, fatigue, efficiency, supply and movement points. During the game, both sides {{have the option to}} request air support {{that can be used to}} attack enemy units. If the other side uses their air support, the player will be given a warning of an oncoming air strike <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> the option to retreat. The game has two endings depending on the side chosen. If playing as NATO, the main objective is to stall Soviet forces long enough until American reinforcements arrive. However, if playing as the Warsaw Pact, the objective is to destroy all NATO forces.|$|E
5|$|They {{discover}} that an unknown source of Eichner radiation {{is causing the}} growth. Separately, Ian (R.J. Williams), now appearing as an eight-year-old, confides to Troi {{that he is the}} source of the crew's problems <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> to leave. Troi realizes Ian is dying and calls for medical assistance. As Pulaski tries to keep Ian alive, Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) scans him and discovers that he is the source of radiation. Ian dies in Troi's arms, and turns into a ball of energy, which settles into Troi's hands, communicating telepathically with her for a moment, then leaves the ship. The lifeform told her that he wished to learn about humans through experiencing standard human development and living among the crew. With Ian gone, the plague sample returns to normal and the crew continues on their mission.|$|E

In June, Oliver had resigned from Lassiter's <b>and</b> <b>Will</b> <b>had</b> inherited his 49%. In October, Will contacted Elle through his lawyer, Tim Collins (Ben Anderson). Tim told Elle that she could work for the Barnes Corporation <b>and</b> she <b>and</b> <b>Will</b> could be business partners, Lassiter's stockholders (at that point <b>Will</b> <b>had</b> 51% <b>and</b> Elle had 49%) - on one condition.
