25|$|Upon {{ultraviolet}} (UV) radiation in {{the presence}} of oxygen, chloroform slowly converts into phosgene by a radical reaction. To suppress this photodegradation, chloroform is often stored in brown-tinted glass containers. Chlorinated compounds used to remove oil from metals, such as <b>automotive</b> brake <b>cleaners,</b> are converted to phosgene by the UV rays of arc welding processes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{a finite}} element model of an <b>automotive</b> air <b>cleaner</b> is established. Through the free modal {{analysis}} of this FEA model, combined with Modal Testing which modified the FEA model, different order modal frequency and modal characteristics are acquired, which supply the reference standard for dynamic design. According to the analysis, the local unreasonable structure will be optimized...|$|R
50|$|At Corning Glass Works, Lachman was {{a member}} of the team that invented the first inexpensive, mass producible {{catalytic}} converter for automobiles operating internal combustion engines. In addition to Irwin Lachman, the team consisted of engineer Rodney Bagley and geologist Ronald Lewis.While working at Corning, Irwin Lachman co-invented the ceramic substrate found almost in all catalytic converters. The catalytic converters provide <b>cleaner</b> <b>automotive</b> emissions, which greatly reduce the amount harmful pollutants.|$|R
40|$|The Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA), {{enacted in}} 1990, called for <b>cleaner</b> <b>automotive</b> fuels {{in order to}} upgrade air quality. This {{appeared}} to provide new market potential for ethanol, which is obtained from corn grown in the midwestern United States, and which is already in large-scale use in a blend of ten percent ethanol to ninety percent gasoline. The CAAA left specific details of the clean fuels program {{to be worked out}} by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in consultation with the interested parties...|$|R
40|$|Abstract − This {{paper will}} present metrology’s role on air {{pollution}} control in Brazil, the benefits for society and how Inmetro’s Legal Metrology Directorate (Dimel, in its Portuguese acronym) is developing this work. Automotive vehicles are very significant air pollution source in Brazil [1]. To change this situation, two years later the Federal Government established the Automotive Vehicles Air Pollution Control Program (Proconve, in its Portuguese acronym), providing to the car manufacturers a gradual schedule {{to the implementation of}} <b>cleaner</b> <b>automotive</b> technologies on new vehicles. Today the exhaust emissions reduction for these vehicles is up to 97 % [2]. For in-use vehicles, Proconve demanded to all Brazilian states the implementation of an Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) Program. At least once a year these vehicles should be submitted to an I/M authority to check its general conditions and to measure its exhaust emissions. The emissions measurement is performed with two different instruments: gas analyzers (for spark ignition engines) and opacimeters (for Diesel engines). Both instruments are under legal metrological control and are submitted to type evaluation and verification, performed b...|$|R
