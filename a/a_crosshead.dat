2500|$|The back-acting engine, {{also known}} as the return {{connecting}} rod engine, was another engine designed to have a very low profile. The back-acting engine was in effect a modified steeple engine, laid horizontally across the keel of a ship rather than standing vertically above it. Instead of the triangular crosshead assembly found in a typical steeple engine however, the back-acting engine generally utilized a set of two or more elongated, parallel piston rods terminating in <b>a</b> <b>crosshead</b> to perform the same function. The term [...] "back-acting" [...] or [...] "return connecting rod" [...] derives {{from the fact that the}} connecting rod [...] "returns" [...] or comes back from the side of the engine opposite the engine cylinder to rotate a centrally located crankshaft.|$|E
2500|$|The steeple engine, {{sometimes}} referred to as a [...] "crosshead" [...] engine, was an early attempt to break away from the beam concept common to both the walking beam and side-lever types, {{and come up with a}} smaller, lighter, more efficient design. In a steeple engine, the vertical oscillation of the piston is not converted to a horizontal rocking motion as in a beam engine, but is instead used to move an assembly, composed of <b>a</b> <b>crosshead</b> and two rods, through a vertical guide at the top of the engine which in turn rotates the crankshaft connecting rod below. In early examples of the type, the crosshead assembly was rectangular in shape, but over time it was refined into an elongated triangle. The triangular assembly above the engine cylinder gives the engine its characteristic [...] "steeple" [...] shape, hence the name.|$|E

5000|$|There is however a later medieval cross by the crossroads. It {{consists}} of <b>a</b> medieval <b>crosshead</b> placed on <b>a</b> modern rough hewn shaft {{which has been}} set into a medieval [...] slab base.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Crossheads</b> in <b>a</b> steam {{locomotive}} can be mounted either to one guide mounted above the crosshead or to two, one above and one below (called <b>an</b> alligator <b>crosshead</b> {{since it has}} two [...] "jaws"). The former was preferred in many modern locomotives.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the early}} 1960s, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory {{developed}} a maser to provide ultra-low-noise amplification of S-band microwave signals received from deep space probes. This maser used deeply refrigerated hydrogen to chill the amplifier {{down to a}} temperature of four kelvin. Amplification was achieved by exciting a ruby comb with a 12.0 gigahertz klystron. In the early years, it took days to chill and remove the impurities from the hydrogen lines. Refrigeration was a two-stage process with a large Linde unit on the ground, and <b>a</b> <b>crosshead</b> compressor within the antenna. The final injection was at [...] through a [...] micrometer-adjustable entry to the chamber. The whole system noise temperature looking at cold sky (2.7 kelvins in the microwave band) was 17 kelvins. This gave such a low noise figure that the Mariner IV space probe could send still pictures from Mars back to the Earth even though the output power of its radio transmitter was only 15 watts, and hence the total signal power received was only -169 decibels {{with respect to a}} milliwatt (dBm).|$|E

50|$|The Vauclain {{compound}} was {{a type of}} compound {{steam locomotive}} that was briefly popular around 1900.

5000|$|Development of {{experimental}} steam engined paddle boats by William Symington had halted when the sponsor, Patrick Miller of Dalswinton, abandoned the project.

50|$|Other compact {{alternatives}} to the return connecting rod or trunk engines were Maudslay's siamese engine and the rare annular piston engine. Like the trunk engine, these placed the gudgeon pin within {{the length of the}} piston stroke by having a pair of pistons and <b>a</b> T-shaped <b>crosshead</b> that could relocate the gudgeon pin behind its usual position.|$|R
40|$|In {{determining}} the fracture toughness {{of a test}} specimen, standards currently require either locally-measured load-line displacements or clip gage displacements. In order to measure these parameters, secondary sensors generally need to be installed and calibrated, which often comes at a higher cost. <b>As</b> <b>crosshead</b> displacements are automatically measured in most modern material test machines, use of the crosshead measurements alone would be less expensive. Although much criticism exists on the accuracy of this approach in determining CTOD values, the method can still prove sufficiently accurate for many applications. The current paper aims to assess {{the magnitude of the}} errors that arise from using the crosshead displacement in fracture mechanics testing of steels with the Single Edge Notched Bending (SENB) specimen geometry. The results show that for steels with sufficiently large toughness, the use of the crosshead displacement to calculate J and convert to CTOD produces results within 10 % of calculating the CTOD directly with conventional techniques...|$|R

50|$|The {{ship was}} powered {{by one of}} the largest two stroke diesel engines of its time. Its {{cylinders}} were of the double-acting type, in which combustion takes place both above and below the piston. This required the use of <b>a</b> <b>crosshead.</b>|$|E
50|$|Steam engines {{after this}} are usually double-acting: their {{internal}} pressure works {{on each side}} of the piston in turn. This requires a seal around the piston rod and so the hinge between the piston and connecting rod is placed outside the cylinder, in a large sliding bearing block called <b>a</b> <b>crosshead.</b>|$|E

[...] School of Dentistry. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2012 This study evaluated effects of refrigerant spray and crosshead speed on orthodontic composite resin shear debond strength and Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI) after bond failure. Orthodontic brackets were bonded to forty paired extracted mandibular third molars. Pairs {{were divided into}} experimental and control groups, with and without refrigerant spray prior to debond, respectively. Each group was further divided into two subgroups based on crosshead speed of 1 or 10 mm/min. Bracket shear debond strength was tested with a universal testing machine and ARI scores assessed. Results showed {{no statistically significant difference}} for shear debond strength or ARI score as a function of refrigerant spray usage. Statistically significant differences were shown for shear debond strength and ARI score as <b>a</b> function of <b>crosshead</b> speed. <b>As</b> <b>crosshead</b> speed increased, shear debond strength and ARI score both increased. These results indicate that application of refrigerant spray prior to bracket debonding is not beneficial.

50|$|They {{were built}} with Hendrie’s steam reversers. The Hendrie steam {{reversing}} gear {{consisted of a}} 5+1/2 in diameter steam cylinder and a 5 in diameter oil cylinder, arranged in line on a bracket which was fixed to the main engine frame on the driver's side. The cylinders had a common piston rod which had a slot in the centre, between the cylinders. This slot accommodated <b>a</b> sliding <b>crosshead</b> which engaged with an arm fixed to the reversing shaft.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two major}} types of dies used in overjacketing extrusion, both based on <b>an</b> overall <b>crosshead</b> design. Regardless of die type used, the polymer melt is often {{extruded}} at a rate less {{than the speed of}} the bare wire that is drawn through the die, typically on the order of 1-4 times the speed of the melt. This causes the polymer jacket to extend, thin, and tighten around the central wire, increasing adhesion of the new layer.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of the steam engine, <b>a</b> <b>crosshead</b> is {{essential}} if the engine is to be double acting - steam is applied to both sides of the piston, which requires a seal around the piston rod. An exception is the oscillating cylinder steam engine which can be double acting and yet has no crosshead.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} {{flat-twin}} engines with one crank pin shared by both connecting rods, thereby {{have only one}} crank throw. An experimental aircraft engine built before 1910 by Richard Pearse in New Zealand had both pistons and both connecting rods {{as part of a}} single rigid assembly that drove the crankpin through a sliding bearing contained within <b>a</b> <b>crosshead.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some {{variations}} of the opposed piston or OP designs use a single crankshaft. The Gobron-Brillié, and Doxford ship engines used a crankshaft {{at one end of}} the cylinders and <b>a</b> <b>crosshead</b> for the opposing piston. The crank throws for each end were often unequal giving a shorter motion for the end having the higher reciprocating weight in order to help balance.|$|E
40|$|In the {{construction}} of post-tensioned segmental crosshead, the stresses in the crosshead vary in every stage of {{the construction}} as the addition of new segment increases the bending moment while post-tensioning of tendon reduces it. Furthermore, the bending moment in the crosshead during construction is not balanced as new segment are added at {{one side of the}} cantilever at a time together with other construction load that operates {{on the same side of}} the new segment. In this paper, a study was conducted with finite element method to investigate the response of various parameters and effect of construction sequences on <b>a</b> segmental <b>crosshead</b> erected by balanced cantilever method. For this operation, <b>a</b> segmental <b>crosshead</b> model was generated using a finite element software and it was analyzed with various construction sequence. The rate of changes in stresses in each stages of construction was investigated and it was found that the stresses were over the limit when construction stage analysis was performed. In addition to that, it was also found that the maximum design moment for pier design can only be obtained by a more rigorous construction stage analysis...|$|R
25|$|The locomotive's two {{cylinders}} {{were inside}} the frame and it was equipped with Stephenson valve gear. Its two feedwater pumps were actuated by the piston <b>crossheads.</b> <b>As</b> built, the engine had an open cab, but a cab roof was installed some years later.|$|R
50|$|Early steam {{engineers}} {{were convinced that}} horizontal cylinders would suffer excessive wear, owing to {{the weight of the}} piston riding on the bore of the cylinder. Vertical cylinders remained a favourite for some years. When horizontal cylinders were adopted, one measure used to carry the piston weight was to have an extended or second piston rod {{on the other side of}} the piston. This emerged through a second stuffing box and in rare cases (illus.) was supported by <b>a</b> second <b>crosshead.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first {{recorded}} {{example of a}} grasshopper beam was William Murdoch's model steam carriage of 1784. The beam offered negligible mechanical advantage and {{appears to have been}} used primarily instead of <b>a</b> <b>crosshead,</b> for what was effectively a return connecting rod engine. The American engineer Oliver Evans drew a high-pressure marine grasshopper engine in 1801, and in 1805 built the Oruktor Amphibolos, an amphibious dredger.|$|E
50|$|Typical {{applications}} are in fixing a crank to its crankshaft, as in a bicycle, or a piston rod to <b>a</b> <b>crosshead,</b> as in a steam engine. Note: {{the angle of}} the wedge determines the position of the parts being held, therefore on a bicycle the pedal arms will only be at 180 degrees to each other if {{the angle of the}} cotter pin's wedge is the same on both pins.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>crosshead</b> die {{splits the}} melt flow in {{two at the}} {{manifold}} inlet, recombining them at {{the opposite side of}} a cylindrical center mandrel. This relatively simple design results in non-symmetrical flow, as molecules take longer to reach the opposite side than the close side of the mandrel. As such, the resulting film will not be of uniform thickness. To reduce this nonuniformity, inlet diameters can be varied, and various inserts can be added to minimize stagnant regions.|$|E
50|$|The two motors were {{mounted in}} half height in the {{locomotive}} frame. Those two motors drove big cogwheels over sprockets spring-loaded on both sides. Each {{of those big}} cogwheels drove a jackshaft. The two jackshafts drove a shared slit coupling rod which drove - over <b>a</b> vertical <b>crosshead</b> - the crank pin of the center drive-axle. Side rods connected to the slit coupling rod transmitted the force to the outer drive-wheels.This drive concept was later used at the Ae 3/6 II.|$|R
