5|$|Despite such hostility {{between the}} brownshirts and the regular army, Blomberg <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{military}} saw the SA {{as a source}} of raw recruits for an enlarged and revitalised army. Röhm, however, wanted to eliminate the generalship of the Prussian aristocracy altogether, using the SA to become the core of a new German military. Limited by the Treaty of Versailles to one hundred thousand soldiers, army leaders watched anxiously as membership in the SA surpassed three million men by the beginning of 1934. In January 1934, Röhm presented Blomberg with a memorandum demanding that the SA replace the regular army as the nation's ground forces, and that the Reichswehr become a training adjunct to the SA.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, the Media Research Center (MRC) began {{monitoring}} {{the entertainment industry}} for alleged liberal bias through its Entertainment Division and newsletter TV, etc. MRC founder and president L.

The PTC began operations in 1995 following private planning meetings with Charlton Heston, Michael Medved, <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> entertainment industry, who would eventually make up the Advisory Board of the PTC. After the release of its first annual Family Guide to Prime-Time Television following the 1995-1996 television season, the PTC hoped to hold the entertainment industry accountable for the indecency that it perceived to be prominent on prime-time television. By 1996, the organization {{had the support of}} several members of the U.S. Congress, including Joe Lieberman and Lamar S. Smith, and an estimated annual budget of $142,000.|$|E
