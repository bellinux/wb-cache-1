40|$|Many <b>agricultural</b> {{communication}} of <b>journalism</b> programs offer publication production opportunities {{as a way}} for students to use their writing, editing, design, and photography skills. This study evaluated the curriculum and make-up of student publications produced through these <b>agricultural</b> communication or <b>journalism</b> programs.

Data were collected through a questionnaire sent to members of the Academic Programs Speical Interest Group in the Association for Communication Excellence. Fifteen programs identified offering a student-produced publication. The majority of these publications (n= 8) were offered as a course in an <b>agricultural</b> communication or <b>journalism</b> program, while five programs developed their publications as an extracurricular activity.

(March 2013) Casey Meadows Department of Agriculture Texas A&M University Research Advisor: Dr. Billy McKim Department of Agricultural Leadership, Education and Communications As an {{institution}} {{charged with the}} responsibility of educating those whom attend, the Department of Agriculture at Texas A&M University examines the desire of students to incorporate technology alongside traditional classroom instruction. The study sought to see what students find useful or difficult to utilize in current popular mobile applications on smart devices, such as the Blackberry, iPad, iPhone, Android devices, and even the iPod Touch in some instances. The study was conducted through a mixed methods approach consisting of a small focus group of <b>Agricultural</b> Communications and <b>Journalism</b> students at Texas A&M University to collect qualitative data and preferences. The focus group was later followed up by an extensive online questionnaire distributed to all <b>Agricultural</b> Communications and <b>Journalism</b> majors and minors at Texas A&M University in order to collect quantitative data concerning smart device ownership percentages, usage ratios, and personal preferences and expectations. Students had an overwhelmingly positive desire for a mobile application to be used alongside courses.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} photographs used in Time, Newsweek, and U. S. News & World Report {{in stories}} about biotechnology and food safety issues in 2000 and 2001. Semiotic theory provided {{a framework for}} a quantitative methodology to determine the messages conveyed by photographs and to group the photos by subject matter. Through an evaluation of 45 images, this research found that the news magazines had relatively balanced coverage of the issues. Five categories of images were determined {{to be used by}} the news magazines. These results are consistent with research in journalism about the use of images to create perceptions and support stereotypes. Based on the results of this study, <b>agricultural</b> communications and <b>journalism</b> programs should emphasize visual media literacy. Media literacy is also important for media outlets generating or providing agricultural photos. It is also important for news outlets to evaluate their use of photographs as supporting stereotypes or influencing public perception rather than providing objective information...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} Texas Public Relations Association (TPRA) members' perception of the word agriculture and how that perception influences perceptions of the skills and qualifications of graduates from <b>agricultural</b> communications and <b>journalism</b> (AGCJ) programs. A researcher-developed electronic questionnaire was used for data collection. Of accessible population of 148 TPRA members, 83 responded to the questionnaire, yielding a response rate of 56. 08 %. This descriptive study found that TPRA members did not have a negative perception of agriculture or the AGCJ major, but there was a lack of awareness of the AGCJ major and respondents had low self-perceived agricultural knowledge. Writing, interpersonal skills, public relations, editing, and media relations were considered to be the five most important skills in the public relations profession; however, AGCJ graduates were perceived to be only somewhat competent in these skills. Respondents ranked AGCJ as seventh of eight majors according to how well prepared graduates were perceived to be for entry-level public relations positions. Results indicated a positive correlation between awareness of the AGCJ major and perception of the major; therefore, the lack of awareness influenced the less positive perception of the major...|$|R

50|$|Theoretically speaking, {{agricultural}} {{communication is}} an applied theoretical field. The academic curriculum and scholarly endeavors typically {{stay within the}} context of agriculture, natural resources, and occasionally, the life sciences. It examines communication and human dimension issues as they relate to a variety of issues in agriculture and natural resources. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>journalism</b> is not always differentiated from agricultural communications in research. One could argue that when research focuses on media coverage of agricultural issues or when it examines issues within <b>agricultural</b> <b>journalism</b> specifically (i.e., what influences editors of agriculture magazines to publish risk information), then it is more within the realm of <b>agricultural</b> <b>journalism.</b> Journalism is often seen as a subset of communication that is supposed to be fair and balanced like traditional journalism, whereas the broader field of agricultural communication could potentially be viewed as advocacy communication.|$|E
