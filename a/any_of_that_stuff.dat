500|$|Ruck had {{previously}} auditioned for the Bender role in The Breakfast Club which went to Judd Nelson, but Hughes remembered Ruck and cast {{him as the}} 17-year-old Cameron Frye. According to Hughes, the character of Cameron was largely based on {{a friend of his}} in high school. [...] "He was sort of a lost person. His family neglected him, so he took that as license to really pamper himself. When he was legitimately sick, he actually felt good, because it was difficult and tiring to have to invent diseases but when he actually had something, he was relaxed." [...] Ruck said the role of Cameron had originally been offered to Emilio Estevez who turned it down. [...] "Every time I see Emilio, I want to kiss him", said Ruck. [...] "Thank you!" [...] Ruck, then 29, worried about the age difference. [...] "I was worried that I'd be 10 years out of step, and I wouldn't know anything about what was cool, what was hip, all that junk. But when I was going to high school, I didn't know <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> then, either. So I just thought, well, hell—I'll just be me. The character, he's such a loner that he really wouldn't give a damn about that stuff anyway. He'd feel guilty that he didn't know it, but that's it." [...] Ruck was not surprised to find himself cast young. [...] "No, because, really, when I was 18, I sort of looked 12", he said. [...] "Maybe it's a genetic imbalance." ...|$|E

This, however, did not unduly upset our youthful members who strove all the more to achieve their aims and ideals. By 1946 the membership had grown from thirty to seventy, but, as yet the club had failed to win a title in either hurling or football. However, in the same year the City Division Junior Hurling Championship was won, a historic first and no mean achievement in three years of existence. During this period also, minor teams were fielded but without much success. Training for matches was a problem without a club ground. During this period training took place in such diverse locations as the Lee Fields, Rivers town, The Fair Field, and Browns Field, which was located near the present day Church of the Ascension in Gurranabraher.|$|R
5000|$|Turn {{the volume}} up loud enough while {{listening}} to opening track ‘Siisx’ and you’ll hear unmistakable white noise. A mistake or recording problem? Not likely, nothing is an accident with these two virtuosos. Clicks, taps, clacks and taps skitter across the soundscape as Ryuichi’s expertly knocks away at the ebony and ivory. Don’t be surprised if you feel your throat tighten and a frosty sensation spread through your anterior lobes. Music? Art? Whatever it is this is less about listening and more about feeling. ... This isn’t by any means an album to let loose and rock out to. In fact it is a refreshing change from all the electro sounds Tiefschwarz et al are dressing up as click, glitch and minimal. Play this at a party and you’ll be hung, drawn and quartered but turn it up at the next {{annual meeting of the}} chin strokers society and you’ll be hailed a hero. By all means listen to this CD numerous times but just be careful because there is a reason the album is only three songs long. <b>Any</b> more <b>of</b> this cleverly crafted masterpiece and you’d never want to waste your time with <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> other <b>stuff</b> posing as music.|$|R

The wooden dining-room stuck out over the mud of the shore like a lacustrine dwelling; the planks of the floor seemed rotten; a decrepit old waiter tottered pathetically to and fro before an antediluvian and worm-eaten sideboard; the chipped plates might have been disinterred from some kitchen midden near an inhabited lake; and the chops recalled times more ancient still. They brought forcibly to one's mind the night of ages when the primeval man, evolving the first rudiments of cookery from his dim consciousness, scorched lumps of flesh at a fire of sticks in the company of other good fellows; then, gorged and happy, sat him back among the gnawed bones to tell his artless tales of experience--the tales of hunger and hunt--and of women, perhaps! ...|$|E

500|$|McCain {{was almost}} killed on board Forrestal on July 29, 1967. [...] While the air wing was {{preparing}} to launch attacks, a Zuni rocket from an F-4 Phantom accidentally fired across the carrier's deck. [...] The rocket struck either McCain's A-4E Skyhawk or one near it. The impact ruptured the Skyhawk's fuel tank, which ignited the fuel and knocked two bombs loose. [...] McCain later said, [...] "I thought my aircraft exploded. Flames were everywhere." [...] McCain escaped from his jet by climbing out of the cockpit, working himself to {{the nose of the}} jet, and jumping off its refueling probe onto the burning deck. His flight suit caught on fire as he rolled through the flames, but he was able to put it out. [...] He went to help another pilot trying to escape the fire when the first bomb exploded; McCain was thrown backwards ten feet (three meters) and suffered minor wounds when struck in the legs and chest by fragments. McCain helped crewmen throw unexploded bombs overboard off the hangar deck elevator, then went to Forrestals ready room and with other pilots watched the ensuing fire and the fire-fighting efforts on the room's closed-circuit television. The fire killed 134sailors, injured scores of others, destroyed at least 20aircraft, and took 24hours to control. [...] In Saigon a day after the conflagration, McCain praised the heroism of enlisted men who gave their lives trying to save the pilots on deck, and told New York Times reporter R. W. Apple, Jr., [...] "It's a difficult thing to say. But now that I've seen what the bombs and the napalm did to the people on our ship, I'm not so sure that I want to drop <b>any</b> more <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> on North Vietnam." [...] But such a change of course was unlikely; as McCain added, [...] "I always {{wanted to be in the}} Navy. I was born into it and I never really considered another profession. But I always had trouble with the regimentation." ...|$|R
5000|$|Florian {{took on a}} partner, another {{licensed}} engineer Florian later bought out, {{and together}} they built a makeshift studio in the unheated attic above the ballroom of the Midwest Hotel, at Hamlin and Madison. On July 9, 1955, the station came on the air, billing itself as [...] "Chicago's FM Voice of Variety." [...] It broadcast mostly jazz, show tunes, and easy listening from five to midnight seven days a week. WNIB's frequency, 97.1 Megahertz, had been abandoned in 1953 by WBBM-FM, which moved over to 96.3 MHz, a frequency formerly occupied by WBIK, a background music station owned by the Balaban & Katz movie theater chain. (WBIK was forced off the air when the United Paramount Theaters, which owned Balaban and Katz, merged with the ABC Network and the new company ABC-Paramount found itself owning two FM radio stations in the same city: WBIK and WENR-FM. Owning more than one radio station in the same spectrum {{was at the time}} against FCC station ownership rules.)Among the first announcers was Bill Gershon, then an undergraduate at Roosevelt University who was curious about radio stations. [...] "It was very much a neighborhood station with a low-power 3,000-watt transmitter," [...] he remembers, [...] "and the antenna was bolted to the hotel's flagpole." [...] Florian, a jazz aficionado, also hired Dick Buckley (who was later a DJ at WBEZ) {{to take care of the}} jazz portion of the musical menu.It was Gershon who came up with the idea of filling the Sunday-evening 5 p.m.-to-midnight slot with freebie records sent in by classical labels. [...] "Classical music wasn't part of our programming at first," [...] he says, [...] "since most other FM stations aired lots of classical music, especially WFMT and WEFM. But I told Bill we should make use of the 12 records we had in the library. He said, 'All right. Just don't have <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> ivory-tower <b>stuff</b> here.'" [...] So Gershon ushered in what he calls WNIB's [...] "friendly, low-key, no-pontification" [...] style. By early 1957 he was gone, but classical music remained a fixture at the station. In fact, it began creeping into the weekday programs, though Florian says it was a tough sell.|$|R

500|$|The {{production}} team used new technology called a [...] "breakway windshield," [...] {{as well as}} air cannons to eject the stuntwoman, Melissa Stubbs, from the vehicle.

The stuntwoman rehearsed with a helmet on, but took it off when the scene {{was ready to be}} shot. She wore a small backpad, a mouthguard, and some kneepads, and used her elbows to break the windshield upon being ejected.
