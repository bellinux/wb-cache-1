Of the 1,029 voters surveyed, 70% wanted Dodd {{to drop out of the}} presidential race, and 55% said he was spending too much time on the campaign trail. In response, Dodd's national press secretary, Colleen Flanagan, said [...] "Connecticut voters <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> look at Senator Dodd in a different light than in past years" [...] adding that once voters become more focused on the presidential race, they will look to Dodd as [...] "a candidate who has a track record of proven results." ...|$|E

Later that year, prominent Aboriginal Australian Charles Perkins and Jones clashed in a live TV and radio debate. Jones said Australians are [...] "getting no say when [...] say this is [...] nation; it's not, it's Australia's nation... <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> pay taxes to fund people who are seeking title to productive land to which they've made no contribution to its productivity".

2500|$|Only months old, the Reagan Administration {{announced}} {{its plans to}} sell five of the U.S.-made AWACS to Saudi Arabia. The proposal, part of the largest foreign arms sale ever was not received warmly on Capitol Hill where Congressional consent was required. The AWACS proposal was also harshly rejected by Israel and disapproved of {{by a majority of}} Americans. Upon formal introduction of the AWACS proposal to Congress in the fall of 1981, many Senators reacted coldly. [...] "This {{is one of the worst}} and most dangerous arms sales ever," [...] proclaimed Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy. Senator Donald Riegle said, [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> submit to a kind of blackmail; the price gouging of oil." [...] These Senators feared that the AWACS sale was not designed to promote stability, as would be claimed by the Administration, but to secure U.S. oil resources. Such a deal would mean technology for oil access, and as Kennedy said, a potentially dangerous deal at that. Senator Bob Packwood, who as a Republican was a member of Reagan’s party, was also a leader of opposition to the AWACS deal in the Senate. Packwood spelled out the danger he saw in arming Saudi Arabia: [...] "They have displayed a hostility that must be interpreted as their deliberate intentions to promote continued instability in the Middle East." [...] Packwood questioned the choice of Saudi Arabia as an arbiter of peace saying, [...] "Let’s think about which nations have been seriously committed to negotiating peace in the Middle East and which have not shared that commitment." [...] With the recently ended American hostage crisis in Iran fresh in mind, Americans were reluctant to sell military equipment to anyone. In fact, a May 1981 poll showed that 52% of those surveyed opposed arms sales to any country, and only 19% wanted the U.S. to sell AWACS to Saudi Arabia.|$|E

6000|$|I {{who have}} lived {{most of my time}} on a farm for many years, in daily contact with farmer and labourer, do really {{appreciate}} what variety and depth of knowledge is wanted for good farming. It is a lesson to the armchair reformer to watch a farmer walking across the [...] "home meadow" [...] whence he can see a good way over his land. One can feel the slow wisdom working in his head. A halt, a look this way and that, a whistle, the call of some instruction so vernacular that only a native could understand; the contemplation of sheep, beasts, sky, crops; always something being noted, and shrewd deductions made therefrom. It is a great art, and, like all art, to be learned only with the sweat of the brow and a long, minute attention to innumerable details. You cannot play at farming, and you cannot [...] "mug it up." [...] One understands the contempt of the farmer born and bred for the book-skilled gentleman who tries to instruct his grandmother in the sucking of eggs. The farmer's knowledge, acquired through years of dumb wrestling with Nature, in his own particular corner, is his strength and--his weakness. Vision of the land at large, of its potentialities, and its needs is almost of necessity excluded. The practical farmers of our generation might well be likened unto sailing-ship seamen in an age when it has suddenly become needful to carry commerce by steam. They are pupils of the stern taskmaster bankruptcy; the children of the years from 1874-1897, when the nation had turned its thumb down on British farmers, and left them to fight, unaided, against extinction. They have been brought up to carry on against contrary winds and save themselves as best they could. Well, they have done it; and now they <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> reverse their processes in the interests of a country which left them in the lurch. Naturally they are not yet persuaded that the country will not leave them in the lurch again.|$|E
