Therefore, water in the form of ice, must, over geological time-scales, have left in the upper martian surface (m-scale) at mid- and low-latitudes, leaving sorption water as a possible physical form of unstable subsurface <b>water.</b> <b>Adsorption</b> <b>water</b> is "liquid-like" at these temperatures (in the sense of a 2 D-liquid).

The KWW function has two parameters: the characteristic relaxation time and a parameter related to the dispersion of the relaxation time. Both parameters and the relaxation modulus at time 10 s, E(10), could be separated into three regions corresponding to moisture contents of 0 – 0. 05, 0. 05 – 0. 10, and greater than 0. 10.

40|$|Sorption {{water is}} a constitutent of {{the soul of the}} upper meters of the Martian surface at mid- and low latitudes (Möhlmann, 2004). This water content can {{regionally}} reach values of about 16 wt% (Feldman et al., 2003, Mitrofanov et al., 2003). <b>Adsorption</b> <b>water,</b> the physisorbed part of sorption water, can exist in a liquid-like state at temperatures down to - 40 ° C and less. The terrestrial counterpart is the "unfrozen water" in permafrost (Anderson and Tice, 1972). It has partially modified physical, chemical and biological properties if compared to dry frozen soil.

30|$|The {{results also}} show that the {{specific}} surface area determined by <b>water</b> <b>adsorption</b> is higher than that obtained by nitrogen adsorption. Effectively, because of larger radius than water molecules, nitrogen molecules are adsorbed mainly into mesoporous spaces but do not easily enter the intra-layer spaces. This difference between nitrogen <b>adsorption</b> and <b>water</b> <b>adsorption</b> was already addressed by De Belie et al. (2010) who {{also found that the}} BET specific surface area measured by nitrogen adsorption is lower than that measured by <b>water</b> <b>adsorption.</b> According to the authors, {{it is possible that the}} nitrogen molecules can not enter the spaces between C–S–H inter-layers and therefore do not cover all of the anfractuosities in this porous domain. However, to our knowledge, there has never been a study in which these two methods (nitrogen and <b>water</b> <b>adsorptions)</b> were used simultaneously to examine microstructural changes caused by carbonation of cement materials.|$|R

30|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to examine the}} influence of carbonation on the microstructure of cement materials. Different materials, which were CEM I mortar and paste, CEM II mortar and paste, were carbonated at 20  °C, 65  % relative humidity and 20  % of CO 2 concentration. The specific surface area and pore size distribution were determined from two methods: nitrogen <b>adsorption</b> and <b>water</b> <b>adsorption.</b> The results showed that: (1) nitrogen <b>adsorption</b> and <b>water</b> <b>adsorption</b> do not cover the same porous domains and thus, we observed conflicts in the results obtained by these two techniques; (2) the CEM II based materials seemed to be more sensible to a creation of mesoporosity after carbonation than the CEM I based materials. The results of this study also helped to explain why observations in the literature diverge greatly on the influence of carbonation on specific surface area.|$|R

Generally, the basal spacing of the 2 : 1 clay minerals influences greatly on plasticity of the clayey soil. The larger the basal spacing of clay mineral species the higher its <b>water</b> <b>adsorption</b> capacity [7, 15, 37].

Bentonite is introduced as a cheap adsorbent with high potential for use in heat pumps or chillers driven by renewable energy. A simple acid activation procedure increases the inner surface of the material and also enhances the <b>water</b> <b>adsorption</b> capacity markedly. The raw bentonite is activated with different concentrations (0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6 mol L− 1) of HCl.

Experimental and theoretical studies for the adsorption isotherms and kinetics at different <b>adsorption</b> temperatures of <b>water</b> vapor onto 0. 6 HCl treated bentonite have been conducted.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{activated}} carbon surface {{area on the}} amount of fluid adsorbed is significant. Thus, the surface area of an adsorbent is an important factor. The use of the costly BET measurement method is the standard. However, <b>water</b> <b>adsorption</b> method was proposed as an alternate method.

The {{results were}} analysed {{by means of}} the alpha (s) method and the BET, Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR), and D'Arcy-Watt approaches. The shape analysis of the C 6 H 6 isotherms indicates that the porous structure of Cr-PMs and Ti-PMs contains a significant amount of ultramicropores accessible to the adsorbate. The total sorption capacity for C 6 H 5 and the BET surface area increase continuously with decreasing pillar density. The a, method realistically describes the micropore volume of the pillared interlayered clays (PILCs) derived from benzene <b>adsorption.</b> The <b>water</b> <b>adsorption</b> on Cr-PM with maximum pillar density results in an unusually shaped isotherm. The lowering of the surface polarity and/or the content of ultramicropores with decreasing pillar density results in a decrease of the H 2 O sorption capacity and of the BET surface area of the PILCs. The shape analysis of the alpha (s) -plots for water provides qualitative information about the surface homogeneity of the PILCs.
