5|$|In 2001, a team {{continued}} {{the study of}} the gas phase chemistry of seaborgium by reacting the element with O2 in a H2O environment. In <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> to the formation of the oxychloride, the results of the experiment indicated the formation of seaborgium oxide hydroxide, a reaction well known among the lighter group 6 homologues as well as the pseudohomologue uranium.|$|E

American author David Arora suggests that the fruit bodies {{may be used in}} <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> to the candy cap mushrooms, despite being not as fragrant. Chefs in the San Francisco Bay Area have been known to use it for desserts such as ice creams, cakes and caramels.|$|E
5|$|When under attack, some {{octopuses}} {{can perform}} arm autotomy, in <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> {{to the way}} skinks and other lizards detach their tails. The crawling arm may distract would-be predators. Such severed arms remain sensitive to stimuli and move away from unpleasant sensations. Octopuses can replace lost limbs.|$|E

5|$|Although gallium has {{no natural}} {{function}} in biology, gallium ions interact with {{processes in the}} body in <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> to iron(III). Because these processes include inflammation, a marker for many disease states, several gallium salts are used (or are in development) as pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals in medicine. When gallium ions are mistakenly taken up in place of iron(III) by bacteria such as Pseudomonas, the ions interfere with respiration, and the bacteria die. This happens because iron is redox-active, allowing the transfer of electrons during respiration, while gallium is redox-inactive.|$|E
5|$|Although the duo {{felt that}} the presets and {{parameters}} of digital tools would inhibit creativity and innovation, they admitted that Random Access Memories {{could not have been}} made in the complete absence of computer technology. The sessions were recorded simultaneously onto Ampex reels and as Pro Tools tracks; Daft Punk and Guzauski would then listen to each recording in both analogue and digital iterations, deciding which of the two they preferred. Subsequently, the elements were edited by the duo with Pro Tools in <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> to how they would work with samples.|$|E
5|$|Anecdotally {{injection}} of alprazolam has been reported, causing dangerous damage to blood vessels, closure {{of blood vessels}} (embolization) and decay of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis). Alprazolam is not very soluble in water—when crushed in water it does not fully dissolve (40µg/ml of H2O at pH 7). There have also been anecdotal reports of alprazolam being snorted. Due to the low weight of a dose, alprazolam, in one case, was distributed on blotter paper in <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> to LSD.|$|E

5|$|At {{one point}} in the poem, Eliot used terza rima rhyme in <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> to Dante. In a 1950 lecture, he {{discussed}} how he imitated Dante within Little Gidding and the challenges that this presented. The lecture also dwelt on keeping to a set form and how Dante's poetry is the model for religious poetry and poetry in general. Besides Dante, many of the images used in Little Gidding were allusions to Eliot's earlier poems, especially the other poems of the Four Quartets.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the frames}} and {{pictorial}} {{areas of the}} diptych are heavily inscribed with lettering and phrases in Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Van Eyck's early works display a predilection for inscriptions, which serve a dual purpose. They are decorative while also functioning in <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> to the commentaries often seen {{on the margins of}} medieval manuscripts which set in context the significance of the accompanying imagery. Diptychs were usually commissioned for private devotion, and van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison.|$|E
5|$|Enron {{capitalized}} the Raptors, and, in <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> to {{the accounting}} employed {{when a company}} issues stock at a public offering, then booked the notes payable issued as assets on its balance sheet while increasing the shareholders' equity for the same amount. This treatment later became an issue for Enron and its auditor Arthur Andersen as removing it from the balance sheet resulted in a $1.2 billion decrease in net shareholders' equity.|$|E

5|$|Fossil {{footprints}} {{show that}} pterosaurs stood {{with the entire}} foot {{in contact with the}} ground (plantigrade), in <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> to many mammals like humans and bears. Footprints from azhdarchids and several unidentified species show that pterosaurs walked with an erect posture with their four limbs held almost vertically beneath the body, an energy-efficient stance used by most modern birds and mammals, rather than the sprawled limbs of modern reptiles. Indeed, erect-limbs may be omnipresent in pterosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Seeking {{to explore}} more {{alternative}} realities, Stewie takes Brian to a universe resembling the 1960 animated sitcom The Flintstones. Peter {{and his wife}} Lois are shown dressed in <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> to Fred Flintstone and Wilma Flintstone respectively. Becoming tired of this universe, the two then transport themselves to a universe where the atomic bombing of Japan never occurred, allowing Japan to conquer the United States in World War II.|$|E
5|$|Sega later {{produced}} gun games which resemble first-person light gun video games, {{but were}} in fact electro-mechanical games that used rear image projection in <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>similar</b> to a zoetrope to produce moving animations on a screen. An early example of this was Duck Hunt, which Sega released in 1969; it featured animated moving targets on a screen, printed out the player's score on a ticket, and had sound effects that were volume controllable.|$|E
