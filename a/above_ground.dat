5|$|Shale oil {{extraction}} is usually performed <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> (ex situ processing) by mining the oil shale and then treating it in processing facilities. Other modern technologies perform the processing underground (on-site or in situ processing) by applying heat and extracting the oil via oil wells.|$|E

The types <b>above</b> the <b>ground</b> level of PSL have also been expressed in PSL, showing that the type-level and the ground level are relatively independent. The type-levels for the Cyc process ontology <b>above</b> this <b>ground</b> level use the following concepts: ...|$|R

5|$|Both of the {{targeted}} airfields contained sector operations rooms {{from which the}} British fighters were directed into action.

If these buildings were to be hit, it would be a serious blow to the control system in the region.|$|E
5|$|Great Britain has 19 {{operating}} reactors, producing about 20% of its electricity.

5|$|The {{building}} {{broke the}} record for the world's highest residence <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> level, held since 1969 by the nearby John Hancock Center.

5|$|The castle was {{embedded}} within an ornamental landscape, with two gardens laid {{out at the}} same time as the castle was founded and a third created later. Wressle was intended as a high-status residence rather than a fortress and was never besieged. However, it was held by Parliament during the English Civil War and demolished in 1646–50. Nearly 150 years later, it was further damaged by fire and all that remains <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> of the building is the south range.|$|E
