The unit is well suited for lens undistortion and for stereo head rectification in embedded real-time systems. The proposed architecture has been realized on a prototyping system based on an Altera STRATIX EP 1 S 60 FPGA resulting in a performance of 35 frames per second for a 1024 × 1024 pixels input image. 2. INDRODUCTION Modern applications such as robot assembling automation, upcoming mobile robot platforms for homes, and car safety features require both, 3 D perception and object classification, for navigation and object manipulation [9]. Real-time performance of approximately 30 frames per second is mandatory and a very critical design issue. Em-bedded stereo vision sensors, consisting of a sensor head and <b>a</b> <b>calculation</b> <b>unit,</b> are very well suited for stereoscopic perception but require huge computational effort. Due to mounting tolerances within the sensor head, resulting in a maximum relative shift and revolution of these two camera images, rectification is absolutely necessary to reduce the matching effort. In our employed method it is done by applying a remap with offline calculated coefficients. The camera lenses also {{have an impact on the}} source image, resulting in a distortion in border areas which is reversed by a second remap.

40|$|The {{total amount}} of {{photovoltaic}} (PV) energy production in the global energy mix has been increasing strongly {{all over the world}} in the last decade. This phenomenon has been mainly driven by the promotion of renewable energies, {{as well as by the}} well known feed-in tariffs. Although the major part of PV installations consists in roof mounted panels in private, collective or commercial buildings, the amount of large scale PV power plants, from 200 kW to 10 MW or more is increasing drastically. Such large scale PV power plants already represent nearly 20 % of the total installed PV capacity. Indeed, by reducing of the overall system costs, they are becoming serious alternatives to fossil fuel or nuclear power plants for utilities. [GRAPHICS] Taking into account that a sun tracking system can substantially improve the daily energy production of flat plate modules (approx. 10 % to 50 %), and that such a tracking unit is absolutely necessary for concentrating photovoltaic systems (CPV), one understands its crucial role for solar power plants. One or two axis solar trackers already represent 27 % of the total power plant capacity worldwide in 2008. This part is increasing constantly since the additional investment costs for the mechanics are relatively inexpensive compared to PV. Especially for CPV systems, the control unit of a solar tracker has to provide reliable and precise positioning; hence controlling one or two drives to move the panels in a restricted angle window to the sun (typ. 1 degrees to 0. 1 degrees). In principle, such a positioning unit consists of <b>a</b> <b>calculation</b> <b>unit</b> (e. g. : mu C or DSP), a power unit driving the motors and a feed-back circuit for different kinds of sensors (e. g. : position or irradiance sensors).

Despite this fact, quite {{an amount of}} energy is wasted in today's UEs’ analogue (AFEs) and digital frontends (DFEs).

These requirements define a worst-case scenario still ensuring reliable communication. In a typical receiving process the actual requirements can be considered as less critical. Knowledge about the actual environmental spectral conditions allows to reconfigure both frontends to the actual needs and to save energy.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a fully pipelined and parameterised parallel hardware {{implementation of a}} large vocabulary, user-independent and continuous speech recognition system for use in mobile applications. Algorithm acceleration is achieved by realising in hardware the most time-consuming components of the speech recognition system. By adopting a parallel solution, the necessary calculations can be completed in a sufficiently short elapsed time for embedded target systems. Sphinx 3 is identified as an appropriate speech recognition system for this work and is profiled to determine the most time-consuming parts of the code. As these parts of the code employ calculations based on floating point operations, which are not suitable for the high-performance and low-power execution on embedded systems, these calculations have been converted to scaled integer operations. It is verified using the AN 4, RM 1 and TIMIT speech databases that the scaled integer version of the speech recognition system can achieve a similar word error rate to the original floating point version, while taking less than 8 % of the calculation time used by the original version. The scaled integer version of the speech recognition system is redesigned in VHDL for parallel implementation in electronic hardware. The designs of <b>a</b> <b>calculation</b> module and <b>a</b> data module are described, both {{of which can be}} configured according to the number of parallel units and the data module can be configured according to the total numbers of feature vectors and senones used in the speech representation.
