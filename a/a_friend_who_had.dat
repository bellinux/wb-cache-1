Although he {{continued}} farming, he became interested in a career in the Anglican Church. Encouraged by <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been a chaplain in the military, he began training for the priesthood in February 1946. He became a priest in 1948 and took up a curate in Palmerston North, before becoming chaplain at the nearby Linton Military Camp.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} first chat with Manning, Lamo {{discussed}} the information with Chet Uber of the volunteer group ProjectVIGILANT, which researches cybercrime, and with Timothy Webster, <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> worked in Army counterintelligence. Both advised Lamo {{to go to the}} authorities. His friend informed the Army's Criminal Investigation Command (CID), and Lamo was contacted by CID agents shortly thereafter. He told them he believed Manning was endangering lives. He was largely ostracized by the hacker community afterwards. Nicks argues, on the other hand, that it was thanks to Lamo that the government had months to ameliorate any harm caused by the release of the diplomatic cables.|$|E
5|$|Blamey became {{involved}} in his first and greatest scandal soon after taking office. During a raid on a brothel in Fitzroy on 21 October 1925, the police encountered a man who produced Blamey's police badge, No. 80. Blamey later {{said that he had}} given his key ring, which included his badge, to <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> served with him in France, so that the man could help himself to some alcohol in Blamey's locker at the Naval and Military Club. His story was corroborated by his friend Stanley Savige, who was with him at the time. Blamey protected the man in question, who he said was married with children, and refused to identify him. The man has never been identified, but the description given by the detectives and the brothel owner did not match Blamey.|$|E

25|$|Magda soon grew {{frustrated}} in {{her marriage}} because Quandt spent little time with her. His main interest {{seemed to be}} the expansion of his business empire.

25|$|But an air {{of mystery}} {{surrounds}} Marino's life, especially the various times he spent in prison; one of the arrests was due to procuring an abortion for a certain Antonella Testa, daughter of the mayor of Naples, but whether she was pregnant by Marino {{or one of his}} friends is unknown; the second conviction (for which he risked a capital sentence) was due to the poet's forging episcopal bulls in order to save <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been involved in a duel.|$|E

25|$|Act III finds Gloucester {{arranging}} {{a marriage}} for Arthur with a French princess that would guarantee wealth, allies, {{and help him}} achieve his goal of a unified, peaceful, and prosperous Britain. Ignoring this arrange wedding, Arthur marries Guenhera, the sister of <b>a</b> <b>friend,</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> loved him since childhood. She miscarries twice, and Arthur's nobles complain {{that he no longer}} has the mettle for military matters, and has turned the court into a place of effeminate recreation and artistic endeavors (one of these nobles considers assassinating Arthur to stop this).|$|E
25|$|Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two {{were the}} next musicians {{to be added}} to the {{performances}} by Sun musicians.

25|$|Dawn, who {{had become}} a member of the Nevada Assembly in 1998, denied the {{allegations}} in 2006, claiming that Sandoval had merely been <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> helped out around the house and was given clothing and household goods, but was not an employee. An employment contract between Dawn Gibbons and Sandoval, however, appeared to disprove that assertion, as it clearly laid out the terms and conditions of Sandoval's hiring. Documents filed during Sandoval's 1988 application for working papers also contradicted earlier statements by Dawn Gibbons that the family had not known that the woman was in the United States illegally.|$|E
25|$|While still {{attending}} {{high school}} in Dartmouth, he enlisted in the Massachusetts National Guard in 1938 and joined his uncle's old regiment, the 101st Field Artillery. In 1940, he joined the United States Army Air Corps and entered gunnery school. When {{it appeared that the}} U.S. would not enter World War II, Millett, eager to fight, deserted in mid-1941. With <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> received a bad conduct discharge from the U.S. Marine Corps, Millett hitchhiked to Canada and enlisted in the Canadian Army. Assigned to the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery, he was sent to the United Kingdom, where he served as an anti-aircraft radar operator in London during the Blitz. By the time he arrived in the United Kingdom, the U.S. had entered the war; Millett transferred to the U.S. Army in 1942.|$|E
25|$|Nathan-Turner {{had thought}} that he too would finally be leaving the series, but with no other {{producer}} available or {{willing to take on}} the series, he was instructed to remain. As a BBC staff producer, he {{had little choice but to}} either accept this or resign from the Corporation's staff. Not having expected to be producing season twenty-four, Nathan-Turner was left with little time to prepare, hiring inexperienced Andrew Cartmel as script editor on the advice of <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> run a BBC Drama Script Unit course that Cartmel had attended, and casting little-known Scottish actor Sylvester McCoy as the Seventh Doctor. In his first season, McCoy, a comedy actor, portrayed the character with a degree of clown-like humour, but Cartmel's influence soon changed that. The Seventh Doctor developed into a darker figure than any of his earlier incarnations, manipulating people like chess pieces and always seeming to be playing a deeper game than he ever let on.|$|E
