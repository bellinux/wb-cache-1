5|$|Harrison ran in all {{the free}} states except Massachusetts, and the slave states of Delaware, Maryland, and Kentucky. Hugh L. White ran in the {{remaining}} slave states except for South Carolina. Daniel Webster ran in Massachusetts, and Willie P. Mangum in South Carolina. The plan narrowly failed, as Van Buren won the election with 170 electoral votes. <b>A</b> <b>swing</b> of just over 4,000 votes in Pennsylvania would have given that state's 30 electoral votes to Harrison, and the election would have been decided in the House of Representatives.|$|E
5|$|North of Welland, Highway58 {{initially}} travelled concurrent with Highway3A along Niagara Street and the Merrittville Highway to Highway20, where Highway3A ended. Highway58 turned {{east and}} travelled concurrent with Highway20 across the Welland Canal at Allanburg, before turning north onto the current route. However, it continued north along Allanburg Road into Thorold, where it crossed the Welland Canal on <b>a</b> <b>swing</b> bridge and travelled north into St. Catharines along Ormond Street, Merritt Street and Hartzel Road (Niagara Regional Road52) to Highway8 (Queenston Street, now Niagara Regional Road81).|$|E

5|$|The 50 or so {{crossings}} of the Willamette River include many historic structures, {{such as the}} Van Buren Street Bridge, <b>a</b> <b>swing</b> bridge. Built in 1913, it carries Oregon Route 34 (Corvallis–Lebanon Highway) over the river upstream of RM131 (RK211) in Corvallis. The machinery to operate the swing span was removed in the 1950s. The Oregon City Bridge, built in 1922, replaced a suspension span constructed at the site in 1888. It carries Oregon Route 43 over the river at about RM26 (RK42) between Oregon City and West Linn.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} railroad {{bridge was}} replaced by <b>a</b> <b>swing</b> bridge in 1879 that, along with the Glasgow Railroad Bridge across the Missouri River, {{was one of the}} United States' first all steel railroad bridges. This bridge was constructed from Bessemer steel, which proved too brittle and so the bridge was replaced again in 1898. The replacement bridge was constructed on land and floated into position, allowing the old structure to be removed and the new one put in place in 27½ hours on March 13 and March 14, 1898.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} locks and bridges in Hungerford, {{including}} one which carries the A338. Hungerford Marsh Lock is unique on the Kennet and Avon Canal {{in that it}} has <b>a</b> <b>swing</b> bridge directly over {{the centre of the}} lock that must be opened before the lock may be used. In the area around the lock, called Hungerford Marsh Nature Reserve, more than 120 bird species have been recorded.|$|E

5|$|A heated altercation between Ramirez and {{teammate}} Kevin Youkilis {{took place}} on June 5, during a game at Fenway Park against the Tampa Bay Rays. The Boston Globe speculated that Youkilis was angry that Ramirez {{has been slow to}} join a bench-clearing brawl earlier in the game. The altercation may have also been caused by Ramirez objecting to what he believed was excessive complaining by Youkilis about the strike zone, as well as the first baseman's penchant for sometimes throwing his helmet in frustration after making an out. Before the fifth inning, Ramirez was caught on NESN cameras taking <b>a</b> <b>swing</b> at Youkilis. Ramirez and Youkilis yelled at each other and had to be separated by teammates, coaches, and training staff. Youkilis headed out to the field still yelling at Ramirez, while Ramirez was escorted into the tunnel leading to the clubhouse by bench coach Brad Mills and trainer Paul Lessard.|$|E
5|$|Another {{music video}} for the Maanstudio remix {{version of the}} song was shot by Ciprian Strugariu and {{uploaded}} onto MediaPro Music's YouTube channel on 9 December 2011. Andra Moga and Violeta Irimia were credited for styling and make-up, respectively. The visual starts with angle shots of the singer lying on sand, followed by her walking on a field wearing a black dress. Subsequently, the singer poses {{in front of a}} stonewall and performs to the song sporting a transparent jacket and a black leotard. The last scenes show her on <b>a</b> <b>swing,</b> swimming while a sea storm takes place, and her posing in front of a body of water with a black bodysuit on.|$|E
5|$|At the 3 March 1962 election, Askin led the Coalition {{to another}} defeat to the Labor Party, now under Bob Heffron, {{who had become}} Premier {{following}} Cahill's death in October 1959. Morton retained his seat again with 80.76%. Heffron was Premier until his retirement on 30 April 1964. He was succeeded by Jack Renshaw, whose tenure was {{perceived to be the}} last days of a party which, after almost {{a quarter of a century}} in government, was tired. At the May 1965 election, Askin led the Coalition to its first ever state electoral victory, gaining eight seats and <b>a</b> <b>swing</b> of 5.6% to achieve a majority of two. Askin became the first Liberal Premier. Morton was re-elected with 82.30%.|$|E

5|$|Below Spalding, {{there were}} no {{restrictions}} on headroom, which allowed small coasters to reach the town. The bridge at Fosdyke was <b>a</b> <b>swing</b> bridge, {{to comply with the}} provisions of the Fosdyke Bridge Act of 1870. The demise of such traffic allowed it {{to be replaced by a}} fixed bridge with headroom of , but the powers of the original act had to be rescinded, and the Port of Fosdyke Act was obtained in 1987 to allow this to happen. The redundant wharfs at Fosdyke have been developed to provide moorings for yachts and other pleasure craft. The lock at Fulney has three sets of gates, two pointing towards the sea, and a third between them which points upriver. The lock can thus only be used when the level below it is higher than the level above it, and as the tide falls, the intermediate gate closes to prevent its use.|$|E
5|$|Cahill had won {{popular support}} as a {{vigorous}} and impressive minister who had resolved problems with New South Wales' electricity supply {{and in his}} first 10 months as premier had reinvigorated the party. He brought order to the government's chaotic public works program. In addition, he attacked the increasingly unpopular federal Coalition government of Robert Menzies. All this, combined with Bruxner and Treatt constantly clashing over policy and candidate issues, contributed to the Liberal-Country Coalition again being defeated at the 14 February 1953 election. This amounted to a total loss of ten seats, three being Country Party seats, and <b>a</b> <b>swing</b> against them of 7.2%. Bruxner retained his seat with 60.15%.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{proceeded}} slowly, to {{the extent}} that there were letters in the local newspaper complaining about the delays. The first train ran into Epworth on 25 November 1901, to test the new bridge, and the event was attended by a crowd of over 400. The line involved more earthworks than the Goole and Marshland Light Railway, with major cuttings at Haxey and Epworth, where steam excavators were used, and <b>a</b> <b>swing</b> bridge over the canal at Crowle. The first fatality was a 15-year-old boy who was hit by a rock during blasting, and died at Doncaster Hospital in early 1902.|$|E

5|$|Continuing {{down the}} line, the train passes the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad mine train roller coaster {{attraction}} and traverses <b>a</b> <b>swing</b> bridge, which crosses a canal {{that connects the}} Rivers of America to a boat servicing area. This bridge was originally located in Wabasso, Florida, and was previously owned by the Florida East Coast Railway. The train then runs through an area where numerous static and Audio-Animatronic displays of Native Americans and wild animals can be seen. After that, the train goes under an overpass, passes the spur line leading to the WDWRR's roundhouse where its trains are stored and maintained, and arrives at its next stop at Fantasyland Station.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} verse, {{it has the}} {{spacecraft}} traveling past the moon, whilst Utada cleans up the mess the passengers left on their tables. By the second pre-chorus, several passengers play ping pong, as Utada exercises. The second chorus has Utada dancing inside a party, whilst intercut scenes of different stop motion animations are seen. In the bridge section, it has a close-up of Utada {{in front of a}} forest-like backdrop again, and also has Utada sitting on <b>a</b> <b>swing.</b> The final chorus has the spacecraft falling onto the ground, and creates a vast field of flowers, trees, and grass. The final scene has the camera zooming out of the spacecraft next to a tree, riddled with vines and flowers. The music video and the behind the scenes video was included on her DVD compilation Single Clip Collection Vol. 3 (2000).|$|E
5|$|If the {{steering}} of a bike is locked, it becomes {{virtually impossible to}} balance while riding. On the other hand, if the gyroscopic effect of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding counter-rotating wheels, it is still easy to balance while riding. One other way that a bike can be balanced, with or without locked steering, is by applying appropriate torques between the bike and rider {{similar to the way}} a gymnast can swing up from hanging straight down on uneven parallel bars, a person can start swinging on <b>a</b> <b>swing</b> from rest by pumping their legs, or a double inverted pendulum can be controlled with an actuator only at the elbow.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the bridge's construction, Pleasure Island was {{accessible}} only by ferry. In 1907, the Pleasure Beach Ferry Company was given the rights to build a movable toll bridge. A series of trestles were built across the tidal flats with <b>a</b> <b>swing</b> span across the dredged channel. The swing span was constructed in 1927, but in the Great Depression the Beach Ferry Company transferred control of the bridge {{to the city of}} Bridgeport. The tolls were removed and the bridge continued to be used after Pleasure Beach's closing in 1968, until the 1996 fire. Repairs were made to the bridge in 1988 with money from the state. In 1994, the need to replace the bridge resulted in a state and federal promise of $20 million, but this was rejected by the Connecticut Department of Transportation in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The A82 runs {{towards the}} centre of Loch Oich, passes Invergarry Castle, and crosses the River Garry. Just after the bridge, the A87 heads west towards Skye, while the A82 {{continues}} along the western shore of the loch up to the Bridge of Oich at its northern end. This bridge was constructed in 1932, bypassing the 1850s Bridge of Oich, a Taper Suspension Bridge built by James Dredge. The A82 continues along the general line of Wade's Military Road up to Fort Augustus, crossing the canal at <b>a</b> <b>swing</b> bridge next to the locks in the village.|$|E
5|$|The Buddhist {{version of}} the Bhasmasura tale {{continues}} with Shiva (Ishvara) asking the female-Vishnu, who is seated on <b>a</b> <b>swing,</b> to marry him. She asks Shiva to get the permission of his wife Umayangana to take her home. Shiva returns with Umayangana's consent to find the female-Vishnu pregnant, who sends him back to get permission to bring a pregnant woman home. When he returns, a child is born and female-Vishnu is pregnant again. She requests Shiva to seek approval to bring a pregnant woman with a child home. This happens six more times. Finally, Shiva brings Umayangana with him to witness the miraculous woman. Vishnu then returns to his male form. Umayangana embraces the six youngest children merging them into the six-headed Skanda, while the eldest, named Aiyanayaka ("eldest brother") remains intact. Aiyanayaka is identified with Aiyanar.|$|E
