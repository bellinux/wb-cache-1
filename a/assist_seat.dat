40|$|Biodynamic models {{representing}} distributed human-seat interactions can <b>assist</b> <b>seat</b> design. This study {{sought to}} develop a finite element (FE) model representing the soft tissues of the body supported by seating and the vertical in-line apparent mass and the fore-and-aft cross-axis apparent mass of the seated human body during vertical vibration excitation. The model was developed with rigid parts representing the torso segments, skeletal structures (pelvis and femurs) and deformable parts representing the soft tissues of the buttocks and the thighs. The model had three vibration modes at frequencies less than 15 Hz and provided reasonable vertical in-line apparent mass and fore-and-aft cross-axis apparent mass. The model can be developed to represent dynamic interactions between the body and a seat over a seat surface (e. g. dynamic pressure distributions and variations in seat transmissibility over the seat surface). Practitioner Summary: The three-dimensional FE model {{of the human body}} represents the in-line apparent mass and cross-axis apparent mass measured on a seat. With deformable soft tissues it can <b>assist</b> <b>seat</b> design by representing dynamic human-seat interactions, such as pressure distributions and variations in seat transmissibility over a seat surface...|$|E

40|$|This work's general {{topic is}} {{advanced}} driver assistance systems. In particular, it's about the <b>assisted</b> driver <b>seat</b> adjustment in dependence on anthropometric data, {{the detection of}} Out-of-Position postures and the driver drowsiness detection. Already existing systems use sensors like in- and off-cabin cameras to detect drowsiness or require the manual input of anthropometric data to adjust the driver's seat. Contrary to these system's approaches, {{the aim of this}} work is to build a system which captures drowsiness symptoms, tracks the head position and captures anthropometric data only by the use of invisible seat integrated capacitive proximity sensors. Still, the aim includes the evaluation of the system's concepts to give direction for further examinations. The idea is the integration of several capacitive proximity sensors at meaningful positions into a driver's seat. Owing {{to the fact that the}}se sensors can sense through non-conductive materials, the sensors can be installed invisible under the seat cover. Furthermore, the sensors measure changes in the electric field. Occupants, which are in range of the sensors, change the electric field. Therefore, the sensor values shall give information about the occupant's anthropometry and position. With these anthropometric data, an <b>assisted</b> <b>seat</b> adjustment shall be possible. Especially the movement of the driver's head could give information about the driver's drowsiness. A first question of this report addresses the driver's anthropometry. What's a proper seat adjustment? Furthermore, what are the symptoms for drowsiness and which could be measured with capacitive proximity sensors? Moreover, what is an Out-of-Position posture? With information about the anthropometrical requirements, the work shows which concepts can meet the demands on the system. Owing to the fact that the system needs evaluation, how shall a prototype be developed with reference to the concepts? Due to the results of the evaluation, the concepts can satisfy the demands on the system. The ideas which rely on machine learning classifiers result in reliable data. Nevertheless, the different approaches show different demands on the collected data's diversity, which is used to train the algorithms. Besides the machine learning classifiers, many functions of the <b>assisted</b> <b>seat</b> adjustment depend on generic relations between the prototype's sensor system and the occupant's anthropometry. These functions show positive results. Nevertheless, a multiclass SVM approach with discrete adjustment classification could lead to better results, because this approach can include more sensors. Therefore, further obedience between the sensors' data and the anthropometry could be included. Several functions of advanced driver assistance systems are integrated into the capacitive proximity sensing supported advanced driver assistance system. The evaluation shows that invisibly seat integrated capacitive proximity sensors can sense several symptoms of driver drowsiness. Furthermore, the system can <b>assist</b> the driver's <b>seat</b> adjustment and detect "Out-of-Position" postures. The detection concepts are constrained by several requirements for a proper working system. Consequently, the next step is a further integration of the system into a real car. Supplementary, the evaluation shows that the machine learning concepts require a plenty of miscellaneous data. Hence, a further data collection will improve the systems creditableness. Besides the further data collection and real system integration, the developed prototype can be the basis for a further function development, like the gesture recognition for the control of a multimedia system...|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{challenge in}} robotics is {{to reason with}} incomplete domain knowledge to explain unexpected observations and partial descriptions extracted from sensor observations. Existing explanation generation systems draw on ideas that can be mapped to a multidimensional space of system characteristics, defined by distinctions, such as how they represent knowledge and if and how they reason with heuristic guidance. Instances in this multidimensional space corresponding to existing systems do not support all of the desired explanation generation capabilities for robots. We seek to address this limitation by thoroughly understanding the range of explanation generation capabilities and the interplay between the distinctions that characterize them. Towards this objective, this paper first specifies three fundamental distinctions {{that can be used}} to characterize many existing explanation generation systems. We explore and understand the effects of these distinctions by comparing the capabilities of two systems that differ substantially along these axes, using execution scenarios involving a robot waiter <b>assisting</b> in <b>seating</b> people and delivering orders in a restaurant. The second part of the paper uses this study to argue that the desired explanation generation capabilities corresponding to these three distinctions can mostly be achieved by exploiting the complementary strengths of the two systems that were explored. This is followed by a discussion of the capabilities related to other major distinctions to provide detailed recommendations for developing an explanation generation system for robots...|$|R

40|$|The {{eco-efficiency}} {{assessment of}} a water use system at the meso level, {{as well as the}} estimation of the anticipated eco-efficiency improvements as a result of innovative practices/technologies, is a conceptually and methodologically challenging issue. A systemic approach is required to capture the complexity of all interrelated aspects and the interactions among the heterogeneous actors involved in the system. This involves mapping the behaviour of the system into representative models, structuring the analysis in easy to understand procedures and developing versatile software tools for supporting the analysis. This paper presents a web-integrated suite of tools and resources (EcoWater Toolbox) for assessing eco-efficiency improvements from innovative technologies in water use systems. Equipped with a continuously updated inventory of currently available technological innovations as well as a repository of eco-efficiency indicators and their evaluation rules, the EcoWater Toolbox supports a comprehensive four-step eco-efficiency {{assessment of a}} water use system: (1) allows the users to frame the case study by defining system boundaries, describing the water supply chain and value chains and including all the actors; (2) helps the users to establish a baseline eco-efficiency assessment, using the integrated modelling tools; (3) supports the users in identifying both sector-specific and system-wide technologies and practices to suit their situation, through the integrated technology inventory; and (4) enables the users to assess innovative technology solutions by developing predictive technology scenarios and comparing these with baseline results. At the core of the Toolbox are two modelling tools, which combine both economic and environmental viewpoints into a single modelling framework. The “Systemic Environmental Analysis Tool” (<b>SEAT)</b> <b>assists</b> in building a representation of the physical system, its processes and interactions and forms the basis for evaluating the environmental performance of the system. The “Economic Value chain Analysis Tool” (EVAT) addresses the value chain and focuses on the economic component of the eco-efficiency. Both tools provide a graphical model construction interface that is implemented in client-side and incorporate advanced features such as model scripting. The methodology adopted and the operational aspects of the EcoWater Toolbox are presented and demonstrated through the assessment of the eco-efficiency performance associated with the water value chain {{in the case of a}} milk production unit of a dairy industry...|$|R
60|$|The last {{farewell}} was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far {{and near}} the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared {{to us from the}} cradle by Speranza's plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang The Night before Larry was stretched in their usual mirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day's entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat. The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite. The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed doyen of the party who had to be <b>assisted</b> to his <b>seat</b> by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y.

All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness. An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland's patron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged. The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties. The readywitted ninefooter's suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.O.T.E.I., several of whom were bleeding profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies' and gentlemen's gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.|$|R
