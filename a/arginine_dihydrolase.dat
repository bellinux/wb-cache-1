5000|$|Diagnosing infections with C. canimorsus can be difficult. Common {{practice}} for culturing isolates {{is to keep}} agar plates for one week; sometimes cultures of C. canimorsus are not visible at that point due to slow growth or inappropriate media. C. canimorsus requires very specific culture media and conditions; enriched media is necessary. C. canimorsus displays enhanced growth in high concentrations of carbon dioxide, therefore {{it is necessary to}} culture the bacteria in candle extinction jars or carbon dioxide incubators. [...] To diagnose this bacillus, certain reactions may be tested. The bacteria should test positive for catalase and oxidase, <b>arginine</b> <b>dihydrolase,</b> maltose, and lactose. It should test negative for nitrate reduction, urease, and H2S production. C. canimorsus can be distinguished from other Gram-negative bacteria by testing negative for inulin and sucrose. [...] Due to the relatively slow growth of this bacteria, diagnosis often relies upon the clinician having knowledge that the patient was previously in contact with a canine or feline. Once aware of this, clinicians can request that agar plates be kept longer than one week to ensure proper isolation of the bacteria. Sometimes, even these methods fail. Cases have been noted where cultures repeatedly came up negative for C. canimorsus, only to determine its presence with 16S rRNA gene sequencing. [...] PCR assays of species specific genes may also be beneficial. For individuals presenting with meningitis, C. canimorsus can be diagnosed with a CSF Gram stain. [...] These methods are more costly but are the best way to ensure species-level identification. Isolates are usually obtained from blood cultures (88% of the time) and less frequently from bite wounds. In incidents where the patient is in full septic shock, whole blood smears may be effective.|$|E

This growth stimulation by canavanine was unique, since it previously was found to inhibit the growth of organisms which require arginine.

Canavanine inhibited the rate of arginine degradation by the <b>arginine</b> <b>dihydrolase</b> enzyme system in intact cells.

Bacteriol. 86 : 195 â 206. 1963. âArginine degradation {{is a significant}} metabolic process for pleuropneumonia-like organisms (PPLO; Mycoplasma) isolated from cell culture. The conversion of arginine to ornithine in PPLO-contaminated cell culture was rapid, and occurred by the <b>arginine</b> <b>dihydrolase</b> pathway involving arginine deiminase, ornithine transcarbamylase, and carbamyl phosphokinase. In the absence of PPLO contamination, arginine conversion to ornithine was minimal and took place by an arginase activity present in the cell culture, {{but not in the}} PPLO. All five PPLO strains isolated from cell culture accomplished the conversion of arginine to ornithine, and contained the requisite enzyme of the <b>arginine</b> <b>dihydrolase</b> system, whereas PPLO-free cell cultures did not. Supplementation of PPLO culture broth with arginine increased the extent of PPLO growth. When the arginine content of the culture limited growth, arginine was completely converted to ornithine. When growth was limited in the presence of excess arginine, citrulline was the major breakdown product. It is suggested that the conversion of arginine to ornithing constitutes a significant, and possibly major, source of adenosine triphosphate for this class of organisms...|$|E

40|$|A {{specific}} procedure {{has been}} developed {{for the detection of}} the first two enzymes involved in the <b>arginine</b> <b>dihydrolase</b> system and the detection of the decarboxylases of arginine, glutamic acid, histidine, lysine, ornithine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. A loopful of growth of each organism from dihydrolase-decarboxylase induction agar medium (or broth) was washed and incubated separately with 0. 2 -ml samples of three test media supplemented with different amino acids. Each spent test medium was dansylated, and the dansyl derivatives were separated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography on polyamide sheets. The end products (citrulline, ornithine, gamma-amino-n-butyric acid, and amines) produced during incubation were estimated by comparing the fluorescent intensities of end products from the spent test media and of the corresponding parent amino acids from test medium controls after thin-layer chromatography. The method is reproducible, requiring incubation of an organism in three test media for 1 h for simultaneous detection of the first two enzymes involved in the <b>arginine</b> <b>dihydrolase</b> system and of eight amino acid decarboxylases. This method has been successfully applied to gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms and also to Mycoplasmatales. It could simplify and improve the accuracy of the corresponding biochemical tests performed in clinical laboratories for the identification and differentiation of microorganisms, and it may prove particularly useful for the differentiation of species of Pseudomonas and Mycoplasma...|$|E

Nine type or reference strains of Abiotrophia defectiva, Abiotrophia adiacens, and Abiotrophia elegans and 36 oral Abiotrophia isolates including the ones presumptively identified as Gemella morbillorum by the rapid ID 32 STREP system were divided into four groups: A. defectiva (genotype 1), A. adiacens (genotype 2), A. elegans (genotype 4), and a fourth species (genotype 3) which we propose be named Abiotrophia para-adiacens sp. nov. A PCR assay specific for detection and identification of the novel Abiotrophia species was developed. A. para-adiacens generally produced Î²-glucosidase but did not produce Î±- or Î²-galactosidase or <b>arginine</b> <b>dihydrolase,</b> did not ferment, trehalose, pullulan, or tagatose, and was serotype IV, V, or VI.

40|$|Significant {{advances}} {{in the field of}} proteinase biosynthesis have been made in recent years through the use of adaptive enzyme forming sys-tems. These systems are valuable because their specificity can be used to conveniently assay for the newly formed protein material. The greatest attention has been focused on studying the mechanism of protein formation, but relatively little effort has been directed toward determining the nature of possible regulatory mechanisms that control protein synthesis. An opportunity to investigate a phase of the metabolic control of protein biosynthesis was afforded us {{as a result of an}} observation (Rabin and Zimmerman, 1956) that an inordinately large arginine requirement (in a defined medium) existed for maximal pro-teinase formation by Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens. The experimental design for this paper was predicated on an initial assumption that the <b>arginine</b> <b>dihydrolase</b> system (Hills, 1940) was directly responsible for the magnitude of this amino acid requirement for proteinase formation; furthermore, there could be three possible effects of the dihydrolase system that would result in this large requirement for arginine. First, the dihydrolase system could influence proteinase biosynthesis through limiting the amount of arginine available to the proteinase-synthesizing system by competing for a common substrate. If this competition prevailed inside the cell, the <b>arginine</b> <b>dihydrolase</b> system would act as a governor of general protein synthesis as well as proteinase formation.
