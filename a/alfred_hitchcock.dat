5|$|Minneapolis's Oak Street Cinema, a volunteer-run {{repertory}} cinema, ran films {{seven days}} per week until cutbacks in programming {{had to be made}} for financial reasons. A collective of the Oak Street volunteers formed Take-Up Productions, which was established to promote showing films not typically screened in larger movie houses. The organization began with outdoor screenings, starting with Watermelon Man, which was projected against a white brick wall behind a coffee shop, and then began to rent out theaters throughout the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul area, including the Riverview, Heights, and Parkway. Some screenings, such as that of Lawrence of Arabia and a series of <b>Alfred</b> <b>Hitchcock</b> films, drew hundreds of viewers.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, the Box Office Attractions {{name was}} replaced with the newly incorporated Fox Film Corporation. Edwards remained one of the studio's most important directors and one of William Fox's closest advisers. He became known for his epic filmmaking and for a permissive approach to directing his starring cast, an attitude that led Bara's biographer to compare him to <b>Alfred</b> <b>Hitchcock.</b> Often, that cast included Bara, whose films with him include Under Two Flags (1916), the epic historical drama Cleopatra (1917), and A Woman There Was (1919).|$|E
5|$|According to {{the book}} <b>Alfred</b> <b>Hitchcock</b> and the Making of Psycho, the censors in charge of {{enforcing}} the Production Code wrangled with Hitchcock because some of them insisted they could see one of Leigh's breasts. Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Each of the censors reversed their positions: those who had previously seen the breast now did not, {{and those who had}} not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh's stand-in. The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening with them on the set. Since they did not show up for the re-shoot, the opening stayed.|$|E
