5|$|Justinian also {{strengthened}} {{the borders of}} the Empire from Africa to the East through the construction of fortifications and ensured Constantinople of its water supply through construction of underground cisterns (see Basilica Cistern). To prevent floods from damaging the strategically important border town Dara, an advanced <b>arch</b> <b>dam</b> was built. During his reign the large Sangarius Bridge was built in Bithynia, securing a major military supply route to the east. Furthermore, Justinian restored cities damaged by earthquake or war and built a new city near his place of birth called Justiniana Prima, which was intended to replace Thessalonica as the political and religious centre of Illyricum.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plans for}} {{the facade of the}} dam, the power plant, the outlet tunnels and {{ornaments}} clashed with the modern look of an <b>arch</b> <b>dam.</b> The Bureau of Reclamation, more concerned with the dam's functionality, adorned it with a Gothic-inspired balustrade and eagle statues. This initial design was criticized by many as being too plain and unremarkable for a project of such immense scale, so Los Angeles-based architect Gordon B. Kaufmann, then the supervising architect to the Bureau of Reclamation, was brought in to redesign the exteriors. Kaufmann greatly streamlined the design, and applied an elegant Art Deco style to the entire project. He designed sculptured turrets rising seamlessly from the dam face and clock faces on the intake towers set for the time in Nevada and Arizona— both states are in different time zones, but since Arizona does not observe Daylight Saving Time, the clocks display the same time for more than half the year.|$|E

The temperature loading conditions cause a high expanse of stresses at the various interface locations due to change in environmental conditions.

25|$|Hunts Creek {{near the}} city of Parramatta, Australia, was dammed in the 1850s, to cater for the demand for water from the growing {{population}} of the city. The masonry <b>arch</b> <b>dam</b> wall was designed by Lieutenant Percy Simpson who was influenced by the advances in dam engineering techniques made by the Royal Engineers in India. The dam cost £17,000 and was completed in 1856 as the first engineered dam built in Australia, and the second <b>arch</b> <b>dam</b> in the world built to mathematical specifications.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>arch</b> <b>dam,</b> {{stability}} is obtained {{by a combination}} of arch and gravity action. If the upstream face is vertical the entire weight of the dam must be carried to the foundation by gravity, while the distribution of the normal hydrostatic pressure between vertical cantilever and arch action will depend upon the stiffness of the dam in a vertical and horizontal direction. When the upstream face is sloped the distribution is more complicated. The normal component of the weight of the arch ring may be taken by the arch action, while the normal hydrostatic pressure will be distributed as described above. For this type of dam, firm reliable supports at the abutments (either buttress or canyon side wall) are more important. The most desirable place for an <b>arch</b> <b>dam</b> is a narrow canyon with steep side walls composed of sound rock. The safety of an <b>arch</b> <b>dam</b> is dependent on the strength of the side wall abutments, hence not only should the arch be well seated on the side walls but also the character of the rock should be carefully inspected.|$|E

25|$|When {{situated}} on a suitable site, a gravity dam can {{prove to be}} a better alternative to other types of dams. When built on a carefully studied foundation, the gravity dam probably represents the best developed example of dam building. Since the fear of flood is a strong motivator in many regions, gravity dams are being built in some instances where an <b>arch</b> <b>dam</b> would have been more economical.|$|E
25|$|The {{first such}} dam was opened {{two years earlier}} in France.

25|$|A {{gravity dam}} can be {{combined}} with an <b>arch</b> <b>dam</b> into an arch-gravity dam for areas with massive amounts of water flow but less material available for a purely gravity dam.

25|$|In great {{contrast}} to the bright pristine nature of the stations, the dams are organic and entwined with the natural rock. They are generally arch dams, curved in plan, bearing onto the side walls of the valleys except in those dams where only {{one side of the}} valley is suitable for bearing. In these latter cases, the end of the dam straightens out, and the last section of gravity dam (where the weight of the dam itself resists the force of the water) then acts like a buttress to the more efficient <b>arch</b> <b>dam.</b>|$|E
25|$|Two {{types of}} single-arch dams are in use, namely the constant-angle and the constant-radius dam. The constant-radius type employs the same face radius at all {{elevations}} of the dam, {{which means that}} as the channel grows narrower towards {{the bottom of the}} dam the central angle subtended by the face of the dam becomes smaller. Jones Falls Dam, in Canada, is a constant radius dam. In a constant-angle dam, also known as a variable radius dam, this subtended angle is kept a constant and the variation in distance between the abutments at various levels are taken care of by varying the radii. Constant-radius dams are much less common than constant-angle dams. Parker Dam on the Colorado River is a constant-angle <b>arch</b> <b>dam.</b>|$|E
500|$|During the Roman period, {{the theory}} of {{building}} a curved dam (<b>arch</b> <b>dam)</b> {{was known as a}} means to withstand the water pressure and hold the masonry joints. However, in the background of masonry arch dams which dominated dam building scenario in the 19th century and with introduction of concrete technology for building dams, the structural design of arch dams underwent a dramatic change in its economic evolution to minimize use of construction material and inter alia, the cost of construction. Basically, an <b>arch</b> <b>dam</b> is a structure that curves upstream and the water pressure is transferred either directly to the valley sides or indirectly through concrete abutments. Theoretically, the ideal constant angle arch in a [...] "V"-shaped valley for such an <b>arch</b> <b>dam</b> has a central angle of 133° of curvature. This theory {{led to the development of}} the [...] "constant-angle" [...] (or variable radius) <b>arch</b> <b>dam,</b> which was also thinner in design. The theory was first initiated in North America for several dams, and in Alaska in particular, in 1913 with the building of the Salmon Creek Dam, which was completed in 1914. In this regard, Bartlett Lee Thane, the mining engineer, who made a lasting impact in the mining industry – in the Alaska-Gastineau Mining Company – [...] was instrumental in introducing this design of thin <b>arch</b> <b>dam</b> with help from his former football team mates. Lars Jorgensen evolved the specific first design of the constant <b>arch</b> <b>dam.</b> However, AEL gives design credit to their then Chief Engineer Harry L. Wallenberg for the Salmon Creek Dam. The idea for building such a dam had been thought about 30 years earlier to economize on the use of construction material for building the dam. However, it was only in 1913 that the concept was transformed on ground by the pioneer mining engineer Thane.|$|E
