5|$|Rose Tyler and the Doctor {{decide to}} visit Rose's mother Jackie. Jackie {{is pleased to}} see them, but makes a strangely happy remark that her {{deceased}} father will be joining them shortly. Despite Rose's protestations that her grandfather is dead, Jackie insists that he has returned and has been visiting her for some time. <b>A</b> <b>vaguely</b> humanoid and luminous silhouette appears in the flat, surprising both the Doctor and Rose but delighting Jackie before disappearing. TV broadcasts confirm {{that this is a}} worldwide phenomenon and Jackie explains that a few months previously millions of ghosts began appearing all over the world. Humans have come to accept them and believe that they are the manifestations of loved ones.|$|E
25|$|Like Tristan {{the subject}} of Pelléas is a love {{triangle}} set in <b>a</b> <b>vaguely</b> Medieval world. Unlike the protagonists of Tristan, the characters rarely seem to understand or be able to articulate their own feelings. The deliberate vagueness {{of the story is}} paralleled by the elusiveness of Debussy's music.|$|E
25|$|Another legend, {{based on}} the unusual ice {{patterns}} found on the northern cliff-face of the mountain, where <b>a</b> <b>vaguely</b> horse-shaped ice formation does not melt {{until late in the}} spring, state that the spirit of a local farmer's horse warns farmers against planting their crop so long as the ice formation remains on the mountain.|$|E

40|$|Given a group G, we {{show how}} one can define <b>a</b> <b>vague</b> group {{structure}} on G via {{a chain of}} subgroups of G. We discuss how a group homomorphism f from <b>a</b> <b>vague</b> group X onto a group Y induces <b>a</b> <b>vague</b> group structure on Y with f satisfying the vague homomorphism property. The notion of Ω-vague groups is introduced, where Ω is a fuzzy subset. The direct product G 1 × G 2 of two vague groups and the internal vague direct product of subgroups of <b>a</b> <b>vague</b> group is introduced. Vague group, fuzzy equality, vague binary operations, vague homomorphism...|$|R

25|$|The unusual {{finding in}} a deep chamber of Basua Cave in Savona, Italy, {{is thought to be}} related to cave bear worship, as there is <b>a</b> <b>vaguely</b> zoomorphic stalagmite {{surrounded}} by clay pellets. It was apparently used by Neanderthals for a ceremony; bear bones scattered on the floor further suggests this was likely to have had some sort of ritual purpose.|$|E
25|$|American house spiders are {{generally}} dull brown in coloration, with patterns of differing shades often giving <b>a</b> <b>vaguely</b> spotted appearance (particularly noticeable on the legs). Their average body size is a quarter-inch (6mm) long, {{but they can}} be an inch (2.5cm) or more across with legs outspread. Their size and coloration allow the spiders to blend into the background and escape notice.|$|E
25|$|In 1865 hatmaker John B. Stetson {{invented the}} Boss of the Plains hat. It gained {{immediate}} {{success in the}} Old West among cowboys and settlers, due to its practicality. It had <b>a</b> <b>vaguely</b> round ribbon-lined crown and a wide brim, originally straight but soon becoming stylized into the iconic rim of the typical cowboy hat. Its dense felt could be rugged enough to carry water.|$|E

60|$|I {{observed}} Oscar, next. His {{eyes were}} fixed on Lucilla--absorbed in watching her. He spoke to Nugent, without looking at him; animated, as it seemed, by <b>a</b> <b>vague</b> fear for Lucilla, which was slowly developing into <b>a</b> <b>vague</b> fear for himself.|$|R
5000|$|... (3) It is <b>a</b> <b>vague</b> concept. According to Robbins, “welfare” is <b>a</b> <b>vague</b> {{concept to}} use to define {{economics}} because it is subjective. Economics is a quantitative science; but welfare cannot be quantitatively measured, and two persons cannot agree on what creates or improves welfare.|$|R
25|$|When Hohenlohe {{heard about}} the {{encounter}} at Schleiz, he ordered the troops of his left wing to mass between Rudolstadt and Jena before moving east to the support of Tauentzien and the Saxons. However, Brunswick refused to allow the maneuver so Hohenlohe suspended it. In the meantime, Hohenlohe sent <b>a</b> <b>vaguely</b> worded order to Louis Ferdinand, which the prince misinterpreted as an order to defend Saalfeld. The Battle of Saalfeld occurred {{the next day in}} front of Lannes' left flank corps.|$|E
25|$|The Illinois Country was <b>a</b> <b>vaguely</b> defined region which {{included}} {{much of the}} present U.S. states of Indiana and Illinois. The area had {{been a part of}} the Louisiana district of New France until the end of the French and Indian War/Seven Years' War, when France ceded sovereignty of the region to the British in 1763 Treaty of Paris. In the Quebec Act of 1774, the British made the Illinois country a part of its newly expanded Province of Quebec.|$|E
25|$|The uplifted {{block of}} the Bellarine Peninsula forms a very weakly {{dissected}} undulating plain of low elevation, less than 150m. Drainage from the remnant basalts of the Palaeogene Older Volcanics forms <b>a</b> <b>vaguely</b> radial {{pattern on the}} elevated plateau. A narrow strip of deeply weathered Cretaceous Otway Group rocks occurs in outcrop along {{the southern edge of}} the Curlewis Monocline, which forms the northern boundary of the peninsula. Landslides and narrow gullies have formed along the northern edge of the monocline. A sheet of marine sands of Late Neogene age covers the southern portion of the uplifted Bellarine block.|$|E

25|$|He was by then enchanted {{with the}} idea of moving into a Western or Central European country, where he hoped to lead a more {{comfortable}} life and be closer to the centers of culture. He was especially interested in gaining easier access to the major stages for classical music, as a means to satisfy his desire for quality in that field (he had by then come to adore the compositions of Ludwig van Beethoven). According to Tudor Vianu, Caragiale was also showing signs {{that he was about to}} enter <b>a</b> <b>vaguely</b> misanthropic phase of his life.|$|E
25|$|The {{first day}} of the tour was a {{dramatic}} one, and it ended up being England’s most impressive one of the whole tour. Sri Lanka, having won the toss and chose to bat first, were reduced to 42/5 due to some highly impressive swing bowling by Matthew Hoggard. A 100 run partnership between Kumar Sangakkara (who top-scored with 92) and Prasanna Jayawardene (the keeper) followed to allow Sri Lanka to post <b>a</b> <b>vaguely</b> respectable score, but they were bowled out for 188. England made a confident reply, reaching 49/1 by the close of play, with the loss of Alastair Cook in the first over as the only blemish.|$|E
25|$|Continuing {{weight loss}} may {{deteriorate}} into wasting, <b>a</b> <b>vaguely</b> defined condition called cachexia. Cachexia differs from starvation {{in part because}} it involves a systemic inflammatory response. It is associated with poorer outcomes. In the advanced stages of progressive disease, metabolism can change so that they lose weight even when they are getting what is normally regarded as adequate nutrition and the body cannot compensate. This leads to a condition called anorexia cachexia syndrome (ACS) and additional nutrition or supplementation is unlikely to help. Symptoms of weight loss from ACS include severe weight loss from muscle rather than body fat, loss of appetite and feeling full after eating small amounts, nausea, anemia, weakness and fatigue.|$|E

25|$|Leopold {{responded in}} 1891 by sending two {{expedition}}s, and Sharpe's view {{seemed to be}} borne out. The Paul Le Marinel expedition only managed to obtain <b>a</b> <b>vaguely</b> worded letter (the Le Marinel letter) from Msiri agreeing to Free State agents having a presence in Katanga, but nothing more. This expedition was hampered by an accident when the gunpowder it was bringing for Msiri blew up, killing several men and damaging {{some of the other}} gifts being brought to sweeten the deal. A Belgian officer from the expedition, Legat, stayed behind with a group of askaris at a boma on the Lufoi River about 40km from Bunkeya {{to keep an eye on}} Msiri. (Msiri later accused Legat of actually having kept the supplies lost in the explosion for himself).|$|E
25|$|Anecdotally, gay {{cruising}} {{continued in}} post-war Singapore in back alleys, public parks and toilets. In the most part, this was {{ignored by the}} police and no one was charged under section 377 of the Singapore Penal Code. Meanwhile, transvestite prostitution in Bugis Street became increasingly prominent. The State and mainstream society initially accepted it is as <b>a</b> <b>vaguely</b> undesirable but inevitable vice, similar to the pragmatic and worldly attitudes towards prostitution in the cosmopolitan port-city. With their growing fame, the transvestites of Bugis Street became a tourist attraction, drawing local and foreign visitors every night. Bugis Street and its associated transgender community were by far the most visible face of sexual minorities in the immediate post-war period, much as transgender people had been in traditional Malay society. The difference was that the community was now much more public, urban and multi-ethnic. Prostitution and interaction with international visitors also added a new dimension to the life of this community.|$|E

Holiday does not take place on [...] "a specific date {{so much as it}} is the Holiday season, itself". Because Pastafarians [...] "reject dogma and formalism", there are no specific requirements for Holiday. Pastafarians celebrate Holiday in any manner they please. Pastafarians also celebrate [...] "Pastover" [...] as a parody of Passover, and [...] "Ramendan" [...] as a parody of Ramadan.|$|E
500|$|The task of {{designing}} the ZX81's case again fell to Rick Dickinson, who produced {{an updated version}} of the ZX80's wedge-shaped case. This time round, the design team were able to use injection moulding, which enabled them to deliver a higher-quality case. Dickinson originally envisaged the ZX81 as [...] "an expandable range of boxes following <b>a</b> <b>vaguely</b> modular approach with a common width", though this approach was eventually dropped. From start to finish, the design process took about six months.|$|E
500|$|Native Americans {{involved}} in Pontiac's Rebellion lived in <b>a</b> <b>vaguely</b> defined region of New France {{known as the}} pays d'en haut ("the upper country"), which was claimed by France until the Paris peace treaty of 1763. Native Americans of the pays d'en haut were from many different tribes. At this time and place, a [...] "tribe" [...] was a linguistic or ethnic group rather than a political unit. No chief spoke for an entire tribe, and no tribe acted in unison. For example, Ottawas {{did not go to}} war as a tribe: some Ottawa leaders chose to do so, while other Ottawa leaders denounced the war and stayed clear of the conflict.|$|E
