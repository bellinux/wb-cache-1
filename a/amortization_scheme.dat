40|$|Abstract—Signature <b>amortization</b> <b>schemes</b> {{have been}} {{introduced}} for authenticating multicast streams, in which, a single signature is amortized over several packets. The hash value of each packet is computed, some hash values are appended to other packets, forming {{what is known as}} hash chain. These schemes divide the stream into blocks, each block is a number of packets, the signature packet in these schemes is either the first or the last packet of the block. <b>Amortization</b> <b>schemes</b> are efficient solutions in terms of computation and communication overhead, specially in real-time environment. The main effictive factor of <b>amortization</b> <b>schemes</b> is it’s hash chain construction. Some studies show that signing the first packet of each block reduces the receiver’s delay and prevents DoS attacks, other studies show that signing the last packet reduces the sender’s delay. To our knowledge, there is no studies that show which is better, to sign the first or the last packet in terms of authentication probability and resistance to packet loss. In th is paper we will introduce another scheme for authenticating multicast streams that is robust against packet loss, reduces the overhead, and prevents the DoS attacks experienced by the receiver in the same time. Our scheme-The Multiple Connected Chain signing the First packet (MCF) is to append the hash values of specific packets to other packets,then append some hashes to the signature packet which is sent as the first packet in the block. This scheme is aspecially efficient in terms of receiver’s delay. We discuss and evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme against those that sign the last packet of the block.

40|$|Based on {{data from}} the Danish Stock Exchange, this paper {{analyses}} the value relevance of goodwill and goodwill amortization. Until Danish accounting legislation was changed as of January 1, 2002 companies were allowed to write-off goodwill or capitalize it subject to amortization, which provided a richer information set, as goodwill must be capitalized under most other accounting regimes. 1 The value relevance is tested by examining the association between goodwill (goodwill amortization) and share prices (share returns), incremental to other accounting variables. The overall findings suggest that investors perceive goodwill as an asset. Though the results concerning the value relevance of goodwill amortization were inconclusive, they indicate {{that the value of}} goodwill declines over time, consequently, goodwill may be regarded as a wasted asset, which is appropriately accounted for using some <b>amortization</b> <b>scheme</b> 1...|$|E

In the sense that the determination of the outstanding principal in accordance with the prospective, retrospective and of recurrence methods lead to conflicting  results. To this end, four different variations of the use of simple interest are numerically analyzed. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{rectilinear}} polygon cover {{problem is}} one in which a certain class of features of a rectilinear polygon of n vertices has to be covered with the minimum number of rectangles included in the polygon. In particular, one can consider covering the entire interior, the boundary and the set of corners of the polygon. These problems have important applications in, for example, storing images and in the manufacture of integrated circuits. In this paper we consider covering the corners of the polygons, also known as the corner-cover problem. In [4], it was shown that the corner cover problem is NP-hard and a simple O(n 1 : 5) -time approximation algorithm with performance ratio of 4 was presented. In this paper, we propose a non-trivial heuristic that approximates the corner cover problem for rectilinear polygons without holes within a ratio of 2 of the optimum in O(n log n) time. The analysis of the heuristic involves a very careful <b>amortization</b> <b>scheme</b> and we believe similar technique may b [...] ...|$|E

In the light of this, this study assesses the impact of public debt on external reserve in Nigeria. The objectives of this study include the assessment of the trends and relationship between public debt and external reserve in Nigeria, using the Johansen cointegration and FMOLS technique on the secondary data from 1981 to 2013. The result revealed that public debt has a positive and significant effect on external reserve stock in the long run suggesting that the nation’s debt crisis can be attributed to both exogenous and endogenous factors such as the nature of the economy, economic policies, high dependence on oil, and swindling foreign exchange receipt.

40|$|Several {{solutions}} {{had been}} introduced to authenticate streamed data delivered in real-time over insecure net-works, {{where there is no}} guarantee that every packet will be delivered. Some solutions resist any type of packet loss, others resist burst loss. <b>Amortization</b> <b>schemes</b> re-duce the overhead caused by other schemes, but suffer from several weak points, such as where to place the sig-nature packet, that is, after how many packets to send the signature. How many hashes to append to each packet, in addition to no clear chain structure analysis {{had been introduced}}, so as to show the effect on the ef-ficiency in terms of the authentication probability, loss resistance and overhead. In this paper we introduce a new chain construction for multicast stream authentica-tion delivered in real-time using signature amortization, giving solutions for the shortcomings. We also introduce a theoretical analysis of the chain construction to show its effect on the authentication efficiency. The proposed scheme consists of several odd-even chains, where the odd chains link some of the odd numbered packets, and the even chains link some of the even numbered ones. The scheme achieves better performance in terms of loss re-sistance and low overhead by changing the number of chains. That is when increasing the number of chains, low overhead and longer packet loss resistance are achieved. The sender’s buffer capacity is taken into consideration when choosing the number of chains. We also introduce equations to quantify the requirements such as the buffer size and delay on the receiver. ...|$|R
40|$|Six {{years after}} the {{financial}} crisis {{that led to the}} collapse of the banking system in 2008, the over-indebtedness of households {{is one of the most}} important problems in Iceland. This study aims to cast light on a specific feature of the Icelandic credit system in connection with the problem of over-indebtedness. The main research question is whether the end of indexation of credit is close or not. The author argues, in the first place, that indexation of credit ex-post to the consumer price index (CPI) in negative <b>amortization</b> <b>schemes</b> is responsible for over-indebtedness. In the second place, the author describes the challenges ahead in the field of consumer and mortgage credit in Iceland in the light of European law (European Union EU and European Economic Area EEA). The incorporation of Directive 2008 / 48 on credit agreement for consumers to the Icelandic domestic order through the EEA Agreement allowed a preliminary legal review of the practice in light of EU/EEA consumer credit law, both at national and European level without a final conclusion. It has nevertheless led to the judicial review on the legality of some indexation alleged malpractices before national courts and to the EFTA Court for interpretation (mostly on Directives 93 / 13 /EEC on unfair terms 87 / 102 /EEC on consumer credit). A ruling from the Supreme Court is expected on several cases. A critical battle between the legality, the fairness and the legitimacy of indexation of credit is taking place in Iceland under the influence of European law. </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{graph-based}} new <b>amortization</b> <b>scheme</b> for multicast streams authentication that achieves stronger resistance against packet loss {{and reduces the}} overhead in the same time. The hash chains of the existing amortization schemes have no systematic way to construct them, the construction had been determined by simulation. These schemes lack the theoretical model that helps in determining {{the values of the}} parameters and measuring the efficiency metrics of the authentication schemes. The proposed scheme in this paper consists of multiple connected chains, each chain connects some packets together. The parameters values of the hash chain of our scheme is determined in advance and the hash chain is constructed systematically. We also introduce mathematical tools that help in measuring the efficiency metrics such the authentication probability, the loss resistance and the overhead. The number of chains in our model plays the main role in the efficiency of our scheme in terms of loss resistance and overhead. High authentication probability can be achieved by increasing the number of hashes that are appended to the signature packet and by increasing the number of packets that contain the hash of a previous packet...|$|E
