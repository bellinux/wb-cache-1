25|$|Studies of {{a speech}} {{community}} that presuppose the existence of that community may reproduce stereotypes that fail to accurately depict the social reality of variance among subgroups within a community and overlapping identities for individuals.

25|$|Officially, second-generation Americans are U.S. {{citizens}} by birth. U.S. {{citizenship is}} guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; but political debate over repealing this right {{has increased in}} recent years. Advocates of this motion claim that this right attracts unauthorized immigration to the U.S. The repeal of birthright citizenship would have {{the greatest impact on}} second-generation <b>Americans</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> Mexican Americans, as Mexico is the country of origin for the majority of undocumented immigrants in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|In the United States {{the term}} {{liberalism}} has become {{associated with the}} welfare state and expanded regulatory policies created {{as a result of}} the New Deal and its offshoots from the 1930s onwards. Fiscal conservatives form one of the three legs of the traditional conservative movement in the United States, together with social conservatism and national defense conservatism. Many <b>Americans</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> classical liberals also tend to identify as Libertarian, holding more socially liberal views and advocating a non-interventionist foreign policy while supporting lower taxes and less government spending.|$|E

25|$|Although {{much of the}} {{pomp and}} {{ceremony}} behind the State of the Union address is governed by tradition rather than law, in modern times, the event is seen {{as one of the}} most important in the US political calendar. It is one of the few instances when all three branches of the US government are assembled under one roof: members of both houses of Congress constituting the legislature, the President's Cabinet constituting the executive, and the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court constituting the judiciary. In addition, the military is represented by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, while foreign governments are represented by the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps. The address has also been used as an opportunity to honor the achievements of some ordinary <b>Americans,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> typically invited by the President to sit with the First Lady.|$|E
25|$|A poll by The Barna Group in 2004 found Catholic {{ethnicity}} to be 60% non-Hispanic white (generally {{of mixed}} ethnicity, but almost always includes {{at least one}} Catholic ethnicity such as Irish, Italian, German, Polish, or French), 31% Hispanic of any nationality (mostly Mexicans), 4% Black , and 5% other ethnicity (mostly Filipinos and other Asian Americans, <b>Americans</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> multiracial and have mixed ethnicities, and American Indians). Among the non-Hispanic whites, about 16 million Catholics identify as being of Irish descent, about 13 million as German, about 12 million as Italian, about 7 million as Polish, and about 5 million as French (note that many identify {{with more than one}} ethnicity). The roughly 7.8 million Catholics who are converts (mainly from Protestantism, with a smaller number from irreligion or other religions) are also mostly non-Hispanic white, including many people of British, Dutch, and Scandinavian ancestry.|$|E

25|$|American Jews, or Jewish Americans, are <b>Americans</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> Jews, {{whether by}} religion, {{ethnicity}} or nationality. The current Jewish {{community in the}} United States consists primarily of Ashkenazi Jews, who comprise about 90% of the American Jewish population. Most American Ashkenazim are US-born, with a dwindling number of now elderly earlier immigrants, {{as well as some}} more recent foreign-born immigrants. During the colonial era, prior to the mass immigration of Ashkenazim, Spanish and Portuguese Jews represented the bulk of America's then small Jewish population, and while their descendants are a minority today, they along with an array of other Jewish communities represented the remainder of American Jews, including other more recent Sephardic Jews, Mizrahi Jews, various other ethnically Jewish communities, as well as a smaller number of converts to Judaism. The American Jewish community manifests a wide range of Jewish cultural traditions, encompassing the full spectrum of Jewish religious observance.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{there are}} few reports about how many people disaffiliating from Islam in Muslim {{majority}} countries. The main {{reason for this is}} the social and legal repercussions associated with leaving Islam in many Muslim majority countries, up to and including the death penalty for apostasy. However, the report also suggest that in future, {{it is also possible that}} these societies could allow for greater freedom to religiously disaffiliate. On the other hand the increasingly large ex-Muslim communities in the Western world that adhere to no religion have been well documented. A 2007 Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) report argued that some Muslim population projections are overestimated, as they assume that all descendants of Muslims will become Muslims even in cases of mixed parenthood. Equally, Darren E. Sherkat questioned in Foreign Affairs whether some of the Muslim growth projections are accurate as they do not take into account the increasing number of non-religious Muslims. Quantitative research is lacking, but he believes the European trend mirrors the American: data from the General Social Survey in the United States show that 32 percent of those raised Muslim no longer embrace Islam in adulthood, and 18 percent hold no religious identification. Studies show that about half of the 4.2 million persons from Muslim background in Germany are no longer embrace Islam in adulthood. Many of the Muslims who leaves Islam faces social rejection or imprisonment and sometimes murder or penalty. According to Harvard University professor Robert D. Putnam, there is increasing numbers of <b>Americans</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> leaving their faith and becoming unaffiliated and the average Iranian is slightly less religious than the average American. According to Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans, the number of Iranian Americans Muslims decreased from 42% in 2008 to 31% in 2012. On the other hand, conversion into Islam have also been well documented.|$|E

500|$|Canadians {{and native}} <b>Americans</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> less {{influenced}} by Williams' narrative and Turner's thesis, {{have given the}} raid a more ambivalent place in memory. Canadians view the raid not as a massacre and mass abduction but as a successful local application of guerilla techniques in the broader context of international war and stress the successful integration of hundreds of captives taken in similar conflicts during Queen Anne's War. [...] Similarly, most Native American records justify the action in a larger military and cultural context and remain largely unconcerned with the particular event.|$|E
500|$|In his pamphlets, Townsend {{speaks out}} against boycotting {{products}} from Japan, noting that America does considerably more trade with Japan than China and arguing that peaceful trade with Japan and Nazi Germany would {{serve the interests}} of American workers and consumers. He blames [...] "red elements" [...] within China for starting the Second Sino-Japanese War, but praises Japan for the [...] "humane" [...] manner in which its armed forces have behaved in China, believing that it is only the Soviet Union and [...] "a powerful minority" [...] of pro-communist <b>Americans</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> conspiring to push America to war with Japan. Townsend predicts that if the Chinese won their war with Japan, the result would be a communist takeover of China, but he dismisses the idea that Japan might launch an attack on the United States as [...] "simply too idiotic to discuss." [...] On Europe he avers similarly that German conduct is largely a defensive reaction to British and French attempts to [...] "obliterate the Germans as an entity".|$|E
