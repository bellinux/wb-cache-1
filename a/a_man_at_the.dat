5|$|The western face {{is divided}} into three sections. The {{uppermost}} section is almost completely weathered. The antiquarian Alexander Gordon, who described the stone in 1726 in his Itinerarium Septentrionale, records this panel as holding a crucifixion scene, with the figure of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> right hand side and the left side completely defaced.

5|$|The video {{opens with}} a scene of the ocean at night. It then shows a mansion by the water, in which Buena is seen {{standing}} by a balcony. The following scene shows Range entering the mansion as two men open the doors for her. Buena is shown walking {{in the middle of}} a masquerade ball, in which she captures the attention of a man. The Sugababes are shown on a couch, where Buchanan holds a man's hand; they all then walk down the mansion's staircase. Each group member begins to dance with <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ball. Buena walks towards a mirror which depicts a reflection of the Sugababes, while Buchanan drops her white mask which subsequently shatters. Towards the end of the video, they are shown leaving the ball before Buchanan jumps off the balcony and into the water. All three members are shown collectively in the water, which begins to fade out into the sky. The last scene shows the men that were in the mansion walking away.|$|E

25|$|During {{the nine}} years {{he lived in}} Newcastle, Nicholson {{published}} three more books, his Treatise on Projection (1837) containing his portrait, drawn from life by Edward Train, originally in pen and ink. Nicholson's final work was entitled The Guide to Railway Masonry, containing a Complete Treatise on the Oblique Arch and published on 1 January 1839, the third edition of which also contained the portrait by Train. The contrast between this and the earlier portrait by Green is marked: Green painted <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> peak of his vigour, while Train drew a much older and poorer man.|$|E

25|$|In 1903, Petre was {{appointed}} Consular Agent for Italy in Dunedin {{following the death}} of Edward Cargill.

Unusually for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> peak of his profession, Petre was known as congenial and popular. He died at Dunedin, in December 1918, following 42 years of architectural practice and two days after the opening of the finally completed St Patrick's Basilica, Oamaru. He was buried at the Andersons Bay Cemetery, Dunedin. The building was gutted by fire in the 1940s, and is today a preserved ruin.|$|E

The victim suffered serious stab wounds to the neck, back and leg and required approximately fifty stitches. Several other men fled the scene, but Finnerty and Beniusis detained two suspects until the arrival of Gardaí.|$|E

25|$|To be an enlisted woman {{during the}} {{creation}} stages was not easy. Besides {{the fact that}} everyone was learning as they went, they did not receive the support they needed from the male recruits. Women were initially paid two-thirds of what <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same level made. As the war progressed the military leaders {{began to see the}} substantial impact the women could make. In many cases the women had outperformed their male counterparts. This was taken into account and the women received a raise to four-fifths of the wages of a man. A female doctor however, received equal financial compensation to her male counterpart. One commander argued that it would be impossible for female recruits to reach the location of his station, even though it was located only three and a half miles from the city and was serviced by a paved road and a bus route The negative reaction of men towards the female recruits was addressed in propaganda films. Proudly She Marches and Wings on Her Shoulder were made to show the acceptance of female recruits, while showing the men that although they were taking jobs traditionally intended for men, {{they would be able to}} retain their femininity.|$|E

The lawyers, and the National Chapter of the NAACP, also felt that having Mr. Brown {{at the head of}} the roster would be better received by the U.S. Supreme Court Justices. The 13 plaintiffs were: Oliver Brown, Darlene Brown, Lena Carper, Sadie Emmanuel, Marguerite Emerson, Shirley Fleming, Zelma Henderson, Shirley Hodison, Maude Lawton, Alma Lewis, Iona Richardson, and Lucinda Todd. The last surviving plaintiff, Zelma Henderson, died in Topeka, on May 20, 2008, at age 88.|$|E
500|$|Passing sentence, Rafferty said: [...] "You robbed three {{innocent}} {{ladies of}} their lives.

The brutality of these ladies' deaths, designed by you to evade discovery, showing the coldness with which you dispatched them, is appalling. You should clearly have faced up like <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> overwhelming nature of the Crown's case against you but you chose to put the victims' families through misery which you compounded by this trial."
