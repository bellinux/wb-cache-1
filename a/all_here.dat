One of his most important territorial accretions, the principality of Halych-Volynia, was obtained by the marriage of his son Lubart with the daughter of the Galician prince.|$|E

A band, there to play for a show of Ford Motor Company cars outside, began playing Hail, Hail the Gang's <b>All</b> <b>Here</b> and There'll be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight. The celebration was so loud that it was most likely heard by the second jury waiting inside.|$|E
25|$|To {{the north}} of Raise the {{pedestrian}} route of Sticks Pass crosses the ridge at a height of 2,445ft (745m), this being the highest pass in the District crossed by a regular bridleway.

The name is believed to be taken from the guideposts originally used to mark the route. The becks flowing from either side of the pass summit are both officially named Sticks Gill, the '(East)' and '(West)' having been added by Alfred Wainwright in his Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells and utilised by later guidebook writers.

25|$|In 1939, Broadway {{producer}} Lee Shubert offered Miranda an eight-week {{contract to}} perform in The Streets of Paris after seeing her at Cassino da Urca in Rio de Janeiro. The following year she made her first Hollywood film, Down Argentine Way with Don Ameche and Betty Grable, and her exotic clothing and Latin accent became her trademark. That year, she was voted the third-most-popular personality in the United States; she and her group, Bando da Lua, were invited to sing and dance for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1943 Miranda starred in Busby Berkley's The Gang's <b>All</b> <b>Here,</b> which was noted for its musical numbers with the fruit hats that became her trademark. By 1945, she was the highest-paid woman in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Many music {{critics and}} audiences praised The Downward Spiral for its abrasive, eclectic nature and dark themes and {{commented on the}} concept of a {{destruction}} of a man. The New York Times writer Jon Pareles' review of the album found the music to be highly abrasive. Pareles asserted that unlike other electro-industrial groups like Ministry and Nitzer Ebb, [...] "Reznor writes full-fledged tunes" [...] with stronger use of melodies than riffs. He noticed criticisms of Nine Inch Nails from industrial purists for popularizing the genre and the album's transgression. Robert Christgau gave the album an honorable mention (...) rating and commented that, musically, the album was comparable to [...] "Hieronymus Bosch as postindustrial atheist", but lyrically more closely resembled [...] "Transformers as kiddie porn." [...] Jonathan Gold, writing for Rolling Stone, likened the album to cyberpunk fiction. Entertainment Weekly reviewer Tom Sinclair commented: [...] "Reznor's pet topics (sex, power, S, hatred, transcendence) are <b>all</b> <b>here,</b> wrapped in hooks that hit your psyche with the force of a blowtorch." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely mixed. Zack Handlen of The A.V.

[...] He argued that the episode was [...] "so effective" [...] because it [...] "isn't just the inversion of the monster/normal personal dichotomy; the show has pulled that trick before, and while it tries to play coy about {{the true nature of}} the soul eater at first, it's not hard to recognize who the real villain is." [...] Handlen also wrote that the episode both [...] "forces the audience to identify more strongly with Doggett" [...] and made good use of Anderson's absence. Meghan Deans of Tor.com felt that, while [...] "the tale of the soul eater may have been a little rushed and a little sloppy", the episode itself [...] "has a spark to it [...] spark of the absent, the drive of the missing. The feeling that we’re <b>all</b> <b>here</b> for a reason, and that the show wants to live." ...|$|E

500|$|The Navy Times had {{previously}} reported the transfer resulted from Sestak forcing subordinates to work unreasonable hours, although Sestak himself disputed that accusation and attributed the {{transfer to the}} fact that the new top officer, Admiral Michael Mullen, simply wanted to appoint his own team. Sestak called on Specter to stop broadcasting the commercial, accusing the Senator of [...] "Republican-style" [...] negative campaign tactics, which he compared to those used against Senator John Kerry by the Swift Vets and POWs for Truth during the 2004 presidential election. Sestak said in a statement, [...] "It's time to tell Arlen Specter: Democrats don't 'swift boat'. We're better than that." [...] A group of veterans gathered in Philadelphia to echo Sestak's call that the commercial should be removed, with retired U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Robert E. Kelley announcing, [...] "We're <b>all</b> <b>here</b> because we're enraged at the fact that someone, anyone, in the United States today would question someone who has 30 years of service." [...] Specter's campaign replied they would not remove the commercial because it was accurate, and instead called on Sestak to remove his own advertisement, claiming it violated United States Department of Defense guidelines because it used military images, references and jargon without a disclaimer that it was not endorsed by the department.|$|E

Though she believed that it was not Madonna's best video, nevertheless it was successful as a release. Christopher Farley from The Washington Post gave another positive review, saying that the singer [...] "appears to be in better shape than many college students, which is crazy" [...] and also complimented her for picking [...] "M.I.A. and Nicki Minaj–and getting them to literally serve as cheerleaders for the Madonna brand." [...] MTV News' Jocelyn Vena described it as [...] "funky, fun and surreal (and almost cartoony)" [...] as well as fun and light-hearted: [...] "Madonna looks like she's having an incredibly fun time throughout the visual, smiling and shimmying her way through this fictional, hyper-fantasy world. Watching the clip, one may wonder what doesn't happen in the video." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Collum {{wrote for}} AbsolutePunk that Tell All Your Friends [...] "grabs the listener’s {{attention}} from the start" [...] and the album expressed [...] "feelings that are completely genuine, not contrived, rehearsed or formulaic, without being over-the-top or sappy". Collum called Lazzara and Nolan's vocal delivery [...] "rapid-fire" [...] in a [...] "back-and-forth way, {{as if they were}} carrying on a dialogue, [...] allows you to really attach to and {{get a sense of the}} raw emotion behind the songs". In a retrospective review for Alternative Press, Brendan Manley wrote that the album [...] "is as close as it gets to a modern masterpiece, capturing not just a band at their apex, but an entire scene". According to Manley, Tell All Your Friends was [...] "the crossover breaking point, finally bringing what had been percolating for years in East Coast VFW Halls to the attention of the masses". Channing Freeman of Sputnikmusic wrote that the album features [...] "power chords and clean strums and palm muting and reverb". About whether this was negative, Freeman said, [...] "With songs this good, it shouldn't be ... It's <b>all</b> <b>here,</b> solid and undeniably catchy". Jonathan Bradley wrote for Stylus Magazine that although the album [...] "is notable not so much for being a blueprint as it is a playbook", it would [...] "provide the perfect How-To guide for teenagers with guitars all over the United States and beyond." ...|$|E

[...] The San Jose Mercury News noted that Villas [...] "turns his meticulous eye to the cured pork product" [...] in the book, which includes [...] "recipes featuring bacon in every imaginable way". The Winston-Salem Journal observed, [...] "His history of bacon, short and to the point, should be required reading for bacon lovers." [...] The Baltimore Sun highlighted the book in an article [...] "Gifts to savor", commenting that [...] "James Villas covers everything about this trendy ingredient". Marialisa Calta of The Douglas Daily Dispatch wrote, [...] "in the unusual-but-oddly-compelling-single-subject-cookbook category, props go to “The Bacon Cookbook” by James Villas". Writing for the Star Tribune, Lee Svitak Dean recommended the book as a holiday gift for cooks, commenting, [...] "It's <b>all</b> <b>here,</b> from guacamole and bacon canapés to New England apple and bacon griddlecakes and German fennel and bacon soup." [...] "No publishing season is complete without a bacon book," [...] wrote Kristen Browning-Blas of The Denver Post, who noted that Joanna Pruess's Seduced by Bacon was released the previous year. The New York Daily News noted that the book [...] "includes an introductory primer on the many wondrous bacon varieties along with easy-to-follow instruction for more than 150 international dishes, from guacamole with bacon to bacon-duck stew." [...] The Independent highlighted the book as number 11 on a list of [...] "The 50 Best Cookbooks", commenting, [...] "Bacon is a standard choice for many a simple supper, but there is nothing standard about Villas's book. The irresistible smell of bacon oozes from the pages, as Villas shows the versatility of bacon, even bacon desserts– for example, bacon and peanut butter chocolate truffles.

2500|$|In 1943, she {{appeared}} in Busby Berkeley's The Gang's <b>All</b> <b>Here.</b> Berkeley's musicals were known for lavish production, and Miranda's role as Dorita featured [...] "The Lady in the Tutti-Frutti Hat". A special effect made her fruit-bedecked hat appear larger than possible. By then she was typecast as an exotic songstress, and under her studio contract she was obligated to make public appearances in her ever-more-outlandish film costumes. One of her records, [...] "I Make My Money With Bananas" [...] seemed to pay ironic tribute to her typecasting. The Gang's <b>All</b> <b>Here</b> was one of 1943's 10 highest-grossing films and Fox's most expensive production of the year.
