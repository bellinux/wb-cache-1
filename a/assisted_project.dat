50|$|Arguably, the PIADP people, {{intentionally}} or unintentionally, blindsided {{the donors}} of this negative impact {{to secure their}} continued funding under Phase II while working on their tenure and mandates to become a law by R.A. 7611 (SEP Law http://www.pcsd.ph/sep_law/ra7611.htm, Sec. 20).

The Khmer Serei knew the terrain and language well and therefore were invaluable to the mission. According to one U.S. Army commander, the Khmer Serei were good soldiers:They knew the border area, could communicate with the local populations, and could get intelligence about the Viet Cong and what they were doing in their sanctuaries across the border.|$|E

The fieldwork involved geophysical survey at the fort and The Parade, followed by trial excavation of anomalies. Trial trenches at The Parade exposed several rich midden deposits and material providing evidence for the burning of the town of Maryburgh, as suggested in contemporary accounts in 1746. The results at the fort were not so positive, as most traces of the garrison were removed in the 19 th and 20 th centuries through its use as a railway yard; however, a trench outside the fort suggests survival of midden deposits pre-dating this period of destruction.

40|$|Abstract — In the {{industry}} computer assisted technologies are being implemented very fast. Most companies {{support the use}} of the new computer assisted technologies as a fully integrated digital policy. Currently, due to the high number of available alternatives in the market, the integration analysis of the computer assisted conception and production technologies is a critical study, in order to establish the potential for a full implementation of a CIM (Computer Integrated Manufacture) strategy. The technology developments in the area of computer <b>assisted</b> <b>project</b> and production of prototypes is reviewed in this paper. The text is divided in five main topics, namely: i) an introduction to the characteristics of actual markets requirements and demands of clients that lead to the need of new methods and equipments to be used by the production companies, ii) a review about the available capabilities on computer assisted conception and production technologies (computer-aided design / engineering / manufacturing and rapid prototyping); iii) an analysis about product designer standards and requirements (an example concerning the making of working drawings is used to illustrate the actual constraints in the computer assisted technologies); and iv) conclusions regarding {{the state of the art}} and future developments preview in the area.

40|$|Bohol has {{the biggest}} {{mangrove}} area (natural and plantation) {{in the whole}} Visayas with only two coastal towns, out of 28 city and municipalities have no mangroves. The province has also the richest biodiversity in Central Visayas and probably the whole country (Primavera, 2000). The 1, 400 ha mangroves of Cogtong Bay, Candijay has 33 mangroves species (Yao, 1999). No wonder it has five Mangrove Ecotourism Destinations run by either LGUs or Peoples Organization assisted by DENR / NGOs. The Province has some rich historical background on community based management in mangroves: 1) with Banacon Island as the first awardees of Certificate of Steward Contract (CSC) in Mangroves in 1980 s, the tenurial instrument given by DENR to farmers in timberland areas and to fishermen dependent on mangroves {{in order to protect}} and conserve the forest; 2) Talibon, the first Co-Management Project in Mangroves in the country. This is an agreement between DENR and LGU, where the latter is mandated to lead in the development and protection of the natural resources within the municipality. The agreement was facilitated by the Ecological Governance (Eco-Gov) Project, a USAID <b>assisted</b> <b>project</b> in 2004; 3) Banacon, the first large scale community-based mangrove afforestation sans assistance from government or NGOs.

40|$|With a {{population}} of about 13 million (UNDP 2001), Lagos, the former capital city of Nigeria, is one of the emerging megacities in the 21 st century. As a center of urban agglomeration, Lagos has an unfair, unreliable and chaotic land market leading to improper planning for both real estate and other urban services; this has been exacerbated by the absence of appropriate databases for accurate land information. An important component of the current globalization of world economies is the plan for privatization of land and real estate development by the Lagos state government. In this context, research has shown that modern technological development will stimulate modernization, and make the city more viable for investment. Concerned groups often believe the geographic information systems and technologies as an important component of sustainable land-use (World bank, USAID). Yet, despite the efforts of these multilateral development partners, the development of a geographic information system for sustainable planning is far from achieving the desired results. This paper will look at the World Bank <b>assisted</b> <b>project</b> from which a GIS was used and the current in-house GIS project by the land registry. If the adoption of GIS by the developed nations is a means to an end, what are the criteria on which policy makers in Nigeria can be persuaded to adopt GIS? Is it true that what is good for one society may not be good for another? How can the culture of ‘technology distrust’ be removed so that people of Lagos can accept this innovative technology? This paper is aimed at encouraging the diffusion and adoption of GIS across a broad spectrum of the Lagos state administration, by improving the understanding of the roles of a GIS in development. It shall present two case studies from ‘GIS strong’ nations such as Australia and New Zealand where there is evidence that government is reaping the benefits of a geographic information systems and technology in resource management...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT An {{imperative}} step {{in designing}} a framework which should <b>assist</b> <b>project</b> {{managers in the}} decision making consists of the validation of the framework. Validation aims at finding {{whether or not the}} framework does what it is intended to do. However, absolute validation is a myth. To be as sure as possible that the framework is valid, years of testing and experimenting is inevitable. This is not feasible for this research. Therefore, in this only three validation techniques are applied. The result of these tests will not indicate whether or not the framework is valid but it will show {{whether or not it is}} a useable tool. To find out if the framework is doing what is intended, it is necessary to state the expectation. The framework designed should <b>assist</b> <b>project</b> managers in selecting an appropriate software development process in accordance with the particular project at hand...|$|R
