40|$|Abstract. <b>Acceptance</b> <b>testing</b> is a {{necessary}} stage in any complex procurement, as it determines whether the supplier has satisfied {{the requirements of the}} contract. Over the next ten years the Department of Defence will acquire several new platform training simulators that support distributed team training, including the Airborne Early Warning & Control operational mission simulator, AP- 3 C advanced flight and operational mission simulators, Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter simulator, Super Seasprite full flight mission simulator, and FFG Upgrade onboard training system and team trainer. To ensure networked interoperability between training simulators, it is essential that they be tested thoroughly against the relevant distributed simulation standards. Air Operations Division, DSTO, has been tasked to assist the testing of the aforementioned simulators. To streamline this work, a uniform <b>procedure</b> for <b>testing</b> distributed training enabled simulators has been developed. This paper defines distributed simulation concepts with regard to platform training simulators, and describes the <b>acceptance</b> <b>testing</b> <b>procedure.</b> Whilst the procedure is applicable to modern distributed simulation standards, emphasis has been placed on the use of Distributed Interactive Simulation and the High Level Architecture Real-time Platform Reference Federation Object Model (RPR-FOM), as the majority of new platform training simulators will employ these standards.

40|$|Fuzz {{testing is}} an industry-standard {{technique}} for locating unknown vulnerabilities in software. Fuzz testing is mandatory portion of many modern secure software development life cycles (SDLCs), {{such as those}} used at Adobe, Cisco Systems and Microsoft. This document provides a framework to assess the maturity of your processes, software, systems and devices. At {{the heart of this}} document is a maturity model for fuzz testing that maps metrics and procedures of effective fuzz testing to maturity levels. The maturity model is a lingua franca for talking about fuzzing, allowing different organizations to communicate effectively about fuzzing without being tied to specific tools. A key benefit of this model is that it enables organizations to make informed decisions about the time and resources needed to perform fuzz testing as part of product development or product verification. Furthermore, it helps you plan and understand where you are with your fuzzing efforts. Even if your product development, validation, or <b>acceptance</b> <b>testing</b> <b>procedures</b> do not adhere to one of the aforementioned SDLCs, fuzzing remains a crucial technique for locating vulnerabilities in software. This version of FTMM focuses on defining a framework which allows comparing and exchanging information about fuzzing using measurable and interchangeable metrics.

40|$|The {{development}} of a new increased range higher visibility was investigated. The visibility sensor that is currently is the Transmissometer. Current transmissometer technology provides only a factor of 10 dynamic range with a single base line. The FAA is preparing to install automated weather observing systems (AWOS) at many locations. These systems require visibilities up to approximately 5 miles. To use a transmissometer for this type of measurement, the base line must be about 1, 000 feet; where alignment becomes very difficult to maintain. New technologies were developd for measuring visibility. Improved transmissometers, forward-scatter meters and back-scatter meters have become available. A current practical issue for visibility sensors is how to specify one that is good enough {{to meet the needs of}} aviation. The first question is what performance is required; how accurately must the sensor measure? Visibility sensors do not actually measure the visibility directly. The purpose of measuring the visibility is to predict what the pilot will see a considerable distance away from the sensor location. The atmosphere introduces considerable variation in the measurement and the basic sensor accuracy needed is difficult to define. The second question for high visibilities is what to use as the standard reference sensor. The third question pertains to the competitive procurement of visibility sensors, which is mandated at present. Two <b>acceptance</b> <b>test</b> <b>procedures</b> to be used to insure satisfactory sensor performance is examined...|$|R

40|$|LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1) To {{demonstrate}} {{the importance of}} the quality assurance (QA) of radiation treatment planning systems (RTPS) by reviewing significant treatment errors associated with their use. 2) To review the major functionality of a modern RTPS. 3) To highlight and summarize various reports that have made recommendations regarding acceptance, commissioning and QA of RTPSs with special emphasis on IEC- 62083 and IAEA TRS- 430. 4) To discuss accuracy requirements and criteria of acceptability of the modern RTPS. 5) To summarize <b>acceptance</b> <b>testing</b> <b>procedures</b> as proposed by the IAEA for a modern RTPS. 6) To provide an overview of commissioning a modern RTPS. 7) To provide an overview of the quality control associated with a modern RTPS. ABSTRACTDuring the last decade there has been a technological revolution in radiation oncology. Enhanced use of imaging combined with computer-controlled methods of dose delivery provides a capability of escalating tumor doses without increasing morbidity. A pivotal component of this modern technology is the computerized radiation treatment planning system (RTPS) which is used to develop optimal treatment techniques for individual patients. Modern RTPSs make increased use of patient images, enhanced 3 -D displays, more sophisticated dose calculation algorithms, more complex treatment plan evaluation tools, combined with the generation of images which can be used for treatment verification. The implementation of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) combined with automated optimization software has added a further complexity to the RTPS. In recent years, various national and international organizations have developed reports that have made recommendations regarding the commissioning and quality assurance (QA) of RTPSs. In 1998, the AAPM published the TG 53 report giving guidelines for users and vendors on QA for radiation therapy planning. In 2000, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) produced a report (IEC 62083) identifying safety requirements for manufacturers of RTPSs. In 2004, both the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the European Society of Therapeutic Radiation Oncology (ESTRO) published reports on commissioning and QA of RTPSs. Furthermore, the IAEA has recently developed a protocol for the <b>acceptance</b> <b>testing</b> of RTPSs. In 2006, the Netherlands Commission of Radiation Dosimetry also produced a report on QA of RTPSs. All of these reports indicate that a thorough commissioning of a modern 3 -D RTPS has become a daunting task. This refresher course will specifically look at the IEC and IAEA reports and review issues associated with <b>acceptance</b> <b>testing,</b> commissioning, and quality assurance of the modern RTPS.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the NIF Site Management Plan is to {{describe}} the roles, responsibilities, and interfaces for the major NIF Project organizations involved in construction of the facility, installation and <b>acceptance</b> <b>testing</b> of special equipment, and the NIF activation. The plan also describes the resolution of priorities and conflicts. The period covered is from Critical Decision 3 (CD 3) through {{the completion of the}} Project. The plan is to be applied in a stepped manner. The steps are dependent on different elements of the project being passed from the Conventional Facilities (CF) Construction Manager (CM), to the Special Equipment (SE) CMs, and finally to the Activation/ Start-Up (AS) CM. These steps are defined as follows: The site will be coordinated by CF through Project Milestone 310, end of conventional construction. The site is defined as the fenced area surrounding the facility and the CF laydown and storage areas. The building utilities that are installed by CF will be coordinated by CF through the completion of Project Milestone 310, end of conventional construction. The building utilities are defined as electricity, compressed air, de-ionized water, etc. Upon completion of the CF work, the Optics Assembly Building/Laser and Target Area Building (OAB/LTAB) will be fully operational. At that time, an Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) Program building coordinator will become responsible for utilities and site activities. * Step 1. Mid-commissioning (temperature stable, + 1 {degree}C) of an area (e. g., Laser Bay 2, OAB) will precipitate the turnover of that area (within the four walls) from CF to SE. * Step 2. Interior to the turned-over space, SE will manage all interactions, including those necessary by CF. * Step 3. As the SE <b>acceptance</b> <b>testing</b> <b>procedures</b> (ATPS) are completed, AS will take over the management of the area and coordinate all interactions necessary by CF and SE. For each step, the corresponding CMs for CF, SE, or AS will be placed in charge of the integrated activities within a space.

40|$|Materials {{selection}} for spacecraft {{is based on}} conventional flammability or ignition sensitivity <b>acceptance</b> <b>tests.</b> Current <b>procedures</b> for determining the inter-laboratory repeatability and reproducibility of aerospace materials flammability tests are not considering the dependence of data variability on test conditions and consequently attempts to characterize the precision of these methods were not successful. The inter-laboratory data variability is determined with tests conducted under arbitrary conditions, which consequently may not provide sufficient information to enable adequate determination of a method's precision. For evaluating the precision of NASA's flammability test methods, the protocol recommended includes selecting critical parameters and determining the 50 % failure point by considering the specific failure criteria of each method using the critical parameter as a variable. Upon performing inter-laboratory round robin testing using this approach, the laboratories' performance could be evaluated by comparing the repeatability of the 50 % failure point and/or the repeatability of critical conditions where the probabilities of passing and failing are unity, i. e., the transition zone repeatability. When a sufficient amount of data has been acquired with this method, an adequate estimation of precision of aerospace materials flammability test methods will be possible...|$|R
