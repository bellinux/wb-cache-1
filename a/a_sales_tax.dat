5|$|Off the field, the Mariners' AL West {{championship}} {{as well as}} its memorable run in {{the postseason}} served as a catalyst for public funding for a new ballpark. Less than two weeks before the tiebreaker, the residents of King County, Washington (whose county seat is Seattle) voted against <b>a</b> <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> increase to fund a new stadium, but shortly after their ALDS victory, the Washington State Legislature reconvened and approved a separate funding package for a new stadium. The new stadium, now called Safeco Field, opened in July 1999.|$|E
5|$|Corzine, in {{attempting}} to pass his conceptual budget, came into conflict with fellow state Democrats in the New Jersey General Assembly, particularly over their refusal to implement his proposed increase of the state's sales tax from 6% to 7% to fill a $4.5 billion budget gap. Corzine maintained that the gap could not be filled by any other means due to the state's constitution and a ruling of New Jersey's Supreme Court. Long before the deadline date, Corzine had stated {{that he would not}} accept a budget that did not include <b>a</b> <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> increase. Due to Corzine's insistence, the state's General Assembly, which was dominated by Democrats, refused to pass a budget before the deadline.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} the simple analytics {{of the four}} main types of <b>sales</b> <b>taxes</b> under revenue neutrality: the retail <b>sales</b> <b>tax,</b> the value added <b>tax,</b> <b>a</b> cascading <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> and <b>a</b> manufacturers' <b>sales</b> <b>tax.</b> The retail <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> is shown to be equivalent to a value added tax. In order to produce equal revenues these two taxes must be {{at a higher rate}} than a cascading tax. However, output under <b>a</b> retail <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> exceeds that under <b>a</b> cascading <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> and deadweight losses are lower.

5|$|In 1995, {{the direct}} carpool lane ramps between I-5 and SR55 were completed; {{these were the}} first in Orange County. The year also saw further {{widening}} of SR55 between SR22 and McFadden Avenue. Between 1996 and 2002, the fifth lane in both directions was constructed between I-5 and SR91, funded with <b>a</b> <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> of half a cent approved by Measure M. In April 2007, the Orange County Transportation Authority approved funds to study the feasibility of extending the Costa Mesa Freeway south to 17th Street via tunnels or flyover ramps. The segment of SR55 from Finley Street to the Newport Channel bridge was legally authorized to {{be turned over to}} the city of Newport Beach in 2009.|$|E
5|$|One {{avenue for}} {{non-compliance}} {{is the black}} market. FairTax supporters state that the black market is largely untaxed under the current tax system. Economists estimate the underground economy in the United States to be between one and three trillion dollars annually. By imposing <b>a</b> <b>sales</b> <b>tax,</b> supporters argue that black market activity would be taxed when proceeds from such activity are spent on legal consumption. For example, the sale of illegal narcotics would remain untaxed (instead of being guilty of income tax evasion, drug dealers would be guilty of failing to submit sales tax), but they would face taxation when they used drug proceeds to buy consumer goods such as food, clothing, and cars. By taxing this previously untaxed money, FairTax supporters argue that non-filers would be paying part of their share of what would otherwise be uncollected income and payroll taxes.|$|E
5|$|Sampson's {{agenda for}} the 1930 session {{was lost in the}} fights over Ben Johnson and Cumberland Falls. His calls for funding the free {{textbook}} program, compulsory sterilization of the mentally ill, and restrictions on chain stores were ignored. Instead, the legislature continued eroding his gubernatorial powers, including the power to appoint members of the textbook commission. With nearly all of the governor's powers stripped away and given to a three-person commission, Lieutenant Governor James Breathitt, Jr. became the de facto governor for the remainder of Sampson's term. The General Assembly pursued its own agenda, passing a mandatory driver's license law, a revised election law, and <b>a</b> <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> on retail stores. They also allocated funding for the purchase of what would become Mammoth Cave National Park. Sampson vetoed 12 bills during the 1930 session, but the legislature overrode 11 of them.|$|E

After the September 11 attacks, the fire department and its then chief, Rick Lasky, attracted national attention when they raised {{a large amount of}} donations for victims' families. As a reward, John Travolta, Joaquin Phoenix, and Robert Patrick visited the department in 2004 to promote the release of the film Ladder 49. In May 2011, Lewisville residents approved <b>a</b> <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> increase to create two public safety districts.

25|$|Since governments also resolve {{commercial}} disputes, {{especially in}} countries with common law, similar arguments are sometimes used to justify <b>a</b> <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> or value added tax. Some (libertarians, for example) portray most or all forms of taxes as immoral due to their involuntary (and therefore eventually coercive/violent) nature. The most extreme anti-tax view, anarcho-capitalism, holds that all social services should be voluntarily bought by the person(s) using them.|$|E
