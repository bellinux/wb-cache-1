5|$|Our quarrel is {{not with}} these men, but with those who give them their chance. We {{who believe in the}} study of nature feel that a real {{knowledge}} and appreciation of wild things, of trees, flowers, birds, and of the grim and crafty creatures of the wilderness, give an added beauty and health to life. Therefore we abhor deliberate or reckless untruth in this study as much <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> other; and therefore we feel that a grave wrong is committed by all who, holding a position that entitles them to respect, yet condone and encourage such untruth.|$|E

25|$|Although {{specialised}} {{techniques and}} tools {{have been developed}} to address the challenges of working under water, the archaeological goals and process are essentially the same <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> other context. Investigating an underwater site however, is likely to take longer and be more costly than an equivalent terrestrial one.|$|E
25|$|A {{basis for}} such a vector space of {{dimensional}} symbols is called a set of base quantities, and all other vectors are called derived units. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> vector space, one may choose different bases, which yields different systems of units (e.g., choosing whether the unit for charge {{is derived from the}} unit for current, or vice versa).|$|E

25|$|The modern view {{of black}} hole {{irreversibility}} is to relate {{it to the}} second law of thermodynamics, since black holes are viewed as thermodynamic objects. Indeed, according to the Gauge–gravity duality conjecture, all microscopic processes in a black hole are reversible, and only the collective behavior is irreversible, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> other macroscopic, thermal system.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> {{strictly}} convex solid, {{at least}} three faces meet at every vertex, and the total of their angles is less than 360 degrees. Since a regular polygon has angles at least 60 degrees, it follows that at most five faces meet at any vertex. The pentagonal pyramid (J2) is an example that actually has a degree-5 vertex.|$|E
25|$|Uranium ISL {{uses the}} native {{groundwater}} in the orebody which is fortified with a complexing agent {{and in most}} cases an oxidant. It is then pumped through the underground orebody to recover the minerals in it by leaching. Once the pregnant solution is returned to the surface, the uranium is recovered {{in much the same way}} <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> other uranium plant (mill).|$|E

Many facilities like lodging, restaurants, cafes, coffee shop, book stalls, waiting halls, cloak rooms, Cyber cafe tourism agents counters, train inquiry counters, train status display (digital) boards, train status announcements, foot bridges etc. are provided to the passengers using the station.|$|E
25|$|To canonically {{quantize}} Chern–Simons theory one {{defines a}} state on each 2-dimensional surface Σ in M. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> quantum field theory, the states correspond to rays in a Hilbert space. There is no preferred notion {{of time in}} a Schwarz-type topological field theory and so one can require that Σ be a Cauchy surface, in fact, a state can be defined on any surface.|$|E

25|$|In {{portable}} photography equipment, single-axis gimbal {{heads are}} used {{in order to allow}} a balanced movement for camera and lenses. This proves useful in wildlife photography as well <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> other case where very long and heavy telephoto lenses are adopted: a gimbal head rotates a lens around its center of gravity, thus allowing for easy and smooth manipulation while tracking moving subjects.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> {{infrastructure}} asset, railways {{must keep}} up with periodic inspection and maintenance {{in order to minimize}} effect of infrastructure failures that can disrupt freight revenue operations and passenger services. Because passengers are considered the most crucial cargo and usually operate at higher speeds, steeper grades, and higher capacity/frequency, their lines are especially important. Inspection practices include track geometry cars or walking inspection. Curve maintenance especially for transit services includes gauging, fastener tightening, and rail replacement.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> {{longitudinal}} study, it {{is possible}} that the characteristics and behaviors of the sample are a partial result of the era they lived in. Indeed, many members of the sample could not attend college, due to the Great Depression and World War II. Almost half of women in the sample were homemakers for most of their lives. Despite these shortcomings, the data from the sample is often used for studies because there is no other group of people who have been followed for so long.|$|E

50|$|If the coda {{consists}} of a consonant cluster, the sonority decreases from left to right, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> the English word help. This is called the sonority profile. English onset and coda clusters are therefore different. The onset str in strengths does not appear <b>as</b> a coda <b>in</b> <b>any</b> English word, and likewise the coda ngths does not appear <b>as</b> an onset <b>in</b> <b>any</b> word.|$|R

25|$|Given {{the proper}} {{environment}} and care, a Komondor is a responsible, loving dog. They are devoted and calm without being sluggish. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> breed, there {{is quite a}} range of personalities, so your needs should be outlined clearly to your breeder. An experienced breeder can try to identify that personality which would be happier as an independent livestock dog, or that which wants more to please and would make a good obedience dog or family pet. Adolescence can be marked by changes in a Komondor's temperament, eating habits, trainability and general attitude.|$|E
25|$|Cost Management: <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> {{other fields}} of engineering, an {{application}} with good structural software quality costs less {{to maintain and}} is easier to understand and change in response to pressing business needs. Industry data demonstrate that poor application structural quality in core business applications (such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM) or large transaction processing systems in financial services) results in cost and schedule overruns and creates waste {{in the form of}} rework (up to 45% of development time in some organizations). Moreover, poor structural quality is strongly correlated with high-impact business disruptions due to corrupted data, application outages, security breaches, and performance problems.|$|E
25|$|In case a Jew practised usury, the {{community}} was not held responsible. The penalty for lending money on the wages of slaves hired out by their masters was loss of the capital. Jews could buy and hold houses, vineyards, and other property in Majorca as well <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> {{other part of the}} kingdom. They could not be compelled to lodge Christians in their homes: in fact, Christians were forbidden to dwell with Jews; and Jewish convicts were given separate cells in the prisons. If the slave of a Jew or Moor adopted Judaism or Mohammedanism, he had to be set free and was required to leave the island.|$|E
