Fade slope indicates the rate of change of rain attenuation. The knowledge of fade slope of <b>attenuation</b> caused <b>by</b> <b>rain</b> or other meteorological events are very important for fade mitigation techniques.

40|$|The major {{drawback}} of Ka band, {{operating frequency}} of the AltiKa altimeter on board SARAL, is its sensitivity to atmospheric liquid water. Even light rain or heavy clouds can strongly attenuate the signal and distort the signal leading to erroneous geophysical parameters estimates.

40|$|Since October 2015, NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) have collaboratively {{operated}} an RF {{terrestrial link}} in Albuquerque, New Mexico to characterize atmospheric propagation phenomena at 72 and 84 GHz. The W/V-band Terrestrial Link Experiment (WTLE) consists of coherent transmitters at each frequency {{on the crest}} of the Sandia Mountains and a corresponding pair of receivers in south Albuquerque. The beacon receivers provide a direct measurement of the link attenuation, while concurrent weather instrumentation provides a measurement of the atmospheric conditions. Among the available weather instruments is an optical disdrometer which yields an optical measurement of rain rate, as well as droplet size and velocity distributions (DSD, DVD). In particular, the DSD can be used to derive an instantaneous scaling factor (ISF) by which the measured data at one frequency can be scaled to another - for example, scaling the 72 GHz to an expected 84 GHz timeseries. Given the availability of both the DSD prediction and the directly observed 84 GHz attenuation, WTLE is thus uniquely able assess DSD-derived instantaneous frequency scaling at the V/W-bands. Previous work along these lines has investigated the DSD-derived ISF at Ka and Q-band (20 GHz to 40 GHz) using a satellite beacon receiver experiment in Milan, Italy. This work will expand the investigation to terrestrial links in the V/W-bands, where the frequency scaling factor is lower and where the link is also much more sensitive to <b>attenuation</b> <b>by</b> <b>rain,</b> clouds, and other atmospheric effects...|$|E

Algorithms to retrieve rainfall over land from TSX measurements that were developed are presented, and the inferred rainfall distribution is compared to rainfall around Hurricane Gustav observed by NOAA operational radars. The impact of antenna beam spreading on satellite-borne sensor measurements of coastal rainfall is also illustrated. Coastal rainfall measured by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) over the Brazilian coast both over land and sea is also compared to rainfall observed by TSX. Because the sea surface cross section varies with wind speed and the wind direction with respect to the sub-satellite track, a surface reference derived from clear regions was considered (as in the case of the TRMM surface reference method). Wind roughened seas have relatively large cross sections so that <b>attenuation</b> <b>by</b> <b>rain</b> of radiation reflected from the sea surface is the dominant mechanism that affects the observed radar cross section.

Whether these systems are slant-path links, terrestrial fixed links, or deep-space links, the high bandwidths available and the relatively low spectral congestion are very attractive. One of the main disadvantages of these frequency bands is that the <b>attenuation</b> caused <b>by</b> meteorological effects can become significant, and the <b>attenuation</b> caused <b>by</b> clouds, <b>rain,</b> and atmospheric gases becomes very large.

Based on this data set, a comparative study of several rainfall estimators that use X-band polarimetric radar data is presented. In tropical convective systems as encountered in Benin, microwave <b>attenuation</b> <b>by</b> <b>rain</b> is significant and quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) at X-band is a challenge. Here, several algorithms based on the combined use of reflectivity, differential reflectivity and differential phase shift are evaluated against rain gauges and disdrometers. Four rainfall estimators were tested on twelve rainy events: the use of attenuation corrected reflectivity only (estimator R(Z(H))), {{the use of the}} specific phase shift only R(K-DP), the combination of specific phase shift and differential reflectivity R(K-DP,Z(DR)) and an estimator that uses three radar parameters R(Z(H), Z(DR),K-DP). The coefficients of the power law relationships between rain rate and radar variables were adjusted either based on disdrometer data and simulation, or on radar-gauges observations. The three polarimetric based algorithms with coefficients predetermined on observations outperform the R(Z(H)) estimator for rain rates above 10 mm/h which explain most of the rainfall in the studied region. For the highest rain rates (above 30 mm/h) R(K-DP) shows even better scores, and given its performances and its simplicity of implementation, is recommended. The radar based retrieval of two parameters of the rain drop size distribution, the normalized intercept parameter N-w and the volumetric median diameter D-m was evaluated on four rainy days thanks to disdrometers. The frequency distributions of the two parameters retrieved by the radar are very close to those observed with the disdrometer. N-w retrieval based on a combination of Z(H) -K-DP-Z(DR) works well whatever the a priori assumption made on the drop shapes. D-m retrieval based on Z(DR) alone performs well, but if satisfactory Z(DR) measurements are not available, the combination Z(H) -K-DP provides satisfactory results for both D-m and N-w if an appropriate a priori assumption on drop shape is made...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that rain leaves {{footprints}} on the sea surface that sometimes become visible on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Rain cells can easily be detected on SAR images at all radar frequencies when they are associated with a downdraft pattern. But rain cells are not always associated with downdraft and rain can also occur in other forms, as stratified rain, rain bands, and squall lines. It turns out that radar signatures of rain at C-band are much more complex than at L- or X-band radar and that it is particularly difficult to identify unambiguously rain events on C-band SAR images acquired over the ocean. This is because C-band lies in the transition region where raindrops impinging onto the sea surface can increase (usually) or decrease the backscattered radar power and where volume scattering and <b>attenuation</b> <b>by</b> <b>rain</b> drops in the atmosphere are not always negligible (at very high rain rates). In order to get an insight into the physical mechanisms causing the C-band radar signatures of rain, we first revisit results obtained from historic laboratory and field experiments and multi-frequency/multi-polarization SAR data acquired during the SIR-C/X-SAR spaceshuttle mission in 1994. Then we analyze several C-band SAR images acquired by the European satellites Envisat and Sentinel- 1 A, and the Canadian satellite Radarsat- 2 and compare them, whenever possible, with quasi-coincident and collocated weather radar images. The observational data show that, at low to medium rain rates, the main physical mechanism causing C-band radar signatures of rain is Bragg scattering at ring waves generated by the rain drops impinging onto the sea surface, which increase the radar backscatter. However, areas of increased radar backscatter are often accompanied by adjacent areas of decreased radar backscatter, which is due to attenuation of the Bragg waves by turbulence also generated by the impinging rain drops. Furthermore, we present a full-polarimetric Radarsat- 2 SAR image of a rain cell together with a polarimetric decomposition analysis, which shows that the C-band radar signature of a rain cell is caused by surface scattering. The observation show that radar signatures of rain cells often contain segments, where the co-polarized as well the cross-polarized radar backscatter are strongly enhanced, which indicates non-Bragg scattering contributions to the scattering process. Furthermore, the polarimetric decomposition analysis shows that the C-band radar signature of a rain cell is dominated by surface scattering. Possible mechanisms, like scattering at splash products, are discussed. Whether the normalized radar cross section (NRCS) due to rain is increased or decreased depends on rain rate, wind speed, incidence angle, and history of the rain event. At low to moderate wind speeds (10 m s− 1) and low to high rain rates (but < 50 mm h− 1), the NRCS is usually decreased by up to 3 dB...|$|E
