They watch where other common ravens bury their food <b>and</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> locations of each other's food caches, so they can steal from them. This type of theft occurs so regularly that common ravens will fly extra distances from a food source to find better hiding places for food. They have also been observed pretending to make a cache without actually depositing the food, presumably to confuse onlookers.|$|E

Perhaps the worst, but all too common, location is a Post-It note on the computer monitor. Better locations are a safe deposit box or a locked file approved for information of sensitivity comparable to that protected by the password. Most locks on office file cabinets are far from adequate. Software is available for popular hand-held computers that can store passwords for numerous accounts in encrypted form. Another approach is to encrypt by hand on paper <b>and</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> encryption method and key.

500|$|Gregory Heaney {{from the}} website AllMusic {{positively}} reviewed the video album, writing, [...] " [...] combines the group's considerable vocal talents with their amazing choreography, delivering the total Destiny's Child package as a video greatest-hits compilation". Jacob Rohn from the website Black Entertainment Television (BET) felt that [...] "While each {{later became a}} star in their own right, Destiny's Child as a group was known for their edgy and visually magnetic videos". He further finished his review by writing, [...] "Destiny's Child Video Anthology is a must-have for any DC fan and anyone that misses the time when music videos were at their peak." [...] A writer of ABC News Radio similarly noted that the album was created for [...] "fans who studied all their moves" [...] <b>and</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> choreography. Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly felt the album was the most [...] "indulgent" [...] memory trip to {{the period of the}} late-1990s and early-2000s memory lane. He further described the videos as [...] "gaudy, stupid fun". However, a more mixed review came from The Morton Report writer Chaz Lipp who felt that the album was incomplete and noted that eight other videos from the group's videography were not released. He remarked that the unreleased videos for the songs, most notably the ones from the holiday album 8 Days of Christmas could have been included as bonus selections. Lipp concluded that Destiny's Child Video Anthology [...] "hits its peak with the group's best single, the irresistibly funky 'Bootylicious'".|$|E

SG-1 return to the planet where Malikai lets slip he too remembers what's happening, but O'Neill finds himself back at breakfast before the altar's activation can be stopped. With the help of O'Neill's and Teal'c's explanations, Carter devises a plan to break the time loop by preventing an incoming wormhole, which fails. Meanwhile, Daniel attempts to translate the altar's writing loop after loop, but his memory is reset each time along with everyone else's, and he cannot possibly translate it all within just a few hours. [...] Ultimately, O'Neill and Teal'c realize the only solution is to learn <b>and</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> alien language themselves. After many loops of teaching, Daniel makes an offhand remark about events that occur during each loop having no consequences once the loop is over, which inspires O'Neill and Teal'c to indulge in wildly outrageous behavior {{as a means of}} dealing with the boredom and frustration of being caught in repeating time. The pair play golf through the active Stargate (much to General Hammond's irritation in at least one loop), Teal'c takes action against the painful starts of his loops by slamming the door back {{in the face of the}} airman who accidentally hit him with it in the beginning of each loop, O'Neill tries pottery-making (clearly improving with each progressive loop), bicycles through the base, and just before the end of one loop, resigns from the Air Force whilst wearing an outrageous sweatshirt for the sole purpose of grabbing Carter and kissing her in the seconds before the loop resets.|$|E

By law, it is required that the Canadian flag on the Peace Tower of Parliament Hill in Ottawa be lowered to half-mast.
