25|$|Development on the {{original}} Dreamcast version of the game began in 1999, under the code name of Project Ares. The game's title was then changed to Eternal Arcadia in 2000, which was the game's final name it was released under in Japan. The internal Sega development team, Overworks, consisted of development staff from Team Andromeda and from the Phantasy Star development teams. The game's producer, Rieko Kodama, in addition to working on Phantasy Star 1, 2, and 4, had also worked {{on the first two}} Sonic the Hedgehog games for the Sega Genesis, while scenario writer Shuntaro Tanaka had written the stories for the first two Sakura Wars game, highly popular Japan-only RPG releases. The game's soundtrack was composed by Yutaka Minobe and Tatsuyuki Maeda, the latter of which had composed music for Sonic 3 & Knuckles. Anticipation and expectations were immediately set high, between the team's pedigree, especially considering that Team Andromeda's prior game, Panzer Dragoon Saga, had received critical acclaim, and the relative lack of high quality JRPG's on the Dreamcast. Despite the pressure placed on the team, development generally went smoothly, something attributed to the increased horsepower and easier to develop for nature of the Dreamcast, in comparison to the Saturn. The team was made up of a staff of around 20 people. The team made conscious decisions to make entering individual buildings in towns seamless, without <b>additional</b> <b>loading,</b> and to use an expressive, anime art style to more clearly show facial expressions and emotions of characters, both of which they felt had been lacking from recent popular RPGs such as Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII. Similarly, while the aforementioned games were focused on dark themes and complicated gameplay systems, Overworks strove to keep the game bright and cheerful, with simple gameplay mechanics that focused on exploring a large game world. The game had to be released across two of Sega's proprietary GD-Rom discs, to accommodate its relatively large size.|$|E

30|$|<b>Additional</b> <b>load</b> visibly changed {{temporal}} {{as well as}} spatial {{characteristics of}} the gait. With <b>additional</b> <b>load,</b> the rats walked more slowly with larger stride width and reduced step size compared to without <b>additional</b> <b>load</b> (Fig. 5). Furthermore, with <b>additional</b> <b>load</b> the rat walked with a concave back.|$|R
30|$|The results {{similarly}} {{showed that}} <b>additional</b> <b>load</b> significantly increased stance time of FL and HL, which indicates concurrent walking velocity decreased. Furthermore, <b>additional</b> <b>load</b> affected {{the relation of}} peak force to stance time, {{which suggests that the}} different rats may have used different strategies to cope with the load, resulting in a less predictable peak force and rate of force rise in relation to stance time. The relations of peak force to stance time also revealed that high peak force (comparable to that when walking with <b>additional</b> <b>load)</b> and high rate of force rise (comparable to that when walking without <b>additional</b> <b>load)</b> in FL can be obtained by increasing the walking velocity with a motor driven treadmill.|$|R
30|$|This study {{aimed to}} test the effects of <b>additional</b> <b>load</b> and slope on ground {{reaction}} forces in rat FL and HL. In summary, in female adult Wistar rats, the FL bones showed the highest Fmax when the rat walked downward, while the HL bones showed the highest Fmax when the rat walked upward. <b>Additional</b> <b>load</b> increased peak force in the FLs but decreased peak force in the HLs. Moreover, <b>additional</b> <b>load</b> increased stance time. Overall, this suggests that upward walking without load generates a response in the HL, while downward walking generates a response in the FL. The <b>additional</b> <b>load</b> likely leads {{to changes in the}} FL bones when walking downward, though bone changes in the HL may remain undetectable.|$|R

2500|$|The {{next step}} was in Europe was after the Second World War. [...] Vessels {{purpose-built}} to carry containers were used between UK and Netherlands [...] and also in Denmark in 1951.

30|$|We {{aimed to}} {{study the effects of}} <b>additional</b> <b>load</b> on ground {{reaction}} forces of rat fore limbs (FL) and hind limbs (HL). Since <b>additional</b> <b>load</b> results in an osteogenic response, we assumed <b>additional</b> <b>load</b> will increase the ground reaction force. Secondly, we aimed {{to study the}} effects of different slopes on ground reaction forces of rat FLs as well as HLs. Since downhill walking or running costs less energy in both rats (Armstrong et al. 1983) and humans (Margaria et al. 1963), it may be a more feasible exercise regimen in both rats and humans.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} how an <b>additional</b> <b>load</b> influences the force-vs-time relationship of the countermovement vertical jump (CMVJ). The participants that took part in the experiment were 18 male university students who played sport recreationally, including regular games of volleyball. They were asked to perform a CMVJ without involving the arms under four conditions: without and with <b>additional</b> <b>loads</b> of 10 %, 20 %, and 30 % of their body weight (BW). The vertical component of the ground reaction force (GRF) was measured by a force plate. The GRF was used to calculate the durations of the preparatory, braking, and acceleration phases, the total duration of the jump, force impulses during the braking and acceleration phases, average forces during the braking and acceleration phases, and the maximum force of impact at landing. Results were evaluated using repeated-measures ANOVA. Increasing the <b>additional</b> <b>load</b> prolonged both the braking and acceleration phases of the jump, with statistically significant changes in the duration of the acceleration phase found for an <b>additional</b> <b>load</b> of 20 % BW. The magnitude of the force systematically and significantly increased with the <b>additional</b> <b>load.</b> The force impulse during the acceleration phase did not differ significantly between jumps performed with loads of 20 % and 30 % BW. The results suggest that the optimal <b>additional</b> <b>load</b> for developing explosive strength in vertical jumping ranges from 20 % to 30 % of BW, with this value varying between individual subjects.

40|$|The {{proposed}} {{procedure is}} {{based on the fact that}} total transformer losses (PLL 1,n), determined by short circuit test, can be separated into two components: the eddy current losses in the windings (PEC 1,n) and stray flux losses (PSL 1,n) in iron parts of construction as well as in the transformer tank walls. The total <b>additional</b> <b>load</b> losses, PLLd 1 and PLLdh, are determined by short circuit test results, conducted at rated frequency (f 1) and at increased harmonic frequency (fh=h*f 1). Using so obtained total <b>additional</b> <b>load</b> losses, PLLd 1 and PLLdh, which can be expressed in the form PLLdh=PEC 1,n*h 2 + PSL 1,n*h, the corresponding rate <b>additional</b> <b>load</b> losses values PEC 1,n and PSL 1,n are derived. At the end, for given load with predefined high harmonics content, (Ih/I 1 n), relative to rated current, the total <b>additional</b> <b>load</b> losses value ΣPLLdh > PLLd 1, is found.
