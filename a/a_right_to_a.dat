The dispute began when Boycott and Carr supported different sets of candidates in elections for the Board of Guardians to the Church Mission Estate, and Boycott's candidates won. Carr was also the local receiver of wrecks, which meant that he was entitled to collect the salvage from all shipwrecks in the area, and guard it until it was sold in a public auction. The local receiver had <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> percentage of the sale and to keep whatever did not sell. In 1860 Carr {{wrote a letter to the}} Official Receiver of Wrecks stating that Boycott and his men had illegally broken up a wreck and moved the salvage to Boycott's property. In response to this accusation, Boycott sued Carr for libel and claimed £500 in damages.|$|E

A senior prosecutor on the case, Michael Crimp, also expressed his concerns about potentially prejudicial media coverage: [...] "Steven Wright stands accused of these offences and has <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fair trial before a jury.

500|$|The High Court also {{examined}} {{a number of}} related propositions. In particular, they pointed out that when interpreting the legislation which established legal aid services, Australian courts did not recognise an absolute right to counsel in all circumstances, and thus the State {{does not need to}} provide counsel {{for the duration of the}} trial. The court also raised the question of what a right to counsel would actually mean in practice: that is, would a right to counsel at public expense entitle a person to counsel of a certain degree of experience? Furthermore, the court suggested that having a right to representation would necessarily imply that a trial conducted without the accused being legally represented would necessarily be unfair, an idea which has been rejected by the Australian courts. The accused must have lost a [...] "real chance of acquittal" [...] before a trial can be regarded as unfair. Essentially, Australian common law recognised <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fair trial, but the question of whether the lack of representation caused an unfair trial had to be based on the particular circumstances of each case.|$|E

500|$|The Supreme Court's 1982 Plyler v. Doe decision—in a case {{involving}} illegal alien children (i.e., children born abroad {{who had come to}} the United States illegally along with their parents, and who had no basis for claiming U.S. citizenship)—has also been cited in support of a broad application of Fourteenth Amendment jurisdiction to illegal aliens and their children. [...] A Texas state law had sought to deny such children a public education, and the Texas government had argued that [...] "persons who have entered the United States illegally are not 'within the jurisdiction' of a State even if they are present within a State's boundaries and subject to its laws." [...] A 5–4 majority of the Supreme Court, though, decided that according to Wong Kim Ark, the Fourteenth Amendment's phrases subject to the jurisdiction thereof (in the Citizenship Clause) and within its jurisdiction (in the Equal Protection Clause) were essentially equivalent; that both expressions referred primarily to physical presence and not to political allegiance; [...] and that the Wong Kim Ark decision benefited the children of illegal as well as legal aliens. [...] As a result, the court rejected the claim that Fourteenth Amendment [...] "jurisdiction" [...] depended on whether someone had entered the U.S. legally or not. [...] Although the four dissenting justices disagreed with the opinion of the Court regarding whether the children in question had <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> public education, the dissenters agreed with the majority regarding the applicability of Fourteenth Amendment jurisdiction to illegal aliens. [...] James Ho considers Plyer v.
