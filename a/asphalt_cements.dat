40|$|AbstractThis study aims to {{evaluate}} and characterize the properties of modified <b>asphalt</b> <b>cements</b> exposed to high temperature. The Acrylate Styrene Acrylonhrtilrei (ASA) polymer and nano aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3) nanoparticles {{were added to the}} base asphalt cement with concentrations of 3, 5 and 7 % of the weight of asphalt. The storage stability, viscosity, frequency sweep and MSRC test were considered for evaluation. The results demonstrate that the addition of ASA polymer and Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles content have a great influence on the rheological properties of the asphalt cement at high temperatures. Additionally, {{it is clear that the}} storage stability of modified <b>asphalt</b> <b>cements</b> with ASA polymer and Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles has good compatibility among the asphalt cement and the modifiers. Moreover, the complex modulus (G*) improves as the concentration of both modifiers increases. The improvement was 63. 70 % for 5 % ASA polymer, and 71. 12 % for 5 % Al 2 O 3 at 75 °C. Moreover, the modified <b>asphalt</b> <b>cements</b> demonstrates great resistance to high temperatures rutting, as the enhancement was up to 80 and 59 % for 5 % concentration of ASA and Al 2 O 3. The modification of <b>asphalt</b> <b>cements</b> provides increasing the creep recovery up to 69. 23 and 62. 53 %.

In such situations, <b>asphalt</b> <b>cement</b> shows so different rheological-mechanical behavior. If <b>asphalt</b> <b>cement</b> isn’t compatible enough, asphalt layer will be damaged immediately and expensive repairing procedures should be performed then.

This research was aimed at determining the effects of additives on the aging of <b>asphalt</b> <b>cements</b> and rejuvenated <b>asphalt</b> <b>cements.</b> This was accomplished by performing two experiments. The first experiment was {{to determine the effects of}} various amounts of quick lime (CaO) and hydrated lime (Ca(OH),) on SHRP AAA-I and SHRP AAF- 1. The second experiment was to determine the effects of three different amines and various amounts of CaO on aged SHRP AAA-I and SHRP AAF-I rejuvenated with ABM-F 2, YBF-F 2, and AAF-F 3. The experiments were designed and performed to study the oxidation rates, the hardening rates, the hardening susceptibilities, and if possible, the prediction of the critical times for pavement failure due to the hardening of the <b>asphalt</b> <b>cements.</b> The results from the first experiment showed that Ca(OH), was a better lime additive than CaO. CaO accelerated the oxidation rates although it improved the hardening susceptibilities. Ca(OH) 2 improved the hardening susceptibilities as well but also slowed the oxidation rates. 4 -(3 -Phenylpropyl) -Pyridine and N-Phenyl- 1 -Naphthylamine from the second experiment increased the oxidation rates, dropped the initial viscosities, and decreased the critical times while the 2 -Aminophenol improved the oxidation rates, had only a slight drop in initial viscosities, and greatly increased the critical times. Except for the health hazards, the 2 -Aminophenol would be considered a good additive if it were determined to be cost effective.

40|$|This is a {{continuation}} of a project initiated a year ago to determine any differences in test results on recovered <b>asphalt</b> <b>cements</b> caused by the use of industrial grade of solvent as compared with the reagent grade. AASHTO specifies the use of reagent grade of trichlorethylene, but the Laboratory uses industrial grade which costs much less. Last year this objective of the project was aborted when it was found that a larger difference in test results was obtained between the two distillation apparatuses than between the two solvents, Then all efforts were directed toward obtaining uniformity in test results between the apparatuses under the east hood as compared with that under the west hood. Considerable progress was made toward this end. (See report under this same title dated April 1982). The objective this year was to again evaluate the results when using both variables (apparatuses and solvents).

For this reason the Iowa Highway Research Board has sponsored a number of research programs {{for the purpose of}} developing new and effective methods for making use of whatever materials are locally available. This need is ever more pressing today due to the decreasing availability of road funds and quality materials, and the increasing costs of energy and all types of binder materials. In the 1950 s, Professor L. H.

In this process controlled foam was produced by introducing saturated steam at about 40 psi into heated asphalt cement at about 25 psi through a specially designed and properly adjusted nozzle. The reduced viscosity and the increased volume and surface energy in the foamed asphalt allowed intimate coating and mixing of cold, wet aggregates or soils. Through the use of <b>asphalt</b> <b>cements</b> in a foamed state, materials normally considered unsuitable could be used in the preparation of mixes for stabilized bases and surfaces for low traffic road construction.

The presence of recycled and waste fibers in mixtures offer the potential of durable, longer lasting roads. This paper summarizes the findings of two independent studies. One investigation studied four fiber types in an asphalt concrete with a polymer modified <b>asphalt</b> <b>cement</b> to measure the effectiveness of commercial and recycled/waste fibers. All four fibers; commercial cellulose and polyester and waste nylon and ground carpet, were added to an asphalt concrete mixture at the same proportions.

Stripping resistance tests, Resilient Modulus and indirect tensile stress tests were conducted according to the Asphalt-Aggregate Mixture Analysis System (AAMAS) to measure performance of the fiber mixtures. A comparison study was conducted on mixtures compacted to densities simulating the densities achieved at construction. Indirect Tensile Strengths and Resilient Modulus were measured. Evaluation of overall performances of the different fiber types suggests all fibers can be used in asphalt concrete mixtures.
