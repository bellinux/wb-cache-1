50|$|For a given crevice type, {{two factors}} are {{important}} in the initiation of crevice corrosion: the chemical composition of the electrolyte in the crevice and the potential drop into the crevice. Researchers had previously claimed that either {{one or the other}} of the two factors was responsible for initiating crevice corrosion, but recently it has been shown that it is a combination of the two that causes active crevice corrosion. Both the potential drop and the change in composition of the crevice electrolyte are caused by deoxygenation of the crevice and a separation of electroactive areas, with net anodic reactions occurring within the crevice and net cathodic reactions occurring exterior to the crevice (on the bold surface). The ratio of the surface areas between the cathodic and <b>anodic</b> <b>region</b> is significant.|$|E

The metal and the crevice former surface roughness, the presence of particulates under the crevice former and the accumulation of solid corrosion products at the corroding site would significantly affect the current and potential distribution at the anode by increasing the ohmic potential drop. Most crevice corrosion models focus on a smooth walled crevice of uniform gap and do {{not account for the}} changing profile after crevice corrosion has been initiated. In this work we analyze the crevice (<b>anodic)</b> <b>region</b> and apply current and potential distribution models {{to examine the effects of}} the perturbed surface topography.

This work focuses {{on the evolution of}} corrosion damage of Ni-Cr-Mo alloys in hot brines.

Also if the starting potential was more anodic, the cathodic and <b>anodic</b> active <b>regions</b> extended much more into both cathodic and <b>anodic</b> <b>regions.</b> While scans 2 and 3 gave nearly the same current, scan 1 always gave higher cathodic current especially in the presence of counter-ions.

40|$|Author abstract]The sharp {{increase}} of the differential capacity {{took place at the}} corona point of U-E curves. U-values gave the following anionic sequence:F^- > Cl^- > Br^- > I^-Over the <b>anodic</b> <b>region,</b> the I^- ion, of the smaller electronegativity, is more strongly adsorbed on the mercury surface, and hence gives a larger q-value, than the F^- ion, of the stronger electronegativity. However, since the interfacial leakage is larger for the former, the U-value is smaller than the latter. Although the U-voltage over the cathodic region, due to the adsorption of hydrated alkali ion on the mercury surface, would appear to have the same value as above, the same sequence is found as the <b>anodic</b> <b>region,</b> if we take into account Grahame's q-E curve, i. e. the leakage between halide ions from the diffuse double layer and the induced positive ions. Although the U-E curve naturally has not the hump characteristic of C-E and dq/dE-E curves, the dU/dE curve has a peak near the ecm. The dq/dE-E curve is in good agreement with the differential capacity curve obtained by us. The dU/dT-E curve has a maximum near the ecm, but shows a somewhat different tendency from the differential capacity and dq/dE-E curves. These behaviours of U-effect were concluded to be due to the leakage at the interfacial electrical double layer, which occurs by the application of polarising potential.

40|$|AbstractSeveral {{experimental}} {{measurements are}} expressed {{in the form of}} one-dimensional profiles, for which there is a scarcity of methodologies able to classify the pertinence of a given result to a specific group. The polarization curves that evaluate the corrosion kinetics of electrodes in corrosive media are applications where the behavior is chiefly analyzed from profiles. Polarization curves are indeed a classic method to determine the global kinetics of metallic electrodes, but the strong nonlinearity from different metals and alloys can overlap and the discrimination becomes a challenging problem. Moreover, even finding a typical curve from replicated tests requires subjective judgment. In this paper, we used the so-called multi-q approach based on the Tsallis statistics in a classification engine to separate the multiple polarization curve profiles of two stainless steels. We collected 48 experimental polarization curves in an aqueous chloride medium of two stainless steel types, with different resistance against localized corrosion. Multi-q pattern analysis was then carried out on a wide potential range, from cathodic up to <b>anodic</b> <b>regions.</b> An excellent classification rate was obtained, at a success rate of 90 %, 80 %, and 83 % for low (cathodic), high (anodic), and both potential ranges, respectively, using only 2 % of the original profile data.

Hybrid silane pre-treatments with nano-additives and corrosion inhibitors as fillers for corrosion protection of low carbon steels using sol-gel processing technique were developed. Multifunctional silane molecules used to design the hybrid silane films were based on cross-condensation between an epoxy-silane, 3 -glycidoxy-propyl-trimethoxy-silane (GPTMS) and methyl-triethoxy-silane (MTES) in acid catalysis condition. The silane films thus developed on low carbon steel surface also showed good adhesion, verified by Fourier Transform Infra-red Spectroscopy (FTIR). The corrosion resistance of the silane films modified with impregnation of corrosion inhibitors (i. e. rare earth salts) and/or silica nanoparticles was evaluated by electrochemical measurements using potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The corrosion studies were complimented by investigation of surface topography and wetting properties using scanning electron microscopy coupled with {{energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy}} (SEM-EDX) and contact angle measurements, respectively. This work aided the identification of the synergistic effects of both additives in efficient retardation of corrosion kinetics of the low carbon steel. The direct addition of active lanthanum triflate species, was found to have detrimental effects effect on corrosion resistance of the steel. The investigation also included cerium and yttrium triflates, for activation of silica nanoparticles within hybrid silane network for corrosion protection of low carbon steel. The electrochemical investigations elucidate the superior corrosion resistance of cerium activated systems on low carbon steel, as compared to lanthanum and yttrium triflates. It is proposed that the cerium triflates within the silane films on coated steels, forms cerium oxides or hydroxides on cathodic and <b>anodic</b> <b>regions</b> as a result of increase in pH during corrosion, thus hindering further progression of the corrosion onset.

Also, Cu UPD was hindered by both O 2 and H 2 plasma modified Ru surfaces because the binding strength between Cu and Ru was weakened by O 2 and H 2 plasma treatment.
