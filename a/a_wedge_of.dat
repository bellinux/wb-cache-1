5|$|As the {{incipient}} ocean widened in the Late Proterozoic and Early Paleozoic, {{it broke}} the continental crust {{in two and}} a true ocean basin developed to the west. All the earlier formations were thus dissected along a steep front on {{the two halves of}} the previous continent. <b>A</b> <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> clastic sediment then started to accumulate {{at the base of the}} two underwater precipices, starting the formation of opposing continental shelves.|$|E

5000|$|In geometry, <b>a</b> spherical <b>wedge</b> or ungula is {{a portion}} of a ball bounded by two plane semidisks and a spherical lune (termed the wedge's base).

If AB is a semidisk that forms a ball when completely revolved about the z-axis, revolving AB only through a given α produces <b>a</b> spherical <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> the same angle α.

25|$|As Nahuatl, {{carried by}} the Toltec and later the Aztec culture, became a lingua franca {{throughout}} Mesoamerica even some Mayan states such as the K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj adopted Nahuatl as a prestige language. In Oaxaca Zapotec and Mixtec peoples expanded their territories displacing speakers of the Tequistlatecan languages slightly. During this time the Purépecha (Tarascans) consolidated their state based at Tzintzuntzan. They were resistant to other states of Mesoamerica and had little contact {{with the rest of}} Mesoamerica. Probably {{as a result of their}} isolationist policy the Purépecha language is the only language of Mesoamerica to not show any of the traits associated with the Mesoamerican Linguistic Area. In Guerrero the Tlapanecs of Yopitzinco speaking the Oto-Manguean Tlapanec language remained independent of the Aztec empire as did some of the Oaxacan cultures such as the Mixtecs of Tututepec and the Zapotec of Zaachila. In the late postclassic around 1400 CE Zapotecs of Zaachila moved into the Isthmus of Tehuantepec creating <b>a</b> <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> Zapotec speaking settlements between the former neighbors the Mixe and the Huave who were pushed into their current territories on the edges of the Isthmus.|$|E

500|$|Low-level outflow {{boundaries}} from thunderstorms are {{cooler and}} more moist than the air mass the thunderstorm originally formed within {{due to its}} wet bulbing by rain, forming <b>a</b> <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> denser air which spreads out {{from the base of}} the parent thunderstorm.

500|$|Outflow, in meteorology, is {{air that}} flows {{outwards}} from a storm system. [...] It {{is associated with}} ridging, or anticyclonic flow. [...] In the low levels of the troposphere, outflow radiates from thunderstorms {{in the form of}} <b>a</b> <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> rain-cooled air, which is visible as a thin rope-like cloud on weather satellite imagery or a fine line on weather radar imagery. [...] Low-level outflow boundaries can disrupt the center of small tropical cyclones. [...] However, outflow aloft is essential for the strengthening of a tropical cyclone. [...] If this outflow is undercut, the tropical cyclone weakens. [...] If two tropical cyclones are in proximity, the upper level outflow from the system to the west can limit the development of the system to the east.|$|E

500|$|Wellington {{planned to}} use {{the greater part of}} his army to drive the bulk of Soult's army well to the east, away from Bayonne. Once the French army was pressed {{sufficiently}} far to the east, a strong Allied corps would seize a bridgehead over the Adour River to the west of Bayonne and encircle that fortress. Because Soult's army was weakened by three divisions, Wellington's forces were superior enough to risk dividing them into two bodies. Soult wished to contain his opponent in <b>a</b> <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> occupied French territory. Strongly garrisoned Bayonne blocked {{the north side of the}} Allied-occupied area. East of the city, three French divisions held the line of the Adour to Port-de-Lanne.

500|$|The {{influx of}} warm, moist air over <b>a</b> <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> cold air {{near the surface}} {{resulted}} in a severe ice storm across central and northern New England, most notably in the upper Connecticut River Valley.

In the hardest-hit areas, damage from the ice storm was comparable to that caused by the 1938 New England hurricane. The combined load of snow and ice caused significant damage to many residential and industrial buildings, with several factory and warehouse roofs collapsing. Livestock were killed in multiple rural building collapses throughout the area. Southern Maine endured its second damaging ice storm in a week, {{with many of the}} same communities losing power on both occasion. Precipitation also transitioned to freezing rain and sleet across interior Connecticut, where the dangerous conditions induced numerous traffic accidents. Due to the abnormally cold temperatures {{in the wake of the}} storm, the glaze persisted for up to six weeks, much longer than the typical three days for ice storms in New England.|$|E
500|$|In {{his second}} season, Sayers {{led the league}} in rushing with 1,231 yards, {{averaging}} 5.4 yards per carry with eight touchdowns and becoming the first halfback to win the rushing title since 1949.

He also supplanted his all-purpose yards total from the previous season, gaining 2,440 to set the NFL record. The first of his kickoff return touchdowns that season came against the Los Angeles Rams, as he followed <b>a</b> <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> blockers en route to a 93-yard score. Against the Minnesota Vikings in the Bears' final game of the season, and the first of Sayers' pro career with his parents in attendance, he carried 17 times for a franchise-record 197 yards after returning the opening kickoff 90 yards for a touchdown. Sayers was named to All-Pro first teams by the AP, UPI, the NEA, The Sporting News, and the Pro Football Writers Association, among others. Starring in his second straight Pro Bowl, Sayers carried 11 times for 110 yards and was named the back of the game.
