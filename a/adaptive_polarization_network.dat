The <b>polarization</b> <b>network</b> {{is based on}} a waveguide-implemented fully-reconfigurable optical interleaver using a two-ring resonator-assisted asymmetric Mach-Zehnder structure. For microwave photonic signal processing, this structure is able to serve as a wideband 2 × 2 RF coupler with reconfigurable complex coefficients, and therefore {{can be used as a}} <b>polarization</b> <b>network</b> for wideband antennas. Such a device can equip the antennas with not only the polarization rotation capability for linear-polarization signals but also the capability to operate with and tune between two opposite circular polarizations. Operating together with a particular modulation scheme, the device is also able to serve for simultaneous feeding of dual-polarization signals. These photonic-implemented RF functionalities can be applied to wideband antenna systems to perform agile polarization manipulations and tracking operations. An example of such a interleaver has been realized in TriPleX waveguide technology, which was designed with a free spectral range of 20 GHz and a mask footprint of smaller than 1 × 1 cm. Using the realized device, the reconfigurable complex coefficients of the <b>polarization</b> <b>network</b> were demonstrated with a continuous bandwidth from 2 to 8 GHz and an in-band phase ripple of smaller than 5 degree. The waveguide structure of the device allows it to be further integrated with other functional building blocks of a photonic integrated circuit to realize on-chip, complex microwave photonic processors. Of particular interest, it can be included in an optical beamformer for phased array antennas, so that simultaneous wideband beam and polarization trackings can be achieved photonically.

Starting from the problem of designing the optimal polarizations for the scalar measurement system with joint Tx/Rx polarization optimization, under considering the minimum MSE of the estimator as the figure of merit, a sequential method of selecting the optimal Tx/Rx polarizations for such system is developed by owing to a suitable reformulation of the considered non-convex design problem. Furthermore, by employing a similar deviation procedure, a sequential method to select the optimal transmission polarization for the vector system with transmission polarization optimization is also devised. Since both the proposed algorithms make use of the sequential minimum MSE estimation, they monotonically decrease the MSE of the estimation and converge to a stationary point. The complexity of the proposed methods is linear with the number of outer iterations whereas at each iteration, it mainly requires the lattice search along four and two trigonometric parameters, respectively.|$|R

40|$|Adaptive {{shaping of}} the phase and {{amplitude}} of femtosecond laser pulses {{has been developed}} into an efficient tool for the directed manipulation of interference phenomena, thus providing coherent control over various quantum-mechanical systems. Temporal resolution in the femtosecond or even attosecond range has been demonstrated, but spatial resolution is limited by diffraction to approximately half the wavelength of the light field (that is, several hundred nanometres). Theory has indicated that the spatial limitation to coherent control can be overcome with the illumination of nanostructures: the spatial near-field distribution was shown {{to depend on the}} linear chirp of an irradiating laser pulse. An extension of this idea to adaptive control, combining multiparameter pulse shaping with a learning algorithm, demonstrated the generation of user-specified optical near-field distributions in an optimal and flexible fashion. Shaping of the polarization of the laser pulse provides a particularly efficient and versatile nano-optical manipulation method. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of this concept experimentally, by tailoring the optical near field in the vicinity of silver nanostructures through <b>adaptive</b> <b>polarization</b> shaping of femtosecond laser pulses and then probing the lateral field distribution by two-photon photoemission electron microscopy.

40|$|Living organisms contain {{thousands}} of interacting complex networks of macromolecules, {{and there are}} very few tools to understand them. The present thesis is an attempt to elucidate some aspects of two interacting networks which are responsible for the coordinated chemotactic locomotion of a cell. One of the networks, the directional sensing network, is responsible for the reception of external molecular signals to which the cell is exposed. This network also transforms the external signal into an internal one (`response'), which is amplified and used by the the second <b>network,</b> the <b>polarization</b> <b>network,</b> to tune and to guide the cellular motor which propells the cell using its polymerizing cytoskeleton. A stochastic model, a type of cellular automata model, has been developed and employed in order to address various questions. For example, how an external signal with a weak spatial gradient can be translated by molecules into a strongly amplified and localized response, and how this response regulates the local activity and the spatial distribution of the actin cytoskeleton which controls the velocity and the direction of the cell's movements. By using a stochastic model, which includes explicit particles, the investigations provide a link to known approaches in theoretical physics, as there are, e. g., cooperative phenomena in many-body problems and space-time correlations in nonlinear dynamics. Since the present study is the first attempt employing a stochastic model, as compared to previous kinetic and deterministic models for chemotaxis, the achieved results contain new and important information. It is shown, among others, that the amplification of the response exhibits a transition as function of the gradient of the signal. The spatial localization of the response, represented by the distribution of activated PIP molecules along the cell membrane, depends on the gradient and the maximum of the signal. Using the `Local Exciter and Global Inhibitor' (LEGI) model, proposed recently by other researchers for the directional sensing network, it is shown how the spacial-temporal distributions of the two types of inhibitor and exciter molecules are correlated to the amplification of the response in terms of activated PIP molecules. The major advantage of the present approach, however, is the combination of a particle-based LEGI network with a particle-based <b>polarization</b> <b>network,</b> where the latter includes explicitly linear and branching polymerization of actin filaments. Taking the two regulatory networks, including their signaling molecules and the actin molecules together, a minimal cell model has been developed, where the cell membrane is represented by a two-dimensional flexible ring polymer. During Monte Carlo simulations of this model, the chemotactic motion of the cell could be monitored. The analysis of the trajectories shows that the magnitude of the drift velocity can be tuned by the combination of the signal gradient, the signal maximum and the signal-mediated polymerization of the filaments. This explains the experimentally known high sensitivity of chemotactic cell to weak external signal gradients...|$|R

In [3], the authors propose an <b>adaptive</b> waveform <b>polarization</b> method for the estimation of target scatter {{in the presence of}} clutter. The proposed algorithm, to determine the coefficients of the antenna transmission and reception polarizations, has a convex form and can be solved by employing SDP. However, the authors do not investigate whether the polarization vectors can be obtained after the convex problem is solved to obtain A (at least such processing is absent in the paper). In this appendix, we provide a proof that the transmission and reception polarization vectors cannot be effectively obtained through the solution of A. Essentially, the convex form is only a relaxation version of the initial problem. The proof is as follows.|$|R
30|$|We {{choose the}} {{conventional}} polarimetric radar and the polarimetric radar with <b>adaptive</b> transmission <b>polarization</b> as the counterparts to compare their performances with the polarimetric radar with joint Tx/Rx optimization.

In the reception side, the horizontal and vertical polarizations are simultaneously received, so the reception vector satisfies η =[√(2)/ 2,√(2)/ 2]^T. Therefore, the relevant MSE can be calculated by substituting the waveform parameters α[*]=[*] 0,[*]β[*]=[*] 0,[*]θ[*]=[*]‐[*]π/ 4,[*]ϑ[*]=[*] 0 and α[*]=[*]−[*]π/ 2, β[*]=[*] 0,[*]θ[*]=[*]−[*]π/ 4,[*]ϑ[*]=[*] 0, alternatively, into Algorithm 1 {{with the increase of}} observation samples and without optimal polarization search. Then, as to the scalar system with transmission polarization optimization, the transmission polarization [ξ_h,ξ_v]^T is allowed to be chosen freely while the reception polarization is fixed as [√(2)/ 2,√(2)/ 2]^T. As such, we can employ Algorithm 1 to optimally select transmission polarization by fixing θ[*]=[*]−[*]π/ 4 and ϑ[*]=[*] 0.|$|R
