40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a {{combined}} direct and indirect adaptive control scheme for adjusting an <b>adaptive</b> <b>fuzzy</b> controller, and an <b>adaptive</b> <b>fuzzy</b> identification model parameters. First, using <b>adaptive</b> <b>fuzzy</b> building blocks, with {{a common set of}} parameters, we design and study an adaptive controller and an adaptive identification model that have been proposed for a general class of the uncertain structure nonlinear dynamic systems. We then propose a hybrid adaptive (HA) law for ad-justing the parameters. The HA law utilizes two types of errors in the adaptive system, the tracking error and the modeling error. Performance analysis using a Lyapunov synthesis approach proves the superiority of the HA law over the direct adaptive (DA) method in terms of faster and improved tracking and pa-rameter convergence. Furthermore, this is achieved at a negligible increasing in the implementation cost and the computational complexity. We prove a theorem that shows the properties of this hybrid <b>adaptive</b> <b>fuzzy</b> control system, i. e., bounds for the integral of the squared errors, and the conditions under which these errors converge asymptotically to zero are obtained. Finally, we apply the hybrid <b>adaptive</b> <b>fuzzy</b> controller to control a chaotic system, and the inverted pendulum system. The simulation results demonstrate and confirm the theoretical results.

In this paper, two <b>adaptive</b> <b>fuzzy</b> controllers are designed based on the Lyapunov synthesis approach. We require that the final closed-loop system must be globally staible in the sense that all signals involved (states, controls, pariuneters, etc.) must be uniformly bounded. Roughly speaking, the <b>adaptive</b> <b>fuzzy</b> controllers are designed through the following steps: first, construct an initial controller based on linguistic descriptions (in the form of fuzzy IF-THEN rules) about the unknown plant from human experts; then, develop an adaptation law to adjust the parameters of the fuzzy controller on-line. Wie prove, for both <b>adaptive</b> <b>fuzzy</b> controllers, that: 1) all signals in the closed-loop systems are uniformly bounded; and 2) the tracking errors converge to zero under mild conditions. We proviide the specific formulas of the bounds so that controller designers can determine the bounds based on their requirements. Finally, the <b>adaptive</b> <b>fuzzy</b> controllers are used to control the inverted pendulum to track a given trajectory, and the simulation results show that: 1) the <b>adaptive</b> <b>fuzzy</b> controllers can perform successful tracking without using any linguistic information; and 2) after incorporating some linguistic fuzzy rules into the controllers, the adaptation speed becomes faster and the tracking error becomes smaller...|$|R
