5|$|A shot rang out. It {{was likely}} a warning shot fired by a panicked, {{exhausted}} British soldier from the 43rd, according to Captain Laurie's report to his commander after the fight.

5|$|Hurricane Dean {{emerged into}} the Bay of Campeche as a Category1 {{hurricane}} {{on the afternoon}} of August21. Its inner core was largely disrupted, so although <b>a</b> <b>ragged</b> eye reformed over the warm waters of the bay, the hurricane no longer had the structure to support its previous strength. Nevertheless, the warm waters of the bay proved conducive for some development and the eye contracted overnight, indicating that the hurricane was regaining structure. With better structure came stronger winds of 100mph (160km/h), and the storm was re-categorized as a Category2 hurricane.|$|E

5|$|In early July, shower {{activity}} {{increased in}} association with an area of disturbed weather. With surface pressures lower than normal for a tropical disturbance, deep convection increased further and Tropical Depression Six-E formed late on July 5 and reaching tropical storm status the following day and was named Dolores. Despite moderate wind shear, very cold cloud tops formed as the winds increased to , a moderate tropical storm. Moving westward, Dolores strengthened into the first hurricane of the season on July 7 as <b>a</b> <b>ragged</b> eye formed.|$|E
5|$|Late on 7February, {{while still}} {{tracking}} to the east-southeast, Jasmine rapidly intensified, with wind speeds increasing to 185km/h (115mph), sustained for one minute. The cyclone developed <b>a</b> <b>ragged</b> eye stretching 40km (25mi) across. Later that day, Jasmine {{reached its peak}} intensity as it passed 280km (175mi) to the north-northeast of New Caledonia, with wind speeds of 215km/h (135mph), equivalent to a Category4 cyclone on both the Australian and Saffir-Simpson hurricane scales (SSHS). Throughout 8February, Jasmine began to show characteristics of an annular hurricane, maintaining a large, asymmetric eye and rather shallow convective features. In addition, multiple eyewall mesovorticies developed within the eye.|$|E
5|$|The system {{developed}} on January13 between the Philippines and Guam. Moving west-northwest for its duration, Mekkhala passed north of Yap State on January14 while slowly intensifying due to moderate wind shear. Conditions became more favorable on January16, {{when the storm}} quickly strengthened to peak winds of at least 110km/h (70mph); <b>a</b> <b>ragged</b> eye prompted the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to upgrade it to a typhoon. The storm weakened slightly and made landfall on the Philippine island of Samar on January17. Mekkhala weakened further over land, dissipating on January21 east of Luzon.|$|E

5|$|A mid- to upper-level trough {{slowed the}} storm {{almost to a}} halt early on August 23, before a drift to the north-northwest began. The next National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{advisory}} then reported that the eye was becoming more distinct and well-defined. This strengthening trend abated because the storm had churned up the waters over which it was passing, bringing cooler water to the surface {{as a result of}} the slow track. Another inhibiting factor may have been related to the same trough that caused the northward turn, though due to a large anticyclone situated over the hurricane, the weakening effects were not substantial. Despite wind shear, the large and powerful circulation resisted weakening for a time. Early on August 25, the shear and the entrainment of drier air into the hurricane took its toll on Bonnie, giving it <b>a</b> <b>ragged</b> appearance on satellite imagery, and the eye briefly became cloud-filled.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Cristobal was a {{moderately}} strong Atlantic tropical cyclone that affected multiple landmasses from Puerto Rico to Iceland in late August and early September2014. Slow to develop, and plagued by unfavorable wind shear {{for most of}} its life, the storm formed on August23 near the Caicos Islands from a long-tracked tropical wave. Moving generally northward, Cristobal gradually intensified despite <b>a</b> <b>ragged</b> appearance on satellite imagery, and passed midway between Bermuda and North Carolina on August 27. While accelerating toward the northeast the next day, Cristobal achieved its peak strength as a Category 1hurricane. A colder environment converted Cristobal into an extratropical cyclone on August29, but it retained much of its strength as it sped across the northern Atlantic and struck Iceland on September1.|$|E
5|$|In {{the hours}} after {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the deep convection {{associated with the}} depression decreased, though it again increased later in the day. <b>A</b> <b>ragged</b> rainband developed in the southeastern quadrant of the circulation, and based on increased Dvorak numbers and improved presentation on satellite imagery, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Barbara on May 30 while it was located about 115miles (185km) south of Puerto Escondido. This marked only the third time on record that two storms formed in May in the basin, after 1956 and 1984. Initially, Barbara was forecast to intensify to attain hurricane status and reach winds of 85mph (135km/h).|$|E

5|$|Initially, Cecil was {{forecast}} {{to maintain}} a northward track into a weakness in a subtropical ridge left behind by Typhoon Brenda; however, Cecil turned westward on May23 due to another ridge over China. With favorable atmospheric conditions, Cecil continued to intensify through May24. By 0600UTC, <b>a</b> <b>ragged</b> 75km (45mi) wide eye developed over the center of circulation, indicating {{it had become a}} typhoon. The storm ultimately attained peak winds of 140km/h (85mph) while situated just off the coast of central Vietnam. However, the JMA reported Cecil to have been slightly weaker, classifying it as a severe tropical storm with ten-minute sustained winds of 110km/h (70mph). Around 1800UTC, the storm made landfall near Hoi An with winds of 130km/h (80mph). Once onshore, Cecil quickly weakened to a tropical depression. Turning slightly to the west-northwest, the remnants of Cecil continued inland before dissipating over eastern Laos early on May26.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} tracked westward {{due to a}} {{ridge to}} its north. Its circulation was initially broad and ill defined, with patches of disorganized convection due to dry air. The depression was able to intensify due to generally favorable conditions, and the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Ma-on at 0600UTC on July12. Gradually the thunderstorms became concentrated around the center, despite restricted outflow {{to the north and}} west. Ma-on intensified at a slower than climatological rate, although an eye feature became evident by early on July13. At 0000UTC that day, the JMA upgraded Ma-on to a severe tropical storm, and 24hours later the storm intensified into a typhoon to the northeast of the Northern Marianas. By that time, it was also located about 970km (575mi) southeast of Iwo Jima. <b>A</b> <b>ragged</b> eye became apparent on satellite imagery, and after developing an anticyclone aloft, its outflow became much better defined.|$|E
5|$|The storm slowly {{strengthened}} {{over the}} warm {{waters of the}} eastern Atlantic thereafter as it tracked west-northwest. Some dry air from the Saharan Air Layer continued to slow development on September 14 as Helene remained a low-end tropical storm. However, a bout of intensification took place on September 15 as shear diminished. The storm became much better organized with well-defined banding, and leveled off that evening at just under hurricane intensity. On the morning of September 16, the storm began to develop <b>a</b> <b>ragged</b> eye, and the storm strengthened to hurricane status. The intensity leveled off for a while as a marginal Category 1 hurricane, as the intensification was slowed {{by the presence of}} moderate wind shear despite the absence of significant dry air. Late that evening, the storm began to slowly intensify once again.|$|E

5|$|There {{was a pause}} of {{uncertain}} length (eyewitness estimates {{ranged from}} several seconds to two minutes), after which the soldiers fired into the crowd. Rather than a disciplined volley (Preston gave no orders to fire), <b>a</b> <b>ragged</b> series of shots was fired, which hit eleven men. Three Americansâ€”ropemaker Samuel Gray, mariner James Caldwell, and Crispus Attucksâ€”died instantly. Samuel Maverick, an apprentice ivory turner of seventeen, {{was struck by a}} ricocheting musket ball {{at the back of the}} crowd, and died a few hours later, in the early morning of the next day. An Irish immigrant, Patrick Carr, died two weeks later. Christopher Monk, another apprentice, was one of those seriously wounded in the attack. Although he recovered to some extent, he was crippled and eventually died in 1780, purportedly due to the injuries he had sustained in the attack a decade earlier.|$|E
5|$|Tracking west-northwestward {{and then}} westward along the {{southern}} periphery of a subtropical ridge, Mekkhala was upgraded to a tropical storm by the JTWC early on January 15, due to its slightly improved structure. Mekkhala quickly intensified {{on the next day}} due to improved conditions; the wind shear became in-phase with the storm's motion while the robust divergent outflow persisted. Therefore, the JMA upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm at 06:00UTC on January16, and later that day the JTWC upgraded it to a typhoon, when a central dense overcast has significantly deepened and totally obscured the LLCC. Later, a microwave imagery revealed that Mekkhala formed <b>a</b> <b>ragged</b> eyewall structure. The system reached peak intensity at 00:00UTC on January 17 with ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 110km/h (70mph), although operationally the JMA estimated typhoon-force winds of 130km/h (80mph).|$|E
5|$|Within {{minutes of}} issuing the signal and turning his {{flagship}} HMS Queen Charlotte, Howe's plan began to falter. Many of the British captains had either misunderstood or ignored the signal and were hanging {{back in the}} original line. Other ships were still struggling with damage from Howe's earlier engagements and could not get into action fast enough. The result was <b>a</b> <b>ragged</b> formation tipped by Queen Charlotte that headed unevenly for Villaret's fleet. The French responded by firing on the British ships as they approached, {{but the lack of}} training and coordination in the French fleet was obvious; many ships which did obey Howe's order and attacked the French directly arrived in action without significant damage.|$|E

5|$|A small {{circulation}} formed {{north of}} the Cocos Islands on January8 within the near-equatorial trough. For about a week, it drifted west-southwestward without much development, although an area of convection formed within the system on January11 about 1240km (770mi) southwest of Sumatra. Persistent wind shear prevented much strengthening, and the circulation crossed into the south-west Indian Ocean on January16. Another increase in convection merited its classification as a tropical disturbance on the next day, which organized into a central dense overcast. Slow development continued, allowing the disturbance to become a tropical depression and later Tropical Storm Charly on January19. On the same day, the JTWC also began tracking it as Tropical Cyclone 06S. Taking a track similar to earlier Tropical Cyclone Bindu, the storm moved southwestward around a ridge to the south. Charly gradually developed outflow and increasingly organized convection due to decreasing wind shear. <b>A</b> <b>ragged</b> eye formed on January20 and became better defined, and early on January21, Charly intensified into a tropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|After moving ashore, Beryl quickly {{weakened}} to {{a tropical}} depression. It slowed {{due to the}} weakening ridge to its north, and an approaching cold front turned it {{to the north and}} northeast on May29. Despite being well inland, Beryl retained enough convection to remain a tropical cyclone. As Beryl approached the Atlantic Ocean on May30, its convection increased to the south and east of the center, although the intrusion of dry air resulted in <b>a</b> <b>ragged</b> appearance on satellite imagery. Based on reports from ships, Beryl was upgraded to a tropical storm on May30 near the South Carolina coastline. The approaching front caused the storm to accelerate northeastward. Beryl's circulation became elongated and its associated convection spread northward, suggesting the transition into an extratropical cyclone. By late on May30, Beryl became extratropical, prompting the NHC to discontinue advisories. The storm continued to the northeast, later turning to the east-southeast. On June2, a larger extratropical storm absorbed the remnants of Beryl to the southeast of Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|As Tingting tracked northwestward, it {{continued}} to develop outflow in all directions. The storm slowly intensified as it traveled towards the Mariana Islands, strengthening into a severe tropical storm early on June27. Later that day, <b>a</b> <b>ragged</b> eye began to form. The ridge influencing the track of Tingting moved eastward, causing the storm to begin a gradual turn towards the north At 0000UTC on June28, the JTWC upgraded the storm to a minimal typhoon, {{the equivalent of a}} Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and the JMA followed about six hours later. Several hours later, Tingting passed through the central Mariana Islands, tracking near the small island of Sarigan, while continuing to intensify. At 0900UTC, the typhoon reached its peak intensity with winds of 150km/h (90mph) according to both agencies and a minimum pressure of 955hPa (mbar). With low wind shear, further strengthening was anticipated as it neared the Bonin Islands. However, the typhoon began to weaken due to increasing dry air and decreasing sea surface temperatures. On June30, Tingting passed within 95km (60mi) east of Iwo Jima. Later that day, the storm's eye dissipated as convection around the center of circulation weakened.|$|E
