40|$|Public Awarding Authorities {{around the}} world aim at {{procuring}} construction contracts that will achieve project completion within predefined cost, time and quality constraints. Nowadays, national and supranational public works programmes define strict completion dates at the client's risk of losing funding if deadlines are not met. The choice of procurement method is therefore of utmost importance. In most cases, the client's award is based on financial offers only. As the construction time for project completion within funding programme targets is extremely important, {{it should also be}} considered as an <b>award</b> <b>criterion.</b> In this paper, the most common award methods are evaluated and a new one is proposed. The <b>award</b> <b>criterion</b> considered is the most economically advantageous tender as defined in the European Union Legislation and takes into account the construction cost and completion time. The evaluation of both financial and time offers is carried out by implementing utility theory. An illustrative example is provided. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

25|$|The Royal Air Force Long Service and Good Conduct Medal {{was instituted}} by King George V in 1919, the year {{following}} {{the establishment of}} the world's first independent Air Force. The medal could be awarded to Regular Force non-commissioned officers and airmen of the Royal Air Force. The <b>award</b> <b>criteria</b> was later relaxed to also allow the award of the medal to officers who had served a minimum period in the ranks before being commissioned.|$|E
25|$|In March 2015 the {{intention}} to introduce a single new long service medal for all three Arms of the Service was announced, to replace the Medal for Long Service and Good Conduct (Military), the Naval Long Service and Good Conduct Medal (1848) and the Royal Air Force Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. The proposed medal will be awarded after fifteen years of service, regardless of rank, and while the good conduct element of the <b>award</b> <b>criteria</b> will remain, it will only apply to {{the last five years}} of the fifteen-year aggregate time served requirement. With this medal Officers, who have had no medallic recognition for long service unless they were commissioned after serving at least twelve years in the ranks, will also be rewarded for their dedication. Subject to agreement from Her Majesty The Queen, a new medal design will be commissioned and the first presentations should take place in 2016.|$|E
25|$|The {{momentum}} {{to create a}} new honour typically originates at either the Chancellery of Honours or the Department of National Defence, though private organisations or individuals may also make proposals. The chancellery will investigate whether or not the suggested honour is necessary and if it will conform within the national honours structure. Should it meet these criteria, the notion is put before the Honours Policy Committee—a group of senior public servants, formed in 1980 within the Privy Council Office—and then, if approved, is moved before the Cabinet for an Order in Council to be drawn up. On the prime minister's advice, via the governor general, the documents and drawings for the new honour are presented to the Queen for her consideration; only with her signature on the relevant letters patent and the design sketches does the new honour officially become extant. Any future amendments to the honour's appearance or <b>award</b> <b>criteria</b> do not need the monarch's approval; the governor general will perform such tasks instead.|$|E

40|$|In {{procurement}} operations, if {{the lowest}} bid proposed by a vendor is accepted as the <b>awarding</b> <b>criterion</b> {{that is less}} than the base price, it is not uncommon that the bidder may first offer an unreasonably low price to gain the right to supply, and then provide low-quality products in the future. Regardless of whether this fraudulent behavior can be identified, the company or agency inviting the bid is consequently impeded from receiving products that meet their needs. To address this issue, the most advantageous bid (MAB) method can be adopted as an alternative <b>awarding</b> <b>criterion.</b> However, when practicing MAB, the weighting of evaluation criteria and sub-criteria frequently presents a challenge for companies or government agencies offering an invitation for bid. Based on extant literature on supplier evaluation theories, this study conducts interviews with experts to determine evaluation criteria and sub-criteria for MAB, and analyzes the weights of evaluation criteria and subcriteria. A fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) is performed to analyze the obtained MAB evaluation criteria and subcriteria. The results of the study provide a reference for any company or government agency seeking to evaluate MAB...|$|R
