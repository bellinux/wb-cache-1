In the project, ice storage for cold source and electric boiler thermal storage for heat source are taken while variable primary flow is used for water system. Taking into account the functions of each part, all air and fan coil unit with fresh air system are applied in ventilation system. The design of <b>air</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> is introduced. A detail scheme about the annual operational regulation for energy saving is proposed. During the designing process, energy conservation is given enough attention, and the reliability of operation is also ensured...|$|E
40|$|The {{operation}} of an <b>air</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> or fuel-burning appliance removes {{air from the}} house, creating a negative pressure in the building. If too much air is removed and the negative pressure becomes large enough, the natural flow of gases up the furnace chimney can be reversed. The flow of combustion products into the home can create a danger of carbon monoxide poisoning. The digest describes a study conducted to determine the relationship between carbon monoxide poisoning and the air tightness of a house.

40|$|International audienceUsed as {{a solvent}} in the dry-cleaning industry, {{tetrachloroethylene}} (C 2 Cl 4) {{can be a}} pollutant of residential indoor air, which can cause long-term harmful exposures because of its neurotoxicity and probable carcinogenicity. In France, dry-cleaning facilities are integrated in urban environments (shopping malls, residential buildings) and can contribute to C 2 Cl 4 exposure for customers and residents. This exploratory work presents the results from five studies carried out in one shopping mall and four residential buildings housing a dry-cleaning facility. These studies involved dry-cleaning machines fitted with a Carbon Adsorber and unfitted, with or without <b>Air</b> <b>Exhaust</b> <b>System.</b> Samples were collected in the cleaning facilities and in the apartments located above with passive samplers allowing measurement of time-integrated concentrations on a 7 days sampling period.

To temper these results, it must be pointed out that some parameters (building insulation, amount of solvent used [...] .) which would influence C 2 Cl 4 fugitive release have not been quantified and should be looked at in further studies...|$|E

40|$|This report summarises {{the work}} of WP 4, {{a part of the}} METRO project. It investigates theperformance of various smoke control systems for use in {{underground}} stations having only one exit to ground level. Two different smoke control systems with two different configurations were investigated: A pressurizing (positive pressure) supply air system; a pressurizing supply air system with platform screen doors; a mechanical <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> <b>system</b> with extraction fittings above the track area; and a mechanical <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> <b>system</b> with platform screen doors. Simulations were performed using Fire Dynamics Simulator, investigating two different heat release rates – 20 MW and 60 MW. The results show that both the pressurizing supply air system and the mechanical <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> <b>system</b> provide effective smoke control. The advantages of a positive pressure supply air system are a relatively simple installation and a lower requisite flow capacity of the fans. The disadvantage is that the smoke is not dispelled, but can be spread to other platforms of the station and even to the next station. The advantages of a mecha- nical <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> are that the hot smoke is removed, and that the spread of smoke is restricted to the platform directly exposed to the fire. Disadvantages include the needfor a duct system, which requires space, and considerably higher fan capacities. METRO-projekte...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> energy {{recovery}} turbine generator {{is designed to}} recover part of the energy in the discharged <b>air</b> from an <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> <b>system.</b> The design {{is a combination of}} H-rotor vertical axis wind turbines (installed in cross-wind position), guide-vanes and a diffuser. Its working principle was tested on a scaled model of cooling tower and simulated in a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) package. From the guide-vanes study, optimum guide-vanes arrangement is 100 ̊, 70 ̊ and 90 ̊. The system with optimized guide-vanes arrangement produced the highest torque coefficient compared to the other configurations. The average torque coefficient of the system was increased by 24. 3 % with the introduction of diffuser and guide-vanes at optimized angles, i. e. from 0. 029 to 0. 036. From the graph of the torque coefficient versus azimuth angle, the overall positive torque zone was increased with the introduction of the guide-vanes with optimum configuration.

The new rating system produced lower, more realistic numbers for any given engine. At the same time, emissions regulations were demanding cleaner exhaust. Engines including the 440 were made with reduced compression, modified cam timing, and other tuning measures to comply with the newly tightened emissions regulations. The 1972 440 produced [...] (gross) at 4400 rpm; the new net rating was —which very closely coincided with period German DIN ratings and TÜV measurements.|$|R
