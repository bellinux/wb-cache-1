Because {{little is known about the}} influences of stereotyping on <b>assessment</b> <b>interviews,</b> the objectives of this paper were to qualitatively investigate: (1) the content of stereotypes used to classify claimants with regard to the way in which they communicate; (2) the origins of such stereotypes; (3) the advantages and disadvantages of stereotyping in assessment interviews; and (4) how social insurance physicians minimise the undesirable influences of negative stereotyping. Methods: Data were collected during three focus group meetings with social insurance physicians who hold medical disability <b>assessment</b> <b>interviews</b> with sick-listed employees (i. e. claimants).

She described and proved that children show specific patterns of behavior in the playroom and repeat certain play themes according to their diagnosis. She also developed a questionnaire that the child psychiatrist uses during an <b>assessment</b> <b>interview</b> to measure the level of personality integration in adolescents, depending on their capacity to relate to peers and friends. She developed a standardized interview that is done to the mother and child when they are in front of a mirror, and also developed a similar instrument to assess the personality integration of adolescents. Kernberg was the first who described and studied with statistical analysis the early signs of personality disorders, which she said were already present and treatable in children and adolescents.|$|E

40|$|Background: Given {{the high}} {{prevalence}} {{of mental health}} and/or substance use problems in young people, an <b>assessment</b> <b>interview</b> that assists clinicians to engage with young people and assess their psychosocial needs is essential. Currently, there are few assessment tools for this purpose. Objective: To describe the rationale and process of extending a psychosocial <b>assessment</b> <b>interview</b> to assist clinicians in assessing {{the full range of}} mental health disorders common in young people. Discussion: The 'headspace' <b>assessment</b> <b>interview</b> is designed to assist engagement while assessing psychosocial and mental health problems. It can be used by a range of clinicians in primary care settings for the purposes of developing treatment or referral options. To date, as part of a national clinical service platform, the interview has been used with over 2000 young people.
