25|$|The Union {{advance on}} Fort Pulaski began on November 24, 1861. Following {{reconnaissance}} that Confederates had abandoned Tybee Island, Flag Officer Du Pont ordered forward an <b>amphibious</b> <b>raid</b> with three gunboats at the Tybee Island Lighthouse. Under a two-hour ship’s bombardment, the Confederate pickets {{set fire to}} the lighthouse and withdrew. Commander Christopher Rodgers, USS Flag, led a landing party of sailors and Marines in thirteen surf-boats to occupy the Lighthouse and the Martello tower, and flew the national flag from them. Overnight, a reduced company set false campfires to misdirect the Confederates ashore. Two days later commanding Flag Officer Du Pont and General Thomas Sherman made a personal reconnaissance, and on 29 November, General Gillmore, the command’s chief engineering officer, with three companies of the Fourth New Hampshire, took formal possession of the entire island without opposition. The Navy set the logistics train in motion, and by December 20, the Army had sufficient materials for establishing “a permanent possession”.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{principles}} of war have a central but debated role in modern doctrine with heritage {{dating back to}} Sun Tzu. Despite that the principles are used in several modern doctrines, there is surprisingly little research to be found on these principles. The {{principles of}} security and surprise, are both argued as being key components in amphibious operations, though {{can also be seen}} as contradictory. Method: This thesis explores the principles of war by studying the theory of security, developing a theory with a set of success factors. These factors consist of physical protection, information supremacy and reserves. Hypothetically, the presence of these factors explains the outcome of <b>amphibious</b> <b>raids.</b> The theory is examined in a qualitative text analysis on two case studies on the raids on St Nazaire and Makin Island where the success factors are tested by a deductive dihedral design. The results open for a final discussion in comparison with Jimmy Johansson’s research of the principle of surprise previously made on the same raids. Results: The results show that security, through the presence of success factors, is positively affecting the outcome of <b>amphibious</b> <b>raids,</b> though further research is necessary. Security and surprise although contradictory can work in synergy with a successful surprise element leading to increased security and information supremacy a prerequisite for surprise. ...|$|R
