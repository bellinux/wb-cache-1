50|$|As of January 2011, IVI {{includes}} 40 {{countries and}} the World Health Organization (WHO) as signatories to its Establishment Agreement. To be more specific, there are 33 signatory countries, which are the states that express their consent to be bound by a treaty by signing the treaty {{without the need for}} ratification, <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval.</b> These states may definitively sign a treaty only when the treaty so permits. In addition, there are 16 parties which involve Liberia, Republic of Korea, Brazil, Mongolia, China, Sri Lanka, Ecuador, Sweden, Netherlands, Oman, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Peru, Philippines, and the World Health Organization (WHO). A major difference between a signatory and a party is that a party to a treaty is a state or other entity with treaty-making capacity that has expressed its consent to be bound by that treaty by an act of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession etc. where that treaty has entered into force for that particular State.|$|E

Objectives: We present {{a case study of}} the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ’s decision to withdraw the indication of bevacizumab for the treatment of advanced breast cancer and include an analysis of the reactions of stakeholders with a view to identifying opportunities for improving risk management for new medicines with conditional approval or funding. Methods: We drew on a range of information sources, including FDA documents, medical journals and media reports, to describe the evidentiary basis of the FDA decisions. We analysed the reactions and perspectives of the stakeholders. Results: In 2008 bevacizumab was granted conditional approval for treatment of advanced breast cancer by the FDA pending submission of supplementary satisfactory evidence. In 2011 the FDA decision to withdraw the indication was met with a hostile reaction from many clinicians and cancer survivors. There were different interpretations of the therapeutic value of bevacizumab with strong beliefs among cancer survivors that the medicine was effective and potential harm was manageable. High expectations of the public may have been encouraged by overly positive media reports and limited understanding by the public of the complexity of the scientific evaluation of new medicines and of the regulatory processes. Conclusions: Improving understanding and <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> or coverage schemes conditional to evidence development may require the development of risk management plans by regulatory and funding institutions. They may include a range of strategies such as requirements for formal patient acknowledgment of the conditional availability of the medicine, ‘black-triangle ’ equivalent labels that identify full approval is based on pending evidence, and ongoing communication with the media, public and health professionals...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Due to its {{promising}} properties, hydrogen {{has become}} increasingly interesting for transporta-tion applications. Nevertheless, possible applications also require answers {{to the question of}} how to establish and demonstrate sufficient safety to achieve society’s <b>acceptance</b> and <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> authorities. This paper addresses these questions and is organized as follows: First, we start with a short overview of basic properties of hydrogen and current ideas of using it for aircrafts and cars. After a review of basic risk and safety aspects we then discuss how risk strategies are realized within the automotive sector where the development has progressed significantly during the last years. Next, we describe the tolerable risk target for hydrogen in aircrafts. Finally, we discuss an overall approach which includes the basic philosophy of risk management, the already existing safety concepts, tools and methodologies and also the existing experiences of handling hydrogen in other industries...|$|R

As the French Revolution changed the lives of virtually everyone in the nation and even continent because of its drastic and immediate shift in social reformation, it greatly influenced many writers at the time.

40|$|In today’s {{competitive}} market, {{survival and}} response to customer needs and expectations are enabled through high-quality products for low costs – quality products provided by suppliers fulfilling today’s quality-requirements for a low price. Companies have until recent years selected suppliers only according to a pricing structure, leaving other criteria’s, such as quality, behind. The purpose of this master thesis is therefore to investigate quality aspects that must be considered from a supplier evaluation perspective and design a simple evaluation tool for first-time supplier selections. Both new and existing suppliers will be tested with the tool according to information given during a case study made at Flexit AS, a Norwegian ventilation-systems company looking to introduce a structured approach for selecting suppliers. Through an extensive literature- and empirical study, where a survey, of which evaluation criteria’s {{to be included in}} the evaluation tool, was conducted together with several both semi-structured and unstructured interviews, a foundation for the design of the tool was presented. Quality management systems and quality performance measurements, such as rejection rate and delivery precision, are considered as fundamental aspects to consider when assessing a supplier. <b>Acceptance</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> are set according to in-house objectives. If any evaluation tool including quality should be usable, an in-house quality system must therefore first be implemented by the in-house company – a notable improvement recommended to the case company. The design of the tool given from the thesis provides the evaluator with an opportunity to visualize and compare existing suppliers according to five criteria’s including cost, together with an additional spreadsheet for evaluation of new suppliers put forward as a foundation and an indicator if new suppliers are considering quality on a basic level...|$|R

The churches were not only affected by the emergency measures and the rationing, but also by division among themselves. Many members fiercely opposed war participation and supported the Ossewabrandwag as a resistance organisation, with the <b>acceptance</b> and <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> the local church council. Other members supported the war effort, which led to much tension in the congregations and in relationships. This division had such an influence on the congregations that churches rather strived towards peace in the congregations than to pastorally {{address the needs of}} the affected. Churches comfortably shifted this responsibility onto the civil organisations such as the Ossewabrandwag Emergency Fund, State funding and the provision of Field preachers by the government.

40|$|This article investigates {{a growing}} <b>acceptance</b> and <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> {{cosmetic}} surgery among Americans. An analysis of recent {{media coverage of}} cosmetic surgery reveals two dominant nar-rative frames that project favorable interpretations of cosmetic surgery. Several normalizing themes within these narrative frames are highlighted, including associations between cosmetic surgery and scientific progress, technological innovation, and mental and physical health. Common portrayals of the body undergoing cosmetic surgery are also analyzed, with attention drawn {{to the ways in}} which these portrayals promote normal-ized understandings of cosmetic surgery. In the last sections of this article, the author suggests some potential consequences of the normalization of cosmetic surgery: virulent forms of social control, a disruption of mind-body reflexivity, and a loss of the body’s innate capacity for knowledge. Author’s note: I would like to thank Stephen Pfohl, Juliet Schor, and all members of the editorial collective at the Boston College Sociology Department for their helpful comments on earlier drafts of this article. * This phrase is taken from an article on cosmetic surgery in the May 20 th, 2002 issu...|$|R
