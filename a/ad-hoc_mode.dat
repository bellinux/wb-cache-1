The mechanism maintains application transparency by virtualizing the wireless card, while using commodity hardware and an off-the-shelf unmodified driver. Our work is motivated by observed significant differences in performance between Wi-Fi infrastructure vs. Wi-Fi <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>modes.</b> The improvement is obtained through two complementing schemes.

40|$|Interest {{on using}} mobile {{autonomous}} agents has been growing, recently, {{due to their}} capacity to cooperate for diverse purposes, from rescue to demining and security. Such cooperation typically requires the exchange of state data that is time sensitive and thus, applications {{should be aware of}} data temporal coherency. In order to provide such information a real-time communications protocol must be used to prevent unbounded latency of message delivery. This is, however, not a trivial task when using wireless links because of their poor reliability properties, exhibiting high bit error rates, omissions and inconsistencies.

40|$|Aim of {{thesis is}} to reduce the data traffic from mobile network by {{exploiting}} <b>Ad-hoc</b> <b>modes</b> of communication. This can be achieved by sending message to few mobile nodes which will forward data to rest of the mobile nodes via Ad-hoc communication. This thesis focuses on selection of those few mobile nodes (Target Set) which will receive message directly from mobile network and can effectively reduce the data traffic on mobile network by forwarding that message to many other mobile nodes via Ad-hoc communication. Thesis consists of two tasks. First task of thesis is to implement the concept of Mobile Traffic Offloading on android based smart phones using desktop as server and two smart phones as its clients. Second task of the thesis is to implement the same concept on a large scale with more scope for Target Set selection. Second task consists of five different approaches for the selection of Target Set of mobile. First approach is Random approach, in this approach server sends message to a randomly selected Target Set of mobile nodes from all available mobile nodes. Second and third approaches are Distance and Distance Extended. These approaches considers the euclidean distance between each pair of mobile nodes. Distance approach considers the current euclidean distance and checks the possibility of Ad-hoc communication. Distance Extended approach uses the current distance between the mobile nodes and also calculates the probabilistic future distance between mobile nodes. Fourth approach is Same Street, this approach considers the position of mobile nodes on the street map and uses that position to find Target Set of mobile nodes. Final approach of thesis is Path Length approach. This approach also is a map based approach and finds shortest distance between each pair of mobile nodes. This approach also considers the probability of Ad-hoc communication in future. Finally this thesis presents the evaluation for both tasks. Evaluation of first task shows that how message delay changes with increase in message size. Evaluation of second task compares all Target Set selection approaches on the basis of number of Ad-hoc messages, Message Delay and Energy Consumption.

In this work, {{we are concerned}} with the distributed, peer-to-peer management of large corpora of XML documents, based on distributed hash table (or DHT, in short) overlay networks. We present ViP 2 P (standing for Views in Peer-to-Peer), a distributed platform for sharing XML documents based on a structured P 2 P network infrastructure (DHT). At the core of ViP 2 P stand distributed materialized XML views, defined by arbitrary XML queries, filled in with data published anywhere in the network, and exploited to efficiently answer queries issued by any network peer. ViP 2 P allows user queries to be evaluated over XML documents published by peers in two modes. First, a long-running subscription mode, when a query can be registered in the system and receive answers incrementally when and if published data matches the query. Second, queries can also be asked in an <b>ad-hoc,</b> snapshot <b>mode,</b> where results are required immediately and must be computed {{based on the results of}} other long-running, subscription queries.

50|$|Support for {{wireless}} networks {{is built}} into the network stack itself as a new set of APIs called Native Wifi, and does not emulate wired connections, {{as was the case with}} previous versions of Windows. This allows implementation of wireless-specific features such as larger frame sizes and optimized error recovery procedures. Native Wifi is exposed by Auto Configuration Module (ACM) which replaces Windows XP's Wireless Zero Configuration. The ACM is extensible, so developers can incorporate additional wireless functionality (such as automatic wireless roaming) and override the automatic configuration and connection logic without affecting the built-in framework. It is easier to find wireless networks in range and tell which networks are open and which are closed. Hidden wireless networks, which do not advertise their name (SSID) are better supported. Security for wireless networks is improved with improved support for newer wireless standards like 802.11i. EAP-TLS is the default authentication mode. Connections are made at the most secure connection level supported by the wireless access point.

40|$|The {{construction}} of a wireless multimedia ad-hoc network needs to go across the mixed environment with the indoor, the wall-penetration, and the outdoor condition. This paper presents our contribution to address the system design aspects of a multimedia-enabled network based on IEEE 802. 11 g <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>mode.</b> There are distinct differences between indoor and outdoor environment and penetrating the walls stressed the system limit of the 802. 11 g <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>mode.</b> Therefore, routing decisions should be made intelligently with the environmental respect to maximize the bandwidth support on the end-to-end paths. By investigating the experimental results of the average throughput with the 802. 11 g <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>mode,</b> we have collected the different performance characteristics among the indoor, the wall-penetration and the outdoor environment. Via the experiments and analyses, we have observed that the <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>mode</b> had the worst performance within 5 meters in indoor environments. In outdoor environments, TCP seemed to favor either short distance (e. g., 5 meters) or long distance (e. g., 25 meters). On the other hand, the best performance UDP has achieved with the distance of 10 meters. When the wall-penetration occurs, {{it is important that}} the routing nodes in the building edge areas are placed close-by within 5 meters. Given the solid evidences from the baseline experiments, we have embedded the heuristic algorithms into the routing decisions. We have thus simulated a large area of 300 meters by 300 meters with hundreds of routing nodes. After investigating over 100 (randomly-generated) topology scenarios, the performance results indicate that our proposed scheme produces the higher-bandwidth paths for most of the cases. Even in the less-dense cases, our proposed schemes still can find the better paths with bandwidth about 30 % higher than the conventional methods...|$|E
40|$|Physical layer capture (PLC) in 802. 11 b {{refers to}} the {{successful}} reception of the stronger (higher signal strength at receiver) frame in a collision. PLC causes significant imbalance in the throughputs of sources. Existing 802. 11 b simulators, including NS- 2 and Qualnet, assume that PLC occurs only if the reception of stronger frame starts first at the receiver. We show empirically that in reality PLC occurs even if the stronger frame arrives later (but within the physical layer preamble of the first frame). We have modified the NS- 2 simulator to account for this and Qualnet will be incorporating a fix in their next release. Simulations using the latter PLC model generate significantly (up to 15 %) higher, and more realistic, throughput unfairness than with the former PLC model. We also show that time-instants of start of colliding frames routinely differ {{by as much as}} 20 due to inherent uncertainties of 802. 11 b firmware clock synchronization and rx/tx turnaround delays, and that the frame to arrive first can be either the stronger or the weaker with equal likelihood. To identify which frames were involved in collisions, when their transmissions started, and which of them were retrieved, we have devised a novel technique using multiple sniffers and instrumented device drivers to reconstruct from the air interface all tx/rx events in a WLAN to within 4 accuracy. This allows us to quantify the causal links from the PHY layer through the MAC layer to the observed application layer imbalance, which may be as high as 25 % with two sources and 75 % with four sources as seen in experiments spanning <b>ad-hoc</b> and infrastructure <b>modes</b> with both UDP and TCP workloads...|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{expansion of}} wireless networks has brought new attractive possibilities to end users. In {{addition to the}} mobility capabilities provided by unwired devices, it is worth remarking the easy configuration process that a user has to follow to gain connectivity through a wireless network. Furthermore, the increasing bandwidth provided by the IEEE 802. 11 family has made possible accessing to high-demanding services such as multimedia communications. Multimedia traffic has unique characteristics that make it greatly vulnerable against network impairments, such as packet losses, delay, or jitter. Voice over IP (VoIP) communications, video-conference, video-streaming, etc., are examples of these high-demanding services that need to meet very strict requirements {{in order to be}} served with acceptable levels of quality. Accomplishing these tough requirements will become extremely important during the next years, taking into account that consumer video traffic will be the predominant traffic in the Internet during the next years. In wired systems, these requirements are achieved by using Quality of Service (QoS) techniques, such as Differentiated Services (DiffServ), traffic engineering, etc. However, employing these methodologies in wireless networks is not that simple as many other factors impact {{on the quality of the}} provided service, e. g., fading, interferences, etc. Focusing on the IEEE 802. 11 g standard, which is the most extended technology for Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), it defines two different architecture schemes. On one hand, the infrastructure mode consists of a central point, which manages the network, assuming network controlling tasks such as IP assignment, routing, accessing security, etc. The rest of the nodes composing the network act as hosts, i. e., they send and receive traffic through the central point. On the other hand, the IEEE 802. 11 <b>ad-hoc</b> configuration <b>mode</b> is less extended than the infrastructure one. Under this scheme, there is not a central point in the network, but all the nodes composing the network assume both host and router roles, which permits the quick deployment of a network without a pre-existent infrastructure. This type of networks, so called Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs), presents interesting characteristics for situations when the fast deployment of a communication system is needed, e. g., tactics networks, disaster events, or temporary networks. The benefits provided by MANETs are varied, including high mobility possibilities provided to the nodes, network coverage extension, or network reliability avoiding single points of failure. The dynamic nature of these networks makes the nodes to react to topology changes as fast as possible. Moreover, as aforementioned, the transmission of multimedia traffic entails real-time constraints, necessary to provide these services with acceptable levels of quality. For those reasons, efficient routing protocols are needed, capable of providing enough reliability to the network and with the minimum impact to the quality of the service flowing through the nodes. Regarding quality measurements, the current trend is estimating what the end user actually perceives when consuming the service. This paradigm is called Quality of user Experience (QoE) and differs from the traditional Quality of Service (QoS) approach in the human perspective given to quality estimations. In order to measure the subjective opinion that a user has about a given service, different approaches can be taken. The most accurate methodology is performing subjective tests in which a panel of human testers rates the quality of the service under evaluation. This approach returns a quality score, so-called Mean Opinion Score (MOS), for the considered service in a scale 1 - 5. This methodology presents several drawbacks such as its high expenses and the impossibility of performing tests at real time. For those reasons, several mathematical models have been presented in order to provide an estimation of the QoE (MOS) reached by different multimedia services In this thesis, the focus is on evaluating and understanding the multimedia-content transmission-process in wireless networks from a QoE perspective. To this end, firstly, the QoE paradigm is explored aiming at understanding how to evaluate the quality of a given multimedia service. Then, the influence of the impairments introduced by the wireless transmission channel on the multimedia communications is analyzed. Besides, the functioning of different WLAN schemes in order to test their suitability to support highly demanding traffic such as the multimedia transmission is evaluated. Finally, as the main contribution of this thesis, new mechanisms or strategies to improve the quality of multimedia services distributed over IEEE 802. 11 networks are presented. Concretely, the distribution of multimedia services over ad-hoc networks is deeply studied. Thus, a novel opportunistic routing protocol, so-called JOKER (auto-adJustable Opportunistic acK/timEr-based Routing) is presented. This proposal permits better support to multimedia services while reducing the energy consumption in comparison with the standard ad-hoc routing protocols. Universidad Politécnica de Cartagen...|$|R
40|$|The {{study is}} {{motivated}} by the need for better insight {{into the nature of}} the demand for fuel stations, in particular how this demand is influenced by the fact that consumers have to make their decision where to refuel “on-the-fly”. There is only limited literature on this topic. Most of the existing studies in refuelling consist of aggregate analyses that have a lack of emphasis on understanding the consumers’ decision making process and approaches to choice modelling not taking into account the unique characteristics of the fuel retail market. Fuel retailing is distinct from most other retailing in both supply and demand side aspects. The supply side displays a high level of vertical integration and the product is commoditized and homogeneous. The demand side is characterized {{by the fact that the}} fuel consumer is moving across the market space and makes the decision where to refuel “on-the-fly”, during their trip to some final destination. These distinctions have significant implications for the modelling of the demand for fuel (or gas) stations. Firstly the final destination and the refuel location do not coincide. Secondly there is endogeneity in the choice set development process. The third complexity is that the impact of the spatial structure of alternatives on the consumer’s choice depends on the consumer’s direction of movement. The current research was conducted to enhance the capacity of existing theories to model “on-the-fly” choice behaviour, especially in the fuel retailing market. The main objectives of the research include the investigation of the consideration set generation process in on-the fly situations, the spatial modelling of fuel retail consumer’s choice behaviour, and the modelling of spatial competition among fuel stations. The study develops and tests a model that is based on the random utility model framework but with some modification in the specification of the spatial variables to take into account an individual’s relative path of movement. The model is estimated using data obtained from a field survey in the city of Bandung, Indonesia. For the survey, sampled consumers were intercepted during their refuelling activities and interviewed to gather information regarding their trip attributes and their alternative refuelling location options. The research then separated into three different modelling studies, firstly, a study of the role of accessibility as a determinant of an individual’s choice set, secondly, a study into the modelling of the refuelling activity as an on-the-fly choice, and finally, a study into the modelling of spatial competition in fuel retail market. The first study is a simulation study of refuelling choices of simulated individuals in a hypothetical grid-city. Two different simulations reflecting different spatio-temporal simulations are generated to answer the research question whether variation in the decision maker’s level of accessibility to the alternatives impacts the role of the consideration set in the spatial choice model. The simulated data are used to estimate both a single-stage simple Multinomial Logit model and a two-stage Constrained Multinomial Logit in order to test whether the inclusion of the consideration stage improves the modelling performance. The study findings confirm that the role of the consideration set depends on the level of accessibility. The more restrictions are imposed on access, the more important the consideration set becomes in setting the outcome of the choice process and the more superior the two-stage model becomes compared to the single stage model. The second study models actual refuelling behaviour as an “on-the-fly” choice. Two models are developed by using the field observation data from Bandung to empirically model the two different modes of the consumer’s refuelling behaviour, as defined in the literature: a planned choice <b>mode</b> and an <b>ad-hoc</b> search <b>mode.</b> The results from the study confirm our proposition that a consumer in planned choice mode emulates a typical stage-wise choice behaviour, signified by a rational compensatory trade-off between spatial and non-spatial effects with a significant role for the accessibility-driven consideration set, while ad-hoc search consists of sequential search behaviour, wherein spatio-temporal limitations diminish the role of the accessibility driven consideration set and signify the role of spatial variables over a non-spatial attractiveness variable. In comparison to other spatial models in the literature, the current model performs better in terms of both the model fit criteria and predictive capability. By integrating the choice model developed in the current study with the spatial interaction model framework, the spatial substitutability among all gas stations in the study area is modelled. The main objective of this exercise is to propose a costumer oriented market delineation, in which the spatial substitutability between spatially differentiated firms is measured through the perspective of consumer consideration rather than through the firms’ spatial locations. The study finds that the spatial competition between firms is heavily affected by the spatio- temporal context. First the substitutability between pairs of spatially competing firms varies based on their spatio-temporal situations. Secondly, the relationship between spatial competition and spatial structure (e. g. clustering and spatial differentiation) is dependent on the consumers’ behavioural modes, that is, whether they are in choice mode or in search mode. Finally, in the last section of the thesis, the managerial implications and the limitation of the study are discussed together with some proposals for future research avenues...|$|R

It leverages {{the latest developments in}} the area of password-based authentication and (group) Diffie-Hellman key exchange to develop a provably-secure key-exchange protocol for IEEE 802. 11 ’s <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>mode.</b> The protocol allows users to securely join and leave the wireless group at time, accommodates either a single-shared password or pairwise-shared passwords among the group members, or at least with a central server; achieves security against dictionary attacks in the ideal-hash model (i. e. random-oracles). This is, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, the first such protocol to appear in the cryptographic literature...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{medium access control}} (MAC) {{protocol}} to support the multi-channel operation for dedi-cated short range communication (DSRC). In particular, {{we focus on the}} challenge of providing potentially high-bandwidth for non-safety applications provided by road-side infrastructure, without compromising safety commu-nication occurring in a separate channel. In our architec-ture, when a vehicle approaches a DSRC service hot-spot, it switches from the <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>mode</b> to the coordinated mode (and switches back to ad-hoc as it leaves the hotspot’s range). This coordinated mode is a variant of IEEE 802. 11 PCF, modified for multi-channel operation. The coordinated mode maximizes utilization of the DSRC “service channels ” in the DSRC hot-spots while allowing safety-message broadcasts to be received with high probability in a distinct “safety chan-nel”. When a vehicle is not within the range of a DSRC hot-spot, the vehicle can use any of the previously-proposed ad-hoc protocols. Our approach can use any of these ad-hoc protocols for its <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>mode.</b> The MAC protocol is simu-lated with realistic mobility trace, and verified that it meets our safety and service objectives...|$|E
30|$|Routing When an {{incoming}} Hiker packet is received, the destination {{field of the}} packet is checked. If the destination is the local sensor node, it is passed to the transport layer. If the destination matches a known route, it is transmitted on the appropriate link using the transmit(frame,link) method of Hitch. If no route is known, the packet is discarded. Sections 4 and 5 explains the route discovery process of Hitch Hiker in infrastructure and <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>mode,</b> respectively.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{demand for}} video content is {{continuously}} increasing as video sharing on the Internet is becoming enormously popular recently. This demand, with its high bandwidth requirements, has a considerable {{impact on the}} load of the network infrastructure. As more users access videos from their mobile devices, the load on the current wireless infrastructure (which has limited capacity) {{will be even more}} significant. Based on observations from many local video sharing scenarios, in this paper, we study the tradeoffs of using Wi-Fi <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>mode</b> versus infrastructure mode for video streaming between adjacent devices. We thus show the potential of direct device-to-device communication as a way to reduce the load on the wireless infrastructure and to improve user experiences. Setting up experiments for Wi-Fi devices connected in <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>mode,</b> we collect measurements for various video streaming scenarios and compare them to the case where the devices are connected through access points. The results show the improvements in latency, jitter and loss rate. More importantly, the results show that the performance in direct device-to-device streaming is much more stable in contrast to the access point case, where different factors affect the performance causing widely unpredictable qualities.

30|$|Mani et al. [7] {{proposed}} SCOPE: A Prototype for Spontaneous P 2 P Social Networking. It provides customized {{social networking}} application for local use cases. Below the network level, SCOPE relies on 802.11 <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>mode</b> and needs no infrastructure. SCOPE follows the hierarchical P 2 P model. Some nodes with higher computing capability become super-nodes. Super-nodes form an overlay {{and provide the}} distributed data management system for the P 2 P social network. Client nodes connect to super-nodes and rely on them for sharing their contents or accessing to the shared information.|$|E
40|$|Ad hoc {{networks}} are the special networks formed for specific applications. Operating in <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>mode</b> allows all wireless devices {{within range of}} each other to discover and communicate in a peer-to-peer fashion without involving central access points. Many routing protocols like AODV, DSR etc have been proposed for these networks to find an end to end path between the nodes. These routing protocols are prone to attacks by the malicious nodes. There {{is a need to}} detect and prevent these attacks in a timely manner before destruction of network services. Comment: 14 pages, 7 figures, 1 tabl...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This article {{presents}} experimental results {{of cooperation between}} wireless IEEE 802. 11 a/b/g cards coming from different vendors, working in <b>ad-hoc</b> <b>mode.</b> The throughput efficiency {{of each of the}} cards was analysed in two different configuration scenarios consisting of two or three cards working together. Emphasis was put on the multirate adaptation abilities of the cards, which utilize such modulation techniques as DBPSK, DQPSK, CCK, and OFDM. The achieved results, presented in the form of figures, show that cards manufactured by independent vendors perform differently. Therefore, choosing the optimum configuration, according to the user’s requirements, is possible. I...|$|E
