5000|$|Three-dimensionality in {{turbomachine}} increases {{complexity in}} flow field so, determination of losses becomes difficult unlike two-dimensional losses where equation complexity is little. Three-dimensionality includes large pressure gradients in every direction, design/curvature of blade, shock wave, heat transfer, cavitation and viscous effects, which generates secondary flow, vortices, tip leakage vortices and other losses. Viscous effects in turbomachinery causes blockage to the flow by formation of viscous layers around blade profile which effect pressure rise/fall and reduce effective area of flow field. Interaction between these losses in rotor increase instability and decreases in efficiency of turbomachinery. In calculation of three-dimensional losses every parameter comes into picture of flow path like axial spacing between vane and blade rows, end wall curvature, radial distribution of pressure gradient, hup/tip ratio, dihedral, lean, tip clearance, flare, aspect ratio, skew, sweep, platform cooling holes, surface roughness, off take bleeds. Associated with blade profile like camber distribution, stagger <b>angle,</b> <b>blade</b> spacing, blade camber, chord, surface roughness, leading and trailing edge radii, maximum thickness. So, correlations {{are dependent on}} so many parameter it becomes difficult to correlate. Correlation based on geometric similarity has been developed by many industries in form of charts, graphs, data statistics and performance data. Two-dimensional losses are easily evaluated by Navier-Stokes code but three-dimensional losses are difficult to evaluate so, correlation is used. Three-dimensional losses are mainly classified as: ...|$|E

Little formal evaluation exists for specifically designed percutaneous extramedullary implants. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare 3 locked plating constructs, all with percutaneous insertion capability, with the standard 95 -degree <b>angled</b> <b>blade</b> plate to determine whether specifically designed fixed-angle extramedullary implants for subtrochanteric femur fractures were biomechanically comparable to the <b>angled</b> <b>blade</b> plate. Methods: Forty composite adult femurs were divided into 4 equal groups. The constructs evaluated included a 95 -degree <b>angled</b> <b>blade</b> plate, a broad 4. 5 -mm combination locking plate, and a precontoured proximal femoral locking plate (PFLP) with and without an oblique, angled strut or ‘‘kickstand’’screw. A 30 -degree wedge osteotomy was used to create a subtrochanteric fracture gap model. Each specimen underwent axial and torsional stiffness testing along with cyclic axial loading to failure.

In this paper, a numerical study {{has been carried out}} in order to investigate the effect of <b>blade</b> <b>angle</b> on the performance of a regenerative pump. Two groups of impellers were employed. The first type has symmetric <b>angle</b> <b>blades</b> with identical inlet/outlet angles of ± 10 °, ± 30 °, and ± 50 ° and the second group has nonsymmetric <b>angle</b> <b>blades</b> in which the inlet angle was set to 0 ° and six different angles of ± 10 °, ± 30 °, and ± 50 ° were designed for the outlet of the blades.

30|$|Reconstruction was {{performed}} with a nine-hole 95 ° <b>angle</b> <b>blade</b> plate and cancellous bone graft. The patient {{was placed in}} a lateral decubitus position; through a lateral approach, the hip plate and the screws were removed, and the lateral aspect of femur and the non-union site were exposed. At the same time, autogenous bone for graft was harvested from the ipsilateral anterior iliac crest. The fracture site was found to be grossly unstable under the stress of abduction and adduction by manual testing. Fibrous tissue between fracture ends was removed by curettage, and a 60 -mm length <b>angle</b> <b>blade</b> plate inserted into the original window for the previous hip plate supplemented with a 60 -mm cancellous screw in order to secure the proximal fragment. Following this, the non-union was reduced and the distal segment fixed to the shaft of the <b>angle</b> <b>blade</b> plate through six screws (12 cortices). Finally, autogenous bone graft was packed around the fracture site. To prevent implant overloading, partial weight-bearing was not permitted until eight weeks following surgery.|$|E
30|$|The {{blade of}} the <b>angle</b> <b>blade</b> plate offers good {{purchase}} of the proximal fragment and secures it under rotational and bending stresses.

This was borne by the mobility of the patient recovering to the pre-injury level within three months following our treatment and the non-union radiologically healed at 10 months after surgery. We recommend that distal fragments should be fixed with at least seven cortices {{for this type of}} osteotomy.|$|E
