5|$|Sonnet 18 is {{a typical}} English or Shakespearean sonnet. It {{consists}} of three quatrains followed by a couplet, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> characteristic rhyme scheme: abab cdcd efef gg. The poem reflects the rhetorical tradition of an Italian or Petrarchan Sonnet. Petrarchan sonnets typically discussed the love and beauty of a beloved, often an unattainable love, but not always. It also contains a volta, or shift in the poem's subject matter, beginning with the third quatrain.|$|E
5|$|When {{initially}} established, the F-FDTL land force comprised two light infantry battalions, {{each with}} an authorised strength of 600 personnel. Each battalion has three rifle companies, a support {{company and a}} headquarters company. Although the army is small, the guerrilla tactics employed by FALINTIL before the departure in 1999 of the Indonesian Armed Forces were effective against overwhelming numbers <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> potential to form a credible deterrent against invasion. The Army's current doctrine is focused on low-intensity infantry combat tactics as well as counter-insurgency tasks. Most of the force's training and operations are conducted at the section level, and company or battalion-sized exercises are rare.|$|E
5|$|Lethbridge {{is split}} into three {{geographical}} areas: north, south and west. The Oldman River separates West Lethbridge {{from the other}} two while Crowsnest Trail and the Canadian Pacific Railway rail line separate North and South Lethbridge. The newest of the three areas, West Lethbridge (pop. 36,716) {{is home to the}} University of Lethbridge, opened at that site in 1971, but the first housing was not completed until 1974 and the prime Whoop-Up Drive access opened only in 1975. Much of the city's recent growth has been on the west side, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> youngest median age of the three. The north side (pop. 26,751) was originally populated by workers from local coal mines. It has the oldest population of the three areas, is home to multiple industrial parks and includes the former Hamlet of Hardieville, which was annexed by Lethbridge in 1978. South Lethbridge (pop. 31,337) is the commercial heart of the city. It contains the downtown core, the bulk of retail and hospitality establishments, and the Lethbridge College.|$|E

30|$|When {{grown by}} itself, V. {{americana}} aboveground biomass {{did not differ}} among soil or fertilizer treatments, likely due to its ability to fix nitrogen. Growth of M. perforata was directly related to soil nitrogen, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> greatest increase in biomass with fertilization. Growth and biomass of G. boreale was less than <b>the</b> other species, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> highest mortality in the nitrogen-poor soil. When grown together, the proportional biomass of M. perforata and V. americana varied with soil treatment such that M. perforata was dominant in the high-nitrogen forest floor-mineral mix treatment while V. americana was dominant in the low-nitrogen peat-mineral mix.|$|R

25|$|In {{probability}} theory and statistics, the exponential distribution (also known as negative exponential distribution) is the probability distribution {{that describes the}} time between events in a Poisson process, i.e. {{a process in which}} events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate. It is a particular case of the gamma distribution. It is the continuous analogue of the geometric distribution, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> key property of being memoryless.

Smaller amounts of these materials are shipped via road and railway to the large metropolitan areas of New Zealand itself, such as Auckland, Wellington and Hamilton.|$|E

Conversely, only 16.0% of people from Brussels work outside Brussels (68 827 (68.5%) of them in Flanders and 21 035 (31.5%) in Wallonia). Not all of the wealth generated in Brussels remains in Brussels itself, and as of December 2013, the unemployment among residents of Brussels is 20.4%.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} insoforms of NKCC2 created by {{alternative}} splicing (NKCC2A, B and F). Each {{one of these}} insoforms is expressed at different portions of the thick ascending limb and they have different affinity for sodium that correlates with its localization. The insoform F is more predominant in the deeper portion of the thick ascending limb, where the sodium concentration is very high. NKCC2F is the isoform with the lowest affinity for sodium and this allows the cotransporter to work at this sodium rich environment. Conversely, NKCC2B is expressed at the more superficial portion of the thick ascending limb and the macula densa, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> highest affinity for sodium. This permits NKCC2B to function in this sodium-depleted environment without saturating. The NKCC2A isoform shows an intermediate distribution and affinity for sodium. In this way, NKCC2 is able to function properly along the range of sodium concentrations found along the thick ascending limb.|$|E
25|$|The Hughes H-4 Hercules (also {{known as}} the Spruce Goose; {{registration}} NX37602) is a prototype strategic airlift flying boat designed and built by the Hughes Aircraft Company. Intended as a transatlantic flight transport for use during World War II, it was not completed in time {{to be used in}} the war. The aircraft made only one brief flight on November 2, 1947, and the project never advanced beyond the single example produced. Built from wood because of wartime restrictions on the use of aluminum and concerns about weight, it was nicknamed by critics the Spruce Goose, although it was made almost entirely of birch. The Hercules is the largest flying boat ever built, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> largest wingspan of any aircraft that has ever flown.
