5|$|The {{propellers}} of a DC-6 {{are designed}} to provide reverse thrust after the aircraft touches down. The pilot then retards the throttle levers to a point below idle speed and that directs the electric mechanisms in the propeller hub to rotate the blades to a position in which they will provide reverse thrust. Should the pilot need to perform <b>a</b> <b>go-around,</b> he moves the thrust levers forward to a positive position again and that will produce forward thrust, enabling the pilot to execute <b>a</b> <b>go-around</b> maneuver.|$|E
5|$|On March 14, 1980, LOT Polish Airlines Flight 007, an Ilyushin Il-62, {{attempted}} <b>a</b> <b>go-around</b> {{when the}} crew experienced troubles with a gear indicator. When thrust was applied, the low pressure turbine disc in engine number 2 disintegrated because of material fatigue; {{parts of the}} disc damaged engines number 1 and 3 and severed control pushers for both horizontal and vertical stabilizers. After 26 seconds of uncontrolled descent, the aircraft crashed, killing all 87 people on board.|$|E
5|$|Owing to the {{confluence}} of these problems, the Census was completed and tabulated several months behind schedule to much popular criticism, and led indirectly to a deterioration in Walker's health {{during the spring of}} 1871. Walker took leave to travel to England with Bowles that summer to recuperate and upon return that fall, despite an offer from The New York Times to join their editorial board with an annual salary of $8,000 ($ in 2016), accepted Secretary Columbus Delano's offer to become the U.S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs in November 1871. The appointment was simultaneously <b>a</b> <b>go-around</b> to continue to fund Walker's federal responsibilities as Census superintendent despite Congress' cessation of appropriations for the position as well as a political opportunity to replace a scandal-ridden predecessor. Walker continued to work on the Census for several years thereafter, culminating in the publication of the Statistical Atlas of the United States that was unprecedented in its use of visual statistics and maps to report the results of the Census. The Atlas won him praise from both the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution as well as a First Class medal from the International Geographical Congress.|$|E

The aircraft attempted a tailwind landing in low-level windshear and gust conditions, then declared a missed approach and executed <b>a</b> <b>go-around.</b> Upon the second landing attempt, the aircraft touched down, bounced airborne again and slammed into the runway, coming to rest upside-down near the departure end, in flames and its right wing separated from the airframe. One crewmember was killed; another crewmember and a passenger sustained serious injuries.|$|E
25|$|Star Air's only hull-loss {{accident}} {{took place}} on 26 May 1988. The Fokker F-27 OY-APE flew from Copenhagen to Billund, where to loaded cargo and continued onwards to Hannover Airport and Nuremberg Airport. The cargo was improperly distributed so that the aircraft became aft-heavy. Although the captain was aware of this situation, he did not relay {{the information to the}} first officer, who was the pilot flying. He therefore failed to correlate for this during the landing at Hannover, having the flaps set incorrectly. When the first officer power up for <b>a</b> <b>go-around,</b> the load shifted, the aircraft pitched up and the aircraft crashed. Both pilots were killed.|$|E
25|$|On 19 March 2016, at 3:42 AM local time, Flydubai Flight 981, a Boeing 737-800 on a {{passenger}} flight from Dubai, while executing <b>a</b> <b>go-around,</b> crashed {{at a high}} angle and speed {{by the end of}} Runway 22. All 62 people aboard died in the crash. The crash damaged 350 sq.meters of the airport's only runway and destroyed ten runway lights. The airport was closed down for several days for the air crash investigation's field survey and the runway repairment. The circumstances and reasons of the crash are still to be determined by the Russian Interstate Aviation Committee, with the participation of the airline's specialists and foreign experts, who continue the investigative actions in the airport.|$|E

The fatal crash was a controlled flight into terrain accident, killing all 105 passengers and 8 crew on board. The aircraft was completely destroyed by impact with the water. The crash was caused by inadequate control inputs of the captain following <b>a</b> <b>go-around</b> after the first attempted approach. Contributing factors to the accident were the lack of necessary monitoring of the aircraft descent parameters by the first officer, and the improper reaction of the crew to the subsequent ground proximity warning system warning. Poor visibility and weather contributed to the crash as well.|$|E
25|$|The AETs {{final report}} into the {{incident}} was released on 10 December 2012. The report revealed {{that the cause of}} {{the incident was}} errors by Air Traffic Control (ATC). The van had been instructed to vacate the runway but ATC had failed to confirm that the instruction had been received and executed before giving the aircraft permission to land. The van and aircraft were using different radio frequencies and therefore each was unaware of the other. A failure to use standard radio phraseology was found to have been a contributory factor in the incident. The van had been seen by the crew just before they landed but it was assessed that a collision would still have occurred had <b>a</b> <b>go-around</b> been initiated. Twelve recommendations were made in the AETs final report. These included the installation of equipment that was capable of recording ATC communications with at least the previous 24 hours recordings being retained.|$|E
25|$|After {{successfully}} transporting {{the patient}} from Tingwall Airport in the Shetland Islands to Inverness, the pilot, nurse, and physician were {{returning to their}} home base in Tingwall. There was a strong and gusting right crosswind at the runway. The pilot's approach procedure required him to make right turns to line up with the runway. However, these right turns obscured the pilot's view of the runway, and when the pilot made his final right turn, the aircraft had been blown {{to the left of}} the runway, too far to make a safe landing. The pilot executed <b>a</b> <b>go-around</b> procedure and attempted another approach. Again, the aircraft was blown far {{to the left of the}} runway centreline, and during the final approach turn, the aircraft lost a great deal of altitude, striking the ground 1.5km short of the runway and approximately 0.3km to the left of the runway centreline. The AAIB determined that nighttime visibility of the airport environment was inadequate, especially during right crosswind conditions, and recommended the Tingwall Airport add additional ground lighting to aid pilots' ability to acquire the runway during nighttime approaches.|$|E
50|$|Malaysia Airlines Flight 2133 (MH2133/MAS2133) was a {{scheduled}} domestic passenger flight from Kota Kinabalu to Tawau which crashed due to pilot error on 15 September 1995, taking {{the lives of}} 32 of the 49 passengers and 2 of the 4 crew on board.
