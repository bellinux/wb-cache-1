500|$|In 1989, Hawke {{made his}} {{breakthrough}} appearance in Peter Weir's Dead Poets Society, playing {{one of the}} students taught by Robin Williams's inspirational English teacher. The Variety reviewer noted [...] "Hawke, as the painfully shy Todd, gives a haunting performance." [...] The film received considerable acclaim, winning the BAFTA Award for Best Film and an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. With revenue of US$235million worldwide, it remains Hawke's most commercially successful picture to date. Hawke later described the opportunities he was offered {{as a result of the}} film's success as critical to his decision to continue acting: [...] "I didn't want to be an actor <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> college. But then the [...] success was so monumental that I was getting offers to be in such interesting movies and be in such interesting places, and it seemed silly to pursue anything else." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, Blackman had an {{opportunity}} to work with Lenny Kravitz. From New York, Blackman talked over the phone with Kravitz in Los Angeles, and played drums for him as he listened. Kravitz immediately asked Blackman to fly out to LA. [...] "Lenny asked me can you play something for me over the phone", Blackman says. [...] "So I put the phone down and I started playing something like, BOOSH-bat-bat, BOOSH-BOOSH-BOOSH-bat, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the phone and I said, 'Can you hear that?' He said, 'Yeah. Can you fly out to L.A. right now?'" [...] "I flew out the next morning. While I'm downstairs waiting for the instruments to come from the studio, these people started coming in. First 12, and then like 30 more. I was like, 'whoa, this is an audition'. I ended up playing and instead of staying for one or two days, I stayed for two weeks and did the first video that I did with him, [...] "Are You Gonna Go My Way". Apart from 2004, I played with him ever since." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Washburn, he and Cimino {{spent three}} days {{together}} in Los Angeles at the Sunset Marquis, hammering out the plot. The script eventually went through several drafts, evolving into a story with three distinct acts. Washburn did not interview any veterans to write The Deer Hunter nor do any research. [...] "I had a month, that was it," [...] he explains. [...] "The clock was ticking. Write the fucking script! But all I {{had to do was}} watch TV. Those combat cameramen in Vietnam were out there in the field with the guys. I mean, they had stuff that you wouldn't dream of seeing about Iraq." [...] When Washburn was finished, he says, Cimino and Joann Carelli, an associate producer on The Deer Hunter who went on to produce two more of Cimino's later films, took him to dinner at a cheap restaurant off the Sunset Strip. He recalls, [...] "We finished, and Joann looks at me across the table, and she says, 'Well, Deric, it's fuck-off time.' I was fired. It was a classic case: you get a dummy, get him to write the goddamn thing, tell him to go fuck himself, put your name on the thing, and he'll go away. I was so tired, I didn't care. I'd been working 20 hours a day for a month. I got on the plane the next day, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Manhattan and my carpenter job." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of {{most famous}} Crow leaders to {{encounter}} the Little People was the legendary Crow chief Plenty Coups (Aleek-chea-ahoosh). When he {{was nine years}} old, Plenty Coup's older brother (who was a great warrior and quite handsome, and whom Plenty Coups loved deeply) was killed by raiding Lakotas. Although the tribe was preparing to move out, Plenty Coups fasted for four days, used the sweat lodge, rubbed his body with sage and cedar to remove any smell, and then went into the nearby hills where he had a vision. In his vision, {{the chief of the}} Little People took him into a spirit-world lodge, where Plenty Coups saw representations of nature (the wind, the stars, thunder, the Moon, bad storms, etc.). The dwarf chief demanded that Plenty Coups count coup, but since Plenty Coups was just nine years of age he knew that he had no great deeds to count. Nonetheless, the chief of the Little People recounted two great deeds to the spirits gathered in the lodge, and said that Plenty Coups would not only accomplish these deeds but many others as well. He also prophesied that Plenty Coups would become chief of his people, if he used his wits, and then advised Plenty Coups to develop his willpower so that he could lead his people. [...] "I had a will and I would use it, make it work for me, as the Dwarf-chief had advised. I became very happy, lying there looking up into the sky. My heart began to sing like a bird, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the village, needing no man to tell me the meaning of my dream. I took a sweat-bath and rested in my father's lodge. I knew myself now." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, no--because the {{interest}} will increase and the plot will thicken. It simply can't not," [...] I insisted.

6000|$|After another {{broadside}} for the Doctor, {{and another}} for the Doctor's wife, the boys dispersed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> into the house, where I found the guests all standing in a group about the Doctor, discussing how Mr. Jack Maldon had gone away, and how he had borne it, and how he had felt it, {{and all the rest}} of it. In the midst of these remarks, Mrs. Markleham cried: 'Where's Annie?' ...|$|R
60|$|I put {{the candle}} out, and the {{blackness}} fell about me groping dark; {{it was like}} a crowd surrounding me; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the house of Durrisdeer, with my chin upon my shoulder, startling, as I went, with craven suppositions.

60|$|Every time I {{looked down}} at the chain on my {{waistcoat}} it reminded me of Sam. I looked on to the river and thought of 'im going down on the ebb.

60|$|Then {{we all got}} mad.

60|$|The day's {{lessons are}} over now, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to my bait-catching {{with a new}} admiration for these winged members of the brotherhood.

If I had only had some one to teach me like that, I should certainly now be a better fisherman.|$|R
6000|$|... "When the barber," [...] he continued, [...] "had {{finished}} his tale, {{we came to}} the conclusion that the young man had been right, when he had accused him of being a great chatter-box.

60|$|It {{occurred}} to me that perhaps I ought to bury him. At any rate, I ought to hide him.

60|$|I tried a last remonstrance {{before we}} {{returned}} to the house. She was just as immovable as ever. My mind was in a strange conflict of feelings about her when I left her that day.

I made her promise to write to me the moment she had any news to send. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my business in London, with a mind exceedingly ill at ease.|$|E
