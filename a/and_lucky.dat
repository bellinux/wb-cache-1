They played at Café Society Downtown on Mondays for six or seven months, which helped Waldron gain exposure and more work.

In 1955, Waldron worked with Lucky Millinder <b>and</b> <b>Lucky</b> Thompson. Waldron formed his own band in 1956, which consisted of Idrees Sulieman (trumpet), Gigi Gryce (alto saxophone), Julian Euell (bass), and Arthur Edgehill (drums).
