5|$|Fletcher {{graduated}} from the University of Kentucky and joined the United States Air Force to pursue his dream of becoming an astronaut.

5|$|Hugo Spadafora was <b>a</b> <b>physician</b> <b>and</b> {{political}} activist who had first clashed with Noriega {{when they were}} both members of Torrijo's government. Though an ally of Torrijos, he and Noriega had been personal enemies for a long time. Despite not {{being a member of the}} opposition, he became a vocal critic of Noriega after returning to Panama from Guatemala in 1981. Spadafora amassed evidence of corruption within the government by using his position as an ally of Torrijos to question Noriega's allies, including Rodriquez and Carlton. This included a lengthy conversation with Carlton in mid-1985 after his drug operations had collapsed due to conflicts over a missing shipment, and he had received negative publicity in the Panamanian press. In September 1985 he accused Noriega of having connections to drug trafficking and announced his intent to return to Panama to oppose him. The drug trafficking charges threatened Noriega's support among his own constituency of middle class individuals who had benefited under his and Torrijos' government.|$|E
