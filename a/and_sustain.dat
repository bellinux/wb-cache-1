5|$|Just {{like the}} many uses of plasma, {{there are several}} means for its generation, however, one {{principle}} is common to all of them: there must be energy input to produce <b>and</b> <b>sustain</b> it.

Although the shifting weather conditions themselves negatively affect bees, the link between colony collapse and climate change is also {{closely tied to the}} interaction between bees’ climatic niches and food-plant reductions. Climate change affects the floral environment by stunting flower development and nectar production, which in turn directly impacts colonies’ abilities to collect pollen <b>and</b> <b>sustain</b> themselves.|$|E

They also endorsed changes to NATO’s defence planning, hoping that the Alliance’s long-term defence planning process would become more flexible, thereby helping member countries generate forces that can reach further, faster and still take on the full range of missions.|$|E

5|$|The {{survival}} {{of a living}} organism depends on the continuous input of energy. Chemical reactions {{that are responsible for}} its structure and function are tuned to extract energy from substances that act as its food and transform them to help form new cells <b>and</b> <b>sustain</b> them. In this process, molecules of chemical substances that constitute food play two roles; first, they contain energy that can be transformed and reused in that organism's biological, chemical reactions; second, food can be transformed into new molecular structures (biomolecules) that are of use to that organism.|$|E
5|$|The {{unexpected}} deployment to East Timor in 1999 led {{to significant}} changes in Australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the ADF's ability to conduct operations outside Australia. This successful deployment {{was the first time}} a large Australian military force had operated outside of Australia since the Vietnam War and revealed shortcomings in the ADF's ability to mount <b>and</b> <b>sustain</b> such operations. In response, the 2000 Defence White Paper placed a greater emphasis on preparing the ADF for overseas deployments. The Australian government committed to improve the ADF's capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of ADF units, expanding the ADF to 57,000 full-time personnel and increasing real Defence expenditure by 3% per year.|$|E

5|$|Comprehensive Political Guidance (CPG), {{a policy}} {{document}} {{that had been}} agreed by Defence Ministers in June 2006 and an addition to the 1999 Strategic Concept document, was formally endorsed during the summit. The CPG intends to provide a framework and political direction for NATO's continuing transformation in the coming 10 to 15 years. More specifically, the document expresses {{the belief that the}} principal threats to the Alliance in the coming decades are terrorism, proliferation, failing states, regional crises, misuse of new technologies, and disruption of the flow of vital resources. According to this document, the Alliance should adapt to these new threats and sets out the Alliance vis-a-vis capability issues, planning disciplines and intelligence for the next 10 to 15 years, including among others the need for joint expeditionary forces and the capability to deploy <b>and</b> <b>sustain</b> them over long periods of time. The document further underlined that NATO's forces should be able to conduct a variety of missions, from high to low intensity, and emphasized the likelihood that NATO will need to carry out a greater number and range of smaller operations. The CPG also confirmed the principle that 40% of the member states' military forces must be redeployable, and 8% must constantly be on operations abroad. This principle makes it, among other things, possible to effectively compare the contributions made by various states, irrespective of the size of their populations.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of mining increased {{the migration of}} native African people in search of employment to the province from elsewhere in Africa. The mining industry improved {{the standard of living}} of those living along Northern Rhodesia's railroads, and increased the influx of white people, the Europeans from South Africa who wanted to maintain their superiority over the native African population. Native Africans were poorly treated by the whites and discouraged from working in the mines; this evolved into a racial struggle. The high rate of immigration to the region increased the number of unplanned settlements. The BSAC introduced a hut tax in 1901 in North-Eastern Rhodesia and between 1904 and 1913 in North-Western Rhodesia for all migrants. The tax was high (in some cases, six months' wages), and intended to create a system of debt bondage and generate income for investment in other mines. Unrest caused by tax increases was suppressed {{with the help of the}} British South Africa Police. The imposition of tax was a strategy adopted to create bond labour <b>and</b> <b>sustain</b> demand during the 1920s when the demand for miners was higher. The company was able to maintain low wages on account of predominance of migrant labour from rural regions. The African miners had three major issues: low wages compared to European miners, a prohibition against working in mines reserved for Europeans despite high skills, and workplace harassment and brutality.|$|E
