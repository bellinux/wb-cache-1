30|$|First, a {{subsistence}} <b>activity</b> {{is either}} <b>core</b> or auxiliary {{depending on the}} physiographic areas (i.e. coastal plains, high mountains, high plateaux, interior valleys and interior plains), their resource endowments, climactic condition and access to alternative livelihood opportunities outside the pastoralists' primary residential domain. I schematically illustrate the alternation between subsistence activities by comparing mostly herding and fishing while neglecting a miscellany of other activities: On the coastal plains, fishing is the <b>core</b> <b>activity,</b> while date cultivation and herding are auxiliary ones. Also, for a proportion of the coastal population, especially in the north, salaried employment is the <b>core</b> <b>activity</b> with trading as an auxiliary activity, and where the cultivation of dates is an un-remunerative tradition-bound endeavour, and fishing is either an occasional leisure, or supplementary income, activity. In the high mountains, herding is the <b>core</b> <b>activity</b> with negligible participation in auxiliary activities such as date cultivation. In the high plateau areas, herding is the <b>core</b> <b>activity</b> supplemented, in the central region, by date cultivation and the collection of resin from incense-bearing trees, and in the western region, some pastoralists migrate toward the southwestern coast for seasonal fishing. In the internal valleys, herding is the <b>core</b> <b>activity</b> with date cultivation as an auxiliary one, but assumes core status seasonally. In the internal plains, herding is the <b>core</b> <b>activity,</b> which is seasonally complemented by fishing on the northern coast as the auxiliary activity. However, the subsistence <b>activities,</b> whether <b>core</b> or auxiliary, in all the island's areas are regulated by the seasonal calendar, and in particular by the occurrence of monsoon winds and seasonal rains.|$|R
40|$|Daily {{activity}} patterns reflect {{interactions between}} circadian mechanisms and environmental stimuli. Among these stimuli, temperature {{can be an}} important factor affecting activity budgets. To sample the agouti (Dasyprocta azarae), a systematic camera-trap grid was established with 50 independent sampling sites. A circular kernel function was used to characterize the activity patterns of the agouti population. To evaluate shifts in activity as a function of mean daily temperature, the entire set of records was subdivided into smaller sets covering different temperature ranges. The activity pattern belonging to each set was characterized and compared through the overlap of their full activity (95 % isopleth) and <b>activity</b> <b>core</b> (50 % isopleth). Based on 400 independent records, agoutis were predominately diurnal. They shifted their <b>activity</b> <b>core,</b> while keeping their activity range (the amount of time a population remains active during the 24 -h cycle) constant through the temperature gradient. The agouti demonstrated a unimodal activity pattern at lower temperatures,which became more bimodal at higher temperatures. Nevertheless, it kept its activity range constant, regardless of temperature. These results likely reflect a trade-off between activity time and thermoregulation during the diurnal period and demonstrate how the agouti can change its behaviour to achieve thermal comfort. 201...|$|E

40|$|The exact {{mechanism}} for capillary occlusion in diabetic retinopathy is still unclear, but increased leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion has been implicated. We examined {{the possibility that}} posttranslational modification of surface O-glycans by increased <b>activity</b> of <b>core</b> 2 transferase (UDP-Glc:Galbeta 1 - 3 GalNAcalphaRbeta-N-acetylglucoaminyltr ansferase) is responsible for increased adhesion of leukocytes to vascular endothelium in diabetes. The mean <b>activity</b> of <b>core</b> 2 transferase in polymorphonuclear leukocytes isolated from type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients was higher compared with age-matched control subjects (1, 638 +/- 91 [n = 42] vs. 249 +/- 35 pmol x h(- 1) x mg(- 1) protein [n = 24], P = 0. 00013; 1, 459 +/- 194 [n = 58] vs. 334 +/- 86 [n = 11], P = 0. 01). As a group, diabetic patients with retinopathy had significantly higher mean <b>activity</b> of <b>core</b> 2 transferase compared with individuals with no retinopathy. There was a significant association between enzyme activity and severity of retinopathy in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. There was {{a strong correlation between}} <b>activity</b> of <b>core</b> 2 transferase and extent of leukocyte adhesion to cultured retinal capillary endothelial cells for diabetic patients but not for age-matched control subjects. Results from transfection experiments using human myelocytic cell line (U 937) demonstrated a direct relationship between increased <b>activity</b> of <b>core</b> 2 transferase and increased binding to cultured endothelial cells. There was no relationship between <b>activity</b> of <b>core</b> 2 transferase and HbA(1 c) (P = 0. 8314), serum advanced glycation end product levels (P = 0. 4159), age of the patient (P = 0. 7896), and duration of diabetes (P = 0. 3307). On the basis that branched O-glycans formed by the action of core 2 transferase participate in leukocyte adhesion, the present data suggest the involvement of this enzyme in increased leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion and the pathogenesis of capillary occlusion in diabetic retinopathy...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{maximize}} {{the sensitivity of}} detecting affects of genetic variants in mice, variables have been minimized {{through the use of}} inbred mouse lines, by eliminating infectious organisms and controlling environmental variables. However, the impact of standard animal husbandry and experimental procedures on the validity of experimental data is under appreciated. In this study we monitored the impact of these procedures by using parameters that reflect stress and physiological responses to it. Short-term measures included telemetered heart rate and systolic arterial pressure, core body temperature and blood glucose, while longer-term parameters were assessed such as body weight. Male and female C 57 BL 6 /NTac mice were subjected to a range of stressors with different perceived severities ranging from repeated blood glucose and core temperature measurement procedures, intra-peritoneal injection and overnight fasting to cage transport and cage changing. Our studies reveal that common husbandry and experimental procedures significantly influence mouse physiology and behaviour.

Although alterations in the performance of MeCP 2 -deficient mice in specific behavioral tasks have been documented, it remains unclear whether or not MeCP 2 dysfunction affects patterns of periodic behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. The aim of the current study was therefore to determine whether a deficiency in MeCP 2 is sufficient to alter the normal daily rhythmic patterns of core body temperature, gross motor activity and cortical delta power. To address this, we monitored individual wild-type and MeCP 2 -deficient mice in their home cage environment via telemetric recording over 24 hour cycles. Our results show that the normal daily rhythmic behavioral patterning of cortical delta wave <b>activity,</b> <b>core</b> body temperature and mobility are disrupted in one-year old female MeCP 2 -deficient mice. Moreover, female MeCP 2 -deficient mice display diminished overall motor activity, lower average core body temperature, and significantly greater body temperature fluctuation than wild-type mice in their home-cage environment. Finally, we show that the epileptiform discharge activity in female MeCP 2 -deficient mice is more predominant during times of behavioral activity compared to inactivity. Collectively, these results indicate that MeCP 2 deficiency is sufficient to disrupt the normal patterning of daily biological rhythmic activities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Matrix {{attachment}} regions (MARs) {{were used}} to increase resveratrol production in stilbene synthase (STS) gene-transformed tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) in this study. MARs are DNA sequences that bind to the cell’s pertinacious nuclear matrix to form DNA loop domains. A range of effects of MARs sequence on mean expression level and variation in expression of transgenes has been reported usually using b-glucuronidase (GUS) gene as reporter gene. The present study investigated the effects of MARs sequence from yeast on transgene expression of STS for the first time. The results of in vitro binding assay showed that the MARs sequence could specifically bind to the matrix of tobacco prepared by lihium diiodosalicylate (LIS) procedure. The stilbene synthase is the key enzyme in metabolic pathway of resveratrol biosynthesis and a cDNA for STS was cloned from Parthenocissus henryana (Hemsl.) Diels et Gilg by RT-PCR method with primers designed according to the conserved sequence of STS gene in grapevine. The cloned sequence showed high nucleotide identity (93. 8 %) with the STS gene of Vitis vinifera cv. Optima, and the predicted protein sequence also had Cys 164 <b>activity</b> <b>core</b> and IPNSAGAIAGN motifs which were specific for stilbene synthases.

40|$|III Zw 2 is the {{prototype}} of radio-intermediate quasars. Although there is the evidence of possessing strong jet, significant γ-ray emission has not been reported before. In this work, we carry out {{a detailed analysis of}} the latest Fermi-LAT Pass 8 data. No significant γ-ray signal has been detected in the time-averaged 7 -year Fermi-LAT data of III Zw 2, we however have identified two distinct γ-ray flares with isotropic luminosities of ∼ 10 ^ 45 erg s^- 1. Multiwavelength data analysis (including also the optical photometric observations from Yunnan Observatories) are presented and the main finding is the simultaneous optical and γ-ray flares of III Zw 2 appearing in Nov. 2009. Violent γ-ray variability with doubling timescale of 2. 5 hours was detected in another γ-ray flare in May 2010, for which the 3 -hour γ-ray peak flux is ∼ 250 times of the average flux in 7 years. Rather similar behaviors are observed in blazars and the blazar model can reasonably reproduce the spectral energy distribution of III Zw 2 in a wide energy range, strongly suggesting that its central engine resembles that of blazars. In view of its core which shares radio similarities with young radio sources together with the weak extended radio lobe emission, we suggest that III Zw 2 harbors a recurrent <b>activity</b> <b>core</b> and serves as a valuable target for investigating the fuelling and triggering of the activity in radio loud AGNs.

40|$|The {{unfolded}} protein response (UPR) is a signalling pathway {{leading to}} transcriptional activation of genes that protect cells from accumulation of unfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In yeast, {{the only known}} ER stress signalling pathway originates at the type I transmembrane protein kinase/endoribonuclease Ire 1 p. Ire 1 p regulates synthesis of the basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) -containing transcription factor Hac 1 p by controlling splicing of HAC 1 mRNA. Only spliced HAC 1 mRNA (HAC 1 i) is translated, and Hac 1 i p activates transcription of genes that contain a conserved UPR element (UPRE) in their promoters. Here, we demonstrate {{that in addition to}} this well-understood ER stress signalling pathway, a second, IRE 1, HAC 1 and UPRE-independent mechanism for transcriptional activation upon ER stress, exists in yeast. A genetic screen identified recessive SIN 4 alleles as suppressors of a defective UPR in ire 1 δ strains. Elevation of basal transcription in sin 4 strains or by tethering the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme with LexAp-holoenzyme component fusion proteins to a promoter allowed for activation of the promoter by ER stress in an IRE 1, HAC 1 and UPRE-independent manner.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} preliminary core sets {{of outcome}} variables for disease activity and damage assessment in juvenile {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (JSLE) and juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM). METHODS: Two questionnaire surveys were mailed to 267 physicians from 46 different countries asking each member to select and rank the response variables used when assessing clinical response in patients with JSLE or JDM. Next, 40 paediatric rheumatologists from 34 countries met and, using the nominal group technique, selected the domains {{to be included in}} the disease activity and damage core sets for JSLE and JDM. RESULTS: A total of 41 response variables for JSLE and 37 response variables for JDM were selected and ranked through the questionnaire surveys. In the consensus conference, domains selected for both JSLE and JDM activity or damage core sets included the physician and parent/patient subjective assessments and a global score tool. Domains specific for JSLE activity were the immunological tests and the kidney function parameters. Concerning JDM, functional ability and muscle strength assessments were indicated for both activity and damage core sets, whereas serum muscle enzymes were included only in the <b>activity</b> <b>core</b> set.
