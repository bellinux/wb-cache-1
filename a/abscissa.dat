40|$|AbstractInterpolatory {{integration}} {{rules of}} numerical stability are presented for approximating Cauchy principal value (p. v.) integrals ⨍− 11 f(t) /(t−c) dt and Hadamard finite part (f. p.) integrals ∫=− 11 f(t) /(t−c) 2 dt, − 1 <c< 1, respectively, {{for a given}} smooth function f(t). Present quadrature rules consist of interpolating f(t) at <b>abscissae</b> in the interval of integration [− 1, 1] except for the pole c, where neither the function value f(c) nor its derivative f′(c) is required, followed by subtracting out the singularities. We demonstrate {{that the use of}} both endpoints ± 1 as <b>abscissae</b> in interpolating f(t) is essential for uniformly approximating the integrals, namely for bounding the approximation errors independently of the values of c. In fact, for the f. p. integrals the use of double <b>abscissae</b> at both endpoints ± 1 as well as simple <b>abscissae</b> in (− 1, 1) enables the uniform approximations, while the use of simple <b>abscissae</b> at both endpoints ± 1 and those in (− 1, 1) is sufficient for the p. v. integrals. These facts suggest that finite Hilbert transforms (p. v. integrals) and their derivatives (f. p. integrals) with varied values of c could be approximated efficiently with the same number of <b>abscissae,</b> respectively. Some numerical examples are given...|$|R

40|$|The {{original}} purpose for the generalised quadrature rules was to tackle irregular oscillatory integrands on a finite interval [a, b]. As the work progressed {{it was clear}} that the same approach could be applied to infinite range and singular integrals. This paper deals with applications to infinite range integrals, with particular emphasis on non-exponential integrands (which make classical Laguerre less easy to apply effectively). The crucial feature to allow these integrals to be evaluated was to replace the usual cosine weighted <b>abscissae</b> (used in the irregular oscillatory case) with a geometric distribution, or use the <b>abscissae</b> 1 /xj. A third set of <b>abscissae</b> were obtained from transforming the cosine weighted points onto [0,inf]. Comparisons of these choices on a range of practical integrals completes the paper. The second class of singular integrals appears in a related publication not presented for the current exercise. This work extends generalised quadrature methods to infinite range problems which makes the method applicable to a much wider class of integrals...|$|R

Recently Gaussian quadrature with respect to discrete measures corresponding to finite sums has found some new interest.

The <b>abscissae</b> of the Gaussian summation have a very interesting asymptotic distribution function with a kink singularity.

40|$|The pro-isomorphic zeta {{function}} of a finitely generated nilpotent group Γ is a Dirichlet generating function that enumerates finite-index subgroups whose profinite completion is isomorphic to that of Γ. Such zeta functions can be expressed as Euler products of p-adic integrals over the p-adic points of an algebraic automorphism group associated to Γ. In this way they {{are closely related to}} classical zeta functions of algebraic groups over local fields. We describe the algebraic automorphism groups for a natural family of class- 2 nilpotent groups; these groups can be viewed as generalizations of D^*-groups of odd Hirsch length. General D^*-groups, that is `indecomposable' finitely generated, torsion-free class- 2 nilpotent groups with central Hirsch length 2, were classified up to commensurability by Grunewald and Segal. We calculate the local pro-isomorphic zeta functions for our groups and obtain, in particular, explicit formulae for the local pro-isomorphic zeta functions associated to D^*-groups of odd Hirsch length. From these we deduce local functional equations; for the global zeta functions we describe the <b>abscissae</b> of convergence and find meromorphic continuations. We deduce that the spectrum of <b>abscissae</b> of convergence for pro-isomorphic zeta functions of class- 2 nilpotent groups contains infinitely many cluster points. For instance, the global <b>abscissae</b> of convergence of the pro-isomorphic zeta functions of D^*-groups of odd Hirsch length are determined and yield the cluster point 6.
