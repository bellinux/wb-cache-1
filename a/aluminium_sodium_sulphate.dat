40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted on}} the anodisation of commercial grade <b>aluminium</b> in aqueous <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphate</b> and <b>sodium</b> oxalate solutions. The parameters investigated were anodisation potential and electrolyte composition. Degree of anodisation was evaluated by visual observation of the anodised surface, analyses of current-concentration graphs at constant potential and current-potential characteristics, and measurement of corrosion rate of the anodised surface. Anodisation potential played an important role on the degree of anodisation. The optimum potential was 400 mV and 800 mV wrt saturated Ag/AgCl (SSE) reference electrode for <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphate</b> and <b>sodium</b> oxalate solutions respectively. Below and above the optimum potential poor anodisation was due to insufficient production of Al 3 + to form anodic film and surface breakdown respectively. Anodisation increased with the increase of oxalate concentration. Sulphate concentration was less effective on the degree of anodisation. Between the two electrolytes sodium oxalate was more suitable than <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphate</b> for <b>aluminium</b> anodisation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{investigations}} {{involving the}} effect of ionization on the yields of radiation- chemical reaction in aqueous solutions suggest radi-cal diffusion model for various radiation-induced chemical reactions in aqueous media. Gamma radiolysis of acidic stannous chloride solu-tion at various absorbed doses and in presence of additives has been investigated. G(-Sn 2 +) is higher at the lower gamma dose. At the higher doses beyond 10 kGy the G values remain constant. The additives enhance the radiolytic transformation of stannous by energy transfer process. Presumably the additives exhibit sensitization effect. Efficiency of sensitization depends {{on the nature of}} the additives, concentration in the admixture and the absorbed dose. The additives were used in high concentration in contrast to the stannous chloride solutions. Thus, protection might be due to the shielding effect rather than scavenging.

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate, using an analysis of isobolograms, the type and the degree of the interaction between Cd(II) and <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphate</b> in the freshwater microalga Chlamydomonas moewusii. Two blocks of experiments were performed, one at sub-optimal <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphate</b> concentrations (14. 2 mg/L). Three fixed ratios (2 : 1, 1 : 1, and 1 : 2) of the individual EC 50 for cadmium and <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphate</b> were used within each block. The isobolographic analysis of interaction at sub-optimal concentrations showed a stronger antagonistic effect with values of interaction index (γ) between 1. 46 and 3. 4.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the treatment of various salt solutions and synthetic dye bath liquors by nanofiltration using Nanomax- 50 membrane in a stirred cell with 150 mL working volume. Donnan exclusion was compared by filtering salts with monovalent and divalent cations and anions. This was done by comparing three salts including sodium chloride (NaCl), calcium chloride (CaCl 2) and <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphate</b> (Na 2 SO 4). The rejection order determined was Na 2 SO 4 >NaCl>CaCl 2 which is typical of a negatively charged membrane where Donnan and steric exclusion {{play an important role}} in separation. Studies on the flux and rejection characteristics of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphate</b> were undertaken for concentrations ranging from 10 to 40 gl− 1 thereby replicating actual dye bath salt concentrations. Synthetic dye bath liquors were prepared using acidic dye (Acid Green 25) at a fixed concentration of 100 mgl− 1 with 10 and 15 gl− 1 of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphate</b> solutions. While, the results showed evidence of flux decline due to increased resistance and decreased transmembrane pressure, pore enlargement occurred after the filtration experiments with <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphate</b> solutions greater than 20 gl− 1. Pore enlargement was even more prominent in the two synthetic dye bath liquors filtered. Pore enlargement was determined by observing the pure water flux before and after filtering <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphate</b> solutions or dye bath liquors.

40|$|Salt {{crystallisation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} harmful decay problems in porous materials. Especially ancient building and archaeological sites can show very intense damage (e. g. detachment and pulverization of the materials) that produce a strong loss of matter and so cultural identity.

However also anthropic sources like pollution or cement can be found in these sites producing decay. <b>Sodium</b> <b>sulphate</b> is very common where there is the combination between cement and pollution. This salt is very harmful for porous materials due to his high crystallization pressure and the possibility to change to anhydrous phase to hydrated one.
