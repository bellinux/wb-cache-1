40|$|Examines whether {{each type}} of mental {{disorder}} is inherited as a unit character, or whether they result from <b>abnormalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> germ cell or chromosomes, conditioning mental disorders in the offspring which may present the same, or other clinical manifestations. iFeeble-mindedness, follows Mendelian law, and is due to <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> a single Mendelian factor. Most analyses {{that have been made}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feeble-minded have been scientifically insufficient; despite this, the results hold good. Mongolian imbecility, formerly asserted to be non-inheritable, was investigated by Herrman, who found that it usually revealed a neurotic condition in both parents. Brandeis found amaurotic family idiocy to be a simple Mendelian recessive. The epilepsies, are also inherited as a simple Mendelism defect (Weaks; Lundborg). Flood and Collins have provided at least partial conformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conclusion that both feeblemindedness and epilepsy are caused by the same defect. Dementia praecox, too, is a simple Mendelian recessive (Riedin; Cannon & Rosanoff; Rosanoff & Orr; Jolly & Witterman). Temperament was studied by the author, who concluded that it is probably a Mendelian dominant. The formulae for expressing the possibilities in <b>the</b> inheritance <b>of</b> different temperaments, and their combinations have been provided. Hunting's Chorea is inherited as a dominant disease. Criminality may be due to several causes and its inheritance will follow according to the cause and type. Consanguinity per se is not responsible for mental disorders; however, if both parents carry some recessive defect, the inherited taint will appear in at least one quarter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children.

40|$|Cells are not {{directly}} accessible in vivo and therefore their mechanical properties cannot be measured by methods that require a direct contact between probe and cell. Here, we introduce a novel in vivo assay based on particle tracking microrheology whereby the extent and time-lag dependence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mean squared displacements of thermally excited nanoparticles embedded within <b>the</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> <b>of</b> developing embryos reflect local viscoelastic properties. As a proof of principle, we probe local viscoelastic properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> <b>of</b> developing Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. Our results indicate that unlike differentiated cells, <b>the</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> <b>of</b> these embryos does not exhibit measurable elasticity, but is highly viscous.

40|$|Summary. Inherited platelet-based {{bleeding}} disorders include <b>abnormalities</b> <b>of</b> platelet {{number and}} function, and are generally classified {{based on the}} abnormal functions or responses. How-ever, a clear distinction is problematic, and in this review, the classification {{has been based on}} <b>abnormalities</b> <b>of</b> platelet com-ponents that share common characteristics. Inherited thrombocytopenias are rare, but probably under-diagnosed. They are usually classified according to both platelet size and {{the presence or absence of}} clinical features other than those deriving from the platelet defect. Hereditary disorders of platelet function can be classified as resulting from: (i) abnorm-alities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> platelet receptors for adhesive proteins; (ii) <b>abnormalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> platelet receptors for soluble agonists; (iii) <b>abnormalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> platelet granules; (iv) <b>abnormalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> signal-transduction pathways; (v) <b>abnormalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> membrane phospholipids; and (vi) miscellaneous <b>abnormalities</b> <b>of</b> platelet function. <b>The</b> literature on these disorders is re-viewed, and the underlying defects discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{automated}} {{interpretation of}} Pap smear images is a challenging issue with several aspects. <b>The</b> accurate segmenta-tion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structuring elements <b>of</b> each cell {{is a crucial}} procedure which entails in <b>the</b> correct identification <b>of</b> pathological situa-tions. However, the extended cell overlapping in Pap smear slides complicates <b>the</b> automated analysis <b>of</b> these cytological images. In this work, we propose an efficient algorithm for <b>the</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> area <b>of</b> overlapping cells. <b>The</b> proposed method {{is based on the}} fact that in isolated cells <b>the</b> pixels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> exhibit similar features and <b>the</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> area is homogeneous. Thus, <b>the</b> observation <b>of</b> intensity changes in extended subareas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> indicates <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> overlapping cells. In <b>the</b> first step <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed method, the image is tesselated into perceptually meaningful individual regions using a superpixel algorithm. In a second step, these areas are merged into regions exhibiting the same characteristics, resulting in <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> each <b>cytoplasm</b> area and <b>the</b> corresponding nuclei. <b>The</b> area <b>of</b> overlap is then detected using an algorithm that specifies faint changes in <b>the</b> intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> <b>of</b> each cell. <b>The</b> method has been evaluated on cytological images of conventional Pap smears, and the results are very promising.
