5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is not {{toxic to}} {{all forms of}} life. Its harmful effects are due to binding with hemoglobin so its danger to organisms that do not use this compound is doubtful. It thus {{has no effect on}} photosynthesising plants. It is easily absorbed through the lungs. Inhaling the gas can lead to hypoxic injury, nervous system damage, and even death. Different people and populations may have different carbon monoxide tolerance levels. On average, exposures at 100 ppm or greater is dangerous to human health. In the United States, the OSHA limits long-term workplace exposure levels to less than 50 ppm averaged over an 8-hour period; in addition, employees are to be removed from any confined space if an upper limit ("ceiling") of 100 ppm is reached. Carbon monoxide exposure may lead to a significantly shorter life span due to heart damage. The carbon monoxide tolerance level for any person is altered by several factors, including <b>activity</b> <b>level,</b> rate of ventilation, a pre-existing cerebral or cardiovascular disease, cardiac output, anemia, sickle cell disease and other hematological disorders, barometric pressure, and metabolic rate.|$|E

OBJECTIVES To describe the physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> in patients with chronic LBP, and to investigate whether physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> are associated with LBP related disability and pain intensity in them. METHODS This is a cross-sectional study with 36 patients with chronic LBP, both sexes, aged between 18 and 70 years. The main outcomes evaluated in this study were physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels,</b> LBP-related disability and pain intensity.

Mean pain intensity was 4. 81 (± 2. 72) points, while mean LBP-related disability was 13. 19 (± 6. 95). Physical activity and disability were negative and moderately correlated.

Outdoor playtime was also examined {{to contribute to the}} understanding of preschoolers 2 ̆ 7 <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> within this particular setting. Nine online databases were searched for peer-reviewed, English-language, primary studies that quantitatively measured physical and sedentary <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> of preschoolers attending home-based childcare. Studies were excluded if they were nonprimary research, if they lacked a preschool-aged sample, if they did not quantitatively measure physical or sedentary activity, or if they took place in an ineligible environment. Seven articles were included in this review; 3 had objective measures of <b>activity</b> <b>levels,</b> and 4 relied on nonobjective measures.

Physical activity can be objectively measured without distress using wrist actigraphy. The <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> during the wake periods of the day have been informative on psychopathology and antipsychotic medication. Several studies demonstrated prominent negative symptoms {{to be associated with}} reduced <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> with strongest correlations in chronic patients. Particularly, the avolition score is correlated with reduced <b>activity</b> <b>levels.</b> Moreover, <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> differ between DSM-IV schizophrenia spectrum disorders and subtypes as well as between patients treated with olanzapine or risperidone. The longitudinal course of <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> during an psychotic episode demonstrates considerable variance between subjects. During a psychotic episode patients with low <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> at baseline experience an amelioration of negative symptoms. In contrast, patients with high <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> at baseline have stable low negative syndrome scores. Between psychotic episodes less variance is observed.

With larger numbers of subjects in controlled trials, continuous recording of activity would foster the detection of different outcome trajectories, which may prove as useful groups to target interventions.

25|$|The {{physiological}} {{change from}} a state of deep sleep to wakefulness is reversible and mediated by the ARAS.

During sleep, neurons in the ARAS will have a much lower firing rate; conversely, {{they will have a}} higher <b>activity</b> <b>level</b> during the waking state. Therefore, low frequency inputs (during sleep) from the ARAS to the POA neurons result in an excitatory influence and higher activity levels (awake) will have inhibitory influence.

25|$|Heterozygous {{carriers}} (individuals who inherit one mutant allele) show abnormal {{enzyme activity}} but manifest no disease symptoms. This phenomenon is called dominance; the biochemical reason for wild-type alleles' dominance over nonfunctional mutant alleles in inborn errors of metabolism comes from how enzymes function. Enzymes are protein catalysts for chemical reactions; as catalysts, they speed up reactions without being used {{up in the}} process, so only small enzyme quantities are required {{to carry out a}} reaction. Someone homozygous for a nonfunctional mutation in the enzyme-encoding gene has little or no enzyme activity, so will manifest the abnormal phenotype. A heterozygote (heterozygous individual) has {{at least half of the}} normal enzyme <b>activity</b> <b>level,</b> due to expression of the wild-type allele.

Because neprilysin {{is thought to be}} the rate-limiting step in amyloid beta degradation, it has been considered a potential therapeutic target; compounds such as the peptide hormone somatostatin have been identified that increase the enzyme's <b>activity</b> <b>level.</b> One hypothesis for the strong dependence of Alzheimer's incidence on age focuses on the declining production of somatostatin in the brains of elderly people, which thus depresses the activity of neprilysin and promotes aggregation of unprocessed amyloid beta. Declining neprilysin activity with increasing age may also be explained by oxidative damage, known to be a causative factor in Alzheimer's disease; higher levels of inappropriately oxidized neprilysin have been found in Alzheimer's patients compared to cognitively normal elderly people.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Abundant {{literature}} {{supports the}} beneficial effects {{of physical activity}} for improving health of people with chronic diseases. The relationship between multimorbidity and physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels,</b> however, has been little evaluated. The {{purpose of the current}} exploratory {{study was to examine the}} relationship between a) multimorbidity and physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels,</b> and b) long-term limitations on activity, self-rated general health, psychological distress, and physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> for each sex in adults, after age, education, income, and employment factors were controlled for. Methods Data from the Quebec Health Survey 1998 were used. The sample included 16, 782 adults 18 – 69 yr of age. Independent variables were multimorbidity, long-term limitations on activity, self-rated general health, and psychological distress. The dependent variable was physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels.</b> Links between the independent and dependent variables were assessed separately for men and women with multinomial regressions while accounting for the survey sampling design and household clustering. Results About 46 % of the participants were men. Multimorbidity was not associated with physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> for either men or women. Men and women with long-term limitations on activity and with poor-to-average self-rated general health were less likely to be physically active. No relationship between psychological distress and physical activity was found for men. Women with high levels of psychological distress were less likely to be physically active. Conclusion Multimorbidity was not associated with physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> in either sex, when age, education, income, and employment factors were controlled for. Long-term limitations on activity and poor-to-average self-rated general health seem related to a reduction in physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> for both sexes, whereas psychological distress was associated with a reduction in physical <b>activity</b> <b>levels</b> only among women. Longitudinal studies using a comorbidity or multimorbidity index to account for severity of the chronic diseases are needed to replicate the results of this exploratory study. </p...|$|R
