The court also declined to issue an injunction against enforcement of the law, similarly to the district court in the case Roe v. Wade.

40|$|Optical mapping {{is a novel}} {{technique}} for generating the <b>restriction</b> map of <b>a</b> DNA molecule by observing many single, partially digested copies of it, using uorescence microscopy. The real-life problem is complicated by numerous factors: false positive and false negative cut observations, inaccurate location measurements, unknown orientations and faulty molecules. We present an algorithm for solving the real-life problem. The algorithm combines continuous optimization and combinatorial algorithms, applied to a non-uniform discretization of the data. We present encouraging results on real experimental data, and on simulated data. 1 Introduction Even {{in the era of}} whole genome methods, the mapping of restriction sites still {{plays an important role in}} genomic analysis and motivates further development of mapping procedures [4, 11].

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{examined how}} individuals respond to <b>a</b> <b>restriction</b> presented within <b>an</b> approach versus an avoidance frame. In Study 1, {{working on a}} problem-solving task, participants were initially free to choose their strategy, but for a second task were told to change their strategy. The message to change was embedded in either an approach or avoidance frame. When confronted with an avoidance compared to an approach frame, the participants’ reactance toward the request was greater and, in turn, led to impaired performance. The role of reactance {{as a response to}} threat to freedom was explicitly examined in Study 2, in which participants evaluated a potential change in policy affecting their program of study herein explicitly varying whether <b>a</b> <b>restriction</b> was present or absent and whether the message was embedded in an approach versus avoidance frame. When communicated with an avoidance frame and as <b>a</b> <b>restriction,</b> participants showed the highest resistance in terms of reactance, message agreement and evaluation of the communicator. The difference in agreement with the change was mediated by reactance only when <b>a</b> <b>restriction</b> was present. Overall, avoidance goal frames were associated with more resistance to change on different levels of experience (reactance, performance, person perception). Reactance mediated the effect of goal frame on other outcomes only when <b>a</b> <b>restriction</b> was present...|$|R
