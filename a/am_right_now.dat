In an interview after Ocean's open letter, Malay called him [...] "the new hybrid of what an MC {{used to be in}} the '80s or '90s ... the true storyteller" [...] and said of the lyrics, [...] "I don't think anyone during any given point during the creative process knew what was happening ... when he's singing maybe from a female perspective or whatever, it's a story, it's a world that he created. It's not necessarily his personal—like something that he's experiencing. Maybe it is and it's a metaphor the way he did it". They finished writing Channel Orange in two to three months. Ocean said of the album's development in an interview for Rap-Up, [...] "It succinctly defines me as an artist for where I <b>am</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> and that was the aim. It's about the stories. If I write 14 stories that I love, then the next step is to get the environment of music around it to best envelop the story and all kinds of sonic goodness." ...|$|E
500|$|Milian wrote So Amazin {{based on}} her own life, and each record pertained to a {{different}} aspect, especially focused on relationships. During early production of the album, Milian was dealing with her break-up with actor Nick Cannon and wrote several records based on that. While writing the mid-tempo track [...] "My Lovin' Goes", Milian felt she turned a new leaf. She said, [...] "you see the change in So Amazin where life was just really coming into place. I was finally becoming the woman that I feel that I <b>am</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> Also, I was leaving old love behind and learning about new types of love. Which is great, whether it be life, and also the dating scene is really nice." [...] Two tracks which Milian wrote about Cannon were [...] "Gonna Tell Everybody" [...] and [...] "Who's Gonna Ride". When Milian and Cool & Dre had discussions, her break-up with Cannon was regularly mentioned. Milian felt a need to express herself, and writing became therapeutic for Milian; {{she was able to}} get through the break-up by writing songs. The production by Cool & Dre also inspired Milian to write the tracks, as she felt comfortable with them and was able to be open.|$|E

2500|$|The single [...] "Cannonball" [...] {{was written}} by Sia Furler.

Michele has stated, [...] "I just felt that [...] "Cannonball" [...] was the perfect first song for people to hear from this record.

It's really been so helpful for me and I hope it's the same for other people as it's been for me." [...] Because of this, Furler gave the song to her.
