25|$|Cases of {{stigmatism}} {{fall into}} two categories: self-inflicted wounds, which may be either cases of fraud or of unconscious self-infliction, {{and those that are}} caused by emotional states... Self-induced (through <b>autosuggestion)</b> itching and subsequent scratching of which the individual is unaware is likely to occur in suggestible persons if the stimulus is a mental or actual picture of the Crucifixion used during meditation and if the main motive is to receive the stigmata. The motive behind that may be unconscious conflict and a desire to escape from an intolerable situation into invalidism where one's needs are taken care of. It then becomes a case of hysterical conversion reaction. Many cases of stigmatism can be explained as fraud or unconsciously self-inflicted wounds.|$|E

40|$|In the {{internet}} era, {{the information that}} can be found about politicians online can influence events such as the results of elections. Research has shown that biased search rankings can shift the voting preferences of undecided voters. This shows the importance of studying online search behaviour, especially in the pre-elections phase, when search results can have a particular influence on the future political scene of a country. This master thesis aimed to study the behaviour of online search engines in a period before the German federal election in 2017. The aim was to ascertain if there is any pattern {{to be found in the}} auto-suggestions for searches related to politicians. In order to gather data for this experiment, a crawler browsed search engine web pages, input a name and a surname of a politician, and saved that together with all <b>autosuggestions</b> from the search engine. The <b>autosuggestions</b> were prepared for the analysis and divided into semantic groups with the help of clustering algorithms. Different statistical methods, such as correlation analysis, regression analysis, and clustering were used to identify patterns in the data. The research showed that there are no particularly strong patterns in the <b>autosuggestions</b> for searches related to politician’s names. Only moderate dependence was found between gender and personal topics, and showed that a higher amount of personal information <b>autosuggestions</b> correspond more to female politicians...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Magico – {{religious}} rites in treating {{physical and mental}} ailments once widespread in ancient India are still prevalent among the tribals / primitive societies. This study shows that {{it is based on}} a scientifically sound psychological approach. Magical incantation and other {{religious rites}} performed to cure the disease unknowingly affect the mind of patient who in turn subjected to have <b>autosuggestions</b> of getting cured. This generates a kind of psychic energy in him which then helps him to regain the natural capacity of the body to recover from the ailments. Traditional Medicine of the Tribals of India although based on herbalism, is largely depended on incantation of magical verses and sacrificial rites. The magico religious practice in treating physical and mental ailments were widespread in the prehistoric India especially during the Atharvavedic period. Atharvaveda declares “There are hundreds of medical practitioners an...|$|R

50|$|Autogenic {{training}} is an <b>autosuggestion</b> based relaxation technique {{influenced by the}} Coué method. In 1932, German psychiatrist Johannes Schultz developed and published on autogenic training. Unlike <b>autosuggestion,</b> autogenic training has been proven in clinical trials and, along with other relaxation techniques, such as progressive relaxation and meditation, has replaced <b>autosuggestion</b> in therapy. The co-author of Schultz's multi-volume tome on autogenic training, Wolfgang Luthe, was a firm believer that autogenic training was a powerful approach that should only be offered to patients by qualified professionals. Its effectiveness has been confirmed in several studies.|$|E

50|$|<b>Autosuggestion</b> is a {{psychological}} technique {{related to the}} placebo effect, developed by apothecary Émile Coué {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century.

50|$|Self-hypnosis {{happens when}} a person hypnotises oneself, {{commonly}} involving the use of <b>autosuggestion.</b> The technique {{is often used to}} increase motivation for a diet, to quit smoking, or to reduce stress.

50|$|The use of <b>autosuggestion</b> is {{intended}} to complement use of medicine, but no medication of Coué's time could save a patient from depression or tension.

Conversely, he contended, patients who are skeptical of a medicine would find it least effective.|$|E

5000|$|Emile Coué (1857-1926), a French {{pharmacist}} — and, {{according to}} Charles Baudouin, {{the founder of}} the [...] "New Nancy School" [...] — having studied with Liébeault in 1885 and 1886, discarded the 'hypnosis' of Bernheim and Liébeault (c.1886), adopted the 'hypnotism' of Braid (c.1901), and created {{what became known as the}} Coué method (la méthode Coué), centred on the promotion of conscious <b>autosuggestion.</b> His method was an ordered sequence of rational, systematic, intricately constructed, subject-centred hypnotherapeutic interactions that stressed the significance of both unconscious and conscious <b>autosuggestion,</b> delivered a collection of well-polished common-sense explanations, a persuasive set of experiential exercises, a powerfully efficacious hypnotism-centred ego-strengthening intervention and, finally, detailed instruction in the specific ritual through which his empirically determined formula “Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better” was to be self-administered twice daily. Much of the work of early 20th century self-help teachers (such as such as Norman Vincent Peale, Robert H. Schuller, and W. Clement Stone) was derived from that of Coué.|$|E
