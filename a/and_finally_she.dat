5|$|In 1936, Romanian {{physicist}} Horia Hulubei and his French colleague Yvette Cauchois also analyzed pollucite, {{this time}} using their high-resolution X-ray apparatus. They observed several weak emission lines, which they {{presumed to be}} those of element 87. Hulubei and Cauchois reported their discovery and proposed the name moldavium, along with the symbol Ml, after Moldavia, the Romanian province where Hulubei was born. In 1937, Hulubei's work was criticized by American physicist F. H. Hirsh Jr., who rejected Hulubei's research methods. Hirsh was certain that eka-caesium would not be found in nature, and that Hulubei had instead observed mercury or bismuth X-ray lines. Hulubei insisted that his X-ray apparatus and methods were too accurate {{to make such a}} mistake. Because of this, Jean Baptiste Perrin, Nobel Prize winner and Hulubei's mentor, endorsed moldavium as the true eka-caesium over Marguerite Perey's recently discovered francium. Perey took pains to be accurate and detailed in her criticism of Hulubei's work, <b>and</b> <b>finally</b> <b>she</b> was credited as the sole discoverer of element 87. All other previous purported discoveries of element 87 were ruled out due to francium's very limited half-life.|$|E
500|$|Parallel Lines: Media Representations of Dance (1993) {{observed}} that in Rhythm Nation 1814, Jackson represents a [...] "modern good fairy" [...] attempting to guide troubled youth {{to a more}} positive way of life. Each of the three segments serve a different purpose, beginning with affinity and companionship in [...] "Miss You Much", followed by anger and frustration in her rooftop solo and ending with [...] "Rhythm Nation", in which Jackson and her dancers [...] "have become a uniformed, formidable army, whose controlled energetic moves and shouts project a disciplined resolution to inspire others through dance and music." [...] Their group dynamic visually depicts a gender neutral equality, with Jackson [...] "performing asexually and anonymously in front of, but {{as one of the}} members of the group." [...] It is also noted that the success of the film is not only the final product, but in the commercial and social implications of its development. In selecting an unknown street dancer, Anthony Thomas, to develop her choreography, [...] "Janet Jackson secures a threefold achievement: she satisfies the dictates of the commercial pop music industry by creating a dance image which is significantly different from her earlier work; she demonstrates that, despite fame, she is still in touch with contemporary youth pop culture and its fashions; <b>and</b> <b>finally,</b> <b>she</b> , not the dance traditions of Hollywood musical... but the work of a young black man whose training is outside the institutions of Western theatre and clearly an Afro-American cultural expression of the late 1980s." [...] The film received positive reception. Jefferson Graham in USA Today commented that [...] "she dances up a storm in the moody black-and-white video's three songs... and plays the role of a mystical figure to young kids." [...] Jon Pareles remarked that [...] " [...] juxtaposes her dance routines with grim urban imagery and a plot line about drugs versus dreams." [...] It was later released on VHS as the Rhythm Nation 1814 Compilation, and reissued the following year with each of the album's promotional music videos. Jackson received two MTV Music Video Award nominations for [...] "Best Dance Video" [...] and [...] "Best Choreography" [...] for [...] "Rhythm Nation", winning the latter.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the middle}} of {{political}} disorders of the late 18th century, Norwich intellectual life flourished. It contained one, so far unmentioned characteristic: Harriet Martineau wrote of the city's literati of the period, which included such people as William Taylor, {{one of the first}} German scholars in England. The city [...] "boasted of her intellectual supper-parties, where, amidst a pedantry which would now make laughter hold both his sides, there was much that was pleasant and salutary: <b>and</b> <b>finally</b> <b>she</b> called herself The Athens of England." ...|$|E

On August 11, 2011, Jane takes the blame for stabbing David so Erica can remain free. During the last few episodes of the show Erica is offered a chance to write a movie about her book (much {{to the dismay of}} Jack who wants to marry her). This leads to a fallout between the two at Stuart Chandler's welcome home party. As Jack leaves the party, Erica admits in front of everyone that she needs and loves Jack, to which he replies by bitterly telling her, Rhett Butler-style, that [...] "frankly," [...] he doesn't give a damn about what she needs. [...] "This is not the ending I wanted," [...] Erica says to Opal. [...] "Oh, you've done it, now you'll never get it back," [...] Opal tells her. [...] "Just watch me," [...] says Erica. As Erica goes after Jack, JR fires his pistol, ending the show. It is implied that the bullet has hit Erica as she is last to be shown before the screen blacks out.|$|E
