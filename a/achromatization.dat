40|$|Achromatic coronagraphs are {{the subject}} of {{intensive}} research since they will be mandatory for many programs which aim at detecting and characterizing exoplanets. We report a laboratory experiment assessing the performance of the Four-Quadrant Phase-Mask coronagraph (FQPM) over a broadband wavelength range (R≈ 2). The <b>achromatization</b> of the FQPM is provided by achromatic halfwave plates (HWP). These phase shifters combine birefringent plates made of different materials with properly chosen thicknesses. The HWP thickness control is relaxed by two orders of magnitudes with respect to the classical (non-birefringent) dispersive plate approach. In our experiment we used a two stage stack of Quartz and MgF_ 2. This combination allows to cover a large spectral range in the visible (500 - 900 nm) with a small phase error residual around π(≈ 0. 12 rad rms). With this <b>achromatization,</b> we obtained an attenuation of 755 on the white light PSF peak. This solution is directly applicable to ground-based telescopes using high order adaptive optics such as the ESO's VLT-Planet Finder project and could easily be transposed in the mid-infrared domain for future space-based missions like DARWIN/TPF...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A simple {{achromatic}} retarder made of two {{plates of}} different birefringent materials {{can only be}} used over a limited range of wavelengths. One way to overcome this limitation is by {{using a combination of}} three such achromatic retarders. However, such a combination has the drawback that the orientation of its principal axis varies with the wavelength. An alternative method that is free from this drawback is to use a combination of three plates of different birefringent materials. This paper shows how this method of <b>achromatization</b> can be extended and presents a systematic design procedure for a superachromatic retarder using four plates of different birefringent materials giving an almost constant retardation over a very wide wavelength range...|$|E
40|$|The optical {{modulator}} {{on the base}} of a ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) is considered. The single-component FLC with the smectic chiral phase existance in the range from 22 up to 45 °C was used in the modulator. The cell with the gyrotropy angle equal to 90 was obtained. The measurements of the optical transmission dependences on the control voltage range were realized. The cell is completely achromatic for the linear polarized light. The modulator advantages include the capabilities to obtain the complete <b>achromatization</b> of the electric-optical effect, to realize the wavequide regime and to achieve the modulation depth equal to 0. 85 and the switching time of 80 μs at the control electric field intensity of about 0. 05 v/μm...|$|E
40|$|The linear {{chromatic}} aberration (LCA) of several combinations of polycarbonates (PCs) and poly (methyl methacrylates) (PMMAs) as singlet, hybrid (refractive/diffractive) lenses and doublets operating with wavelengths between 380 and 1600 nm – corresponding to a typical zone of interest of concentrated photovoltaics (CPV) – are compared. Those comparisons {{show that the}} maximum theoretical concentration factor for singlets is limited to about 1000 × at normal incidence and that hybrid lenses and refractive doublets present a smaller LCA increasing the concentration factor up to 5000 × and 2 × 106 respectively. A new <b>achromatization</b> equation more useful than the Abbé equation is also presented. Finally we determined the ideal position of the focal point {{as a function of}} the LCA and the geometric concentration which maximizes the flux on the solar cell. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Space-borne nulling interferometers {{have long}} been {{considered}} as the best option for searching and characterizing extra-solar planets located in the habitable zone of their parent stars. Solutions for achieving deep starlight extinction are now numerous and well demonstrated. However they essentially aim at realizing an achromatic central null in order to extinguish the star. In this communication is described a major improvement of the technique, where the <b>achromatization</b> process is extended to the entire fringe pattern. Therefore higher Signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and appreciable simplification of the detection system should result. The basic principle of this Fully achromatic nulling interferometer (FANI) consists in inserting dispersive elements along {{the arms of the}} interferometer. Herein this principle is explained and illustrated by a preliminary optical system design.

40|$|Astronomical spectropolarimeters can {{be subject}} to many sources of {{systematic}} error which limit the precision and accuracy of the instrument. We present a calibration method for observing high-resolution polarized spectra using chromatic liquid-crystal variable retarders (LCVRs). These LCVRs allow for polarimetric modulation of the incident light without any moving optics at frequencies > 10 Hz. We demonstrate a calibration method using pure Stokes input states that enables an <b>achromatization</b> of the system. This Stokes-based deprojection method reproduces input polarization even though highly chromatic instrument effects exist. This process is first demonstrated in a laboratory spectropolarimeter where we characterize the LCVRs and show example deprojections. The process is then implemented the a newly upgraded HiVIS spectropolarimeter on the 3. 67 m AEOS telescope. The HiVIS spectropolarimeter has also been expanded to include broad-band full-Stokes spectropolarimetry using achromatic wave-plates {{in addition to the}} tunable full-Stokes polarimetric mode using LCVRs. These two new polarimetric modes in combination with a new polarimetric calibration unit provide a much more sensitive polarimetric package with greatly reduced systematic error.

40|$|The AGPM (Annular Groove Phase Mask, Mawet et al. 2005) is {{an optical}} {{vectorial}} vortex coronagraph (or vector vortex) synthesized by a circular subwavelength grating, {{that is a}} grating with a period smaller than λ/n (λ being the observed wavelength and n the refractive index of the grating substrate). Since it is a phase mask, it allows to reach a high contrast with a small working angle. Moreover, its subwavelength structure provides a good <b>achromatization</b> over wide spectral bands. Recently, we have manufactured and measured our first N-band prototypes that allowed us to validate the reproducibility of the microfabrication process. Here, we present newly produced mid-IR diamond AGPMs in the N-band (~ 10 µm), and in the most wanted L-band (~ 3. 5 µm). We first give an extrapolation of the expected coronagraph performances. We then present the manufacturing and measurement results, using diamond-optimized microfabrication techniques such as nano-imprint lithography (NIL) and reactive ion etching (RIE).

40|$|A {{renewal of}} {{interest}} into Lyot coronagraphy began about 10 {{years ago with}} the advent of the new and very demanding goal of detecting directly extrasolar planets. Among the new ideas, the Four Quadrant Phase Mask (4 QPMC) has been rather prolific. The 4 QPM coronagraph is based the peculiar design of binary phase mask (0,π 0,π) dividing the full field of view at the focal plane in four quadrants. The mutual destructive interferences of the coherent light of a source perfectly centered on the mask, produce a total nulling within the pupil image, as is demonstrated analytically. We first recall the concept and performance of the 4 QPMC. We then analyse the different limitations in space or ground-based observations from simulations. We then address the issue of device manufacturing and give the status of the actual performance in laboratory. A section reviews the various instruments under development that are equipped with this component. We conclude with a panorama of the rest of the family of the 4 QPMC, which comprises several variants proposed by different teams. More specifically we address the important question of the <b>achromatization</b> by describing the various ideas which are currently explored to solve this problem.

40|$|In recent years, phase mask coronagraphy {{has become}} {{increasingly}} efficient in imaging the close environment of stars, enabling the search for exoplanets and circumstellar disks. Coronagraphs are ideally suited instruments, characterized by high dynamic range imaging capabilities, while preserving a small inner working angle. The AGPM (Annular Groove Phase Mask, Mawet et al. 2005) consists of a vector vortex induced by a rotationally symmetric subwavelength grating. This technique constitutes an almost unique solution to the <b>achromatization</b> at longer wavelengths (mid-infrared). For this reason, we have specially conceived a mid-infrared AGPM coronagraph for the forthcoming upgrade of VISIR, the mid-IR imager and spectrograph on the VLT at ESO (Paranal), in collaboration {{with members of the}} VISIR consortium. The implementation phase of the VISIR Upgrade Project is foreseen for May-August 2012, and the AGPM installed will cover the 11 - 13. 2 μm spectral range. In this paper, we present the entire fabrication process of our AGPM imprinted on a diamond substrate. Diamond is an ideal material for mid-infrared wavelengths owing to its high transparency, small dispersion, extremely low thermal expansion and outstanding mechanical and chemical properties. The design process has been performed with an algorithm based on the rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA), and the micro-fabrication has been carried out using nano-imprint lithography and reactive ion etching. A precise grating profile metrology has also been conducted using cleaving techniques. Finally, we show the deposit of fiducials (i. e. centering marks) with Aerosol Jet Printing (AJP).

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{performance}} of a vector apodizing phase plate coronagraph that operates over a wavelength range of 2 - 5 mu m. and is installed in MagAO/Clio 2 at the 6. 5 m Magellan Clay telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile. The coronagraph manipulates the phase in the pupil to produce three beams yielding two coronagraphic point-spread functions (PSFs) and one faint leakage PSF. The phase pattern is imposed through the inherently achromatic geometric phase, enabled by liquid crystal technology and polarization techniques. The coronagraphic optic is manufactured using a direct-write technique for precise control of the liquid crystal pattern. and multitwist retarders for <b>achromatization.</b> By integrating a linear phase ramp to the coronagraphic phase pattern, two separated coronagraphic PSFs are created with a single pupil-plane optic, which makes it robust and easy to install in existing telescopes. The two coronagraphic PSFs contain a 180 degrees dark hole on each side of a star, and these complementary copies of the star are used to correct the seeing halo close to the star. To characterize the coronagraph, we collected a data set of a bright (m(L) = 0 - 1) nearby star with similar to 1. 5 hr of observing time. By rotating and optimally scaling one PSF. and subtracting it from the other PSF, we see a contrast improvement by 1. 46 magnitudes at 3. 5 lambda/D. With regular angular differential imaging at 3. 9 mu m, the MagAO vector apodizing phase plate coronagraph delivers a 5 sigma Delta mag contrast of 8. 3 (= 10 (- 3. 3)) at 2 lambda/D and 12. 2 (= 10 (- 4. 8)) at 3. 5 lambda/D...|$|E
40|$|International audienceContext. For direct imaging of exoplanets, {{a stellar}} {{coronagraph}} helps {{to remove the}} image of an observed bright star by attenuating the diffraction effects caused by the telescope aperture of diameter D. The dual zone phase mask (DZPM) coronagraph constitutes a promising concept since it theoretically offers a small inner working angle (IWA similar to lambda(0) /D where lambda(0) denotes the central wavelength of the spectral range Delta lambda), good achromaticity, and high starlight rejection, typically reaching a 10 (6) contrast at 5 lambda(0) /D from the star over a spectral bandwidth Delta lambda/lambda(0) of 25 % (similar to H-band). This last value proves to be encouraging for broadband imaging of young and warm Jupiter-like planets. Aims. Contrast levels higher than 10 (6) are, however, required for observing older and/or less massive companions over a finite spectral bandwidth. An <b>achromatization</b> improvement of the DZPM coronagraph is therefore mandatory to reach such good performance. Methods. In its design, the DZPM coronagraph uses a gray (or achromatic) apodization. We replaced it by a colored apodization to increase the performance of this coronagraphic system over a wide spectral range. This innovative concept, called colored apodizer phase mask (CAPM) coronagraph, is defined to reach the highest contrast in the exoplanet search area. Once this has been done, we study the performance of the CAPM coronagraph in the presence of different errors to evaluate the sensitivity of our concept. Results. A 2. 5 mag contrast gain is estimated from the performance provided by the CAPM coronagraph with respect to that of the DZPM coronagraph. A 2. 2 x 10 (- 8) intensity level at 5 lambda(0) /D separation is then theoretically achieved with the CAPM coronagraph {{in the presence of a}} clear circular aperture and a 25 % bandwidth. In addition, our studies show that our concept is less sensitive to low than to high-order aberrations for a given value of rms wavefront errors...|$|E
40|$|Context. Direct {{detection}} {{of a planet}} around a star and its characterization for identification of bio-tracers in the mid-IR, requires a nulling interferometer. Such an instrument must be efficient in a large wavelength domain {{in order to have}} the capability to detect simultaneously the infrared spectral features of several bio-tracers: CO 2, O 3 and H 2 O. Aims. A broad wavelength range can be effective, provided that an achromatic phase shift ofπcan be implemented, with an accuracy good enough for achieving a deep nulling at all considered wavelengths. A new concept for designing such an achromatic phase shifter is presented here. The major interest of this solution is that it allows a simple design, with essentially one device per beam. Methods. The heart of the system consists in two cellular mirrors where each cell has a thickness which introduces, for a given central wavelength, a phase shift of (2 k+ 1) π or of 2 kπ on the fraction of the wave it reflects. Each mirror is put in one of the collimated beams of the interferometer. Because of the odd/even distribution, a destructive interference is produced on axis for the central wavelength when recombining the two beams. Now, if the number of cells of a given thickness follows a rather simple law, based on the Pascal’s triangle, then we show that the nulling is also efficient for a wavelength not too far from the central wavelength. Results. The effect of <b>achromatization</b> is the more efficient the larger the number of cells is. For instance, with two mirrors of 64 × 64 cells, where the cells phase shift ranges between- 6 π and+ 6 π, one reaches a nulling of 10 − 6 on a wavelength range [0. 6 λ 0, 1. 25 λ 0], i. e. on more than one complete octave. This is why we claim that this device produces a quasi-achromatic phase shift: especially, i...|$|E
