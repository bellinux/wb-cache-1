25|$|In the {{symmetric}} TSP, {{the distance}} between two cities is the same in each opposite direction, forming an undirected graph. This symmetry halves the number of possible solutions. In the asymmetric TSP, paths may not exist in both directions or the distances might be different, forming a directed graph. Traffic collisions, one-way streets, and airfares for cities with different departure and <b>arrival</b> <b>fees</b> are examples of how this symmetry could break down.|$|E

50|$|Before the beurtvaart merchants {{had to hire}} {{an entire}} ship if they wanted {{something}} transported, although middlemen like shipbrokers probably saw to some break bulk cargo as well. From {{the end of the}} 15th century wealth and trade were growing in the Netherlands, pushing the demand for transportation. Meanwhile, the cities increasingly involved themselves in regulating the transport business, primarily to advance their own skippers at the expense of those from other places. For instance, the right of lastbreken meant that a shipment of goods had to be unloaded upon <b>arrival,</b> involving <b>fees</b> for porters, warehouses and such. The medieval staple right is another example. As competing skippers would regularly get involved in fistfights over rights, shipments and times to load and sail, the cities made more and more rules and regulations.|$|R

50|$|In May 2014, the Department of Homeland Security {{published}} an interim final rule regarding {{the issuance of}} ABTCs to U.S. citizens. Applicants for ABTCs must already be enrolled in Global Entry, NEXUS, or SENTRI. As the United States is only a transitional member of the ABTC scheme and does not grant any visa waiver to ABTC holders from other economies, U.S. citizens reciprocally do not enjoy any additional visa-free travel through the ABTC scheme. However, they qualify for expedited visa appointment procedures for those economies which require visas for U.S. citizens, and use of diplomatic or crew lines at airports. Among the 21 ABTC scheme member economies, mainland China, Russia, and Vietnam require advance visas for U.S. citizens making short-term business visits, Papua New Guinea issue visas on <b>arrival</b> for a <b>fee.</b>|$|R
40|$|Resource {{management}} {{is important for}} network design and deployment. Resource management and allocation have been studied under {{a wide variety of}} scenarios [...] - routing in wired networks, scheduling in cellular networks, multiplexing, switching, and channel access in opportunistic networks are but a few examples. In this dissertation, we revisit resource management in the context of routing and scheduling in multihop wireless networks and pricing in single resource systems. The first issue addressed is of delays in multihop wireless networks. The resource under contention is capacity which is allocated by a joint routing and scheduling algorithm. Delay in wireless networks is a key issue gaining interest with the growth of interactive applications and proliferation of wireless networks. We start with an investigation of the back-pressure algorithm (BPA), an algorithm that activates the schedule with the largest sum of link weights in a timeslot. Though the BPA is throughput-optimal, it has poor end-to-end delays. Our investigation identifies poor routing decisions at low loads as one cause for it. We improve the delay performance of max-weight algorithms by proposing a general framework for routing and scheduling algorithms that allow directing packets towards the sink node dynamically. For a stationary environment, we explicitly formulate delay minimization as a static problem while maintaining stability. We see similar improved delay performance with the advantage of reduced per time-slot complexity. Next, the issue of pricing for flow based models is studied. The increasing popularity of cloud computing and the ease of commerce over the Internet is making pricing a key issue requiring greater attention. Although pricing has been extensively studied in the context of maximizing revenue and fairness, we take a different perspective and investigate pricing with predictability. Prior work has studied resource allocations that link insensitivity and predictability. In this dissertation, we present a detailed analysis of pricing under insensitive allocations. We study three common pricing models [...] - fixed rate pricing, Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auctions, and congestion-based pricing, and provide the expected operator revenue and user payments under them. A pre-payment scheme is also proposed where users pay on <b>arrival</b> a <b>fee</b> for their estimated service costs. Such a mechanism is shown to have lower variability in payments under fixed rate pricing and VCG auctions while generating the same long-term revenue as in a post-payment scheme, where users pay the exact charge accrued during their sojourn. Our formulation and techniques further the understanding of pricing mechanisms and decision-making for the operator...|$|R
40|$|Within the UK, higher {{education}} is increasingly becoming more competitive, particularly with the <b>arrival</b> of increased <b>fees</b> from 2012. As a result, {{over the past few}} years the University of Chester has ran programmes in other countries including Dublin and Mumbai to raise its research profile and meet the needs of the market. Students on these distance learner programmes have the same rights with regards to online library resources as those studying at Chester. One of the main problems that has arisen from this has been how to induct the students and show them the wealth of online library resources available to them. The presentation will focus on an initiative at the University of Chester that looked at developing a new approach to inducting students at a distance. In September 2011, the Applied Sciences and Social Science library subject team at the University created a resource pack for students on distance learner programmes in other countries with an aim to improve the student experience during induction. The resources pack consisted of an interactive tutorial DVD and a resource CD containing information on how to access the library resources the students would need for their course. This pack replaced previous methods of induction such as printed hand-outs and workbooks. It was hoped it would be a more personable and accessible method of inducting the students into the library at a distance. The presentation will examine the rationale behind creating the resource pack and will look at the benefits and challenges involved in creating the content including compatibility issues with the format of the DVD. It will consider the feedback received from students regarding the resources pack and areas for potentially developing the project in the future...|$|R
