5|$|The modern {{scientific}} study of yoga began with the works of N. C. Paul and Major D.

5|$|The two men {{credited}} {{with the birth of}} forecasting <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>science</b> were officer of the Royal Navy Francis Beaufort and his protégé Robert FitzRoy.

40|$|A vast body of {{research}} has shown information <b>science</b> to be <b>a</b> social <b>science,</b> but information <b>science’s</b> identity <b>as</b> both <b>a</b> social <b>science</b> and <b>a</b> non-social <b>science</b> has become all the more uncertain, or simply has been left to {{the discretion of the}} reader. Method. This paper traces the specifics of information <b>science</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> social <b>science.</b> The paper examines the background of the social sciences in the history of academic disciplines. The paper discusses the ways in which positivism and interpretativism, the leading traditions of the social sciences, assert themselves in information <b>science</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> social <b>science.</b> Conclusions. It is argued that received ideas about the social sciences impact how information <b>science</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> social <b>science</b> is perceived. It is also argued that information <b>science</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> social <b>science</b> can and should provide valid scientific explanations. This paper distinguishes social interaction as the defining feature of information <b>science</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> social <b>science.</b> To this end, the paper proposes global complexity not <b>as</b> <b>a</b> theory or solution, but <b>as</b> <b>a</b> metaphor for information <b>science</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> social <b>science</b> to address the pressing issues of our increasingly interconnected world...|$|R

5|$|Espejo {{particularly}} {{criticized the}} Jesuits for, among other things, teaching ethics not <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>science</b> {{but as a}} guide to good manners and for their adoption of Probabilism as a moral guide. He complained about the lax system for educating priests in Quito and said it instilled slothful habits in students. As a result, the priests had no real idea of their duties towards society and God and had little inclination to study. In El Nuevo Luciano de Quito, he lamented the large number of quacks who pretended to be doctors. In La ciencia blancardina he continued his attack on these quacks while attacking clerics who worked as physicians without adequate medical education.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{psychiatry}} explores philosophical questions relating to psychiatry and mental illness.

The second entails the examination of the concepts employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the normative questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the philosophy of mind and psychopathology.|$|E
