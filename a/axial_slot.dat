50|$|A {{crossbow}} is a bow {{mounted on}} a stick (called a tiller or stock) with a mechanism in it that holds the drawn bow string. The earliest designs featured a slot in the stock, down into which the string was placed. To shoot this design, a vertical rod is thrust up {{through a hole in}} the bottom of the notch, forcing the string out. This rod is usually attached perpendicular to a rear-facing lever called a trigger or tickler. A later design implemented a rolling cylindrical pawl called a nut to retain the string. This nut has a perpendicular centre slot for the bolt, and an intersecting <b>axial</b> <b>slot</b> for the string, along with a lower face or slot against which the internal trigger sits. They often also have some form of strengthening internal sear or trigger face, usually of metal. These roller nuts were either free-floating in their close-fitting hole across the stock, tied in with a binding of sinew or other strong cording; or {{mounted on a}} metal axle or pins. Removable or integral plates of wood, ivory, or metal on the sides of the stock kept the nut in place laterally. Nuts were made of antler, bone, or metal. Bows could be kept taut and ready to shoot for some time with little effort, allowing crossbowmen to aim better.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} shown in many cases that a notable {{aerodynamic}} stability enhancement can be achieved using casing treatments (CTs) on transonic compressors. This advantage, however, often involves degradation in efficiency at design point conditions. In order to analyze the correlations between efficiency, surge margin and other flow quantities {{on the one hand and}} the geometric parameters related to <b>axial</b> <b>slots</b> on the other, an automated multi objective geometry optimization of <b>axial</b> <b>slots</b> is performed. This involves the usage of time accurate URANS simulations for each new CT design the optimization tool proposes. The <b>axial</b> <b>slots</b> are generated using a parametric design, which can produce slots of different size, shape and position. Three operating points are simulated. One at design point (ADP) conditions, a second at reduced speed working line conditions and a third at reduced speed close to the stability limit. Based on the results of the CFD simulations two objective values are calculated. These are, first, an increased efficiency at working line conditions and, second, an increased surge margin at reduced speed. The test case used for the study is the first stage of DLR’s transonic research compressor Rig 250. The rig is representative for the front stages of a heavy duty gasturbine compressor. The computational domain includes the IGV as well as the first rotor and stator. The rotor of the configuration is tip-critical for the studied part speed condition. The result of the optimization is a Pareto front with all optimal geometries regarding surge margin and efficiency. It is found that efficiency at design point can be exchanged against surge margin at reduced speed. The working principles and flow phenomena of the Pareto-optimal <b>axial</b> <b>slots</b> are analyzed in detail to obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to the extension in surge margin...|$|R

In the lit-Antennas and Multiple erature, numerous stud-Input Multiple Output ies have previously exam-(MIMO) systems ined the field characteristics from such structures. Investigations about the radiated field when two axial slots of arbitrary size and position exist are yet not considered. A method was explained for determining the radiation patterns of an <b>axial</b> <b>slot</b> antenna {{on the surface of}} a metallic circular cylinder (Sinclair, 1948 [7]). For a slot of arbitrary shape an expression was derived for the external generated field. The far field was obtained by applying the method of steepest decent to the Fourier integrals in the solution (Silver and Saunders, 1950 [6]). Also, the radiation patterns of an <b>axial</b> <b>slot</b> in a dielectric coated circular cylinder were obtained with several comparisons to experimental results (Hurd, 1956 [3]). In addition, the fields produced by an arbitrary slot on a circular cylinder with a cocentric dielectric coating were reached.

The unsteady simulations are performed with a three-dimensional time accurate Favre-averaged Navier-stokes flow solver. In order to resolve all important flow mechanisms appearing through the use of casing treatments, a computational multiblock grid consisting of approximately 2. 4 million nodes was used for the simulations. The configurations include <b>axial</b> <b>slots</b> in 4 different variations with an axial extension ranging into the blade passage of the IGV. Their shape is semicircular with no inclination in circumferential direction. The simulations proved the effectiveness of casing treatments with an upstream stator.

40|$|Abstract. A new {{ultrasonic}} {{method for}} evaluating axial flaw depth in pipes is proposed with circumferential shear vertical, SV, wave. When a conventional {{ultrasonic flaw detection}} technique with pipe transducers is applied to sizing of inner axial flaws in pipes, the wave amplitude reflected at the axial flaw or that transmitted through the flaw is not proportional to the flaw depth. Moreover, the received amplitude of the flaw depends on circumferential position. The {{reason is that the}} shear wave beams in the pipe are not parallel, e. g., the refraction angle into steel pipes varies with the circumference position. To improve this, a special shear wave transducer of equi-refraction angle was designed. With this transducer, the wave energy distribution along the wall thickness is nearly uniform, therefore, the transmitted wave amplitude through the flaw is expected to be proportional to the flaw depth. To confirm this, we measured the wave amplitude transmitted through an <b>axial</b> <b>slot</b> in a pipe of thickness of 3 mm and diameter of 60 mm. The depths of the <b>axial</b> <b>slot</b> are 33, 50 and 67 % of the thickness. The amplitude transmitted through the slots is found to be nearly proportional to the slot depth...|$|E

40|$|Aircraft {{jet engines}} must {{operate in a}} stable manner at all times. One source of {{instability}} is compressor stall. Stall problems can be reduced by machining cavities into the compressor casing adjacent to the rotor blades. This ‘casing treatment’ {{is the focus of}} the present work. Two treatment configurations are tested: circumferential grooves cut into the casing above the rotor blades, and <b>axial</b> <b>slots</b> cut into the casing adjacent to the rotor blade leading edges. The performance of a single casing groove is measured at different axial locations over the blade tips. For the first time, it is shown that there are two locations where compressor stability is maximised; near the leading edge and near mid-chord. The interaction between the groove and the compressor flow field is then studied. It is found that when located near the leading edge, the groove has a strong interaction with the near-casing flow and tip leakage vortex, but when located near mid-chord, the interaction is more subtle and less damaging to efficiency. Since the groove works well in both locations, it is concluded that manipulating the tip leakage vortex is not critical for improving compressor stability. Different groove numbers and cross-sections are then tested. For multiple grooves, the effi- ciency reduction is the sum of the constituent grooves, while the stall margin improvement is less than this sum. A simple square-section groove is found difficult to improve on, although in certain circumstances, a new ‘intermittent groove’ geometry is beneficial. The performance of <b>axial</b> <b>slots</b> is then investigated. Different slot shapes are tested and the results added to previous work to suggest an optimum slot geometry. A computational flow study shows that large variations in blade loading occur as the blades pass the slots, which could cause noise and vibration. It is found that while the flow inside the slot is principally a quasi-steady recirculation, the interaction between the slots and blades is highly unsteady, and this unsteadiness should not be neglected in design. In general, it is found that casing treatments that generate large stability improvements cause large efficiency losses. It is shown {{for the first time that}} the performance of casing grooves can be seriously reduced by changes in the stall inception mechanism. Maximum performance is achieved when the treated compressor stalls with a spike inception. Models from the literature are tested, but do not predict the stall inception mechanism well, which makes predicting the performance of casing grooves in a given compressor hard. Finally, it is shown that designing the blades and casing treatment as a unit may improve compressor performance...|$|R
