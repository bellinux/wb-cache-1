This observer {{is based on}} high order sliding approach (which allows robustness and finite time convergence). Its main originality in the automotive context consists in providing an estimation of both variables, wheels radius and vehicle velocity from only the wheel angular velocity derived from ABS (<b>Anti-Blocking</b> <b>System)</b> encoder position...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} simple rubber {{friction}} law, {{which can be}} used, e. g., in models of tire (and vehicle) dynamics. The friction law is tested by comparing numerical results to the full rubber friction theory (B. N. J. Persson, J. Phys. : Condensed Matter 18, 7789 (2006)). Good agreement is found between the two theories. We describe a two-dimensional (2 D) tire model which combines the rubber friction model with a simple mass-spring description of the tire body. The tire model is very flexible {{and can be used}} to calculate accurate mu-slip (and the self-aligning torque) curves for braking and cornering or combined motion (e. g., braking during cornering). We present numerical results which illustrate the theory. Simulations of <b>Anti-Blocking</b> <b>System</b> (ABS) braking are performed using two simple control algorithms.

40|$|<b>Anti-blocking</b> <b>system</b> (ABS) brake {{controllers}} pose unique {{challenges to}} the designer: a) For optimal performance, the controller must operate at an unstable equilibrium point, b) Depending on road conditions, the maximum braking torque may vary over a wide range, c) The tire slippage measurement signal, crucial for controller performance, is both highly uncertain and noisy, d) On rough roads, the tire slip ratio varies widely and rapidly due to tire bouncing, and e) The braking system contains transportation delays which limit the control system bandwidth. A digital controller design was chosen which combines a fuzzy logic element and a decision logic network. The controller identifies the current road condition and generates a command braking pressure signal, based on current and past readings of the slip ratio and brake pressure. The controller detects wheel blockage immediately and avoids excessive slipping. The ABS system performance is examined on a quarter vehicle model with nonlinear elastic suspension. The parallelity of the fuzzy logic evaluation process ensures rapid computation of the controller output signal, requiring less time and fewer computation steps than controllers with adaptive identification. The robustness of the braking system is investigated on rough roads and {{in the presence of}} large measurement noise. This paper describes design criteria, and the decision and rule structure of the control system. The simulation results present the system 2 ̆ 7 s performance on various road types and under rapidly changing road condition...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{investigation}} of a car collision with a pedestrian under limited visibility condi-tions. For this purpose an expert has to analyze the accident details and determine the critical time at which the car driver must take an action to avoid the collision. The analysis is complicated {{due to the fact}} that the vehicle is equipped with an <b>anti-blocking</b> braking <b>system</b> and does not leave a braking trace on the pavement.

40|$|In recent years, {{the number}} of {{electronics}} systems embedded in cars has dramatically increased. These devices control {{a large number of}} functionalities involving safety (e. g. <b>Anti-block</b> Braking <b>System</b> (ABS) control and Engine control), position (e. g. Global Position System (GPS)) or personal device connectivity (e. g. Bluetooth connection). Such an increased complexity of car electronics has made modern cars more vulnerable to cyber-attacks as there is a large number of potential access points given to a potential malicious entities. For this reason, the automotive industry is focusing towards the research of innovative security solutions to protect in-car systems. A valid approach to the current security demands in Automotive field is the Secure Hardware Extension (SHE) specified by the Hersteller Initiative Software (HIS) consortia, which encloses a set of useful functions for Automotive Security. The SHE improves a generic automotive microcontroller by the addition of a secure zone for the protection of cryptographic parameters (i. e. used in confidentiality-protected communications) and an authentication-based software environment. Therefore, it fulfills the recent needs of the automotive world in terms of confidentiality protection of data flowing over the various networks and a safe HW-SW interaction. In this work a flexible and efficient SHE module has been developed. The implemented SHE architecture consists of three major hardware sub-blocks: a cryptographic core, a cipher keys storage core and a control unit for interfacing with the external world such as a general purpose microprocessor. The cryptographic core is based on a flexible and efficient hardware implementation of the AES algorithm with the possibility of working with the Electronic Code Book (ECB), Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) and Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC) modes. On the other hand, the cipher keys that are contained within the SHE module can only be manipulated through specific secure interfaces. Furthermore, part of the work was the development of the software to control and verify the SHE functionality, making the HW/SW co-design a fundamental aspect of the project. The communication between the external processor and the system is an Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI) bus, which interacts with the SHE by a memory-mapped interface. The novelty introduced by this thesis is the implementation of an efficient SHE and the addition of cryptographic functions as 256 -bits keys support for the AES. The involved cryptographic algorithms have been tested against the official test vectors provided by the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST). The prototype of the SHE was implemented on a Xilinx Zynq- 7000 board reaching a 148 MHz clock frequency. The occupation of the final system is lower than 5 % of the LUTs and 2 % of the registers available on the FPGA. The SHE module has also been synthesized on a 40 nm standard-cell CMOS technology at 210 MHz leading to a size of 236 Kgates. In terms of performance, the reachable throughput at 148 MHz frequency is 34 Mbps for ECB, 33 Mbps for CBC and 16 Mbps for CMAC mode...|$|R
