5|$|Hitler named Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz as his successor. Himmler met Dönitz in Flensburg {{and offered}} himself as second-in-command.

Dönitz repeatedly rejected Himmler's overtures and initiated peace negotiations with the Allies. He wrote a letter on 6 May—two days before the German Instrument of Surrender—formally dismissing Himmler from all his posts.|$|E

The safety of the grasped object can be enhanced by providing a compliant control strategy. This paper presents a model reference adaptive compliance controller where a mass spring damper system can be introduced. The performance of model-based adaptive controller with the effect of friction and stiction is investigated. A few mathematical models of friction are considered i. e. static friction (stiction), coulomb friction (dry friction), viscous friction, drag friction and square root friction. It is observed that <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>positioning</b> and compliant control are feasible {{in the presence of}} friction and stiction in simulation. It is evident that the level of compliant control can be achieved during the object graspe...|$|R

5|$|The Swedish commanders {{had decided}} they {{must try to}} make a stand.

The Swedes had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>position,</b> with a small lake on the left flank and a forest on the right, providing good cover for a retreat to Nyborg should it be necessary. Opposing them were 9,000 men, with Eberstein in command that day. They divided into two lines, each commanded by the respective commanders. Thrice Eberstein attacked; only to be rebuffed by intensive Swedish fire and cavalry attacks. Eberstein himself was almost captured, only narrowly escaping.|$|E
5|$|The motive behind Edward's {{change of}} heart could have been purely pragmatic; Montfort was in <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>position</b> to support his cause in Gascony. When the King left for France in November, Edward's {{behaviour}} turned into pure insubordination. He made several appointments to {{advance the cause of}} the reformers, causing his father to believe that his son was considering a coup d'état. When the King returned from France, he initially refused to see his son, but through the mediation of the Earl of Cornwall and the Archbishop of Canterbury, the two were eventually reconciled. Edward was sent abroad, and in November 1260 he again united with the Lusignans, who had been exiled to France.|$|E

5|$|The repercussions {{from the}} Rapid Wien ties {{followed}} Celtic into the 1985–86 European Cup Winners' Cup campaign. The first round saw them pitted against old foes Atlético Madrid. Mo Johnston's headed goal from a Davie Provan cross and Pat Bonner's late penalty save from Rubio secured a 11 draw away in Madrid, putting Celtic in <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>position</b> {{to win the}} tie. The second leg in Glasgow, however, was played {{in front of an}} empty stadium as punishment for the fans' behaviour the previous season in the replayed game against Rapid.

5|$|For the club's centenary {{season of}} 197475, Saunders brought {{in only two}} new players, Frank Carrodus and Leighton Phillips. At {{the end of his}} first season in charge, Villa were back in the First Division after {{finishing}} second, and had won the 1975 League Cup final at Wembley Stadium. Villa beat Norwich City 10 with Ray Graydon scoring the winning goal. At the beginning of the 197576 season Doug Ellis resigned as chairman but remained on the board. Ellis left the club in <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>position</b> on the field. They were in the First Division and the UEFA Cup for the first time due to the League Cup win of 1975. The club's first season of European football was short-lived though as they were beaten 51 by Antwerp in the first round. In the following season, Villa finished fourth in the League, and reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. In the 197677 season, two years after their last League Cup win, they beat Everton 32 in the 1977 Final after a second replay.|$|E
5|$|He {{scored a}} hard hitting 76 {{in the first}} innings of the Second Test at Lord's to help Australia take control, but a {{stubborn}} partnership by Bailey and Willie Watson saw England hang on for a draw. Davidson bowled only 24.5 overs for the match, and Wardle was his only wicket. Rainy weather greeted {{the players in the}} Third Test at Old Trafford and more than half the playing time was washed out. Davidson took 2/60 in the drawn match, removing Reg Simpson and Willie Watson. Australia were in <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>position</b> {{at the start of the}} final day of the Fourth Test at Headingley, with England leading by only 78 runs with five wickets in hand. However, Bailey (38) and Jim Laker (48) stubbornly resisted with a mixture of time-wasting and dour defence. Davidson eventually removed both, but there was not enough time remaining to secure an Australian victory. His match figures of 3/59 from 50.1 overs were in large part due to the defensive tactics of England. The fate of The Ashes thus came down to the Fifth Test at The Oval. Davidson scored 22 and 21 and could not take a wicket as England won by eight wickets to regain the urn for the first time in two decades. Australia had blundered by omitting a specialist spinner, mistakenly thinking that the pitch would not spin. Davidson hit England's spinners out of the attack for a period, but succumbed to the variable bounce of the pitch.|$|E

5|$|The next day, England resumed {{hoping for}} more of what {{happened}} on the opening day. The ground was again full, with even more people squashed in than the previous day. The sun was obscured by heavy cloud cover, further hindering the visibility of a ground without a sightscreen. The two English batsmen were initially tentative and played and missed frequently, and only two singles were scored in the first 15 minutes of play. The England team frequently looked towards the sky; as they needed to win the match and were in <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>position,</b> they hoped that time would not be lost to rain. Bradman set a deep-set defensive field as he sought to have Lindwall and Johnston contain the batsmen before the third new ball became available. In all, England scored only five runs in the first half-hour, as the two batsmen sought to survive and be set when the new ball was taken and the Australian attack advantaged. During this time the main threat to the batsmen was Lindwall, who bowled a spell at high pace and unsettled Edrich, who sparred at a number of balls. As soon as it was possible, Bradman took the new ball, and Bedser endeavoured to keep his wicket intact to shield Denis Compton and the other middle-order batsmen from having to come in against a swinging ball. During this period Bedser did not attempt to exploit his strong physique to hit the ball hard. Continuing the defensive strategy of seeing off the new ball, {{it was not until the}} 48th minute of play that Edrich reached his 50 in 193 minutes, although he did miss several attempted cut shots that went past the outside edge. However, the hosts had seen off the new ball without losing a wicket. Bedser then glanced a ball for four; England scored only 22 runs in the first hour.|$|E

40|$|Positioning of nucleosomes along {{eukaryotic}} genomes {{plays an}} important role in their organization and regulation. There are many different factors affecting the location of nucleosomes. Some can be viewed as preferential binding of a single nucleosome to different locations along the DNA and some as interactions between neighboring nucleosomes. In this study we analyzed how well nucleosomes are positioned along the DNA as a function of strength of the preferential binding, correlation length of the binding energy landscape, interactions between neighboring nucleosomes and others relevant system properties. We analyze different scenarios: designed energy landscapes and generically disordered ones and derive conditions for <b>good</b> <b>positioning.</b> Using analytic and numerical approaches we find that, even if the binding preferences are very weak, synergistic interplay between the interactions and the binding preferences is essential for <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>positioning</b> of nucleosomes, especially on correlated energy landscapes. Analyzing empirical energy landscape, we discuss relevance of our theoretical results to positioning of nucleosomes on DNA in vivo. Comment: 21 pages, 20 figure...|$|R
