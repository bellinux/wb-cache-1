5|$|As senior officer, Lamason {{had access}} to the main camp and quickly built a rapport with the group. As a result, he was able to secure extra blankets, clothes, clogs and food for the airmen. Lamason also built a rapport with two other prisoners; French {{scientist}} Alfred Balachowsky and Dutch Olympian trainer Jan Robert. Both men had developed trustworthy contacts within the camp administrative area <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to provide Lamason with reliable intelligence that assisted in the survival of the airmen.|$|E
5|$|At any rate, Philip {{chose to}} build lembi. These were the small fast galleys {{used by the}} Illyrians. They had a single bank of oars <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to carry 50 {{soldiers}} {{in addition to the}} rowers. With these, Philip could hope to avoid or evade the Roman fleet, preoccupied as he hoped it would be with Hannibal, and based, as it was, at Lilybaeum in western Sicily.|$|E

After his death the original programme, which had included an exploration of Enderby Land, was abandoned. Wild led a brief cruise which brought them into sight of Elephant Island.

5|$|Some historians contend {{the goals}} of Great Naktong Offensive were {{unattainable}} from the beginning. The Americans, who had been better equipped than the North Koreans, were easily able to defeat their opponents once they {{had the chance to}} form a continuous line, according to historian T. R. Fehrenbach. At the same time, the North Koreans did break through the perimeter at several points <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to exploit their gains for a short time.|$|E

5|$|The Cliffords {{successfully}} recombined {{the former}} Vieuxpont estates by 1333, <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to controlled the Eden valley through their castles at Appleby, Brougham, Pendragon and Brough. Robert Clifford controlled Brough by around 1308 and improved the defences, rebuilding the east wall and constructing a new hall, alongside his apartments which {{were located in}} a new circular tower, called Clifford's Tower. These apartments may have been similar to those surviving at Appleby Castle, also built by Robert.|$|E
5|$|The {{predictions}} made by Diem and Ely {{were extremely}} inaccurate. There had been heavy fighting in northern Vietnam, where the Vietminh {{were at their}} strongest, and many people {{had been forced to}} abandon their homes. Although French charities had been operating in the north, the refugee camps were disorganised <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to provide little more than shelter. As a result, there was a great number of northerners who wanted to leave and start a new life in the south.|$|E
5|$|A {{fleet of}} 40 AEC Routemaster buses were {{purchased}} from London Transport in 1986 {{to launch the}} new services in competition with Strathclyde Buses. Kelvin had not previously employed conductors, but introduced them for these services. This meant the vehicles {{did not have to}} spend as long loading at bus stops as one-person operated buses <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to offer quicker journeys through Glasgow. The Routemasters proved popular with both passengers and staff and continued to operate into the 1990s under successor company Kelvin Central, {{which was one of the}} last operators of the type in regular service in Scotland.|$|E

5|$|A {{week later}} with the skies clearing, birds began to appear, {{signalling}} a proximity to land. On 28 May, the Great Barrier Reef was sighted; Bligh found a navigable gap and sailed the launch into a calm lagoon. Late that afternoon, he ran the boat ashore on a small island which he named Restoration Island, where the men found oysters and berries in plentiful supply <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to eat ravenously. Over the next four days, the party island-hopped northward within the lagoon, aware that their movements were being closely monitored by natives on the mainland. Strains were showing within the party; following a heated disagreement with Purcell, Bligh grabbed a cutlass and challenged the carpenter to fight. Fryer told Cole to arrest their captain, but backed down after Bligh threatened to kill him if he interfered.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} reinforcements {{from the}} colonial headquarters at Batavia, the Dutch launched an attack in 1635 <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to crush opposition {{and bring the}} area around present-day Tainan fully under their control. After seeing Mattau and Soulang, the most powerful villages in the area, defeated so comprehensively, many other villages in the surrounding area came to the Dutch to seek peace and surrender sovereignty. Thus the Dutch were able to dramatically expand {{the extent of their}} territorial control in a short time, and avoid the need for further fighting. The campaign ended in February 1636, when representatives from twenty-eight villages attended a ceremony in Tayouan to cement Dutch sovereignty.|$|E
5|$|After {{six years}} at the Kestrels, the {{defection}} saw Kydd forced {{to adapt to a}} new shooting combination with veteran international Sharelle McMahon. As she had had little opportunity to train with the new team before the opening of the season, the pair initially had some difficulty adjusting to each other's style. After a tenuous start, however, the pair found form, <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to form a relatively successful combination. Kydd scored 360 goals in the season, and assisted the Phoenix in becoming the top scoring side for the season, although occasionally patchy form from the team as a whole saw the Phoenix slip outside the top two at season's end. Kydd was overlooked for a return to international selection during the 2006–07 season.|$|E

5|$|After {{the stellar}} {{parameters}} were established, the Kepler science team ran models and fits {{to ensure that}} Kepler-5's transit event was not a false positive, such as an eclipsing binary star. Once the planetary nature of Kepler-5b was established, the Kepler team searched for the planet's occultation behind its star, hoping to find the temperature on its day side. They found both, <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to set the equilibrium temperature of the planet. The use of speckle imaging using adaptive optics at the WIYN Observatory in Arizona and the Palomar Observatory in California isolated the starlight of Kepler-5 from background stars.|$|E
5|$|Broadly speaking, however, {{it appears}} that the ships were well-handled and commanded. Contemporary {{observers}} were surprised to note that the crewmen, despite lacking white officers, had complete control of their warships <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to stay in good formation as they circled around the bay. The rebels favored firing over the city or around government-controlled military targets rather than outright destruction, something that Zachary Morgan believes was motivated by either humanitarian concerns or (at the very least) pragmatism—by limiting the actual damage, they could gain support among legislators, the press, and general population. This has, however, caused a historiographical argument among scholars that persists to this day.|$|E
5|$|By about noon, the Confederates {{had formed}} an attack line {{and were in}} {{position}} to advance on the works. Because of the forest {{on the west side}} of the Mauckport Road, a company of men dismounted and attacked the works head on. They were repulsed three times, but the Legion suffered a casualty during the second wave. Simultaneously, the Confederates launched a flanking maneuver on the eastern wing of the defensive works. The initial flanking attempt was prevented because of the superior weapons held by the thirty Legion soldiers on that wing. They were equipped with Henry rifles capable of firing fourteen rounds before reloading, <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to keep the Confederates pinned down in the open field for about twenty minutes.|$|E
