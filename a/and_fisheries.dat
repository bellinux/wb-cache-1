The potatoes had been developed by biochemist John Gatehouse at Cambridge Agricultural Genetics (later renamed Axis Genetics) and had recently completed two years of field trials at Rothamsted Experimental Station. The GNA gene from the Galanthus (snowdrop) plant was inserted into the potato, allowing the GNA lectin protein to be synthesised. This lectin {{has been shown to}} be toxic to some insects.|$|E

In this case, it is interesting to reveal the practical interaction and evaluate about both activities in supporting each other. According to the tourism masterplan of Banyuwangi City, East Java, Indonesia, there is a referral for tourism <b>and</b> <b>fishery</b> activities in order to support each other in one area, Boom Beach. The referral for interaction of supporting each other between tourism <b>and</b> <b>fishery</b> activities which mentioned in tourism masterplan of Banyuwangi City did not followed with step to realized it effectively yet. Moreover, development of tourism area in Boom Beach can not be optimally done. Concerning to the above situation, this research tries to evaluate how does the interaction of zonation of tourism <b>and</b> <b>fishery</b> activities in Boom Beach, is there something which makes tourism <b>and</b> <b>fishery</b> activities seperated in a different places. Analysis which done to answer the research question is evaluative analysis by employing activities map which got from questioaire and community mapping by users of the space.

Based upon the result of this study, zonation of tourism <b>and</b> <b>fishery</b> activities in Boom Beach separated in two different places because both activities has a different needed of place, tourism activities in Boom Beach need a sandy place to support it's activities either fishery activities need a place near to the dock in order the local fisherman has a easier access to loading-unloading fish, selling fish and take the fish to the market.

5|$|The Ecological {{footprint}} measures {{human consumption}} {{in terms of}} the biologically productive land needed to provide the resources, and absorb the wastes of the average global citizen. In 2008 it required 2.7 global hectares per person, 30% more than the natural biological capacity of 2.1 global hectares (assuming no provision for other organisms). The resulting ecological deficit must be met from unsustainable extra sources and these are obtained in three ways: embedded in the goods and services of world trade; taken from the past (e.g. fossil fuels); or borrowed from the future as unsustainable resource usage (e.g. by over exploiting forests <b>and</b> <b>fisheries).</b>|$|E

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the round ribbontail ray as Vulnerable. It cannot withstand heavy fishing pressure {{due to its}} low reproductive rate, and there is widespread degradation of its coral reef habitat, including from agricultural runoff and destructive fishing practices such as blast fishing. This species is caught by commercial <b>and</b> <b>fisheries</b> throughout its range, using line gear and trawls. One region where it is heavily pressured is in Indonesian waters, where it and other large rays are taken intentionally and otherwise by tangle netters, longliners, and trawlers operating off Java, Bali, New Guinea, and Lombok. All landed individuals are brought to market for human consumption.|$|E
5|$|The fishery {{industry}} {{not only}} threatens marine mammals through by-catch, but also through competition for food. Large scale fisheries {{have led to}} the depletion of fish stocks that are important prey species for marine mammals. Pinnipeds have been especially affected by the direct loss of food supplies and in some cases the harvesting of fish has led to food shortages or dietary deficiencies, starvation of young, and reduced recruitment into the population. As the fish stocks have been depleted, the competition between marine mammals <b>and</b> <b>fisheries</b> has sometimes led to conflict. Large-scale culling of populations of marine mammals by commercial fishers has been initiated {{in a number of areas}} in order to protect fish stocks for human consumption.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} inhabits {{offshore}} environments, where it dives {{to the sea}} floor to forage. It preys mostly on marine invertebrates such as sea urchins, various molluscs and crustaceans, and some species of fish. Its foraging and eating habits are noteworthy in several respects. First, its use of rocks to dislodge prey and to open shells makes {{it one of the}} few mammal species to use tools. In most of its range, it is a keystone species, controlling sea urchin populations which would otherwise inflict extensive damage to kelp forest ecosystems. Its diet includes prey species that are also valued by humans as food, leading to conflicts between sea otters <b>and</b> <b>fisheries.</b>|$|E
