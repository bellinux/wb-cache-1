As sunset {{and the cold}} hours draw near, all assemble about the fire, generally two or three huge palm trunks, whose blaze gladdens {{the soul of the}} lonely night-sentinel; and, assembling the Shaykhs of the Arabs, we gather from them information geographical, historical, and ethnological.

During the whole day, but notably at this hour, we have the normal distractions of the Arabian journey. One man brings, and expects [...] "bakhshísh" [...] for, a bit of broken metal or some ridiculous stone; another grumbles for meat; and a third wants tobacco, medicine, or something to be had for the asking. I am careful to pay liberally, as by so doing the country is well scoured.|$|E

The top section was built to show the numeral 4 on each side. Of the 100 floors, the top 50 belong to the team, while the bottom 50 belong to the former tenants of the Baxter Building.

Further, Atwood questions what would happen if these trends, and especially [...] "casually held attitudes about women" [...] were taken to their logical end. Atwood continues to argue that all of the scenarios offered in The Handmaid's Tale have actually occurred in real life—in an interview she gave regarding Oryx and Crake, Atwood maintains that [...] "As with The Handmaid's Tale, I didn't put in anything that we haven't already done, we're not already doing, we're seriously trying to do, coupled with trends that are already in progress... So all of those things are real, and therefore the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> pure <b>invention</b> is close to nil." [...] Atwood was also known to carry around newspaper clippings to her various interviews to support her fiction's basis in reality. Atwood has explained that The Handmaid's Tale is a response to those who claim the oppressive, totalitarian, and religious governments that have taken hold in other countries throughout the years [...] "can't happen here"—but in this work, she has tried to show how such a takeover might play out.|$|R
6000|$|Passing from {{generalities}} {{to special}} considerations, {{it is to}} be remarked that in practice the Pestalozzian system seems scarcely to have fulfilled the promise of its theory. We hear of children not at all interested in its lessons,--disgusted with them rather; and, so far as we can gather, the Pestalozzian school have not turned out any unusual proportion of distinguished men: if even they have reached the average. We are not surprised at this. The success of every appliance depends mainly upon the intelligence with which it is used. It is a trite remark that, having the choicest tools, an unskilful artisan will botch his work; and bad teachers will fail even with the best methods. Indeed, the goodness of the method becomes in such case a cause of failure; as, to continue the simile, the perfection of the tool becomes in undisciplined hands a source of imperfection in results. A simple, unchanging, almost mechanical routine of tuition, may be carried out by the commonest intellects, with such small beneficial effect as it is capable of producing; but a complete system--a system as heterogeneous in its appliances as the mind in its faculties--a system proposing a special means for each special end, demands for its right employment powers such as few teachers possess. The mistress of a dame-school can hear spelling-lessons; and any hedge-schoolmaster can drill boys in the multiplication-table. But to teach spelling rightly by using the powers of the letters instead of their names, or to instruct in numerical combinations by experimental synthesis, a modicum of understanding is needful; and to pursue a like rational course throughout the entire range of studies, asks an <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> judgment, <b>of</b> <b>invention,</b> <b>of</b> intellectual sympathy, of analytical faculty, which we shall never see applied to it while the tutorial official is held in such small esteem. True education is practicable only by a true philosopher. Judge, then, what prospect a philosophical method now has of being acted out! Knowing so little as we yet do of psychology, and ignorant as our teachers are of that little, what chance has a system which requires psychology for its basis? ...|$|R

Its goal is to describe options of interpretation of children's literature and to demonstrate these options by means of Kubín's literal work. As a result, this bachelor's thesis also highlights semantics riches and valuable qualities {{of this part of}} Kubín's work, which is being neglected by publishers nowadays. In its theoretical part, the thesis addresses several issues: different ways of interpretation of fairy tales, specification of the term "author fairy tale" and the different forms of Kubín's fairy tales. As a method of interpretation, synthesis of several approaches (Franz, Šmahelová, Urbanová, and others) was used and each of these approaches was described by one example. This synthesis provides insight into the meaning of fairy tales that can be therefore understood as representation of situations outlined not only with help of motives but with help of specific expressions as well. Collections of fairy tales authored by Kubín are analyzed in respect to the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> Kubín's own <b>invention</b> compared with the quantity of folk motives. This analysis is accompanied by brief Kubín's biography and [...] ...|$|R
