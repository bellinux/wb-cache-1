60|$|The counsel on {{the other}} side say that all this {{intelligence}} comes in an anonymous paper without date, transmitted from a newspaper-writer at Fyzabad. This is the contempt with which they treat this serious paper, sent to Mr. Hastings himself by official authority,--by Hoolas Roy, who was the news-writer at Fyzabad,--the person appointed to convey authentic intelligence concerning the state of it to the Resident at Lucknow. The Resident received it as such; he transmitted it to Mr. Hastings; and it was not till this hour, till the counsel were instructed (God forgive them for obeying such instructions!) to treat these things with ridicule, that we have heard this Hoolas Roy called a common news-writer of <b>anonymous</b> <b>information,</b> and the like. If the information had come in any way the least authentic, instead of coming in a manner the most authentic in which it was possible to come to Mr. Hastings, he was bound by every feeling of humanity, every principle of regard to his own honor and his employers', to see whether it was true or false; if false, to refute it; if true, to afford redress: he has done neither. Therefore we charge him with being the cause; we charge upon him the consequences, with all the aggravations attending them; and we call both upon justice and humanity for redress, as far as it can be afforded to these people, and for the severest punishments which your Lordships can inflict upon the author of these evils. If, instead of the mass of crimes that we have brought before you, this singly had been charged upon the prisoner, I will say that it is a greater crime than any man has ever been impeached for before the House of Lords, from the first records of Parliament to this hour.|$|E

5000|$|The Publius Enigma is an Internet {{phenomenon}} (and potentially an unsolved problem) {{that began}} with cryptic messages posted by a user identifying only as [...] "Publius" [...] to the unmoderated Usenet newsgroup alt.music.pink-floyd through the Penet remailer, a now defunct <b>anonymous</b> <b>information</b> exchange service.

Pink Floyd's lead singer, David Gilmour, denied any involvement while album artist Storm Thorgerson was bemused by the ordeal. Drummer Nick Mason claimed that EMI Records were ultimately responsible. It remains unclear if the enigma involves a genuinely solvable puzzle as part of an early Internet-based contest or was a convoluted hoax engineered in part by the band's management.

5000|$|There are {{at least}} two {{instances}} of cross dressing balls that have been documented in England. The first one was known through a police raid of a ball celebrated in Temperance Hall, in the Hulme area of Manchester. On September 24, 1880, the chief constable of Manchester received an <b>anonymous</b> <b>information</b> about an event [...] "of an immoral character" [...] that was about to take place in the Temperance Hall of Hulme. The detective Jerome Caminada introduced two policemen dressed as women amongst those that had been gathering in the ball room after 9 p.m. Of the 47 men that congregated, all dressed in the most wild dresses, 22 as women; a pair was dressed as Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, and another as Romeo and Juliet. Detective Caminada oberved the ball from a neighboring roof, all young men between 20 and 30 years old, that had begun dancing about 10 p.m.; every now and then, a couple disappeared into a side room. About 1 a.m., after detective Caminada thought enough crimes had been committed, he gained entry shouting the password [...] "sister" [...] in an effeminate manner. After the door was opened, the police raided the building, and detained all participants. The trial showed that the dancers were not from Manchester, they were regulars of similar balls that were organized in several cities, as Leeds, or Nottingham. The judge, thinking about the possible scandal for the city, let them go free.|$|E
