This paper summarizes experiments, and finite-element analyses, used to model the <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> in a steel column. A method to minimize column <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> is then proposed and investigated with finite-element analyses.

40|$|Long term <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> {{in a tall}} {{concrete}} structure is a second-order effect that is of some impediment to the serviceability, and in some cases, structural integrity of the building. The research here involves analysis of <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> elements that interact through framing action. In many tall concrete buildings framing is inherent as columns, beams and floors are quite often connected with rigid connections. The mechanics of differential <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> and framing action due to rigid connections causes load sharing between vertical elements that fundamentally affects the degree of both absolute and differential <b>axial</b> <b>shortening.</b> Evaluation of <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> by analysis of a structural system consisting of discrete elements over-predicts the level of <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> when framing is present. A methodology to calculate <b>axial</b> <b>shortening,</b> accounting for load sharing of axial loads for tall concrete buildings, is developed. The application of this methodology {{to the construction of}} a tall concrete building allowing for the building cycle is presented. A program is written that incorporates both the methodology and its application to a tall building, using the ACT concrete creep and shrinkage models. Correlation of the program is made against an existing previously tested program that does not allow for framing action. A comparison is made between the two sets of data for an actual 85 storey building. From this it is concluded that; i) Framing action reduces the differential <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> between two elements ii) The core generally experiences less change to <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> than columns iii) The effect of framing cannot be estimated by a relative percentage adjustment applied uniformly to each storey...|$|E
40|$|<b>Axial</b> <b>shortening</b> in {{vertical}} load bearing elements of reinforced concrete high-rise buildings {{is caused by}} the time dependent effects of shrinkage, creep and elastic shortening of concrete under loads. Such phenomenon has to be predicted at design stage and then updated during and after construction of the buildings in order to provide mitigation against the adverse effects of differential <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> among the elements. Existing measuring methods for updating previous predictions of <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> pose problems. With this in mind, a innovative procedure with a vibration based parameter called <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> index is proposed to update <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> of vertical elements based on variations in vibration characteristics of the buildings. This paper presents the development of the procedure and illustrates it through a numerical example of an unsymmetrical high-rise building with two outrigger and belt systems. Results indicate that the method has the capability to capture influence of different tributary areas, shear walls of outrigger and belt systems as well as the geometric complexity of the building...|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of concrete column shortening {{has been widely}} acknowledged since it first became apparent in the 1960 s. <b>Axial</b> column <b>shortening</b> {{is due to the}} combined effect of elastic and inelastic deformations, shrinkage and creep. This study aims to investigate the effects of ambient temperature, relative humidity, cement hardening speed and aggregate type on concrete column shortening. The investigation was conducted using a column shortening prediction model which is underpinned by the Eurocode 2. Critical analysis and evaluation of the results showed that the concrete aggregate types used in the concrete have significant impact on column shortening. Generally, aggregates with higher moduli of elasticity hold the best results in terms of shortening. Cement type used is another significant factor, as using slow hardening cement gives better results compared to rapid hardening cement. This study also showed that environmental factors, namely, ambient temperature and relative humidity have less impact on column shortening...|$|R

As a consequence, <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> becomes a common phenomenon in a multistoried steel structure. A 100 storied steel structure is analyzed in SAP 2000 {{to study the}} magnitude overall effects of column shortening. It was found from the study that the maximum <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> occurs at the columns of top storey of the steel structure and at the columns of bottom storey, the axial deformation is negligible. The increasing rate of <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> is significant at the initial levels. However, at the upper levels, the amount of <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> in steel columns differs insignificantly. In the selected rigid frame structure, the <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> of adjacent steel columns is found to influence significantly the differential shortening of the structure.

40|$|Non linear {{deformation}} of concrete has an adverse impact on high-rise buildings with complex geometries due to differential <b>axial</b> <b>shortening.</b> These adverse effects {{are caused by}} time dependent behaviour resulting in volume change known as “shrinkage”, “creep” and “elastic” deformation. These three phenomena govern the behaviour and performance of all concrete elements during and after construction. Reinforcement content, variable concrete modulus, volume to surface area ratio of elements, environmental conditions and construction quality influence the performance of concrete elements and differential <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> will occur in all structural systems. Their detrimental effects escalate with increasing height and non vertical load paths resulting from geometric complexity.

40|$|Concrete is {{commonly}} used as a primary construction material for tall building construction. Load bearing components such as columns and walls in concrete buildings are subjected to instantaneous and long term <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> caused by the time dependent effects of "shrinkage", "creep" and "elastic" deformations. Reinforcing steel content, variable concrete modulus, volume to surface area ratio of the elements and environmental conditions govern <b>axial</b> <b>shortening.</b> The impact of differential <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> among columns and core shear walls escalate with increasing building height. Differential <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> of gravity loaded elements in geometrically complex and irregular buildings result in permanent distortion and deflection of the structural frame which {{have a significant impact}} on building envelopes, building services, secondary systems and the life time serviceability and performance of a building. Existing numerical methods commonly used in design to quantify <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> are mainly based on elastic analytical techniques and therefore unable to capture the complexity of non-linear time dependent effect. Ambient measurements of <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> using vibrating wire, external mechanical strain, and electronic strain gauges are methods that are available to verify pre-estimated values from the design stage. Installing these gauges permanently embedded in or on the surface of concrete components for continuous measurements during and after construction with adequate protection is uneconomical, inconvenient and unreliable. Therefore such methods are rarely if ever used in actual practice of building construction. This research project has developed a rigorous numerical procedure that encompasses linear and non-linear time dependent phenomena for prediction of <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> of reinforced concrete structural components at design stage. This procedure takes into consideration (i) construction sequence, (ii) time varying values of Young's Modulus of reinforced concrete and (iii) creep and shrinkage models that account for variability resulting from environmental effects. The capabilities of the procedure are illustrated through examples. In order to update previous predictions of <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> during the construction and service stages of the building, this research has also developed a vibration based procedure using ambient measurements. This procedure takes into consideration the changes in vibration characteristic of structure during and after construction. The application of this procedure is illustrated through numerical examples which also highlight the features. The vibration based procedure can also be used as a tool to assess structural health/performance of key structural components in the building during construction and service life...|$|E
40|$|To {{demonstrate}} axial artery motion {{during the}} cardiac cycle, the common carotid arteries (CCA) of 10 pigs were exposed and equipped with piezoelectric crystals sutured onto the artery as axial position detectors. An echo-tracking system {{was used to}} simultaneously measure the CCA diameter. For each animal, data for pressure, length, and diameter were collected at a frequency of 457 Hz. At a mean pulse pressure of 33 +/- 8 mmHg, the mean systolodiastolic length difference was 0. 3 +/- 0. 01 mm for a mean arterial segment of 11. 35 +/- 1. 25 mm. Systolic and diastolic diameters were 4. 1 +/- 0. 3 and 3. 9 +/- 0. 2 mm, respectively. The examined CCA segment displayed a mean <b>axial</b> systolic <b>shortening</b> of 2. 7 %. This study clearly demonstrates, for the first time, that {{the length of a}} segment of the CCA changes during the cardiac cycle and that this movement is inversely correlated with pulse pressure. It is also apparent that the segmental axial strain is significantly smaller than the diameter variation during the cardiac cycle and that the impact of the axial strain for compliance computation should be further evaluated...|$|R

After a first mathematical and geometric analysis, this second experimental study on sawbones, was to compare Weil osteotomy, Weil osteotomy with resection of a bone slice on the proximal fragment, made after the proximal translation of the distal fragment, and the cervical <b>shortening</b> <b>axial</b> osteotomy. These were performed on 20 sawbones, divided into four groups: Weil osteotomies were performed in the first three groups: using a horizontal cut in group 1, a 10 ° oblique cut in group 2, and a 20 ° oblique cut in group 3; cervical <b>shortening</b> <b>axial</b> osteotomies were performed in group 4. In a second part, the Weil osteotomies were completed by bone slice resections on the proximal fragment. In each group, the head fragment was translated one centimeter proximally. The radiographic assessement used bony lanmarks to analyse morphological changes, and the projection of these landmarks on the horizontal line. The length, heigth, and declination angles variations were mesured. With an horizontal Weil osteotomy, we found no plantar displacement of the head, but an increased metatarsal declination angle, averaging 2. 6 °. In an oblique Weil osteotomy, head plantar displacement is associated with a greater metatarsal declination angle. For the 10 ° angle oblique oteotomy, the head's plantar displacement average 2. 2 mm and the metatarsal declination angle 4. 2 ° and for 20 ° angle oblique osteotomy, the head plantar displacement average 2. 8 mm and the metatarsal declination angle 6. 4 °. The bone slice resection, made just after the proximal translation of the metatarsal head, in the Weil osteotomy, resulted in the correction of head plantar displacement and metatarsal angle modifications. For the 10 ° angle oblique Weil ostetomy, the head displacement is 1, 8 mm dorsal, and the declination angle is reduce to 0. 4 °; and for an 20 ° oblique Weil osteotomy, the results are 2. 2 mm for the head dorsal displacement, and 0. 4 ° for the declination angle. In the <b>shortening</b> cervical <b>axial</b> osteotomy, the metatarsal head follow a dorsal displacement but also a plantar displacement secondary to the plantar bone block preserved on the distal fragment, resulting in a 1. 2 mm dorsal position.

40|$|International audienceGeochronology, {{structural}} and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility {{data from the}} northern Vosges batholith, which belongs to the Northern Vosges-Mid-German Crystalline Rise arc, show contrasting emplacement modes of southern granodiorites and northern granites. The ENE-WSW-trending fabrics of granodiorites (346 - 334 Ma) are parallel to the metamorphic cleavage affecting the host rocks developed during regional compression. The NNW-SSE-trending fabrics of younger granitoids (c. 330 Ma) reveal an extensional emplacement mode, associated with a normal shear zone separating the two magmatic suites. Palaeomagnetism shows that the switch from a compressive to an extensional regime coincides with a regional counterclockwise rotation. The 330 - 325 Ma extension is further supported by palaeomagnetic and seismic data indicating southeastward tilt of the whole batholith. Finally the system is rotated clockwise without any structural overprint. Data from the Early Carboniferous northern Vosges magmatic arc and remote Bohemian Massif suggest that this evolution is valid for the whole eastern branch of the European Variscan belt, for which the following model is proposed: (1) Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous east-west shortening of the Variscides above the Rhenohercynian subduction zone; (2) <b>axial</b> NNW-SSE <b>shortening</b> of the assembled Variscan orogen associated with (3) 'internal' sinistral rotation of inherited Rhenohercynian transform faults and shortening of intervening blocks; (4) east-west extension and dextral 'external' rotation of blocks between dextrally reactivated transforms...|$|R

40|$|Tall {{concrete}} buildings experience time-dependent <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> {{which may}} be interpreted as either absolute or differential, the former being {{with respect to a}} single column or core element, the latter being with respect to adjacent elements. The types of analyses undertaken to determine <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> would normally be deterministic, the rigour being commensurate with the degree of shortening likely to be experienced. Mathematical rigour, however, {{may or may not be}} justified in the context of the natural variability of constituent parameters and thus a closer examination of the probabilistic uncertainties associated with <b>axial</b> <b>shortening,</b> particularly for tall buildings, is warranted. Shortening is influenced by, amongst other things, the complex load history of a building during its construction cycle. In this context the properties of concrete are investigated to determine those that are critical to any <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> analysis. The work here describes three probabilistic techniques, namely, Monte Carlo simulation, and first- and secondorder moment analyses. Each incorporates random constitutive information in addition to a rigorous procedure for obtaining the representative shortening values. Element behaviour is modelled by the composite models of either Faber, Trost and Bazant, Dischinger or improved Dischinger, combined with the recommendations of the ACI, CEB-FIP, AS- 3600 and other sources for describing creep and shrinkage. These models are coupled with the detailed load history of each successive element, based on the construction sequence of the building, and the usual environmental effects, resulting in a procedure capable of analysing fully the <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> effects to a high level of detail and with a measured degree of certainty. A software program has been developed to do this analysis. The probabilistic distributions of <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> results are subsequently determined using standard goodness of fit tests. With numerous predictive methods available for column behaviour, the author sets out to examine their differences in the context of <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> behaviour. An assessment of the sensitivity of each input parameter, in addition to comparisons with other predictive procedures is made. Conclusions follow from these studies. Finally, the probabilistic models are, to a limited extent, compared to field data of column shortenings...|$|E
40|$|A 3 D Eulerian {{numerical}} model {{was developed to}} investigate the effect of micro-swing on joint formation during workpiece oscillation in linear friction welding (LFW). The temperature field and <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> history for different amplitudes of micro-swing have been studied.

Flash volume and <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> increase as the amplitude of micro-swing becomes larger. When the amplitude of micro-swing is more than a critical value, a sudden change of <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> (different from the period of the oscillation cycle) would occur at certain welding time, which change would also have a periodic nature. Although different amplitudes of micro-swing affect joint morphology, the inner temperature field and the highest temperature of joints remain constant. The high temperature region inside the joints remains about the same, when the amplitude of micro-swing is constant. This indicates that the heat generated through plastic deformation could maintain the welding process, and so that the welding process would enter the equilibrium phase...|$|E

40|$|Differential <b>axial</b> <b>shortening,</b> {{distortion}} and deformation in {{high rise}} buildings {{is a serious}} concern. They are caused by three time dependent modes of volume change; “shrinkage”, “creep” and “elastic shortening” {{that takes place in}} every concrete element during and after construction. Vertical concrete components in a high rise building are sized and designed based on their strength demand to carry gravity and lateral loads. Therefore, columns and walls are sized, shaped and reinforced differently with varying concrete grades and volume to surface area ratios. These structural components may be subjected to the detrimental effects of differential <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> that escalates with increasing the height of buildings. This can have an adverse impact on other structural and non-structural elements. Limited procedures are available to quantify <b>axial</b> <b>shortening,</b> and the results obtained from them differ because each procedure is based on various assumptions and limited to few parameters. All these prompt to a need to develop an accurate numerical procedure to quantify the <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> of concrete buildings taking into account the important time varying functions of (i) construction sequence (ii) Young’s Modulus and (iii) creep and shrinkage models associated with reinforced concrete. General assumptions are refined to minimize variability of creep and shrinkage parameters to improve accuracy of the results.

We review the global fossil record of the Triassic lower actinopterygian Saurichthys, which is used herein for {{a case study of}} trends in morphological adaptations as well as variations in palaeogeographic distribution and diversity dynamics of Early Mesozoic fishes. In the Early Triassic, Saurichthys already occupied a top position in marine food webs, with some species achieving body lengths of up to 1. 5 m.

The postcranial adaptations in particular helped to improve the fast-start ability of these ambush predatory fishes. The palaeogeographic range of Saurichthys changed from a virtually global distribution in the Early Triassic (indicating rapid dispersal within marine and freshwater ecosystems after the end-Permian mass extinction) to an occurrence mainly restricted to the north-western Tethys in the Late Triassic, and also towards increasing rarity within continental deposits. Modifications in the palaeogeographic distribution were accompanied by successive loss in global species richness and were possibly related to intra-Triassic extinction events, environmental alterations and/or competition...|$|R

However, a number of engineering issues {{play a crucial role in}} the sustainable construction of high rise buildings. Non linear deformation of concrete has an adverse impact on high-rise buildings with complex geometries, due to differential <b>axial</b> <b>shortening.</b> These adverse effects are caused by time dependent behaviour resulting in volume change known as ‘shrinkage’, ‘creep’ and ‘elastic’ deformation. These three phenomena govern the behaviour and performance of all concrete elements, during and after construction. Reinforcement content, variable concrete modulus, volume to surface area ratio of the elements, environmental conditions, and construction quality and sequence influence on the performance of concrete elements and differential <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> will occur in all structural systems. Its detrimental effects escalate with increasing height and non vertical load paths resulting from geometric complexity. The magnitude of these effects has a significant impact on building envelopes, building services, secondary systems, and lifetime serviceability and performance. Analytical and test procedures available to quantify the magnitude of these effects are limited to a very few parameters and are not adequately rigorous to capture the complexity of true time dependent material response. With this in mind, a research project has been undertaken to develop an accurate numerical procedure to quantify the differential <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> of structural elements. The procedure has been successfully applied to quantify the differential <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> of a high rise building, and the important capabilities available in the procedure have been discussed. A new practical concept, based on the variation of vibration characteristic of structure during and after construction and used to quantify the <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> and assess the performance of structure, is presented...|$|E
40|$|As {{buildings}} inevitably {{increase in}} height, vertical support elements (e. g. columns and shear walls) in tall buildings {{are required to}} carry vertical load increments {{from a number of}} floors. Therefore, <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> of vertical elements due to long term creep and shrinkage effects is inevitable in reinforced concrete buildings. However, the calculation of reliable values for <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> is not a straight forward task. All parameters may be uncertain or may not be available at the design stage. Recently, engineers have also become concerned with differential shortening of adjacent vertical elements, particularly in the lower and basement levels of super high rise structures. Largely varied values and rates for <b>axial</b> <b>shortening</b> of adjacent support elements is not only a concern for vertical deformation, but can critically impact on the performance of horizontal structural elements such as beams and slabs. This research aims to develop a robust possibility-based differential shortening prediction framework, and associated risk distribution profiles, which overcomes the deficiencies in the current models for predicting axial column shortening in reinforced concrete high rise buildings.

40|$|Experimental results {{obtained}} on four {{carbon fiber composite}} stiffened curved panels subjected to static and cyclic compression and shear loadings are discussed. Two of the four panels presented an initial delamination obtained with Teflon inserts between stringers and skin. Panels were assembled in two closed boxes using flat aluminum plates. This solution allows the application of shear on each panel by applying torque on the box. The first box was obtained using undamaged panels, while the second one assembling damaged panels. Results are {{described in terms of}} <b>axial</b> load vs. <b>shortening</b> curve, torque vs. rotation curve, deformed shape and strain measurements. Boxes were subjected to a cyclic post-buckling torque, allowing the investigation of the effect of cyclic buckling in terms of global and local behavior. The obtained results show that this kind of structures can well work in the post-buckling field even if during their operative life the buckling load is reached thousands of times. ...|$|R

Patients and methods: Fourteen patients under 80 {{years of age}} with glaucoma, were enrolled. The choroid was imaged using prototypical high-penetration optic coherence tomography (OCT) and the thickness was measured. Axial length, choroidal thickness, and intraocular pressure (IOP) were measured bilaterally at 3 pm 1 day before and 6 days after trabeculectomy. The choroidal thickness was measured at the fovea and four other locations (2 mm superior, temporal, inferior, and nasal {{to the center of}} the optic nerve head). Results: The IOP and axial length significantly decreased in eyes that underwent trabeculectomy (P < 0. 0001 for the IOP; P < 0. 001 for axial length comparisons). The mean choroidal thicknesses significantly increased in eyes that underwent trabeculectomy compared to preoperatively (P < 0. 0001 for the fovea; P < 0. 01 for four locations around the optic disc). The mean magnitude of change in IOP was correlated positively with the mean magnitude of change in axial length, but not correlated with the mean magnitude of change in choroidal thickness at the fovea that underwent trabeculectomy. The sum of the axial length and subfoveal choroidal thickness in eyes decreased significantly postoperatively (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: The <b>axial</b> length <b>shortened,</b> the choroid thickened, and the sum of the axial length and subfoveal choroidal thickness decreased with IOP reduction early after trabeculectomy.

40|$|Residual {{function}} of the left ventricle was assessed in 25 patients with mitral stenosis and a normal left ventriculogram. The post-extrasystolic beat (R 2) in sinus rhythm (nine patients) and the first beat after an early beat (R 2) in atrial fibrillation (16 patients) were analysed angiocardiographically. Five subjects with a normal heart (controls) were also studied. The results are expressed as percentage changes in left ventricular contractility from the beat preceding the extra beat (R 1) to the beat R 2. In the control group the mean changes from R 1 to R 2 were: end diastolic volume + 68. 3 % (increase), end systolic volume - 21. 7 % (decrease), ejection fraction + 36. 2 %, mean systolic ejection rate + 22. 1 %, and mean velocity of circumferential fibre shortening + 31 %. A significant increase in proportional systolic shortening of all left ventricular axes was found in R 2 compared with R 1. In five patients with sinus rhythm and nine with atrial fibrillation the results fell within the normal range. In the remaining patients the beat R 2 indicated signs of poor left ventricular function. The mean changes from R 1 to R 2 in the patients with sinus rhythm and those with atrial fibrillation were respectively: end diastolic volume + 47. 8 % and + 36. 6 %, end systolic volume + 20 % and + 27 %, ejection fraction + 12. 5 % and + 6. 2 %, mean systolic ejection rate - 23. 3 % and - 30. 2 %, and mean velocity of circumferential fibre shortening - 25. 5 % and - 39. 2 %. The increase in the left ventricular <b>axial</b> systolic <b>shortening</b> was not significant. Thus analysing a post-extrasystolic beat in sinus rhythm of the beat following an early beat with a long diastole in atrial fibrillation is a valuable method of determining the residual function in patients with mitral stenosis who have a normal left ventriculogram in basic rhythm...|$|R
