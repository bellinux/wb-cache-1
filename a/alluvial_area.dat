40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. One unique advantage of ERTS imagery for delineating soil associations {{is the large}} area that can be scanned with one photo. Although soil associations usually are published at scales of 1 : 500, 000 or 1 : 1, 000, 000, the delineations are drawn on much larger scale maps covering small pieces of the scene and then pieced together. <b>Alluvial</b> <b>areas</b> are usually swollen {{out of proportion to}} other soil areas. ERTS imagery puts <b>alluvial</b> <b>areas</b> into their proper size. A second feature of ERTS imagery is that a soil association map constructed with its aid assures that the cartographic level of the associations is more nearly the same. Another advantage of ERTS imagery is that the actual shape and configuration of soil associations are apparent. Also with ERTS imagery significant new delineations may become apparent which were missed when constructing soil association maps from conventional large scale photos...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of six {{boreholes}} {{drilled in}} {{the lower part of}} the Bagnoli coastal plain permitted the reconstruction of its morphological evolution, consisting in three main phases. The first one is limited upward by a pomiceous level related to the Plinian eruption of Agnano-Monte Spina, 4400 yr BP; it is characterised by an <b>alluvial</b> <b>area</b> landward and a coarse sandy beach seaward. The second phase is represented by lagoon environments, as testified by many peat levels, increasingly recent towards northwest; their age ranges from 3700 +/- 55 to 1850 +/- 50 yr BP. The last phase is mainly characterised by coastal dune ridges, and subordinately by an <b>alluvial</b> <b>area</b> landward. The reconstruction of stratigraphic architecture shows that an important phenomenon occurred during the second phase. In fact, the peats are deposited at sea level or slightly above; by contrast, the data from boreholes indicate a depth range from 7. 7 to 1. 3 m b. s. l. This condition suggests a ground displacement, well known in the Phlegrean Fields since Roman times, and interpreted as bradyseismic movements. Subsidence mean rate, considering also the sea level changes, is here estimated around 4 - 5 m from 3700 to 1850 yr BP. These latter data, previously unknown, as well as the identification in this area of bradyseismic phenomena, already defined only in Pozzuoli and its suburbs and recently in the western area, provide interesting new details in the evolution of this volcano-tectonic coastal plain...|$|E

30|$|Surat is a {{historical}} coastal city located {{on the bank of}} the Tapi River, Gujarat state. The Surat port was an active hub of trade and commerce in the past, and the city reached its utmost prosperity during the sixteenth and seventeenth century. Surat was also the main port of the Mughal Empire (Gupta 1987). The British East India Company established one of its first Indian factories at Surat in 1612, and this English factory has been called the cornerstone of the British Empire in India (Rawlinson 1920). The colonial past of the city resulted in providing well-documented past flooding events in the city. Imperial Gazetteers and written historical accounts documented details of the past floods prior to the instrumental records (Kale et al. 1996). The construction of an inner wall in the city was commenced by the British in the year 1664 as a flood protection structure with gates that were closed in the event of a flood, and the construction of the entire wall was completed in the year 1707. The city area expanded from 8.12  km 2 (prior to 1961) to 326.5  km 2 in 2009 (SMC 2011). The city can be divided geomorphologically into a coastal zone and an <b>alluvial</b> <b>area.</b> The coastal zone is composed of marshy shoreline with an extensive tidal flat stretch intercepted by estuaries. The <b>alluvial</b> <b>area</b> is marked by alluvial deposits from the Tapi River (Patel et al. 2017). Flooding occurs in the city when there is a sudden release of water from the Ukai dam (constructed in 1972) which is located 100  km away from the city. Floods can also be caused by seawater intrusion through different creeks which are also known as Khadi floods, less devastating than the Ukai floods though it significantly affects the vulnerable households along these creeks (Bahinipati et al. 2015). The city population has grown tenfold since 1951, and the municipal area has increased from 8.1  km 2 in 1951 to 327  km 2 recently (Bhat et al. 2013). The population was 5.9 million in 2016 and is projected to be 8.6 million in 2030 (UNDESA 2016), which shows more vulnerability in the near future.|$|E

40|$|Water {{situation}} in Gujarat Water shortage and crisis {{is one of}} the environmental degradation in Gujarat. Except some parts of South Gujarat, rest of the Gujarat frequently experiences not only the drought, but ingress of salinity in all over the coastal area starting from Kutch to Bulsar. All villages located on coastal area of around 10 to 15 kms. are experience increasing of salinity everyday not only due to ingress of sea level, but more and more limestone are extracted from the deepest level of land, on the other hand more and more land comes under the irrigated agriculture which boosted the extraction of under ground water. It is a general belief that the water shortage of Gujarat is caused by nature, which is not true. In spite of the low and erratic rainfall, the combination of climate, physiographic and geology in different regions of the state did provide somewhat favorable conditions for water resources in most regions of the state about three decades ago (Hirway and Patel 1994 p. 44).

40|$|Kachchh {{region of}} India is a rift basin filled with sediments from Jurassic to Quaternary ages. This area is tectonically active and {{witnessed}} several major earthquakes since the recent historical past. During an earthquake event, the water-laden foundation soil liquefies and causes {{damage to buildings}} and other civil engineering structures. The January 26, 2001, Bhuj earthquake demonstrated extensive liquefaction-related damages in entire Kachchh Peninsula. Therefore, evaluation of liquefaction susceptibility of unconsolidated sediments is a vital requirement for developing seismic microzonation maps. In this paper, a new approach involving remote sensing techniques and geotechnical procedures is demonstrated for effective mapping of liquefaction-susceptible areas. The present and paleo-alluvial areas representing unconsolidated sediments were mapped using Landsat-TM data and field reflectance spectra. Spectral discrimination of <b>alluvial</b> <b>area</b> was made using the feature-oriented principal component selection and spectral angle mapping techniques. Subsequently, field geotechnical investigations were carried out in these areas. It {{is evident from the}} results that the alluvial soils are predominantly sandy loam with very low (7 - 28) standard penetration test values. The evaluated factor of safety for these soils varies from 0. 43 to 1. 7 for a peak ground acceleration of 0. 38. Finally, a liquefaction susceptibility map is prepared by integrating results on alluvium distribution, factor of safety, and depth to water table...|$|E
40|$|Vulsini Volcanic {{district}} in Northern Latium (Central Italy) {{is characterized by}} high natural radiation background resulting from the high concentrations of uranium, thorium and potassium in the volcanic products. In order to estimate the radon radiation risk, a series of soil gas radon measurements were carried out in Bolsena, the principal urban settlement in this area NE of Rome. Soil gas radon concentration ranges between 7 and 176 kBq/m 3 indicating a large degree of variability in the NORM content and behavior of the parent soil material related in particular to the occurrence of two different lithologies. Soil gas radon mapping confirmed the existence of two different areas: one along the shoreline of the Bolsena lake, characterized by low soil radon level, due to a prevailing alluvial lithology; another close to the Bolsena village with high soil radon level due {{to the presence of}} the high radioactive volcanic rocks of the Vulsini volcanic district. Radon risk assessment, based on soil gas radon and permeability data, results in a map where the <b>alluvial</b> <b>area</b> is characterized by a probability to be an area with high Radon Index lower than 20 %, while probabilities higher than 30 % and also above 50 % are found close to the Bolsena village.
