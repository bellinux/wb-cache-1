5|$|Even {{though the}} {{boundary}} event was severe, there was significant {{variability in the}} rate of extinction between and within different clades. Species that depended on photosynthesis declined or became extinct as <b>atmospheric</b> <b>particles</b> blocked sunlight and reduced the solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth. This plant extinction caused a major reshuffling of the dominant plant groups. Omnivores, insectivores, and carrion-eaters survived the extinction event, perhaps because of the increased availability of their food sources. No purely herbivorous or carnivorous mammals seem to have survived. Rather, the surviving mammals and birds fed on insects, worms, and snails, which in turn fed on dead plant and animal matter. Scientists hypothesize that these organisms survived the collapse of plant-based food chains because they fed on detritus (non-living organic material).|$|E

40|$|Sulphuric acid {{is a key}} {{component}} in <b>atmospheric</b> new <b>particle</b> formation. However, sulphuric acid alone does not form stable enough clusters to initiate <b>particle</b> formation in <b>atmospheric</b> conditions. Strong bases, such as amines, have been suggested to stabilize sulphuric acid clusters and thus participate in particle formation. We modelled the formation rate of clusters with two sulphuric acid and two amine molecules (JA 2 B 2 ) at varying atmospherically relevant conditions with respect to concentrations of sulphuric acid ([H 2 SO 4 ]), dimethylamine ([DMA]) and trimethylamine ([TMA]), temperature and relative humidity (RH). The modelled formation rates JA 2 B 2 were functions of sulphuric acid concentration with close to quadratic dependence, which is in good agreement with atmospheric observations {{of the connection between}} the particle formation rate and sulphuric acid concentration. The coefficients KA 2 B 2 connecting the cluster formation rate and sulphuric acid concentrations as JA 2 B 2 = KA 2 B 2 [H 2 SO 4 ] 2 turned out to depend also on amine concentrations, temperature and relative humidity. We tested how the model results change if the clusters with two sulphuric acid and two amine molecules are assumed to act as seeds for heterogeneous nucleation of organic vapours (other than amines) with higher atmospheric concentrations than sulphuric acid. We also compared the modelled coefficients KA 2 B 2 with the corresponding coefficients calculated from the atmospheric observations (Kobs) from environments with varying temperatures and levels of anthropogenic influence. By taking into account the modelled behaviour of JA 2 B 2 as a function of [H 2 SO 4 ], temperature and RH, the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>particle</b> formation rate was reproduced more closely than with the traditional semi-empirical formulae based on sulphuric acid concentration only. The formation rates of clusters with two sulphuric acid and two amine molecules with different amine compositions (DMA or TMA or one of both) had different responses to varying meteorological conditions and concentrations of vapours participating to particle formation. The observed inverse proportionality of the coefficient Kobs with RH and temperature agreed best with the modelled coefficient KA 2 B 2 related to formation of a~cluster with two H 2 SO 4 and one or two TMA molecules, assuming that these clusters can grow in collisions with abundant organic vapour molecules. In case this assumption is valid, our results suggest that the formation rate of clusters with at least two of both sulphuric acid and amine molecules might be the rate-limiting step for <b>atmospheric</b> <b>particle</b> formation. More generally, our analysis elucidates the sensitivity of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>particle</b> formation rate to meteorological variables and concentrations of vapours participating in particle formation (also other than H 2 SO 4 ) ...|$|R

To provide meaningful results in such unfavorable conditions we have developed a new flexible signal processing method based on a two-primitive model fitting the spectrum of the Doppler return.
