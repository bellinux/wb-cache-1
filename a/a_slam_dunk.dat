In more recent games, the street basketball modes are titled Blacktop and MyPark. Blacktop is structured in the typical style of street basketball. MyPark consists of an open area filled with players who can join different games on different courts.

25|$|Divac had {{an unusual}} style {{compared}} to most other centers of his generation: despite his height, he possessed good mobility, had good {{control of the}} ball, and was a decent shooter. On occasion, he would also act as a play maker. His trademark moves included a mid-range shot {{at the top of}} the key and flip shots around the rim, while facing the complete opposite direction. His quirky moves complemented how he liked playing gags on the court: in the 1989 EuroBasket, he lifted teammate Zoran Radović for <b>a</b> <b>slam</b> <b>dunk.</b> In just four professional seasons in Europe, he became the most sought-after big man on the continent, after Arvydas Sabonis.|$|E
25|$|To {{begin the}} second half, Kelser made a shot six {{feet from the}} basket. Including those two points, the Spartans scored seven {{consecutive}} points to bring their lead to 16. Donnelly contributed four straight field goals as the Spartans' lead climbed to 50–34. Indiana State began to rally at this point, with two made field goal attempts each for Bird and Bob Heaton. While Michigan State's lead remained around 10 points, Kelser's foul troubles worsened when he committed his fourth of the game 4:27 into the second half. Michigan State was forced to remove him for reserve Jay Vincent, who was suffering from a foot bruise. In 19 overall minutes of playing time, Vincent had four fouls himself. Indiana State focused on playing close to the opposing basket while Kelser {{was out of the}} game, and Bird keyed a Sycamores scoring run with two field goals and a free throw. With 10:05 remaining, the Spartans' lead had been cut to 52–46. Kelser was brought into the game in response to the run, and did not commit another foul until the end. He and Johnson were responsible for the next eight points scored by the Spartans. The run included a four-point play by Johnson; he had <b>a</b> <b>slam</b> <b>dunk</b> while being fouled by Heaton, and sank two free throws that were awarded because Heaton was judged to have undercut him. For the last five minutes of the game, the Spartans held the ball for long periods to burn time off the clock. Bird received a technical foul call for one play in which he illegally stole the ball from Johnson while he was attempting an inbounds pass and attempted to score. Behind an offense that missed only 4 of 16 second half field goal attempts, Michigan State clinched its first men's basketball national championship by a 75–64 final score. Johnson was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, having scored 53 points on 17-of-25 shooting during the Final Four.|$|E

500|$|He {{is known}} as the type of player likely to get <b>a</b> <b>slam</b> <b>dunk</b> if he gets the ball near the rim.

500|$|Chamberlain's {{impact on}} the game is also {{reflected}} {{in the fact that}} he was directly responsible for several rule changes in the NBA, including widening the lane to try to keep him farther away from the hoop, instituting offensive goaltending and revising rules governing inbounding the ball and shooting free throws (such as making it against the rules to inbound the ball over the backboard). Chamberlain, who reportedly had a 50-inch vertical leap, was physically capable of converting foul shots via <b>a</b> <b>slam</b> <b>dunk</b> without a running start (beginning his movement at the top of the key). When his dunks practically undermined the difficulty of a foul shot, both the NCAA and the NBA banned his modus operandi. In basketball history, pundits have stated that the only other player who forced such a massive change of rules is 6'10" [...] Minneapolis Lakers center George Mikan, who played a decade before Chamberlain and also caused many rule changes designed to thwart so-called [...] "big men".|$|E

500|$|On December 3, 1956, Chamberlain {{made his}} varsity debut. In his first varsity game the center scored 52 points and grabbed 31 rebounds, {{breaking}} both all-time Kansas records in an 87–69 win against the Northwestern team of future NBA teammate Joe Ruklick. Teammate Monte Johnson testified to his athleticism: [...] "Wilt ... had unbelievable endurance and speed ... {{and was never}} tired. When he dunked, he was so fast {{that a lot of}} players got their fingers jammed [...]" [...] Reportedly, Chamberlain also broke Johnny Kerr's toe with <b>a</b> <b>slam</b> <b>dunk.</b> By this time, Chamberlain had developed several offensive weapons that became his trademarks: his finger roll, his fade-away jump shot, which he could also hit as a bank shot, his passing and his shot-blocking. Leading a talented squad of starters, including Maurice King, Gene Elstun, John Parker, Ron Lonesky and Lew Johnson, the Jayhawks went 13–1 until they lost a game 56–54 versus Oklahoma State, who held the ball the last three and a half minutes without any intention of scoring a basket, which was still possible {{in the days before the}} shot clock (introduced 1984 in the NCAA). As he did at Overbrook, Chamberlain again showcased his diverse athletic talent. He ran the 100-yard dash in 10.9seconds, shot-putted 56feet, triple jumped more than 50feet, and won the high jump in the Big Eight track and field championships three straight years.|$|E

2500|$|The {{game was}} played at Rupp Arena, {{in front of a}} crowd of 23,124 spectators. The Wildcats opened the scoring early in the first half.

The Hoyas' David Wingate evened the score with a successful jump shot. The teams then traded baskets; <b>a</b> <b>slam</b> <b>dunk</b> by McClain was followed by another jump shot by Wingate. Villanova made their first four field goal attempts, but fell behind 10–8 as they committed four turnovers during the period. Georgetown played a 1–3–1 defense focused on trapping and pressuring the Wildcats' players, while Villanova used a match-up zone defense. With about 16 minutes elapsed in the first half, the Hoyas held a one-point advantage. Ewing responded by scoring on dunks on each of Georgetown's following three possessions. The Hoyas were unable to extend their lead, however, because Villanova found success on long field goal attempts. Three Wildcats players scored on long-range jumpers, including a shot by Pressley that fell after hitting the rim multiple times. The Wildcats employed a [...] "patient" [...] offensive strategy during the game, which was in evidence during the last two minutes of the first half as Pinckney, with two personal fouls, was not on the floor.
