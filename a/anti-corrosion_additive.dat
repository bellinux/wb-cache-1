50|$|MW 50 is {{something}} of a misnomer, as it is actually a mixture of three fluids: 50% methanol acting primarily to achieve optimum anti-detonant effect, secondarily as an anti-freeze; 49.5% water; and 0.5% Schutzöl 39, an oil-based <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>additive.</b> The similar MW 30 increased the water to 69.5% and decreased methanol to 30%. This increased the cooling performance but made it easier to freeze, the mixture intended to be used for lower-altitude missions. EW 30 and EW 50 mixtures also existed, which substituted methanol with ethanol; in emergency, pure water could be used.|$|E
50|$|Systems with a rapid {{starting}} cadenza {{may include}} water circulation to external heat exchangers. In such cases anti-freeze and <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>additives</b> {{must be carefully}} chosen to not change the resistance or support the growth of algae or bacteria.|$|R
50|$|Distilled {{water is}} {{preferable}} to tap water for use in automotive cooling systems. The minerals and ions typically found in tap water can be corrosive to internal engine components, and can cause a faster depletion of the <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>additives</b> found in most antifreeze formulations.|$|R
50|$|To avoid frost damage, the hopper {{could be}} drained easily {{through a large}} brass tap. This would be done regularly, {{sometimes}} after every use, to avoid rust inside the hopper. As the cooling water evaporated continuously when running, no anti-freeze or <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>additives</b> were used.|$|R
5000|$|Core plugs {{can often}} {{be a source of}} leaks due to {{corrosion}} caused by cooling system water. Although modern antifreeze chemicals do not evaporate and may be considered [...] "permanent", <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>additives</b> gradually deplete and must be replenished. Failure to do this periodic maintenance accelerates corrosion of engine parts, and the thin metal core plugs are often the first components to start leaking.|$|R
50|$|Modern designs use {{stainless}} steel electrodes, and sodium carbonate, or other salts, {{and do not}} use the container as one electrode. In some designs the electrodes are fixed and the liquid is raised and lowered by an external cylinder or pump. Motor start systems with a rapid starting cadenza may include water circulation to external heat exchangers. In such cases anti-freeze and <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>additives</b> must be carefully chosen to not change the resistance or support the growth of algae or bacteria.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a comparative estimation of technological capabilities of domestic polymer quenchants with different chemical composition such as UZSP- 1, Kamgidrol-ZAK and Acresol. The influence of polymer concentration on cooling ability is presented. Intervals of working temperatures for each quenchant were defined {{and the influence}} of industrial pollution on the cooling ability was estimated. The paper makes evaluation of the operational stability and the effect of <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>additives</b> on the cooling ability of each to the quenching medium. There are practical recommendations on application of quenchants in the industry...|$|R
40|$|Usage of {{combustion}} {{processes for}} production of target products is less common than {{the application of}} catalytic processes. However, there are known examples of production of carbon black, HCl, TiO 2 etc. Some research work was done at the Institute of Combustion Problems (Almaty, Kazakhstan) consider the synthesis in flame of carbon nanomaterials: fullerenes, nanotubes and soot nanobeads with superhydrophobic surface. An alternative of fullerenes and nanotubes synthesis in arc discharge of graphite is the method using stationary hydrocarbon flames. Flame is a self-sustaining {{system in which the}} hydrocarbons can be precursors of carbon nanomaterials, and the heat released during combustion, is a parameters of the process control. It is known that PAH are nucleation centers of forming soot i. e. PAH can be converted into either soot or fullerenes. The formation of CNTs occurs in diffusion flames from the fuel side and is initiated by transition metals particles. The paper presents data on the formation of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes as well as soot with the superhydrophobic surface, obtained on nickel and silicon supports in benzene-oxygen and propane-oxygen diffusion flames. New results regarding the synthesis of superhydrophobic surface with a contact angle 135 - 175 ° have great practical interest as <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>additives</b> to various materials. Fullerenes and Their Formation in th...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} work {{was based on}} the effect of additives on the performance of engine oil. This performance which {{is a function of the}} properties include viscosity, density, flash point, colour as well as foaming ability/stability. The additives whose effects were investigated in this {{research work}} were B 023233 (comprising of anti-oxidant, detergent, dispersant, pour point depressant, <b>anti-corrosion</b> and anti-rust <b>additives)</b> and B 23333 which is the viscosity modifier additive. All the laboratory tests carried out were in accordance with the specification of the American Society for testing and materials (ASTM). The results of the tests obtained from the blend show that the properties- viscosity, density, flash point, increases with increase in additive concentration, while that of the foaming ability decreases as the concentration of the additive increases...|$|R
