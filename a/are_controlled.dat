Directly-controlled state schools generally have a predominantly Protestant intake.|$|E
5|$|Autonomous {{underwater}} vehicles (AUVs) and {{remotely operated}} underwater vehicles (ROVs) can carry out some functions of divers. They can be deployed at greater depths and in more dangerous environments. An AUV is a robot which travels underwater without requiring real-time input from an operator. AUVs constitute {{part of a}} larger group of unmanned undersea systems, a classification that includes non-autonomous ROVs, which <b>are</b> <b>controlled</b> and powered from the surface by an operator/pilot via an umbilical or using remote control. In military applications AUVs are often referred to as unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs).|$|E

5|$|Biology {{has largely}} {{rejected}} the idea that evolution is guided in any way, but the evolution of some features is indeed facilitated by the genes of the developmental-genetic toolkit studied in evolutionary developmental biology. An example {{is the development of}} wing pattern in some species of Heliconius butterfly, which have independently evolved similar patterns. These butterflies are Müllerian mimics of each other, so natural selection is the driving force, but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, <b>are</b> <b>controlled</b> by the same genes.|$|E
5|$|Evolve uses an {{asymmetrical}} multiplayer structure, where five players—four {{playing as}} hunters and one as the monster—battle {{against each other}} on an industrialized alien planet called Shear. The hunters' gameplay {{is based on the}} first-person shooter design, while the monsters <b>are</b> <b>controlled</b> from a third-person perspective. The hunters' goal is to eliminate the monster, while the monster's goal is to consume wildlife and evolve to make themselves stronger. The game can be played alone or with multiple players.|$|E

The development of inner ear structures such as the cochlea is regulated by Dlx5/Dlx6, Otx1/Otx2 and Pax2, which in turn <b>are</b> <b>controlled</b> by the master gene Shh. Shh is secreted by the notochord.|$|E
5|$|Mother-of-pearl or nacre is the {{naturally}} occurring lustrous layer that lines some mollusc shells. It {{is used to}} make pearl buttons and in artisan craftwork to make organic jewellery.

5|$|Several {{different}} {{habitat types}} {{are found in}} Ireland, including farmland, open woodland, temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, conifer plantations, peat bogs {{and a variety of}} coastal habitats. However, agriculture drives current land use patterns in Ireland, limiting natural habitat preserves, particularly for larger wild mammals with greater territorial needs.

5|$|The Last of Us is an action-adventure {{survival}} horror {{game played}} from a third-person perspective.

Players use firearms, improvised weapons, and stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. For most of the game, players control Joel, a man tasked with escorting a young girl, Ellie, across the United States; Ellie and other companions <b>are</b> <b>controlled</b> by the artificial intelligence. Players also control Ellie throughout the game's winter segment.|$|E
