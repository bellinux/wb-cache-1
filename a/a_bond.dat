50|$|<b>A</b> {{covalent}} <b>bond</b> {{can also}} be <b>a</b> double <b>bond</b> or <b>a</b> triple <b>bond.</b> <b>A</b> single <b>bond</b> is weaker than either <b>a</b> double <b>bond</b> or <b>a</b> triple <b>bond.</b> This difference in strength {{can be explained by}} examining the component bonds of which each of these types of covalent bonds consists (Moore, Stanitski, and Jurs 393).|$|R
50|$|Typically, <b>a</b> single <b>bond</b> is <b>a</b> sigma <b>bond</b> while <b>a</b> {{multiple}} <b>bond</b> {{is composed}} of one sigma bond together with pi or other <b>bonds.</b> <b>A</b> double <b>bond</b> has one sigma plus one pi <b>bond,</b> and <b>a</b> triple <b>bond</b> has one sigma plus two pi bonds.|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} {{relates to}} {{a method for}} determining <b>a</b> <b>bonding</b> connection (1) in a component arrangement (2), wherein the method has the following steps: producing <b>a</b> <b>bonding</b> connection (1) between <b>a</b> <b>bonding</b> section (3) of <b>a</b> <b>bonding</b> wire (4) and a metallic contact point (5), structuring a top-side surface of the bonding wire (4) {{in the region of}} the bonding section (3) and determining the bonding connection (1), wherein in this case a test voltage is applied to the bonding wire (4) and the bonding connection (1) so that the bonding connection (1) heats up owing to the current flow, generating a thermogram for the heated bonding connection (1) and determining whether the bonding connection (1) has been produced correctly by evaluating the thermogram. Furthermore, the application relates to a test apparatus for determining <b>a</b> <b>bonding</b> connection (1) in a component arrangement (2) ...|$|R
5|$|Based on {{computer}} simulations, {{the distance of}} the divalent carbon atom to its neighbours is claimed to be 138 picometers with <b>a</b> <b>bond</b> angle of 158.8°. The planes of the phenyl groups are almost at right angles to each other (the dihedral angle being 85.7°).|$|E
5|$|Charles Gray {{was cast}} as villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld, after playing <b>a</b> <b>Bond</b> ally named Dikko Henderson in You Only Live Twice (1967). David Bauer, who plays Morton Slumber, had also {{previously}} appeared in that film, uncredited, as an American diplomat.|$|E
5|$|Its removal was {{complicated}} {{due to its}} sinking upon {{the site of the}} Holland Tunnel, which was under construction. It remained submerged there until 13 February 1927, when it was raised and determined to be a total loss. <b>A</b> <b>bond</b> was issued for its replacement.|$|E
25|$|With <b>an</b> affectional <b>bond,</b> neither {{partner is}} limerent. With <b>a</b> Limerent-Nonlimerent <b>bond,</b> one partner is limerent. In <b>a</b> Limerent-Limerent <b>bond,</b> both {{partners}} are limerent.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>Bonded</b> {{logistics}} park {{is a type}} {{of special}} economic zone. Trade arrangements are similar to that of <b>a</b> <b>bonded</b> warehouse but over a specific geographic area. Sometimes with international port capabilities. [...] Goods may be stored, manipulated, or undergo manufacturing operations without payment of duty.|$|R
25|$|Like <b>a</b> single {{covalent}} <b>bond,</b> double bonds can {{be described}} in terms of overlapping atomic orbitals, except that, unlike <b>a</b> single <b>bond</b> (which consists of <b>a</b> single sigma <b>bond),</b> <b>a</b> carbon–carbon double <b>bond</b> consists of one sigma bond and one pi bond. This double bond is stronger than <b>a</b> single covalent <b>bond</b> (611kJ/mol for C=C vs. 347kJ/mol for C–C) and also shorter, with <b>an</b> average <b>bond</b> length of 1.33 ångströms (133 pm).|$|R

5|$|According to {{continuation}} Bond author Raymond Benson, {{there was}} {{further development of}} the Bond character in Thunderball, with glimpses of both his sense of humour and his own sense of mortality being shown. Felix Leiter had his largest role to date in <b>a</b> <b>Bond</b> story and much of his humour came though, whilst his incapacity, suffered in Live and Let Die, had not led to bitterness or to his being unable to join in with the underwater fight scene {{towards the end of}} the novel.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> {{chemical}} <b>bond</b> can be <b>a</b> covalent <b>bond,</b> <b>an</b> ionic <b>bond,</b> <b>a</b> hydrogen <b>bond</b> or {{just because}} of Van der Waals force. Each {{of these kinds of}} bonds is ascribed to some potential. These potentials create the interactions which hold atoms together in molecules or crystals. In many simple compounds, valence bond theory, the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion model (VSEPR), and the concept of oxidation number can be used to explain molecular structure and composition.|$|R
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the bond’s life {{we often}} see a pull-to-parity effect. As {{maturity}} approaches, <b>a</b> <b>bond’s</b> price converges to its nominal amount, irrespective of the level of interest rates, and this may cause <b>a</b> <b>bond’s</b> price to move in a different way to what would normally be expected.|$|R
5|$|After a 1994 {{plan was}} {{approved}} and <b>a</b> <b>bond</b> issue passed, additional elementary magnet schools were opened and district attendance plans redrawn, {{which resulted in}} the Topeka schools meeting court standards of racial balance by 1998. Unified status was eventually granted to Topeka Unified School District No. 501 on July 27, 1999. One of the new magnet schools is named after the Scott family attorneys for their role in the Brown case and civil rights.|$|E

5|$|Clark’s direct {{superior}} {{while working}} at SAC was the Governor of Hokkaido (and future Prime Minister of Japan) Kuroda Kiyotaka. The two men greatly respected one another and shared <b>a</b> <b>bond</b> in that they both had past military experience. Their positive relationship facilitated Clark’s many accomplishments while in Sapporo and accounted for the wide latitude Clark was given in implementing not just SAC programs, but also his influence on the colonial development of Hokkaido.|$|E

After {{pleading}} guilty to larceny, he was sentenced on May 12 to three years' imprisonment. On May 16 he was sent to the state prison in McAlester 59 miles (95km) away, which according to the Ledger probably saved his life.|$|E
5|$|Gladstone {{is served}} by the Gladstone School District, which {{includes}} John Wetten Elementary School, Kraxberger Middle School, and Gladstone High School. In 2006, <b>a</b> <b>bond</b> was passed to allow approximately $40 million worth of construction on the three schools. The majority (approx. 26 million) of the money was applied towards a remodel of the high school. The district later refinanced the bond, saving taxpayers over 5 percent on its total ($805,040), with savings to begin in the 2024 tax year.|$|E

He then moved to BancOhio National Bank, a regional bank in Columbus, Ohio, that was acquired in 1984 by National City Bank. Corzine worked at BancOhio until 1975 when he moved his family to New Jersey and was hired as <b>a</b> <b>bond</b> trader for Goldman Sachs.|$|E

5|$|Initially the screenwriter {{was to be}} Harold Jack Bloom, {{although}} he was later replaced by Roald Dahl, who had little previous screenwriting experience.
