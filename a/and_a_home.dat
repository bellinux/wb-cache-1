5|$|In 1891, Lowe tied a then {{major league}} record with six hits (four singles, a double <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> run) in six at bats. Having played {{mostly in the}} outfield in 1891 and 1892, he {{replaced}} Joe Quinn at second base in 1893 and was the Beaneaters' starting second baseman for eight straight years, from 1893 to 1900.|$|E

After getting on base five times in the wildcard game against the Oakland A's, Hosmer also slammed a game-winning, two-run homer in Game 2 of the ALDS against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. In doing so, the first baseman became the first player in MLB history to hit both a triple <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> run during extra innings in one year's postseason.|$|E

5|$|Abebe {{returned}} to his homeland a hero. He was greeted by a large crowd, many dignitaries and {{the commander of the}} Imperial Guard, Brigadier-General Mengistu Neway. Abebe was paraded through the streets of Addis Ababa along a procession route lined with thousands of people and presented to Emperor Haile Selassie. The emperor awarded him the Star of Ethiopia and promoted him to the rank of asiraleqa (corporal). He was given the use of a chauffeur-driven Volkswagen Beetle (since he did not yet know how to drive) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>home,</b> both owned by the Guard.|$|E

Roles in Michael Mann's Miami Vice (2006), the adaptation of John Fante's Ask the Dust (2006), and Woody Allen's Cassandra's Dream (2007) followed, underscoring Farrell's popularity among Hollywood writers and directors; however, it was his role in Martin McDonagh's In Bruges (2008) that earned him a Hollywood Foreign Press Association Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.|$|E

5|$|In {{the field}} of 20th-century popular music, Baltimore first was a major center for the {{development}} of East Coast ragtime, producing the legendary performer and composer Eubie Blake. Later, Baltimore became a hotspot for jazz, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> for such legends in the field as Chick Webb and Billie Holiday. The city's jazz scene {{can be traced to the}} early part of the 20th century, when the style first spread across the country. Locally, Baltimore was home to a vibrant African American musical tradition, which included funereal processions, beginning with slow, mournful tunes and ending with lively ragtime numbers, very similar to the New Orleans music that gave rise to jazz.|$|E
5|$|Newspaper writers {{initially}} performed {{this function}} {{in the early days}} of Major League Baseball (MLB). As the importance of baseball player statistics increased, teams began to pressure writer-scorers for favorable scoring decisions for their players in games played at home stadiums, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> team scoring bias was perceived by many coaches, players, and writers. Controversies related to perceived bias or errors in scoring have led to questions about important baseball records, including several no-hitters and Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak of 1941. By 1979, many major newspapers decided to ban their writers from scoring baseball games due to conflict-of-interest concerns, and in 1980 MLB began to hire independent official scorers.|$|E
5|$|On 15 November 2004, Shaftesbury's Nice-based lawyer, Thierry Bensaude {{reported}} him missing, {{after being}} contacted by his girlfriend, Orche.

After not hearing from Shaftesbury in a week, they remained concerned when he failed {{to return to his}} rented flat in Adelaide Crescent, Hove. Bensaude and Orche both expressed fears for his safety. Shaftesbury had been taking legal action in relation to the theft of some family antiques and artwork. Some friends and acquaintances mentioned that he had complained of money problems, so they surmised that his disappearance may {{have had something to do}} with the theft and financial loss.|$|E

5|$|The Phillies began August {{by placing}} Cliff Lee on the {{disabled}} list, replacing him on the roster with Cesar Jimenez; however, David Buchanan was eventually expected to take Lee's place in the starting rotation. They continued their series with the Washington Nationals, winning 2–1 with another strong outing from Roberto Hernandez <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> run by Marlon Byrd. After wins in the series' first two games, starting pitcher A. J. Burnett was ejected {{in the second inning}} of the third game for arguing with home plate umpire Chris Guccione about the strike zone. Burnett's first ejection in his 16-season career sparked 11 runs by the Nationals, who shut out the Phillies. The team also lost the rubber match 4–0 the following day, when Cole Hamels had no run support in a pitchers' duel with Stephen Strasburg.|$|E
5|$|The {{community}} of Dartmouth {{lies on the}} east shore of Halifax Harbour, while Halifax is on the west shore. Halifax and Dartmouth had thrived during times of war; the harbour {{was one of the}} British Royal Navy's most important bases in North America, a centre for wartime trade, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> to privateers who harried the British Empire's enemies during the American Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812. The completion of the Intercolonial Railway and its Deep Water Terminal in 1880 allowed for increased steamship trade and led to accelerated development of the port area, but Halifax faced an economic downturn after the British garrison left the city in late 1905 and early 1906.|$|E
