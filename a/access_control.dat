In addition to this, over 5000 city policemen were deployed in various places, including the event venues and all the major hotels of the city. Strict anti-sabotage measures were taken to provide security at the athlete hotels. Also, a 24-hour <b>access</b> <b>control</b> system was placed, with sniffer dogs used to sanitise the area.|$|E
40|$|<b>Access</b> <b>controls</b> are {{mechanisms}} to enhance security by protecting data from unauthorized accesses. In contrast to traditional <b>access</b> <b>controls</b> that grant <b>access</b> rights at the granularity {{of the whole}} tables or views, fine-grained <b>access</b> <b>controls</b> specify <b>access</b> <b>controls</b> at finer granularity, e. g., individual nodes in XML databases and individual tuples in relational databases. While there is a voluminous literature on specifying and modeling fine-grained <b>access</b> <b>controls,</b> less {{work has been done}} to address the performance issues of database systems with fine-grained <b>access</b> <b>controls.</b> This thesis addresses the performance issues of fine-grained <b>access</b> <b>controls</b> and proposes corresponding solutions. In particular, the following issues are addressed: effective storage of massive <b>access</b> <b>controls,</b> efficient query planning for secure query evaluation, and accurate cardinality estimation for <b>access</b> <b>controlled</b> data. Because fine-grained <b>access</b> <b>controls</b> specify <b>access</b> rights from each user to each piece of data in the system, they are effectively a massive matrix of the size as the product of the number of users and the size of data. Therefore, fine-grained <b>access</b> <b>controls</b> require a very compact encoding to be feasible. The proposed storage system in this thesis achieves an unprecedented level of compactness by leveraging the high correlation of <b>access</b> <b>controls</b> found in real system data. This correlation comes from two sides: the structural similarity of access rights between data, and the similarity of access patterns from different users. This encoding can be embedded into a linearized representation of XML data such that a query evaluation framework is able to compute the answer to the <b>access</b> <b>controlled</b> query with minimal disk I/O to the <b>access</b> <b>controls.</b> Query optimization is a crucial component for database systems. This thesis proposes an intelligent query plan caching mechanism that has lower amortized cost for query planning in the presence of fine-grained <b>access</b> <b>controls.</b> The rationale behind this query plan caching mechanism is that the queries, customized by different <b>access</b> <b>controls</b> from different users, may share common upper-level join trees in their optimal query plans. Since join plan generation is an expensive step in query optimization, reusing the upper-level join trees will reduce query optimization significantly. The proposed caching mechanism is able to match efficient query plans to <b>access</b> <b>controlled</b> query plans with minimal runtime cost. In case of a query plan cache miss, the optimizer needs to optimize an <b>access</b> <b>controlled</b> query from scratch. This depends on accurate cardinality estimation {{on the size of the}} intermediate query results. This thesis proposes a novel sampling scheme that has better accuracy than traditional cardinality estimation techniques...|$|R

25|$|After a person, {{program or}} {{computer}} has successfully been identified and authenticated {{then it must}} be determined what informational resources they are permitted to access and what actions they {{will be allowed to}} perform (run, view, create, delete, or change).

The policies prescribe what information and computing services can be accessed, by whom, and under what conditions. The <b>access</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms are then configured to enforce these policies.
