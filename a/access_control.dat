In addition to this, over 5000 city policemen were deployed in various places, including the event venues and all the major hotels of the city. Strict anti-sabotage measures were taken to provide security at the athlete hotels. Also, a 24-hour <b>access</b> <b>control</b> system was placed, with sniffer dogs used to sanitise the area.|$|E
40|$|<b>Access</b> <b>controls</b> are {{mechanisms}} to enhance security by protecting data from unauthorized accesses. In contrast to traditional <b>access</b> <b>controls</b> that grant <b>access</b> rights at the granularity {{of the whole}} tables or views, fine-grained <b>access</b> <b>controls</b> specify <b>access</b> <b>controls</b> at finer granularity, e. g., individual nodes in XML databases and individual tuples in relational databases. While there is a voluminous literature on specifying and modeling fine-grained <b>access</b> <b>controls,</b> less {{work has been done}} to address the performance issues of database systems with fine-grained <b>access</b> <b>controls.</b> This thesis addresses the performance issues of fine-grained <b>access</b> <b>controls</b> and proposes corresponding solutions. In particular, the following issues are addressed: effective storage of massive <b>access</b> <b>controls,</b> efficient query planning for secure query evaluation, and accurate cardinality estimation for <b>access</b> <b>controlled</b> data. Because fine-grained <b>access</b> <b>controls</b> specify <b>access</b> rights from each user to each piece of data in the system, they are effectively a massive matrix of the size as the product of the number of users and the size of data. Therefore, fine-grained <b>access</b> <b>controls</b> require a very compact encoding to be feasible. The proposed storage system in this thesis achieves an unprecedented level of compactness by leveraging the high correlation of <b>access</b> <b>controls</b> found in real system data. This correlation comes from two sides: the structural similarity of access rights between data, and the similarity of access patterns from different users. This encoding can be embedded into a linearized representation of XML data such that a query evaluation framework is able to compute the answer to the <b>access</b> <b>controlled</b> query with minimal disk I/O to the <b>access</b> <b>controls.</b> Query optimization is a crucial component for database systems. This thesis proposes an intelligent query plan caching mechanism that has lower amortized cost for query planning in the presence of fine-grained <b>access</b> <b>controls.</b> The rationale behind this query plan caching mechanism is that the queries, customized by different <b>access</b> <b>controls</b> from different users, may share common upper-level join trees in their optimal query plans. Since join plan generation is an expensive step in query optimization, reusing the upper-level join trees will reduce query optimization significantly. The proposed caching mechanism is able to match efficient query plans to <b>access</b> <b>controlled</b> query plans with minimal runtime cost. In case of a query plan cache miss, the optimizer needs to optimize an <b>access</b> <b>controlled</b> query from scratch. This depends on accurate cardinality estimation {{on the size of the}} intermediate query results. This thesis proposes a novel sampling scheme that has better accuracy than traditional cardinality estimation techniques...|$|R

25|$|After a person, {{program or}} {{computer}} has successfully been identified and authenticated {{then it must}} be determined what informational resources they are permitted to access and what actions they {{will be allowed to}} perform (run, view, create, delete, or change). This is called authorization. Authorization to access information and other computing services begins with administrative policies and procedures. The policies prescribe what information and computing services can be accessed, by whom, and under what conditions. The <b>access</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms are then configured to enforce these policies. Different computing systems are equipped with different kinds of <b>access</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms—some may even offer a choice of different <b>access</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms.
