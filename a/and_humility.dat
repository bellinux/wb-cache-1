5|$|Not all of {{the monks}} were {{attracted}} by Symeon's zealous approach. Symeon attempted to reform the Byzantine monasteries, where monks had become subservient to the emperor and had acquired large holdings of property, libraries, and art. His writings and teachings were aimed at returning the monasteries to their traditional role in the early church, urging the monks {{to take up a}} life of simplicity, asceticism, purity of heart, and constant prayer. The strict monastic discipline for which Symeon aimed upset several monks in the monastery. Symeon also took a more emotional approach to worship, suggesting that a monk shouldn't take the sacrament without tears. The introduction of vegetarian meals, along with other unique practices to instill discipline <b>and</b> <b>humility,</b> also caused some displeasure among the monks.|$|E
40|$|Data {{from two}} studies {{describe}} {{the development of}} an implicit measure of <b>humility</b> <b>and</b> support the idea that dispositional humility is a positive quality with possible benefits. In Study 1, 135 college students completed <b>Humility</b> <b>and</b> Self-Esteem Implicit Association Tests (IATs) and several self-report measures of personality self-concept. Fifty-four participants also completed the Humility IAT again approximately 2 weeks later <b>and</b> their <b>humility</b> was rated by close acquaintances. The Humility IAT was found to be internally and temporally consistent. Implicit humility correlated with self-reported humility relative to arrogance, implicit self-esteem, <b>and</b> narcissism (inversely). <b>Humility</b> was not associated with self-reported low self-esteem, pessimism, or depression. In fact, self-reported humility relative to arrogance correlated positively with self-reported self-esteem, gratitude, forgiveness, spirituality, and general health. In addition, self-reported <b>humility</b> <b>and</b> acquaintance-rated <b>humility</b> correlated positively; however, implicit <b>humility</b> <b>and</b> acquaintance-rated <b>humility</b> were not strongly associated. In Study 2, to examine the idea that humility might be associated with increased academic performance, we examined actual course grades of 55 college students who completed <b>Humility</b> <b>and</b> Self-Esteem IATs. Implicit humility correlated positively with higher actual course grades when narcissism, conscientiousness, and implicit self-esteem were simultaneously controlled. Implications and future research directions are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Learning {{cultural}} <b>humility</b> <b>and</b> bias-reducing {{strategies for}} {{those who work with}} diverse populations is critical for students and librarians. Our profession can {{play an important role in}} introducing these concepts and strategies. However, addressing implicit bias <b>and</b> cultural <b>humility</b> in information literacy classes can be difficult. Library staff may be unfamiliar with the concepts or uncertain about how to incorporate them into classes, have little control over class content, or have little time to address these topics. In this session, we describe how we incorporated concepts of cultural <b>humility</b> <b>and</b> implicit bias over five information literacy sessions per course in the three first-year courses for students interested in the medical professions. Attendees will be able to define implicit bias <b>and</b> cultural <b>humility,</b> recognize their own biases, understand why teaching and learning about cultural <b>humility</b> <b>and</b> implicit bias is useful, and incorporate strategies learned in this session into their own classes...|$|R

40|$|Quality social {{relationships}} depend, in part, on deferring self-interest {{to another person}} or group. Being too arrogant or self-focused could negatively affect relationship quality. In two studies we examined possible connections between trait <b>humility</b> <b>and</b> social relationship quality (SRQ). Participants completed survey measures of each construct. Self <b>and</b> peer-reported <b>humility</b> correlated positively with SRQ, even when social desirability (Study 1) and other relevant personality dimensions (e. g., Big Five, agency, communion) were statistically controlled (Study 2). These findings indicate humility could be an important trait with regard to interpersonal relations. Implications are discussed for the cultivation of <b>humility</b> <b>and</b> its potential relevance in other social contexts...|$|R
