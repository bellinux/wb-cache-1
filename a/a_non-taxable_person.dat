40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the various methodologies for estimating marginal effective tax rates applying to investment decisions. The conceptual framework is developed for {{several types of}} investment decisions, including depreciable capital, inventories, and depletable assets. The analysis involves incorporating personal and corporate taxes into the neo-classical theory of the firm. Some of the theoretical issues are discussed including the treatment of adjustment costs, nonprice-taking behaviour, {{and the implications of}} an open economy. The problems involved with implementing effective tax rates empirically are discussed. These include the arbitrage assumption, the treatment of risk, the treatment of firms temporarily in <b>a</b> <b>non-taxable</b> position, and data problems, including problems of aggregation. A number of illustrative calculations are presented using Canadian data. ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{national}} dividend: [...] "The endemic {{gap between}} prices and purchasing power in an advanced economic system in reality is the “leisure dividend” {{that we never}} received from our amazing producing economy. That gap should now be filled by <b>a</b> <b>non-taxable</b> national dividend of two types. One would be a cash stipend paid to all citizens which would also serve the purpose of eliminating poverty by providing everyone with a basic income guarantee. The remainder of the national dividend would consist of an overall pricing subsidy, whereby a designated proportion of all purchases, including home building expenses, would be rebated to consumers. The average national dividend per person would probably exceed $12,000 per year under today’s economic conditions. It would be a calculated value charged against a government ledger but would be off-budget, with no need to finance it with taxation or borrowing ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to groups as value added tax payers. This concept was {{introduced}} into Czech law on 1 st January 2008. A VAT group enables persons that meet the criteria required by the VAT Act {{to be considered a}} single taxable person, i. e. a single tax payer. The Czech VAT group legislation is based on article 11 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 /EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax. The aim of this thesis is to present and thoroughly analyze VAT group legislation in Czech law, and to point out certain pitfalls of this legislation, including its interaction with EU law, and the law of some of the other EU member states. A secondary goal is to assess the rate at which VAT groups are being used in the Czech Republic. The first chapter describes VAT group in EU law, and its introduction into the Czech legal order. The second chapter discusses the requirements that the law puts on members of a VAT group, with extra emphasis on the requirement of close binding of persons, including the membership of physical <b>persons</b> and <b>non-taxable</b> <b>persons</b> in <b>a</b> VAT group. The third chapter deals with VAT group as a subject of legal relations, describing in more detail the concept of a representative member and the responsibilities of a VAT group member. The next chapter takes a more practical [...] ...|$|R
25|$|ETFs are {{structured}} for tax efficiency {{and can be}} more attractive than mutual funds. In the U.S., whenever a mutual fund realizes a capital gain that is not balanced by a realized loss, the mutual fund must distribute the capital gains to its shareholders. This can happen whenever the mutual fund sells portfolio securities, whether to reallocate its investments or to fund shareholder redemptions. These gains are taxable to all shareholders, even those who reinvest the gains distributions in more shares of the fund. In contrast, ETFs are not redeemed by holders (instead, holders simply sell their ETF shares on the stock market, as they would a stock, or effect <b>a</b> <b>non-taxable</b> redemption of <b>a</b> creation unit for portfolio securities), so that investors generally only realize capital gains when they sell their own shares or when the ETF trades to reflect changes in the underlying index.|$|R
5000|$|According to CRA : “Certain {{corporations}} in the mining, oil and gas, {{and renewable energy}} and energy conservation sectors may issue FTSs to help finance their exploration and project development activities. The FTSs must be newly issued shares that have the attributes generally attached to common shares.“Junior resource corporations often have difficulty raising capital to finance their exploration and development activities. Moreover, many are in <b>a</b> <b>non-taxable</b> position and {{do not need to}} deduct their resource expenses. The FTS mechanism allows the issuer corporation to transfer the resource expenses to the investor. A junior resource corporation, in particular, benefits greatly from FTS financing.“The FTS program provides tax incentives to investors who acquire FTSs by allowing:• deductions for resource expenses renounced by eligible corporations; and• investment tax credits for individuals (excluding trusts) on resource expenses in the mining sector that qualify as flow-through mining expenditures.“The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) reviews all FTS arrangements. Audits are carried out to monitor the program.” ...|$|R
30|$|Children {{from the}} Behavior Outlook Norwegian Developmental Study (BONDS) {{were born in}} South East Norway between 2006 and 2008. Parents of newborns were allowed a parental leave of 52  weeks, paid at 80 % of their salary (some {{employers}} would supplement the remaining 20 %), or 42  weeks paid at 100 % of their salary, up to a maximum amount, {{if they had been}} employed for 6 of the past 10  months. Parents could share the leave, except for 3  weeks before the child’s birth and 6  weeks after, which were reserved for the mother, and 4  weeks which were reserved for the father (OECD 2007). Self-employed workers could also benefit from a similar parental leave. Mothers who were not employed or were studying {{at the time of the}} child’s birth received <b>a</b> <b>non-taxable</b> lump sum (NOK 33, 584 in 2006, or approximately USD 4400). In those cases, fathers were allowed 39  weeks of parental leave at 80 % of their salary or 29  weeks at 100 % of their salary.|$|R
30|$|Legislation {{aimed to}} provide all {{children}} in Norway a right to ECEC from age one. The supply of ECEC services has grown in response to both legislation and governmental incentives to providers to increase capacity (Sibley et al. 2015). Almost all services were provided in ECEC centers (fewer than 3 % of children in 2010 – 2011 were receiving services in a family’s home), and all were regulated and heavily subsidized, even though about half were privately owned (Ellingsaeter 2014). Out-of-pocket fees were capped at approximately NOK 2250, or USD 300, per month in 2006, and were tax deductible. They were mostly income-graded, or were reduced or waived for the lowest-income families, depending on the municipality. Fees were reduced by at least 30 % for the second child, and at least 50 % for subsequent children (Ellingsaeter 2014). Parents not opting for subsidized ECEC for a child {{between the ages of}} 1 and 3  years could receive <b>a</b> <b>non-taxable</b> allowance (cash for care), which was reduced as a function of hours used in the subsidized ECEC system (OECD 2007).|$|R
25|$|Although {{the income}} limit for {{allowances}} varied {{according to the}} position of the child in the family and the number of dependent children, these ceilings were made more favourable in cases where both parents were working or where a single parent was in charge and were linked to changes in wage levels. Those taking parental leave to care for three or more children (provided that they fulfilled the rules for eligibility) also received certain benefits in kind, such as <b>a</b> <b>non-taxable,</b> non-means-tested benefit and priority on vocational training courses. A new boost was also given to research into family problems including an interest in the effects of changing family structures, of women’s employment and the impact of local social policies on family life. In addition, while a law on equal opportunities in employment was passed in July 1983 which prohibited all forms of unequal treatment regardless of the circumstances, together with providing for positive action plans to be established in major companies. In January 1984, a decree was made granting state aid to companies which implemented equality plans for staff. That same year, a law was passed that gave the regional Caissess des Allocations Familiales the task of collecting unpaid alimony, initially for lone parents and subsequently for remarried or cohabiting mothers.|$|R

40|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish between types of commercial and residential property for value-added tax (VAT) purposes. The {{reason for this is}} because the supply of residential property may be exempt from VAT in certain cases, whereas the supply of commercial property is a taxable supply. One of the aims of this treatise was to generate some characteristics that can assist vendors to distinguish between types of commercial and residential property for VAT purposes. SARS proposed numerous changes to the VAT Act with regards to fixed property in 2011. This treatise explains the reason for the changes made and also comments on them. Firstly, property developers previously had to account for an output tax adjustment when they changed the use of their property i. e. from a taxable use (selling the completed units) to <b>a</b> <b>non-taxable</b> use (renting the completed units as a residential dwelling). This „output tax adjustment‟ sometimes places developers in a financial dilemma, especially in times of an economic depression. SARS therefore provided „developers‟ as defined with a short term solution. This short term solution provides property developers with a 36 month temporarily relief period, before they have to account for the „output tax adjustment‟. Therefore, the new section 18 B was proposed to assist property developers in times of an economic recession. Secondly, in the past a vendor who acquired a property from a non-vendor to make taxable supplies was allowed a notional input tax deduction, limited to the transfer duty paid. SARS has however "delinked VAT from transfer duty‟, which means that the notional input tax deduction will no longer be limited to the transfer duty paid. This change may benefit vendors as they may now be allowed a bigger input tax deduction. Furthermore, the treatise also compares the VAT treatment of the above issues to that of the goods and services tax treatment in New Zealand. The treatise concludes with a summary of all distinguishing characteristics identified and other findings noted...|$|R
5000|$|Finance Act 1965 also {{introduced}} {{a capital gains}} tax, {{at a rate of}} 30%, charged on the gains arising on the disposal of capital assets by individuals.

The tax applied to company shares as well as other assets. Before 1965, capital gains were not taxed, and it was advantageous for taxpayers to argue that <b>a</b> receipt was <b>non-taxable</b> [...] "capital" [...] rather than taxable [...] "revenue".|$|R
