40|$|Peng Zhang, Chunli Wang, Tao Ma, Shengyi You General Surgery Department, General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, People’s Republic of China Background: The PI 3 K family {{participates in}} {{multiple}} signaling pathways to regulate cellular functions. PI 3 K/Akt signaling pathway {{plays an important}} role in tumorigenesis and development. O-GlcNAcylation, a posttranslational modification, is thought to modulate a wide range of biological processes, such as transcription, cell growth, signal transduction, and cell motility. O-GlcNAcylation is catalyzed by the nucleocytoplasmic enzymes, OGT and OGA, which adds or removes O-GlcNAc moieties, respectively. Abnormal O-GlcNAcylation has been implicated in a variety of human diseases. However, the role of O-GlcNAcylation in tumorigenesis and progression of cancer is still under-investigated. Understanding the O-GlcNAc-associated molecular mechanism might be significant for diagnosis and therapy of cancer. Methods: Human thyroid <b>anaplastic</b> <b>cancer</b> 8305 C cells were used to evaluate the role of O-GlcNAcylation in tumorigenesis and progression of cancer. The global O-GlcNAc level of intracellular proteins was up-regulated by OGA inhibitor Thiamet-G treatment or OGT overexpression. Cell proliferation was assessed by MTT assay. Invasion in vitro was determined by Transwell assay, and phosphorylation of Akt 1 at Ser 473 was assessed by Western blot for activity of Akt 1. PI 3 K-specific inhibitor LY 294002 and RNA interference of Akt 1 were used to investigate the impact of PI 3 K/Akt signaling on the regulation of O-GlcNAcylation during tumor progression. Results: Cell models with remarkably up-regulated O-GlcNAcylation were constructed, and then cell proliferation and invasion were determined. The results indicated that the proliferation was not affected by OGA inhibition or OGT overexpression, while the invasion of 8305 C cells with OGA inhibition or OGT overexpression was obviously increased. Akt 1 activity was stimulated by elevated O-GlcNAcylation by mediating phosphorylation at Ser 473. The enhanced invasion of thyroid cancer cells by Thiamet-G treatment or OGT overexpression was significantly depressed by PI 3 K inhibitor LY 294002. Moreover, silence of Akt 1 remarkably attenuated the increase of cell invasion induced by Thiamet-G treatment, but the invasion was still higher compared to Akt 1 -silenced only cells. In other words, Thiamet-G restored the invasion of Akt 1 -silenced thyroid cancer cells, but it was still lower relative to Thiamet-G-treated only cells. Conclusion: Taken together, our findings suggested that O-GlcNAcylation enhanced the invasion of thyroid <b>anaplastic</b> <b>cancer</b> cells partially by PI 3 K/Akt signaling, which might be a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid <b>anaplastic</b> <b>cancer.</b> Keywords: O-GlcNAcylation, thyroid <b>anaplastic</b> <b>cancer,</b> invasion, PI 3 K/Akt, Akt...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Riedel's thyroiditis, a rare thyroid disease, can be {{difficult}} to diagnose prior to surgical removal and can be confused with malignancy both clinically and cytologically. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 72 -year-old Caucasian woman who presented with a goiter, which showed a rapid increase in size at ultrasound check, suggesting malignancy. Because of inconclusive cytology, a total thyroidectomy was performed. Fine-needle aspiration of the removed thyroid was processed by two-dimensional electrophoresis, and the proteome was compared with both <b>anaplastic</b> <b>cancer</b> and control samples. Significant differentially expressed protein spots were identified by Western blot analysis by using specific antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: The protein pattern of Riedel's fine-needle aspiration revealed a superimposition with that of the control samples. The comparison of the protein pattern of Riedel's thyroiditis fine-needle aspiration with that of <b>anaplastic</b> <b>cancer</b> showed evidence of a different expression of ferritin heavy chains, ferritin light chains, and haptoglobins, as previously reported in thyroid cancers. Therefore, we performed Western blot analysis of these proteins and validated that their expression levels were low or absent in Riedel's thyroiditis and control samples despite the high concentrations present in fine-needle aspiration anaplastic samples. The concurrent absent or low expression levels of haptoglobin, ferritin light chain, and ferritin heavy chain in Riedel's thyroiditis fine-needle aspiration samples strongly indicate the benign nature of the thyroid lesion. These results suggest the potential applicability of fine-needle aspiration proteome analysis for Riedel's thyroiditis diagnosis...|$|E

ObjectiveWe {{describe}} a case of tumor induced osteomalacia (TIO) in a patient with a fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF- 23) secreting anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. The current imaging modalities are reviewed. Design and interventionClinical, biochemical, and radiological assessments were done, including computer tomography (CT) of the neck and skull to thigh positron emission tomography (PET) /CT. The patient underwent surgical tumor debulking three days after presentation due to airway compromise. Molecular studies of the resected tissue were performed using reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and gel electrophoresis for the phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor FGF- 23. ResultsResected tissue demonstrated features of <b>anaplastic</b> thyroid <b>cancer</b> with positive markers for FGF- 23 protein, consistent with a FGF- 23 secreting paraneoplastic tumor. The patient's metastatic burden rapidly progressed as demonstrated by a dramatic rise in serum FGF- 23 levels and worsening hypophosphatemia in concert with progression of the metastatic lesions on PET/CT. ConclusionWe believe that our patient's rapidly progressive <b>anaplastic</b> thyroid <b>cancer</b> was responsible for persistent hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia, substantiated by the finding of FGF- 23 protein within the thyroid tumor cells. Our case indicates that <b>anaplastic</b> thyroid <b>cancer</b> can cause TIO...|$|R

40|$|The role of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) in {{mediating}} {{the action}} of antitumour drug taxol on the cell line of thyroid <b>anaplastic</b> <b>cancer,</b> ARO, is studied.

Taxol did not activate р 38 МАРК but significantly inhibits the activation of ERK 1 / 2, another MAP kinase that participates in survival mechanisms. The possible factor under control of this kinase can be a protein-inhibitor of apoptosis, XIAP. This suggestion is confirmed by experiments with the inhibitor of c-Raf- 1 /MEK 1 /ERK cascade, PD 98059. In {{the presence of the}} inhibitor, the XIAP quantity essentially decreased as well as the cell viability.

Indications for surgery were represented by goiter causing tracheal compression and severe dyspnoea in 6 cases, and by preoperative cytological report of malignancy {{in the other}} 6 cases. The dyspnoea represented an absolute surgical indication. All patients but one were treated by cervicotomy; in one case we performed a median sternotomy. Frozen section was performed in all patients with cytological report of malignancy. Histology detected 3 differentiated cancers, 2 anaplastic cancers, and one follicular adenoma. The patients with benign disease were treated by 4 subtotal thyroidectomies and 3 total lobectomies. Three out of 5 affected by malignant lesions were submitted to a total thyroidectomy (differentiated carcinomas) and 2 to palliative thyroidectomy (anaplastic carcinoma). In this series there were neither intraoperative mortality nor major surgical complications. All the patients with dyspnoea were cured by surgery.

40|$|Anaplastic thyroid {{cancer is}} one of the most {{aggressive}} human malignancies and the outcomes of conventional therapy have been far from satisfactory. Recently, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) -targeted therapy has been introduced as an alternative therapeutic strategy for highly malignant cancers. This study was undertaken to investigate the expression of EGFR in anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines, and to explore the potential of therapies targeting EGFR as a new therapeutic approach. EGFR was universally expressed in <b>anaplastic</b> <b>cancer</b> cell lines at a variety of levels. Specific EGFR stimulation with epidermal growth factor showed significant phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2 and Akt, and resulted in marked growth stimulation in an anaplastic thyroid cancer cell line, which highly expressed EGFR. This EGFR-transmitted proliferation effect of the cancer cell line was completely inhibited by gefitinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Moreover, growth of xenografts inoculated in mice was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner with 25 – 50 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 of gefitinib administrated orally.

The aim {{of this study was to}} identify novel targets for immunotherapy in <b>anaplastic</b> thyroid <b>cancer</b> by analysis of the expression of tumour antigens for which therapeutic agents are available. METHOD AND RESULTS: By immunohistochemistry we observed tumoral expression of CD 70 in 49 % of cases. Expression of its receptor, CD 27, was present mainly in lymphocytes surrounding and infiltrating the tumour and observed only rarely in tumour cells. CD 70 expression was associated with the presence of a precursor papillary thyroid carcinoma and the presence of BRAF V 600 E mutations in the <b>anaplastic</b> thyroid <b>cancer</b> lesion. Furthermore, the expression of CD 70 seems stable during progression of the disease. Tumoral expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L 1) was found in 28. 6 % of the <b>anaplastic</b> thyroid <b>cancer</b> cases. Programmed cell death 1 (PD- 1), the receptor of PD-L 1, was not expressed on the tumour cells. No association between CD 70 expression and PD-L 1 expression could be demonstrated. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that targeted immunotherapy for CD 70 /CD 27 and PD-L 1 /PD- 1 might be promising in <b>anaplastic</b> thyroid <b>cancer.</b> However, as a low amount of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes was observed in most lesions, combined therapy with agents enhancing the invasion of lymphocytes in the tumour region needs to be considered. status: publishe...|$|R
