5|$|B and T {{lymphocytes}} bearing immunoglobulins and T cell receptors, respectively, {{are found}} in all jawed fishes. Indeed, the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> as a whole evolved in an ancestor of all jawed vertebrate.|$|E
5|$|In the {{framework}} of the immune network theory, CDRs are also called idiotypes. According to immune network theory, the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> is regulated by interactions between idiotypes.|$|E
5|$|Evolution of the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> {{occurred}} in an ancestor of the jawed vertebrates. Many {{of the classical}} molecules of the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> (e.g., immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors) exist only in jawed vertebrates. However, a distinct lymphocyte-derived molecule has been discovered in primitive jawless vertebrates, such as the lamprey and hagfish. These animals possess a large array of molecules called Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) that, like the antigen receptors of jawed vertebrates, are produced from {{only a small number}} (one or two) of genes. These molecules are believed to bind pathogenic antigens in a similar way to antibodies, and with the same degree of specificity.|$|E

40|$|Abstractâ€”Alert {{correlation}} is {{the process}} of analyzing, relating and fusing the alerts generated by one or more Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in order to provide a high-level and comprehensive view of the security situation of the system or network. Different approaches, such as rule-based, prerequisites consequences-based, learning-based and similarity-based approach are used in correlation process. In this paper, a new AIS-inspired architecture is presented for alert correlation. Different aspects of human <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> (HIS) are considered to design iCorrelator. Its three-level structure is inspired by three types of responses in human immune system: the innate <b>immune</b> <b>system's</b> response, the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system's</b> primary response, and the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system's</b> secondary response. iCorrelator also uses th...|$|R
5|$|Polyclonal B cell {{response}} {{is a natural}} mode of immune response exhibited by the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> of mammals. It ensures that a single antigen is recognized and attacked through its overlapping parts, called epitopes, by multiple clones of B cell.|$|E
5|$|The {{immune system}} protects organisms from {{infection}} with layered defenses of increasing specificity. In simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses {{from entering the}} organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate immune system provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals. If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> which is activated by the innate response. Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, {{in the form of}} an immunological memory, and allows the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.|$|E
5|$|The body's {{first line}} of defence against viruses is the innate immune system. This {{comprises}} cells and other mechanisms that defend the host from infection in a non-specific manner. This means that {{the cells of the}} innate system recognise, and respond to, pathogens in a generic way, but, unlike the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> it does not confer long-lasting or protective immunity to the host.|$|E
50|$|The {{respiratory}} tract antimicrobial defense {{system is a}} layered defense mechanism which relies on components of both the innate and <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> to protect the lungs {{and the rest of}} the {{respiratory tract}} against inhaled microorganisms.|$|R
50|$|Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells (also {{known as}} {{accessory}} cells) of the mammalian <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b> Their main {{function is to}} process antigen material and present it on the cell surface to the T cells of the <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b> They act as messengers between the innate and the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
40|$|Atherosclerosis is an immune-mediated {{inflammatory}} {{disease of the}} arterial wall, with both the innate and <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> responding to many endogenous and exogenous antigens. Both proatherogenic as well as atheroprotective roles have been identified for the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> in atherosclerosis. Hence, {{it is conceivable that}} an immunomodulatory strategy via active immunization against many of these antigens could potentially alter the natural history of atherosclerosis. This review discusses: 1) the complex role of important components of the innate and <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> in atherogenesis; 2) the nature of many antigens that have been tested successfully in vaccine formulations to reduce atherosclerosis in pre-clinical experimental models; and 3) the potential opportunities and challenges for clinical application of vaccination for atherosclerosis in the future...|$|R
5|$|The {{cells of}} the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> are special types of leukocytes, called {{lymphocytes}}. B cells and T cells are the major types of lymphocytes and are derived from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. B cells {{are involved in the}} humoral immune response, whereas T cells are involved in cell-mediated immune response.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies are protein {{components}} of an <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> whose main {{function is to}} bind antigens, or foreign substances in the body, and target them for destruction. Antibodies can be secreted into the extracellular environment or anchored in the membranes of specialized B cells known as plasma cells. Whereas enzymes are limited in their binding affinity for their substrates by the necessity of conducting their reaction, antibodies have no such constraints. An antibody's binding affinity to its target is extraordinarily high.|$|E
5|$|Leukocytes (white blood cells) {{act like}} independent, {{single-celled}} organisms {{and are the}} second arm of the innate immune system. The innate leukocytes include the phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells), innate lymphoid cells, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and natural killer cells. These cells identify and eliminate pathogens, either by attacking larger pathogens through contact or by engulfing and then killing microorganisms. Innate cells are also important mediators in lymphoid organ development and the activation of the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

40|$|Patients {{with chronic}} {{hepatitis}} C (CHC) virus infection who have persistently normal alanine aminotransferase levels (PNALT) have mild inflammation and fibrosis {{in comparison to}} those with elevated ALT levels. The cellular immune responses to HCV are mainly responsible for viral clearance and the disease pathogenesis during infection. However, since the innate and <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> are suppressed by various kinds of mechanisms in CHC patients, the immunopathogenesis of CHC patients with PNALT is still unclear. In this review, we summarize the representative reports about the immune suppression in CHC {{to better understand the}} immunopathogenesis of PNALT. Then, we summarize and speculate on the immunological aspects of PNALT including innate and <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> and genetic polymorphisms of HLA and cytokines...|$|R
40|$|Lymphoid {{organs are}} {{integral}} parts of all vertebrate <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>systems.</b> Primary lymphoid tissues exhibit a remarkable functional dichotomy: T cells develop in specialized thymopoietic tissues {{located in the}} pharynx, whereas B cells develop in distinct areas of general hematopoietic areas, such as the kidney or bone marrow. Among secondary lymphoid tissues, the spleen is present in all vertebrates, whereas lymph nodes represent an innovation particular to mammals and some birds. A comparative analysis of anatomical, functional and genomic features thus reveals the core components of <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>systems.</b> Such information has guided recent attempts at reconstructing lymphopoietic functions in vivo {{and in the future}} might inspire the development of new strategies for medical interventions restoring and modulating immune functions...|$|R
5|$|Dendritic cells (DC) are phagocytes in tissues {{that are}} {{in contact with the}} {{external}} environment; therefore, they are located mainly in the skin, nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines. They are named for their resemblance to neuronal dendrites, as both have many spine-like projections, but dendritic cells are in no way connected to the nervous system. Dendritic cells serve as a link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems, as they present antigens to T cells, one of the key cell types of the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dendritic cells {{bridge the}} {{innate immune system}} and <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b> They are {{increased}} in psoriatic lesions and induce the proliferation of T cells and type 1 helper T cells (Th1). Targeted immunotherapy as well as psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy can {{reduce the number of}} dendritic cells and favors a Th2 cell cytokine secretion pattern over a Th1/Th17 cell cytokine profile. Psoriatic T cells move from the dermis into the epidermis and secrete interferon-Î³ and interleukin-17. Interleukin-23 is known to induce the production of interleukin-17 and interleukin-22. Interleukin-22 works in combination with interleukin-17 to induce keratinocytes to secrete neutrophil-attracting cytokines.|$|E
5|$|When the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> of a {{vertebrate}} {{encounters a}} virus, it produces specific antibodies that bind {{to the virus}} and often render it non-infectious. This is called humoral immunity. Two types of antibodies are important. The first, called IgM, is highly effective at neutralising viruses but is produced by {{the cells of the}} immune system only for a few weeks. The second, called IgG, is produced indefinitely. The presence of IgM in the blood of the host is used to test for acute infection, whereas IgG indicates an infection sometime in the past. IgG antibody is measured when tests for immunity are carried out.|$|E

40|$|Cancers utilize {{multiple}} {{mechanisms to}} overcome immune responses. Emerging evidence suggest that immunotherapy of cancer {{should focus on}} inducing and re-programming cells of the innate and <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> rather than focusing solely on T cells. Recently, we have shown that such a multifaceted approach can improve immunotherapy of breast cancer...|$|R
5|$|It {{is likely}} that a multicomponent, <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> arose with the first vertebrates, as {{invertebrates}} do not generate lymphocytes or an antibody-based humoral response. Many species, however, utilize mechanisms {{that appear to be}} precursors of these aspects of vertebrate immunity. Immune systems appear even in the structurally most simple forms of life, with bacteria using a unique defense mechanism, called the restriction modification system to protect themselves from viral pathogens, called bacteriophages. Prokaryotes also possess acquired immunity, through a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that they have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block virus replication through a form of RNA interference. Prokaryotes also possess other defense mechanisms. Offensive elements of the immune systems are also present in unicellular eukaryotes, but studies of their roles in defense are few.|$|E
5|$|Neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes {{that travel}} {{throughout}} the body in pursuit of invading pathogens. Neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, normally representing 50% to 60% of the total circulating leukocytes. During the acute phase of inflammation, particularly {{as a result of}} bacterial infection, neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis, and are usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection. Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and: (i) produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes, complement proteins, and cytokines, while they can also (ii) act as scavengers that rid the body of worn-out cells and other debris, and as antigen-presenting cells that activate the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|The initial {{reaction}} of infected cells {{is to produce}} interferon, a cytokine that raises a number of defenses against viral infection through the innate immune system by augmenting {{the production of a}} large group of proteins mediated by the JAK-STAT pathway. Some serotypes of dengue virus appear to have mechanisms to slow down this process. Interferon also activates the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> which leads to the generation of antibodies against the virus as well as T cells that directly attack any cell infected with the virus. Various antibodies are generated; some bind closely to the viral proteins and target them for phagocytosis (ingestion by specialized cells and destruction), but some bind the virus less well and appear instead to deliver the virus into a part of the phagocytes where it is not destroyed but is able to replicate further.|$|E
50|$|In general, vitamin D {{functions}} {{to activate the}} innate and dampen the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>systems.</b> Deficiency {{has been linked to}} increased risk of viral infections, including HIV and influenza.

40|$|The <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> and the {{microbiota}} mutually interact {{to maintain}} homeostasis in the intestine. However, {{components of the}} microbiota can alter this balance and promote chronic inflammation, promoting intestinal tumor development.

25|$|Lampreys provide {{valuable}} insight into <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>systems,</b> as they possess a convergently evolved adaptive immunity with cells that function like the T cells and B cells seen in higher vertebrates. Lamprey leukocytes express surface variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) generated from somatic recombination of leucine-rich repeat gene segments in a recombination activating gene-independent manner.|$|R
5|$|Although {{many more}} {{invertebrates}} than vertebrates {{are used in}} animal testing, these studies are largely unregulated by law. The most frequently used invertebrate species are Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, and Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm. In the case of C. elegans, the worm's body is completely transparent and the precise lineage of all the organism's cells is known, while studies in the fly D. melanogaster can use an amazing array of genetic tools. These invertebrates offer some advantages over vertebrates in animal testing, including their short life cycle and {{the ease with which}} large numbers may be housed and studied. However, the lack of an <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> and their simple organs prevent worms from being used in several aspects of medical research such as vaccine development. Similarly, the fruit fly immune system differs greatly from that of humans, and diseases in insects can be different from diseases in vertebrates; however, fruit flies and waxworms can be useful in studies to identify novel virulence factors or pharmacologically active compounds.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies are {{secreted}} by B {{cells of}} the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> mostly by differentiated B cells called plasma cells. Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell to be free in the blood plasma, and a membrane-bound form that {{is attached to the}} surface of a B cell and {{is referred to as the}} B-cell receptor (BCR). The BCR is found only on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure. In most cases, interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and, therefore, antibody generation following antigen binding. Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids, as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms.|$|E
5|$|The lungs possess several {{characteristics}} which {{protect against}} infection. The lung tract is lined by epithelia with hair-like projections called cilia that beat rhythmically and carry mucus. This mucociliary clearance {{is an important}} defence system against air-borne infection. The dust particles and bacteria in the inhaled air {{are caught in the}} mucosal surface of respiratory passages and are moved up towards the pharynx by the rhythmic upward beating action of the cilia. The lining of the lung also secretes immunoglobulin A which protects against respiratory infections; goblet cells secrete mucus which also contains several antimicrobial compounds such as defensins, antiproteases, and antioxidates. In addition, the lining of the lung also contains macrophages, immune cells which engulf and destroy debris and microbes that enter the lung in a process known as phagocytosis; and dendritic cells which present antigens to activate components of the <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> such as T-cells and B-cells.|$|E
50|$|All {{adenosine}} receptors {{were shown}} to activate at least one subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases. The actions of adenosine are often antagonistic or synergistic to the actions of ATP. In the CNS, adenosine has multiple functions, such as modulation of neural development, neuron and glial signalling and the control of innate and <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lampreys provide {{valuable}} insight into <b>adaptive</b> <b>immune</b> <b>systems,</b> as they possess a convergently evolved adaptive immunity with cells that function like the T cells and B cells seen in higher vertebrates.
