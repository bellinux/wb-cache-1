5000|$|Proteins can {{adopt an}} {{exponential}} {{number of states}} when modeled discretely. Typically, a protein's conformations are represented as sets of dihedral <b>angles,</b> <b>bond</b> lengths, and <b>bond</b> <b>angles</b> between all connected atoms. The most common simplification is to assume ideal bond lengths and <b>bond</b> <b>angles.</b> However, this still leaves the phi-psi angles of the backbone, and up to four dihedral angles for each side chain, leading to a worst case complexity of k6*n possible states of the protein, where n {{is the number of}} residues and k is the number of discrete states modeled for each dihedral angle. In order to reduce the conformational space, one can use protein fragment libraries rather than explicitly model every phi-psi angle.|$|R

Using this general theory above merhoned, we study <b>bond</b> <b>angle</b> for single <b>bond</b> between carbon atoms.

However, the actual C-C-C <b>bond</b> <b>angle</b> is 88° {{because it has a}} slightly folded form to relieve some torsional strain at the expense of slightly more angle strain. The high strain energy of cyclobutane is primarily from angle strain.|$|R
40|$|Analytic {{expressions}} for strains {{in carbon}} nanotubes of all chiralities in lateral and axial directions have been obtained. These expressions have {{been related to}} <b>bond</b> <b>angle</b> and <b>bond</b> length flexibilities. This finally results in obtaining very generalized results for Poisson ratio of all chirality and all diameter carbon nanotubes. It {{turns out that the}} Poisson ratio is always independent of carbon nanotube diameter, but depends on the their chirality. On the assumption of fixed bond lengths, (only flexible <b>bond</b> <b>angle),</b> the Poisson ratio of all chirality tubes is obtained to be 1. When realistic flexibility of bond lengths and <b>bond</b> <b>angles</b> is assumed, the Poisson ratio is between ~ 0 and 0. 3, depending upon chirality. The present calculation of the Poisson ratio does not require any detail of molecular interactions under the assumption of either <b>bond</b> <b>angle</b> or <b>bond</b> length flexibility alone, but does depend on the interaction potential if both are assumed flexible. Further, it has been found that the Poisson ratio is sensitive to applied initial stress, varying significantly when obtained under different initial stress values. It is observed that Poisson ratio can be used to justify the interaction potential by finding out the bond length flexibility in comparison to <b>bond</b> <b>angle</b> flexibility.

In addition to elementary spring energies, we introduce continuous energy terms for <b>bond</b> <b>angles</b> and <b>bond</b> overlap. To find a good graph layout, the energy of a graph is minimized using an optimization technique including the conjugate gradient method. We strive for a simple, flexible, conceptually intuitive and efficient algorithm. Experiments indicate good results from reducing bond overlap, while optimizing <b>bond</b> <b>angles</b> are more difficult without sacrificing other visualization qualities...|$|R
50|$|Molecular {{geometries}} can be {{specified in}} terms of <b>bond</b> lengths, <b>bond</b> <b>angles</b> and torsional <b>angles.</b> The <b>bond</b> length is defined to be the average distance between the nuclei of two atoms bonded together in any given molecule. A <b>bond</b> <b>angle</b> is the angle formed between three atoms across at least two bonds. For four atoms bonded together in a chain, the torsional angle is the angle between the plane formed by the first three atoms and the plane formed by the last three atoms.|$|R
40|$|In many {{computational}} {{studies of}} carbon nanotubes, the minimum energy configuration frequently settles on a structure {{for which the}} bond lengths are distinct. Here, we extend both the rolled-up and the polyhedral models for SWCNTs to produce general models incorporating either distinct bond lengths and the same <b>bond</b> <b>angle,</b> or distinct <b>bond</b> lengths and distinct <b>bond</b> <b>angles.</b> The CNTs considered here {{are assumed to be}} formed by sp 2 hybridization but with different bond lengths so that the nanotube structure is assumed to comprise irregular hexagonal patterns. The polyhedral model with distinct bond lengths and distinct <b>bond</b> <b>angles</b> is based on the two postulates that all bonds lying on the same helix are equal in length and that all atoms are equidistant from a common axis of symmetry. The polyhedral model with distinct bond lengths and the same <b>bond</b> <b>angle</b> has the additional postulate that all the adjacent <b>bond</b> <b>angles</b> are equal. We derive exact formulae for the geometric parameters and we present asymptotic expansions for the polyhedral model with distinct bond lengths and distinct <b>bond</b> <b>angles</b> to the first two orders of magnitude. Good agreement is demonstrated for the predictions of the polyhedral model compared with the results obtained from other computational studies. Richard K. F. Lee, Barry J. Cox and James M. Hil...|$|R

50|$|Molecules with a {{high amount}} of ring strain consist of three, four, and some five-membered rings, including: cyclopropanes, cyclopropenes, cyclobutanes, cyclobutenes, 1,1,1propellanes, 2,2,2propellanes, epoxides, aziridines, cyclopentenes, and norbornenes. These {{molecules}} have <b>bond</b> <b>angles</b> between ring atoms which are more acute than the optimal tetrahedral (109.5°) and trigonal planar (120°) <b>bond</b> <b>angles</b> required by their respective sp3 and sp2 bonds. Because of the smaller <b>bond</b> <b>angles,</b> the <b>bonds</b> have higher energy and adopt more p-character to reduce {{the energy of the}} bonds. In addition, the ring structures of cyclopropanes/enes and cyclclobutanes/enes offer very little conformational flexibility. Thus, the substituents of ring atoms exist in an eclipsed conformation in cyclopropanes and between gauche and eclipsed in cyclobutanes, contributing to higher ring strain energy in the form of Van der Waals repulsion.|$|R

50|$|The bent bond {{theory can}} also explain other {{phenomena}} in organic molecules. In fluoromethane (CH3F), for instance, the experimental F-C-H <b>bond</b> <b>angle</b> is 109°, which {{is greater than}} the calculated value. This is because according to Bent's rule, the C-F bond gains p-orbital character leading to high s-character in the C-H bonds, and H-C-H <b>bond</b> <b>angles</b> approaching those of sp2 orbitals - e.g. 120° - leaving less for the F-C-H <b>bond</b> <b>angle.</b> The difference is again explained in terms of bent bonds.|$|R

When substantial conformational change occurs within the components at the time of complex formation, rigid-body docking is inadequate. However, scoring all possible conformational changes is prohibitively expensive in computer time. Docking procedures which permit conformational change, or flexible docking procedures, must intelligently select small subset of possible conformational changes for consideration.|$|R
