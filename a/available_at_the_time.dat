5|$|Due {{to growing}} {{concerns}} in the public, in 2001 the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health asked the U.S. National Academy of Science's (NAS) Institute of Medicine to establish an independent expert committee to review hypotheses about existing and emerging immunization safety concerns. This initial report found that based on indirect and incomplete evidence <b>available</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> there was inadequate evidence to accept or reject a thiomersal-autism link, though it was biologically plausible.|$|E
5|$|Having {{made only}} 5 and 18 in the {{previous}} Test, Jack Crapp was originally dropped from the team but was reprieved by Washbrook's injury. The England selectors were widely condemned for their decisions, which were seen as an investment in youth rather than necessarily picking the best players <b>available</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> Their frequent changes meant the home team had used a total of 21 players for the five Tests.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} the full Senate {{considered}} Black's nomination. Rumors relating to Black's involvement in the Ku Klux Klan surfaced among the senators, and two Democratic senators tried defeating the nomination. However, no conclusive evidence of Black's involvement was <b>available</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> so after six hours of debate, the Senate voted 63â€“16 to confirm Black. Ten Republicans and six Democrats voted against Black. Alabama Governor Bibb Graves appointed his own wife, Dixie B. Graves, to fill Black's vacated seat.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{idea was to}} film the opening sequence in 1.33:1 aspect ratio in order to simulate the TV screens that were <b>available</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of the assassination, then transition to 1.85:1 when Garrison began his investigation, and finally switch to 2.35:1 for scenes occurring in 1968 and later. However, because of time constraints and logistics, Richardson was forced to abandon this approach.|$|E
5|$|Training started {{immediately}} {{and concentrated on}} physical fitness, weapons training, movement across country including cliff climbing, obstacle crossing and raiding operations. Weapons training was limited {{by the lack of}} anything other than the personal weapons (rifles and pistols) that each man had brought with him. Machine guns or anything heavier were not <b>available</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> In August 1940, some officers and non-commissioned officers (NCO) were sent to Achnacarry in the Scottish Highlands on a commando course. These men were then responsible for teaching the rest of the unit.|$|E
5|$|United States {{officials}} had only estimates of its enemy's capabilities; intelligence collection agencies often conflicted with each other. Thanks to {{improvements to the}} trail system (including opening new routes that would connect to the Sihanouk Trail in Cambodia), the amount of supplies transported during 1965 almost equaled the combined total for the previous five years. During the year interdiction of the system {{had become one of}} the top American priorities, but operations against it were complicated by the limited forces <b>available</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> and Laos's ostensible neutrality.|$|E

5|$|A {{fathometer}} was {{not required}} under USCG regulations, and Fitzgerald lacked one, even though fathometers were <b>available</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of her sinking. Instead, a hand line was the only method Fitzgerald had to take depth soundings. The hand line consisted {{of a piece of}} line knotted at measured intervals with a lead weight on the end. The line was thrown over the bow of the ship and the count of the knots measured the water depth. The NTSB investigation concluded that a fathometer would have provided Fitzgerald additional navigational data and made her less dependent on Anderson for navigational assistance.|$|E
5|$|Canada's Wonderland's first {{interactive}} dark {{ride was}} Scooby-Doo's Haunted Mansion (renamed Boo Blasters on Boo Hill after Cedar Fair's {{purchase of the}} park), which opened in 2000. It was designed by Sally Corporation and relies entirely on physical sets and theming rather than projected animations, and uses basic, moving props. About four years later, park management began discussing {{the addition of a}} new attraction inside Wonder Mountain. The technology <b>available</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> meant the cost of building a more advanced dark ride was too expensive for a regional amusement park. In 2011, as technology improved and the costs decreased, the park started planning a second interactive dark ride. Several companies were contacted to design the audio-visual portion of the future ride; park management chose Triotech to do so.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{disagreements}} {{in management}} and poor communication, construction began on both routes. It was soon {{obvious that the}} southern route was unfeasible given the remote area, technology <b>available</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> and the rough terrain of the San Rafael Swell. The D spent $217,470 (1883, equivalent to $4.6million in 2007) on the project before declaring it a failure. One of the accounts in the book Utah Ghost Rails states the railroad fired the lead surveyor, even though the workers had graded a path past the San Rafael Reef. This route today is a jeep trail. According to a sign placed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), had the southern route succeeded {{it would have been}} the shortest transcontinental railroad in the U.S.|$|E

5|$|Famitsu {{enjoyed the}} higher speed of battle {{compared}} to Episode I. Parkin echoed these sentiments while also noted how mechanics such as Boost {{and the addition}} of side quest content made the game better than its predecessor. GamePro positively noted that the first game's mechanics had been made more approachable for series newcomers, while Massimilla felt that the simplified nature of the character growth system brought down the experience in addition to being shorter than other RPGs <b>available</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> Nutt felt that the alterations made battles far more enjoyable despite the character growth system lacking any meaningful customization options. Dunham echoed other reviewers' opinions on both the upgrades to battle and the reworked character progression system, in addition to the lack of in-game currency to buy items.|$|E
5|$|Fragile Allegiance is {{essentially}} a remake of Gremlin Interactive's 1994 Amiga game K240, with the graphics and user interface revamped for the improved PC hardware <b>available</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> The core gameplay elements of K240 are retained; the game is set in an asteroid belt, the Sci-Tek blueprint system replaces research and the player is tasked with building up a successful mining operation. Many of the buildings, ships and missiles have the same names and functions as those in K240 and in both games there are six alien races competing against the player. The soundtrack for the game was composed by Patrick Phelan who also composed the soundtrack for K240. The game was released in 1996 and competed against other empire building titles such as Ascendancy and Master of Orion 2.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} the GPK was authorised, {{controversy}} raged about the route a railway to England might take. It was plain that Carlisle would be reached from the south; a direct route from Glasgow over the Southern Uplands, the route that {{became known as the}} Annandale line, would involve severe gradients, and pass through almost unpopulated territory. The locomotives <b>available</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> were not thought to be capable of climbing the steep inclines, and rope haulage was put forward by some as the solution. By contrast, a route from Kilmarnock through Cumnock and Dumfriesâ€”the Nithsdale lineâ€”would have much easier gradients and pass through considerable population centres, bringing in additional traffic. Moreover, the Nithsdale route would be much cheaper to build.|$|E

5|$|McCudden's {{long-term}} interest in mechanics {{prompted him to}} modify his own aircraft to increase combat performance. He {{made a series of}} modifications to his aircraft which caused them to excel in performance in comparison to any other S.E.5 at the front and perhaps any other German fighter <b>available</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> Performance, a generic term, required improvements in all-round capability. McCudden's changes were made with one main objective in mind: high-altitude performance. He had achieved some success without these personal experiments. On 23 December 1917, for example, he intercepted an enemy aircraft at 18,000 feet and drove it down to 8,000 feet before shooting it down for his 30th victory. Incidentally, he was nearly killed in action when one of the wings broke away from his victim and nearly struck his own aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Sea Harrier FA2 {{featured}} the Blue Vixen radar, which {{was described as}} one of the most advanced pulse doppler radar systems in the world; the Blue Fox radar was seen by some critics as having comparatively low performance for what was <b>available</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of procurement. The Blue Vixen formed the basis for development of the Eurofighter Typhoon's CAPTOR radar. The Sea Harrier FA2 also carried the AIM-120 AMRAAM missile, the first UK aircraft to be provided with this capability. An upgraded model of the Pegasus engine, the Pegasus Mk 106, was used in the Sea Harrier FA2; in response to the threat of radar-based anti aircraft weapons electronic countermeasures were added. Other improvements included an increase to the air-to-air weapons load, look-down radar, increased range, and improved cockpit displays.|$|E
5|$|Audie Murphy (20 June 1925 â€“ 28 May 1971) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{decorated}} United States Army combat soldiers of World War II, serving from 1942 to 1945. He received every American combat award for valor <b>available</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of his service, including the Medal of Honor. He also received recognitions from France and Belgium. With his 1945 military discharge at the end of the war, Murphy became an advocate of treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder in veterans. The Audie L. Murphy Memorial VA Hospital in San Antonio and the Sergeant Audie Murphy Clubs (SAMC) on military bases honor his contributions. He joined the Texas National Guard in 1950, transferring to reserve status in 1956 and remaining in the Guard until 1969. He also had a civilian career as a film actor and songwriter. Recognitions he received both during his lifetime and posthumously are listed below.|$|E
