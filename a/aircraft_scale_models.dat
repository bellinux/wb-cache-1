5000|$|The {{efforts at}} making an {{authentic}} feature {{led to the}} use of many full size <b>aircraft,</b> <b>scale</b> <b>models</b> and special effects to replicate the scenes at Edwards Air Force Base and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. According to special visual effects supervisor Gary Gutierrez, the first special effects were too clean and they wanted a [...] "dirty, funky, early NASA look." [...] Gutierrez and his team started from scratch, employing unconventional techniques—like going up a hill with model airplanes on wires and fog machines to create clouds, or shooting model F-104s from a crossbow device and capturing their flight with up to four cameras. Avant garde filmmaker Jordan Belson created the background of the Earth as seen from high-flying planes and from orbiting spacecraft.|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{identification}} of large aerospace structures like satellites, launcher components or aircraft prototypes, requires a great experimental effort {{in order to}} assure high quality test results. At the same time, {{because of the high}} development costs, a reduction of the test time is needed. In this paper, a test strategy capable to reduce the overall time required to perform dynamic tests aimed to the estimate of the Frequency Response Functions, FRFs, is introduced. A sine sweep excitation is the key point of the approach because of the good compromise between the excitation level and the testing time. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the dynamic identification strongly depends on the non-parametric estimation method used to compute the FRFs from the sine-sweep input-output data. In this paper, the accuracy of the estimates of both the frequency response functions and the modal parameters due to different sweep rates and different FRF estimation methods will be analyzed. These methods include: harmonic estimator, single-block Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), frequency averaging technique, Welch’s method and Reduced Discrete Fourier Transform (RDFT). The performance of the different estimators is critically assessed by a numerical analysis performed on a lumped parameter system and by experimental investigations carried out on both a GARTEUR <b>aircraft</b> <b>scaled</b> <b>model</b> and the Lambert aircraft M 212. ...|$|R
