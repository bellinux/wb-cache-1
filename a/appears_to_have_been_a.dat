5|$|Abuwtiyuw <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> sighthound, {{a lightly}} built hunting dog {{similar to a}} greyhound, with erect ears and a curly tail. The tomb in which his tablet was {{discovered}} is in Cemetery G 2100 in Giza West Field, close to {{the western side of}} the Great Pyramid of Giza (Pyramid of Khufu/Kheops).|$|E

5|$|Although {{little is}} known about the life and career of Nerva before his {{accession}} as Emperor in 96, he <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> highly adaptable diplomat, surviving multiple regime changes and emerging as one of the Flavians' most trusted advisors. His consulship may therefore have been intended to emphasize the stability and status quo of the regime. The revolt had been suppressed and the Empire returned to order.|$|E
5|$|Anita Morris as Claudette Katzenback: Famous {{singer and}} Herman's wife. Penny catches her with Roger, presumably having sex, but this <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> prank Claudette created. Roger {{originally}} believes she {{was responsible for}} killings. This was Anita Morris' final acting role, as she died seven months before the film's release.|$|E
5|$|Chinese astronomical records {{report that}} in 365 BC, Gan De {{detected}} what <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> moon of Jupiter, probably Ganymede, {{with the naked}} eye. However, Gan De reported {{the color of the}} companion as reddish, which is puzzling since the moons are too faint for their color to be perceived with the naked eye. Shi Shen and Gan De together made fairly accurate observations of the five major planets.|$|E

5|$|The third ealdorman, Æthelweard, today {{best known}} for his Latin history, ruled in the west. Æthelweard was a {{descendant}} of King Æthelred of Wessex and probably the brother of King Eadwig's wife. He <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> supporter of Edward rather than of either faction.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{his service}} as a sheriff, Basset {{also served as a}} royal justice, hearing pleas in Leicestershire in 1129 and 1130. Between 1131 and 1133, Basset <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> {{frequent}} attendee at the royal court, as he witnessed a number of documents. He was present at the councils held at Northampton in 1131 and at Westminster in 1132. Basset witnessed no royal documents after 1133, when King Henry left England for Normandy for the final time.|$|E
5|$|At his trial, Bonnet downplayed his own {{authority}} over his pirate crew. He {{told the court}} that his crew engaged in piracy against his will, {{and said he had}} warned them that he would leave the crew unless they stopped robbing vessels. He further stated that he had been asleep during the capture of the sloop Francis. The court did not accept these protestations. Boatswain Ignatius Pell testified that Bonnet's quartermaster, Robert Tucker, had more power than Bonnet. A powerful quartermaster <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> common feature of pirate crews in the early modern era.|$|E

5|$|If the Annals of Inisfallen {{is to be}} believed, Toirdelbach {{acquired}} {{possession of}} Dublin when the Dubliners themselves offered him its kingship. Although this record may be mere Uí Briain propaganda, it could instead reveal that the Dubliners preferred a distant overlord from Munster rather than one from neighbouring Leinster. Within the year, the kingship was held by Gofraid mac Amlaíb meic Ragnaill (died 1075). The latter <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> kinsman of Echmarcach, and {{may well have been}} handed the kinship by Toirdelbach, perhaps on account of the considerable distance between the kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|Only {{weeks after}} gaining the kingship, Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson was slain by a knight named Ívarr and his accomplices. The kingship was then seized by Haraldr Guðrøðarson, Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's first cousin once removed, {{suggesting}} that the killers and the new king had colluded together. The assassination, therefore, <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> continuation of the vicious family feud that had engulfed the Crovan dynasty since the late twelfth century, when Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's father and Haraldr Guðrøðarson's grandfather first contested the kingship of the Isles.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{dating from}} St-Calais' {{time is the}} confraternity {{relationship}} between the monks of Durham and the monks of the monastery of Saint Calais in Maine. The cult of Saint Calais {{appears to have been}} confined to the region around the monastery which the saint had founded. St-Calais <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> devotee of the cult, and the most likely date for the creation of the confraternity link between the two houses is during St-Calais' time as bishop.|$|E

50|$|Compared {{to other}} presbyornithids, Willaru <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{specialised}} <b>to</b> a more terrestrial lifestyle, {{based on its}} tarsometatarsal morphology. In particular, the latter W. prideauxi <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> more specialised towards terrestriality than the earlier W. elfordi, being larger and more robust, indicating a clear speciation towards this lifestyle and therefore a direct species sequence.|$|R

5|$|Sources {{conflict}} {{as to the}} identity of Buffalo's father, who {{may also have been}} named Andaigweos. He <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> descendant or relative of the famous war chief Waubojeeg. When he was about 10, Buffalo and his parents moved from La Pointe to the vicinity of what now is Buffalo, New York, and lived there until about he was about 12. The family relocated to the Mackinac Island area for a while before returning to La Pointe. In his youth, Kechewaishke was admired as a skilled hunter and athlete.|$|E
5|$|The {{most famous}} {{project of the}} Mycenaean era was the network of roads in the Peloponnese. This appears to have {{facilitated}} the speedy deployment of troops—for example, {{the remnants of a}} Mycenaean road, along with what <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> Mycenaean defensive wall on the Isthmus of Corinth. The Mycenaean era saw the zenith of infrastructure engineering in Greece, and this appears not to have been limited to the Argive plain.|$|E
5|$|The nondenominational St Tugual's Chapel {{dates to}} the 11th century, but it is {{believed}} that there was a place of worship on Herm {{as far back as the}} 6th century, although it hasn't been confirmed whether the chapel was founded by St Tugual himself or his followers at a later date. The current building is Norman and <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> monastery during medieval times. Of particular note is its stained glass windows featuring Noah's Ark and Guernsey cows and Jesus talking to the fisherman at Herm harbour. In 2010 and 2011, the chapel was closed for restoration work.|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In the episode Mulder and Scully are called in to investigate a claim of rape made by a nurse at a nursing home; the case falls into {{the purview of the}} X-Files because the assailant <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> disembodied spirit.|$|E
5|$|Ímar mac Arailt (died 1054) was an eleventh-century {{ruler of}} the Kingdom of Dublin and perhaps the Kingdom of the Isles. He {{was the son of}} a man named Aralt, and <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> {{grandson}} of Amlaíb Cuarán, King of Northumbria and Dublin. Such a relationship would have meant that Ímar was a member of the Uí Ímair, and that he was a nephew of Amlaíb Cuarán's son, Sitriuc mac Amlaíb, King of Dublin, a man driven from Dublin by Echmarcach mac Ragnaill in 1036.|$|E
5|$|After this {{defeat and}} the {{defection}} {{of one of}} his sub-units to Drljević, Đurišić was forced to negotiate directly with the leaders of the NDH forces about the further movement of his Chetniks towards Slovenia. This <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> trap; he was attacked and captured by the NDH {{on his way to the}} meeting. Events after his capture are unclear, but Đurišić, Vasić, Ostojić, and Baćović were subsequently killed along with othersincluding some Serbian Orthodox priests. According to Pajović, the Ustaše executed Đurišić in late April 1945 at the Jasenovac concentration camp. The website of the Jasenovac Memorial Site says Đurišić was killed at the camp by the Ustaše in 1945. The location of Đurišić's grave, if any, is unknown.|$|E
