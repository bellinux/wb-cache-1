50|$|The {{application}} of braces moves the teeth {{as a result}} of force and pressure on the teeth. There are traditionally four basic elements that are used: brackets, bonding material, <b>arch</b> <b>wire,</b> and ligature elastic (also called an “O-ring”). The teeth move when the <b>arch</b> <b>wire</b> puts pressure on the brackets and teeth. Sometimes springs or rubber bands are used to put more force in a specific direction.|$|E

There is a push rod that is attached to the lower <b>arch</b> <b>wire</b> and then placed inside the spring modules.|$|E
50|$|When teeth move, {{the end of}} the <b>arch</b> <b>wire</b> {{may become}} displaced, causing it to poke the back of the patient's cheek. Dental wax can be applied to cushion the {{protruding}} wire. The orthodontist must be called immediately to have it clipped, or a painful mouth ulcer may form. If the wire is causing severe pain, {{it may be necessary to}} carefully bend the edge of the wire in with a spoon or other piece of equipment (e.g. tweezers, clean eraser side of a pencil) until the wire can be clipped by an orthodontist.|$|E
40|$|Background:The color {{stability}} of aesthetic <b>arch</b> <b>wires</b> {{is an important}} factor in the success of an aesthetic orthodontic treatment, but the color of these <b>arch</b> <b>wires</b> tends to change with time. This study was performed to assess the effect of two types of mouth washes on the color  stability of different types of aesthetic <b>arch</b> <b>wires</b> at different time intervals. Materials and methods:Four brands of nickel titanium coated aesthetic <b>arch</b> <b>wires</b> were used: epoxy coated (Orthotechnology and G&H) and Teflon coated (Dany and Hubit). Thirty six samples were prepared, each sample contains ten halves of the aesthetic <b>arch</b> <b>wires.</b> They were divided into three groups according to the immersion media (distilled water as a control media, Listerine with fluoride and Listerine without fluoride) and immersed for 30 seconds twice daily according to manufacturer's instructions to measure color change after 1 week, 3 weeks and 6 weeks by using spectrophotometer VITA Easyshade Compact according to Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage L*a*b* color space system. Results:It was found that there were highly significant differences in color change values of aesthetic <b>arch</b> <b>wires</b> among all immersion media at different time intervals and color change value increases as the time of immersion increases. Additionally, Listerine with fluoride mouth wash caused higher color change values of aesthetic <b>arch</b> <b>wires</b> than Listerine without fluoride and Hubit aesthetic <b>arch</b> <b>wires</b> were the least color stable while Orthotechnology aesthetic <b>arch</b> <b>wires</b> were the most color stable. Conclusions: We can conclude that the daily use of Listerine mouth washes could affect on the {{color stability}} of aesthetic <b>arch</b> <b>wires.</b> Although all tested aesthetic <b>arch</b> <b>wires</b> revealed color changes at variable degrees but some of these changes were not  visible and the others were clinically acceptable while the remaining were clinically unacceptable...|$|R
40|$|Aims of study: The {{present study}} was carried out to assess whether as {{received}} <b>arch</b> <b>wires</b> from manufactures are free of microbial contamination {{as well as to}} identify the bacterial count and types attached to <b>arch</b> <b>wires.</b> Materials and Methods: Eighty samples were included in this study consisting of two types of <b>arch</b> <b>wires</b> (nitinol and stainlesssteel); they were from four companies (3 M, Ortho-Technology, Jiscop and G&H). The wires were inserted into plane tubes that contain 10 ml of BHI broth and tris-EDTA. Further 0. 1 ml was withdrawn from plane tube and spread on agar plates. Moreover 16 plane tubes (8 tubes with brain heart infusion broth and 8 with tris-EDTA) without <b>arch</b> <b>wires</b> were considered as controls group. Results: Microbial sampling yielded growth from 7 of the 80 <b>arch</b> <b>wires</b> studied, the predominant bacteria isolated were staphylococci spp. No growth was recovered from 73 of the samples and from controls. The total viable count of bacteria in BHI reagent is more than that in Tris-EDTA reagent with statistically significant difference (P 0. 05). In regard to the presence and distribution of bacteria according to types of wires, the stainless-steel wires have more viable count (49. 58) than that in nitinol (47. 42) but statistically not significant (P 0. 05). Conclusion: The <b>arch</b> <b>wires</b> received from manufacturer are often contaminated and therefore {{there is a need for}} routine disinfection of such items. This study found that the BHI more is effective in dislodging the bacteria from orthodontic <b>arch</b> <b>wires</b> than tris- EDTA.

50|$|According to {{scholars}} and historians, braces {{date back to}} ancient times. Around 400-300 BCE, Hippocrates and Aristotle contemplated ways to straighten teeth and fix various dental conditions. Archaeologists have discovered numerous mummified ancient individuals with {{what appear to be}} metal bands wrapped around their teeth. Catgut, a type of cord made from the natural fibers of an animal's intestines, performed a similar role to today’s orthodontic wire in closing gaps in the teeth and mouth.The Etruscans buried their dead with dental appliances in place to maintain space and prevent collapse of the teeth during the afterlife. A Roman tomb was found with a number of teeth bound with gold wire documented as a ligature wire, a small elastic wire that is used to affix the <b>arch</b> <b>wire</b> to the bracket. Even Cleopatra wore a pair. Roman philosopher and physician Aulus Cornelius Celsus first recorded the treatment of teeth by finger pressure. Unfortunately, due to lack of evidence, poor preservation of bodies, and primitive technology, little research was carried out on dental braces until around the 17th century, although dentistry was making great advancements as a profession by then.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} study was to compare root resorption after the leveling phase of treatment, performed by either super-elastic or conventional multi-stranded stainless steel <b>arch</b> <b>wires.</b> Methods: From a total of 156 future orthodontic patients in a private clinic, 82 {{were included in the}} study after excluding those who earlier had orthodontic or endodontic treatment or signs of resorption. Patients were equally arbitrary allocated into two groups, where leveling was performed either with super-elastic heat-activated or conventional multi-stranded stainless steel <b>arch</b> <b>wires.</b> Root length loss was calculated using pre-treatment and post-leveling periapical radiographs. Results: The use of super-elastic <b>arch</b> <b>wires</b> did not significantly increase the severity of root resorption, except for tooth 31, while it reduced leveling time compared to conventional stainless steel wires.

40|$|Introduction: The {{maintenance}} of oral hygiene {{is an integral}} part of orthodontic treatment. Hence, the orthodontist may prescribe mouthwashes which have positive effects on periodontal health, but to our knowledge little attention is being paid on the negative effects of these mouthwashes on the properties of <b>arch</b> <b>wires.</b> The objective of this study was to evaluate the reliability of organic mouthwashes over inorganic mouthwashes in assessment of corrosion resistance of different <b>arch</b> <b>wires.</b> Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on two different commercially available NiTi <b>arch</b> <b>wires</b> (0. 016 ") in diameter which were divided into different groups according to the mouthwash used and the manufacturer companies. The linear polarization test performed by potentiostat was used to evaluate the corrosion resistance of commercial NiTi wires in acidic artificial saliva at 37 °C. One-way analysis of variance was used to analyze polarization resistance with the wire manufacturer as the variable factor. Results: Organic mouthwashes (showed significantly decreased corrosion rate than the inorganic mouthwashes (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: (1) Listerine mouthwash showed the highest corrosion rate; organic mouthwash showed the least corrosion rate whereas chlorhexidine mouthwash showed the intermediate corrosion rate.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{introduce}} antimicrobial activity to stainless steel orthodontic <b>arch</b> <b>wires</b> by coating them with TiO 2 in anatase form. Stainless steel (0. 016 × 0. 022 inch), D-rect (0. 016 × 0. 022 inch), and multistranded hammered retainer wires (0. 014 × 0. 018 inch) were coated with TiO 2 anatase by the sol-gel dip coating method. The wires were assessed for their photocatalytic antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, and Enterococcus faecalis. After illumination under UVA (315 – 400 nm) at 1. 0 mW/cm 2 for 1 h, the reduction efficiencies of the anatase-coated <b>arch</b> <b>wires</b> were calculated by using colony-forming unit counts. All anatase-coated <b>arch</b> <b>wires</b> showed remarkable inhibitor effects against the test microorganisms under UVA. The most efficient wire on S. mutans was the stainless steel wire, with a 99. 99 % reduction in growth, but multistranded hammered retainer wire was the most active against both C. albicans and E. faecalis, with 98. 0 % and 91. 68 % reduction rates, respectively.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} and compare the load-deflection rate of optiflex <b>arch</b> <b>wire</b> with that of coaxial <b>arch</b> <b>wire</b> and to determine and compare the decrowding efficiency of optiflex <b>arch</b> <b>wire</b> with coaxial <b>arch</b> <b>wire</b> within a period of 45 days. Materials and Methods: Load-deflection rates of optiflex and coaxial wires were found using the INSTRON (4300) machine. A steady load was given to the wire to make it deflect, and the load required to deflect the wire for every 1 mm up to 5 mm, were noted and tabulated. A total of 10 patients, 10 - 25 years of age (seven males and three females) were selected. All patients had angles Class I malocclusion with a crowding discrepancy of 3 - 9 mm (according to little′s index). All patients required first premolar extraction. Pre (0 day) and post (45 th day) treatment study models and lateral cephalograms were taken for all patients and evaluated. Results: Optiflex had a low load-deflection when compared to coaxial wire. Clinically, optiflex and coaxial wire had similar decrowding efficiency. In both, study model and cephalometric analysis, there was no statistically significant value when comparing their mean variables.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the in vitro {{coefficient of friction}} of stainless steel arch wire-bracket combinations under fretting contact test conditions performed in air and in different aqueous solutions, like Ringer solution, Ringer with addition of a buffer, Ringer with addition of glucose, and Coca Cola. METHODS: The fretting test set-up used allowed to control on-line the contact configuration and the positioning of the contacting parts. A specific positioning method was used to achieve a parallel alignment of <b>arch</b> <b>wire</b> and bracket slot. The effect of <b>arch</b> <b>wire</b> size, roughness, and test environment were investigated. RESULTS: It {{was found that the}} aqueous solutions act as a lubricant compared to air. Friction was affected by the <b>arch</b> <b>wire</b> width while the roughness was found to have a limited effect. Stainless steel 0. 018 '' x 0. 025 '' arch wires exhibited higher frictional forces than stainless steel 0. 017 '' x 0. 025 '' arch wires on sliding against stainless steel 0. 018 '' x 0. 025 '' brackets in the selected test environments when tested under identical fretting test conditions. The wear damage on the <b>arch</b> <b>wire</b> after these in-vitro fretting tests was investigated.

40|$|The Twin – Arch Technique {{is based}} on the concept of {{orthodontic}} treatments with two <b>arch</b> <b>wires</b> simultaneously, even with relatively low dimensions. This method allows you to achieve a good three dimensional control of tooth movements. The use of the Twin – Arch Technique requires a bracket apt to accept two <b>arch</b> <b>wires</b> simultaneously. The new SNB – Bracket (- Swiss Non – Ligating Bracket) offers these features. It consists of PolyEetherEetherKetone (Known as PEEK) and has two slots arrayed vertically in a distance of 2 mm from each other. Two metal gliders hold the wires in place. The low dimensions of the slots (0. 0016 x 0, 0022 inch) offer a "Light – <b>wire</b> technique". Two <b>arch</b> <b>wires</b> inserted in the appropriate slots, one in a distance of 2 mm vertically from the other, can be compared to an equal broad metal band. This treatment technique can be used either lingual or labial. The PolyEetherEetherKetone from which the SNB – bracket is fabricated has a Teflon – like surface which assists in reducing treatment time due to its low friction coefficient. This becomes evident especially in relapse cases, with crowding in the anterior region. If torque is to be generated for a single tooth or a group of teeth, various solutions are at hand. The Twin – Arch Technique controls efficiently, "the dreaded bowing effect" in extraction cases. The SNB – Bracket brings a new dimension into the orthodontic world which is most apparent in extraction cases. Its Teflon – like material has a very low friction coefficient thus, reducing the treatment time considerably.

30|$|At {{the same}} Cohrane review, {{the lack of}} RCTs {{on the effect of}} {{different}} types of aligning <b>arch</b> <b>wires</b> on the severity of the induced root resorption was emphasized. At the experimental premolar buccal tipping by Weiland [15], root resorptive activity was found lower for the teeth moved by steel than super-elastic wires. The present study evaluated root resorption during the first phase of orthodontic treatment. Any type of tooth movement necessary for alignment was performed. No statistically significant difference was found between super-elastic and multi-stranded steel <b>arch</b> <b>wires,</b> except for the lower left central incisor which seemed to be significantly more affected by root resorption in the group treated with super-elastic <b>arch</b> <b>wires.</b> A general tendency for more severe apical root resorption in the super-elastic group was noticed, but that was only significant for tooth 31. Treatment duration that has been considered a risk factor for orthodontically induced root resorption [17 – 19] was longer for the stainless steel group. It could be hypothesized that the inactive intervals at force application, which may prolong treatment time, allow for repair of resorption lacunae. When orthodontic force is discontinued or falls under a certain level, lacunae are repaired by a process that is similar to the early cementogenesis occurring during tooth development [20, 21]. In other experimental animal studies, allowing for inactive periods of force application was beneficial against root resorption [22 – 24].|$|R
