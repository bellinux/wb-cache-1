5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> is printed, the {{neighborhood}} learns of Mac's past, {{and members of}} a local country–western band visit him to show their respect. Although he greets them politely, Mac remains reluctant to open up about his past. Later, he secretly attends Dixie's concert. She passionately sings several songs that Mac wrote years earlier, and he leaves {{in the middle of}} the performance. Backstage, he talks to Dixie's manager, his old friend Harry (Wilford Brimley). Mac gives him a copy of a new song he has written and asks him to show it to Dixie. Mac tries to talk to Dixie, but she becomes angry upon seeing him and warns him to stay away from their 18-year-old daughter, Sue Anne (Ellen Barkin).|$|E
5|$|Ikumi's initial {{vision for}} Tokyo Mew Mew {{was a story}} called Tokyo Black Cat Girl that {{featured}} a cat-girl battling alien invaders. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> was transitioned to a more upbeat story of five female superhumans, the character designs were redone to have a lighter, more colorful feel. The main series characters were praised for being a perfect fit for the overall story, {{as well as for}} their cute appearances. The characters introduced in a la Mode were also praised for their visual appearances, but criticized as being repeats of the original series.|$|E

Also {{during the reign of}} Yahdun-Lim, the kingdom of Yamhad in Aleppo and its king Sumu-Epuh enter the historical record through the texts of Mari.|$|E

5|$|Casino Royale {{takes place}} at the {{beginning}} of Bond's career as Agent 007, just as he is earning his licence to kill. The film's plot sees Bond becoming involved in an assignment to bankrupt terrorist financier Le Chiffre in a high-stakes poker game, after foiling an attack he arranged on a new aircraft being demonstrated at Miami International Airport; during the course of his assignment, Bond falls in love with Vesper Lynd, a treasury employee assigned to provide the money he needs for the game. The film is part of a story arc that continues in Quantum of Solace (2008), with explicit references to the characters and events being made in films set <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> within Skyfall (2012) and Spectre (2015). Casting the film involved a widespread search for a new actor to portray James Bond, and significant controversy surrounded Craig when he was selected to succeed Pierce Brosnan in October 2005. Location filming took place in the Czech Republic, the Bahamas, Italy and the United Kingdom with interior sets built at Barrandov Studios and Pinewood Studios; although part of the storyline is set in Montenegro, no filming took place there.|$|E

25|$|ESPN's Outside the Lines aired a {{story on}} the legal {{troubles}} of the Penn State football team on July 27, 2008. The story detailed the increased number of PSU football players that have been arrested during the past few years. Among the statistics presented in the story was that 46 different players since 2002 have been charged with a combined 163 counts that have resulted in 27 players pleading guilty to 45 crimes. Three days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> aired, Paterno dismissed Baker and Taylor, apparently after another off-campus incident.|$|E
25|$|Two days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> was published, detectives arrested Brooklyn Eagle {{reporter}} Francis A.

Having an intimate knowledge of the newspaper industry, he knew that the price of gold would skyrocket if word got out of a delay in the war effort. He invested heavily in gold and, when he and Mallison used various couriers to plant the false information in the press the following morning, it was a simple matter for him to sell his shares once the price had risen enough for him to make a huge profit.|$|E

25|$|In 1997, {{prior to}} Fiorina's joining the company, HP's Dutch {{subsidiary}} formed {{a partnership with}} a company in Dubai, Redington Gulf, which sold HP's products in Iran. Under Fiorina's leadership at HP, the company sold {{millions of dollars worth}} of printers and computer products to Iran through the foreign subsidiary, while U.S. export sanctions were in effect. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> was initially reported by The Boston Globe in 2008, the SEC sent a letter of inquiry to HP, who responded that products worth 120 million were sold in fiscal 2008 arguing that the sales did not violate export sanctions because they were made through a foreign subsidiary. According to former officials who worked on sanctions, HP was using a loophole by routing their sales through a foreign subsidiary. HP ended its relationship with Redington Gulf after the SEC inquiry.|$|E
25|$|At the Auto Club Speedway in California, Harvick {{blew his}} engine and it {{forced him to}} not finish the race, which {{resulted}} in his first DNF in 82 starts. Harvick won the first 2009 Nationwide Series race at Bristol, his 1st win in his own car. In addition, he won the Camping World Truck Series race at Martinsville Speedway. During the season, Gil Martin became the new crew chief for Harvick as Childress decided to switch all team members of the No. 07 and No. 29 except the drivers and spotters, thus giving Casey Mears Harvick's crew chief Todd Berrier. In the first five races following the switch, Harvick finished {{with an average of}} 25.4, finishing 34th, 11th, 41st, 17th, and 24th respectively. A short time later, reports surfaced stating that Harvick had asked a release of his contract {{at the end of the}} 2009 season to secure a ride at Stewart Haas Racing for the 2010 season. Harvick did not comment publicly on the subject of where he would be driving in 2010. The first race <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> broke, Kevin finished 6th at the Allstate 400 at the Brickyard at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. His best race came at the Pep Boys Auto 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, where Harvick had the best car in a long run and led for most of the race, but was denied victory after a late race caution from which later eventual race winner Kasey Kahne took advantage of when he went past Harvick on the restart; he finished 2nd.|$|E
25|$|In Boston, the LRV {{situation}} {{was becoming a}} major political and public relations nightmare {{and led to the}} LRV fleet availability typically being less than 50% {{of the total number of}} cars on the property for the first few years of service. The MBTA was still accepting new cars from Boeing-Vertol, but the cars were falling out of service faster than the MBTA's maintenance staff could repair them. Additionally, the MBTA could not acquire replacement parts fast enough to repair the disabled LRVs. In a desperate effort to keep as many LRVs operating as possible, MBTA maintenance crews began cannibalizing some of the disabled cars for replacement parts. To help prevent the riding public from seeing the sheer number of brand-new, but heavily cannibalized LRVs, several of the cars were hidden around the system where the public was not likely to find them. A major newspaper story emerged when a reporter and a photographer managed to get into a section of the Green Line's subway which was not in use at the time and found it was full of cannibalized cars which had been abandoned in the tunnel. The MBTA had been towing the cars into the subway during the middle of the night when the subway was closed to the public. The story and photographs brought the problems with the LRV into the public eye for the first time. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> broke, out-of-service LRVs began to appear in several storage yards which were easily viewed by the public, though this may have simply been due to the ever-increasing number of disabled cars.|$|E

25|$|May 2002 {{also saw}} the revelation that the new public works minister, Don Boudria, had spent the weekend of March 16–17, 2002 at an estate owned by Claude Boulay, the {{president}} of Groupe Everest advertising firm that head received $55million in contracts from the public works ministry, apparently for free. Only <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of Boudria's stay at the Boulay estate broke in May did Boulay cash an $800 cheque from Boudria that was dated March 16, 2002; many found this to be too convenient, and opposition critics suggested that the cheque had been post-dated to explain away what {{would otherwise have been}} a major ethical violation on the part of Boudria. Boudria was forced to resign on 26 May, to be replaced with Ralph Goodale. An additional scandal broke later in May 2002 when it was revealed that the Defence Minister Art Eggleton had rewarded a contract worth $36, 500 to research mental illness amongst former soldiers to his former lover Maggie Maier without tender {{while at the same time}} the Defence Ministry had already hired a team of experts to research the same subject. As Eggleton was a Paul Martin supporter, Chrétien promptly fired him on May 27, 2002, following a ruling from Howard Wilson that Eggleton had broken conflict-of-interest rules. Some such as the columnist Don Martin believed that Wilson's swift running against the Martinista Eggleton was suspicious with Martin writing Wilson had within a day ruled that Eggleton had broken conflict-of-interest rules while Martin wrote: “But what would you call the prime minister’s chat with a Crown corporation banker to bail out a hotel linked to a golf course he may still have an interest in? Funny, ethics counsellor Howard Wilson was in a “see no evil” monkey mode on that score”.|$|E
