25|$|The {{measurement}} of critical application characteristics involves measuring structural {{attributes of the}} application's architecture, coding, and in-line documentation, <b>as</b> <b>displayed</b> <b>in</b> the picture above. Thus, each characteristic is affected by attributes at numerous levels of abstraction in the application and all of which must be included calculating the characteristic's measure {{if it is to}} be a valuable predictor of quality outcomes that affect the business. The layered approach to calculating characteristic measures displayed in the figure above was first proposed by Boehm and his colleagues at TRW (Boehm, 1978) and is the approach taken in the ISO 9126 and 25000 series standards. These attributes can be measured from the parsed results of a static analysis of the application source code. Even dynamic characteristics of applications such as reliability and performance efficiency have their causal roots in the static structure of the application.|$|E

Idol explained {{that he was trying to}} capture the political and economic conflict that had created the LA Riots. Idol further felt that the camcorder – <b>as</b> <b>displayed</b> <b>in</b> the witnessing of the Rodney King beating – was a [...] "potent way of conveying ideas" [...] and an important metaphor for technology used in rebellion.|$|E
500|$|There is no {{independent}} confirmation of Hubbard's claims, though Thompson's existence has been proven. This encounter {{is used in}} Scientology's biographies as evidence that Hubbard was trained in a scientific approach to the mind, but found it unsatisfying. Christiansen notes that Dianetics was [...] "very much inspired by Freudian theory". Hubbard's invocation of Thompson therefore serves to highlight his claimed knowledge of Freud's ideas, but also his exceptional maturity; as the official account has it, [...] "Ron was also left with many unanswered questions" [...] which prompted him to undertake further enquiries. This, in Christiansen's view, has strong parallels {{with the story of}} the child Jesus: [...] "in particular, the emphasis on the clever child having different skills and qualities from those of boys of the same age", <b>as</b> <b>displayed</b> <b>in</b> incidents such as the twelve-year-old Jesus lecturing the scribes in the Temple of Jerusalem.|$|E

60|$|Profligate necessities, however, had obliged {{the owner}} {{to part with}} this portion of his possessions, which was {{purchased}} by a merchant well known to Numerian, who received it as a legacy at his friend's death. Disgusted, {{as soon as his}} reforming projects took possession of his mind, at the bare idea of propinquity to the ennobled libertines of Rome, the austere Christian determined to abandon his inheritance, and to sell it to another; but, at the repeated entreaties of his daughter, he at length consented to change his purpose, and sacrifice his antipathy to his luxurious neighbours to his child's youthful attachment to the beauties of Nature <b>as</b> <b>displayed</b> <b>in</b> his legacy on the Pincian Mount. In this instance only did the natural affection of the father prevail over the acquired severity of the reformer. Here he condescended, for the first and the last time, to the sweet trivialities of youth. Here, indulgent in spite of himself, he fixed his little household, and permitted to his daughter her sole recreations of tending the flowers in the garden and luxuriating in the loveliness of the distant view.|$|E

60|$|Of {{the merits}} of the Lowell Offering as a {{literary}} production, I will only observe, putting entirely out of sight the fact of the articles having been written by these girls after the arduous labours of the day, that it will compare advantageously with a great many English Annuals. It is pleasant to find that many of its Tales are of the Mills and of those who work in them; that they inculcate habits of self-denial and contentment, and teach good doctrines of enlarged benevolence. A strong feeling for the beauties of nature, <b>as</b> <b>displayed</b> <b>in</b> the solitudes the writers have left at home, breathes through its pages like wholesome village air; and though a circulating library is a favourable school for the study of such topics, it has very scant allusion to fine clothes, fine marriages, fine houses, or fine life. Some persons might object to the papers being signed occasionally with rather fine names, but this is an American fashion. One of the provinces of the state legislature of Massachusetts is to alter ugly names into pretty ones, as the children improve upon the tastes of their parents. These changes costing little or nothing, scores of Mary Annes are solemnly converted into Bevelinas every session.|$|E
60|$|In truth, Dermot did {{not keep}} that {{reputation}} much longer than his petticoats. Ere long he was a pickle of the first order, equalling the sublime naughtiness of Holiday House, and was continually being sent home by private tutors, who could not manage him. All the time I had a secret conviction that, {{if he had been}} my own mother's son, she could have managed him, and he would never have even wished to do what she disapproved; but Lady Diana had no sympathy or warmth in her, and while she loved her children she fretted them, and never thawed nor unbent; and when she called in her brother's support, Dermot's nerves were driven frantic by the long harangues, and his relief was in antics which of course redoubled his offence. After he had put crackers into his uncle's boots, peppered the coachman's wig, inserted a live toad in the centre of a fortification of clear jelly at a great luncheon, and had one Christmas painted the two stone wild boars that guard the iron gates of Erymanth Castle into startling resemblance of the porkers <b>as</b> <b>displayed</b> <b>in</b> butchers' shops, with a little tin pail at the snout of each, labelling each sevenpence-ha'penny per pound, his uncle had little more hope of him.|$|E
60|$|In {{discussing}} the savage myths {{of the origin}} of the world and of man, we observed that they were as inconsistent as they were fanciful. Among the fancies embodied in the myths was noted the theory that the world, or various parts of it, had been formed out of the body of some huge non-natural being, a god, or giant, or a member of some ancient mysterious race. We also noted the myths of the original union of heaven and earth, and their violent separation <b>as</b> <b>displayed</b> <b>in</b> the tales of Greeks and Maoris, to which may be added the Acagchemem nation in California.(1) Another feature of savage cosmogonies, illustrated especially in some early Slavonic myths, in Australian legends, and in the faith of the American races, was the creation of the world, or the recovery of a drowned world by animals, as the raven, the dove and the coyote. The hatching of all things out of an egg was another rude conception, chiefly noted among the Finns. The Indian form occurs in the Satapatha Brahmana.(2) The preservation of the human race in the Deluge, or the creation of the race after the Deluge, was yet another detail of savage mythology; and for many of these fancies we seemed to find a satisfactory origin in the exceedingly credulous and confused state of savage philosophy and savage imagination.|$|E
