5|$|The {{definition}} of real numbers as Cauchy sequences {{was first published}} separately by Eduard Heine and Georg Cantor, also in 1872. The above approach to decimal expansions, including the proof that 0.999... = 1, closely follows Griffiths & Hilton's 1970 work A comprehensive textbook of classical mathematics: A contemporary interpretation. The book is written specifically to offer <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> familiar concepts in a contemporary light.|$|E

And, you know, if my success means that other presses will take <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> these writers... and publish them in larger numbers, then our ship will come in.|$|E

40|$|The {{processes}} that will drive {{the next stage}} of the Czech transition are likely to be similar to those promoting real convergence in the EU cohesion countries. We draw on previous modelling research on the cohesion economies to construct and calibrate a small macrosectoral model of the Czech Republic that serves to highlight key policy issues facing CEE-country decision-makers. Four scenarios are then explored by simulation: the first projects the current pattern of disequilibrium wage setting into the future, while <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the consequences of labour market reform. The other scenarios highlight some of the differences between policy strategies based on indigenous versus FDI-driven export-led growth. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{son of the}} rector of Dallinghoo, Walford {{was educated}} at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a middle- or lower-order batsman, {{though it is not}} known whether he batted right- or left-handed. His two {{first-class}} matches came within a fortnight of each other in May 1860. In the first, scores of 7 and 25 for the Cambridge University team against the Cambridge Town Club were enough for the university team to want to take <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him, and he was duly picked for the MCC team to play against the university, a frequent ploy in university cricket at the time, but then failed to score in his only innings. Although he played in minor matches for the Cambridge team across the rest of the 1860 season, he was not picked for the University Match against Oxford University and played no further first-class games.|$|E

40|$|Blogging {{and social}} media’s {{contribution}} to a realignment {{of the relationship between}} journalists and their audiences is discussed by Einar Thorsen in Live Blogging and Social Media Curation. Journalists are facing challenges to preserve traditional standards, such as verification of information and sources, whilst also capitalising on the opportunities afforded by the immediacy, transparency and interactive nature of online communication. Thorsen analyses these issues through two case studies: one focuses on ‘live’ blogging and elections, and <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the role of social media in the Arab Spring. He demonstrates how journalists face new challenges in relation to social media curation, whilst the emergent forms and practices also present a wealth of opportunities...|$|R

500|$|Billboard {{magazine}} called the song [...] "a Pussycat Dolls-inspired contempo jam, high on hooks and of-the-moment production. Well done, {{if in the}} most generic sense." [...] About.com's Bill Lamb gave the song 4/5 stars, saying that with [...] "Say It Right", [...] "many pop music fans are likely to take <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> purchasing [...] ". He described the song as [...] "the foundation of Loose" [...] and [...] "a welcomed presence in the pop top 40". IGN Music calls the song [...] "...one of the brightest moments on the album" [...] and [...] "another throwback to the '80s" [...] which [...] "...lets loose with the most hypnotic chorus". Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered the song [...] "a dark meditative piece that would have fit on [...] previous records". The New York Times described the song as [...] "building a groove from hard drums and ghostly, multitracked voices, and Ms. Furtado sings a melancholy chorus she doesn't quite believe", comparing the coda, with music getting louder and then slowly fading, [...] "the way the best — and worst — nights out often do". Also, DJ Z's reviewed the song as [...] "the only single {{in the world to}} work at both a club in Manhattan, and on a safari through the natives land of (fill in the blank)." [...] The song received a nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards, losing to Amy Winehouse's [...] "Rehab".

500|$|Munsey's {{plan for}} the {{magazines}} was {{laid out in a}} note that appeared in the first four issues: [...] "This magazine is the answer to thousands of requests we have received over a period of years, demanding <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> famous fantasies which, since their original publication, have become accepted classics. [...] Our choice has been dictated by your requests and our firm belief that these are the aces of imaginative fiction." [...] The first issue included Ray Cummings' [...] "The Girl in the Golden Atom" [...] and A. Merritt's [...] "The Moon Pool", both popular stories by well-known authors. [...] Merritt's sequel, [...] "The Conquest of the Moon Pool", began serialization in the next issue, with illustrations by Virgil Finlay. [...] Finlay did many illustrations for Famous Fantastic Mysteries over its lifetime, and became one of its most popular artists. [...] Frank R. Paul began illustrating for the magazine with the third issue; he was not as capable an artist as Finlay but was very popular with the readers. [...] The first five covers were simply tables of contents, but with the sixth issue, dated March 1940, pictorial covers began, with Finlay the artist for that first cover. [...] Three early covers in 1940 were painted by Paul, but thereafter almost every cover was painted by either Finlay, Lawrence Stevens, or his son, Peter Stevens, including every single issue from February 1941 through April 1950. [...] The high quality of the artwork helped make the magazine {{one of the most popular}} of its day, and sf historian Thomas Clareson has suggested that it was Finlay's work in Famous Fantastic Mysteries and Fantastic Novels that made his reputation.|$|E
2500|$|Clifford Odets {{had been}} {{a close friend of}} Garfield from the early days in the Bronx. After Odets' one-act play Waiting for Lefty became a {{surprise}} hit, the Group announced it would mount a production of his full-length drama Awake and Sing. At the playwright's insistence, Garfield was cast as Ralph, the sensitive young son who pleads for [...] "a chance to get to first base." [...] The play opened in February 1935, and Garfield was singled out by critic Brooks Atkinson for having a [...] "splendid sense of character development." [...] Garfield's apprenticeship was officially over; he was voted full membership by the company. Odets was the man of the moment, and he claimed to the press that Garfield was his [...] "find" [...] and that he would soon write a play just for him. That play {{would turn out to be}} Golden Boy, but when Luther Adler was cast in the lead role instead, a disillusioned Garfield began to take <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the overtures being made by Hollywood.|$|E

2500|$|Rains filed a {{supplemental}} motion arguing that Judge Clay should take <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{a ruling that}} barred the defense attorney from presenting evidence about Grant's criminal background, {{as well as a}} ruling that barred him from presenting evidence that Mehserle told a fellow officer just before the shooting incident that he planned to use his Taser on Grant. He protested that [...] "Both rulings amount to grave errors under longstanding and never-questioned California authorities" [...] and alleged that they [...] "substantially interfere with Mehserle's federal due process right to defend against the murder charge." [...] Rains ailed to convince Judge Clay to remove District Attorney Tom Orloff's office from the case. Rains claimed Orloff violated his client's rights because he ordered two Oakland police officers to try to interview Mehserle after he was arrested, even though Orloff knew Mehserle had an attorney. Judge Clay said Orloff's actions did not prove a bias nor did it meet the requirements necessary for him to be removed from the case.|$|E

60|$|As the 'Skimmer of the Seas' thus spoke, he drew, {{with the}} calmness {{of a man}} who saw no use in circumlocution, a heavy bag of gold from beneath his frock, and {{deposited}} it, without <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the treasure, on the table.

It provides an overview of how the overarching aim of constructing an internal market has affected the location of political authority. [1] A first part examines how this discussion has developed generally, while <b>a</b> <b>second</b> part <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> current discussions regarding one of the areas that has been the hardest to integrate: financial services, and more particularly securities markets...|$|R
