5|$|Once General Tire {{sold the}} network in 1957, Mutual's {{ownership}} was largely {{disconnected from the}} stations it served, leading to a more conventional, top-down model of program production and distribution. Not long after the sale, one of the network's new executive teams was charged with accepting money to use Mutual {{as a vehicle for}} foreign propaganda. The network's reputation was severely damaged, but soon rebounded. Mutual changed hands frequently in succeeding years—even leaving aside larger-scale <b>acquisitions</b> <b>and</b> mergers, its final direct corporate parent, Westwood One, which purchased Mutual in 1985, was the seventh in a string of new owners that followed General Tire.|$|E

He {{then worked}} in Investment Management at ScotiaMcLeod from 2007 to 2010, where he managed {{portfolios}} of high-net-worth clients that were worth {{a total of}} about $120 million. After taking time off from his career to earn a Master of Business Administration, Vipond worked in Strategy and Corporate Development at the Vancouver-based Goldcorp Inc. from 2012 to 2015 where he made a $2.6 billion unsolicited bid to buy Osisko Mining. In 2013, while working at Goldcorp, Vipond founded Mathers Pacific Capital Inc., which is based in Vancouver. Mathers Pacific Capital works with Vancouver-area companies to help them raise capital, complete mergers and <b>acquisitions,</b> <b>and</b> grow their businesses. In March 2015, Vipond became Vice President of Corporate Finance at Shoes.com, while also continuing to run Mathers Pacific Capital and the Corporate Finance Institute, which is a subdivision of Mathers Pacific Capital. Prior to joining Shoes.com, Vipond worked as a consultant for its owner, Roger Hardy and in 2014, spearheaded the firm's purchase of Shoeme.ca and OnlineShoes.com.

It was the largest such private placement ever completed by a Canadian e-commerce company. In 2014, Vipond taught a one-day course on mining valuation at Sauder School of Business that involved working through a mining acquisition opportunity and the impact on such an mining investment.|$|E

Three- and 24 -month-old rats were classified into superior, moderate, and inferior {{groups on the}} basis of escape latencies during hidden platform <b>acquisition</b> <b>and</b> were compared regarding water maze <b>acquisition</b> <b>and</b> extinction, and open-field behavior. Unexpectedly, subgroup differences were invariant across age: The inferior and superior maze learners differed in (a) thigmotactic swimming during water maze <b>acquisition</b> <b>and</b> extinction and (b) open-field rearings. Thus, although aging has a detrimental effect on water maze <b>acquisition</b> <b>and</b> extinction, the degree of impairment might be partly determined by individual novelty-induced rearing activity and thigmotactic swimming at adult ages...|$|R

Participants in these groups were further subdivided into groups {{in which they were}} required to repeat what was said previously, were required to repeat random numbers, or no verbalizations were required. When correspondence was reinforced, repetition of what was said produced greater <b>acquisition</b> <b>and</b> generalization of correspondence. When noncorrespondence was reinforced, repetition of numbers facilitated <b>acquisition</b> <b>and</b> generalization of noncorrespondence.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades {{cognitive}} neuroscience {{got more and more}} interested in the topic of biligualism. The influence of Age of <b>Acquisition</b> <b>and</b> Proficiency Level became the question of most interest. Neuroimaging studies didnt consider an eventually different influence of the Age of <b>Acquisition</b> <b>and</b> the Proficiency Level on grammatical and semantical processes. This study investigated the influence of the Age of <b>Acquisition</b> <b>and</b> the Proficiency Level on the neural correlates of grammatical and semantic processes separately. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate neural activity of bilinguals (Italian-German) with different Age of <b>Acquisition</b> <b>and</b> Proficiency Level while processing grammatical and semantical judgments. While the patterns of cortical activity for grammatical processes were considerably influenced by the Age of Acquisition, patterns of cortical activity for semantical processes were more influenced by the proficiency level.
