25|$|Bothriolepis fossils {{are found}} in Middle and Late Devonian strata (from 387 to 360 million years ago). Because the fossils {{are found in}} {{freshwater}} sediments, Bothriolepis is presumed to have spent most of its life in freshwater rivers and lakes, but was probably able to enter salt water as well, because its range appeared to have corresponded with the Devonian continental coastlines. Many paleontologists hypothesize that they were anadromous, that is, they lived {{most of their lives}} in saltwater, and returned to freshwater only to breed, similar to salmon. Large groupings of Bothriolepis specimens have been found in Asia, Europe, Australia (Gogo Formation), Pennsylvania (Catskill Formation), Quebec (Escuminac Formation), Virginia (Chemung), Colorado, Cuche Formation (Boyacá, Colombia), <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>around</b> the world.|$|E

Both Caesar and Audacious were now directly exposed however to the heavy fire from Isla Verda, the batteries there <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>around</b> the bay now manned by French sailors who had evacuated the grounded ships of the line.

Spencer and Venerable, ordered to join the attack, were unable to take up their intended positions due to the absence of wind, Venerable losing its mizen-topmast to French shot as Hood attempted to wear his ship around.

500|$|During the mid-15th century, {{tapestry}} {{was one of}} {{the most}} expensive and prized artistic products in Europe. Commercial production proliferated across the Netherlands and northern France from the early 15th century, especially in the cities of Arras, Bruges and Tournai. The perceived technical ability of these artisans was such that, in 1517, Pope Julius II sent Raphael's cartoons to Brussels to be woven into hangings. Such woven wall hangings played a central political role as diplomatic gifts, especially in their larger format; Philip the Good gifted several to participants at the Congress of Arras in 1435, where the halls were draped from top to bottom <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>around</b> (tout autour) with tapestries showing scenes of the [...] "Battle and Overthrow of People of Liege". At Charles the Bold and Margaret of York's wedding the room [...] "was hung above with draperies of wool, blue and white, and on the sides was tapestried with a rich tapestry woven with the history of Jason and the Golden Fleece". Rooms typically were hung from ceiling to floor with tapestries and some rooms named for a set of tapestries, such as a chamber Philip the Bold named for a set of white tapestries with scenes from The Romance of the Rose. For about two centuries during the Burgundian period, master weavers produced [...] "innumerable series of hangings heavy with gold and silver thread, the like of which the world had never seen".|$|E
500|$|Pilotwings 64 {{was well}} {{received}} by most reviewers. The game's combination of 3D graphics, realistic settings, and flight simulation were applauded by many news sources and major gaming publications. In his release {{review of the}} Nintendo 64, The Seattle Times contributor Steven L. Kent found that the flight mechanics and vast areas featured in Pilotwings 64 make {{it one of the}} most impressive games ever made. Glenn Rubenstein of the website GameSpot summarized, [...] "The graphics, sound, control, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>around</b> excitement add up to make Pilotwings 64 one hell of a great ride." [...] Staff reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly, GamePro, and IGN all voiced positive comments on the game's polygon rendering and frame rates, as well as its sense of control and flying. Alex Constantides of Computer and Video Games enjoyed the game's large environments, exclaiming, [...] "You'll not believe just how huge the islands really are and, because certain elements are hidden at first, it'll take you months to see everything." [...] IGN's Levi Buchanan described this low-pressure, [...] "challenge without competition" [...] aspect of the game as a design philosophy adopted by later Nintendo titles such as Nintendogs. Rich Leadbetter of Maximum said that [...] "The sedate nature of the gameplay might not appeal to everyone, but the bottom line is that PilotWings 64 is an unparalleled test of skill, dexterity and control. It is a game that you must own and whilst not quite in the same league of 'must-have'itude as Super Mario 64, it remains an astounding achievement and another triumph for Nintendo." [...] A Next Generation critic remarked that once beyond the introductory missions the game becomes satisfyingly challenging, and succeeds as both a flight simulation and an example of Nintendo's surrealistic gameplay: [...] "It's a weird mix of total realism and self-conscious videogame elements, and the two don't grate." ...|$|E
