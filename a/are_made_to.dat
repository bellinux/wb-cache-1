Regular deployments <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> Singapore and RMAF Butterworth in Malaysia as part of Integrated Air Defence System exercises. In addition, RAAF F/A-18s have participated in exercises in the Philippines, Thailand and the United States.

5|$|For {{artifacts}} {{such as the}} Sky Disc of Nebra, {{alleged to}} be a Bronze Age artefact depicting the cosmos, the analysis {{would be similar to}} typical post-excavation analysis as used in other sub-disciplines in archaeology. An artefact is examined and attempts <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> draw analogies with historical or ethnographical records of other peoples. The more parallels that can be found, the more likely an explanation is to be accepted by other archaeologists.|$|E
5|$|Groups {{and lines}} of flowers {{are present in}} each level; {{approaching}} these with the petal causes them to bloom and a new petal to trail the first. When the player approaches certain flowers or groups of flowers, changes <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> the game world. These include opening new areas, transforming dead grassy areas to bright green fields, or activating wind turbines. These changes generally result in new flowers sprouting for the player to interact with. Flying through each flower results in a musical chime that harmonizes with the music. The music itself dynamically adjusts as changes <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> the world. The more flower petals the player has trailing the lead petal, the faster the petals move. It is impossible for the player to lose a level or any progress. The game features no enemies, hit points, or time limits. A single play-through of the game takes approximately one hour.|$|E
5|$|In the 1993 movie, The Remains of the Day, {{starring}} Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson and Christopher Reeve, references <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> Clevedon, {{where the}} final scene {{of the film is}} set and was filmed. The 1998 adaptation of Cider with Rosie also featured scenes filmed in the town. Scenes from the 2010 film, Never Let Me Go, starring Keira Knightley were filmed in Clevedon during the summer of 2009. Clevedon has its own comic book superhero, Captain Clevedon.|$|E

5|$|In the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, various {{references}} <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> Ragnarök. Ragnarök {{is first}} mentioned in chapter 26, where the throned figure of High, {{king of the}} hall, tells Gangleri (King Gylfi in disguise) some basic information about the goddess Iðunn, including that her apples will keep the gods young until Ragnarök.|$|E
5|$|More generally, {{people make}} {{a wide range}} of uses of insects, both {{practical}} and symbolic. On the other hand, attitudes to insects are often negative, and extensive efforts <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> kill them. The widespread use of insecticides has failed to exterminate any insect pest, but has caused resistance to commonly-used chemicals in a thousand insect species.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{designs for}} the Prophets, {{including}} the Hierarchs, were done by artist Shi Kai Wang. According to The Art of Halo, the Prophets were designed to look feeble, yet sinister. Originally, the Prophets appeared to be fused to the special hovering thrones they use for transport; even in the final designs, the Prophets <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> be dependent on their technology. Special headdresses, stylized differently {{for each of the}} Hierarchs, adds personality to the aliens and a regal presence.|$|E

5|$|The {{captured}} Lane expresses {{his belief}} that Jones is helping the prime universe to defeat the parallel one. Olivia tries to convince him of Jones' true intentions. Eventually, Lane agrees to show the Fringe team a location where he once met with Jones. The team raids the site but finds nothing; meanwhile, Lane escapes custody using his abilities. With only hours left until {{the next set of}} quakes, as projected by a watch that Lane was wearing, plans <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> shut down the bridge before this time runs out.|$|E
5|$|When {{translated}} into English for a publication by Methuen in 1963, {{a number of}} Francophone place-names were changed; for instance, the port of Saint-Nazaire was renamed Westermouth, which, according to author Michael Farr, was probably inspired by the real English coastal town of Weymouth. As the English-language translation was published after the English translation of other Tintin adventures, which had actually been authored later than The Seven Crystal Balls, in the English version, references <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> events that would occur in The Calculus Affair and The Red Sea Sharks.|$|E
5|$|Although Shankar {{initially}} {{claimed that}} Enthiran {{would be made}} for all audiences, including those lacking computer literacy, the film is influenced by and makes references to many scientific principles relating to the fields of engineering, computer science and robotics, including terabytes and Asimov's laws of robotics. Visual references <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> the science books A Briefer History of Time (2005) and Freakonomics (2005). In his book Visual Perception and Cultural Memory: Typecast and Typecast(e)ing in Malayalam Cinema, Sujith Kumar Parayil notes the similarities between Kalabhavan Mani's role in the film to the one Mani played in the Malayalam film Sallapam (1996).|$|E

5|$|Malmö FF {{made the}} {{transition}} from amateurism to full professionalism in the late 1970s {{under the leadership of}} club chairman Eric Persson. An open member association, the club's annual general meeting is the highest policy-making body. Each club member has one vote, so no shares are issued. The general meeting approves the accounts, votes to elect the chairman and other board members, and decides on incoming motions. The current chairman is Håkan Jeppsson, who has been chairman since 2010, when he replaced Bengt Madsen. The club's legal status means that any interest claims <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> the club, and not {{to the board of directors}} or club members. Day-to-day operations are overseen by a managing director, who liaises with the chairman.|$|E

5|$|Other public bills {{could no}} longer be vetoed; instead, they could be delayed for up to two years. This two-year period meant that {{legislation}} introduced in the fourth or fifth years of a parliament could be delayed until after the next election, which could prove an effective measure to prevent it being passed. Specifically, two years had to elapse between the second reading in the House of Commons in the first session and the passing of the bill in the House of Commons in the third session. The Speaker has to also certify that the conditions of the bill had been complied with. Significant restrictions on amendments <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> ensure that it is the same bill that has been rejected twice. The 1911 Act made clear that the life of a parliament could not be extended without the consent of the Lords.|$|E

5|$|The Miller {{brothers}} {{wrote the}} entire first novel, but were unsatisfied with the result; the Millers {{pointed out that}} writing a character for a novel is much harder than writing the characters of a game. Hyperion recruited author David Wingrove {{to assist with the}} project; the Millers ended up giving Wingrove a detailed draft, and the author rewrote the entire book. The book's design was made to fit the themes of the game; the novels <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> look like journals found in Myst, with embossed covers and pages darkened as though with time and use.|$|E
5|$|The text is a royal {{building}} inscription, a genre {{which had}} no equivalent in Old Persian literature. It illustrates how Cyrus co-opted local traditions and symbols to legitimize his conquest and control of Babylon. Many elements of the text were drawn from long-standing Mesopotamian themes of legitimizing rule in Babylonia: the preceding king is reprimanded and he is proclaimed to have been abandoned by the gods for his wickedness; the new king has gained power through the divine will of the gods; the new king rights the wrongs of his predecessor, addressing {{the welfare of the}} people; the sanctuaries of the gods are rebuilt or restored, offerings to the gods are made or increased and the blessings of the gods are sought; and repairs <b>are</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> the whole city, in the manner of earlier rightful kings.|$|E
