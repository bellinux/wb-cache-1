40|$|The {{kinetics}} of anti-paternal alloantibody {{production in}} syngeneically and <b>allogeneically</b> mated mice previously immunized with allogenic spleen cells has been investigated. In <b>allogeneically</b> mated females, total and cytotoxic alloantibody levels increased {{during the final}} 3 days of pregnancy to reach maximal levels around 1 week after parturition. The properties of this alloantibody were indistinguishable from those of alloantibody induced by conventional immunization procedures. In syngeneically mated females no increase was observed. Total hysterectomy demonstrated that the immunogenicity of the conceptus required to produce a secondary humoral immune response was initiated {{in the majority of}} females between days 9 and 10 of pregnancy, and that the antigenic exposure by day 10 was sufficient to induce a maximal secondary response. These observations were consistent with the time of appearance of serologically demonstrable H- 2 antigens on embryonic cells during pregnancy. These phenomena occurred in 'responder' and 'non-responder' female strains (referring to the ability of <b>allogeneically</b> mated females to produce anti-paternal alloantibody during normal pregnancy) demonstrating that they do not differ in their ability to produce a secondary immune response to alloantigens presented via the intrauterine route.

40|$|A MURINE {{model for}} acute lethal graft vs. host disease (GVHD) {{was used to}} study the role {{that a number of}} cytokines play in the {{development}} of lethal GVHD. In this study we focused on the role of IL- 1, IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 6, IFN- and TNF-. Lethally irradiated (C 57 BL CBA) F 1 mice were reconstituted either with 107 allogeneic BALB/c spleen cells or with a similar number of syngeneic cells, as a control. A significant rise in serum levels of IL- 6, TNF-g and IFN- levels was found in <b>allogeneically</b> reconstituted mice. This is in contrast to the syngeneic control group in which no rise was seen. Serum IL- 2 and IL- 4 levels were below the detection limit. In the supernatant of Con A stimulated spleen cells from <b>allogeneically</b> reconstituted mice IL- 6, IFN- and TNF- concentrations were increased. The expression of mRNA for cytokines as detected by reverse transcription PCR was studied in spleen cells. In the allogeneic reconstituted mice the mRNA expression of IL-lg, IL- 2, IL- 6, IFN- and TNF-g displayed faster kinetics compared with that in syngeneic reconstituted mice. The effect of treatment with recombinant cytokines, antibodies to cytokines and to cytokine receptors on the development of GVHD was investigated. Administration of recombinant IL- 2 to <b>allogeneically</b> reconstituted mice strongly increased the morbidity and mortality whereas injection of IL-lg and TNF-cz did not influence survival. Administration of antibodies against IL- 2 or the IL- 2 receptor decreased the morbidity and mortality. Anti-IL- 6, anti-IFN-, and anti-TNF-cz mAB, on the other hand, did not affect the morbidity and mortality of GVHD. The {{results of this study suggest}} successive waves of cytokine-secreting cell populations consistent with the induction of an inflammatory response in the development of acute GVH disease.

40|$|Cytotoxic cell {{activity}} {{directed against}} paternal alloantigens {{was investigated in}} primiparous C 57 BL/ 10 and CBA/Ca mice using a microcytotoxicity assay. Most <b>allogeneically</b> or syngeneically mated females lacked effector cells in their spleens or paraaortic lymph nodes both during pregnancy and immediately postpartum. However, spleen, cells from 33 % of C 57 BL/ 10 females mated to CBA/Ca males exhibited low levels of paternal target cell killing (P less than 0. 05 - 0. 01). Alloimmunization of virgin mice prior to mating resulted in only <b>allogeneically</b> mated females producing cytotoxic cells and alloantibody. These responses were not detectable during pregnancy but appeared immediately postpartum. The ability of pregnancy to induce memory cell formation was tested by allowing females one successful pregnancy before challenging them postpartum with allogeneic spleen cells. Kinetic studies of cytotoxic cell production showed that C 57 BL/ 10 females that had borne (C 57 BL/ 10 X CBA/Ca) F 1 litters responded earlier than their syngeneically mated sisters giving a peak response at 4 days compared to 7 days after immunization. This indicates that a single allogeneic pregnancy can prime the mother against paternal alloantigens suggesting that the conceptus is weakly immunogenic...|$|E

After absorption with mouse liver, red cells and thymocytes the antisera {{appeared to be}} cytotoxic for a subpopulation of peripheral T cells. The absorbed antisera blocked the immunosuppressor function of Con A-stimulated splenic lymphocytes, but was unreactive against Con A-stimulated and <b>allogeneically</b> primed cytotoxic cells, or helper T cells. Consequently, heteroantiserum against EL 4 may provide a useful reagent for the differentiation of cytotoxic from suppressor T-cell subsets...|$|E
40|$|Peptides from donor major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) molecules were examined for their activation of <b>allogeneically</b> primed T cells. After immunization with either allogeneic spleen cells or a skin allograft, primed T cells proliferate in response to peptides derived from polymorphic regions of alpha and beta chains of class II allo-MHC molecules. The results demonstrate that presentation of donor-MHC peptides by host-derived antigen-presenting cells is a common event in vivo. Thus, self-restricted T cell recognition of processed alloantigens may {{play a critical role}} in transplantation. An in-depth understanding of this response may result in the development of additional molecular therapies to combat allograft rejection...|$|E
40|$|Blood transfusions {{have been}} {{reported}} over the last 2 decades to decrease allograft rejection, to increase the rate of tumor growth, and to increase susceptibility to infectious complications. The effect of transfusions on macrophages, specifically on their regulation of lymphocyte proliferation, was investigated. Both macrophages and their supernatants obtained from transfused rats impaired lymphocyte blastogenesis {{to a greater degree}} than those from nontransfused rats. This effect was greatest when the lymphocytes were subjected to mitogen stimulation. The immunosuppression was seen with macrophages from both <b>allogeneically</b> and syngeneically transfused rats. Blood transfusions exert their immunosuppressive effect at least in part by increasing macrophage suppression of lymphocyte response to stimuli...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to evaluate whether the effect of environmental teratogens can be modified by maternal immunostimulation. Two chemicals, cyclophosphamide (CP) and 2, 3 -quinoxalinedimetanol, 1, 4 -dioxide (QD) were used as the reference teratogens (RT). The response to these RT was investigated in two animal models: (i) primigravid C 57 Bl/ 6 mice who underwent intrauterine immunization with allogeneic paternal (CBA/J), third-party (BALB/c) or syngeneic male splenocytes 21 days before mating; (ii) C 57 Bl/ 6 and CBA/J mice who were treated with RT during the second pregnancy only, after a different mating combination (syngeneic or allogeneic) {{in the first and}} the second pregnancy. Different doses of CP and QD were injected on days 12 and 9 of pregnancy, respectively. On day 19 of pregnancy implantation sites, resorptions, live and dead fetuses were recorded and live fetuses were examined for external and internal malformations with methods routinely used in teratological study. It was shown that intrauterine immunopotentiation with allogeneic paternal splenocytes clearly enhances the tolerance of F 1 embryos to RT. Thus, in CP-treated females the resorption rate and the proportion of malformed fetuses were significantly reduced. It was followed by an almost two-fold increase in fetal weight. The protective effect of such immunization in QD-treated females was manifested as a dramatic decrease of the proportion of malformed fetuses and the resorption rate. Syngeneic splenocytes could not significantly influence an embryo's sensitivity to RT. The response to RT was also significantly weaker in the second pregnancy of female mice mated twice <b>allogeneically</b> than that observed in <b>allogeneically</b> mated primigravid mice. These results show that the embryo's response to environmental teratogens may be influenced by fetomaternal immune interactions...|$|E
40|$|Cells {{from the}} spleen, thymus, lymph node, and liver of leukemic AKR mice {{suppress}} in vitro antibody responses of normal syngeneic and semiallogeneic cells. This suppression can be mediated by irradiated leukemic cells, requires cell contact between leukemic and normal cells, and may occur {{at any time}} during the in vitro culture period. Leukemic AKR cells do not suppress antibody responses of allogeneic cells, even when allogeneic cells have H- 2 or background genes homologous with AKR. Leukemic cells do, however, suppress cells that are unable to respond <b>allogeneically</b> to leukemic AKR cells, such as cells of the F 1 s of AKR. Suppression of normal AKR antibody responses by leukemic AKR cells may be overcome by addition of irradiated allogeneic cells. The fact that leukemic AKR cells are able to suppress normal lymphocyte responses may be of significance in pathogenesis of leukemia in these mice...|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the ability of}} foetal thymic epithelium depleted of lymphocytes and dendritic cells, by low temperature or deoxyguanosine (dGuo) treatment in organ culture, to reconstitute T-cell function in nude mice. It is shown that renal capsule grafts of either type could promote the development of functional T lymphocytes in the periphery, as judged by in vivo assays. Both syngeneic and allogeneic thymic epithelium endowed nude mice with the capacity to mount IgG antibody and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses to the T-dependent antigen ovalbumin (OVA). Functional reconstitution was accompanied {{by the appearance of}} Thy- 1 -bearing cells in the spleens of thymic grafted nude mice. The results from <b>allogeneically</b> grafted recipients show that a substantial population of peripheral T cells was present that collaborated with B cells and other antigen-presenting cells (APC) which do not express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules of the thymus donor haplotype...|$|E
40|$|Human {{graft-versus-host disease}} (GVHD) has several {{cutaneous}} manifestations, including a lichenoid and a sclerotic injury pattern. A versatile animal model of graft-versus-host skin disease (GVHSD) would facilitate {{study of the}} pathophysiology of these two cutaneous injury patterns. We have examined two murine chimeras histologically and have found two distinct patterns. <b>Allogeneically</b> transplanted B 1 / 6 mice show a prolonged lichenoid-interface dermatitis that eventuates in clinical alopecia, whereas LP/J recipients of allogeneic cells do not show hair loss. Their histopathology consists of an early lichenoid phase that abates and is replaced by dermal sclerosis. Because of the versatility of the mouse as a laboratory animal, we feel that this model provides an excellent opportunity to define the immunopathologic mechanisms responsible for skin injury in GVHD. In addition, {{an understanding of the}} pathogenesis of the T cell-dependent, lichenoid, and sclerotic patterns of tissue injury in GVHSD might well provide insight into the pathogenesis of the GVHSD analogs, cutaneous lupus erythematosus and scleroderma...|$|E
40|$|Humoral and {{cellular}} immune agents of a maternal reaction were investigated during pregnancy. Fluorescence studies performed on mouse placentae at 14 days detected maternal immunoglobulins of mainly IgG 1 but also IgG 2 subclasses. These immunoglobulins, after acid elution, can rebind the placenta and the thymocytes {{of the relevant}} paternal strain in case of allogeneic pregnancies, demonstrating an antibody activity towards both placenta specific and paternal strain antigens. They can specifically enhance a paternal strain tumour allograft on a maternal strain recipient. Spleen cells from an <b>allogeneically</b> pregnant mother can reduce or promote paternal strain tumour allograft on a maternal strain recipient. The aggressive effect is shown with small doses of transferred cells, whereas large doses promote enhancement. The suppression of the cytotoxic response of the recipient was ascribed to T cells by use of anti-theta plus complement. Thus, both the rejection reaction (immune cytotoxic cells) and the facilitation reaction (enhancing antibodies and suppressor cells) were demonstrated during pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|Fully {{allogeneic}} chimeras {{were able}} to develop in vitro alloantigen-specific, as well as H- 2 -restricted, Sendai virus-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response. Depending on the immunization regimen used, Sendai virus-specific CTL responses were restricted to the H- 2 antigens of either the stem cell donor or the thymus. Similarly, unprimed splenic T cells of normal mice were found to contain CTL-precursor cells that specifically reacted against Sendai virus or trinitrophenyl derivatives {{in the context of}} allogeneic major histocompatibility complex determinants that had not been encountered during their thymic differentiation. A frequency analysis of <b>allogeneically</b> versus syngeneically restricted virus-specific CTL precursors present in splenic T cells showed a ratio of about 1 to 6. These results provide evidence that H- 2 restriction of trinitrophenyl- or Sendai virus-specific T cells is dictated by the complex type of the antigen-presenting cell and thus appears to be independent of the type of thymus in which the T cells have undergone maturation...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that, in early pregnancy in mice, there {{is an increase in}} the number of immunoglobulin-secreting cells in the lymph nodes which drain the uterus. This paper describes the results of further investigations provoked by interest in these early changes. Increases in the numbers of immunoglobulin-secreting cells were observed in syngeneically, but scarcely or not at all in <b>allogeneically,</b> mated mice. Increases were not observed in surgically sterilized female mice inseminated by normal males. However, subcutaneous injection of sperm provoked massive increases in the numbers of immunoglobulin-secreting cells in the lymph nodes draining the injection site. The changes were compared with those provoked by the injection of spleen cells and LPS. The results are discussed in relation to the nature of the interactions provoking the increases in the number of immunoglobulin-secreting cells and their possible relationship to immunosuppression, and the relative immunological unresponsiveness which the female shows to the challenge of inseminated sperm...|$|E

The {{results indicated that}} allo-induced cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) contained effectors that lysed both hapten-self but not H-Y self targets. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that separate populations of those allogeneic CTL {{were responsible for the}} lysis of TNP-self and FITC-self targets. This study also showed that cytotoxic effectors generated against the H-Y antigen with lytic activity equal to or greater than that of an <b>allogeneically</b> induced CTL response were unable to lyse hapten-self targets. These findings provide the first evidence that H- 2 alloantigens may be unique in their ability to induce effectors that lyse hapten-conjugated autologous targets. These observations are discussed with respect to the self and foreign antigenic determinants involved in allogeneic and self-restricted CTL models...|$|E
40|$|Mammalian {{pregnancy}} {{is a unique}} immunological paradox because the fetus, which bears paternal histocompatible antigens which are alien to the maternal immune system can survive normally as an allograft in the mother. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain fetal acceptance including nonspecific suppression of maternal immunity (1). Previous {{studies have suggested that}} factors in pregnant sera {{play a role in the}} suppression of maternal immunity (2 - 9), including sex hormones (2, 3), serum-blocking antibody (4), pregnancy-associated proteins (5), a-fetoprotein (6, 7), and as yet undefined factors. However, none of these have been established as a major factor in the suppressed maternal immunity. Moreover, contradictory results have been recently reported by Smith (8) and Hamilton and Hellstr/Sm (9), who claim that sera from syngeneically or <b>allogeneically</b> pregnant mice do not inhibit the responses of normal lymphocytes to alloantigens. The reasons for these discrepancies are unclear. Other evidence which suggests suppressed maternal immunity during pregnancy includes depressed mixed lymphocyte reactions (10), diminished mitogen responses (6, 11), decreased leukocyte migration (12), and delaye...|$|E
40|$|Adding mitomycin-treated spleen {{cells from}} an allopregnant mouse to a material-strain cells v. paternal-strain cells MLR was {{previously}} shown {{to decrease the}} intensity of the reaction, due to suppressor T cells. In the present study, spleen cells from <b>allogeneically</b> pregnant mice, were added without treatment at day 2 of an MLR of maternal strain responder cells raised against paternal-strain stimulators. It was shown that, while, on 2 day duration culture versus the same stimulator cells these cells are hyper-reactive compared to controls, yet they lead to a MLR of lower intensity than when the same operation was performed with control cells. This suppressive effect is T-cell dependent and use of high dilutions of anti-Thy 1 +C suggests that the suppressor cell has a high density of Thy 1 surface antigen. Involvement of these cells in negative regulation of the late phase of the MLR is suggested. MLRs with cells from allopregnant mice as responders were themselves susceptible to this suppression and even more so than cells from virgin mice, indicating a possible physiological role...|$|E
40|$|Collaboration between thymus or thymus-derived {{lymphocytes}} and nonthymusderived precursors of antibody-forming ceils {{has been}} implicated in the immune response of mice to sheep erythrocytes (SRBC) I (1 - 3). Neonatal thymectomy impairs the response of mice to SRBC, and this can be reversed by inoculating thymus or thoracic duct lymphocytes simultaneously with SRBC (4, 5). In this system, thymus cells were as effective as thoracic duct cells and semiallogeneic cells were also effective. The identity of the antibody-forming cells produced was determined by using anti-H 2 sera in <b>allogeneically</b> reconstituted hosts and chromosome marker analysis in a syngeneic system. These techniques demonstrated that the antibody-forming cells were, in general, derived not from the inoculated lymphocytes, but from cells already present in thymectomized hosts. Irradiated recipients of lymphoid cells from various sources were used to identify the precursors of antibody-forming cells. Thymus cells given together with SRBC failed to produce antibody-forming cells in irradiated mice, even when injected in very large numbers. A synergistic effect between thymus and marrow cells has, however, been described in such mice (6). By means of a chromosom...|$|E
40|$|Immunological {{enhancement}} {{is a form}} {{of active}} immunoregulation in which humoral antibodies suppress primary sensitization or block reaction in sensitized animals. In mouse serum the antibodies that suppress sensitization in mice (allogeneic enhancement) are predominantly 7 Sgamma 1 and those that block reaction 7 Sgamma 2 globulins. But {{little is known about the}} identity of xenogeneic enhancing antibodies, e. g. guinea-pig antibodies that can suppress sensitization in mice. We have studied these here as specifically effective against induction of tuberculin-typed delayed hypersensitivity to chicken conalbumin antigen. Guinea-pigs required prolonged and intense immunization with conalbumin to produce readily measurable titres of such antibodies. Their capacity to suppress mouse sensitization was antigenically specific. Of the three major classes of antibodies separated from the immunosuppressive guinea-pig antisera, the IgG 2 globulins were the most effective. These antibodies lost immunosuppressiveness if digested to either F(ab.) 2 or Fab fragments that retained antigen-binding capacities. Thus, we provide here an example of xenogeneic antibody-mediated contrasensitization, show that only intact antibody molecules are effective, and demonstrate that immunosuppressiveness is concentrated in different immunoglobulin classes for xeno- and <b>allogeneically</b> used antisera...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} that lymphocytes sensitized to cell-associated antigens may be rendered hyporeactive toward cells expressing these antigens by prior incubation with such antigens in soluble form was investigated. Mice were sensitized {{to the foreign}} histocompatibility antigens of an allogeneic strain of mice; lymphocytes from such sensitized mice were incubated with serum from normal mice of the sensitizing, sensitized, and F 1 hybrids of the two strains. These lymphocytes were washed and their in vitro activity against preparations of cells of sensitizing strain origin was measured by modifications of a standard assay. Sera from the sensitizing strain, and from F 1 hybrids of the sensitizing and sensitized strains (which {{would be expected to}} contain the soluble histocompatibility antigens to which the lymphocytes were sensitized), abrogated the in vitro activity of lymphocytes against target cells of the sensitizing strain, while serum from the sensitized strain did not. Soluble tumor-specific or histocompatibility antigens may be responsible in part for the specific abrogation of sensitized lymphocyte activity by serum from tumorbearing, successfully allografted, <b>allogeneically</b> pregnant, or chimeric animals...|$|E
40|$|Products of {{the major}} {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) 1 {{play a key role}} in the functional specificity of cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL). <b>Allogeneically</b> stimulated CTL have specificity primarily for products of the H- 2 K and H- 2 D loci of the mouse histocompatibility 2 (H- 2) complex (1). A high proportion of CTL precursors appear to be committed to react with these allogeneic MHC gene products (2 - 4). The role of MHC products as target specificities for CTL was further elucidated by the experiments of Doherty et al. (5). These investigators showed that CTL specific for viral antigens required the presence of the stimulating H- 2 product on the target cell, as well as the inducing viral determinants, to effect cytolysis. This observation also applied to syngeneic systems in which CTL were induced to chemically modified syngeneic cells (6), non-H- 2 - 1 inked histocompatibility determinants (7), and tumor-specific transplantation antigens (8, 9). Shearer (10) originally demonstrated that CTL could be induced in vitro by trinitrophenyl (TNP) -modified syngeneic cells and showed that these CTL onl...|$|E
40|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{elucidate}} the mechanism by which HIV transmission is increased following obstetrical hemorrhage. We investigated whether fetal allostimulation of maternal cells, which could occur following fetal-to-maternal hemorrhage, increases proliferation, HIV replication, and cellular activation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from HIV-infected mothers and their infants to assess maternal-fetal allostimulation. Responses were compared to allostimulation with unrelated donors. Maternal and fetal cells were cocultured to assess allogeneic stimulation. Cell proliferation was measured by [3 H]thymidine incorporation and cell activation was assessed via fluorochrome-labeled antibody staining and flow cytometric analysis. Virus production from HIV-infected maternal cells was quantitated by p 24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or by branched chain DNA assay. Allostimulation with fetal cells led to maternal cell proliferation. In women with unsuppressed viral loads, virus release was also enhanced following allostimulation of maternal cells with fetal cells. Fetal cells are capable of <b>allogeneically</b> stimulating maternal cells, with responses comparable to those seen following allostimulation with unrelated donors. Allostimulation of maternal cells by fetal cells results in statistically significant increases in proliferation and enhanced HIV replication, suggesting a possible physiological mechanism for mother-to-child transmission of HIV in women with obstetrical hemorrhage...|$|E

Ideally, any such analysis requires the testing of immunocompetent B cells under conditions in which the minimally required set of cooperating elements can be qualitatively and quantitatively defined. Several years ago, we reported (2 - 5) on the in vitro conditions for which antigen-specific, <b>allogeneically</b> restricted Hf triggers unprimed B cells to generate primary IgM responses to soluble serum proteins and, more recently, to histocompatibility antigens expressed on the surface of chicken erythrocytes (CRBC). We have further developed this system to the point where as few as 2, 000 unprimed B cells selected for immunocompetence to a given histocompatibility haplotype by rosetting with the appropriate CRBC generate a powerful, Hf-dependent in vitro immunoglobulin M (IgM) response.

The mature protein is predicted to have an unglycosylated Mr of approximately equal to 26, 000 and contains a single potential site for N-linked glycosylation. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of clone HSE 26. 1 are homologous with all murine and human serine esterases cloned thus far but are most similar to mouse granzyme B (70 % nucleotide and 68 % amino acid identity). HSE 26. 1 protein is expressed weakly in unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells but is strongly induced within 6 -hr incubation in medium containing phytohemagglutinin.

The pathogenesis of obliterative bronchiolitis is poorly understood, and successful preventative or treatment strategies are not available. We sought to develop a preclinical model system of obliterative bronchiolitis by transplanting murine airway grafts, consisting of tracheas and main bronchi, into the subcutaneous tissue of <b>allogeneically</b> mismatched recipient animals. By 10 days after transplantation, allografts demonstrated subepithelial and/or peritracheal inflammation, epithelial necrosis, and early fibroproliferation. Grafts harvested 21 days after transplantation demonstrated fibroproliferation in the airway wall or lumen in nine of 10 allografts versus 0 of 10 isografts (P = 0. 0001). In addition, abnormal epithelium (ie, nonciliated cuboidal, squamous, or absent) was seen in all allografts, while nine of nine isografts demonstrated normal respiratory epithelium (P = 0. 0003). Although differences exist between this model and the chronic rejection process in human lung transplant recipients, these findings reproduce the characteristic features of obliterative bronchiolitis and demonstrate that this lesion can result from allograft rejection.

Detection of binding was dependent upon aggregate size with complexes of more than 100 IgG molecules being optimal, aggregates of 6 – 25 detecting splenocytes but not thymocytes, and aggregates of less than 6 binding to a negligible extent.

For developing therapies to be clinically translated, it is imperative to understand how donor characteristics, such as age, affect the efficacy of MSC- based treatments. The overall aim {{of this study was to}} characterize age-related changes in MSCs from bone marrow using a murine model. First, the conditions for isolation and in vitro expansion were optimized for bone marrow- derived MSCs; MSCs were isolated from C 57 Bl/ 6 mice of varying age (three-week, two-month, six-month, ten-month, and thirteen-month old). Second, donor age-dependent changes in expansion ability were determined by investigating the population doubling time and colony- forming capability of MSCs from various age groups. Cell populations from older mice proliferated more quickly and produced more colonies than their younger counterparts. Finally, age-related changes in MSC functionality and differentiation potential were investigated. Migration rate, antioxidant levels, and cytoskeletal dynamics of each population were determined. It was found that the older populations had faster migration and more dynamic cytoskeletons, while the younger cells had higher antioxidant activity. The cells were also subjected to chondrogenic, osteogenic, and adipogenic assays.

Healthy control rats, rats with acute CSA nephrotoxicity, rats with acute tubular necrosis, syngeneically transplanted (sTX) rats, and aTX rats treated with CSA since postoperative day 0 served as controls. After surgery, renal glu-cose metabolism was assessed in vivo serially up to postoper-ative day 7 by performing small-animal PET 3 h after intravenous injection of 30 MBq of 18 F-FDG. Mean radioactivity (cps/mm 3 of tissue) was measured and the percentage injected dose cal-culated. Results were confirmed by histologic, functional, and autoradiographic analysis. Results: Renal 18 F-FDG uptake was significantly elevated at postoperative day 4 in aTX rats, when compared with control, sTX, acute tubular necrosis, or CSA-treated rats (P, 0. 05). In vivo 18 F-FDG uptake correlated with the re-sults of autoradiography and with inflammatory infiltrates ob-served on histologic examination. Notably, 18 F-FDG PET assessed the response to therapy 48 h earlier than the time at which serum creatinine decreased and when histologic exami-nation still showed signs of allograft rejection. In aTX rats, the CSA-susceptible graft infiltrate was dominated by activated cytotoxic T cells and monocytes/macrophages. Conclusion: 18 F-FDG PET is an option to noninvasively assess early response to therapy in rat renal allograft rejection...|$|E
40|$|Mouse and vole embryos were <b>allogeneically</b> and xenogeneically {{transferred}} into pseudopregnant CD- 1 and immunodeficient (scid) female mice, and {{we investigated}} {{the distribution of}} immunocompetent cells, uterine natural killer (uNK) cells, mast cells and macrophages, in the implantation sites on days 6, 7 and 8 of gestation. The survival rate of the vole embryos decreased gradually with increased gestation, but the rate was higher in the scid uteri than in the CD- 1 mice. The number of uNK cells increased markedly at the mesometrial triangle and the outer decidual area in the CD- 1 uteri containing vole embryos; by contrast, scid uteri having vole embryos showed almost the same number as those having mouse embryos. Mast cells were present in large numbers at the myometrium, but rarely in the decidua in all types of pregnant uteri. Cells at the myometrium were more numerous in xenogeneic than in allogeneic transfer. Many mast cells appeared in the inner decidua where xenogeneically transferred vole embryos were dead and aborted. Macrophages {{were present in the}} outer decidua and myometria in all types of pregnant uteri, and their distribution pattern did not change even in aborted uterine sites. These results suggest: (1) the response of macrophages to dead embryos is completely inhibited, (2) uNK cells and mast cells increase near dead and aborted embryos, and (3) the increment in uNK cells responding to xenogeneic embryos is suppressed in scid mice, and the suppression may contribute partly to survival of the embryos...|$|E
40|$|Mixed <b>allogeneically</b> reconstituted mice (B 10 + B 10. D 2 [...] B 10) that {{specifically}} accept B 10. D 2 tail skin allografts were examined for in vivo and in vitro immunocompetence, patterns of hematopoietic repopulation, and in vitro reactivity. In vitro, mixed allogeneic chimeras (B 10 + B 10. D 2 [...] B 10) manifested specific tolerance in mixed lymphocyte reactions and cell-mediated lympholysis to B 10 and B 10. D 2 splenocytes, with normal responses to third-party (B 10. BR) cells. Such chimeras were immunocompetent in B cell and helper T cell responses, as assessed by their primary plaque forming cell responses to in vivo sheep {{red blood cell}} immunization. This {{is in contrast to}} fully allogeneic chimeras, which responded less well. In addition, survival of the mixed allogeneic chimeras in a conventional animal facility was superior to that of fully allogeneic chimeras, and similar to syngeneically reconstituted (B 10 [...] B 10) mice. Specific tolerance to skin grafts, degree of allogeneic engraftment, and persistence of chimerism was also assessed in a noncongenic mixed allogeneic combination (B 10 + C 3 H [...] B 10). Such animals manifested specific hyporeactivity to C 3 H skin allografts, but eventual chronic rejection of the grafts occurred in spite of stable and persistent mixed chimerism. MHC-congenic (B 10. BR) skin grafts were accepted indefinitely in the same animals, suggesting that skin-specific non-major histocompatibility complex antigens were responsible for rejection of the C 3 H skin allografts...|$|E
40|$|Beta-thalassemia is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} with mutations in the -globin gene that reduce or abolish -globin protein production. Patients with -thalassemia major (Cooley’s anemia) become severely anemic by 6 to 18 months of age, and are transfusion dependent for life, while those with thalassemia intermedia, a less-severe form of thalassemia, are intermittently or rarely transfused. An <b>allogeneically</b> matched {{bone marrow transplant}} is curative, although it is restricted to those with matched donors. Gene therapy holds the promise of “fixing ” one’s own bone marrow cells by transferring the normal -globin or -globin gene into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to permanently produce normal red blood cells. Requirements for effective gene transfer {{for the treatment of}} -thalassemia are regulated, erythroid-specific, consistent, and high-level -globin or -globin expression. Gamma retroviral vectors have had great success with immune-deficiency disorders, but due to vector-associated limitations, they have limited utility in hemoglobinopathies. Lentivirus vectors, on the other hand, have now been shown in several studies to correct mouse and animal models of thalassemia. The immediate challenges of the field as it moves toward clinical trials are to optimize gene transfer and engraftment of a high proportion of genetically modified HSCs and to minimize the adverse consequences that can result from random integration of vectors into the genome by improving current vector design or developing novel vectors. This article discusses {{the current state of the}} art in gene therapy for -thalassemia and some of the challenges it faces in human trials...|$|E
40|$|Helper and {{suppressor}} {{cells have}} been identified in lymph nodes of multiparous pregnant mice using one-way mixed lymphocyte reactions. Primiparous C 57 Bl and C 57 Bl/ 10 ScSn females during pregnancy and immediately post-partum gave unaltered MLR reactivity compared to virgin controls when stimulated with paternal or third-party alloantigens. In contrast, multiparity produced strain-dependent alterations in responsiveness: C 57 Bl females being hyporesponsive while C 57 Bl/ 10 ScSn mice were hyper-responsive to these antigens. To evaluate regulator activity, the cells were treated with mitomycin C and mixed with normal syngeneic MLR responder populations. Results showed that mixtures of para-aortic and inguinal lymph node cells from pregnant C 57 Bl females suppressed while those from pregnant C 57 Bl/ 10 ScSn increased normal virgin MLR responses. Treatment of the regulator cells with anti-Thy- 1. 2 plus complement showed that suppressor activity was predominantly non-T cell in nature while C 57 Bl/ 10 ScSn helper activity was wholly T cell-dependent. The regulator cells appeared to be non-specific since they were found in syngeneically as well as <b>allogeneically</b> mated females but covert specificity could not be totally excluded. Embryo resorption in the C 57 Bl strain was associated with helper rather than suppressor activity. These results suggest that suppressor cells are not essential for the maintenance of pregnancy and that the presence of regulator cells probably reflects the normal homeostatic mechanisms controlling the maternal immune response to the conceptus...|$|E
40|$|In vitro {{recombination}} of cloned H- 2 genes {{resulted in}} two <b>allogeneically</b> novel mouse transplantation antigens {{in which the}} C 2 domains of H- 2 Ld and H- 2 Dd were exchanged. These genes were introduced into mouse L cells by DNA-mediated gene transfer. We have used these transformed fibroblast lines, expressing recombinant H- 2 antigens at normal levels, as targets for alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Transformed cell lines expressing native or hybrid H- 2 molecules that share the N and C 1 domains but not the C 2 domain were lysed to an equivalent degree by primary and secondary anti-H- 2 Dd CTL. Hybrid and native H- 2 antigens that have the same N and C 1 domains were capable of reciprocally blocking specific lysis by the CTL. Thus, polymorphic determinants recognized by alloreactive T cells are located primarily in the N domain, the C 1 domain, or both domains of the H- 2 antigen. In contrast, determinants recognized by monoclonal antibodies are present throughout the H- 2 protein, including the C 2 domain. Antibodies that bind specifically to the C 2 domain effectively inhibited CTL activity, possibly due to steric effects. The same antibodies do not competitively inhibit the binding of N/C 1 -specific antibodies. The predominant reactivity of CTL to the N and C 1 domains suggests that humoral and cellular responses "see" a different spectrum of alloantigenic determinants...|$|E
