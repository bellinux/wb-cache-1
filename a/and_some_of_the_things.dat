60|$|I {{sometimes}} wish {{in these}} later years that I had spent less time in it, or that world of books which it opened into; that I had seen {{more of the}} actual world, and had learned to know my brethren in it better. I might so have amassed more material for after use in literature, but I had to fit myself to use it, and I suppose {{that this was what}} I was doing, in my own way, and by such light as I had. I often toiled wrongly and foolishly; but certainly I toiled, and I suppose no work is wasted. Some strength, I hope, was coming to me, even from my mistakes, and though I went over ground that I need not have traversed, if I had not been left so much to find the way alone, yet I was not standing still, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that I then wished to do I have done. I do not mind owning that in others I have failed. For instance, I have never surpassed Shakespeare as a poet, though I once firmly meant to do so; but then, it is to be remembered that very few other people have surpassed him, and that {{it would not have been}} easy.|$|E

I was actually driving to the studio {{to work on this}} other song we started, and I had most of it the chorus in my head, and it felt like I had most of the song in my head — the verses just had to flesh out. I walked into the studio and played the chord progression, and he built this track really quickly, and then I could sing over the top of it". He continued and said [...] "it was just a very quick, quick song to write, because I literally thought about Nic and I and our relationship in the beginning, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> we had said all went into that song." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an October 1986 interview, Miller {{discussed}} Mitch Easter's role as producer:He helps {{from the}} technical end, {{not from the}} artistic end. He doesn't say, [...] "You're {{going to need a}} lot of backing vocals here" [...] or [...] "Use this guitar on this." [...] I usually do most of that stuff. I'd say I end up doing half of the production myself. He does pretty much all of the engineering <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> you'd call production. Like he decides where you stand when you do the vocals, and you know, [...] "We're going to have a nylon stocking between you and the microphone," [...] some tricks like that. He'll do things like say [...] "No, that vocal track wasn't good, let's do it again." [...] He makes a lot of quality decisions, he sort of figures out what we want and has in his head what he thinks a good pop record's gonna be and works toward that. Also, he knows how to use all his equipment precisely and utterly.|$|E
5000|$|Speaking {{about the}} 1990s in an interview, Susan Ottaviano stated, [...] "Melody {{was sort of}} falling by the wayside and getting into {{a little bit more}} of the riffs <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that we didn't fit as well, and I think that also we were having the growing pains in the band and in general about how to move forward." [...] In a 2013 interview, Ted Ottaviano explained, [...] "I wouldn't just say that grunge killed it. I just think it wasn't {{apparent}} that basically, musically, audiences had changed and they wanted to hear different things. We did. We were as much of a music participant as anyone else. Most of the electronic music became more dance oriented, and techno and house industrial went towards that direction, and then more alternative music went back to a really traditional sort of almost rock or post-punk sort of vein. It felt like the synth pop songs that we were doing didn't feel like they had a place at that moment, in a strange way, even for us. You could feel the tide change. We could've continued going on if we wanted to, we just basically felt we had sort of done our thing at that point." ...|$|E

50|$|All {{three cases}} are solved by Judge Dee, the {{district}} magistrate, detective, prosecutor, judge, and jury {{all wrapped up}} into one person. His powers are vast, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> he can do would be manifestly illegal in a Western judicial system - such as grossly intimidating a witness or suspect, {{up to and including}} the extraction of a confession by torture. As against that, making a false judgement could be far more perilous to Dee's kind of magistrate than to a modern western one. Exhuming a dead body without proving that the dead person was murdered would be an act of Sacrilege which would the cost the Judge his job (which very nearly happens to Dee {{in the course of the}} book). If the judge had sentenced a person to death and the executed person prove afterwards to have been innocent, the Judge would be himself executed - having made an honest mistake would not be a sufficient plea to save him. Should an innocent person die under torture, both the judge ordering the torture and all members of staff administering the torture would suffer the capital punishment - and members of Dee's staff urging him to cease torture when the suspect proves obdurate shows that they are aware of that dire risk to themselves.|$|E
5000|$|Remy Verhoeve of The Huffington Post said, [...] "A Dance with Dragons {{is just a}} book, of course. It is not the Second Coming or anything. And I {{understand}} that the author must feel {{a lot of pressure}} concerning this one (he should). It's late and it has to repair some of the damage done by A Feast for Crows, which frankly felt as if it was written by a ghost writer at times. Finally it is here, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> we've been wondering about {{for more than a decade}} are actually revealed (not everything, but at least some things). It has the same structural problems as the previous book; it is sprawling and incoherent at times, but at least the characters are more interesting than in the previous installment. It does feel like I'm reading a bunch of separate stories within the same setting-the chapters are told through the eyes of various characters-but that doesn't really bother me as I love the setting and like to see it through various points of view. Theories that have been bandied about online for the last ten years mostly come true in this book, so in that respect the novel isn't shocking but neither is it disappointing. Martin also manages to put in a few twists, but ends the book much like he did the previous one with cliffhangers instead of wrapping things up a little better so the next long wait won't hurt so much." ...|$|E
