25|$|Chidley's further {{contributions}} to controversy mirrored the developing {{political and military}} situation. The onset of the English Civil War forced the House of Commons of England on 6 September 1642 to pledge the abolition of episcopacy and unification with the Church of Scotland, although the practical working out of such a scheme was remitted to the Westminster Assembly of Divines. However, series of disasters for the Parliamentarians during 1643 forced acceptance of the Solemn League and Covenant, sworn by both Houses of Parliament on 22 September, committing England to a Presbyterian polity headed by the king. In {{the last months of}} 1644, with Parliament's situation increasingly secure, the Assembly of Divines brought forward proposals for the Presbyterian reorganisation, embodied in two reports or <b>advices</b> <b>to</b> Parliament: debate was scheduled for January 1645. Chidley recommenced hostilities with Edwards at this point by publishing A New-Yeares-Gift, or a Brief Exhortation to Mr. Thomas Edwards; that he may breake off his old sins, in the old yeare, and begin the New yeare, with new fruits of Love, first to God, and then to his Brethren. This sought to combat damaging claims he had made about the conduct of Independents in Antapologia, an attack on five dissenting members of the Westminster Assembly who were sympathetic to the Independents. Edwards had used smear tactics, seeking to conflate numerous disparate strands of dissent, all of which he claimed were proliferating under the noses of Parliamentarians.|$|E
2500|$|Later in 643, however, Li Chengqian {{was found}} to have plotted with Hou to {{overthrow}} Emperor Taizong, as he was apprehensive that Emperor Taizong would displace him with Li Tai. [...] Emperor Taizong executed Hou and the other coconspirators, while deposing and exiling Li Chengqian (although he also blamed Li Tai's machinations for Li Chengqian's downfall and exiled him as well, creating their younger brother Li Zhi crown prince instead). [...] As Wei had previously repeatedly recommended Hou and Du Zhenglun, a key advisor to Li Chengqian who was also exiled, as chancellor material, Emperor Taizong suspected Wei of factionalism. [...] Also, it was discovered at the time that Wei had recorded his adverse <b>advices</b> <b>to</b> Emperor Taizong and given them to Chu, who was the imperial historian as well, displeasing Emperor Taizong further. [...] He therefore cancelled the planned marriage between Princess Hengshan and Wei Shuyu and destroyed the stone monument that he had commissioned for Wei.|$|E
2500|$|He {{began his}} career as Prime Minister with verbal attacks (speech at his appointment) against Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj and the {{nationalisation}} of the 15% share of Mongolian companies in the Tavantolgoi mine, making it a 100% public venture, thus inducing enthusiasm of Russian companies in the large coal deposit. Most of the members of a three-party coalition government, led by Bayar and dominated by the MPRP, were approved by Parliament on 5 December 2007; the government included Bayar's predecessor, Miyeegombyn Enkhbold, as Deputy Prime Minister. This government was planned to serve until the June 2008 parliamentary election. On 11 September 2008, following the MPRP's victory in the June parliamentary election, S. Bayar was elected as the new Prime Minister of a coalition government between the MPRP and DP. Under his leadership, the Mongolian Government finally signed an investment agreement to mine the Oyu Tolgoi copper deposit. The deal was later revealed that in fact it was in favor of the investors. According to some sources, after his resignation he moved to the US and bought several properties on his daughter and relatives names. Later it was found that he has several offshore accounts. It is believed that he still has influences on MPP which is confirmed by a leaked video footage in which he gives <b>advices</b> <b>to</b> Miyegombo Enkhbold, the official head of the party, for his presedential election speech preparation.|$|E

60|$|This letter stunned me. I {{could not}} think it {{possible}} for any one that had not dealt with the devil to write such a letter, for he spoke of some particular things which afterwards were to befall me with such an assurance that it frighted me beforehand; and when those things did come to pass, I was persuaded he had some more than human knowledge. In a word, his <b>advices</b> <b>to</b> me to repent were very affectionate, his warnings of evil {{to happen to me}} were very kind, and his promises of assistance, if I wanted him, were so generous that I have seldom seen the like; and though I did not at first set much by that part because I looked upon them as what might not happen, and as what was improbable to happen at that time, yet all the rest of his letter was so moving that it left me very melancholy, and I cried four-and-twenty hours after, almost without ceasing, about it; and yet even all this while, whatever it was that bewitched me, I had not one serious wish that I had taken him. I wished heartily, indeed, that I could have kept him with me, but I had a mortal aversion to marrying him, or indeed anybody else, but formed a thousand wild notions in my head that I was yet gay enough, and young and handsome enough, to please a man of quality, and that I would try my fortune at London, come of it what would.|$|E
60|$|Pain has {{the same}} {{efficacy}} and use to set us on work that pleasure has, we being as ready to employ our faculties to avoid that, as to pursue this: only this is worth our consideration, that pain is often produced by the same objects and ideas that produce pleasure in us. This their near conjunction, which makes us often feel pain in the sensations where we expected pleasure, gives us new occasion of admiring the wisdom and goodness of our Maker, who, designing the preservation of our being, has annexed pain to the application of many things to our bodies, to warn us of the harm that they will do, and as <b>advices</b> <b>to</b> withdraw from them. But he, not designing our preservation barely, but the preservation of every part and organ in its perfection, hath in many cases annexed pain to those very ideas which delight us. Thus heat, that is very agreeable to us in one degree, by a little greater increase of it proves no ordinary torment: and the most pleasant of all sensible objects, light itself, if there {{be too much of}} it, if increased beyond a due proportion to our eyes, causes a very painful sensation. Which is wisely and favourably so ordered by nature, that when any object does, by the vehemency of its operation, disorder the instruments of sensation, whose structures cannot but be very nice and delicate, we might, by the pain, be warned to withdraw, before the organ be quite put out of order, and so be unfitted for its proper function for the future. The consideration of those objects that produce it may well persuade us, that this is the end or use of pain. For, though great light be insufferable to our eyes, yet the highest degree of darkness does not at all disease them: because that, causing no disorderly motion in it, leaves that curious organ unarmed in its natural state. But yet excess of cold as well as heat pains us: because it is equally destructive to that temper which is necessary to the preservation of life, and the exercise of the several functions of the body, and which consists in a moderate degree of warmth; or, if you please, a motion of the insensible parts of our bodies, confined within certain bounds.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} {{proportions of}} provider <b>advice</b> <b>to</b> quit smoking for Asian-American smokers and to describe {{factors that may}} affect the provision of such advice. Design. Secondary data analysis of population-based survey. Setting. California. Subjects. Current smokers from the California Tobacco Use Surveys for Chinese-Americans (n = 2117, participation rate = 52 %), Korean-Americans (n = 2545, participation rate = 48 %), and Vietnamese-Americans (n = 2179, participation rate = 63. 5 %). Measures. Sociodemographics including insurance status, smoking frequency, provider visit in past year, and provider <b>advice</b> <b>to</b> quit. Analysis. Multivariate logistic regression models examined dependent outcomes of (1) provider visit in past year and (2) provider <b>advice</b> <b>to</b> quit. Results. Less than a third (30. 5 %) of smokers in our study reported both seeing a provider (50. 8 %) and then receiving <b>advice</b> <b>to</b> quit (60. 1 %). Factors associated with provider visits included being female, being 45 years or older, having health insurance, and being Vietnamese. Among smokers who saw a provider, factors associated with provider <b>advice</b> <b>to</b> quit included having health insurance and being a daily smoker. Conclusions. Asian-American smokers reported low proportions of provider <b>advice</b> <b>to</b> quit in the past year, largely because only half of smokers saw a provider. Providers who see such smokers may need greater awareness that several effective cessation treatments do not require health insurance, and that intermittent smokers need <b>advice</b> <b>to</b> quit...|$|R
