25|$|Another {{disadvantage}} of some superchargers is lower <b>adiabatic</b> <b>efficiency</b> {{when compared with}} turbochargers (especially Roots-type superchargers). <b>Adiabatic</b> <b>efficiency</b> {{is a measure of}} a compressor's ability to compress air without adding excess heat to that air. Even under ideal conditions, the compression process always results in elevated output temperature; however, more efficient compressors produce less excess heat. Roots superchargers impart significantly more heat to the air than turbochargers. Thus, for a given volume and pressure of air, the turbocharged air is cooler, and as a result denser, containing more oxygen molecules, and therefore more potential power than the supercharged air. In practical application the disparity between the two can be dramatic, with turbochargers often producing 15% to 30% more power based solely on the differences in <b>adiabatic</b> <b>efficiency</b> (however, due to heat transfer from the hot exhaust, considerable heating does occur).|$|E

40|$|Many {{recent studies}} suggest that {{supercritical}} Organic Rankine Cycles (ORCs), i. e., ORCs in which heat is supplied at a pressure greater than the liquid/vaport critical point pressure, have a great potential for low-temperature heat recovery applications, since they allow better recovery efficiency for a simplified cycle architecture. In this work we investigate supercritical flows of dense gases through axial, multi-stage, ORC turbines, using a numerical code including advanced equations of state and a high-order discretization scheme. At this stage, we focus on inviscid flow effects due to the peculiar thermodynamic behavior of the working fluids. Bidimensional numerical simulations are carried out, initially for a single stage and then for the complete turbine, for three working fluids: the refrigerants R 134 a and R 245 fa and carbon dioxide (CO 2). For the last one, the turbine is simulated for both inlet and outlet supercritical conditions. For R 134 a and R 245 fa, both supercritical and subcritical inlet turbine conditions are considered, the outlet pressure being always subcritical. Numerical simulations are {{used to evaluate the}} turbine <b>adiabatic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> found in the different cases, and an in-detail investigation of the flow field across the turbine is carried out to understand the main loss mechanisms. Shock-wave formation is found to have a crucial impact on the overall performance: carbon dioxide is shown to provide an optimal behavior since, because of the high values of the speed of sound in this fluid, the flow field is completely subsonic and no shock-waves are created. However, carbon dioxide requires to work at pressures of the order of 50 bars, which leads to higher installation costs. The use of R 134 a ensures satisfactory <b>adiabatic</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> despite the presence of weak shocks at the suction sides of rotor blades, whereas R 245 fa develops, for the turbine configuration considered in this work, strong shocks leading to significant losses.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 47 - 49). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This thesis presents the numerical simulation of flow in centrifugal compressors. A three-dimensional Navier-Stokes solver was employed to simulate flow through two centrifugal compressors. The first compressor simulated was the NASA low speed centrifugal compressor (LSCC). The LSCC was selected as a test compressor because of the experimental data available. The numerically simulated data was compared to the experimental data to validate the flow solver. The numerical results were in good agreement with the experimental. The second compressor simulated was a Honeywell turbopump centrifugal compressor (HCC). The HCC was simulated for three tip clearances at six wheel speeds. Six operating conditions were investigated at each tip clearance and wheel speed. The data obtained from the HCC simulations was used to investigate the effect of tip clearance on compressor performance. Specifically, the total-total pressure ratio, mass flow rate and <b>adiabatic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were tracked to see how each were affected by an increasing tip clearance. The results show that as the tip clearance was increased, the total-total pressure ratio, mass flow rate and <b>adiabatic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> all decreased for the same static-total pressure ratio. The pressure differences and temperature differences, from the pressure side to the suction side of the blade, and the vorticity were all explored as possible causes of this reduced performance. The pressure proved to be the biggest impactor on performance. The increased tip clearance let more flow leak across the blade tip. The leakage flow tried to homogenize the pressure difference across the blade. The overall effect resulted in a much lower pressure difference. The temperature remained nearly the same as the tip clearance increased. The vorticity increased, but this was also a result of the increased tip leakage flow. To aid in total-total pressure ratio predictions, the results for the HCC were put into compressor maps...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{approach}} to implementing a gas Ericsson cycle heat pump was developed. The concept, termed a liquid flooded Ericsson cooler (LFEC), uses liquid flooding of the compressor and expander to approach isothermal compression and expansion processes. Since the LFEC cycle {{has not been}} studied previously {{most of the work}} presented represents new contributions to the literature. The specific major contributions of the work can be summarized as follows. ^ Analytical models of liquid flooded compression and expansion processes were developed, using ideal gas, constant specific heat, and incompressible liquid assumptions. Special considerations for fixed volume ratio positive displacement compressors are detailed. The unique behavior of a liquid flooded compressor was explored, including the discovery of an optimum liquid flooding rate that minimizes compression power. ^ A computer model of the LFEC cycle was developed using ideal gas, incompressible liquid, and constant specific heat assumptions. The model was used for a thorough parameterc study.

It was believed to be the only system of its type in existence at the time of construction. Cooling capacities of up to 677 W were measured. Several factors related to the early state of development for the LFEC resulted in maximum second law efficiencies of only 3 %. ^ A second computer model of the LFEC was developed, which incorporated real fluid properties and additional parameters that were deemed necessary based on experimental observations. Two parametric studies were performed using this model.

To accomplish extra mileage changes, we have started to concentrate on expanding productivity in ranges where enhancements are significantly more troublesome and expensive to attain to - {{to a great extent}} on powertrain segments, for example, the transmission This stems from the way that transmissions work over a scope of force conditions, for example, low speed-high torque to fast low torque, and in addition through an assortment of apparatus proportions. To accomplish picks up here, we have tested the traditional speculation connected with powertrain capacities and plans. Ordinary powertrain arrangements comprise of an inner burning motor working over an extensive variety of torque and pace conditions and a transmission that has, by examination, just a couple of discrete apparatus proportions. The operational rationality of customary powertrains makes it hard to achieve most extreme motor fuel proficiency {{on the grounds that the}} open doors for working at the least fuel utilization or best "brake particular fuel utilization" are confined and by and large don't concur with the torque and rate conditions forced on the motor by the vehicle. Utilizing a CVT-arranged powertrain, the motor works at greatest burden conditions. This permits the motor to work at or close to its best brake particular fuel utilization rate, which implies that the motor is working at its most elevated normal <b>adiabatic</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> For inner ignition motors this would be 36 %, while for diesel motors it is 45 %. This task report assesses the flow condition of CVTs and upcoming innovative work, set in the connection of past improvement and issues customarily connected with it. The basic speculations and components are likewise talked about...|$|R
