The transfer factors of lanthanides from the soil to the tree leaves of the Atlantic Forest, Brazil, were calculated for one fern species (Alsophila sternbergii-Pteridophyta division) and four magnoliophytes species (Bathysa australis, Euterpe edulis, Garcinia gardneriana and Guapira opposita-Magnoliophyta division) obtained in two areas of Serra do Mar State Park and collected in two different seasons. Samples were analyzed by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). The soil-to-plant transfer factor (TF = C(plant) :C(soil)) in magnoliophytes species was correlated to the mass fraction of lanthanides in the soil, described by a exponential model (TF = <b>a.</b> <b>C</b> (<b>soil)</b> (-b)). Despite the tree fern Alsophila sternbergii presented a hyperaccumulation of lanthanides, this species did not have a significant relationship between TF and mass fraction in soil. Results indicated that plants of Magnoliophyta division selected the input of lanthanides from the soil, while the same was not observed in Alsophila sternbergii.

Traditional methods for quantifying <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> changes are limited due to: (1) their inability to detect small changes in C stocks given their insensitivity; and (2) the inherent spatial variability associated with soils. Alternative methods are required to quantify <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> changes in soil-plant systems. The 13 C natural abundance method is {{based on the premise that}} during CO 2 fixation, plants discriminate between C isotopes (13 C and 12 C), and thus contain a smaller proportion of 13 C (? 13 C - 26 ‰) compared to atmospheric CO 2 (? 13 C - 7 ‰). Furthermore, different plant species (C 3 and C 4) discriminate between C isotopes differently, which is reflected in the isotopic composition of SOM. This provides an ‘in-situ’ method by which to calculate the relative contribution of new C in soil-plant systems where the 13 C signal of the C input is different to the native SOM. We used this method to quantify differences in below-ground C inputs in four different land use types: forest, grassland, apple orchard, and vineyard.

Based on daily climate data, annual yield data and a soil database, we calculate the topsoil C dynamics for Swedish {{agricultural land}} 1990 - 2004, using <b>a</b> <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> balance model, ICBM. Losses from high <b>C</b> (organic) <b>soils</b> are calculated from subsidence, {{which in turn}} is calculated from soil properties, cropping system and weather conditions. We also present scenarios and projections into the future. Mineral soils are close to balance in all of the eight agricultural regions investigated. Average <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> mass roughly increases from South to North, since the lower yields and thus C inputs in Northern regions are more than balanced by the higher decomposition rates due to warmer climate in the South.

However carbon traders need assurances that contract levels of C are being achieved. Thus, methods are needed to monitor and verify <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> changes over time and space to determine whether target levels of C storage are being met. Because direct measurement over the large areas needed to sequester contract amounts of <b>C</b> in <b>soil</b> is not practical, other approaches are necessary. An integrated approach is described in which an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is used to assimilate in situ soil carbon measurements into <b>a</b> stochastic <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> model to estimate <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> changes over time and space. The approach takes into account errors in in situ measurements and uncertainties in the model to estimate mean and variance of <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> for each land unit within a larger land area. The approach requires initial estimates of <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> over space along with uncertainties in these estimates. Model predictions are made to estimate <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> for the next year, in situ <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> measurements update these predictions using maximum likelihood methods, and the spatial pattern of <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> mean, variance, and covariance thus evolve over time. This approach {{can also be used}} to provide yearly estimates of the changes in <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> over multiple fields, the variance in those estimates, and aggregate soil carbon mean and variance values each year.

China's arable lands, accounting for 13 % of the world's total, {{play an important role}} in <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> sequestration, but their potential to enhance C sequestration has not yet been quantitatively assessed. The C sequestration by agricultural soils is affected by many environmental factors (such as climate and soil conditions), biological processes (crop C fixation, decomposition and transformation), and crop and soil management (e. g. tillage and manure application). Estimation of the C sequestration potential requires the quantification of the combined effects of these factors and processes. In this study, we used a coupled remote sensing- and process-based ecosystem model to estimate the potential for C sequestration in agricultural soils of China and evaluated the sustainability of <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> uptake under different soil management options. The results show that practicing no-tillage on 50 % of the arable lands and returning 50 % of the crop residue to soils would lead to <b>an</b> annual <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> sequestration of 32. 5 Tg C, which accounts for about 4 % of China's current annual <b>C</b> emission. <b>Soil</b> <b>C</b> sequestration with improved soil management is highly time-dependent; the effect lasted for only 20 - 80 years.

The belowground allocation of photosynthates is also an important factor for improving soil organic carbon content (Kaur et al. 2002). The result from the present study also demonstrates that maximum accumulation of soil organic carbon is in the surface layer and decreased with increase in soil depth. Gradual decline in the availability towards lower soil layers could be due to more accumulation and mineralization and reduced root biomass in deeper soil layers. The other reason may be cycling of nutrients and depositing them in surface soils (Shah et al. 2013).

40|$|Soils are {{a crucial}} {{component}} of the Earth system; they comprise {{a large portion of}} terrestrial carbon stocks, mediate the supply and demand of nutrients, and influence the overall response of terrestrial ecosystems to perturbations. In this paper, we develop a new soil biogeochemistry model for the Community Land Model, version 4 (CLM 4). The new model includes a vertical dimension to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools and transformations, a more realistic treatment of mineral N pools, flexible treatment of the dynamics of decomposing carbon, and <b>a</b> radiocarbon (14 <b>C)</b> tracer. We describe the model structure, compare it with site-level and global observations, and discuss the overall effect of the revised soil model on Community Land Model (CLM) carbon dynamics. Site-level comparisons to radiocarbon and bulk <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> observations support the idea that <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> turnover is reduced at depth beyond what is expected from environmental controls for temperature, moisture, and oxygen that are considered in the model. In better agreement with observations, the revised soil model predicts substantially more and older <b>soil</b> <b>C,</b> particularly at high latitudes, where it resolves <b>a</b> permafrost <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> pool. In addition, the 20 th century-C dynamics of the model are more realistic than those of the baseline model, with more terrestrial C uptake over the 20 th century due to reduced N downregulation and longer turnover times for decomposing C...|$|R
40|$|An {{unbiased}} partitioning of autotrophic and heterotrophic {{components of}} soil CO 2 efflux {{is important to}} estimate forest carbon budgets and soil carbon sequestration. The contribution of autotrophic sources to soil CO 2 efflux (FA) may be underestimated during the daytime {{as a result of}} internal transport of CO 2 produced by root respiration through the transpiration stream. Here, we tested the hypothesis that carbon isotope composition of soil CO 2 efflux (dFS) in a Eucalyptus plantation grown on <b>a</b> <b>C</b> 4 <b>soil</b> is enriched during the daytime, which will indicate a decrease in FA during the periods of high transpiration. Mean dFS of soil CO 2 efflux decreased to - 25. 7 parts per thousand during the night and increased to - 24. 7 parts per thousand between 11 : 00 and 15 : 00 h when the xylem sap flux density was at its maximum. Our results indicate a decrease in the contribution of root respiration to soil CO 2 efflux during the day that may be interpreted as a departure of root-produced CO 2 in the transpiration stream, leading to a 17 parts per thousand underestimation of autotrophic contribution to soil CO 2 efflux on a daily timescale...|$|R
40|$|Under {{elevated}} atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, <b>soil</b> carbon (<b>C)</b> inputs {{are typically}} enhanced, suggesting larger <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> sequestration potential. However, <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> losses also increase and progressive nitrogen (N) limitation to plant growth {{may reduce the}} CO 2 effect on <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> inputs with time. We compiled a data set from 131 manipulation experiments, and used meta-analysis to test the hypotheses that: (1) elevated atmospheric CO 2 stimulates <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> inputs more than C losses, resulting in increasing <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> stocks; and (2) that these responses are modulated by N. Our results confirm that elevated CO 2 induces <b>a</b> <b>C</b> allocation shift towards below-ground biomass compartments. However, the increased <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> inputs were offset by increased heterotrophic respiration (Rh), such that <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> content was not affected by elevated CO 2. Soil N concentration strongly interacted with CO 2 fumigation: the effect of elevated CO 2 on fine root biomass and -production and on microbial activity increased with increasing soil N concentration, while the effect on <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> content decreased with increasing soil N concentration. These results suggest that both plant growth and microbial activity responses to elevated CO 2 are modulated by N availability, {{and that it is}} essential to account for soil N concentration in C cycling analyses. 11 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{heavy metal}} {{pollution}} due to long-term sewage irrigation {{is a serious}} environmental problem in many irrigation areas in northern China. Quickly identifying its pollution status is an important basis for remediation. Visible-near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VNIRS) provides a useful tool. In a case study, 76 soil samples were collected and their reflectance spectra were used to estimate cadmium (Cd) concentration by partial least squares regression (PLSR) and back propagation neural network (BPNN). To reduce noise, six pre-treatments were compared, in which orthogonal signal correction (OSC) was first used in <b>soil</b> <b>Cd</b> estimation. Spectral analysis and geostatistics were combined to identify Cd pollution hotspots. Results showed that Cd was accumulated in topsoil at the study area.

40|$|Background [...] Biogeochemical {{investigations}} of As transport and uptake by vegetation are being conducted over a metamorphic and intrusive terrane of the Fortymile River watershed of eastern Alaska. The occurrence of As in eolian sub-arctic soils is examined, {{as well as}} its relative bioconcentration in willow and alder. This information is used by land managers to assess the importance of geogenic vs. anthropogenic metal sources of environmentally important trace elements in multi-use areas where mining, recreation, and ecosystem preservation are important land-use options (Wanty and others, 2000). Study sites were located on Paleozoic (?) metamorphosed plutonic (supracrustal) metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks (and associated marble units), and the younger (Jurassic) monzodioritic and tonalitic rocks (Day and others, 2000; Gamble and others, 2001). Samples of <b>A,</b> B, and <b>C</b> <b>soil</b> horizons (Cryaquepts/Cryochrepts), willow (Salix glauca) and alder (Alnus crispa) leaf and twig tissue, and feather moss (Hylocomium splendens) were collected at 36 sites within {{the lower part of the}} main-stem of the Fortymile River (~ 600 km 2 area; fig. 1).

40|$|Loss of {{biodiversity}} impacts ecosystem functions, such as carbon (<b>C)</b> cycling. <b>Soils</b> {{are the largest}} terrestrial C reservoir, containing more C globally than the biotic and atmospheric pools together. <b>As</b> such, <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> cycling, and the processes controlling it, {{has the potential to}} affect atmospheric CO 2 concentrations and subsequent climate change. Despite the growing evidence of links between plant diversity and <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> cycling, there is a dearth of information on whether similar relationships exist between <b>soil</b> biodiversity and <b>C</b> cycling. This knowledge gap occurs even though there has been increased recognition that soil communities display high levels of both taxonomic and functional diversity and are key drivers of fluxes of C between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we used meta-analysis and regression analysis to quantitatively assess how soil biodiversity affects <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> cycling pools and processes (i. e., <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> respiration, litter decomposition, and plant biomass). We compared the response of process variables to changes in diversity both within and across groups of soil organisms that differed in body size, a grouping that typically correlates with ecological function. When studies that manipulated both within- and across-body size group diversity were included in the meta-analysis, loss of diversity significantly reduced <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> respiration (− 27. 5 %) and plant tissue decomposition (− 18 %) but did not affect above- or belowground plant biomass. The loss of within-group diversity significantly reduced <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> respiration, while loss of across-group diversity did not. Decomposition was negatively affected both by loss of within-group and across-group diversity. Furthermore, loss of microbial diversity strongly reduced <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> respiration (− 41 %). In contrast, plant tissue decomposition was negatively affected by loss of soil faunal diversity but was unaffected by loss of microbial diversity. Taken together, our findings show that loss of soil biodiversity strongly impacts on <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> cycling processes, and highlight the importance of diversity across groups of organisms (e. g., primary consumers and secondary decomposers) for maintaining full functionality of C cycle processes. However, our understanding of the complex relationships between <b>soil</b> biodiversity and <b>C</b> cycling processes is currently limited by the sheer number of methodological concerns associated with these studies, which can greatly overestimate or underestimate the impact of soil biodiversity on <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> cycling, challenging extrapolation to natural field settings. Future studies should attempt to further elucidate the relative importance of taxonomic diversity (species numbers) versus functional diversity...|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{metabolism}} plays a {{key role}} in regulating the biogeochemical cycle of forest ecosystems, but the mechanisms driving microbial growth are not well understood. Here, we synthesized 689 measurements on soil microbial biomass carbon (C mic) and nitrogen (N mic) and related parameters from 207 independent studies published up to November 2014 across China's forest ecosystems. Our objectives were to (1) examine patterns in C mic, N mic, and microbial quotient (i. e., C mic / <b>C</b> <b>soil</b> and N mic / N soil rates) by climate zones and management regimes for these forests; and (2) identify the factors driving the variability in the C mic, N mic, and microbial quotient. There was a large variability in C mic (390. 2 mg kg − 1), N mic (60. 1 mg kg − 1, C mic : N mic ratio (8. 25), C mic / <b>C</b> <b>soil</b> rate (1. 92 %), and N mic / N soil rate (3. 43 %) across China's forests. The natural forests had significantly greater C mic (514. 1 mg kg − 1 vs. 281. 8 mg kg − 1) and N mic (82. 6 mg kg − 1 vs. 39. 0 mg kg − 1) than the planted forests, but had less C mic : N mic ratio (7. 3 vs. 9. 2) and C mic / <b>C</b> <b>soil</b> rate (1. 7 % vs. 2. 1 %). Soil resources and climate together explained 24. 4 – 40. 7 % of these variations. The C mic : N mic ratio declined slightly with <b>C</b> <b>soil</b> : N soil ratio, and changed with latitude, mean annual temperature and precipitation, suggesting a plasticity of microbial carbon-nitrogen stoichiometry. The C mic / <b>C</b> <b>soil</b> rate decreased with <b>C</b> <b>soil</b> : N soil ratio, whereas the N mic / N soil rate increased with <b>C</b> <b>soil</b> : N soil ratio; the former was influenced more by soil resources than by climate, whereas the latter was influenced more by climate. These results suggest that soil microbial assimilation of carbon and nitrogen are jointly driven by soil resources and climate, but may be regulated by different mechanisms...|$|R
30|$|One {{of the key}} {{aspects of}} {{studying}} ecosystem responses to either environmental changes (i.e., warming or changes in precipitation) or differences in land use (i.e., grazing regimes) is whether there are initial, transitory, and/or regime shifts to new stable states (Briske et al. 2006). We propose that the lightly grazed system has begun to reach <b>a</b> <b>C</b> cycling equilibrium as the <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> pools have not changed significantly since the <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> pool analysis of these pastures in 1993 (Schuman et al. 1999; Ingram et al. 2008). To the contrary, the ungrazed and the heavily grazed systems continue to show <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> loss (Ingram et al. 2008).

Funder: BBSRC RONO: BBS/E/W/ 10963 A 01 EGlobal <b>soil</b> carbon (<b>C)</b> stocks account for approximately three times that found in the atmosphere. In the Aso mountain region of Southern Japan, seminatural grasslands have been maintained by annual harvests and/or burning for more than 1000 years. Quantification of <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> stocks and C sequestration rates in Aso mountain ecosystem is needed to make well-informed, land-use decisions to maximize C sinks while minimizing <b>C</b> emissions. <b>Soil</b> cores were collected from six sites within 200 km 2 (767 ? 937 m asl.) from the surface down to the k-Ah layer established 7300 years ago by a volcanic eruption. The biological sources of the C stored in the Aso mountain ecosystem were investigated by combining <b>C</b> content at <b>a</b> number of sampling depths with age (using 14 C dating) and ? 13 C isotopic fractionation. Quantification of plant phytoliths at several depths was used to make basic reconstructions of past vegetation and was linked with C-sequestration rates. The mean total C stock of all six sites was 232 Mg C ha? 1 (28 ? 417 Mg C ha? 1), which equates to <b>a</b> <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> sequestration rate of 32 kg C ha? 1 yr? 1 over 7300 years. Mean <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> sequestration rates over 34, 50 and 100 years were estimated by <b>an</b> equation regressing <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> sequestration rate against <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> accumulation interval, which was modeled to be 618, 483 and 332 kg C ha? 1 yr? 1, respectively. Such data allows for a deeper understanding in how much C could be sequestered in Miscanthus grasslands at different time scales. In Aso, tribe Andropogoneae (especially Miscanthus and Schizoachyrium genera) and tribe Paniceae contributed between 64 % and 100 % of <b>soil</b> <b>C</b> based on ? 13 C abundance.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2006 Patterns of and {{controls}} over N₂ fixation by green alder (A. viridis) were studied in post-fire, mid-succession, and white spruce upland forests in interior Alaska during 1997 - 2000, {{focusing on the}} hypothesis that ecosystem-level nitrogen (N) inputs decrease with successional development. Across all stands, alder created islands of elevated soil N and carbon, depleted soil phosphorus (P), and more acidic soils, effects which translated to the stand-level in response to greater alder stem density. Rates of N₂ fixation (measured by acetylene reduction = ARA) closely tracked plant phenology during the 1997 (a drought year) and 1998 (a year of normal precipitation) growing seasons. During 1998, stands with higher maximum ARA had higher %N in the O, <b>A,</b> and <b>C</b> <b>soil</b> horizons. N₂-fixation rates were influenced by soil P, {{as evidenced by the}} findings that maximum ARA was positively correlated with foliar N:P ratios, and with subcanopy %P in the O and A soil horizons. During the drought year, alder leaf %P and leaf N resorption were lower and leaves were thinner when compared to 1998. Drought effects were most pronounced in mid-succession where alder exhibited reduced ARA (- 76 %), leaf %P (- 14 %), leaf thickness (- 40 %), and lower leaf resorption of P (- 66 %) and N (- 78 %). Although ARA and nodule biomass did not differ among stand types, increases in alder densities with successional time translated to increasing ecosystem-level N inputs across the chronosequence. These results contradict established theory predicting a decline in N₂-fixation rates and N₂-fixer abundance during successional stand development...|$|R

Three 13 C-depleted leaf litter (Liquidambar styraciflua L., Cercis canadensis L. and Pinus taeda L., δ 13 CvsPDB ≈ − 43 ‰), differing in their degradability, were incubated on <b>a</b> <b>C</b> 4 <b>soil</b> (δ 13 CvsPDB ≈ − 18 ‰) under laboratory-controlled conditions for 8  months. At harvest, compound-specific isotope analyses were performed on different classes of soil compounds [i. e. phospholipids fatty acids (PLFAs), n-alkanes and soil pyrolysis products]. Linoleic acid (PLFA 18 : 2 ω 6, 9) was found to be very depleted in 13 C (δ 13 CvsPDB ≈ from − 38 to − 42 ‰) compared to all other PLFAs (δ 13 CvsPDB ≈ from − 14 to − 35 ‰). Because of this, fungi were identified as the first among microbes to use the litter as source of C.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a probabilistic analysis at the ultimate limit state of a shallow strip footing resting on <b>a</b> (<b>c,</b> phi) <b>soil</b> {{and subjected to}} an inclined load. The system response considered in the analysis is the safety factor obtained using the strength-reduction technique. The deterministic model makes use of the kinematic approach of the limit analysis theory. The Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) methodology is employed for the probabilistic analysis. The soil shear strength parameters and the footing load components are considered as random variables. A reliability analysis and a global sensitivity analysis are performed. Also, a parametric study showing {{the effect of the}} different statistical characteristics of the random variables on the variability of the safety factor is presented and discussed. It is shown that the use of the safety factor (based on the strength-reduction technique) for the system response is of significant interest in the reliability analysis, since it takes into account the simultaneous effect of soil punching and footing sliding and it requires a unique reliability analysis for both failure modes. Furthermore, it allows the rigorous determination of the zones of predominance of soil punching and footing sliding in the interaction diagram for different cases of soil and/or loading uncertainties. Finally, it is shown that the loading configurations located in the zone of the footing sliding predominance exhibit a more significant variability in the safety factor compared to those located in the zone of the soil punching predominance...|$|R
