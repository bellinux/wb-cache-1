25|$|Not {{all silk}} is {{produced}} by Bombyx mori. There are several species of Saturniidae that also are farmed for their silk, such as the Ailanthus moth (Samia cynthia group of species), the Chinese oak silkmoth (<b>Antheraea</b> pernyi), the Assam silkmoth (<b>Antheraea</b> assamensis), and the Japanese silk moth (<b>Antheraea</b> yamamai).|$|E
25|$|Saturniid {{caterpillars}} {{are large}} (50 to 100mm {{in the final}} instar), stout, and cylindrical. Most have tubercules that are often also spiny or hairy. Many are cryptic in coloration, with countershading or disruptive coloration to reduce detection, but some are more colourful. Some have urticating bristles. A few species have been noted to produce clicking sounds with the larval mandibles when disturbed (e.g. Saturniini like Actias luna and the polyphemus moth, <b>Antheraea</b> polyphemus). The clicks may serve as aposematic warning signals to a regurgitation defense.|$|E
25|$|After {{they have}} molted four times, their bodies become {{slightly}} yellow {{and the skin}} becomes tighter. The larvae then prepare to enter the pupal phase of their lifecycle, and enclose themselves in a cocoon made up of raw silk produced by the salivary glands. The final molt from larva to pupa takes place within the cocoon, which provides a vital layer of protection during the vulnerable, almost motionless pupal state. Many other Lepidoptera produce cocoons, but only a few—the Bombycidae, in particular the Bombyx genus, and the Saturniidae, in particular the <b>Antheraea</b> genus—have been exploited for fabric production.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{species are}} of major {{commercial}} importance in tussah and wild silk production. These notably include the Chinese tussah moth (<b>Antheraea</b> pernyi), its hybridogenic descendant <b>Antheraea</b> × proylei, and the Ailanthus silkmoth (Samia cynthia). In 2015, Adarsh Gupta K of Nagaraju's research team at Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad, India discovered the complete sequence and the protein structure of Muga Silk Fibroin and published it in Nature (journal) Scientific Reports ...|$|E

2500|$|Most Saturniidae are {{harmless}} {{animals at}} least as adults, {{and in many cases}} at all stages of their lives. Thus, some of the more spectacular species [...] in particular <b>Antheraea</b> [...] can be raised by children or school classes as educational pets.

50|$|India {{produces}} four {{kinds of}} silk: mulberry, tasar, muga and eri. The silkworm Bombyx mori is fed on mulberry leaves cultivated in plantations. Silkworms {{are also found}} wild on forest trees, e.g <b>Antheraea</b> paphia which produces the tasar silk (Tussah). <b>Antheraea</b> paphia feeds on several trees such as Anogeissus latifolia, Terminalia tomentosa, T. arjuna (Terminalia arjuna), Lagerstroemia parviflora and Madhuca indica. Wild silkworm <b>Antheraea</b> assamensis produces muga silk, and another wild silkworm Philosamia synthia ricini (= Samia cynthia) produces eri silk. The estimated annual production of tasar silk is 130 tonnes. Production {{of other types of}} silk exceeds 10 000 tonnes (Gupta 1994).|$|E
50|$|In 1959, at the Indian Statistical Institute {{she turned}} her {{attention}} to the genetics of the giant silkworm <b>Antheraea</b> mylitta, raising them in captivity to test the quality of their silk. In January 1961 she and J.B.S.H., assisted by their associate Krishna Dronamraju, were hosts to United States National Science Fair biology winners Gary Botting (zoology) and Susan Brown (botany). Using a novel technique of pheromone transfer, Botting had cross-bred an <b>Antheraea</b> mylitta female with a Telea polyphemus male, with viable offspring. Botting and Spurway concluded that the polyphemus moth was misclassified and should be included under the genus <b>Antheraea.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Differentiating between sexes of {{this species}} is very easy. The most obvious {{difference}} is the plumose antennae. Males have very bushy antennae while females have moderately less bushy antennae. The male's antennae are used to detect pheromones released by unmated females. Another {{difference is that the}} females are slightly larger in the abdomen due to carrying eggs. A surprising amount of variation occurs within this species. Color patterns can range from a reddish-cinnamon to a dark brown, but are almost always a shade of brown.In the late 1950s, amateur lepidopterist Gary Botting hybridized the polyphemus moth (then known as Telea polyphemus) with <b>Antheraea</b> yamamai from Japan and, later, <b>Antheraea</b> mylitta from India by transferring the pheromone-producing scent sacs from female [...] "T. polyphemus" [...] to the <b>Antheraea</b> females and allowing T. polyphemus males to mate with them. The resultant hybrids were displayed in his winning U.S. National Science Fair exhibit [...] "Intergeneric hybridization among giant silk moths." [...] After Botting consulted with genetic statistician J.B.S. Haldane and his wife, entomologist Helen Spurway, the polyphemus moth was reclassified, becoming <b>Antheraea</b> polyphemus.|$|E
