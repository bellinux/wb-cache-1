40|$|Over {{the last}} years an {{increasing}} number of flip chip (FC) interconnection technologies have emerged. While flip chip assembly offers many advantages compared to conventional packaging techniques, several aspects prevent this technology from entering the high volume market. Among these are the availability of bumped chips and the costs for the substrates with matching coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) to the chip (i. e. AlN substrates) in order to maintain a high reliability. FC soldering of bumped chips on organic PWB and subsequent underfilling using a low viscosity, particle-filled epoxy material was shown to yield reliable interconnections. For this paper, electrolessly Ni-Au plated chips were mechanically bumped with PbSn 2 bumps using a semiautomatic wirebonder. They were subsequently soldered on an organic substrate (FR 4) with PbSn 60 bumped pads and underfilled. Another possibility is the use of chips with gold stud bumps, which are bonded to the FR 4 substrate by using a nonc onductive <b>adhesive</b> <b>foil.</b> During the bonding the bumps pierce through the foil and make the electrical contact while the adhesive supplies the mechanical stability. Moreover, the adhesive fills the gap between chip and substrate, relieving the bumps of the mechanical stress resulting from the different CTE's.

40|$|The {{immunoassay}} is {{an important}} serological detection method for biochemical active materials (antigens / anti-bodies). By designing appropriate micro fluidic structures to perform the classic process steps of an immunoassay it can be integrated on a microfluidic chip. The reagents are transported through a micro fluidic reaction chamber where they perform the biochemical reactions. These reagents are stored in the micro-fluidic channels on the chip. The suitability of <b>adhesive</b> <b>foils</b> as low priced and simple seals of the microfluid channels is shown by performing immunoassays in micro-fluid cuvette structures. Signal detection can be performed by fluorescence and by chemoluminescence with sufficient accuracy for, e. g. the diagnosis of a cardiac infarct. A micro pump with two dimensional valve structures without moving parts was developed for the liquid-handling on the micro-fluidic chip. This pump can be manufactured by photolithographic techniques for prototyping {{as well as by}} mass production processes, like hot embossing and injection moulding. Integration of this micro pump into fluidic chip structures manufactured from SU- 8 photoresist shows the suitability of this pump for the production of micro-fluid analysis systems.

The performance of the micro pump, and the reaction chamber were optimized by computer simulations. The channel crossing where the different reagents enter the reaction chamber was also improved by computational fluid dynamics (cfd).

40|$|Flip chip {{attachments}} {{provide the}} highest interconnect density possible, making this technology attractive {{for use with}} flexible high density substrates. This paper presents three flip chip adhesive process methods based on flexible polyimide and polyester substrates using gold, nickel/gold and gold stud bumps. Isotropic conductive adhesives are promising for adhesive joining, as they conduct electricity equally in all directions. To use such adhesives in flip chip applications, the material must be applied precisely to the points to be connected, and must be not allowed to flow and short circuit between circuit lines. Anisotropically conductive adhesive materials are prepared by dispersing conductive particles in an adhesive matrix at a concentration high enough to assure reliable conductivity between substrate and IC electrodes. Another possibility {{is the use of}} nonconductive adhesives and Au-bumped chips, which are bonded via thermocompression to the substrate.

40|$|Spontaneous {{failures}} in thermally toughened glass are frequently reported, although the actual percentage is quite small, suppliers in the Netherlands reporting {{one or two}} cases a year while thousands of tempered panels are supplied. These cases are rarely investigated in the Netherlands because the broken thermally toughened glass is usually not in one piece and can thus not be sent for analysis. In 2015 several sliding thermally toughened glass single curved vehicle roof windows failed within several months. A butterfly pattern was seen and NiS failure was suspected by the window manufacturer. As a coloured <b>adhesive</b> <b>foil</b> had been applied during manufacturing the glass shards were kept together. The broken glass was shipped back to the supplier and was together with several non-broken roof windows sent to Delft University of Technology for analysis. The compressive surface pre-stress in the intact roof panels was measured with a SCALP 5 device. It {{was found that the}} compressive surface pre-stress varied, as bands of low compressive surface pre-stress alternating with bands of high compressive surface pre-stress appeared in the specimens. Destructive testing of the intact windows showed that the windows failed in the bands of low compressive surface pre-stress. The actual bending strength was far below the strength thermally toughened glass should have. Microscopic analysis of the butterfly fragment of the “spontaneously” failed roof windows showed that the failure was not caused by any inclusion in the glass, but started at the surface of the glass and was probably due to overloading. It is concluded that the failures were not spontaneous but the result of overloading due to uneven tempering of the glass. Structural MechanicsStructural and Building Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Electrical {{discharge}} machining (EDM) is a non-conventional machining process where materials are removed by the thermal energy exerted from series of electrical sparks. This process is applied for machining of non-conductive alumina (Al 2 O 3). The workpiece {{is covered with}} the <b>adhesive</b> copper <b>foil</b> to initiate the initial spark between the workpiece and the tool electrode. A pyrolytic carbon (PyC) layer is generated on workpiece surface by dissociating kerosene dielectric after the machining of initial copper assisting electrode (AE) layer.

The {{results showed that the}} lowest and the highest values of peak current were 1. 1 A and 1. 3 A, respectively. Material cannot be removed due to insufficient PyC layer generation for any values of peak current less than 1. 1 A or more than 1. 3 A. From the results, it is also observed that the MRR is increased when higher peak current values are used. MRR was found to be 0. 052 mm 3 /min at peak current 1. 1 A and it was found to be 0. 132 mm 3 /min at peak current 1. 3 A...|$|R

Initial measurements are performed for the investigation of a single sting propeller. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is applied in order to study the vortex pattern behind the propeller. Now, several planes are measured with the intent to determine the forces on the propeller using a simplified momentum method approach. It is shown that this method depends severely on the inflow boundary conditions, making such a method impracticable for engineering estimations. Nevertheless is the investigation of the vorticity distribution considerably useful in the quantification of high loading events. Additional BOS measurements show that the propeller slipstream contraction can be determined which is useful for a validation of less advanced CFD codes. PIV is then applied to propeller flow features at high lift conditions. The slipstream of a propeller on a half-model is investigated for increasing angles of attack. The root vortices from the propeller blade are shown to introduce secondary vortices in the flow field distribution over the nacelle and the wing. A numerical calculation is available which allows addressing several aspects of the level of agreement between unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes calculations and phase-locked Particle Image Velocimetry measurements. Although in general the flow field distributions are comparable there are distinct differences in the vortical regions. In particular the secondary vortices caused by the root vortices are not visible in the boundary layer in the numerical computations. A comparison of the circulation strength of the tip vortices indicates that the numerical calculations suffer from significant numerical dissipation. During the analysis of the final PIV data is was found that the symmetric phase-only filter has a detrimental effect on the peak-locking. A more detailed analysis based on synthetic images shows that the phase-only filter performs badly in regions with varying particle diameter and fluctuation free flows. An artificial introduced fluctuation field shows that it overshadows the peak-locking. The symmetric phase-only was originally introduced for PIV measurements with significant reflections. It is suggested to use this filter only if it can be shown that no peak-locking is present in the data (e. g. on a sample of the free stream flow). The final PIV measurement is performed for the investigation at propeller thrust reverse. Thrust reverse is investigated for two cases. One setting has identical blade pitch angles and the second setting has alternating blade pitch angles. It is shown that the phase-locked flow fields at both cases differ significantly, although both settings deliver the same amount on negative thrust. The lesser amount of fluctuations in the second case is supported by hot-film measurements. The alternating blade pitch angles are thus a viable option for producing negative thrust on propellers. The outlook presents PIV measurements and CFD calculations on an ‘open rotor’ which indicate that there is future need for PIV measurements, in order to get an understanding of the flow field behavior {{as well as for the}} validation of numerical codes.

40|$|The thermally-induced {{stresses}} and deformations in graphite-epoxy tubes {{with aluminum foil}} bonded to both inner and outer surfaces, and to the outer surface only are computed. Tubes fabricated from three material systems, T 300 / 934, P 75 s/ 934, and P 75 s/BP 907, and having a 1 inch inner radius and a lamination sequence of (+ 15 / 0 + or - 10 / 0) sub s are studied. Radial, axial, and circumferential stresses in the various layers of the tube, in the foil, and in the <b>adhesive</b> bonding the <b>foil</b> to the tubes are computed using an elasticity solution. The {{results indicate that the}} coatings have no detrimental effect on the stress state in the tube, particularly those stresses that lead to microcracking. The addition of the aluminum foil does, however, significantly influence the axial expansion of the T 300 / 934 tube, the tube with the softer graphite fibers. The addition of foil can change the sign of the axial coefficient of thermal expansion. Twist tendencies of the tubes are only slightly affected by the addition of the coatings, but are of second order compared to the axial response...|$|R
40|$|In situ {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (isPCR) has been applied in many fields that require detection of a genomic marker in combination with its topographic localization in tissue. We describe here a novel approach that circumvents the major drawbacks of in situ PCR, ie, low sensitivity, leakage of DNA from cells, and inability to quantify the DNA input. Frozen sections of a lymph node from a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) - 1 -infected patient were fixed on glass microscope slides, and the glass was scored into square fragments of 0. 5 -mm edge length using a diamond cutting device. Slides were then attached to <b>adhesive,</b> elastic plastic <b>foil</b> and finally broken, and the foil was extended to allow sorting of fragments into PCR microtiter plates. The material was tested for HIV- 1 proviral DNA by a sensitive real-time PCR protocol. Subjacent sections were stained for follicular dendritic cells to identify follicles. The fragmentation process prevented leakage of amplified DNA to neighboring areas as often experienced with in situ PCR. Provirus was clearly associated with follicular areas, in which provirus-carrying cells represented an average of 0. 8 % of the total cell population (peak density, 3. 1 % of all follicular cells). The results of this method suggest that the high density of provirus-containing cells in follicles may be important for the persistence of proviral DNA in infected persons...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{management}} of electronic products {{relies on the}} effective dissipation of heat. This {{can be achieved by}} the optimisation of the system design with the help of simulation methods. The precision of these models relies also on the used material data. For the determination of this data an experimental set-up for a static measurement is presented, which evaluate thermal conductivity of thermal interface materials (e. g <b>adhesive,</b> solder, <b>foils,</b> or pastes). It is common practice for high power applications to assemble power devices as bare dies in chip on board technique or to use flip chip assemblies with a directly mounted copper or aluminium heatsink. The thermal resistance of the thermal interface material is the bottleneck of the thermal heat flow from the active device junction to the cooler. All the more important is the fact of strongly localised hot spots, as heat spreading requires better thermal interface materials as just heat-transfer. If possible, it is useful and common to reduce the thickness of the thermal interface material. But for thinner thermal interface materials the thermal interface resistance (between the silicon and the thermal interface material as well as between the thermal interface material and the cooler material) is no longer negligible. Therefore it is essential to account for this effect in the measurement set-up. Common measurement techniques place the thermal interface material between two copper plates, heating the plate above and cooling the plate below. In this set-up the heat flow through the thermal interface material is supposed to equal the electrical power loss. The thickness of the thermal interface material is some millimetres. This approach does not account for size effects and interface resistances occurring in real set-ups. Therefore a more accurate measurement set-up is constructed and presented. This set-up contains in situ measurement of applied force, the measurement is using interfaces as in real power assembly (same interface resistance) and is universal useable for application of all marketgoing thermal interface materials. A range of different interface materials is characterised with varying thickness. Thus the thermal conductivity of the materials and the interface resistance is characterised. It is shown that the interface material can become a key issue for the thermal {{management of}} dynamically loaded devices. On this example a model with statically determined material data is validated and discussed in simulation and experiment. The paper gives an overview over the set-up and the measurement technique and discusses experimental and simulation results...|$|R
40|$|The {{competitiveness}} of timber as structural material in large structures is often {{governed by the}} cost of structural joints. Tests indicate that the new joint concept presented herein using glued wood-to-steel plate joints can possibly reduce the cost by matching joint strength to member strength. The design is inspired by two previously proposed designs using a single large dowel and using a rubber <b>foil</b> interlayer in <b>adhesive</b> joints. Analytical 1 D and numerical 3 D models of the bond line are proposed {{in order to further}} develop the concept, both {{in the case of a}} traditional adhesive joint and for the innovative rubber <b>foil</b> <b>adhesive</b> joint. The glued wood-to-steel plate joints studied are lap joints with a load bearing capacity assumed to be governed by failure within or along the bond line. In the 1 D and 3 D structural models both linear elastic and non-linear fracture mechanics were applied, with the non-linear fracture mechanics model taking into account the gradual damage fracture softening in a fracture zone. For the conventional type of bond line it was found that bond line softening needs to be considered for adequate strength analysis while it was not needed for a bond line with a rubber foil. The computational results are compared to previous full scale test results. The numerical results show good agreement and the analytical results reasonable agreement. When using a high strength adhesive, the strength of the wood along the bond line is governing joint failure. For this case, the analyses predict a 150 % load bearing capacity increase by the introduction of a rubber foil as compared to a traditional design. The test results indicated an even higher increase...|$|R
