Many researchers said that the result of teaching and learning English is considered unsatisfactory. It proved by most the students who have graduated from senior high school still have less ability in English. They can not rely on their ability whenever it is required. We ought to consider the hindrance that cause this condition is dealing with the using of <b>audiovisual</b> <b>aids.</b> Many teachers of English hardly use <b>audiovisual</b> <b>aids</b> in teaching learning process.
