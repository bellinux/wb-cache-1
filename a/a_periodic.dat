40|$|Abstract:- Optimal multirate {{control of}} the {{networked}} control systems is investigated in this paper. Under p – to – wσ communication sequence that sensors access communication medium and m – to – wρ communication sequence that actuators access communication medium, the plant of networked control system acts as <b>a</b> linear <b>periodic</b> time-varying system. Using lifting technology, <b>a</b> linear <b>periodic</b> time-varying system is transformed into <b>a</b> linear <b>periodic</b> time-invariant system and the linear quadratic performance index of <b>a</b> linear <b>periodic</b> time-varying system is transformed into that of <b>a</b> linear <b>periodic</b> time-invariant system. Controllability and observability of transformed system are analyzed. An optimal state feedback control and an optimal output feedback control are given. The simulation {{results show that the}} optimal multirate control strategies proposed in this paper are feasible.

Galileo became an accomplished lutenist himself and would have learned early from his father a scepticism for established authority, the value of well-measured or quantified experimentation, an appreciation for <b>a</b> <b>periodic</b> or musical measure of time or rhythm, {{as well as the}} results expected from a combination of mathematics and experiment.|$|E

5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on 8May several satellite experts questioned the analysis of satellite pings made by Inmarsat staff because the Doppler frequency shifts measured were apparently not properly corrected against the satellite's own drift (<b>a</b> <b>periodic</b> North-South oscillation of 3° every 24hours). Without any additional data being released, the implication of this new analysis was that the northern portion of the Inmarsat satellite pings arc could not be ruled out.

The inflated atmosphere becomes less ionized and loses energy, causing it to cool and shrink back down again. The result of this cycle is <b>a</b> <b>periodic</b> pulsation of the atmosphere and a matching variation of the luminosity.|$|E
