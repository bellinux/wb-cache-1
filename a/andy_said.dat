5|$|Though Evans was the {{stronger}} {{of the two}} against the clock, Schleck had surpassed expectations in the long time trial at the 2010 Tour de France, leading to speculation as to whether his 57-second cushion over the Australian could be sufficient for him to win the Tour. Evans rode {{one of the best}} time trials of his career, finishing in second place seven seconds off the pace of Tony Martin, the rider who was crowned world time trial champion later that year. <b>Andy</b> <b>said</b> of his and his brother's rides that they were probably the best time trials likewise of their respective careers, but they were no match for Evans' performance. The Australian was two and a half minutes better than both of them, taking the overall lead by {{a minute and a half}} with Andy slipping to second and Fränk to third. Since the Tour's final stage is traditionally mostly ceremonial save for a final sprint finish, the time trial effectively cemented the final overall standings. Andy took the positive from the result, saying he and his brother were both proud of each other for their efforts and were excited to stand on the podium together in Paris, even if neither of them was on the top step.|$|E

Hundreds of people would come, and I’d be cutting someone's hair. Andy came.

[...] "I was famous for giving haircuts, so he said, [...] "Would you let me do a film of you doing haircuts?"

[...] I said, [...] "Oh, sure, let's do it." [...] So, I started doing it. I was a technician— I’d been a light designer for [...] the Judson Church. I also worked for some off-Broadway theater and avant-garde dance companies. I installed all the lighting at the Factory, all the sound systems." [...] In return for making over his loft, Warhol gave Name a new role within the Factory. [...] "I was into light and sound before, but not photography," [...] Name said. [...] "Andy had a still camera, but he had gotten the Bolex. He was going to start to do films, and he gave me the Pentax and said, [...] "Here, Billy, you do the still photography; I’m going to start making films." [...] I became the in-house photographer and was sort of like the foreman. Eventually I moved in." [...] Name and Warhol eventually became lovers, but the romantic aspect of their relationship slowly dissolved into mutual loyalty and admiration.|$|E

To dive down through hatchways, an' among broken bulkheads, to hunt fur any partiklar kind o' boxes under seven foot of sea-water, ain't no easy job.

If we could have pumped the water out of the hold we could have got at any part of the cargo we wanted, but as it was, we couldn't even reach the ship's stores, which, of course, must have been mostly sp'iled anyway, whereas the canned vittles was just as good as new.

5000|$|Gibb {{recorded}} {{an album}} of songs at Criteria around October 1976. He came to Miami in September and the sessions at Criteria {{are known to have}} coincided with the Eagles recording Hotel California, which they completed in October.

The sessions were produced by Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson, and with Barry on two songs, Galuten chose the experienced musicians who play on the album. The core group was Joey Murcia and Tim Renwick on guitar, Paul Harris and Galuten himself on piano and keyboards and Harold Cowart and Ron Ziegler on bass and drums. For some songs, they were joined by other top session players. Barry was very impressed with the polished sound of the session players. Barry was present to record only two songs ("I Just Want to Be Your Everything" [...] and [...] "(Love Is) Thicker Than Water") the two that he wrote for Andy, and although <b>Andy</b> <b>said</b> it Is (Thicker Than Water)" [...] was almost entirely Barry's work, it does sound a little closer to Andy's style.|$|E
