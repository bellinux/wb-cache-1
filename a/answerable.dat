5|$|After the Saur revolution, Taraki was {{appointed}} Chairman of the Presidium of the Revolutionary Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and retained his post as PDPA general secretary. Taraki initially formed a government {{which consisted of}} both Khalqists and Parchamites; Karmal became Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Council while Amin became Minister of Foreign Affairs and a Deputy Prime Minister, and Mohammad Aslam Watanjar became a Deputy Prime Minister. The two Parchamites Abdul Qadir and Mohammad Rafi became Minister of National Defence and Minister of Public Works respectively. According to Angel Rasanayagam, the appointment of Amin, Karmal and Watanjar as Deputy Prime Ministers led {{to the establishment of}} three cabinets; the Khalqists were <b>answerable</b> to Amin, the Parchamites were <b>answerable</b> to Karmal, and the military officers (who were Parchamites) were <b>answerable</b> to Watanjar. The first conflict between the Khalqists and Parchamites arose when the Khalqists wanted to give PDPA Central Committee membership to the military officers who participated in the Saur Revolution. Amin, who had previously opposed the appointment of military officers to the PDPA leadership, switched sides; he now supported their elevation. The PDPA Politburo voted in favour of giving membership to the military officers; the victors (the Khalqists) portrayed the Parchamites as opportunists, implying that the Parchamites had ridden the revolutionary wave, but not actually participated in the revolution. To make matters worse for the Parchamites, the term Parcham was, according to Taraki, a word synonymous with factionalism.|$|E
5|$|All {{of these}} {{positions}} were nominally {{appointed by the}} Emperor and their holders were <b>answerable</b> directly to him. Nevertheless, from 1936 the Japanese Army and Navy held, effectively, a legal right to nominate (or refuse to nominate) their respective ministers. Thus, they could prevent the formation of undesirable governments, or by resignation bring about the collapse of an existing government.|$|E
5|$|As at Darwin, Herring's primary {{difficulty}} was logistics. The {{troops on}} the Kokoda Track had to be supplied from Port Moresby either by air or by Papuan native carriers who lugged stores over the track on their backs. MacArthur created the Combined Operation Service Command (COSC), an unusual combined Australian-American logistical organisation, under U.S. Brigadier General Dwight Johns, who in turn was <b>answerable</b> to Herring. Herring backed a plan to take American engineers off working on the airstrips {{in order to develop}} the port by building a causeway to Tatana Island, the successful completion of which doubled the port's capacity and was the logistical turning point of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Colonel John M. Harman was {{the first}} post {{commander}} at Los Alamos. He joined the Santa Fe office as a lieutenant colonel on 19 January 1943, and was promoted to colonel on 15 February. Los Alamos officially became a military establishment on 1 April 1943, and he moved to Los Alamos on 19 April. He was succeeded by Lieutenant Colonel C. Whitney Ashbridge, {{a graduate of the}} Los Alamos Ranch School, in May 1943. In turn, Ashbridge was succeeded by Lieutenant Colonel Gerald R. Tyler in October 1944, Colonel Lyle E. Seaman in November 1945, and Colonel Herb C. Gee in September 1946. The post commander was <b>answerable</b> directly to Groves, and was responsible for the township, government property and the military personnel.|$|E
5|$|In 1776, the Sejm {{commissioned}} former chancellor Andrzej Zamoyski {{to draft}} a new legal code. By 1780, he and his collaborators had produced the Zamoyski Code (Zbiór praw sądowych). It would have strengthened royal power, made all officials <b>answerable</b> to the Sejm, placed the clergy and their finances under state supervision, and deprived landless szlachta of many of their legal immunities. The Code would also have improved the situation of non-noblestownspeople and peasants. Zamoyski's progressive legal code, containing elements of constitutional reform, met with opposition from native conservative szlachta and foreign powers; the 1780 Sejm did not adopt it.|$|E
5|$|In November 1941, Kesselring was {{appointed}} Commander-in-Chief South and {{was transferred to}} Italy along with his Luftflotte 2 staff, which {{for the time being}} also functioned as his Commander-in-Chief South staff. Only in January 1943 did he form his headquarters into a true theatre staff and create a separate staff to control Luftflotte 2. As a theatre commander, he was <b>answerable</b> directly to the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) and commanded ground, naval and air forces, but this was of little importance at first as most German units were under Italian operational control.|$|E
5|$|On 2 August 1914, the {{government}} activated the preliminary {{stage of the}} war plan, which included the establishment of censorship. McCay was recalled to duty as Deputy Chief Censor (Australia), <b>answerable</b> to the Chief Censor in London. McCay organised a headquarters in Melbourne, and established district offices in the other state capitals. Soon after {{the outbreak of the}} Great War on 4 August, Bridges, now a brigadier general, appointed McCay to command the 2nd Infantry Brigade of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). He was succeeded by Lieutenant Colonel W. H. Tunbridge on 10 August, who in turn was succeeded by Colonel Monash on 17 August.|$|E
5|$|On Beecham's {{return to}} England in 1944 the LPO welcomed him back, and in October they gave a concert {{together}} that drew superlatives from the critics. Over the next months Beecham and the orchestra gave further concerts with considerable success, but the LPO players, now their own employers, {{declined to give}} him the unfettered control that he had exercised in the 1930s. If he were to become chief conductor again it would be as a paid employee of the orchestra. Beecham, unwilling to be <b>answerable</b> to anybody, left the LPO and in 1946 founded a rival orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic (RPO).|$|E
5|$|Plans for the {{delivery}} of the weapons in combat {{were assigned to the}} Weapons Committee, which was chaired by Ramsey, and <b>answerable</b> to Captain William S. Parsons. Ramsey drew up tables of organization and equipment for the Project Alberta detachment that would accompany the USAAF's 509th Composite Group to Tinian. Ramsey briefed the 509th's commander, Lieutenant Colonel Paul W. Tibbets, {{on the nature of the}} mission when the latter assumed command of the 509th. Ramsey went to Tinian with the Project Alberta detachment as Parsons's scientific and technical deputy. He was involved in the assembly of the Fat Man bomb, and relayed Parsons's message indicating the success of the bombing of Hiroshima to Groves in Washington, DC.|$|E
5|$|Texas has a plural {{executive}} branch system limiting {{the power of}} the governor, which is a weak executive compared to some other states. Except for the Secretary of State, voters elect executive officers independently; thus candidates are directly <b>answerable</b> to the public, not the governor. This election system has led to some {{executive branch}}es split between parties and reduced the ability of the governor to carry out a program. When Republican President George W. Bush served as Texas's governor, the state had a Democratic lieutenant governor, Bob Bullock. The executive branch positions consist of the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Comptroller of Public Accounts, Land Commissioner, Attorney General, Agriculture Commissioner, the three-member Texas Railroad Commission, the State Board of Education, and the Secretary of State.|$|E
5|$|The Gestapo's {{transfer}} to Himmler was {{a prelude to}} the Night of the Long Knives, in {{which most of the}} SA leadership were arrested and subsequently executed. The SS and Gestapo carried out most of the killings. On 20 July 1934, Hitler detached the SS from the SA, which was no longer an influential force after the purge. The SS became an independent elite corps of the NSDAP, <b>answerable</b> only to Hitler. Himmler's title of Reichsführer-SS now became his actual rank, equivalent to the rank of field marshal in the army (his previous rank was Obergruppenführer). As Himmler's position and authority grew, so did his de facto rank.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{decided on}} 21 June that Röhm and the SA {{leadership}} {{had to be}} eliminated. He sent Göring to Berlin on 29 June, to meet with Himmler and Heydrich to plan the action. Hitler took charge in Munich, where Röhm was arrested; he gave Röhm the choice to commit suicide or be shot. When Röhm refused to kill himself, he was shot dead by two SS officers. Between 85 and 200 members of the SA leadership and other political adversaries, including Gregor Strasser, were killed between 30 June and 2 July 1934 in these actions, known as the Night of the Long Knives. With the SA thus neutralised, the SS became an independent organisation <b>answerable</b> only to Hitler on 20 July 1934. Himmler's title of Reichsführer-SS became the highest formal SS rank, equivalent to a field marshal in the army. The SA was converted into a sports and training organisation.|$|E
5|$|In September 1942, the {{director}} of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), Vannevar Bush, suggested Styer be appointed director of the Manhattan Project, but Somervell did not wish to lose his services, and engineered the appointment of Groves instead. On 23 September 1942, Styer {{became a member of the}} Military Policy Committee, a group chaired by Bush (with James B. Conant as his alternate) with Rear Admiral William R. Purnell as its third member. As director, Groves was <b>answerable</b> to the Military Policy Committee, which was responsible for the higher direction of the Manhattan Project. When the Combined Policy Committee was formed in September 1943 by the Quebec Agreement, its chairman, Secretary of War Henry Stimson, had Styer appointed as his deputy. Styer also became chairman of its technical subcommittee, which included America's Richard Tolman, Britain's James Chadwick and Canada's C. J. Mackenzie. The technical subcommittee became very influential, as it furnished most of the data on which the Combined Policy Committee based its decisions.|$|E
5|$|On 10 August 1917, Downes became Deputy Director of Medical Services (DDMS) of the Desert Mounted Corps, {{while still}} {{retaining}} {{the post of}} ADMS AIF Egypt. He was therefore <b>answerable</b> to three superiors—to Lieutenant General Harry Chauvel, {{the commander of the}} Desert Mounted Corps and AIF Egypt; to Major General Neville Howse, the DMS AIF in London; and to the new British DMS EEF, Major General William Travers Swan. As the EEF advanced into Palestine, the major medical problem remained transportation. During the operations in the Es Salt area, Downes experimented with the delivery of drugs and medical supplies by air. In the Jordan valley in 1918, however, Downes was confronted with an epidemic of malaria and vigorous preventative and prophylactic efforts were required in order to bring it under control.|$|E
5|$|On 4 January 1943, Kinkaid became Commander of the North Pacific Force (COMNORPACFOR) {{following}} {{the failure of}} his predecessor, Rear Admiral Robert A. Theobald, to work harmoniously with the U.S. Army. Command relationships in the North Pacific were complicated. Naval forces came under Fletcher's Northwestern Sea Frontier. The troops in Alaska, including Brigadier General William O. Butler's Eleventh Air Force, were commanded by Major General Simon B. Buckner, Jr., who was <b>answerable</b> {{to the head of}} the Western Defense Command, Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt. Kinkaid's command was responsible for coordinating these forces and retaking the Aleutian Islands captured by the Japanese. He found the Army eager to cooperate, but encountered more difficulty with Rear Admiral Francis W. Rockwell, the commander of the Amphibious Force, Pacific Fleet, and later the IX Amphibious Force. Rockwell was an Academy classmate of Kinkaid's, who was senior to him in rank, and convinced that he would both plan and command the amphibious phase of the operation rather than Kinkaid.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for the {{development}} of atomic bombs lay outside the realm of the Ministry of Defence. One reason for this was that it was only created in October 1946, by which time Portal had already been appointed as CPAE. Tizard became the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence in November 1946, and in January 1947 he also became the chairman of the Defence Research Policy Committee (DRPC), which was established to advise the Minister of Defence and the Chiefs of Staff on matters of scientific policy. Tizard attempted to gain some control over nuclear weapons policy. Anderson's advisory committee was abolished at the end of 1947, and two new committees were established in its place, the Atomic Energy (Defence Research) Committee AE(DR), which came under the DRPC, and was chaired by Tizard; and the Atomic Energy (Review of Production) Committee, which was <b>answerable</b> to Portal. But Tizard failed to gain control of atomic energy policy.|$|E
5|$|Rowell was {{promoted}} to colonel on 13 October 1939, and when the government decided to form I Corps in April 1940, Blamey was given the command and Rowell became brigadier, general staff (BGS), with the rank of brigadier. Blamey and Rowell prepared I Corps for operations as best they could, completing the force's structure and integrating new units as they arrived in the Middle East. Rowell strove to establish {{good relations with the}} British Army, while occasionally having to remind them that the AIF was <b>answerable</b> to its own commander in chief and its own government. Rowell's efforts to create an administrative headquarters to free the I Corps staff for operational duties foundered on Blamey's reluctance to delegate authority. The best that he could achieve was the creation of a Base and Line of Communications Units command under Brigadier Allan Boase but I Corps remained responsible for organisation and training.|$|E
5|$|The {{tests were}} {{authorized}} by President Harry S. Truman on 27 June 1947. The Atomic Energy Commission's Director of Military Applications, Brigadier General James McCormack and his deputy, Captain James S. Russell, met with Bradbury and John Manley at Los Alamos on 9 July {{to make arrangements}} for the tests. They readily agreed {{that they would be}} scientific in nature, with Los Alamos supplying the technical direction and the armed forces providing supplies and logistical support. The cost of the tests, around $20 million, was divided between the Department of Defense and the Atomic Energy Commission. Lieutenant General John E. Hull was designated as test commander. Rear Admiral William S. Parsons and Major General William E. Kepner reprised their Operation Crossroads roles as deputy commanders. Joint Task Force 7 was formally activated on 18 October 1947. As its commander, Hull was <b>answerable</b> to both the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Atomic Energy Commission.|$|E
5|$|As {{director}} of the Los Alamos Laboratory, Oppenheimer was no longer <b>answerable</b> to Compton, but reported directly to Groves. He {{was responsible for the}} technical and scientific aspects of Project Y. He assembled the nucleus of his staff from the groups that had been working for him on neutron calculations. These included his secretary, Priscilla Greene, Serber and McMillan from his own group, and Emilio Segrè and Joseph W. Kennedy's groups from the University of California, J. H. Williams' group from the University of Minnesota, Joe McKibben's group from the University of Wisconsin, Felix Bloch's group from Stanford University and Marshall Holloway's from Purdue University. He also secured the services of Hans Bethe and Robert Bacher from the Radiation Laboratory at MIT, Edward Teller, Robert F. Christy, Darol K. Froman, Alvin C. Graves and John H. Manley and his group from the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory, and Robert R. Wilson and his group, which included Richard Feynman, that had been performing Manhattan Project research at Princeton University. They brought with them a great deal of valuable scientific equipment. Wilson's group dismantled the cyclotron at Harvard University and had it shipped to Los Alamos; McKibben's brought two Van de Graaff generators from Wisconsin; and Manley's brought the Cockcroft–Walton accelerator from the University of Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{soon became}} {{dissatisfied}} with the dilatory way the project was run, with its indecisiveness over the selection of sites for the pilot plants. He was particularly disturbed at the allocation of an AA-3 priority, which would delay completion of the pilot plants by three months. Bush complained about these problems to Bundy and Under Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson. Major General Brehon B. Somervell, {{the commander of the}} army's Services of Supply, appointed Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves as project director in September. Within days of taking over, Groves approved the proposed site at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and obtained a AAA priority. At a meeting in Stimson's office on September 23 attended by Bundy, Bush, Conant, Groves, Marshall Somervell and Stimson, Bush put forward his proposal for steering the project by a small committee <b>answerable</b> to the Top Policy Group. The meeting agreed with Bush, and created a Military Policy Committee chaired by him, with Somervell's chief of staff, Brigadier General Wilhelm D. Styer, representing the army, and Rear Admiral William R. Purnell representing the navy.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Northcott as Chief of the General Staff and Blamey as Commander-in-Chief bore some similarities {{to the one}} between the RAAF's Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, and Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, {{the commander of the}} RAAF forces in the field, but Blamey was senior to Northcott, both in rank and in the Army's command structure. The relationship could still have been a delicate one, but in the event it was characterised by none of the rancour and rivalry that marred the wartime administration of the RAAF. In late 1943, Blamey sought to appoint Northcott as his deputy, but the government turned down his request, on the advice of General Douglas MacArthur, who did not want another officer who was <b>answerable</b> both to himself and the Australian Government. However, when Blamey travelled to Washington, D.C. and London in April 1944, he arranged for Northcott to act as Commander-in-Chief in his absence. After Wynter's death in February 1945, the post of LGA was abolished and the CGS again became responsible for administration.|$|E
5|$|The museum's Director-General is <b>answerable</b> to the {{trustees}} and acts as accounting officer. Since 1917 {{the museum has}} had six directors. The first was Sir Martin Conway, a noted art historian, mountaineer and explorer. He was knighted in 1895 for his efforts to map the Karakoram mountain range of the Himalayas, and was Slade Professor of Fine Arts at the University of Cambridge from 1901 to 1904. Conway held the post of Director {{until his death in}} 1937, when he was succeeded by Leslie Bradley. Bradley had served in the First World War in the Middlesex Regiment before being invalided out in 1917. He later became acquainted with Charles ffoulkes, who invited him to join the museum where he was initially engaged in assembling the museum's poster collection. Bradley retired in 1960 and was succeeded by Dr Noble Frankland. Frankland had served as a navigator in RAF Bomber Command, winning a Distinguished Flying Cross. While a Cabinet Office official historian he co-authored a controversial official history of the RAF strategic air campaign against Germany. Frankland retired in 1982 and was succeeded by Dr Alan Borg who had previously been at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts. In 1995 Borg moved to the Victoria and Albert Museum and was succeeded by Sir Robert Crawford, who had originally been recruited by Frankland as a research assistant in 1968. Upon Crawford's retirement in 2008 he was succeeded by Diane Lees, previously Director of the V Museum of Childhood. She was noted in the media as the first woman appointed to lead a British national museum.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the context}} of Spinoza's {{philosophical}} system, the PSR can be understood to unify causation and explanation. What {{this means is that}} for Spinoza, questions regarding the reason why a given phenomenon {{is the way it is}} (or exists) are always <b>answerable,</b> and are always <b>answerable</b> in terms of the relevant cause(s). This constitutes a rejection of teleological, or final causation, except possibly in a more restricted sense for human beings. Given this, Spinoza's views regarding causality and modality begin to make much more sense.|$|E
25|$|The Executive is the party’s {{administrative}} body, {{responsible for}} the day to day overall administration of the party, instructed by and <b>answerable</b> to the membership, provinces and Conference.|$|E
25|$|The Gauleiter was {{directly}} appointed by Hitler and only <b>answerable</b> to him. In practice, Hitler interfered {{little in the}} affairs of the local leaders and their power was almost absolute.|$|E
25|$|Universal {{jurisdiction}} may be asserted by {{a particular}} nation {{as well as by}} an international tribunal. The result is the same: individuals become <b>answerable</b> for crimes defined and prosecuted regardless of where they live, or where the conduct occurred; crimes said to be so grievous as to be universally condemned.|$|E
25|$|Until 1867 the Straits Settlements were <b>answerable</b> to the British {{administrator}} of the East India Company in Calcutta. The Settlements' administrators were dissatisfied with the way Calcutta was handling their affairs and they complained to London. The Company even tried to annul Singapore's free port status in 1856.|$|E
25|$|The Ogun River {{leading to}} Abeokuta was not safe for canoe traffic, with {{travelers}} {{at risk from}} Egba robbers. For this reason, on 14 November 1862 Freeman called on all British subjects to return from Abeokuta to Lagos, leaving their property, for which the chiefs of Abeokuta would be <b>answerable</b> to the British government.|$|E

25|$|Gillani retaliated by sacking Defence Secretary Lieutenant General (retired) Khalid Naeem Lodhi, a confidant {{of chief}} of army staff General Pervez Kiani. He reiterated that the Defence Secretary was removed in {{accordance}} with the law as he had made a mistake by not following the government's rules. He maintained that he was only <b>answerable</b> to the Parliament.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, {{the police}} {{discovered}} an arms cache and radio equipment at a mountain cabin and arrested Hans Otto Meyer, a businessman {{accused of being}} involved in selling illegal alcohol. Meyer claimed that the weapons were supplied by Norwegian intelligence. Rolf Hansen, defence minister at that time, stated the network was not in any way <b>answerable</b> to NATO and had no CIA connection.|$|E
25|$|On 26 June, the Honduran Supreme Court {{unanimously}} {{found that}} the Presidency had not complied with 16 June court order.

It appointed Supreme Court Justice Tomás Arita Valle to try the case.|$|E
