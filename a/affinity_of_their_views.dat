In chemical solutions, self-assembly is {{an outcome of}} random motion of molecules and the <b>affinity</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> binding sites for one another. In the area of nanotechnology, developing a simple, efficient method to organize molecules and molecular clusters into precise, pre-determined structure is crucial.|$|R

Two cell populations were obtained consisting, almost exclusively, of spheru- lous coelomocytes. Three types of sperulocytes (Types I to III) were identified. They differ from each other by structure and stain <b>affinities</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> spherules, and by some slight differences in density. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Recent work has shown that, despite the low <b>affinity</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> Ca 2 + transporters, Ca 2 + uptake into mitochondria always follows the stimulation of cells with agonists causing an increase of cytoplasmic Ca 2 + concentration. This process can modulate cellular events as diverse as aerobic metabolism, cytoplasmic diffusion of Ca 2 + signals and induction of apoptotic cell death...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFibrillins form {{multifunctional}} microfibrils in most connective tissues. Deficiencies in fibrillin assembly {{can result}} in fibrillinopathies, such as Marfan syndrome. We demonstrate the presence of heparin/heparan sulfate binding sites in fibrillin- 2 and - 3. Multimerization of all three fibrillins drastically increased the apparent <b>affinity</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> interaction with heparin/heparan sulfate. Surprisingly, contrary to other reports heparin/heparan sulfate strongly inhibited homo- and heterotypic N-to-C-terminal fibrillin interactions. These data suggest that heparin/heparan sulfate controls the formation of microfibrils at the bead interaction stage...|$|R
