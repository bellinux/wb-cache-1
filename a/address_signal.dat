Users can {{make use of the}} new [...] "Network and Sharing Center" [...] to see the status of their network connections, and to access every aspect of configuration. A single icon in the notification area (system tray) represents connectivity through all network adapters, whether wired or wireless. The network can be browsed using Network Explorer, which replaces Windows XP's [...] "My Network Places". Network Explorer items can be a shared device such as a scanner, or a file share. The Network Location Awareness (NLA) service uniquely identifies each network and exposes the network's attributes and connectivity type so that applications can determine the optimal network configuration. However, applications have to use the NLA APIs explicitly {{to be aware of the}} network connectivity changes, and adapt accordingly. Windows Vista uses the Link Layer Topology Discovery (LLTD) protocol to graphically present how different devices are connected over a network, as a Network Map. In addition, the Network Map uses LLTD to determine connectivity information and media type (wired or wireless), so that the map is topologically accurate. The ability to know network topology is important for diagnosing and solving networking problems, and for streaming content over a network connection. Any device can implement LLTD to appear on the Network Map with an icon representing the device, allowing users one-click access to the device's {{user interface}}.

Messenger RNA prepared from the free polysomes of T 3 -treated rats directed the in vitro synthesis of a polypeptide which only differed in amino acid sequence from mature cytochrome c in that it contained an NH 2 -terminal methionine. The in vitro product was incorporated specifically into purified rat liver mitochondria and became inaccessible to added trypsin when the mitochondria were added after translation was completed. Horse heart apocytochrome c, but not the holocytochrome, could compete with the in vitro synthesized polypeptide for its uptake into mitochondria. This suggests that the primary structural features of apocytochrome c, which serve as an <b>addressing</b> <b>signal</b> for mitochondria, are masked after the acquisition of heme and that this process occurs in the mitochondria. The <b>addressing</b> <b>signal</b> seems to be contained in a specific segment of the cytochrome polypeptide because only one fragment generated by CNBr cleavage of horse apocytochrome c, extending from residue 66 to the carboxy end of the molecule, could compete with the in vitro product for its transfer into mitochondria...|$|R
