5|$|Risley's survey {{task was}} aided when {{research}} papers of a recently deceased Indian Medical Service doctor, James Wise, {{were given to}} him by the doctor's widow. Wise had researched the people of Eastern Bengal and it was agreed that, after ascertaining the accuracy of his work, his research should be incorporated into Risley's survey results. In return, those volumes of the survey dealing with ethnographic matters would be dedicated to Wise. Further assistance came from the research of Edward Tuite Dalton into the jungle tribes of Chhotanagpur and Assam. Dalton, like Wise, had previously published his efforts but now they would be integrated {{as a part of a}} larger whole. Risley was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with the remaining areas of Bengal by making use of a large staff of correspondents who came from disparate backgrounds, such as missionaries, native people and Government officials.|$|E
5|$|The Comanches {{were the}} {{dominant}} group in the Southwest from the 1750s to the 1830s, and the domain they ruled was an empire known as Comancher√≠a. Confronted with Spanish, Mexican, and American outposts on their periphery in New Mexico, Texas, and Coahuila and Nueva Vizcaya in northern Mexico, they worked to increase their own safety, prosperity and power. Their empire collapsed after the Spanish era as their villages were repeatedly decimated by epidemics of smallpox and cholera in the late 1840s; the population plunged from 20,000 {{to just a few}} thousand by the 1870s. The Comanches were no longer <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with the U.S. Army, which took over control of the region after the Mexican American War ended in 1848.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} The Quatermass Xperiment came at an opportune time for Hammer. By 1955 {{the deal with}} Robert L. Lippert had expired and the company {{produced}} just one feature film that year, Women Without Men. Many of the independent cinemas that provided the market for Hammer's films in the UK were struggling {{in the face of}} competition from television and faced closure. The Quatermass Xperiment gave Hammer a much needed box office hit and was also the first film to bring the company to the attention of a major film distributor, in this case United Artists. From this point onward, Hammer was increasingly <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> directly with the major distributors and no longer needed intermediaries like Lippert. This ultimately spelt the end for Exclusive Films, Hammer's own distribution company, which was wound down in the late 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Zahir {{encouraged}} local Christian {{settlement in}} Acre, {{in order to}} contribute to the city's commercial dynamism in trade and manufacturing. Christians grew to become the largest religious group in the city by the late 18th century. Zahir's territory became a haven for Melkite and Greek Orthodox Christians from other parts of Ottoman Syria who migrated there for better trade and employment opportunities. In Nazareth, the Christian community prospered and grew under Zahir's rule, and saw an influx from the Maronite and Greek Orthodox communities of Lebanon and Transjordan, respectively. The Melkite patriarch lived in Acre between 1765 and 1768. Along with the Jews, the Christians contributed to the economy of Zahir's sheikhdom in a number of ways, including the relative ease with which they were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with European merchants, the networks of support many of them maintained in Damascus or Istanbul, and their role in service industries.|$|E
5|$|All {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} exposed to compounds that they cannot use as foods {{and would be}} harmful if they accumulated in cells, as they have no metabolic function. These potentially damaging compounds are called xenobiotics. Xenobiotics such as synthetic drugs, natural poisons and antibiotics are detoxified {{by a set of}} xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. In humans, these include cytochrome P450 oxidases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and glutathione S-transferases. This system of enzymes acts in three stages to firstly oxidize the xenobiotic (phase I) and then conjugate water-soluble groups onto the molecule (phase II). The modified water-soluble xenobiotic can then be pumped out of cells and in multicellular organisms may be further metabolized before being excreted (phase III). In ecology, these reactions are particularly important in microbial biodegradation of pollutants and the bioremediation of contaminated land and oil spills. Many of these microbial reactions are shared with multicellular organisms, but due to the incredible diversity of types of microbes these organisms are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with a far wider range of xenobiotics than multicellular organisms, and can degrade even persistent organic pollutants such as organochloride compounds.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary Hittite texts {{indicate}} the presence of Ahhiyawa, which strengthened its position in western Anatolia from c. 1400 to c. 1220 BC. Ahhiyawa is generally accepted as a Hittite translation of Mycenaean Greece (Achaeans in Homeric Greek). During this period, the kings of Ahhiyawa were clearly <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with the Hittite kings both in a military and diplomatic way. Ahhiyawa activity was to interfere in Anatolian affairs, {{with the support of}} anti-Hittite uprisings or through local vassal rulers, which the king of the Ahhiyawa used as agents for the extension of his influence. In one occasion, in c. 1400 BC, Attarsiya (a possible Hittite translation of Atreus) launched a campaign deploying an army headed by war chariots and attacked regions which were under Hittite influence. Later, Attarsiya, invaded the island of Alashiya (Cyprus) together with a number of his Anatolian allies. The invading force finally succeeded in controlling the island and overthrowing the local Hittite authorities. The campaigns of Attarsiya represent the earliest recorded Mycenaean Greek military activity against the Hittites. The Hittite-Ahhiyawan confrontation in Wilusa, the Hittite name for Troy, in the 13th century BC may have provided the historical foundation for the Trojan War tradition.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1170s Henry focused {{on trying to}} create a stable system of government, {{increasingly}} ruling through his family, but tensions over the succession arrangements were never far away, ultimately leading to a fresh revolt. Having quelled the left-over rebels from the Great Revolt, Richard was recognised by Henry as the Duke of Aquitaine in 1179. In 1181 Geoffrey finally married Constance and became Duke of Brittany; by now most of Brittany accepted Angevin rule, and Geoffrey was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with the remaining disturbances on his own. John had spent the Great Revolt travelling alongside his father and most observers now began to regard the prince as Henry's favourite child. Henry began to grant John more lands, mostly at various nobles' expense, and in 1177 made him the Lord of Ireland. Meanwhile, Young Henry spent {{the end of the decade}} travelling in Europe, taking part in tournaments and playing only a passing role in either government or Henry and Richard's military campaigns; he was increasingly dissatisfied with his position and lack of power.|$|E
