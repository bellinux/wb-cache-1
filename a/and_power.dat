30|$|Matrice d’impacts croises-multipication applique´ an classment (cross-impact matrix {{multiplication}} {{applied to}} classification) is abbreviated as MICMAC (Mudgal et al. 2009). In the MICMAC analysis, the dependence <b>power</b> <b>and</b> driver <b>power</b> {{of the variables}} are analyzed. Variables will be classified into four clusters. The four clusters are autonomous, dependent, linkage, and driver/independent. In the final reachability matrix, the driving <b>power</b> <b>and</b> dependence <b>power</b> {{of each of the}} variables will be plotted. Autonomous variables (first cluster) have weak driving <b>power</b> <b>and</b> weak dependence <b>power.</b> These variables can be disconnected from the system. The second clusters named dependent variables have weak driving <b>power</b> <b>and</b> strong dependence <b>power.</b> The third cluster named linkage variables has strong driving <b>power</b> <b>and</b> strong dependence <b>power.</b> The fourth cluster named independent variables has strong driving <b>power</b> <b>and</b> weak dependence <b>power.</b>|$|R
