5|$|After {{losing his}} reelection bid in 1861, Stevenson, a known Confederate sympathizer, {{stayed out of}} public life {{during the war and}} was {{consequently}} able to avoid being imprisoned, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> Confederate sympathizers were. In 1867, just five days after John L. Helm and Stevenson were elected governor and lieutenant governor, respectively, Helm died and Stevenson became acting governor. Stevenson subsequently won a special election in 1868 to finish Helm's term. As governor, he opposed federal intervention in what he considered state matters but insisted that blacks' newly granted rights be observed and used the state militia to quell post-war violence in the state. Although a fiscal conservative, he advocated a new tax to benefit education and created the state bureau of education.|$|E

5|$|In April 2010, {{there were}} 6,260 people {{employed}} in the healthcare field in Lauderdale County. Rush Hospital is the largest healthcare organization in the region, employing 2,610 people, followed by East Mississippi State Hospital with 1,500 and Anderson Hospital with 1,475. There are three hospitals in Meridian, as well <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> healthcare-related facilities. Jeff Anderson Regional Medical Center provides cardiovascular surgery, a Level II newborn intensive-care unit, and a health and fitness center. Rush Foundation Hospital and the related Rush Health Systems operate a Specialty Hospital of Meridian, which offers long-term care for non-permanent patients who require more recovery time in a hospital setting. Riley Hospital has two centers for stroke treatment and rehabilitation services. Other healthcare facilities in Meridian include the Alliance Health Center and East Mississippi State Hospital, the latter {{of which has been}} in operation since 1882.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln, as well <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> {{leaders and}} {{citizens}} of the northern states, became increasingly impatient with McClellan's slowness to attack the Confederate forces still massed near Washington. The Union defeat at the minor Battle of Ball's Bluff near Leesburg in October added to the frustration and indirectly damaged McClellan. In December, the Congress formed a Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, which became a thorn {{in the side of}} many generals throughout the war, accusing them of incompetence and, in some cases, treason. McClellan was called as the first witness on December 23, but he contracted typhoid fever and could not attend. Instead, his subordinate officers testified, and their candid admissions that they had no knowledge of specific strategies for advancing against the Confederates raised many calls for McClellan's dismissal.|$|E
5|$|Lynott {{replaced}} Robertson with Gary Moore again, {{and around}} this time the band loosely joined forces with Steve Jones and Paul Cook of the Sex Pistols, and also with Chris Spedding and Jimmy Bain, to form The Greedy Bastards, who played {{a small number of}} gigs playing a varied selection of songs. In this way Lynott was able to align his band with the punk movement and avoid being tagged as a 'dinosaur' <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> 1970s rock bands had been.

5|$|The Ministry of External Relations {{negotiated}} diplomatic treaties, handled Soviet {{foreign affairs}} {{along with the}} International Department of the Central Committee and aided in the guidance of international communism and anti-imperialism, both strong themes of Soviet policy. Before Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary, the organisational structure of the MER mostly stayed the same. <b>As</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> Soviet agencies, the MER had an inner-policy group known as the Collegium, {{made up of the}} minister, the two first deputy ministers and nine deputy ministers, among others. Each deputy minister usually headed his own department.|$|E
5|$|The {{most stable}} oxide of {{samarium}} is the sesquioxide Sm2O3. <b>As</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> samarium compounds, {{it exists in}} several crystalline phases. The trigonal form is obtained by slow cooling from the melt. The melting point of Sm2O3 is rather high (2345°C) and therefore melting is usually achieved not by direct heating, but with induction heating, through a radio-frequency coil. The Sm2O3 crystals of monoclinic symmetry can be grown by the flame fusion method (Verneuil process) from the Sm2O3 powder, that yields cylindrical boules up to several centimeters long and about one centimeter in diameter. The boules are transparent when pure and defect-free and are orange otherwise. Heating the metastable trigonal Sm2O3 to 1900°C converts it to the more stable monoclinic phase. Cubic Sm2O3 has also been described.|$|E

5|$|York {{has been}} a major railway centre since the first line arrived in 1839 at the {{beginning}} of the railway age. For many years the city hosted the headquarters and works of the North Eastern Railway. York railway station is a principal stop on the East Coast Main Line from London to Newcastle and Edinburgh. It takes less than two hours to get to York from London by rail, with at least 25 direct trains each weekday. The station is also served by long distance trains on CrossCountry services linking Edinburgh and Newcastle with destinations in south and west England via Birmingham. TransPennine Express provide a frequent service of semi-fast trains linking York to Newcastle, Scarborough, Leeds, Manchester, Manchester Airport, and Liverpool. Local stopping services by Northern connect York to Selby, Harrogate, Hull, Leeds, Sheffield and many intermediate points, as well <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> stations across Greater Manchester and Lancashire.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{attempts}} to draw investment {{to the city}} after the hurricane, Galveston never returned to its levels of national importance or prosperity. Development was also hindered by {{the construction of the}} Houston Ship Channel, which brought the Port of Houston into competition with the natural harbor of the Port of Galveston for sea traffic. To further her recovery, and rebuild her population, Galveston actively solicited immigration. Through the efforts of Rabbi Henry Cohen and Congregation B'nai Israel, Galveston became the focus of an immigration plan called the Galveston Movement that, between 1907 and 1914, diverted roughly 10,000 Eastern European Jewish immigrants from the usual destinations of the crowded cities of the Northeastern United States. Additionally numerous other immigrant groups, including Greeks, Italians and Russian Jews, came to the city during this period. This immigration trend substantially altered the ethnic makeup of the island, as well <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> areas of Texas and the western U.S.|$|E
5|$|Like Wollstonecraft's first novel, , The Wrongs of Woman {{is heavily}} autobiographical; the two novels even repeat {{many of the}} same biographical details. After being {{abandoned}} by her lover and the father of her child, Gilbert Imlay (the model for Darnford), Wollstonecraft attempted to commit suicide. Her despair over these events is written into the book as well <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> experiences from the mid-1790s. Moreover, Maria Venables's family history shows clear similarities to Wollstonecraft's own. Like Maria, Wollstonecraft had a mother who favored an elder brother and she also devotedly cared for that mother during her dying days, only to be pushed away during the final moments of her life. Wollstonecraft also looked after her sisters like Maria does, albeit without the help of a wealthy uncle. Perhaps most strikingly, Wollstonecraft's sister Eliza left her husband, at Wollstonecraft's prodding, much as Maria leaves hers. As Kelly explains, autobiography is common in Jacobin novels. Philosophical novels were expected to be autobiographical; audiences believed that the philosophizing novelists would draw on their own experiences in order to illustrate their abstract principles.|$|E
