25|$|In {{a meeting}} with the British Ambassador Goschen, Bethmann Hollweg made the flagrantly false {{statement}} that Germany was trying to pressure Austria to abandon the war against Serbia. As Prince Henry of Prussia pretended that King George V had promised him that Britain would remain neutral, the Kaiser rejected Bethmann Hollweg's offer of a naval agreement with Britain, stating that Germany did not have to offer Britain <b>anything</b> <b>now</b> that King George had apparently promised his country's neutrality.|$|E
500|$|The Advisory Committee on Uranium {{reported}} to the President on November 1, 1939. While acknowledging that the science was unproven and that nuclear chain reaction {{was no more than}} a theoretical possibility, it foresaw that nuclear energy might be used as propulsion for submarines, and that an atomic bomb [...] "would provide a possible source of bombs with a destructiveness vastly greater than <b>anything</b> <b>now</b> known." [...] The committee recommended that the government purchase [...] of uranium oxide and [...] of graphite for chain reaction experiments. It also recommended that Einstein, Karl Compton, George B. Pegram, and Sachs be added to the committee. When he read the report, Sachs felt that it was too academic and failed to make its points forcefully.|$|E
500|$|It was {{not until}} after the victory at the Battle of Rafa that Chauvel was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George, but this {{particular}} order is awarded for important non-military service in a foreign country. It was not just his military service at Romani which had not been recognised, but also the service {{of all those who}} fought in the Anzac Mounted Division at Romani, at El Arish, at Magdhaba and at Rafa. In September 1917, not long after General Edmund Allenby became Commander in Chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, Chauvel wrote to GHQ to point out the injustice done to his front-line troops, acknowledging that it was [...] "difficult to do <b>anything</b> <b>now</b> to right this, but consider the Commander-in-Chief should {{know that there is a}} great deal of bitterness over it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why not? Please {{tell me why}} not?" [...] Richard begged. [...] "I am {{not asking}} for <b>anything</b> more <b>now</b> than just an {{opportunity}} to talk with her." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, made {{the development of}} an atomic bomb a theoretical possibility. There were fears that a German atomic bomb project would develop one first, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries. In August 1939, Hungarian-born physicists Leó Szilárd and Eugene Wigner drafted the Einstein–Szilárd letter, which warned of the potential development of [...] "extremely powerful bombs of a new type". It urged the United States to take steps to acquire stockpiles of uranium ore and accelerate the research of Enrico Fermi and others into nuclear chain reactions. They had it signed by Albert Einstein and delivered to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt called on Lyman Briggs of the National Bureau of Standards to head the Advisory Committee on Uranium to investigate the issues raised by the letter. Briggs held a meeting on 21 October 1939, which was attended by Szilárd, Wigner and Edward Teller. The committee reported back to Roosevelt in November that uranium [...] "would provide a possible source of bombs with a destructiveness vastly greater than <b>anything</b> <b>now</b> known." ...|$|E

2500|$|Aniston {{said she}} had undiagnosed dyslexia, which had {{affected}} her education and self-esteem, and that after being diagnosed in her 20s, her outlook toward life changed. She stated, [...] "I thought I wasn't smart. I just couldn't retain <b>anything.</b> <b>Now</b> I had this great discovery. I felt like all of my childhood trauma-dies, tragedies, dramas were explained." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Give {{me another}} mouthful of that brandy and I shall {{be ready for}} <b>anything.</b> So! <b>Now,</b> if you will help me up. What do you propose to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{intend to}} pity you, Mr. Rodney," [...] Mary remarked, kindly, but firmly. [...] "When a paper's a failure, nobody says <b>anything,</b> whereas <b>now,</b> {{just listen to}} them!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm {{not going}} to do <b>anything</b> just <b>now,</b> I tell you. Don't be in a fright. I shan't take French leave of you. You'll find me to-morrow morning, worse luck. Good night.' ...|$|R
60|$|He hesitated. After all, it was {{scarcely}} worth while concealing <b>anything</b> <b>now.</b>|$|E
60|$|Isobel Hannay {{had taken}} {{no part in}} the first {{discussion}} among the ladies, nor did she say <b>anything</b> <b>now.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'H'm!' said Torpenhow, 'can't say I {{care for}} Verestchagin-and-water myself, but there's no {{accounting}} for tastes. Doing <b>anything</b> <b>now,</b> are you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Better that I {{should be}} at Clawbonny--if <b>anything</b> can <b>now</b> do me good, brother, it will be native air, and pure country air. Hearken to my request, and stop at the creek." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{tell you}} what this has cost me, Ralph," [...] she said. [...] "No, you must not say <b>anything</b> just <b>now.</b> Give me time to think; I can hardly bear it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don’t know," [...] said Malcolm, shortly. [...] "I fancied I saw something, but {{it might}} have been fancy. I’m in the mood to see <b>anything</b> just <b>now.</b> How are you feeling now, sir?" ...|$|R
60|$|OCTAVIUS. She {{asked me}} how {{she could think of}} <b>anything</b> <b>now</b> but her dear father. She stifled a sob--[he breaks down].|$|E
6000|$|... "H'm!" [...] said Torpenhow, [...] "can'tsay I {{care for}} Verestchagin-and-water myself, but there's no {{accounting}} for tastes. Doing <b>anything</b> <b>now,</b> are you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you like," [...] she answered; [...] "but I don't believe I shall hear <b>anything</b> <b>now.</b> Somehow--since {{that last}} business--everything seems {{different}} to me." ...|$|E
60|$|LADY BRITOMART. You didn't think, Charles. You never do; and {{the result}} is, you never mean <b>anything.</b> And <b>now</b> please attend to me, children. Your father will be quite a {{stranger}} to us.|$|R

6000|$|... "God bless you, madam!" [...] said Tantripp, with an irrepressible {{movement}} of love towards the beautiful, gentle creature for whom she felt {{unable to do}} <b>anything</b> more, <b>now</b> that she had finished tying the bonnet.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{tell you}} <b>anything,</b> just <b>now,</b> Captain Putnam," [...] he {{answered}} slowly. [...] "But I've got {{something of an}} idea of how that box got here. But I'd hate to accuse anybody unless I was sure of it." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{characters}} {{occupy a}} huge rundown {{house in a}} bleak, depressing landscape with nothing around seemingly for miles.

6000|$|... "Oh, if I {{only had}} a brass andiron-knob again! But I haven't got <b>anything</b> <b>now</b> to {{remember}} him by." [...] And she choked back a little sob.|$|E

6000|$|... "My dear, you flatter me. I {{certainly}} have had {{my share of}} beauty, but I do not pretend to be <b>anything</b> extraordinary <b>now.</b> When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What {{a pretty}} {{carriage}} you have! I {{do not think}} I shall ever get into mine again. I am almost glad they have destroyed my chariot. I am sure I shall {{never be able to}} drive in <b>anything</b> else <b>now</b> except a brougham.' ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the first}} glance he {{suffered}} a bitter disappointment; never before had he so yearned for <b>anything</b> as <b>now</b> he did for the ability to interpret a message from that golden-haired divinity who had come so suddenly and so unexpectedly into his life.|$|R
