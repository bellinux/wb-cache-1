50|$|Large Diesel {{generators}} {{and almost all}} Diesel engines used as the prime mover of ships use compressed air acting directly on the cylinder head. This is not ideal for smaller Diesels, as it provides too much cooling on starting. Also, the cylinder head needs to have enough space to support an extra valve for the air start system. The air start system is conceptually very similar to a distributor in a car. There is an <b>air</b> <b>distributor</b> that is geared to the camshaft of the Diesel engine; {{on the top of}} the <b>air</b> <b>distributor</b> is a single lobe similar to what is found on a camshaft. Arranged radially around this lobe are roller tip followers for every cylinder. When the lobe of the <b>air</b> <b>distributor</b> hits one of the followers it will send an air signal that acts upon the back of the air start valve located in the cylinder head, causing it to open. Compressed air is provided from a large reservoir that feeds into a header located along the engine. As soon as the air start valve is opened, the compressed air is admitted and the engine will begin turning. It can be used on 2-cycle and 4-cycle engines and on reversing engines. On large 2-stroke engines less than one revolution of the crankshaft is needed for starting.|$|E

40|$|The {{demands on}} climate control in animal houses {{increases}} as the methods for production improve. The relationship between maximum and minimum ventilation rate in Swedish houses for fattening pigs, around 1 : 15, causes {{problems with the}} distribution of fresh air. The same type of inlets for fresh air are usually used under both ventilation rate conditions. Independently of the ventilation rate the inlets should offer thermal comfort. A prototype to a new inlet (<b>air</b> <b>distributor)</b> has been developed by Sveaverken Agri AB {{as an attempt to}} solve the distribution problem within a wide range of thermal conditions. The prototype consists of a vertical air penetrable textile tube and a bottom which can be lowered creating a circular slotted inlet. This project was initiated by Sveaverken Agri AB in order to test the inlet on a farm with pig production. The aim of the study was to: - identify the demands of thermal environment in a house for finishing pigs by a literature review - compare two inlets for fresh air, the new prototype and a conventional slotted inlet A house containing two compartments for finishing pigs was used for the study, one of the compartments had slotted inlets and the other one the new prototype. Tests were made during summer conditions, 1996. Animal growth and health aspects were excluded from the study. The literature review shows that temperatures between 15 and 25 °C are suitable for finishing pigs. The air speed can vary between 0, 2 and 0, 8 m/s, lower air speeds during lower temperatures and faster when it is warmer. The idea behind the <b>air</b> <b>distributor</b> has been to provide the pigs with a slow, diffuse air movement during the winter and stronger air stream during the summer. A tube of textile is used for distribution of fresh air when the incoming air is cold. As the temperature rises in the house the <b>air</b> <b>distributor</b> opens and the airflow pattern changes to reach the animals directly. Measurements were made to study the abilities of the <b>air</b> <b>distributor</b> considering the expected air flow pattern. The compartment with slotted inlets was used as a reference. The construction of the <b>air</b> <b>distributor</b> was expected two induce greater convective cooling than the slotted inlets. During the test period several parameters were measured two compare the two different air inlets. In each compartment respectively temperatures and air humidity were registered by computer loggers, inside as well as outside the stable. The effect of convective cooling was considered by calculating the chill factor. For this reason air speed, skin- and air temperature were measured in tree pens in each compartment. Smoke was used to trace the air flow pattern. The pen and animal hygiene was controlled in 13 pens in each compartment. The static pressure between each compartment and the attic was measured to find possible differences in the regulation of the ventilation systems. Occasionally the concentration of carbondioxide was measured to calculate the ventilation rate. The results from the measurements show that the new <b>air</b> <b>distributor</b> has a greater capability to stratify the temperature than the slotted inlets. This was proved by calculating the differences between temperatures at pen level and the average temperature in each compartment. Both inlets showed greatest temperature differences when the incoming air was cold. The lowest temperature measured of incoming air was - 5 °C, which gives a 20 °C difference (∆t) between temperature of the stable and the incoming air. Calculations of the chill factor proved no greater difference between the two air inlets. The slotted inlets showed slightly higher values. Non of the inlets reached the recommended level of 60 - 80 W/m 2. The study of the air flow pattern showed that a lower ∆t reduced the ability of incoming air to reach the lying area of the pens, independently of the type of inlet. The <b>air</b> <b>distributor</b> was expected to direct incoming air towards the lying area. This ability was proved to be overestimated. The fast air stream passed above animal level. A comparison between air and skin temperatures implied that the cooling effect was higher with the air distributors than the slotted inlets. This was confirmed by the results from the study of hygiene. Animals and pens reached a better level of hygiene with the new inlet. Knowledge of the concentration of carbondioxide and relative humidity of air was used to estimate the ventilation rate in each compartment. The calculated ventilation rates were higher in the compartment with slotted inlets, despite equivalent exhaust fans. Non of the compartments reached the Swedish recommendations for maximum ventilation rate. Minor adjustments were made to improve the ability of the new inlet to direct incoming air towards the lying areas in the pens. This effects of these adjustments were not studied carefully but the air speed seemed to increase over the lying area. Considering the results, the new inlet functions at least as well as ordinary slotted inlets during summer conditions. The <b>air</b> <b>distributor</b> has several advantages, greater capability to stratify temperature, greater cooling effect under warm conditions and with that better pen and animal hygiene. The adjustments of the new inlet seem to improve the ability to convective cooling. The new inlet has not been tested during winter conditions but by adjusting the inlet height above floor level, there should be no difficulty to prevent cold air from falling down on the animals...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{contrast}} to traditional coal separation, dry separation {{does not require}} water and does not cause water pollution. Dense phase gas–solid fluidized beds are used for dry separation. The plugged holes in the <b>air</b> <b>distributor</b> should be tested to ensure the stability of these beds for particle separation. The pressure fluctuation is sensitive to these plugged holes. This sensitivity can be tested and diagnosed by determining the standard deviation of the pressure fluctuation. In areas with partial blockage, that is the areas with weak fluidization, {{a decrease in the}} volume fraction of the particles and in the pressure differences in the transverse of the bed results in an increase of the standard deviation of the pressure fluctuation, thereby stimulating the lateral mixing of medium-sized particles. The standard deviation and the mixing intensity decrease axially. The value of sensitivity of the plugged holes in the <b>air</b> <b>distributor</b> decreases as the height of the bed increases. The features of air distributors affect the surrounding areas. The distribution law determining the influence of plugged holes on the beds is symmetrical. As the blockage of the fluidized bed distributor region increases, the mean square error of the pressure fluctuation in the related regions increases.

VadlaniThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} micro- and macro-scale aspects of solid state fermentation (SSF) for production of cellulolytic enzymes using fungal cultures. Included in the objectives were investigation of effect of physicochemical characteristics of substrate on enzymes production at micro-scale, and design, fabrication and analysis of solid-state bioreactor at macro-scale. In the initial studies response surface optimization of SSF of soybeans hulls using mixed culture of Trichoderma reesei and Aspergillus oryzae was carried out to standardize the process. Optimum temperature, moisture and pH of 30 ºC, 70 % and 5 were determined following optimization. Using optimized parameters laboratory scale-up in static tray fermenter was performed that resulted in production of complete and balanced cellulolytic enzyme system. The balanced enzyme system had required 1 : 1 ratio of filter paper and beta-glucosidase units. This complete and balanced enzyme system was shown to be effective in the hydrolysis of wheat straw to sugars. Mild pretreatments– steam, acid and alkali were performed to vary physicochemical characteristics of soybean hulls – bed porosity, crystallinity and volumetric specific surface. Mild nature of pretreatments minimized the compositional changes of substrate. It was explicitly shown that more porous and crystalline steam pretreated soybean hulls significantly improved cellulolytic enzymes production in T. reesei culture, with no effect on xylanase. In A. oryzae and mixed culture this improvement, though, was not seen. Further studies using standard crystalline substrates and substrates with varying bed porosity confirmed that effect of physicochemical characteristics was selective with respect to fungal species and cellulolytic activity. A novel deep bed bioreactor was designed and fabricated to address scale-up issues. Bioreactor’s unique design of outer wire mesh frame with internal air distribution and a near saturation environment within cabinet resulted in enhanced heat transfer with minimum moisture loss. Enzyme production was faster and leveled within 48 h of operation compared to 96 h required in static tray.

The model is {{coupled with a}} nonlinear constrained optimization algorithm to determine an optimum design of the fuel cell {{with respect to the}} operation and the geometrical parameters of cathode such as the air inlet pressure, the cathode thickness and length and the width of shoulders in the interdigitated <b>air</b> <b>distributor.</b> In addition, the robustness of the optimum design of the fuel cell with respect to uncertainties in several electrochemical reaction and species transport parameters (e. g., gas diffusivity, agglomerate particle size, etc.) is tested using a statistical sensitivity analysis. The results of the optimization analysis show that higher current densities at a constant cell voltage are obtained as the inlet air pressure and the fraction of the cathode length associated with a shoulder of the interdigitated <b>air</b> <b>distributor</b> are increased, and as the cathode thickness and the length of the cathode per one interdigitated gas distributor shoulder are decreased. The statistical sensitivity analysis results, on the other hand, show that the equilibrium cathode/membrane potential difference has the largest effect on the predicted polarization curve of the fuel cell. However, the optimal design of the cathode side of the fuel cell is found not to be affected by the uncertainties in the model parameters such as the equilibrium cathode/membrane potential difference. The results obtained are rationalized in terms of the effect of the fuel-cell design on the air flow fields and the competition between the rates of species transport to and from the cathode active layer and the kinetics of the oxygen reduction half-reaction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The new {{geometrical}} {{design of}} stand-pipe <b>air</b> <b>distributor</b> for the combustion {{of the municipal}} solid waste was presented. The new design of the air distributors enables penetration of incombustible and unburnt carbon through opening between the air distributors, thus providing easy maintenance work. The fluidized bed experimental rig was constructed using Perspex column in which air was supplied through the distributors below it. In order to establish the final geometrical design of the air distributors, several design parameters were investigated. The effect of orifice size, distance between orifice and distance between distributor pipes on the fluidization behaviour were studied. Investigation {{on the effects of}} various orifice sizes of 1. 5 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm, 4 mm and 5 mm showed that the 3 mm orifice size exhibited the most stable fluidization behaviour. Investigatio...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} two-fluid code, Gemini 2 D, {{was adapted}} to study gas-solid fluidization in arbitrary 2 D domains. The code {{was also used}} to study fluid dynamic mechanisms of dense particle flow that cause ductile and brittle erosion of solids. Simulations of the in-bed fluid dynamics of a small-scale pressurized fluidized bed were made with and without internals. The inflow and outflow system of a small-scale bed was studied, where the air-feed system - incorporating an air inflow system, plenum chamber and distributor plate - was modelled. It {{was found that the}} simulated large-scale fluid dynamics was significantly improved when a model was included for the air feed system of the bed. In particular, at atmospheric operating conditions, it was found that regular pressure fluctuations occurred at a constant frequency, in good agreement with experimental observations for a slugging bed behaviour. These pressure fluctuations correlate well with a strong temporal variation in the total inflow of air. Animated sequences of the slugging bed behaviour resemble that of a piston-like motion of the major part of the bed mass. Previous modelling of the same bed when a constant influx of <b>air</b> through the <b>distributor</b> plate is assumed resulted in large discrepancies between simulated and experimental bed behaviour. It is concluded {{that it is necessary to}} include complementary operating parameters to describe the present fluidized bed system, as the standard operating parameters such as fluidization velocity and operating pressure are not sufficient. A simple erosion model was used to study erosion of cooling tubes for a bed containing two tubes. This model, the monolayer kinetic energy dissipation erosion model, was used to study erosion mechanisms when bubbles pass a tube. In accordance with experimental observations, the impact of bubble wakes results in high instantaneous simulated erosion rates. Time-averaged local erosion rates around tubes were also modelled. This simple Eulerian erosion model was further developed to enable erosion modelling of real engineering metals subject to dense flow impacts of hard particles. The irreversible processes in the simulated flow field in the vicinity of a solid eroding surface can be divided into two fundamental components that can be associated with cutting and deformation wear, respectively. Ductile and brittle erosion were simulated for stationary jet streams of particles impacting a tilted plate. The influence of particle diameter, particle concentration, jet velocity and jet diameter was investigated. The literature has a great many reports of erosion models that can be applied in the case of dilute flows and in studies of single particle impacts. However, these models - generally Lagrangian - are here argued to be difficult to implement successfully for dense flows causing erosion. Examples of such cases are sandblasting or erosion caused by a large collection of particles, which is common in bubbling fluidized beds...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the air {{distribution}} system in a fluidised bed combustor {{is to provide a}} reasonably uniform spread of combustion air over the entire horizontal cross-sectional area of the bed. One of the simplest, and hence cheapest, forms of <b>air</b> <b>distributor</b> is the sparge pipe design, in which an array of horizontal pipes is fitted {{at the base of the}} bed. Combustion air is then supplied to one end of each pipe and is subsequently distributed to the bed through a series of downward facing holes. The paper describes the development of an improved sparge pipe system for a large coal fired fluidised bed producing hot combustion gases for drying of pressed sugar beet pulp. The air flow out of the holes varied by a factor of three along the length of the pipes with the existing system and in addition the overall flow and hence the thermal output of the bed was unduly restricted. Excessive erosion of the pipe walls near some of the holes was also a problem. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study was undertaken of the flows along the pipes using FLUENT and the results validated by flow and pressure measurements on full scale laboratory models. The flow distribution was substantially improved and the overall flow rate increased by approximately 9 % by varying the hole diameters and pitches. Wear tests were also undertaken in near ambient temperature fluidised beds using multiple thin layers of different coloured paints on the outside of the pipes to assess the erosion patterns. These patterns were found to be similar to those observed on actual sparge pipes removed from the combustor at the end of an operating campaign. The rate of wear can be substantially reduced by reducing the angle of inclination of the downward facing holes in the pipes. Consequently an improved sparge pipe <b>air</b> <b>distributor</b> was designed for this large fluidised bed combustor. 1...|$|E
40|$|Important {{features}} for numerical {{investigation of the}} fluid dynamics of industrially-sized fluidized-bed converters are investigated. Emphasis is put on the significance of inlet boundary conditions for simulations of the units. Simulations of a stationary fluidized bed are carried out as a step towards computations of a circulating fluidized-bed reactor. The simulations are based on an Eulerian approach, using the kinetic theory of granular flow. The results are compared with time-averaged measurements (mean concentration of particles) and local instantaneous pressure measurements. The simulations show satisfactory agreement with experiments, which demonstrates that the assumption of a uniform inlet gas flow over the <b>air</b> <b>distributor</b> is not appropriate in numerical studies of beds operated under the conditions of industrial units. It is concluded that fluctuations in pressure and flow in the air-supply system {{have to be taken}} into account when formulating the inlet conditions for the calculations...|$|E
