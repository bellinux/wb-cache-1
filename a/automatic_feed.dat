This {{was in part}} because of innovative product development at the Halifax site which ultimately produced the CR P5 and P6 profiling lathes: the conclusion of this development is described by Jeremy as being a range of [...] "fully automatic, multi-tool and profiling lathes. A lathe with an <b>automatic</b> <b>feed</b> and delivery heralded an automatic machine tool production line." [...] The expansion of the motor vehicle industry once again was a significant factor, driving demand for machine tools much as the bicycling boom of the 1890s had done. In 1957 the Scotswood operation moved across the River Tyne to Blaydon, where a factory was built especially for the manufacturing purpose intended. Among other products from that site was the Vertimax lathe, which used a vertical spindle and was of interest to motor vehicle manufacturers. This particular design originated from James Anderson, a garage owner in Glasgow, during the war and whose business was brought into the Churchill group of companies. Churchill Gear Machines Ltd was part of the group, having been established in Blaydon since 1956: the cause of its origin and the nature of its products is uncertain.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> device {{occupies}} the irreplaceable {{position in the}} development of industrial automation. An <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> device is often required to convey parts to complete a series of processes in a modern production line. But the traditional <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> device has problems of large volume, high noise and low efficiency. It has reduced the efficiency of production line. So it is necessary to make innovation for the <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> system. A new type of <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> device based on linear servo motor is proposed in the paper. This device overcomes some disadvantages of the traditional <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> device. 1...|$|R

The height of the table can be adjusted to suit this workpiece, and the table can traverse sideways underneath the reciprocating tool, which is mounted on the ram.

5000|$|Engine lathe is {{the name}} applied to a {{traditional}} late-19th-century or 20th-century lathe with <b>automatic</b> <b>feed</b> to the cutting tool, as opposed to early lathes which were used with hand-held tools, or lathes with manual feed only. The usage of [...] "engine" [...] here is in the mechanical-device sense, not the prime-mover sense, as in the steam engines which were the standard industrial power source for many years. The works would have one large steam engine which would provide power to all the machines via a line shaft system of belts. Therefore, early engine lathes were generally 'cone heads', in that the spindle usually had attached to it a multi-step pulley called a cone pulley designed to accept a flat belt. Different spindle speeds could be obtained by moving the flat belt to different steps on the cone pulley. Cone-head lathes usually had a countershaft (layshaft) {{on the back side}} of the cone which could be engaged to provide a lower set of speeds than was obtainable by direct belt drive. These gears were called back gears. Larger lathes sometimes had two-speed back gears which could be shifted to provide a still lower set of speeds.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the metal}} {{percussion}} cap {{was the most}} popular and widely used type of primer, their small size made them difficult to handle under the stress of combat or while riding a horse. Accordingly, several manufacturers developed alternative, [...] "auto-priming" [...] systems. The [...] "Maynard tape primer", for example, used a roll of paper [...] "caps" [...] much like today's toy cap gun. The Maynard tape primer was fitted to some firearms used in the mid-nineteenth century and a few saw brief use in the American Civil War. Other disc or pellet-type primers held a supply of tiny fulminate detonator discs in a small magazine. Cocking the hammer automatically advanced a disc into position. However, these <b>automatic</b> <b>feed</b> systems were difficult to make with the manufacturing systems in the early and mid-nineteenth century and generated more problems than they solved. They were quickly shelved in favor of a single percussion cap that, while awkward to handle in some conditions, could be carried in sufficient quantities to make up for occasionally dropping one while a jammed tape primer system reduced the rifle to an awkward club.|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{the current}} study was to {{evaluate}} the clinical/health status of veal calves in 3 farms that adopt large group housing and <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> stations in Italy. Visits were scheduled in three phases of the rearing cycle (early, middle, and end). Results showed a high incidence of coughing, skin infection and bloated rumen particularly in the middle phase while cross-sucking signs were present at the early stage when calves’ nibbling proclivity is still high. Throughout the rearing cycle, the frequency of bursitis increased reaching 53 % of calves at the end. The percentage of calves with a poorer body condition than the mid-range of the batch raised gradually as well, likely due to the non-proportioned teat/calves ratio that increases competition for feed and reduces milk intake of the low ranking animals. The remarked growth differences among pen-mates and the mortality rate close to 7 % showed by the use of <b>automatic</b> <b>feeding</b> devices for milk delivery seem not compensating the lower labour demand, therefore its sustainability at the present status is doubtful both for the veal calves’ welfare and the farm incomes...|$|R
