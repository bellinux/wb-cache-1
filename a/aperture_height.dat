40|$|Cleats {{are natural}} opening-mode {{fractures}} in coal beds. They account {{for most of}} the permeability and much of the porosity of coalbed gas reservoirs and can {{have a significant effect on}} the success of engineering procedures such as cavity stimulations. Because permeability and stimulation success are commonly limiting factors in gas well performance, knowledge of cleat characteristics and origins is essential for successful exploration and production. Although the coal–cleat literature spans at least 160 years, mining issues have been the principal focus, and quantitative data are almost exclusively limited to orientation and spacing information. Few data are available on <b>apertures,</b> <b>heights,</b> lengths, connectivity, and the relation of cleat formation to diagenesis, characteristics that are critical to permeability. Moreover, recent studies of cleat orientation patterns and fracture style suggest that new investigations of even these well-studied parameters can yield insight into coal permeability. More effective predictions of cleat patterns will come from advances in understanding cleat origins. Although cleat formation has been speculatively attributed to diagenetic andror tectonic processes, a viable mechanical process for creating cleats has yet to be demonstrated. Progress in this area may come from recent developments in fracture mechanics and in coal geochemistry. q 1998 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R

All these dimensions added up to a comfortable (albeit low) car with decent comfort and presence. The boot space was more than adequate, at over 300 L in capacity. Due to the way the backseats lean back (which in turn gave the rear passengers a lot more comfort), objects over 1000 mm in length and 1200 mm in width could fit.

A {{two-dimensional}} turbulence k-ε {{model is}} used to predict the distribution of air velocity, temperature and turbulence kinetic energy in a ventilated room using different positions of inlet and outlet apertures.

This study {{is focused on the}} prediction of turbulent recirculating flows in large indoor spaces. The results show that the wall jet region and recirculation regions are affected by the position of inlet and outlet apertures.

30|$|Based on {{the types}} of {{production}} mechanism, the GAGD process could be divided into three types: free fall gravity drainage (FFGD), forced gravity drainage (FGD), and controlled gravity drainage (CGD) (Zendehboudi et al. 2011). There are several parameters including rock permeability, spreading coefficients 2 of the involved fluids, injection or production rate, oil viscosity, three phase relative permeabilities, and capillary pressure which affect the performance of GAGD. Since then, the influence of these parameters on the ultimate oil recovery during GAGD process has been investigated by several authors. Terwillinger et al. (1951) showed insignificant role of maximum theoretical gravity drainage rate, and a strong dependency between ultimate recovery and production rate. In contrast, the same or even better ultimate oil recovery at higher production rates in controlled gravity drainage (CGD) were reported by Chatzis and Ayatollahi (1993). In their experiment, homogeneous, water-wet unconsolidated media and positive oil spreading coefficients were utilized. In another work, they also reported the effect of layered permeability type of heterogeneous pore structure on the production characteristics of the gravity-assisted inert gas-injection process (Chatzis and Ayatollahi 1995).

5000|$|The initial SMPTE {{definition}} for anamorphic projection with an {{optical sound track}} down the side (PH22.106-1957), issued in December 1957, standardized the projector aperture at 0.839 xx 0.715 in (aspect ratio 1.17:1). The aspect ratio for this aperture, after a 2x unsqueeze, is 2.3468…:1 which rounded to the commonly used value 2.35:1. A new definition was issued in October 1970 (PH22.106-1971) which specified a slightly smaller vertical dimension of 0.700 in. for the projector aperture to help make splices less noticeable to film viewers. Four-perf anamorphic prints use more of the negative's available frame area than any other modern format which leaves little room for splices; as a consequence, a bright line would flash onscreen when a splice was projected and theater projectionists had been narrowing the vertical aperture to hide these flashes even before issuance of PH22.106-1971. This new projector aperture size, 0.838 xx 0.700 in, aspect ratio 1.1971…:1, made for an un-squeezed ratio of 2.39:1 (and commonly referred to by the rounded value 2.40:1 or 2.4:1). The most recent revision, from August 1993 (SMPTE 195-1993), slightly altered the dimensions so as to standardize a common projection aperture width (0.825 in) for all formats, anamorphic (2.39:1) and flat (1.85:1).

INTRODUCTION: Graves' ophthalmopathy is {{the main cause of}} eye proptosis. Because these protrusions cause clinically perceived distortions in orbital architecture, digital photographs can be used to detect and quantify these changes. METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional study comprising 12 healthy volunteers and 15 Graves' ophthalmopathy patients with the purpose of evaluating the use of simple, non-invasive digital photography to estimate oculometric parameters of Graves' ophthalmopathy and compare them with the parameters of unaffected eyes. Facial photographs of cases and controls were taken in a standardized manner. Oculometric parameters were compared between the groups and then correlated to proptometer measures. RESULTS: All estimated oculometric variables showed significant differences between the groups, in particular with regard to mediopupilar <b>aperture,</b> lateral <b>height,</b> distance from the iris edge to the lateral boundary of the palpebral fissure, and distance from the higher point of the iris to the lateral limit of the palpebral fissure. The product of medial aperture and horizontal palpebral fissure also revealed greater discrepancy between the groups. Proptometer measures showed significant linear correlation between the distance from the iris edge to the lateral boundary of the palpebral fissure and between the distance from the higher point of the iris to the lateral limit of palpebral fissure (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Comparative analysis of oculometric parameters in Graves' ophthalmopathy suggests that eye proptosis is related to an asymmetric increase in lateral oculometric measures.

It {{can be carried out}} through qualitative or quantitative analysis of morphological parameters of dimorphism. The shape of the piriform aperture is one of the classic indicators of sexual dimorphism since it describes differences between males and females according to strong population-specific behavior. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze the presence of sexual dimorphism in the size of the piriform aperture and its relationship with individual skin color. We used 90 human skulls from the Collection of the Federal Universidad de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), with registered data on sex, age and skin color (classified as white, black and brown). The dimensions studied were: height, upper width and lower width of piriform aperture. All dimensions were greater in males than females, however, only the piriform <b>aperture</b> <b>height</b> was found to be significant with p < 0. 01. By analyzing differences and grouping them according skin color, the piriform <b>aperture</b> <b>height</b> was found to be significantly higher (p < 0. 05) in white, black and brown males. In the group of black individuals skulls, we found significant differences in the upper width (p < 0. 05). The main differences, related to the piriform <b>aperture</b> <b>height</b> and the low influence of skin color in the presence of sexual dimorphism in the piriform aperture size, are in contrast with what has been reported in the literature and justify the revision of the classic indicators used for diagnosis of sex in specific populations.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 44 - 50). Predation is {{an important}} process that has both direct and indirect effects on species and communities. Many prey species utilize refuge habitat and exhibit gregarious behavior {{to reduce the risk}} of predation, and these strategies may be particularly advantageous to early life stages that are highly susceptible to predators. In this study, I worked with the California spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus Randall) to explore patterns in habitat utilization and sheltering behavior on southern California rocky reefs, and to determine how these associations and behaviors influence survival of subadult (5. 0 - 6. 0 cm carapace length, CL) lobsters. The California spiny lobster is a gregarious, shelter-dwelling species whose distribution, abundance, and survival may be closely tied to habitat structure at a variety of scales, particularly for subadult lobsters that are vulnerable to a variety of predators. It is also an economically and ecologically valuable species that is among those targeted for protection in California's recently established South Coast Region marine protected areas (MPAs). Many ecological processes are tied to species-habitat interactions, and MPAs may have little impact on populations if appropriate and complex habitat is lacking within an MPA. Therefore, an important component of my study was to provide baseline information on spiny lobster behavior and habitat associations that may be used in future efforts to determine whether MPAs are positively affecting P. interruptus populations, and if behavioral shifts occur due to changing conditions within MPAs. In part one of my study, I assessed habitat characteristics and lobster behavior (habitat associations and shelter use) within and outside of four of the South Coast Region MPAs within southern California's heavily fished coastal waters. To link lobster presence and behavior to benthic habitat features at the regional level, and to determine if these linkages vary among locations, I conducted SCUBA-based transect surveys of rocky reefs within and outside of each MPA. I recorded substrate composition, relief, and dominant vegetation cover to characterize habitat, as well as the number, size, and shelter type utilized by all lobsters encountered. I found that substrate composition and algal assemblage varied across the region and that each MPA had distinct habitat characteristics. As a result, the odds of finding lobsters were related to different habitat variables within each MPA, and no single benthic feature reliably predicted the occurrence of lobsters across the entire study region. Lobster density varied only slightly across MPAs, and lobsters were generally gregarious across the study region. However, lobster sheltering behavior varied among MPAs, which may be due to variation in habitat parameters and biotic factors (e. g., predation risk and intraspecific interactions) across the southern California region. In part two of my study, I determined the impact of lobster behavior on survival for subadult California spiny lobsters. Working in the La Jolla State Marine Reserve (SMR), I conducted tethering experiments using standardized artificial shelters to examine (1) how shelter size influences relative survival for solitary subadult lobsters, and (2) how the size of conspecifics affects survival of grouped subadult lobsters. I also conducted a laboratory-based shelter selection experiment to examine how the presence of potential predators impacts subadult shelter choice, and used data from my transect surveys to determine whether behaviors in naturally occurring shelters corresponded to optimal antipredator strategies and to lab-based shelter preferences. Proportional survival was highest for subadults tethered to shelters with reduced <b>aperture</b> <b>heights,</b> indicating that shelters more closely scaled to body size offer more protection from predators. This corresponded to a weak but significant relationship between lobster body size and shelter height on naturally occurring rocky reefs. Being grouped with adult vs. subadult conspecifics also promoted lobster survival, which corresponded to results from my laboratory experiments, in which subadults selected shelters with adult conspecifics in the presence of predators, and trends on naturally occurring rocky reefs where subadult lobsters more often shelter with adult vs. subadult conspecifics. Overall, my results indicate that antipredator strategies of California spiny lobsters are similar to those of other spiny lobster species, but that lobsters associate with different habitat types across the locations I surveyed. My study provides a more comprehensive examination of California spiny lobster behavior than has previously been available, and provides baseline information on behaviors and habitat associations that rarely are available when evaluating MPA effectiveness...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} render spherical {{aberration}} and the {{deviation from the}} sine condition small throughout the whole aperture, there is given to a ray with a finite angle of aperture u* (width infinitely distant objects: with a finite height of incidence h*) the same distance of intersection, and the same sine ratio as to one neighboring the axis (u* or h* may not be {{much smaller than the}} largest aperture U or H {{to be used in the}} system). The rays with an angle of aperture smaller than u* would not have the same distance of intersection and the same sine ratio; these deviations are called zones, and the constructor endeavors to reduce these to a minimum. The same holds for the errors depending upon the angle of the field of view, w: astigmatism, curvature of field and distortion are eliminated for a definite value, w*, zones of astigmatism, curvature of field and distortion, attend smaller values of w. The practical optician names such systems: corrected for the angle of <b>aperture</b> u* (the <b>height</b> of incidence h*) or the angle of field of view w*. Spherical aberration and changes of the sine ratios are often represented graphically as functions of the aperture, in the same way as the deviations of two astigmatic image surfaces of the image plane of the axis point are represented as functions of the angles of the field of view.|$|R
