5|$|In {{the control}} and living spaces, the ship had quieted down, too. Orders were given in low voices; the men speak to each other, {{carrying}} out their normal duties, in a repressed atmosphere. A regular pall has descended upon us. I know that all hands <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decision and {{recognize the need for}} it. Perhaps they are relieved {{that they did not have}} to make it. But it is apparent that this unexpected illness, something that could neither have been foreseen nor prevented, may ruin our submergence record.|$|E

5|$|Correspondent {{segments}} {{feature a}} rotating supporting cast, and involve the show's members travelling to different locations to file comedic reports on current news stories and conduct interviews with people {{related to the}} featured issue. Topics have varied widely; {{during the early years}} of the show they tended toward character-driven human interest stories such as Bigfoot enthusiasts. Since Stewart began hosting in 1999, the focus of the show has become more political and the field pieces have come to more closely reflect current issues and debates. Under Kilborn and the early years of Stewart, most interviewees were either unaware or not entirely aware of the comedic nature of The Daily Show. However, as the show began to gain popularity—particularly following its coverage of the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections—most of the subjects now interviewed <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> comedic element.|$|E
5|$|Fenton and Licht {{note that}} the effect of a rattlesnake's {{rattling}} could be deimatic (startle) in inexperienced animals, whether predators or large animals that might injure the snake by stepping on it, but aposematic (a warning signal) in animals that <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rattle's meaning. They refer to the work of Fenton and his colleague David Bates on the responses of the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, to the defensive clicks made by moths in the family Arctiidae, which includes the garden tiger moth, Arctia caja. This family includes large, furry, bitter-tasting or poisonous moths. They found that while sounds can startle inexperienced bats, after a few trials the bats ignored the sounds if the prey was edible; but the same sounds can warn experienced bats of bitter-tasting prey (an honest signal).|$|E
5|$|In the Halo universe, {{humans had}} {{advanced}} to a comparable level {{of technology to}} the Forerunners but, after losing a war with them, all human technology was destroyed and their intelligence reduced, leaving them in a subsistence economy with measures to prevent redevelopment of electronics. Humans <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other, space-faring races, but their interactions are limited to visits from Forerunners as {{they do not have}} the technology to make contact themselves, they live in wooden buildings and have only primitive steam engines. The San'Shyuum (or Prophets as they are referred to in the Halo games) were also defeated by the Forerunners but their technology was not destroyed; they were instead confined to their home solar system and forbidden to manufacture weapons.|$|E

When discontinuing clozapine, gradual dose reduction is recommended to reduce the intensity of withdrawal effects.|$|E
25|$|A {{large portion}} of risk {{prevention}} focuses on adolescents.

While adolescents <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> risk, this awareness does not change behavior habits. Adolescents with strong positive optimistic bias toward risky behaviors had an overall increase in the optimistic bias with age.|$|E

25|$|On July 14, 2008, Viacom {{compromised}} {{to protect}} YouTube users' personal data in their $1billion copyright lawsuit. Google agreed it will anonymize user information and internet protocol addresses from its YouTube subsidiary before handing the data over to Viacom. The privacy deal also applied to other litigants including the FA Premier League, the Rodgers & Hammerstein {{organization and the}} Scottish Premier League. The deal however did not extend the anonymity to employees, because Viacom wishes to prove that Google staff <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uploading of illegal material to the site.

25|$|Littlejohn {{was accused}} of taking {{insufficient}} care to check the facts before publishing an article critical of cookery writer and poverty campaigner Jack Monroe. Littlejohn suggested Monroe, who prefers the singular they pronoun, chose {{to give up their}} job; in fact Monroe's young boy was unsettled with a range of different carers. As Monroe had grown up in a home with foster children they <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> potential for harming him. Monroe tried unsuccessfully to negotiate flexible hours so they could work and look after their baby, but gave up their job so they could look after the child better. Littlejohn suggested incorrectly Monroe was an unemployed welfare claimant.|$|E

25|$|Raising both {{surveillance}} {{and awareness of}} the disease while medical researchers are developing a human vaccine can positively contribute towards prevention efforts. Research demonstrates that patients from endemic areas who <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease {{are most likely to}} request diagnostic testing for coccidioidomycosis. Presently, Meridian Bioscience manufactures the so-called EIA test to diagnose the Valley fever, which however is known for producing a fair quantity of false positives. Currently, recommended prevention measures can include type-of-exposure-based respirator protection for persons engaged in agriculture, construction and others working outdoors in endemic areas. Dust control measures such as planting grass and wetting the soil, and also limiting exposure to dust storms are advisable for residential areas in endemic regions.|$|E
25|$|Companies {{that operate}} strong CSR {{activities}} tend to drive customer's attention to buy {{products or services}} regardless of the price. As a result, this increases competition among firms since customers <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company's CSR practices. These initiatives serve as a potential differentiator because they not only add value to the company, {{but also to the}} products or services. Furthermore, firms under intense competition are able to leverage CSR to increase the impact of their distribution on the firm's performance. For instance, lowering the carbon footprint of a firm's distribution network or engaging in fair trade are potential differentiators to lower costs and increase profits. In this scenario, customers can observe the company's commitment to CSR while increasing company sales.|$|E
25|$|In general, we {{absolutely}} condemn {{acts of violence}} and human rights violations committed against individuals in Iraq because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Our training for Iraqi security forces includes instruction on the proper observance of human rights.

And the US embassy in Baghdad has raised, and will continue to raise, the issue with senior officials from the government of Iraq, and has urged them to respond appropriately to all credible reports of violence against gay and lesbian Iraqis.|$|E
