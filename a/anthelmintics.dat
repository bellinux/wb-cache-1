25|$|A serendipitous {{discovery}} {{was made in}} China in the early 1980s while searching for novel <b>anthelmintics</b> for schistosomiasis that artemisinin was effective against schistosomes, the human blood flukes, which are the second-most prevalent parasitic infections, after malaria. Artemisinin and its derivatives are all potent <b>anthelmintics.</b> Artemisinins were later found to possess {{a broad spectrum of}} activity against a wide range of trematodes, including Schistosoma japonicum, S. mansoni, S. haematobium, Clonorchis sinensis, Fasciola hepatica, and Opisthorchis viverrini. Clinical trials were also successfully conducted in Africa among patients with schistosomiasis.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his epidemiological research, Gordon also researched and published extensively {{on the use of}} various <b>anthelmintics</b> in sheep. He was responsible for the discovery in the late 1930s of phenothiazine, a safe and effective anthelmintic. His research showed that this compound could effectively control intestinal parasites in sheep and cattle. This discovery, and local production of the required chemicals, resulted in a massive cut in the economic losses suffered by farmers due to intestinal parasitism. Phenothiazine was the mainstay of internal parasite control in sheep in Australia until the 1960s, when broad-spectrum <b>anthelmintics</b> became available.|$|E
25|$|Other {{important}} {{issues related to}} the treatment of hookworm are reinfection and drug resistance. It has been shown that reinfection after treatment can be extremely high. Some studies even show that 80% of pretreatment hookworm infection rates can be seen in treated communities within 30â€“36 months. While reinfection may occur, it is still recommended that regular treatments be conducted as it will minimize the occurrence of chronic outcomes. There are also increasing concerns about the issue of drug resistance. Drug resistance has appeared in front-line <b>anthelmintics</b> used for livestock nematodes. Generally human nematodes are less likely to develop resistance due to longer reproducing times, less frequent treatment, and more targeted treatment. Nonetheless, the global community must be careful to maintain the effectiveness of current anthelmintic as no new anthelmintic drugs are in the late-stage development.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{drugs are}} {{effective}} for fascioliasis, both in humans and in domestic animals. [...] The {{drug of choice}} {{in the treatment of}} fasciolosis is triclabendazole, a member of the benzimidazole family of <b>anthelmintics.</b> The drug works by preventing the polymerization of the molecule tubulin into the cytoskeletal structures, microtubules. Resistance of F. hepatica to triclabendazole has been recorded in Australia in 1995 and Ireland in 1998.|$|E
2500|$|Hydatidosis {{is caused}} by a cestode Echinococcus. This is usually noticed among dogs, wild dogs, foxes, etc. Due to its {{importance}} as a zoonosis, these worms are important to treat. [...] Preventing hydatidosis is an easier task than treating the same. <b>Anthelmintics</b> such as praziquantel may help prevent this condition. Prohibition of the feeding of dogs with uncooked offals may be the best prophylactic measure against these tapeworms.|$|E

50|$|<b>Anthelmintics</b> or antihelminthics are a {{group of}} {{antiparasitic}} drugs that expel parasitic worms (helminths) and other internal parasites from the body by either stunning or killing them and without causing significant damage to the host. They may also be called vermifuges (those that stun) or vermicides (those that kill). <b>Anthelmintics</b> are used to treat people who are infected by helminths, a condition called helminthiasis. These drugs are also used to treat infected animals.|$|E

50|$|Pills {{containing}} <b>anthelmintics</b> {{are used}} in mass deworming campaigns of school-aged children in many developing countries. For example, the treatment of choice for soil-transmitted helminths is mebendazole and albendazole and praziquantel for schistosomiasis.|$|E
50|$|Imidazothiazoles are bicyclic heterocycles {{consisting}} of an imidazole ring fused to a thiazole ring; any derivative of this compound, especially {{one that is}} any of a class of <b>anthelmintics</b> such as butamisole or levamisole.|$|E
50|$|Derivatives of {{salicylanilide}} have {{a variety}} of pharmacological uses. Chlorinated derivatives including niclosamide, oxyclozanide, and rafoxanide are used as <b>anthelmintics,</b> especially as flukicides.

50|$|In {{a survey}} of West Bengal, India {{undergraduate}} medical school students, 57% reported self-medicating. The type of drugs most frequently used for self-medication were antibiotics (31%), analgesics (23%), antipyretics (18%), antiulcerics (9%), cough suppressants (8%), multivitamins (6%), and <b>anthelmintics</b> (4%).|$|E
50|$|Topical {{treatment}} of livestock, {{dogs and cats}} with organophosphates (such as ecothiopate iodide or isofluorophate) and systemic treatment with <b>anthelmintics</b> (such as ivermectin, levamisole, and doramectin) are recommended by the Merck Veterinary Manual. Other sources have reported positive results treating dogs with moxidectin, imidacloprid, or milbemycin oxime.|$|E
50|$|Infestation {{is easily}} {{diagnosed}} {{by the presence}} of C. aerophila eggs in the nasal or tracheal lavage, or the feces of infested animals. Standard <b>anthelmintics,</b> such as ivermectin or fenbendazole, are recommended for treatment of dogs. Humans infested with C. aerophila have been successfully treated with albendazole and mebendazole.|$|E
50|$|Currently {{there is}} no {{widespread}} use of cysteine proteases as approved and effective <b>anthelmintics</b> but research into the subject is a promising field of study. Plant cysteine proteases isolated from these plants {{have been found to}} have high proteolytic activities that are known to digest nematode cuticles, with very low toxicity. Successful results have been reported against nematodes such as Heligmosomoides bakeri, Trichinella spiralis, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, Trichuris muris, and Ancylostoma ceylanicum; the tapeworm Rodentolepis microstoma, and the porcine acanthocephalan parasite Macracanthorynchus hirundinaceus. A useful property of cysteine proteases is the resistance to acid digestion, allowing possible oral administration. They provide an alternative mechanism of action to current <b>anthelmintics</b> and the development of resistance is thought to be unlikely because it would require a complete change of structure of the helminth cuticle.|$|E
50|$|Human {{infection}} is diagnosed by the parasite {{eggs in the}} faeces. For complicated cysticercosis, imaging techniques such as computed tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance are employed. Blood samples can also be tested using antibody reaction of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Broad-spectrum <b>anthelmintics</b> such as praziquantel and albendazole are the most effective medications.|$|E
50|$|Infection is {{directly}} diagnosed by identifying proglottids in the faeces, or adult worms in the intestine upon autopsy. Broad-spectrum <b>anthelmintics</b> such as albendazole, fenbendazole, praziquantel, oxfendazole and niclosamide are all effective against the different species. The most effective control measure is {{disruption of the}} habitat of intermediate hosts near poultry farms.|$|E
50|$|Asarone, which {{includes}} alpha (trans) and beta (cis) types, is an ether found in certain {{plants such as}} Acorus and Asarum. As a volatile fragrance oil, it is used in killing pests and bacteria. The toxicity and carcinogenicity of asarone means {{that it may be}} difficult to develop practical <b>anthelmintics</b> and insecticides based on it.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a member}} of the {{benzimidazole}} family of <b>anthelmintics.</b> The benzimidazole drugs share a common molecular structure, triclabendazole being the exception in having a chlorinated benzene ring but no carbamate group. Benzimidazoles such as triclabendazole are generally accepted to bind to beta-tubulin and prevent the polymerization of the microtubules of which they are part.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anthelmintics</b> such as {{diethylcarbamazine}} and albendazole {{have shown}} promise {{in the treatment}} of Brugia timori filariasis. Some researchers are confident that Brugia timori filariasis may be an eradicable disease. Related filarial nematodes have been found highly sensitive to elimination of their endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria, and this may be a powerful attack route against Brugia timori as well.|$|E
50|$|Anthelmintic drug {{resistance}} {{is a widespread}} emerging problem. Resistance {{has been reported to}} all broad spectrum <b>anthelmintics,</b> which are benzimidazoles (BZs), levamisole/morantel (LEV) and macrocyclic lactones (ML). There are numbers of reports about resistance of C. oncophora to MLs. MLs include ivermectin (IVM), which has been extensively used to treat livestock gastrointestinal parasites since the 1980s. MLs bind irreversible to Glutmate gated chloride ion (GluCl) channels, leading to hyperpolarisation. Pharyngeal and somatic muscle cells get paralyzed, which results in starvation of the worms and also their removal from the gastrointestinal tract. Broad spectrum <b>anthelmintics</b> include benzimidazoles (BZs). BZs have been used since the 1960s, and resistance was detected in sheep shortly after commercialization of the first drug, called thiabendazole, in 1964. Reason for emerging resistance is selection for resistant individuals, particularly by high treatment frequency and under-dosing of the drugs. Other nematodes such as H. contortus are more susceptible to the drugs, which leads to a shift in the nemabiome towards higher relative amount of C. oncophora.|$|E
50|$|CWW {{oversees the}} {{donation}} of <b>anthelmintics</b> to the Ministries of Health and Education in eight recipient countries, including Bangladesh, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Lao PDR, Nicaragua, Uganda and Zambia. The annual donation consists of 200 million tablets of mebendazole from Johnson & Johnson, and 400 million tablets of albendazole from GlaxoSmithKline, {{and these are}} estimated {{for the treatment of}} up to 300 million children twice a year.|$|E
50|$|Broad {{spectrum}} <b>anthelmintics</b> {{are also}} effective against adult worms and larvae. There are several benzimidazoles {{were successful in}} clearing infection, including albendazole, febantel, fenbendazole, oxfendazole. Moreover, levamisole and several macrocyclic lactones (e.g. abamectin, doramectin, eprinomectin, ivermectin, moxidectin) are reported to be effective. After multiple rounds of exposure adult ruminants can overcome the adverse effects of the parasite however still it act as reservoir for new infection.|$|E
