Why suffer what humans have suffered, the pain and despair—what meaning can all of this have? For Kierkegaard, there is no meaning unless passion, the emotions and will of humans, has a divine source.|$|E
25|$|Discovering Britain is {{a website}} {{featuring}} {{a series of}} self-led geographical walks that help explain the stories behind the UK's built and natural landscapes. Each walk explores a particular landscape, finding out about {{the way in which}} the forces of nature, people, events and the economy have created and shaped the area. There are now more than 120 walks on the Discovering Britain website, covering all regions of the United Kingdom. Walks are themed according to the landscape in which they are located, including built, prehistoric, historic, working, hidden and changing landscapes. Walks <b>also</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> people in the landscape, and shaping, preserving and exploiting the landscape.|$|E
25|$|The term Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC) {{was coined}} by Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s to refer more {{generally}} to communication through {{any sort of}} electronic device such as tape recorders, fax machines, television sets or computers between spirits or other discarnate entities and the living. One particularly famous claimed incidence of ITC occurred when the image of EVP enthusiast Friedrich Jürgenson (whose funeral was held that day) {{was said to have}} appeared on a television in the home of a colleague, which had been purposefully tuned to a vacant channel.

500|$|Senior writer Maurice Hurley {{left at the}} end {{of season}} two, and Michael I. Wagner was brought onto the show by {{executive}} producer Rick Berman. Wagner's tenure was brief, lasting three weeks, and he recommended Michael Piller to replace him. Wagner and Piller had previously worked together on the 1988 American television series Probe. Piller's agent had advised him not to join Star Trek as he would be [...] "pigeon-holed as a freelance writer", but he ignored the advice. He would <b>also</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> leaving {{at the end of}} the season, but stayed after Berman and show creator Gene Roddenberry convinced him. Piller wrote the episode that opened the season, [...] "" [...] and took over as executive producer from [...] "The Bonding" [...] onwards. He explained to the writing staff that there was two requirements for every episode, saying that [...] "every episode is going to be about a character's growth. And every episode has to be about something." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{an article}} in The Christian Science Monitor, Vassar {{president}} Catharine Bond Hill argued that rankings [...] "will always be limited in what they can tell consumers. Part of higher education's role about the rankings should be to remind {{students and their families}} that these are only one piece of information that they should take into account in deciding where to go to college. Intangibles will and should play a role in these decisions, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't <b>also</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the tangibles".|$|E

60|$|Nasmyth fancied that he {{must have}} gone to sleep soon after this, for when he opened his eyes again {{there was no sign of}} the doctor, and a girl was quietly moving about the room. She sat down, when she saw that he was awake, and looked at him with a little smile, and it was only natural that Nasmyth should <b>also</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her. It struck him once more that she had {{wonderful}} hair. In the lamp-light, it seemed to glow with curious red-gold gleams. She had also quiet brown eyes, and a face that was a trifle darkened by sun and wind. He guessed that she was tall. She looked so as she moved about the room with a supple gracefulness that had a suggestion of strength in it. That was all he noticed in detail, for he was chiefly conscious of the air of quiet composure that characterized her. He was a trifle fanciful that night, and, while he looked her, he felt as he had sometimes felt when he stood at sunset in the silence of the shadowy Bush, or gazed down into the depths of some still river pool. Only her gleaming red-gold hair and her full red lips slightly counteracted this impression. There was in them at least a hint of fire and passion.|$|E

60|$|The {{pleasure}} {{with which}} I {{look at the}} splendor of an Italian crowd in winter is always touched with melancholy. I know that, {{at the time of}} its noonday promenade, it has nothing but a cup of coffee in its stomach; that it has emerged from a house as cold and dim as a cellar; and that it will presently go home to dine on rice and boiled beef. I know that chilblains secretly gnaw the hands inside of its kid gloves, and I see in the rawness of its faces the anguish of winter-long suffering from cold. But I <b>also</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> many in this crowd with the eye of the economist, and wonder how people practicing even so great self-denial as they can contrive to make so much display on their little means,--how those clerks of public offices, who have rarely an income of five hundred dollars a year, can dress with such peerless gorgeousness. I suppose the national instinct teaches them ways and means unknown to us. The passion for dress is universal: the men are as fond of it as the women; and, happily, clothes are comparatively cheap. It is no great harm in itself, this display: it is only a pity that there is often nothing, or worse than nothing, under the shining surface.|$|E
60|$|From {{that hour}} Mr. Freely felt sure of success: being in privacy with an estimable man {{old enough to}} be his father, and being rather lonely in the world, it was natural he should unbosom himself a little on {{subjects}} which he could not speak of in a mixed circle--especially concerning his expectations from his uncle in Jamaica, who had no children, and loved his nephew Edward better than any one else in the world, though he had been so hurt at his leaving Jamaica, that he had threatened to cut him off with a shilling. However, he had since written to state his full forgiveness, and though he was an eccentric old gentleman and could not bear to give away money during his life, Mr. Edward Freely could show Mr. Palfrey the letter which declared, plainly enough, who would be the affectionate uncle's heir. Mr. Palfrey actually saw the letter, and could not help admiring the spirit of the nephew who declared that such brilliant hopes as these made no difference to his conduct; he should work at his humble business and make his modest fortune at it all the same. If the Jamaica estate was to come to him--well and good. It was nothing very surprising for one of the Freely family to have an estate left him, considering the lands that family had possessed in time gone by--nay, still possessed in the Northumberland branch. Would not Mr. Palfrey take another glass of rum? and <b>also</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the last year's balance of the accounts? Mr. Freely was a man who cared to possess personal virtues, and did not pique himself on his family, though some men would.|$|E
