40|$|This paper {{indicates}} causality as {{the tool}} that unifies {{the analysis of}} both <b>activations</b> and connectivity of brain areas, obtained with fMRI data. Causality analysis is commonly applied to study connectivity, so this work focuses on demonstrating that also the detection of <b>activations</b> can be handled with a causality analysis. We test our method on finger tapping data, in which GLM and Granger Causality approaches are compared in finding <b>activations.</b> Granger causality not only performs the task well, but indeed we obtained a better localization (i. e. precision) of <b>activations.</b> As a result we claim that causality must be the main tool to investigate <b>activations,</b> since it {{is a measure of}} "how much" the stimulus influences the BOLD signal, and since it unifies connectivity and <b>activations</b> analysis under the same area...|$|R
5|$|Many {{language}} studies, {{particularly in}} fMRI, use the subtraction paradigm, in which brain <b>activation</b> in a task thought to involve {{some aspect of}} language processing is compared against <b>activation</b> in a baseline task thought to involve similar non-linguistic processes but not to involve the linguistic process. For example, activations while participants read words may be compared to baseline activations while participants read strings of random letters (in attempt to isolate <b>activation</b> related to lexical processingthe processing of real words), or activations while participants read syntactically complex sentences may be compared to baseline activations while participants read simpler sentences.|$|E
5|$|The initial Windows {{release was}} criticized by players for several {{perceived}} shortcomings. The game was shipped with SecuROM copy protection that required <b>activation</b> from 2K Games' servers over the Internet; the unavailability of these servers was reported {{as the reason}} for the cancellation of the game's midnight release in Australia. Players found that the SecuROM limited the number of times the game could be activated to two; user feedback led to 2K Games to increase the <b>activation</b> count to five, and later offer a tool that allowed users to revoke previous activations on their own. Ultimately 2K Games removed the <b>activation</b> limit, though retail versions of the game still required the <b>activation</b> process. Levine admitted that their initial approach to the <b>activation</b> process was malformed, harming their reputation during the launch period.|$|E
5|$|While {{induction}} {{entails the}} transient <b>activation</b> of CaMKII and PKC, maintenance of E-LTP (early-form LTP) {{is characterized by}} their persistent <b>activation.</b> During this stage, PKMz (Protein kinase Mζ) which does not have dependence on calcium, become autonomously active. Consequently, {{they are able to}} carry out the phosphorylation events that underlie E-LTP expression.|$|E
30|$|POPCO {{networks}} usually {{settle into}} a stable state in which <b>activations</b> fluctuate very little, after about 30 – 200 settling iterations, i.e. 6 – 40 passes through the main loop. (Since {{the course of a}} real person’s thought processes needn’t come to a stable resolution before being interrupted by input from others, POPCO networks shouldn’t have to settle before communication modifies the networks.) The pattern of <b>activations</b> in each network then represents a (perhaps locally) optimal configuration that balances <b>activations</b> in response to weights between connected nodes. A “good” network configuration is one in which pairs of positively-linked nodes usually have <b>activations</b> with the same sign, while negatively-linked nodes usually have <b>activations</b> with opposite signs.|$|R
30|$|It was {{possible}} to demonstrate <b>activations</b> in auditory brain regions during general anesthesia; however, the frequency and markedness of positive findings were dependent {{on some of the}} abovementioned influence factors. Scan duration (60 vs. 90  s) had no significant influence on peak height of auditory cortex <b>activations.</b> To achieve a similar frequency and extent of AR <b>activations</b> during general anesthesia compared to waking state, a lower cut-off for statistical inferences (p[*]<[*] 0.05 or p[*]<[*] 0.01 vs. p[*]<[*] 0.001) had to be applied. However, this lower cut-off was frequently associated with unexpected, “artificial” <b>activations</b> in eAR. These <b>activations</b> in eAR could be slightly reduced by the use of a stronger smoothing filter kernel during preprocessing of the data (e.g., [30  mm] 3).|$|R

25|$|It {{is unknown}} what role the {{relatively}} bulky extracellular region of CD45 plays during cell interactions, but CD45 has various isoforms that change in size {{depending on the}} Th cell's <b>activation</b> and maturation status. For example, CD45 shortens in length following Th <b>activation</b> (CD45RA+ to CD45RO+), but whether this change in length influences <b>activation</b> is unknown. It has been proposed that the larger CD45RA+ may decrease the accessibility of the T cell receptor for the antigen-MHC molecule, thereby necessitating {{an increase in the}} affinity (and specificity) of the T cell for <b>activation.</b> Once the <b>activation</b> has occurred however, CD45 shortens, allowing easier interactions and <b>activation</b> as an effector T helper cell.|$|E

Similarities of <b>activation</b> have been found in Broca's area and semantic retrieval causes similar patterns of <b>activation</b> in the anterior left inferior frontal lobe.

40|$|International audienceHow {{does the}} human visual system {{accommodate}} expertise for two simultaneously acquired symbolic systems? We used fMRI to compare <b>activations</b> induced {{in the visual}} cortex by musical notation, written words and other classes of objects, in professional musicians and in musically naïve controls. First, irrespective of expertise, selective <b>activations</b> for music were posterior and lateral to <b>activations</b> for words in the left occipitotemporal cortex. This indicates that symbols characterized by different visual features engage distinct cortical areas. Second, musical expertise increased the volume of <b>activations</b> for music and led to an anterolateral displacement of word-related <b>activations.</b> In musicians, {{there was also a}} dramatic increase of the brain-scale networks connected to the music-selective visual areas. Those findings reveal that acquiring a double visual expertise involves an expansion of category-selective areas, the development of novel long-distance functional connectivity, and possibly some competition between categories for the colonization of cortical space...|$|R

40|$|Deep {{convolutional}} {{neural networks}} (CNN) have shown their promise {{as a universal}} representation for recognition. However, global CNN <b>activations</b> lack geometric invariance, which limits their robustness for classification and matching of highly variable scenes. To improve the invariance of CNN <b>activations</b> without degrading their discriminative power, this paper presents a simple but effective scheme called multi-scale orderless pooling (MOP-CNN). This scheme extracts CNN <b>activations</b> for local patches at multiple scale levels, performs orderless VLAD pooling of these <b>activations</b> at each level separately, and concatenates the result. The resulting MOP-CNN representation {{can be used as}} a generic feature for either supervised or unsupervised recognition tasks, from image classification to instance-level retrieval; it consistently outperforms global CNN <b>activations</b> without requiring any joint training of prediction layers for a particular target dataset. In absolute terms, it achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging SUN 397 and MIT Indoor Scenes classification datasets, and competitive results on ILSVRC 2012 / 2013 classification and INRIA Holidays retrieval datasets...|$|R
