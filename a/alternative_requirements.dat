In formulating requirements for new systems, analysts face difficult tasks of selecting between <b>alternative</b> <b>requirement</b> decompositions, identifying questionable or low-priority requirements, eliminating requirements that add unnecessary costs, projecting cost impact of the requirements and then evaluating alternative system design proposals against the stated requirements. We seek approaches that require modest investments of time and can be applied even at {{the early stages of}} the requirements formulation process. We show that the Analytical Hierarchy Process can be applied to provide such evaluation mechanisms and illustrate our approach with a detailed example...|$|R
40|$|We {{outline the}} need for stricter {{requirements}} for unconditionally secure cryptographic protocols inspired by the Russian Cards problem. A new requirement CA 4 is proposed that checks for bias in single card occurrence in announcements consisting of alternatives for players' holdings of cards. This requirement CA 4 is shown to be equivalent to an <b>alternative</b> <b>requirement</b> CA 5. All announcements found to satisfy CA 4 are 2 -designs. We also show that all binary designs are 3 -designs. Instead of avoiding bias in announcements produced by such protocols, one may as well apply unbiased protocols such that patterns in announcements become meaningless. We gave two examples of such protocols for card deal parameters (3, 3, 1), i. e. two of the players hold three cards, and the remaining player, {{playing the role of}} eavesdropper, holds a single card.

40|$|John McDowell and Bill Brewer famously {{defend the}} view that one can only have {{empirical}} beliefs if one’s perceptual experiences serve as reasons for such beliefs, where reasons are {{understood in terms of}} subject’s reasons.

But we have strong reasons to think that 3 -year-old children have empirical beliefs, or so I argue. If this is the case, McDowell and Brewer’s requirement for one to have empirical beliefs faces a strong challenge.

Design traceability in such settings must be both product-oriented and process-oriented: it must enable an efficient media-based comparison of product alternatives from the current project or related experiences, and it must facilitate reuse of modeling experiences to avoid unnecessary repetition of negative experiences. We have studied these problems in a large interdisciplinary project whose aim it is to optimize supply chains linking chemical engineering, plastics engineering, and related application demands e. g. in the automotive industry.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the debate {{as to whether}} something can have final value in virtue of its relational (i. e., non-intrinsic) properties, or, more briefly put, whether final value must be intrinsic. The paper adopts {{the perspective of the}} fitting-attitude analysis (FA analysis) of value, and argues that from this perspective, there is no ground for the requirement that things may have final value only in virtue of their intrinsic properties, but that there might be some grounds for the alternate requirement that final value be grounded only in the essential properties of their bearers. First, the paper introduces the key elements of the FA analysis, and sets aside an obvious but unimportant way in which this analysis makes all final values relational. Second, it discusses some classical counterexamples to the view that final value must be intrinsic. Third, it discusses the relation between final, contributive, and signatory value. Fourth, it examines Zimmerman’s defense of the requirement that final value must be intrinsic on the grounds that final value cannot be derivative. And finally, it explores the <b>alternative</b> <b>requirement</b> that something may have final value in virtue of its essential properties...|$|R

40|$|Software {{systems are}} {{becoming}} {{an integral part}} of everyday life influencing organizational and social activities. This aggravates the need for a socio-technical perspective for requirements engineering, which allows for modelling and analyzing the composition and interaction of hardware and software components with human and organizational actors. In this setting, <b>alternative</b> <b>requirements</b> models have to be evaluated and selected finding a right trade-off between the technical and social dimensions. To address this problem, we propose a tool-supported process of requirements analysis for socio-technical systems, which adopts planning techniques for exploring the space of requirements alternatives and a number of social criteria for their evaluation.

40|$|Abstract. Software {{systems are}} {{becoming}} more and more part of hu-man life influencing organizational and social activities. This introduces the need of considering the design of a software system as an integral part of the organizational and social structure development. <b>Alternative</b> <b>requirements</b> and design models have to be evaluated and selected from a social perspective finding a right trade-off between the technical and social dimension. In this paper, we present a Tropos-based approach for requirements analysis, which adopts planning techniques for exploring the space of requirements alternatives and a number of social criteria for their evaluation. We describe the tool-supported analysis process with the help of a case study (the e-voting system), which is a part of a project funded by the Autonomous Province of Trento. ...|$|E
