25|$|Towards {{the back}} of the museum is a large modern {{extension}} designed by the architects Anna Maria Indrio and Mads Møller from Arkitektfirmaet C. F. Møller. The extension was erected in 1998 to house the extensive modern art collection. The two buildings are connected by a glass panelled 'Street of Sculptures' walkway and theatre which stretches {{the entire length of the}} museum <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> onto the Østre Anlæg park. Talks, concerts and installations are all held in this area.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{bedrooms}} {{and a small}} kitchenette upstairs. The master bedroom, where Mr. and Mrs. Adamson slept, is on {{the southwest corner of}} the house. It has a large tiled bathroom, and Mrs. Adamson's clothes and hat collection remain in her closet. Next to the master bedroom is the one designed for the Adamsons' son; its bathroom has detailed tiles depicting ships and nautical scenes. The girls' bedroom in the center facing the ocean has a tremendous view of the ocean and coast. These three bedrooms open onto a large upstairs patio with the home's most spectacular panoramic view of the ocean, the Malibu lagoon and the coast in both directions. The fourth bedroom upstairs is at the eastern end of the second floor <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> of a large Dombeya tree that blooms with spectacular bright red flowers in the spring.|$|E

500|$|The video {{starts with}} a news anchor (played by Kristina Mitchell) saying {{the title of the}} song above a news banner that reads [...] "Britney Spears song lyrics spell out {{obscenity}} in disguise". This is a parody of an America's Newsroom report by Megyn Kelly. It then skips to a house, in which a sex party is coming to an end. Spears starts singing while {{sitting on the edge of}} a bed while the people that surround her are getting dressed. She gets up <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> the window. As the first verse ends, she picks up a pair of panties from the floor, recalling her personal struggles and the [...] "Piece of Me" [...] video. She dances with four male dancers in the first chorus. During the second chorus, she dances with four other female dancers dressed in cheerleading outfits, while many men are watching them dance. The screen fades to white and Spears begins to change into a conservative '50s-inspired housewife outfit. As the chorus begins again, she comes out of her bedroom. She walks down the stairs, with dancers surrounding her and a woman gives her a potholder, which she uses to pick up a pie. After this, she walks out the front door of the house and is joined by her seemingly conservative-looking husband and children, one of them dressed with the schoolgirl outfit Spears wore in the [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] video. As they go down the walkway, they are surrounded by paparazzi, who have no idea what goes on behind closed doors. While the kids and husband wave, Spears smiles for the camera and blows a kiss. The video then ends with the news anchor saying, [...] "Doesn't make any sense, does it?".|$|E
2500|$|INAH {{completed}} a {{restoration of the}} building in 2007. It is relatively short, only [...] high, and is [...] in length and [...] wide. The long, western-facing façade has seven doorways. The eastern façade has only four doorways, broken by a large staircase {{that leads to the}} roof. This apparently was the front of the structure, <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> over what is today a steep, dry, cenote.|$|E

This {{part of the}} lake also borders {{the entrance to the}} Broads, the largest open area in the lake. Winter Harbor is surrounded by many quiet resort communities in the towns of Wolfeboro and Tuftonboro. A small stream connects Winter Harbor to Mirror Lake at the northern tip of the western branch. It also has panoramic views of the Belnap mountains <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> toward Rattle Snake Island.|$|E
2500|$|In 1952, Douglas Seale {{directed}} {{a production of}} 3 Henry VI at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, following a successful production of 2 Henry VI in 1951. 1 Henry VI would follow in 1953. All three plays starred Paul Daneman as Henry and Rosalind Boxall as Margaret, with 3 Henry VI featuring Alan Bridges as Edward and Edgar Wreford as Richard. Although little {{was removed from the}} text, it did end differently from the written play. After Edward has spoken his last lines, everyone leaves the stage except Richard, who walks towards the throne, then turns <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> to the audience, speaking the first thirty lines of his opening speech from Richard III (from [...] "Now is the winter of our discontent" [...] to [...] "I am determin'd to prove a villain"), at which point the curtain falls. Additionally, in this production, Boxall as Margaret fully participated in the Battle of Tewkesbury, which was considered a bold move at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Rebecca is {{disgusted with}} Paul and throws {{him out of}} their home. To win her back, Paul gives up working at Lassiter's {{for six months and}} places Declan in charge. Declan and Diana join forces to bring down Paul and Rosemary. However, Andrew helps Paul uncover their plan in time. Paul then informs Diana that she has been sacked and he threatens Declan, who tells Rebecca. Sonya Mitchell confronts Paul and he insults her. Andrew {{believes}} that Paul will give him Declan's job, but Paul refuses to. When he learns Andrew tried to access his will, Paul tells his son that he will have him removed from it. Andrew wishes his father dead. Diana contacts Jack Ward (Peter Lowrey) and asks him to [...] "take care of Paul", before telling Rebecca about their affair. A devastated Rebecca heads to Lassiter's to see Paul and Declan follows her. Paul goes to the hotel's mezzanine <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> across the complex, while thinking about recent events. An unseen person arrives at the hotel and goes up to the roof. Paul recognises the person and greets them, before he is pushed through the glass wall of the mezzanine. Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) and Toadie attend to Paul, who has head injuries, broken ribs and a broken arm. Seconds later, Declan and Rebecca rush out of the hotel.|$|E
