Munroe has said that the volume of questions has been high enough {{that it is impossible to}} read all of them. Answering a question and writing a post takes him about a day of solid work.|$|E

5|$|It {{appears that}} {{predation}} by invasive mammalian species including ship rats, cats, and mustelids was an additional {{factor in the}} decline in huia numbers – introduction of these animals by New Zealand acclimatisation societies peaked in the 1880s and coincided with a particularly sharp decline in huia populations. Because it spent <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> on the ground, the huia would have been particularly vulnerable to mammalian predators. Another hypothetical cause of extinction is exotic parasites and disease introduced from Asia with the common myna.|$|E

The team also realized that players spent <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> interacting with the open world of Far Cry 3, and decided to put more effort and resources into the world's design and add more quests to the game.|$|E
