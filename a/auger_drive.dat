These are commonly used as guy anchors for utility poles since they are quick to install with a truck mounted hydraulic powered <b>auger</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E

50|$|Handheld drain augers are {{typically}} designed to clean portions of a drain within 8 metres (25 ft) of the drain opening. The cable of a handheld drain <b>auger</b> is <b>driven</b> into a drain by the mechanical force created when the operator rotates a drum that anchors the cable.|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} ways to place piles for a deep foundation. They can be driven, drilled, or {{installed}} {{by use of}} an <b>auger.</b> <b>Driven</b> piles are extended to their necessary depths with the application of external energy {{in the same way}} a nail is hammered. There are four typical hammers used to drive such piles: drop hammers, diesel hammers, hydraulic hammers, and air hammers. Drop hammers simply drop a heavy weight onto the pile to drive it, while diesel hammers use a single cylinder diesel engine to force piles through the Earth. Similarly, hydraulic and air hammers supply energy to piles through hydraulic and air forces. Energy imparted from a hammer head varies with type of hammer chosen, and can be as high as a million foot pounds for large scale diesel hammers, a very common hammer head used in practice. Piles are made of a variety of material including steel, timber, and concrete. Drilled piles are created by first drilling a hole to the appropriate depth, and filling it with concrete. Drilled piles can typically carry more load than driven piles, simply due to a larger diameter pile. The auger method of pile installation is similar to drilled pile installation, but concrete is pumped into the hole as the auger is being removed.|$|R
50|$|The term feeding in {{the context}} of vacuum fillers refers to {{actively}} moving the filling media {{in the direction of the}} lower part of the hopper to support the vacuum approach within the hopper. Feeding is achieved by using moveable feeding augers with scrapers/rigid counter arms. The feeding <b>auger</b> is <b>driven</b> in synchronisation with the rotation of the rotors. Due to the special geometry of both augers and the parallel rotation movement, the filling product is moved vertically in the direction of the vane cell feed system. The required feed intensity depends on the viscosity of the media to be filled. Less active feed is needed with low-viscosity media than with high-viscosity product. There are therefore a variety of combinations or versions of the parts involved in the feeding process.|$|R
30|$|Soil {{sampling}} {{was undertaken}} in February 2012. In {{each of the}} CP plots, a 25 -m square was marked out. These were then divided into 25 grid nodes of 5  m[*]×[*] 5  m and each was allocated a number (1 to 25). To select the nodes for soil coring, five numbered cards were randomly drawn from a bag. At each of the selected grid nodes, five deep soil cores were extracted to 0.4  m depth using a 0.1 -m-diameter hydraulically <b>driven</b> <b>auger.</b> Due to the impracticability of setting up 25 -m square plots in the BR and RR plots, five soil cores were extracted at 5 -m intervals along a 25  m strip within each plot.|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{evidence}} on load-settlement behaviour of foundation piles in the volcanic soils of Naples area is presented and discussed. The variability of behaviour among piles {{of the same}} foundation seems independent of the pile technology (bored, <b>driven,</b> <b>auger</b> piles). The behaviour of auger piles is generally intermediate between those of bored and driven piles; {{the results of a}} number of proof load tests, performed on piles belonging to two recent auger pile foundations, confirm this finding. Eventually, the results of load tests carried out up to failure on large diameter bored piles, equipped with a preloading cell at the base and instrumented along the shaft by means of strain gages extensometers, are presented...|$|R
40|$|A lunar outpost {{will have}} need for deep {{drilling}} operations for both explorative and practical purposes. As in any drilling operation, the cuttings must be cleared from the hole. The hard vacuum of the lunar environment renders conventional flushing methods of cutting removal unfeasible, and requires {{a new system of}} removal. A rotary stepped auger (RSA) is a simple mechanical method of removing dry cuttings from a deep hole, and is ideally suited to the lunar environment. The RSA consists of a helical auger with stepped ramps which allow cuttings to slide up the helix, but will prevent them from sliding back down. The <b>auger</b> is <b>driven</b> in a pulsed manner by applying a periodic function of acceleration to the auger shaft. These pulses will compel the cuttings to slide up the auger's helix while the stepped ramps prevent the cuttings from backsliding while the auger accelerates. A mathematical model of the RSA was developed and experimentally evaluated. The math model produced a good baseline design, but the experimental model required some tuning to account for the approximations made in the math model. This design is suited for lunar drilling because it is mechanically simple, integral to the drill string, requires no fluids, is suited to the dry soil, and has relatively low weight and power requirements...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{experiments}} on dicing monocrystalline silicon wafer using micro abrasive water jet turning were performed. A specifically designed water jet machine tool with four axes {{was developed and}} a specially designed cutting head has developed, in which the inside diameter of orifice and focusing tube is φ 125 µm and φ 500 µm respectively, while the silicon carbide solid abrasives with average diameter of 25 - 100 µm was used. In order to control the flow rate of micro abrasives precisely, an abrasive feed system with <b>auger</b> mechanism <b>driven</b> by DC motor reducer was used. The diameters of monocrystalline silicon bars are around 50 mm. Two basic turning methods, i. e. turning with stationary jet and turning with moving jet were applied. The preliminary experimental results such as kerf width, wafer thickness, surface quality etc. were analyzed. It was found that micro abrasive water jet {{can be used to}} precisely turn brittle materials like monocrystalline silicon. The turned wafer with thickness of 1 mm above could be achieved. A thinner wafer less than 1 mm is difficult to obtain during experiments because of cracking or chipping. Experiments demonstrate that the wafer surface has macro stripping characteristics similar to linear cutting. It was observed that there is less waviness and smooth surface on the turned wafer when with moving jet. And it depends greatly on the water jet pressure, feed rate of the jet, rotation speed of silicon bar, abrasive particle siz...|$|R
