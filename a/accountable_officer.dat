5000|$|The Nuffield Trust {{think tank}} claims many {{suggestions}} would fail to implement government financial targets and involve a [...] "dauntingly large implementation task". Sally Gainsbury of the Nuffield Trust said many current plans involve shifting or closing services... "Our research finds that, {{in a lot}} of these kinds of reconfigurations, you don't save very much money - all that happens is the patient has to go to the next hospital down the road. They're more inconvenienced... but it rarely saves the money that's needed." [...] There will be a shift from inpatient to outpatient care but critics fear cuts that could put lives at risk, that the plans dismantle the health service rather than protecting it, further that untested plans put less mobile, vulnerable people at risk. By contrast, NHS England claims that the plans bring joined-up care closer to home. John Lister of Keep Our NHS Public said there are too many assumptions, and managers desperate to cut deficits were resorting to untried plans. [...] A survey of ninety-nine clinical commissioning group chairs and <b>accountable</b> <b>officers</b> conducted by the Health Service Journal in October 2016 found very little confidence that the plans would deliver.|$|R
40|$|Increasingly, {{government}} departments {{are being held}} accountable for investment in public services. In Queensland the Financial Accountability Act 2009 (Queensland Treasury, 2016) requires that <b>accountable</b> <b>officers</b> and statutory bodies ‘achieve reasonable value for money by ensuring the operations of the department or statutory body are carried out efficiently, effectively and economically’ (Section 61). Whilst there is a directive for agencies to evaluate and demonstrate value for money, it has in practice been difficult to embed long term, as many systems and decision makers have neglected the role of organisation-wide evaluation capital. This paper will outline the work being undertaken in the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (DAF) to implement an Impact and Investment Framework, which will support and embed evaluation in a multidisciplinary setting. A central tenant of this framework is ‘business empowerment and learning’— building the evaluation culture in the organisation by first establishing evaluation building blocks, through business empowerment, support and utility. The framework is comprised of five key elements and is built on the principles of evaluation and evaluation capacity building disciplines. It has been designed to be low-cost, effective and efficient, whilst enabling business improvement, meeting accountability needs and allowing the Department to demonstrate the value of its work...|$|R

40|$|The {{best way}} to provide The Effectiveness of the Internal Control System, Risk Management Strategy and Staff Code of Conduct of One of Malaysia’s Biggest Commercial Banks in Minimizing Fraud is the {{employees}} need understand the guidelines and procedures provided by banking industry. The internal control system includes all the policies and procedures established by management to achieve three objectives: reliability of the financial reports, operating efficiency and effectiveness, and compliance with laws and regulations. The Financial Accountability Act 2009 requires all <b>accountable</b> <b>officers</b> and statutory bodies {{to establish and maintain}} appropriate systems of internal control and risk management. Risk management focuses on adopting a systematic and consistent approach to manage all of the risks confronting an organization The objective of this thesis is to understand method implemented by Bank to minimizing fraud activities. The risk management function bears some of the responsibility to develop an appropriate risk aware culture within organization. This goes beyond defining and monitoring the elements of culture, determining new initiatives and directions intended to promote the desired characteristics of the culture. It {{has to do with the}} risk management area’s own behaviours. Those within risk management department, particularly in technical and financial industries, will be strong technicians. Training has been largely technical, and the rewarded behaviours have been largely technically orientated. However, communication and even marketing skills are also important attributes rational and input to business decisions. The regulation by Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance (2012) and Financial Services Act (2013) is inclusive to minimize the fraud among banking staff. The rule and principle is direction to staff understand the method and the {{best way to}} avoid fraud in banking industry...|$|R

5000|$|Each CCG has a {{constitution}} and {{is run by}} its governing body. Each has to have an <b>accountable</b> <b>officer</b> responsible for the CCG’s duties, functions, finance and governance.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} concept of Officers of Parliament and {{their place in the}} much older concept of {{responsible}} government. It argues that the changing nature of responsible government allows a place for Officers of Parliament to assist Parliament in holding government <b>accountable.</b> Since <b>Officers</b> of Parliament act as a check on government, it is necessary for the Officers to be independent from government. This thesis argues that independence is one of the defining characteristics of the Officers. Finally, by examining the relationship of Officers of Parliament with both the Senate and the House of Commons it is possible to see how Officers of Parliament fit into the complex structure of parliamentary government. This examination illustrates how the Houses of Parliament relate to their Officers as well as to each other...|$|R
