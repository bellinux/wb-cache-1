5|$|The <b>allergenic</b> {{potential}} of red maples varies widely {{based on the}} cultivar.|$|E
5|$|Mup {{genes from}} other mammals also encode <b>allergenic</b> proteins, for example Feld4 is {{primarily}} {{produced in the}} submandibular salivary gland and is deposited onto dander as the cat grooms itself. A study found that 63% of cat allergic people have antibodies against the protein. Most had higher titres of antibodies against Feld4 than against Feld1, another prominent cat allergen. Likewise, Equc1 (Equus caballus allergen 1) is the protein product of a horse Mup gene that {{is found in the}} liver, sublingual and submaxillary salivary glands. It is responsible for about 80% of the antibody response in patients who are chronically exposed to horse allergens.|$|E
5|$|The pygmy slow loris {{produces}} an apocrine secretion on scent glands near their elbow (brachial glands). This clear liquid, when mixed with its saliva, creates a volatile, noxious toxin. When startled, the slow loris licks its brachial glands and applies the secretion to its heads. The oily secretion contains a complex mixture of volatile and semi-volatile components; one chemical analysis indicated over 200 components were present. One {{of the components}} {{is a member of}} the secretoglobin family of proteins, and similar to an <b>allergenic</b> protein found in cat dander. The similarity between the brachial gland secretions and domestic cat allergens may account for anaphylaxis in susceptible individuals.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} members of the lipocalin protein family, major urinary {{proteins}} can be potent allergens to humans. The reason for this is not known, however molecular mimicry between Mups and structurally similar human lipocalins has been proposed as a possible explanation. The protein product of the mouse Mup17 gene, known as Musm1, Ag1 or MA1, accounts for much of the <b>allergenic</b> properties of mouse urine. The protein is extremely stable in the environment; studies have found 95% of inner city homes, and 82% of all types of homes in the United States have detectable levels in at least one room. Similarly, Ratn1 is a known human allergen. A US study found its presence in 33% of inner city homes, and 21% of occupants were sensitized to the allergen. Exposure and sensitization to rodent Mup proteins is considered a risk factor for childhood asthma, and is a leading cause of laboratory animal allergy (LAA)—an occupational disease of laboratory animal technicians and scientists. One study found that two-thirds of laboratory workers who had developed asthmatic reactions to animals had antibodies to Ratn1.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt-based {{superalloys}} consume {{most of the}} produced cobalt. The {{temperature stability}} of these alloys makes them suitable for turbine blades for gas turbines and jet aircraft engines, though nickel-based single crystal alloys surpass them in performance. Cobalt-based alloys are also corrosion and wear-resistant, making them (along with titanium) useful in medical orthopedic implants that do not wear down over time. The development of wear-resistant cobalt alloys started {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century with the stellite alloys, containing chromium with varying quantities of tungsten and carbon. Alloys with chromium and tungsten carbides are very hard and wear resistant. Special cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys like Vitallium are used for prosthetic parts (hip and knee replacements). Cobalt alloys are also used for dental prosthetics as a useful substitute for nickel, which may be <b>allergenic.</b> Some high speed steels also contain cobalt for increased heat and wear-resistance. The special alloys of aluminium, nickel, cobalt and iron, known as Alnico, and of samarium and cobalt (samarium-cobalt magnet) are used in permanent magnets. It is also alloyed with 95% platinum for jewelry, yielding an alloy suitable for fine casting and is also slightly magnetic.|$|E
25|$|The major <b>allergenic</b> {{compound}} in the pollen {{has been identified}} as Amb a 1, a 38kDa nonglycosylated protein composed of two subunits. It also contains other <b>allergenic</b> components, such as profilin and calcium-binding proteins.|$|E
25|$|The predators of dust mites {{are other}} <b>allergenic</b> mites (Cheyletus), Silverfish and pseudoscorpions.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} {{varieties}} of mold that contain toxic compounds (mycotoxins). However, exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation {{is not possible}} in most cases, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the released spores. The primary hazard of mold growth, {{as it relates to}} indoor air quality, comes from the <b>allergenic</b> properties of the spore cell wall. More serious than most <b>allergenic</b> properties is the ability of mold to trigger episodes in persons that already have asthma, a serious respiratory disease.|$|E
25|$|The Food Allergy Resource and Research Program of the University of Nebraska {{undertook}} {{research in}} 2006 {{that showed the}} proteins from the new genes in golden rice showed no <b>allergenic</b> properties.|$|E
25|$|The {{disadvantage}} of male Ginkgo biloba trees {{is that they}} are highly <b>allergenic.</b> Male Ginkgo biloba trees have an OPALS allergy scale rating of 7 (out of 10), whereas female trees, which can produce no pollen, have an OPALS allergy scale rating of 2.|$|E
25|$|MIT is <b>allergenic</b> and cytotoxic, {{and this}} has led to some concern over its use. A report {{released}} by the European Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-food Products Intended for Consumers (SCCNFP) in 2003 also concluded that insufficient information was available to allow for an adequate risk assessment analysis of MIT.|$|E
25|$|Individuals who are atopic (genetically {{predisposed}} to developing certain allergic hypersensitivity reactions) {{are more likely}} to have a reaction to eggplant, which may be because eggplant is high in histamines. A few proteins and at least one secondary metabolite have been identified as potential allergens. Cooking eggplant thoroughly seems to preclude reactions in some individuals, but at least one of the <b>allergenic</b> proteins survives the cooking process.|$|E
25|$|Some countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, have wine {{labeling}} {{laws that}} {{require the use of}} fining agents that may be an <b>allergenic</b> substance to appear on the wine label. A study conducted by the University of California, Davis Department of Viticulture and Enology, however, found that no detectable amount of inorganic fining agents, and only trace quantities of proteinaceous agents, are left in the wine.|$|E
25|$|Online {{resources}} for allergy information {{are also available}} on http://www.allergen.org. Such data is valuable for investigation of cross-reactivity between known allergens and analysis of potential allergenicity in proteins. The Structural Database of Allergen Proteins (SDAP) stores information of <b>allergenic</b> proteins. The Food Allergy Research and Resource Program (FARRP) Protein Allergen-Online Database contains sequences of known and putative allergens derived from scientific literature and public databases. Allergome emphasizes the annotation of allergens that result in an IgE-mediated disease.|$|E
25|$|Allergies, while a {{critical}} subject of immunology, also vary considerably among individuals {{and sometimes even}} among genetically similar individuals. The assessment of protein <b>allergenic</b> potential focuses on three main aspects: (i) immunogenicity; (ii) cross-reactivity; and (iii) clinical symptoms. Immunogenicity is due to responses of an IgE antibody-producing B cell and/or of a T cell to a particular allergen. Therefore, immunogenicity studies focus mainly on identifying recognition sites of B-cells and T-cells for allergens. The three-dimensional structural properties of allergens control their allergenicity.|$|E
25|$|Flowers may {{be small}} and inconspicuous, {{as well as}} green and not showy. They produce {{enormous}} numbers of relatively small pollen grains (hence wind-pollinated plants may be allergens, but seldom are animal-pollinated plants <b>allergenic).</b> Their stigmas may be large and feathery to catch the pollen grains. Insects may visit them to collect pollen; in some cases, these are ineffective pollinators and exert little natural selection on the flowers, {{but there are also}} examples of ambophilous flowers which are both wind and insect pollinated.|$|E
25|$|Pea {{protein is}} a hypoallergenic protein with a lighter texture {{than most other}} protein powders. Pea protein has an amino acid profile {{similar to that of}} soy, but pea protein does not elicit {{concerns}} about unknown effects of phytoestrogens. Pea protein is also less <b>allergenic</b> than soy. Pea protein has high fiber content and has no allergic ingredients and therefore is easy for digestion as compared to whey protein. Pea protein is a slow digesting protein and is able to keep you full longer.|$|E
25|$|Allergy {{undergoes}} dynamic {{changes over}} time. Regular allergy testing of relevant allergens {{provides information on}} if and how patient management can be changed, {{in order to improve}} health and quality of life. Annual testing is often the practice for determining whether allergy to milk, egg, soy, and wheat have been outgrown, and the testing interval is extended to 2–3 years for allergy to peanut, tree nuts, fish, and crustacean shellfish. Results of follow-up testing can guide decision-making regarding whether and when it is safe to introduce or re-introduce <b>allergenic</b> food into the diet.|$|E
25|$|Latex {{can trigger}} an IgE-mediated cutaneous, respiratory, and {{systemic}} reaction. The prevalence of latex allergy {{in the general}} population is believed to be less than one percent. In a hospital study, 1 in 800 surgical patients (0.125 percent) reported latex sensitivity, although the sensitivity among healthcare workers is higher, between seven and ten percent. Researchers attribute this higher level to the exposure of healthcare workers to areas with significant airborne latex allergens, such as operating rooms, intensive-care units, and dental suites. These latex-rich environments may sensitize healthcare workers who regularly inhale <b>allergenic</b> proteins.|$|E
25|$|Ginkgo biloba {{leaves and}} sarcotesta also contain ginkgolic acids, which are highly <b>allergenic,</b> {{long-chain}} alkylphenols such as bilobol or adipostatin A (bilobol is a substance related to anacardic acid from cashew nut shells and urushiols present in poison ivy and other Toxicodendron spp.) Individuals {{with a history}} of strong allergic reactions to poison ivy, mangoes, cashews and other alkylphenol-producing plants are more likely to experience allergic reaction when consuming non-standardized ginkgo-containing preparations, combinations, or extracts thereof. The level of these allergens in standardized pharmaceutical preparations from Ginkgo biloba was restricted to 5 ppm by the Commission E of the former Federal German Health Authority.|$|E
25|$|If later {{exposure}} to the same allergen occurs, the allergen can bind to the IgE molecules held {{on the surface of}} the mast cells or basophils. Cross-linking of the IgE and Fc receptors occurs when more than one IgE-receptor complex interacts with the same <b>allergenic</b> molecule, and activates the sensitized cell. Activated mast cells and basophils undergo a process called degranulation, during which they release histamine and other inflammatory chemical mediators (cytokines, interleukins, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins) from their granules into the surrounding tissue causing several systemic effects, such as vasodilation, mucous secretion, nerve stimulation, and smooth muscle contraction. This results in rhinorrhea, itchiness, dyspnea, and anaphylaxis. Depending on the individual, allergen, and mode of introduction, the symptoms can be system-wide (classical anaphylaxis), or localized to particular body systems; asthma is localized to the respiratory system and eczema is localized to the dermis.|$|E
25|$|These {{biological}} chemicals {{can arise}} from {{a host of}} means, {{but there are two}} common classes: (a) moisture induced growth of mold colonies and (b) natural substances released into the air such as animal dander and plant pollen. Mold is always associated with moisture, and its growth can be inhibited by keeping humidity levels below 50%. Moisture buildup inside buildings may arise from water penetrating compromised areas of the building envelope or skin, from plumbing leaks, from condensation due to improper ventilation, or from ground moisture penetrating a building part. Even something as simple as drying clothes indoors on radiators can increase the risk of exposure to (amongst other things) Aspergillus - a highly dangerous mould that can be fatal for asthma sufferers and the elderly. In areas where cellulosic materials (paper and wood, including drywall) become moist and fail to dry within 48 hours, mold mildew can propagate and release <b>allergenic</b> spores into the air.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} cultivars {{are completely}} male and are highly <b>allergenic,</b> with an OPALS allergy scale rating of 8 or higher: ...|$|E
500|$|... 20 {{percent of}} jack jumper ants have an empty venom sac, so failure {{to display a}} sting {{reaction}} should not {{be interpreted as a}} loss of sensitivity. Substantial amounts of ant venom have been analysed to characterise venom components, and the jack jumper has been a main subject in these studies. An East Carolina University study which summarised the knowledge about ant stings and their venom showed that only the fire ant and jack jumper had the <b>allergenic</b> components of their venom extensively investigated. These <b>allergenic</b> components include peptides found as heterodimers, homodimers and pilosulin 3. Only six Myrmecia ants, including the jack jumper, are capable of inducing IgE antibodies. Due to the vast differentiation of venom produced in each Myrmecia species, and other species sharing similar characteristics to the jack jumper ant, diagnosing which ant is responsible for an anaphylactic reaction is difficult. A review of a patients history with allergies while identifying a positive result of venom specific IgE levels helps to identify the species of ant that caused a reaction.|$|E
500|$|Plant {{medicines}} {{have often}} not been tested systematically, but {{have come into}} use informally over the centuries. By 2007, clinical trials had demonstrated potentially useful activity in nearly 16% of herbal medicines; there was limited in vitro or in vivo evidence for roughly half the medicines; there was only phytochemical evidence for around 20%; 0.5% were <b>allergenic</b> or toxic; and some 12% had basically never been studied scientifically. According to Cancer Research UK, [...] "there is currently no strong evidence from studies in people that herbal remedies can treat, prevent or cure cancer".|$|E
2500|$|Olive tree pollen is {{extremely}} <b>allergenic,</b> with an OPALS allergy scale rating of 10 out of 10. Olea europaea is primarily wind-pollinated, and their light, buoyant pollen {{is a strong}} trigger for asthma. One popular variety, [...] "Swan Hill", is widely sold as an [...] "allergy-free" [...] olive tree; however, this variety does bloom and produce <b>allergenic</b> pollen.|$|E
2500|$|... in the {{production}} of hypoallergenic food where proteases break down specific <b>allergenic</b> proteins into nonallergenic peptides. For example, proteases are used to produce hypoallergenic baby food from cow’s milk thereby diminishing the risk of babies developing milk allergies.|$|E
2500|$|The IgE {{antibodies}} {{are more}} typically found in allergy-related {{conditions such as}} urticaria, asthma, and wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis. The target of the most <b>allergenic</b> antibodies is ω-5 gliadin, [...] which is encoded by the Gli-1B gene found on the B haplome (Aegilops speltoides derived) of wheat.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Osada et al. {{state that}} because {{parasitic}} worms may and often do consist of allergens themselves, {{the degree to}} which they pacify or agitate the immune response against allergens is a balance of their regulating effects and their <b>allergenic</b> components. [...] Therefore, depending on both of these variables, some parasitic worms may worsen allergies.|$|E
2500|$|To {{avoid an}} {{allergic}} reaction, a strict diet can be followed. [...] It {{is difficult to}} determine the amount of <b>allergenic</b> food required to elicit a reaction, so complete avoidance should be attempted. [...] In some cases, hypersensitive reactions can be triggered by exposures to allergens through skin contact, inhalation, kissing, participation in sports, blood transfusions, cosmetics, and alcohol.|$|E
2500|$|... 2S albumins form a {{major group}} of {{homologous}} storage proteins in many dicot species {{and in some}} monocots but not in grasses (cereals). Soybeans contain a small but significant 2S storage protein. 2S albumin are grouped in the prolamin superfamily. Other <b>allergenic</b> proteins included in this 'superfamily' are the non-specific plant lipid transfer proteins, alpha amylase inhibitor, trypsin inhibitors, and prolamin storage proteins of cereals and grasses.|$|E
2500|$|The use of immunoinformatics tools can {{be useful}} to predict protein {{allergenicity}} and will become increasingly important in the screening of novel foods before their wide-scale release for human use. Thus, there are major efforts under way to make reliable broad based allergy databases and combine these with well validated prediction tools in order to enable the identification of potential allergens in genetically modified drugs and foods. Though the developments are on primary stage, the World Health organization and Food and Agriculture Organization have proposed guidelines for evaluating allergenicity of genetically modified foods. According to the Codex alimentarius, a protein is potentially <b>allergenic</b> if it possesses an identity of ≥6 contiguous amino acids or ≥35% sequence similarity over an 80 amino acid window with a known allergen. Though there are rules, their inherent limitations have started to become apparent and exceptions to the rules have been well reported [...] So to make these things easier computational tools and algorithms have been actively developed to assess the <b>allergenic</b> potential of genetically modified food crops, bio-pharmaceuticals and various other products.|$|E
2500|$|According to Dr. Hopkin, asthma {{involves}} atopic allergy, {{which in}} turn involves the release of mediators that induce inflammation. [...] In 2007, Dr. Melendez and his associates studied filarial nematodes and ES-62, a protein that nematodes secrete in their host. [...] They discovered that pure ES-62 prevents the release of <b>allergenic</b> inflammatory mediators in mice, resulting in weaker allergic and asthmatic symptoms. [...] In the Journal of Immunology, Dr. Bashir et al. describe their experimental findings that an allergic response against peanuts is inhibited in mice infected with an intestinal parasite.|$|E
2500|$|Allergic {{reactions}} to tattoo pigments, while uncommon, {{are most often}} seen with red, yellow, and occasionally white. [...] Reactions can be triggered by exposure to sunlight. People who are sensitive or allergic to certain metals may react to pigments in the skin with swelling and/or itching, and/or oozing of clear fluid called serum. Such reactions are quite rare, however, and some artists will recommend performing a test patch. Because the mercury and Azo-chemicals in red dyes are more commonly <b>allergenic</b> than other pigments, allergic reactions are most often seen in red tattoos. [...] Less frequent allergic {{reactions to}} black, purple, and green pigments have also been noted.|$|E
2500|$|Ragweed allergy sufferers {{may show}} signs of oral allergy syndrome, a food allergy {{classified}} by a cluster of allergic reactions in the mouth {{in response to the}} consumption certain fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Foods commonly involved include beans, celery, cumin, hazelnuts, kiwifruit, parsley, potatoes, bananas, melons, cucumbers, and zucchini. Because cooking usually denatures the proteins that cause the reaction, the foods are more <b>allergenic</b> when eaten raw; exceptions are celery and nuts, which may not be safe even when cooked. Signs of reaction can include itching, burning, and swelling of the mouth and throat, runny eyes and nose, hives, and, less commonly, vomiting, diarrhea, asthma, and anaphylaxis. These symptoms are due to the abnormal increase of IgE antibodies which attach to a type of immune cell called mast cells. [...] When the ragweed antigen then attaches to these antibodies the mast cells release histamine and other symptom evoking chemicals.|$|E
2500|$|Wheat allergy is {{an allergy}} which {{typically}} presents {{itself as a}} food allergy, but {{can also be a}} contact allergy resulting from occupational exposure to wheat. Like all allergies, wheat allergy involves immunoglobulin E and mast cell response. [...] Typically the allergy is limited to the seed storage proteins of wheat, some reactions are restricted to wheat proteins, while others can react across many varieties of seeds and other plant tissues. Wheat allergy may be a misnomer since there are many <b>allergenic</b> components in wheat, for example serine protease inhibitors, glutelins and prolamins and different responses are often attributed to different proteins. Twenty-seven potential wheat allergens have been successfully identified. The most severe response is exercise/aspirin induced anaphylaxis attributed to one omega gliadin that is a relative of the protein that causes celiac disease. Other more common symptoms include nausea, urticaria, atopy. Gluten sensitivity is not usually classified as a wheat allergy.|$|E
