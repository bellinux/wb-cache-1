5|$|In QFT, {{the demand}} for {{relativistic}} invariance enters, among other ways in that the S-matrix necessarily must be Poincaré invariant. This has the implication {{that there is one}} or more infinite-dimensional representation of the Lorentz group acting on Fock space. One way to guarantee the existence of such representations is the existence of a Lagrangian description (with modest requirements imposed, see the reference) of the system using the canonical formalism, from which <b>a</b> <b>realization</b> of the generators of the Lorentz group may be deduced.|$|E
5|$|The Kiss is an oil {{painting}} on canvas {{completed by the}} Norwegian symbolist artist Edvard Munch in 1897. Part of his Frieze of Life, which depicts the stages of a relationship between men and women, The Kiss is <b>a</b> <b>realization</b> of a motif with which he had experimented since 1888/89: a couple kissing, their faces fusing as one in a symbolic representation of their unity. Exhibited as early as 1903, this work is held at the Munch Museum in Oslo.|$|E
5|$|The {{invention}} of electronic {{computers in the}} 1940s, along {{with the development of}} mathematical information theory, led to <b>a</b> <b>realization</b> that brains can potentially be understood as information processing systems. This concept formed the basis of the field of cybernetics, and eventually gave rise to the field now known as computational neuroscience. The earliest attempts at cybernetics were somewhat crude in that they treated the brain as essentially a digital computer in disguise, as for example in John von Neumann's 1958 book, The Computer and the Brain. Over the years, though, accumulating information about the electrical responses of brain cells recorded from behaving animals has steadily moved theoretical concepts in the direction of increasing realism.|$|E

5|$|Amid the {{euphoria}} generated by Egypt's military intervention, serious unity discussions commenced between Syria and Egypt. Towards {{the end of}} October, Anwar al-Sadat, the Egyptian speaker of parliament, visited the Syrian parliament in Damascus {{in a gesture of}} solidarity, only for the visit to end with the Syrian parliament voting unanimously to enter into a union with Egypt without delay. A Syrian delegation then headed for Cairo to persuade Nasser to accept unity with Syria, but Nasser expressed his reservations regarding unity to the delegates and Quwatli, who was in Damascus. Nasser was wary of the Syrian military's habitual interference in the country's political affairs and the stark difference in the countries' economies and political systems. The Syrian political and military leadership continued to press Nasser out of both sincere commitment to Arab nationalism and <b>a</b> <b>realization</b> that only unification with Egypt could prevent impending strife in the country due to increasing communist influence.|$|E
5|$|Hemlock Hoax is {{a detective}} who has little respect {{in the small}} {{tropical}} town where he lives, {{despite the fact that}} he thinks he is a better sleuth than Sherlock Holmes. A pair of boys decide to play a trick on Hoax and tell him about a murder. Hoax rushes to scene of the crime where he discovers a shred of cloth, later finding that a tramp is wearing the same type of clothes that he found. The tramp runs away and Hoax gives chase, with other people helping the pursuit. Eventually, Hoax captures the tramp with the aid of a police officer, and returns to the victim's body with the man. Hoax then comes to <b>a</b> <b>realization</b> that the body was just a dummy that had been stuffed with the leaves. The crowd has a laugh at Hoax's expense while the two boys are punished.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the local reducibility properties of linear realizations of codes on finite graphs. Trimness and properness are dual properties of constraint codes. <b>A</b> linear <b>realization</b> is locally reducible if any constraint code is not both trim and proper. On a finite cycle-free graph, <b>a</b> linear <b>realization</b> is minimal if and only if every constraint code is both trim and proper. <b>A</b> linear <b>realization</b> is called observable if it is one-to-one, and controllable if all constraints are independent. Observability and controllability are dual properties. An unobservable or uncontrollable realization is locally reducible. <b>A</b> parity-check <b>realization</b> is uncontrollable if and only if it has redundant parity checks. <b>A</b> tail-biting trellis <b>realization</b> is uncontrollable if and only if its trajectories partition into disconnected subrealizations.

5|$|Tea is {{the second}} most {{consumed}} beverage in the world, after water. Argo was founded in response to <b>a</b> <b>realization</b> that Americans had so few tea offerings that they generally were unfamiliar with anything but bagged teas. At the time, most tea retailers either supplied bulk tea for home brewing or traditional sit-down service, but Argo focused on premium specialty drinks in paper cups. Meanwhile, a minority of Asian immigrants from countries such as India, Vietnam and China where tea is the national beverage were spreading some of their traditions. Argo endeavored to emphasize the healthy aspects of tea as an alternative to coffee. When it was founded, Argo was part of a field of blossoming tea cafe franchises meeting a burgeoning demand. By 2002, there were 1,100 tearooms with sit-down service. In 2003, retail sales of tea totaled $5.1billion, and in 2005, as the specialty tea market was growing 20percent per year, the total retail tea market was expected to surpass $10 billion by 2010.|$|E
