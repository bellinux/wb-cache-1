5|$|M-22 is an {{original}} trunkline, {{dating to the}} July 1, 1919 designation of the system. In 1929, the highway was rerouted along {{the west side of}} Little Glen Lake, using the modern M-109 around the lake. M-22 would be rerouted back <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> present routing the next year, and M-109 was designated {{on the west side of}} the lake in its place.|$|E
5|$|Near Wadhams, I-69 curves <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{north to}} follow {{part of the}} Black River. On {{the east side of}} the community, the freeway turns back to the {{southeast}} as it enters the western edge of the Port Huron suburbs. I-69 turns again to run due eastward to intersect I-94. The two freeways merge in an interchange that also has connections to BL I-69. Past the interchange, the freeway curves to the north and back <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east to cross the Black River. On the eastern bank, I-94/I-69 travels through one more interchange, this one for M-25 and BL I-69/BL I-94. Past the interchange, the freeway crosses through the toll and customs plazas for the twin-span Blue Water Bridge. The I-69 designation officially ends at the international boundary in the middle of the St. Clair River where it connects with Highway402.|$|E

5|$|After {{crossing}} Golden Avenue, I-194 curves to {{the northwest}} to meet the M-96 (Columbia Avenue) interchange. The freeway runs underneath the Columbia Avenue overpass before running parallel {{to the west bank}} of the Kalamazoo River. The freeway crosses the river at the southern end of Lower Mill Pond. Curving back <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast, I-194 meets Business Loop I-94 (BLI-94, Dickman Road). Here the AADT counts average 24,400vehicles a day. The freeway ends at an at-grade intersection with Hamblin Avenue, and continuing north of the intersection, the highway becomes just M-66. BLI-94 runs east of the freeway end on Hamblin Avenue to connect to Michigan Avenue. All of I-194 is listed on the National Highway System, a system of strategically important highways, and it is concurrent with M-66 for the length of the freeway.|$|E
5|$|As US31 curves <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{northeast}} and east in Charlevoix County, it follows {{a section of}} the Lake Michigan shoreline that is not considered to be part of any bay. The highway continues through Northern Michigan agricultural areas to the southeast of Charlevoix. Once it enters the city, the trunkline intersects the northern end of M-66 and follows a series of city streets to a drawbridge over the channel that connects Lake Charlevoix to Lake Michigan. South of the structure it is Bridge Street, and north of the bridge it is Michigan Avenue. The highway turns eastward to exit town on Petoskey Avenue and follow the Lake Michigan shoreline. Near the community of Bay Shore, US31 crosses into Emmet County. The trunkline continues past the Bay Harbor development on Charlevoix Avenue into the city of Petoskey.|$|E
5|$|Bonnie {{remained}} virtually stationary {{until the}} morning of September23 when it drifted very slowly to the west-southwest {{in response to the}} ridge. It also began to gradually weaken as the low-level center became exposed and the storm became poorly organized. Convection also diminished, and on the afternoon of September24, Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical storm as it drifted over cooler waters. Bonnie continued to lose most of its deep convection during the day on September25 as it began to make a turn back <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south. That evening, Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E

5|$|Brundage, {{through his}} tenure, slowly came <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{position}} advocated by Iron Curtain IOC members, that {{the important thing}} was to recognize the mainland, with Taiwan of less importance. Although the mainland Chinese were invited by the Munich Olympic organizers to send an observer delegation to Munich (they declined due to the Taiwanese presence), {{it was not until}} 1975, after Brundage's departure as president, that the PRC applied to rejoin the Olympic movement. The PRC again participated at the 1980 Winter Games at Lake Placid and then the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles; the island NOC competed as the Republic of China in 1968 and 1972; when refused permission to compete under that name in 1976, after Brundage's death, it boycotted the 1976 and 1980 games, returning in 1984 as Chinese Taipei.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the year}} the Turkish forces had been pushed out of the Sinai, and in January 1917, orders were given for the {{division}} to attack Rafa on the Egyptian–Palestine border. By dawn on 9 January, the regiment and division had reached the border, and the brigade manoeuvred to attack Rafa from the north-east. The 8th Squadron, leading the regiment, was moving <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north of village, when the Turkish defenders opened fire on them. The regiment galloped forward, and one of their troops captured fifty prisoners at a police post. The remainder captured an uncompleted trench system, and another 171 prisoners, six of them German officers. The regiment was now position to block the Turkish withdrawal east, and were also able to observe the main Turkish defences.|$|E
5|$|Henry Fownes Luttrell, {{who married}} Margaret, Alexander's daughter, {{and took the}} Luttrell name, moved to Dunster in 1747. The couple {{redesigned}} and redecorated the castle in a Rococo style, including the extensive use of the recently invented and highly fashionable wallpaper. Henry Luttrell raised the ground height of the Lower Ward between 1764 and 1765 to extend the New Way all <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front of his mansion, adding additional ornamental towers onto {{the inside of the}} Great Gatehouse in the process. A folly, Conygar Tower, was constructed by architect Richard Phelps to improve the view from the castle, and a larger park of 141 hectares (348acres) was built just to the south of the castle, requiring the eviction of a number of tenant farmers.|$|E

5|$|Hodgkinson {{worked his}} way <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left towards the Indonesian line of approach, {{subsequently}} engaging and killing two more, and wounding a third. Guest gathered the right hand elements of 7 Platoon, hooking around Hodgkinson and counter-attacking the remaining Indonesians, killing the previously wounded soldier and one other. Yet another wounded Indonesian was observed to crawl away while the tenth proceeded to run off unharmed back in the direction from which the patrol had come. Within twenty minutes the contact was over and the Australians proceeded to collect the discarded Indonesian weapons and equipment, including a Browning Automatic Rifle, three MI rifles and 200 rounds of ammunition. Dressed in US steel helmets, green shirts and blue and khaki shorts, the Indonesian soldiers were subsequently identified as members of 440 Battalion.|$|E
5|$|I-75/US23 {{enters the}} {{southern}} {{reaches of the}} suburban Tri-Cities at Bridgeport and proceeds northward through the area. The freeway passes {{to the east of}} downtown Saginaw. I-675 splits off to run westward into downtown, and I-75 curves <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest to cross the Saginaw River on the Zilwaukee Bridge in the suburb of Zilwaukee. North of the river, I-675 reconnects to I-75, which continues northward into Bay County. The freeway passes to the west of Bay City, encountering the eastern end of the US10 freeway. From there, I-75/US23 curves northwesterly to bypass Kawkawlin before continuing north to the Standish area through farmlands inland from the Saginaw Bay. West of Standish, US23 splits to follow the Lake Huron shoreline, and I-75 turns northwesterly to run inland.|$|E
5|$|M-40 {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with US12 in rural Cass County. Running north through farm fields, the highway rounds Bar Lake {{and into the}} community of Jones. The area around Jones has a few more lakes in a wooded setting. As the trunkline continues north, it passes back into farm lands. The road curves <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest as it passes between Bogart Lake and Streeters Mill Pond near Dutch Settlement Road. M-40 follows Centre Street into Marcellus. When the highway meets {{the western end of}} M-216 in town, M-40 turns west along Main Street and runs out of town. The roadway returns to a northerly course, and later it curves northwesterly again near Cedar Lake near the Van Buren County line.|$|E

5|$|Max and Steph become {{attracted}} to each other. Max plunges into grief and remorse for bringing estranged wife Clare Cunningham (Gemma Bissix) {{into the lives}} of the people he cares about. Steph feels sorry for him and invites him out. Max tries to kiss her. Steph and Max began to misread each other and, even as they developed feelings for each other, assume there is no chance at a relationship. When Max took Tom to the safari park to see an elephant named Romeo, that Steph had sponsored for him, Steph found him and they finally told each other that they liked each other and agreed to get into a relationship. Tom initially disapproves of their relationship, but comes <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> idea.|$|E

Meanwhile, Quagmire accidentally starts a fire.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of the Mackinac Bridge, {{travelers}} wishing to venture from St. Ignace to Mackinaw City had to do so via ferry. M-122 began at US2 (now Business Loop Interstate 75) near Straits State Park and traveled through town along Ferry Road where it ran southeasterly from the main highway. East of Hornbach Street M-122 curved <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east near Paro Street. The highway ended at the State Ferry Docks on the southeast side of the city next to the Coast Guard station.|$|E

The 2040 master plan includes an extension from the intersection of the Southport Connector and Florida's Turnpike <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east end of the existing Osceola Parkway, including a connection with SR 417 and Orlando International Airport.|$|E
5|$|The radar {{contacts}} were, in fact, {{the approaching}} 31 Japanese torpedo bombers, who circled <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south of TF18 {{so that they}} could attack from the east, with the black backdrop of the eastern sky behind them. From this direction, the Japanese bombers were hidden by the night sky, but Giffen's ships were silhouetted against the twilight of the western horizon. The 705AG aircraft attacked first, beginning at 19:19. Nakamura's aircraft missed with all of their torpedoes and one was shot down by anti-aircraft fire from Giffen's ships.|$|E
5|$|This {{season ends}} on a cliffhanger {{due to the}} Writers' Strike.
