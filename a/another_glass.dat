2500|$|Louis Meyer {{requested}} {{a glass of}} buttermilk after winning his second Indy 500 race in 1933. After winning his third title in 1936, he requested <b>another</b> <b>glass</b> but instead received a bottle. He was captured by a photographer {{in the act of}} swigging from the bottle while holding up three fingers to signify the third win. [...] A local dairy company executive recognized the marketing opportunity in the image and, being unaware Meyer was drinking buttermilk, offered a bottle of milk to the winners of future races. [...] Milk has been presented each year since then, apart from 1947 to 1955. Modern drivers are offered a choice of whole, 2%, and skim.|$|E
2500|$|Newman et al. (2006) {{inserted}} conductive and non-conductive fibers into a collagen-TERP scaffold (collagen cross-linked with a terpolymer of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPAAm) [...] ). The fibers were embedded by tightly wrapping {{them on a}} {{small glass}} slide and sandwiching a collagen-TERP solution between it and <b>another</b> <b>glass</b> slide; spacers between the glass slides set the gel thickness to 800µm. The conductive fibers were carbon fiber and Kevlar, and the nonconductive fibers were nylon-6 and tungsten wire. Neurites extend in all directions in thick bundles on the carbon fiber; however with the other three fibers, neurites extended in fine web-like conformations. The neurites showed no directional growth on the carbon and Kevlar fibers, but they grew along the nylon-6 fibers {{and to some extent}} along the tungsten wire. The tungsten wire and nylon-6 fiber scaffolds had neurites grow into the gel near the fiber-gel interface in addition to growing along the surface. All fiber gels except Kevlar showed a significant increase in neurite extension compared to non-fiber gels. There was no difference in the neurite extension between the non-conductive and the conductive fibers.|$|E

5000|$|... "Angels in the Sky" [...] is {{a popular}} song by Dick Glasser. It was {{published}} in 1954 and has been recorded {{by a number of}} artists.

In 1954, Gale would strike a deal with RCA Victor for the song and it was then recorded and released by Tony Martin on RCA Victor #5757 about August 1954, flipped with [...] "Boulevard Of Nightingales". A part of the deal was that Glasser's recording would be withdrawn from the market.|$|R
