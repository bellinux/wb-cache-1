500|$|Midget {{submarine}} M-21—from I-22—probably {{entered the}} harbour {{at the same}} time that USS Chicago opened fire on M-24. [...] The unarmed auxiliary patrol boat HMAS Lauriana spotted M-21 and illuminated the submarine's conning tower, while sending an <b>alert</b> <b>signal</b> to the Port War Signal Station at South Head, and the nearby anti-submarine vessel HMAS Yandra. [...] Yandra attempted to ram the submarine, lost contact, regained contact at 23:03, and dropped six depth charges. At the time of the attack, it was assumed that the depth charges had destroyed or disabled the midget, but M-21 survived. Historians believe that the midget took refuge on the harbour floor and waited until the Allied vessels had moved away before it resumed the attack.|$|E

40|$|<b>Alerting</b> <b>signals</b> often {{serve to}} reduce {{temporal}} uncertainty by predicting {{the time of}} stimulus onset. The resulting response time benefits have often been explained by facilitated translation of stimulus codes into response codes {{on the basis of}} established stimulus-response (S-R) links. In paradigms of masked S-R priming <b>alerting</b> <b>signals</b> also modulate response activation processes triggered by subliminally presented prime stimuli. In the present study we tested whether facilitation of visuo-motor translation processes due to <b>alerting</b> <b>signals</b> critically depends on established S-R links. <b>Alerting</b> <b>signals</b> resulted in significantly enhanced masked priming effects for masked prime stimuli that included and that did not include established S-R links (i. e., target vs. novel primes). Yet, the alerting-priming interaction was more pronounced for target than for novel primes. These results suggest that effects of <b>alerting</b> <b>signals</b> on masked priming are especially evident when S-R links between prime and target exist. At the same time, an alerting-priming interaction also for novel primes suggests that <b>alerting</b> <b>signals</b> also facilitate stimulus-response translation processes when masked prime stimuli provide action-trigger conditions in terms of programmed S-R links...|$|R

30|$|Network {{parameters}} can {{be added}} to the DAS interface as, for example, DCP-dependent link rates. Of particular importance is phase 4 where signals are triggered on the base of rainfall thresholds. In order to keep the model simple in a first approach, each DCP has its geographical position referenced as a simple attribute. Real <b>alert</b> <b>signals</b> may be created by integrating information over vast catchment areas in the cases where the network sensor density is below a certain value. <b>Alert</b> <b>signals</b> should ideally take into account soil features such as topology, porosity, and permeability, along with the need of solving hydrological models on real time [34]. For simplicity, our model allows the reproduction of real cases by proper calibrations of statistical rain distributions instead of using first principle modeling.|$|R

50|$|The Yellow Alert and Red Alert signals {{correspond}} to the earlier <b>Alert</b> <b>Signal</b> and Attack Signal, respectively, and the early Federal Signal AR timer siren control units featured the Take Cover button labeled with a red background, and the Alert button labeled with a yellow background. Later AF timers changed the color-coding, coloring the Alert button blue, the Take Cover button yellow, and the Fire button red (used to call out volunteer fire fighters), thus confusing the color-coding of the alerts. In 1955, the Federal Civil Defense Administration again revised the warning signals, altering them to adapt to deal with concern over nuclear fallout. The new set of signals were the <b>Alert</b> <b>Signal</b> (unchanged) and the Take-Cover Signal (previously the Attack Signal). The All-Clear signal was deleted because leaving a shelter while fallout was present would be hazardous.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, several sets {{of warning}} tones {{have been used}} which varied over time, by {{government}} structure, and by manufacturer. The initial alerts used during World War II were the <b>Alert</b> <b>Signal</b> (a 3-5 minute steady continuous siren tone), and the Attack Signal (a 3-5 minute wail siren tone, or series of short tone bursts on devices incapable of wavering, such as whistles). The Victory Siren manual stated that when manual generation of the warbling tone was required, it could be achieved by holding the Signal switch on for 8 seconds and off for 4 seconds. In 1950, the Federal Civil Defense Administration revised the signals, naming the <b>alert</b> <b>signal</b> [...] "red alert" [...] and adding an [...] "all-clear" [...] signal, defined as three one-minute steady blasts, with two minutes of silence between blasts.|$|E

40|$|International audienceUNLABELLED: ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Attention is {{impaired}} in schizophrenia. Early attention components include orienting and alerting, as well {{as executive}} control networks. Previous studies have shown mainly executive control deficits, while few of them found orienting and alerting abnormalities. Here we explore the different attentive networks, their modulation and interactions in patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: Twenty-one schizophrenic patients (DSMIV), compared to 21 controls, performed {{a modified version of}} the Attention Network Task, in which an orienting paradigm (with valid, invalid and no cues) was combined with a flanker task (congruent/incongruent) and an <b>alerting</b> <b>signal</b> (tone/no tone), to assess orienting, executive control and alerting networks independently. RESULTS: Patients showed an abnormal alerting effect and slower overall reaction time compared to controls. Moreover, there was an interaction between orienting and alerting: patients are helped more than controls by the <b>alerting</b> <b>signal</b> in a valid orientation to solve the incongruent condition. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that patients with schizophrenia have altered alerting abilities. However, the orienting and alerting cues interact to improve their attention performance in the resolution of conflict, creating possibilities for cognitive remediation strategies...|$|R

This is done using the Alert-Info header field. However, the reference (typically a URL) addresses only a specific network resource with specific rendering properties. There is currently no support for standard identifiers for describing the semantics of the alerting situation or the characteristics of the <b>alerting</b> <b>signal,</b> without being tied to a particular rendering.

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study of}} reports relating to cockpit altitude alert systems was performed. A recent {{change in the}} Federal Air Regulation permits the system to be modified so that the <b>alerting</b> <b>signal</b> approaching altitude has only a visual component; the auditory signal {{would continue to be}} heard if a deviation from an assigned altitude occurred. Failure to observe altitude <b>alert</b> <b>signals</b> and failure to reset the system were the commonest cause of altitude deviations related to this system. Cockpit crew distraction was the most frequent reason for these failures. It was noted by numerous reporters that the presence of altitude alert system made them less aware of altitude; this lack of altitude awareness is discussed. Failures of crew coordination were also noted. It is suggested that although modification of the altitude alert system may be highly desirable in short-haul aircraft, it may not be desirable for long-haul aircraft in which cockpit workloads are much lower for long periods of time. In these cockpits, the aural alert approaching altitudes is perceived as useful and helpful. If the systems are to be modified, it appears that additional emphasis on altitude awareness during recurrent training will be necessary; {{it is also possible that}} flight crew operating procedures during climb and descent may need examination with respect to monitoring responsibilities.
