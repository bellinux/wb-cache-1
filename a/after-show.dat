New York World-Telegram critic Burton Rascoe particularly emphasized the groundbreaking choreography, stating that [...] "Richard Rodgers has written for the show one of the finest musical scores any musical play ever had. Next to Mr. Rodgers, however, must stand the amazing Agnes de Mille, whose choreography, carried out to perfection by her ballet , is actually the biggest hit of the show. The [...] "Out of My Dreams" [...] and [...] "All Er Nuthin'" [...] dances are such supreme aesthetic delights.... They are spinetingling, out of this world." [...] In The New York Sun, Ward Morehouse commented that [...] "Oklahoma! is charming and leisurely. And tunely. And certainly not topical," [...] as other shows had been in the early years of World War II. [...] "It reveals Mr. Rodgers, shorn only for the moment of Larry Hart, in good form indeed. And nobody in last night's audience seemed to have a better time than Mr. Hart himself, who applauded the proceedings from a seat in Row B." [...] Lorenz Hart himself [...] "pushed his way through the crowd at the <b>after-show</b> party in Sardi's restaurant and threw his arms around his ex-partner, grinning from ear to ear. He told Rodgers he had never had a better evening at the theater in his life." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Mass has the Egyptian notes—a prayer {{before the}} lections, {{elsewhere}} {{unknown in the}} East; an exceptionally weighty body of intercessions after the catechumens dismissal, followed by a penitential act, probably identical with the [...] of Can. Hippol. 2, which disappeared in later rites; a setting of the Sanctus found in several Egyptian anaphoras; the close connection of the commemorations of the offerers and of the dead; and {{the form of the}} conclusion of the anaphora. The structure of the communion—with a prayer before and prayers of thanksgiving and blessing <b>after—shows</b> that Egypt had already developed the common type, otherwise first evidenced in Syria, ca. 375 (Ap. Const. viii. 13). Among the special characteristics of Serapion are the simplicity of the Sanctus, and of the Institution, which lacks the dramatic additions already found in Ap. Coust.; the interpolation of a passage containing a quotation from Didache 9 between the institutions of the bread and of the chalice; the form of the [...] and the invocation of the Word, not of the Holy Ghost, to effect consecration. That the Lord's Prayer before communion is not referred to may be only because it is a fixed formula belonging to the structure of the rite.|$|R
