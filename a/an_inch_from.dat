5|$|The {{miniature}} Enterprise {{was again}} {{used for the}} spacewalk sequence. Even on the large model, {{it was hard to}} make the miniature appear realistic in extreme close-up shots. To make the pullback shot work, the camera had to be within one-eighth of <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>from</b> the model. Painter Kim Smith spent several days on a tiny area of the model to add enough surface detail for the close-up, but even then the focus was barely adequate. To compensate, the crew used a wider-angle lens and shot at the highest f-stop they could. The live-action scenes of the spacewalking crew were then digitally added. Wide shots used footage of photo doubles walking across a large bluescreen draped across ILM's parking lot at night.|$|E
25|$|These {{mangroves}} {{are important}} nursery grounds {{for nearly all}} major angling fish including yellowfin bream (Acanthopagrus australis), flat-tail sea-mullet (Liza argentea), luderick (Girella tricuspidata) and sand whiting (Sillago ciliata) which are caught in adjoining waters as adults, mangroves also provide rich organic matter to the Port Hacking Estuary by fixing carbon into the river system through the addition of leaves into the thick rich black mud. Many crustacean and mollusc species rely on mangroves {{as a source of}} food whether by providing foraging through leaf litter, mud or direct predation of the mangrove trees and seeds. Soldier crabs (Mictyris longicarpus), semaphore crab (Heloecius cordiformis), blue swimmer crabs (Portunus pelagicus) and hermit crabs (Pagurus sinuatus) also call the mangroves home. A more casual visitor to the mangroves at high tide is the eastern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus australis) which scoots around just <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>from</b> the surface and is virtually invisible unless viewed through a snorkel.|$|E
500|$|Alexander retired the Yankees {{in order}} in the eighth inning. The Cardinals did nothing offensively {{in the top of}} the ninth inning, so it was up to Alexander to {{preserve}} the Cardinals' game in the bottom of the ninth. Alexander got the first two batters of the inning, Combs and Dugan, to ground out to third baseman Bell. With two outs and no runners on base, Alexander faced Ruth. Ruth had hit a solo home run and walked three times in the game. Manager Hornsby walked to the mound to talk with Alexander. Alexander told Hornsby that he would rather face Ruth than intentionally walk him. Alexander's first pitch to Ruth fell in for a solid strike in the middle of the plate. Alexander's next pitch fell outside of the strike zone for ball one. Ruth then fouled the next pitch, making the count one ball and two strikes. Alexander's next two pitches fell too low for balls two and three, making it a full count. The following full count pitch was noted by New York Herald Tribune sportswriter W. O. McGeehan: [...] "The count went to three and two, Ruth was swaying eagerly. The soupbone creaked again. The ball seemed a fraction of <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>from</b> being a strike. Ruth paused a moment. Even he was uncertain. Then he trotted down to first." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 18 September 1990: the IRA {{attempted}} to kill Air Chief Marshal Sir Peter Terry at his Staffordshire home. Terry {{had been a}} prime target since his days as Governor of Gibraltar, in which capacity he signed the documents allowing the SAS to operate against IRA volunteers in 1988. The revenge attack took place at 9pm at the Main Road house. The gunman opened fire through a window, hitting him at least nine times and injuring his wife, Lady Betty, near the eye. The couple's daughter, Elizabeth, was found suffering from shock. Peter Terry's face had to be rebuilt as the shots shattered his face, and two high-velocity bullets lodged a fraction of <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>from</b> his brain.|$|E

[...] Subsequently, [...] "he went over to see Congressman John Murtha (D-Pa), the 73-year old veteran Marine who had introduced a resolution the previous November calling for the redeployment of troops from Iraq as soon as practicable."

[...] One of the slashes from Rock's blade had come a mere eighth of <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>from</b> severing the warden's jugular, and he carried the scar from that wound to his deathbed. [...] None of the rioters had died, and Conley made sure they were all fully healed before bringing them up on charges. [...] Rock and Hayes were both given the death sentence for the assault, Stevens won his acquittal and served his original sentence, and Young's was extended to a life sentence. [...] Conley oversaw both of the executions (Rock on 16 June 1908 and Hayes on 2 April 1909). [...] The men were hanged using the upright jerker method, which used a [...] weight to jerk the sentenced man from his feet. [...] This method was supposed to snap the neck, but it failed in both instances. [...] Rock and Hayes {{were the only two}} men to be executed within the prison walls.|$|E
2500|$|WICB {{allowed the}} WSC players {{to appear in}} the 1979 World Cup, and the West Indies {{retained}} the title with little difficulty. By the end of 1979, the WSC disputes were resolved. Kallicharran was deposed after losing a six-match series one-nil in India and Lloyd returned as captain for a tour against a full-strength Australia (where the Windies won two-nil, with one draw) and New Zealand. The latter tour was full of controversy. New Zealand won the first Test at Dunedin by one wicket, but West Indies were never happy with the umpiring. West Indian discontent boiled over the next Test at Christchurch. While running into bowl, Colin Croft deliberately shouldered the umpire Fred Goodall. When Goodall went to talk to Lloyd about Croft's behaviour, he had to walk all the way to meet the West Indian captain, as the latter did not move <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>from</b> his position at the slips. After tea on the third day, West Indies refused to take the field unless Goodall was removed. They were persuaded to continue, and it took intense negotiations between the two boards to keep the tour on track. The Kiwis won the three match series after the second and third Tests ended in draws. [...] Nevertheless, the defeat proved to be the West Indies last Test series loss for the next 15 years.|$|E
