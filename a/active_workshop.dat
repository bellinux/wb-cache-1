40|$|The {{focus of}} the PPNW {{workshops}} is the physics of inland and coastal water bodies and their interactions with the physical and biogeochemical processes that control water quality, ecosystem function, and the services such systems provide. The workshops traditionally cover {{a broad spectrum of}} scientific topics. Besides general topics, the Trento workshop pays special attention to the coupling of physical and ecological processes and water quality in alpine and perialpine lakes. PPNW is an open workshop, actively seeking to expand contacts with neighbouring fields such as physical oceanography, the atmospheric sciences, and engineering.

40|$|Systems. This {{workshop}} is {{an opportunity}} to put into perspective the past and recent developments on the construction and use of automated software transformation tools (TS). The collection of papers presented herein capture a representative selection of the main topics addressed by TS researchers. The papers were solicited from known researchers in the field, and reviewed by active experts in the field for workshop relevance in terms of past lessons and future directions. As a consequence, we believe they represent an excellent although brief snapshot of the current technology and perspectives for such systems. However, rather than being a conference record, STS 99 is intended to be an <b>active</b> <b>workshop.</b> With presentations ranging from deductive synthesis systems to highly scalable prototypes, and interactive panels on past failures/successes and future directions, STS 99 is intended to allow researchers to compare and contrast ideas, and other participants to provide feedback on relevance, to enhance concept and technology transfer. Further, we hope that STS 99 encourages more direct cooperation and collaboration by bringing TS researchers in direct contact, and revealing shared and complementary approaches. More than a single event, STS is to be seen as an initiativ...|$|E

The Center {{is dedicated to the}} study of strong interactions, including spin physics, lattice QCD and RHIC physics through the nurturing {{of a new generation of}} young physicists. During the fast year, the Center had only a Theory Group. In the second year, an Experimental Group was also established at the Center. At present, there are seven Fellows and nine post dots in these two groups. During the third year, we started a new Tenure Track Strong Interaction Theory RHIC Physics Fellow Program, with six positions in the academic year 1999 - 2000; this program will increase to include eleven theorists in the next academic year, and, in the year after, also be extended to experimental physics. In addition, the Center has an <b>active</b> <b>workshop</b> program on strong interaction physics, about ten workshops a year, with each workshop focused on a specific physics problem. Each workshop speaker is encouraged to select few of the most important transparencies from his or her presentation, accompanied by a page of explanation. This material is collected at the end of the workshop by the organizer to form proceedings, which can therefore be available within a short time.

40|$|Important {{new data}} that throw {{light on the}} history of Thebes (Greece) and its {{terracotta}} production, was collected from the excavations of a large cemetery 2 km north-east of the ancient city. The study of terracotta figurines shows {{that at the end of}} 4 th c. and in the first half of 3 rd c. B. C. there are <b>active</b> <b>workshops</b> in Thebes. The Theban craftsmen reveal a high degree of skill to create or to modify types that will be in use for long time. The large output of the local terracotta workshop seems to have been intended mostly to cover local demand; although it was included in a circuit of products dealing mainly with central Greece and Egypt. After the second half of the 3 rd c. B. C., in which we see the decrease of the funerary use of clay figurines, the first half of the 2 nd century apparently marks a revival of this trend. It is noteworthy that together with the survival of LC types we have new types or reworking of old types to include adjustments due to the local tastes or to the style circulating in that period. The Theban workshops seems to have closed their activity at the end of this period for historical reasons that the recent excavations in Thebes are going to clarify...|$|R

40|$|Background: Occupational {{diseases}} are under reported. Targeted education of occupational physicians (OPs) may improve their rate of reporting occupational diseases. Aim: To study {{the effectiveness of}} an <b>active</b> multifaceted <b>workshop</b> aimed at improving OPs' reporting of occupational diseases. Methods: We undertook a comparative study with 112 OPs in the intervention group and 571 OPs as comparisons. The intervention was a 1 -day workshop. Measurements of occupational disease reporting activity in both groups in 6 -month periods {{before and after the}} intervention were collected via the national registration system. Measurements of OPs' knowledge, self-efficacy and satisfaction were made in the intervention group. Differences between the groups and predictive factors for reporting were subsequently analysed statistically. Results: The percentage of reporting OPs after the intervention was significantly higher in the intervention group compared to the comparison group at 19 versus 11 % (P < 0. 01). No differences were found in the average number of reported occupational diseases per reporting physician after the intervention: 3. 7 (SD 5. 37) versus 3. 4 (SD 4. 56) (not significant). The self-efficacy score was a predictive factor for reporting occupational diseases (P < 0. 05). Measurements of knowledge and self-efficacy increased significantly (both parameters P < 0. 001) and remained after half a year. Satisfaction was high (7. 85 of 10). Conclusions: An <b>active,</b> multifaceted <b>workshop</b> on occupational diseases is effective in increasing the number of physicians reporting occupational diseases. Self-efficacy measures are a predictive factor for such reportin...|$|R
40|$|In {{the area}} of Marathon in Attica, in the modern {{municipality}} of Nea Makri, part of an ancient cemetery was excavated. The rescue excavations conducted by the 2 nd Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities during 1995 in the area opposite of the American base, in proximity to the coast, revealed about 18 graves of the Geometric, late Archaic and Classical periods. A few more burials were excavated {{in the same area}} in 1985. Among the funerary vases from the necropolis, two fragmentary amphorae of monumental dimensions, as those already known from the Athenian cemeteries of the middle 8 th century BC are treated separately. The first of the two vases protrudes an Athenian provenance, probably the product of one of the <b>active</b> <b>workshops</b> of {{the early stages of the}} Late Geometric I period. The second amphora is decorated with a large prothesis scene placed on the body of the vase. The treatment of the iconographic scene in combination with the technical characteristics of the vase (shape, clay, slip) allowed the attribution of the vase, for the first time here, to a local pottery workshop of the Late Geometric period. The identification of a local pottery workshop of the Geometric period at Marathon is the cause of some thoughts concerning the relation of the pottery workshops of the Attic countryside that seem to be active during the Late Geometric period with the known and well established Athenian workshops. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
