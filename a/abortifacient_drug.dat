40|$|Purpose: To {{review the}} {{association}} of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in individuals manifesting thalidomide embry-opathy and Möbius sequence and compare them with three new studies in which ASD was also associated with ocular and systemic malformations: (1) a Swedish study of individuals with CHARGE association (Coloboma, Heart, choanal Atresia, developmental or growth Retardation, Genital anomaly, and Ear involvement); (2) a Swedish study of Goldenhar syndrome; and (3) Brazilian Möbius syndrome (sequence) study. Methods: In the Swedish CHARGE study, 31 patients met the inclusion criteria (3 + or 4 of the common characteristics of the CHARGE syndrome). The same team of investigators also evaluated 20 Swedish patients with Goldenhar syndrome. In the Brazilian Möbius study, 28 children with a diagnosis of Möbius sequence were studied; some children {{had a history of}} exposure during their mother’s pregnancy to the <b>abortifacient</b> <b>drug</b> misoprostol in an unsuccessful abortion attempt Results: In the CHARGE study, five patients had the more severe autism disorder and five had autistic-like condition. In the Goldenhar study, two had autism disorder and one had autistic-like condition. In the Brazilian Möbius study, the systemic findings of the misoprostol-exposed and misoprostol-unexposed patients were almost undistinguishable, and ASD was present in both groups (autism disorder in five and autistic-like condition in three). Conclusion: Autism spectrum disorder has been reported in two conditions with known early pregnancy exposure to the teratogenic agents thalidomide and misoprostol. In the Brazilian Möbius study, autism also occurred in both the miso-prostol-exposed and misoprostol-unexposed groups.

40|$|Objetivo: verificar a associação entre o uso de abortivos durante o primeiro trimestre de gestação e a ocorrência de defeitos congênitos em recém-nascidos (RN). Métodos: estudo caso-controle com amostra de 800 nativivos, em maternidade pública de Salvador, Bahia, pelo período de um ano. Eram selecionados os seis primeiros nascimentos ocorridos em um só dia, sendo feitas consultas aos prontuários para verificação do registro de defeitos congênitos. Nos casos positivos eram observados os bebês afetados e realizada entrevista com as puérperas para o levantamento de antecedentes gestacionais e genéticos, utilizando questionário como instrumento de coleta de dados. Posteriormente os dados eram inseridos em programa de computador Epi-Info 5. 0 para análise estatística. Resultados: as puérperas estudadas foram predominantemente de classe socioeconômica baixa (74, 8 %), sem escolaridade ou apenas 1 º grau (61, 1 %). A taxa geral de defeitos congênitos foi de 4, 7 %. Entre as puérperas, 16 % relataram a ingestão de substâncias abortivas no primeiro trimestre de gestação e 10, 9 % destas tiveram filhos com malformações. Nas crianças em que as mães não utilizaram abortivos essa incidência foi 3, 6 %. Os principais agentes usados como abortifacientes foram os chás medicinais e o {{misoprostol}} (Cytotec). O alumã (Vermonia baiensis Tol) e o espinho cheiroso (Kanthoxilum shifolium Lam) foram as plantas mais utilizadas inadequadamente, pois não apresentam propriedades abortivas, justificando assim a sua ineficácia. Conclusão: o presente estudo evidencia que tentativas de abortamento são práticas muito usuais em populações de baixa renda. Revela ainda que o uso de abortivos provoca um percentual significativo de malformações congênitas em bebês nativivos. Purpose: {{to verify}} the association {{of the use of}} abortifacient drugs during the first 3 months of gestation with the occurrence of congenital malformations in live births. Patients and Methods: population-based case-control study through selection of the first six live births on a day, over the period of a year, at a public maternity in Salvador, Bahia, with a total of 800 cases. Studies were performed through investigation of birth records in the search of congenital malformation data, observation of selected malformed newborns, followed by interview with the mothers for collection of anamnesis data, by application of a questionnaire. Later on data were statistically evaluated by Epi-Info 5. 0 software. Results: puerperae came from a low socialeconomic class (74. 8 %), without any or almost any schooling (61. 1 %). The general percentage of birth defects was estimated at 4. 7 %. Out of 800 puerperae, 16 % reported <b>abortifacient</b> <b>drug</b> intake during the first 3 months of gestation and 10. 9 % of them had malformed babies. This incidence was 3. 6 % in children whose mothers denied the intake of any abortifacient drugs. Agents most commonly taken in those unsuccessful abortive attempts were misoprostol (Cytotec) and herbs, specially "alumã" (Vermonia baiensis Tol) and "espinho cheiroso" (Kanthoxilum shifolium Lam), which, according to the literature, do not really have any abortive effect. Conclusion: the study revealed the extension of intentional miscarriage in a low income population and showed that the occurrence of birth defects could be related to gestational exposure to misoprostol and herbal medicine intake...|$|E

Other scholars have concluded that early Christians considered abortion a sin at all stages; though there is disagreement over their thoughts on what type of sin it was and how grave a sin it was held to be. Some early Christians believed that the embryo did not have a soul from conception, and consequently opinion was divided as to whether early abortion was murder or ethically equivalent to murder. Early Christian texts nonetheless condemned abortion without distinction: Luker mentions the Didache, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, and Saint Basil.

5000|$|Most of the {{indigenous}} peoples around the world, {{as well as from}} European antiquity {{all the way to the}} Middle Ages contain linkages to point to the use of plant based oral contraceptives. This type of contraception is currently regaining attention in some scientific and historian circles. Plant-based contraceptives and <b>abortifacient</b> <b>drugs</b> may have been widely used in antiquity and the Middle Ages, but much knowledge about ancient forms of medicinal contraception appears to have vanished. Because of this, plant based oral contraception in history is often contested, though archaeological and written record shows evidence that drugs were a reliable way to prevent conception or even induce early-term abortions. Their absence from many historical texts could be due to their likely presence in anti-fertility lore which was almost exclusively limited to midwives as professionals. These bits of folklore, combined with archaeological written records, allude to what was likely a “thriving oral culture of contraception.” Silphium was a plant that grew in the hills near the Greek city-state of Cyrene, Libya located in North Africa. This plant was one example of an oral contraceptive in ancient times, based partly on Pliny's statement that it could be used [...] "to promote the menstrual discharge" [...] but since then has been harvested into extinction.|$|R

40|$|In April 2008, the Yale Daily News {{published}} an article introducing Yale University fine arts student Aliza Shvarts's senior undergraduate art project. In the article, Shvarts announced {{that as part of}} her project she had been privately artificially inseminating herself every month during a nine-month period, and performing self-induced miscarriages by ingesting <b>abortifacient</b> <b>drugs</b> each month. The announcement ignited a national controversy, sparking university protests and 'pro-life' outcries across internet communities. Ultimately, the Yale School of Art banned the project from being exhibited. No feminist made an immediate defence of Shvarts's work. Through an in-depth exploration of Shvarts's art project, this essay aims to critically interrogate the politics of reproduction and the rhetoric of futurity in relation to a woman's social and symbolic positioning in a culture that places heterosexual reproduction and the institution of family at the heart of future. I argue that Shvarts's project was an attempt to explore how art could be a means to empty the realm of femininity of its symbolic 'function' within a patriarchal order. By means of her radical refusal of reproduction, manifested in a series of repeated abortions, she staged a resistance to the patriarchal symbolic positioning of a woman – the positioning within which a woman's life is intelligible insofar as it follows the pre-determined reproductive narrative of 'natural' womanhood (birth, marriage, motherhood and death) – so that a multitude of new narratives and possibilities could be birthed. I argue that Shvarts {{is the author of the}} possibility for imagining the future that is not mapped in advance for a woman – the future in which she is not an 'object' of reproduction but an 'author'. Drawing on Jack J. Halberstam's concept of 'shadow feminism' and Lee Edelman's 'reproductive futurism', I will also suggest that Shvarts's performance provides an invaluable reflection on the queer and feminist politics of negativity. This is the politics that is against assimilation into a heteronormative social order, ideological naturalisation of a woman's body, and a vision of the future as something always bound up with linear descendancy...|$|R
