5|$|In 2010, Saran {{made her}} Malayalam debut with Pokkiri Raja, {{in which she}} {{appeared}} opposite Mammootty and Prithviraj. The film was declared a super hit in the first week, breaking the record in Malayalam cinema for opening week gross income, {{though it was not}} received well critically. It was said of Saran that <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was look pretty. She then enacted her first lead role in a Telugu film after five years, in the commercially successful action-comedy Don Seenu opposite Ravi Teja, where she plays the sister of a mobster. In the opinion of some critics, she stole the show with her dances and romantic scenes.|$|E
25|$|Shirley's biggest {{trademark}} was her hair, {{which was}} also the subject of rumors. A rumor circulated that she wore a wig. More than once, fans yanked her hair to test the theory. She later said she wished <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was wear a wig. The nightly process she went through {{in the setting of}} her curls was tedious and grueling, with once a week vinegar rinses burning her eyes. Rumors also spread about her hair color, namely that she wasn't a natural blonde. During the making of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, news spread {{that she was going to}} do extended scenes without her trademark curls. During production, she also caught a cold, which caused her to miss a couple of days. As a result, a false report originated in Britain that all of her hair was cut off.|$|E

6000|$|... "Twould give grave offence {{to leave}} the lady, without knowing <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> say. The answer now {{concerns}} you, worthy Alderman; and the rattan will do its turn, in your hand, {{as well as in}} that of another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is--it is {{my cousin}} Ginevra. Every time <b>she</b> <b>has</b> leave <b>to</b> visit Mrs. Cholmondeley she calls here, and {{whenever}} she finds me alone {{she begins to}} talk about her admirers. Love, indeed! You should hear <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> say about love." ...|$|R
50|$|On {{their honeymoon}} the two share their various family histories, Andrew's {{mother and father}} having {{separated}} and left him {{to the care of}} an aunt who <b>has</b> sacrificed <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> get him to where he is, and Celia's father having died in the attack on Pearl Harbor.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it is {{so lovely}} I don't know what to say!" [...] and Jill put up both arms, as words failed her, and {{grateful}} kisses were <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> offer.|$|E
60|$|I fancied that I {{understood}} {{the word and}} action. It meant the offering of herself, and <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had,</b> <b>to</b> be at Zenobia's disposal. But the latter would not take it thus.|$|E
6000|$|Josie {{was a good}} listener. She did not {{interrupt}} Mary Louise, but let her say <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say {{concerning this}} interesting matter. When her friend paused for lack of words, Josie remarked: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{sometimes}} think," [...] almost whispered Marian, [...] "that {{it is not}} he, poor boy, {{whose eyes}} are {{the worst in the}} house; but Mrs. Lyddell's head has been so full of Johnny, and Caroline, and <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do, that <b>she</b> will not see anything amiss with Lionel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Skim her--and learn all. The {{table of}} {{contents}} is SO short.... You see, in the first place, she is extremely 'exclusive'; she prides herself on her 'exclusiveness': it, and her shoddy title, are probably <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> pride herself upon, and she works them both hard. She is a sham great lady." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said he, [...] "if that estimable {{young woman}} wants {{to catch a}} sight of them, <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do is to step along lively, for at this present moment she is walking over the field-path {{straight}} to this house, and what is more, she is wearing her bonnet and carrying a parasol." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>All</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do {{at present}} was {{to listen to}} Miss Bracy, who was sure that Mrs. Rivers thought Mary and Blanche were not improved, and was afraid she was ungrateful for all the {{intended}} kindness to her sister.|$|E
60|$|Could she {{with her}} hands fight {{the face of the}} earth, beat the hills in their places? Yet her breast wanted to fight, to fight the whole world. And these two small hands were <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do it with.|$|E
60|$|She {{had seen}} Miss Scott hand her bunch to a meek little governess {{who had been}} forgotten, and this was <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> offer {{in return for the}} {{kindness}} which is so sweet to poor girls whose sensitive pride gets often wounded by trifles like these.|$|E
50|$|Else {{also runs}} a massage parlor {{out of her}} own home, and {{sometimes}} causes serious injury to her clients. Inexplicably, she is frequently mistaken for a prostitute. <b>She</b> also <b>has</b> an eternal relationship with her bathroom scale, and as a quite overweight woman, these <b>have</b> a tendency <b>to</b> break. Sometimes, <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do is cast a shadow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Better, but {{not out of}} her room. It {{has been}} a {{tolerable}} state of things of late. Not a creature to speak to, except, now and then, Clara coming down to maunder and sigh over <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do, and my father, who has been thoroughly in a rage about Elliot. Do you know about all that, Marian?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{wanted to}} tell her that if I could do {{anything}} at <b>all,</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> only <b>to</b> command.|$|R
60|$|Lady Underhill, {{having said}} <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say, {{recovered}} {{her breath and}} began to say it again. Frequent iteration {{was one of her}} strongest weapons. As her brother Edwin, who was fond of homely imagery, had often observed, she could talk the hind-leg off a donkey.|$|E
60|$|Therese fetched another deep {{sigh and}} raising her eyes {{looked at me}} with great attention. I {{preserved}} an inscrutable expression, for I wanted to hear <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> tell me of Rita. I watched her with the greatest anxiety composing her face into a cheerful expression.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not on your life," [...] {{he laughed}} jubilantly. [...] "All she'd done {{was to put}} a washtub on the ground square under the {{demijohn}}. Then she got out her old rifle an' shot the demijohn to smithereens, an' <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was lap the whisky outa the tub." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mrs. Doctor, dear, it does NOT {{seem to me}} fair. Here is me, {{who never}} said a word against the men, and I cannot get married nohow. And there is Cornelia Bryant, who is never done abusing them, and <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do is to reach out her hand and pick one up, as it were. It is a very strange world, Mrs. Doctor, dear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense! How do {{you suppose}} our dear little Queen in England would get on with <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do, if <b>she</b> were to give in like that? We must none of us give up in these days. Help me to put on my things; I am going to church, and then I shall take a long rest {{before we go to}} the hospital." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is little}} she will care for you now," [...] I {{said to the}} fellow; [...] "I know the sort of woman; her intellectuals (which are <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> {{distinguish}} her from the brutes) are so imperfectly developed {{that she will be}} a crazy thing about that boy for the next three years. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> no longer occasion for you, my dear sir; you are like a picture painted out." ...|$|R
60|$|Pauline, to {{whom the}} {{brothers}} now looked, shook her head. Never before, she said, had she occasion to trouble her brain about a light. When she wanted one in England, <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was to call for one, or strike a match. What was {{to be done in}} their present circumstances she had not the smallest conception.|$|E
60|$|Putting a tray on {{the little}} table, the good soul set forth <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> give, and offered it with such hospitable warmth that Christie ate and drank with unaccustomed appetite, {{finishing}} off deliciously with a kiss from baby before she was borne away by her mother to the back bedroom, where peace soon reigned.|$|E
60|$|These {{directions}} {{she still}} had. <b>All</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do now was to embody {{them in the}} secret orders which Gaston de Stainville would hand over to the Commander of Le Monarque. Further orders would be anent getting the prince and his friends on board, and the route to be taken homeward, the better to ensure their safety.|$|E
25|$|The World Champs are the Croatian's {{first major}} {{championship}} outdoors since Daegu 2011. On 27 August, {{she makes it}} to the finals and there, two days later, earned the silver medal behind Russia's Mariya Lasitskene (former Kuchina) who beats her on countbacks (Vlašić as one miss at 1,92 m). To her, the silver medal feels like gold after <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> go through in the recent years, and more specifically recalling she could not walk for days in early July.|$|R
60|$|Caterina was {{thinking}} of the near future--of the wedding that was so soon <b>to</b> come--of <b>all</b> <b>she</b> would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> live through in the next months.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Serena Serghetti {{tries to}} enter the Alignment's ranks {{in order to gain}} their trust & expose their {{remaining}} leaders <b>to</b> the world- <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do is deliver both globes to the Castle of the Grand Master in time for the Summit Meeting, where the Alignment will convene in secret {{for the first time in}} centuries- but Conrad's reappearance screws up her plans, as well as his when he sacrifices his own life to keep her safe & uncover the Alignment's plans for Armagheddon.|$|R
60|$|She {{was going}} to solve the problem in a way that seemed to her very simple. Her mind had never yet bowed to any {{obligation}} apart from personal love and reverence; she had no keen sense of any other human relations, and <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> obey now was the instinct to sever herself from the man she loved no longer.|$|E
60|$|She sat {{crushed and}} obliterated in a {{darkness}} {{that was the}} border of death. She realised how all her life she had been drawing nearer and nearer to this brink, {{where there was no}} beyond, from which one had to leap like Sappho into the unknown. The knowledge of the imminence of death was like a drug. Darkly, without thinking at all, she knew that she was near to death. She had travelled all her life along the line of fulfilment, and it was nearly concluded. She knew <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> know, she had experienced <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> experience, she was fulfilled in a kind of bitter ripeness, there remained only to fall from the tree into death. And one must fulfil one's development to the end, must carry the adventure to its conclusion. And the next step was over the border into death. So it was then! There was a certain peace in the knowledge.|$|E
6000|$|No {{one came}} {{out by the}} little door she was told; <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{do would be to}} keep out of sight when the ringers came in before the {{afternoon}} service. She knew the way, and was soon close to Mary Sedhurst's grave. [...] "Ah! why was he not constant to her," [...] she thought; [...] "and oh! why has he deserted me in my need?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Put {{it before}} her? How can I put it before her when <b>all</b> <b>she</b> would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say would be: 'You, YOU, you base one, who made me--?'" ...|$|R
50|$|Fonzie {{enters and}} is greeted by Richie. Richie tries to talk Fonzie out of wrestling at the match {{due to his}} bad knee, but Fonzie will have none of it. He reenters Arnold's, where Pinky is giving Joanie boy advice and tells her that <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do to dance with Chachi is {{listen to the music}} ("Message in the Music"). Pinky then asks Fonzie to slow it down on the jukebox and asks him to compete in the wrestling match. Everyone rejoices when he says yes.|$|R
5000|$|Lives {{start to}} unravel during an eventful dinner party {{when the group}} are forced to face their issues head on. For one couple, vicar Dan (David Conolly) and his wife Emma (Joanna Pecover) {{are faced with the}} revelation that one of them has been having an affair with the evening’s hostess Kate (Miranda Hart). Worst of <b>all</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> in turn face her mother (Joan Blackham) who drops in to “help out”. Drug-fueled sex, lustful longings and how to make cous-cous—are there some things a girl shouldn't share with her mother? ...|$|R
