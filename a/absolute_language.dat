Later in the 1980s and in the 1990s workers will be defined by intellectuals as irrational, misguided and even dangerous, because of their [...] "illegitimate" [...] opposition to the [...] "necessary", [...] "correct" [...] and [...] "rational" [...] economic policies, pursued especially by the new post-1989 liberal establishment and couched by it in the <b>absolute</b> <b>language</b> of science, not in relative terms of a political debate. Ost concludes that the liberals [...] "got it wrong" [...] and made [...] "their fatal error": they drove the critics toward an ideological and intolerant Right. The abandonment, rejection and exclusion would thus push many workers, labor activists and others into right-wing populism and religious nationalism (the marginalized in 1989 but later resurgent illiberal camp), while the liberal elite would pay with a steady erosion of its authority. The liberals' approach revealed [...] "a fundamental misunderstanding of what democracy is and how best to consolidate it". In the end, the liberals misguided in their belief that [...] "liberal democracy could be grounded solely in private property" [...] ignored in the post-1989 discourse not only the material, but also the symbolic and emotional levels. They adopted a hostile attitude toward their labor base and had thus [...] "squandered their moral and political authority", making it possible for the politically illiberal populist Right to fill the resulting societal vacuum and flourish (by proffering only fictitious enemies and symbolic appeasement).|$|E

5000|$|Largely {{considered}} Vertov's lone masterpiece, Man with a Movie Camera is {{the greatest}} example of Kino-Eye. According to Vertov, it required more work than his previous Kino-Eye films because of its complexity in both filming and editing. Without words or titles, it relies solely on the visual language of film to tell its story, departing wholly from the languages of theatre and literature that the kinoks believed had infiltrated cinema. Vertov thought of the film as the culmination of his previous Kino-Eye features, writing:"The film Man with a Movie Camera represents AN EXPERIMENT IN THE CINEMATIC TRANSMISSION of visual phenomena WITHOUT THE HELP OF INTERTITLES (a film without intertitles) WITHOUT THE HELP OF A SCRIPT (a film without a script) WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE THEATRE (a film without actors, without sets, etc.). This new experimental work by Kino-Eye is directed towards {{the creation of an}} authentically international <b>absolute</b> <b>language</b> of cinema - ABSOLUTE KINOGRAPHY - {{on the basis of its}} complete separation from the language of theatre and literature."Unashamedly avant-garde, Man with a Movie Camera captures every day actions such as getting out of bed, washing, and even giving birth. It is in the editing and cutting together of these fragments that meaning is made. Hicks writes, [...] "In its very form Man with a Movie Camera is a defence of documentary. For Vertov, however, the defense of documentary was inextricable from the defence of the integrity of cinema itself, since documentary was its purest, least theatrical form." [...] To Vertov, the film was his fullest physical manifestation of the theory of Kino-Eye. Responding to critics and those trying to intellectualize the film, he wrote, [...] "In fact, the film is only the sum of the facts recorded on film." [...] This simplicity and goal of objectivity is the foundation of Kino-Eye.|$|E

40|$|Background – {{children}} with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) {{have an increased}} risk to develop challenging behaviour {{and the question is}} whether this risk is partly due to the language deficits most {{children with}} ASD have to face. Methods – data were collected on the expressive and pragmatic language abilities en internalising and externalising behaviour problems of 23 children with ASD (8; 2 – 13; 5 year; 3 girls and 23 boys). The relationship between those variables was examined using several multiple regression analyses, in which age and gender were the possible moderating factors. Results – a positive association was found between expressive language and externalising behaviour problems. A negative association was found between pragmatic language and internalising behaviour problems. No independent association was found between expressive and internalising behaviour problems, but taking in account pragmatic language, a positive association was found. There was no influence for age and gender. Discussion – an association was found between language and behaviour problems in children with ASD. The nature of the relationship en possible causality need to be further examined though.

40|$|Sentence {{alignment}} is {{an important}} step in the preparation of parallel data. Most aligners do not perform very well when the input is a noisy, rather than a highlyparallel, document pair. Evaluating aligners under noisy conditions would seem to require creating an evaluation dataset by manually annotating a noisy document for gold-standard alignments. Such a costly process hinders our ability to evaluate an aligner under various types and levels of noise. In this paper, we propose a new evaluation framework for sentence aligners, which is particularly suitable for noisy-data evaluation. Our approach is unique as it requires no manual labeling, instead relying on small parallel datasets (already at the disposal of MT researchers) to generate many evaluation datasets that mimic a variety of noisy conditions. We use our framework to perform a comprehensive comparison of three aligners under noisy conditions. Furthermore, our framework facilitates the fine-tuning of a state-of-the-art sentence aligner, allowing us to substantially increase its recall rates by anywhere from 5 % to 14 % (<b>absolute)</b> across several <b>language</b> pairs. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe role of {{awareness}} in language learning has gained strength {{with the increasing}} popularity of cognitive approaches in the field. The Noticing Hypothesis- any form should be noticed in the input and registered consciously to be acquired (Schmidt, 1990, 2001) - contradicts the earlier popular approaches to language acquisition which focus on subconscious processes (Krashen, 1981). The extend that awareness and noticing {{play a role in}} language learning is important especially for practitioners to design more effective teaching courses and programs. The implications of related studies will also be determinant of teacher and learner roles in the learning process. Therefore, this paper presents a review of the related studies on ‘noticing’ and discusses the important concepts of the Noticing Hypothesis. With the purpose of detecting and refuting the contradictory arguments in these studies and clarifying the conceptual issues, the paper adopts a critical perspective. Highly polarized view of the involvement of either conscious or unconscious processes in learning is in the centre of discussion in the paper.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} use of biblical interpretation in the Book of Daniel. It demonstrates the spectrum in which Daniel uses older scriptural texts such as Genesis and Ezekiel {{in order to accomplish}} the theological concord with the earlier scriptural traditions of ancient Israel. Methodologically, the dissertation embraces the theory of literary allusion. The allusions in Daniel to Genesis 10 - 11 characterize Daniel as a literature of resistance to human imperialism. The motif of universal <b>language,</b> <b>absolute</b> dominion, symbolic construction for imperialism, collective power of human politics, and divine triumph over Babel, resurface to highlight the strong consonance between Genesis and Daniel. The allusions in Daniel to Ezekiel demonstrate that Ezekiel 1 - 3 is the greatest source of apocalyptic texts in Daniel 7 and 10 - 12. The anthropomorphic manifestation of God in Daniel’s apocalyptic vision harks back to that in Ezekiel’s prophetic vision. Both magnificent characters in Daniel 7 (the one like a son of man) and 10 (the heavenly revealer) are portrayed as liminal figures. The son of man figure alludes to the Glory of YHWH (Ezekiel 1), Israel (Daniel 7), the maskilim (Daniel 11 - 12), and Ezekiel (Ezekiel 1 - 3). The heavenly figure in Daniel 10 alludes to Ezekiel 1, evoking the Glory of YHWH (Ezekiel 1), the maskilim (Daniel 11 - 12), and the four cherubim (Ezekiel 1). The links between the maskilim and Prophet Ezekiel show how Daniel 10 - 12 reshapes Ezekiel 1 - 3 to portray the critical period under Antiochus IV Epiphanes...|$|R
40|$|Roald Dahl, {{being one}} of the most {{well-known}} authors of Britain, has risen to prominence in children’s literature. By his works and unique style, Dahl managed to transcend the borders of adulthood and address his works to both adults and children. As a winner of “Millennium Children's Book Award and Blue Peter Book Award” for his famous work: “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” Dahl’s impact on his audience and his universal success were highly appreciated. In this study, Dahl’s works “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” and“Matilda” are investigated to relate societal misconceptions and human flaws. The research question is chosen to observe children’s literature and its role in pointing out such misconceptions. The research question is handled in two parts: tools and targets. The devices that Dahl uses to convey his criticism are themes, <b>language,</b> <b>absolute</b> distinctions and characterization. Such tools, by defining and portraying human blemishes target a criticism on adults, materialism and insatiability. Although the works chosen belong to children’s literature, the criticism they raise is attributed to societal issues with the messages and lessons conveyed. Regardless of Dahl’s using a simple and plain language, such depictions, characterization and themes, he creates a vast distinction and irony among concepts. Such satirical and ironic tone decries the intricate world of adulthood, while dispraising the perpetual pursuit of physical matter and its being the pioneer concept in life.
