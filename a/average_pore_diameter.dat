50|$|Most {{produced}} CDCs {{exhibit a}} prevalence of micropores (< 2 nm) and mesopores (between 2 and 50 nm), with specific distributions affected by carbide precursor and synthesis conditions. Hierarchic porosity {{can be achieved}} by using polymer-derived ceramics with or without utilizing a templating method. Templating yields an ordered array of mesopores in addition to the disordered network of micropores.It has been shown that the initial crystal structure of the carbide is the primary factor affecting the CDC porosity, especially for low-temperature chlorine treatment. In general, a larger spacing between carbon atoms in the lattice correlates with an increase in the <b>average</b> <b>pore</b> <b>diameter.</b> As the synthesis temperature increases, the <b>average</b> <b>pore</b> <b>diameter</b> increases, while the pore size distribution becomes broader. The overall shape and size of the carbide precursor, however, is largely maintained and CDC formation is usually referred to as a conformal process.|$|E

The primary {{properties of}} interest for HFMs are <b>average</b> <b>pore</b> <b>diameter</b> and pore distribution, measurable via a technique known as porosimetry, a feature of several laboratory instruments used for measuring pore size. Pore diameter can also be measured via a technique known as evapoporometry, in which evaporation of 2-propanol through the pores of a membrane is related to pore-size via the Kelvin equation. Depending on the diameters of pores in an HFM, scanning electron microscopy or transmission electron microscopy {{can be used to}} yield a qualitative perspective of pore size.|$|E
5000|$|Common to each {{of these}} methods is the use of a spinneret, a device {{containing}} a needle through which solvent is extruded and an annulus through which a polymer solution is extruded. As the polymer is extruded through the annulus of the spinneret, it retains a hollow cylindrical shape. As the polymer exits the spinneret, it solidifies into a membrane through a process known as phase inversion. The properties of the membrane -such as <b>average</b> <b>pore</b> <b>diameter</b> and membrane thickness- can be finely tuned by changing the dimensions of the spinneret, temperature and composition of [...] "dope" [...] (polymer) and [...] "bore" [...] (solvent) solutions, length of air gap (for dry-jet wet spinning), temperature and composition of the coagulant, as well as the speed at which produced fiber is collected by a motorized spool. Extrusion of the polymer and solvent through the spinneret can be accomplished either through the use of gas-extrusion or a metered pump. Some of the polymers most commonly used for fabricating HFMs include cellulose acetate, polysulfone, polyethersulfone, and polyvinylidene fluoride.|$|E
