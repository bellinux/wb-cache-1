40|$|We {{present an}} {{investigation}} of the release and transport of lunar polar crater volatiles onto topside regions surrounding the cold traps. The volatiles are liberated via surface energization processes associated with the harsh space environment, including solar wind plasma sputtering and impact vaporization. We find that some fraction of these volatiles can migrate from crater floors onto topside regions (those regions directly adjacent to and above the polar crater floors), and that these surrounding terrains should contain a sampling of the material originating within the crater itself. It is concluded that the nature of the volatile content on crater floors can be obtained by sampling the surface volatiles that have migrated or "spilled out" onto the adjacent terrain. This "spillage" effect could make human or robotic prospecting for crater resources significantly easier, since an <b>assessment</b> may <b>not</b> <b>require</b> direct entry into the very harsh polar crater environment.

30|$|Given this {{regulatory}} strategy, the United Kingdom {{does not}} provide much MEC risk management guidance, {{and there are no}} official quantitative MOD standards to provide risk-based analysis as to whether a MEC site is safe and MEC-free. On the non-governmental side, there is also no official valid and reliable standardized method which defines MEC risk. Recognizing this gap, the Construction Industry Research and Information Association (CIRIA) has published a UXO guidebook to assist private land owners, developers, and construction industry personnel in understanding the nature of the MEC problem, what their legal responsibilities are, and what to expect when dealing with companies offering UXO desk studies or remediation services [25]. In this guide book, CIRIA suggests a two-step approach: first, a qualitative preliminary risk assessment and then, if necessary, a more detailed risk assessment. However, the final output of the more detailed study can be characterized as a qualitative product and one which relies largely on the subjective judgment of the analysts. Some companies that perform this MEC risk assessment try to provide quantitative analyses based on intrusive geo-physical surveys and other site specific calculations, which enables baseline assessments and calculations of estimated residual risk.

40|$|ABSTRACT This thesis {{examines}} an {{incongruity that}} exists within Florida 2 ̆ 7 s ESOL program. While the curriculum standards direct teachers to 2 ̆ 2 develop and integrate 2 ̆ 2 skills in speaking, listening, reading and writing, student promotions to higher fluency levels are {{based solely on}} reading assessments. Listening assessments are also required to 2 ̆ 2 determine instructional needs, 2 ̆ 2 but writing <b>assessments</b> are <b>not</b> <b>required</b> and, in most cases, not given. As a result, reading is prioritized, writing is subordinated, {{the connection between the}} two skills is broken, and the mutual benefits of integration are lost. Studies conducted during the last 50 years have consistently shown that the integration of reading and writing produces a symbiosis in which students learn to write from reading and learn to read from writing (Olson and Land pp 269, 289). Many educational programs have now adopted an integrated approach to instruction in reading and writing (Common Core 1). Others, like Florida 2 ̆ 7 s ESOL program, tout the idea of integration in the curriculum standards without promoting the practice of integration in the classroom. Without a program of de facto integration, curricular proclamations devolve into hollow platitudes. To reconnect the two skills and restore integration, Florida must require a writing assessment system. This thesis proposes several writing assessments from BEST Literacy, FCAT and the GED program that could be adapted for use. Not only would a writing assessment promote balance and integration, it would better prepare ESOL students to succeed in a world that <b>requires</b> proficiency, <b>not</b> only in reading, but also in writing (Graham 31) ...|$|R

30|$|A risk is {{the product}} of a threat, a {{vulnerability}} and the consequences (i.e., the impact of an incident) [17, 20, 32], and cloud computing is subject to a long list of threats [14] and vulnerabilities [9]. A CC has a special challenge in risk assessment for the cloud when compared to conventional information technology (i.e., other than cloud) customers. CSPs usually keep the locations, architecture and details about the security of their server farms and data centers confidential from CCs. Therefore, it is more difficult to a CC to assess all the threats and vulnerabilities. Additionally, CSPs have to prioritize the issues to solve when risks are realized. A CC has to rely on the autonomic procedures of CSP for managing the infrastructure appropriately according to the CCs’ security dynamics, treating the CCs’ issues in a timely manner, detecting, recovering and reporting the security incidents accurately. These uncertainties increase risk and imply that the CCs have to trust CSP [50], and on its certifications, without further insight into the real time risk landscape. JRTM takes all these facts into account. For risk <b>assessment,</b> JRTM does <b>not</b> <b>require</b> the details about the technical structure, vulnerabilities and threats specific to a CSP.|$|R

PubMed database was searched for the following terms: drug induced liver injury; herb induced liver injury; DILI causality assessment; and HILI causality assessment. The strength of the CIOMS lies in its potential as a standardized scale for DILI and HILI causality assessment. Other advantages include its liver specificity and its validation for hepatotoxicity with excellent sensitivity, specificity and predictive validity, based on cases with a positive reexposure test. This scale allows prospective collection of all relevant data required for a valid causality <b>assessment.</b> It does <b>not</b> <b>require</b> expert knowledge in hepatotoxicity and its results may subsequently be refined. Weaknesses of the CIOMS scale include the limited exclusion of alternative causes and qualitatively graded risk factors.

40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Food Safety Authority, the Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues {{developed}} an opinion on the science to support {{the development of a}} risk assessment scheme of plant (crop) protection products on non-target terrestrial plants (NTTPs). This scientific opinion is largely a literature review on the most up-to-date knowledge of factors influencing phytotoxicity testing and risk assessment of NTTPs. Specific protection goals (SPGs) were defined for off-field, in-field and endangered species. SPGs are closely linked to ecosystem services and functions, and include maintaining provision of water regulation, food web support, aesthetic values, genetic resources and biodiversity. Gaps were identified in standard guidelines currently used in lower tier testing (tier I/II). In these guidelines, tests are conducted at the seedling/juvenile stage using mostly annual crops, and effects are recorded at the juvenile/vegetative stage under greenhouse conditions with plants grown individually or in monoculture. Endpoints measured do not include the overall effect on the whole life cycle (germinating seeds, seedling, juvenile stages, flowering, and seed production and germinability). It is also noted that it is unknown whether the following groups of organisms are covered by the plant risk assessment as it is carried out now: ferns, mosses, liverworts, hornworts, horsetails, lichens or woody species. In terms of exposure, droplet drift is considered {{to be the most important}} factor for off-field emissions to non-target areas. Models are available to calculate loadings from spray drift. Higher tier <b>assessment</b> is <b>not</b> <b>required</b> if the risk based on the tier II level can be managed by risk mitigation measures.

I therefore submitted that a complete theory of argument <b>assessment</b> <b>requires</b> <b>not</b> only an (informal) logic, but also a normative pragmatics [...] a theory of the activity of arguing; and I sketched the outlines of one way of proceeding towards such theory, which I dubbed the "design approach. " All that was rather abstract. In this paper, I propose to carry the project forward by exploring a particular issue in argument assessment: premise adequacy. In the first section, I define the question about premise adequacy that a normative pragmatic theory has to answer. This is the longest section, since I believe that current work is largely stalled because of a failure to ask the right question. In the second section, I summarize two of the undoubtedly many available answers to the question. And in the third section, I briefly address a problem with my account: namely, that premises adequate according to normative pragmatics can seem far from adequate according to logical standards...|$|R
