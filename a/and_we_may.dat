25|$|From {{the tables}} of {{stars on the}} ceiling of the tombs of Rameses VI and Rameses IX it seems that for fixing the hours of the night a man seated on the ground faced the Astrologer in such a {{position}} that the line of observation of the pole star passed over the middle of his head. On the different days of the year each hour was determined by a fixed star culminating or nearly culminating in it, and the position of these stars at the time is given in the tables as in the centre, on the left eye, on the right shoulder, etc. According to the texts, in founding or rebuilding temples the north axis was determined by the same apparatus, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> conclude that it was the usual one for astronomical observations. In careful hands it might give results of a high degree of accuracy.|$|E

In episode 6, we’re going to find out exactly how it happened, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> find out why later." [...] Luna said that the series' take on Reyes' origin story would mix elements from Felipe Smith's original comic with [...] "this new angle that we’re approaching from, but that new angle still draws from the source material." [...] He also felt the episode's approach to revealing the story, by having Reyes tell it to his brother Gabe for the first time, was [...] "really interesting and powerful" [...] and the most surprising aspect of the script for him.|$|E

It actually sounds like the start of something exciting now." [...] One month later, he wrote: [...] "This is something like approach number 561 but it is a great song.

500|$|The New York Evening Post commented in McClellan's obituary, [...] "Probably no {{soldier who}} did so little {{fighting}} {{has ever had}} his qualities as a commander so minutely, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> add, so fiercely discussed." [...] This fierce discussion has continued for over a century. McClellan is usually ranked in the lowest tier of Civil War generals. However, the debate over McClellan's ability and talents remains {{the subject of much}} controversy among Civil War and military historians. He has been universally praised for his organizational abilities and for his very good relations with his troops. They referred to him affectionately as [...] "Little Mac"; others sometimes called him the [...] "Young Napoleon". It has been suggested that his reluctance to enter battle was caused in part by an intense desire to avoid spilling the blood of his men. Ironically, this led to failing to take the initiative against the enemy and therefore passing up good opportunities for decisive victories, which could have ended the war early, and thereby could have spared thousands of soldiers who died in those subsequent battles. Generals who proved successful in the war, such as Lee and Grant, tended to be more aggressive and more willing to risk a major battle even when all preparations were not perfect. McClellan himself summed up his cautious nature in a draft of his memoirs: ...|$|E
