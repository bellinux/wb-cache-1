5|$|On May 24, {{the strikers}} seized the Strong mine on Battle Mountain, which {{overlooked}} {{the town of}} Victor. The next day, at about 9am, 125 deputies arrived in Altman and set up camp {{at the base of}} Bull Hill. As they started to march toward the strikers' camp, miners at the Strong mine blew up the shafthouse, hurling the structure more than 300 feet into the air. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>later,</b> the steam boiler was also dynamited, showering the deputies with timber, iron and cable.

5|$|Around 1:00am (evidence on {{the precise}} time conflicts) on Monday, 8 January, a {{rumbling}} or cracking noise was {{heard from the}} vessel, followed shortly by a huge explosion within its hull. The force of the explosion was seen to blow men from the jetty into the sea. Local residents reported seeing Betelgeuse engulfed in a ball of fire <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>later.</b> A series of further explosions followed, breaking the vessel in half. Much of the oil cargo still on board ignited and this generated temperatures estimated to exceed 1,000°C. The concrete unloading jetty crumbled and firefighters, arriving on the scene from several neighbouring towns, were unable to get near the vessel. The firefighters concentrated their efforts on preventing the fire from spreading to the tanks of the storage farm and on containing the oil spillage. Local families living on the island fled for their lives.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} play of the fourth quarter, Thurman Thomas ran for a 31-yard {{touchdown}} that put the Bills back in front, 19–17. A few possessions later, the Giants drove down to the Bills 4yard line, but were unable to score and {{had to settle for}} a 21-yard field goal by Matt Bahr that gave the Giants a 20–19 lead. Both teams exchanged possessions before the Bills began one final drive. The Bills drove down to the Giants 30-yard line to set up what would be a potentially game-winning 47-yard field goal attempt by Scott Norwood. Just before the kick, ABC showed a graphic indicating that, on grass that season, Norwood had made just 3–of–7 field goals from at least 40yards. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>later,</b> in what became the game's signature moment, Norwood's attempt missed wide right, and the Giants won their second Super Bowl, 20–19.|$|E

40|$|International audienceNF S 31 - 199 {{uses the}} {{concepts}} of discretion. The underlying idea is that ensuring good intelligibility in the scope of communication (the workstation) will reduce the disturbance to distant workstations. Indeed, there is a contradiction inherent in open office areas: voice, useful to transfer knowledge and expertise in the room, {{turns out to be}} <b>a</b> disturbance <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>later,</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> meters away. The complexity of the acoustics of open spaces brought the commission AFNOR S 30 D in 2007 to initiate the drafting of a new document, complementary to NF S 31 - 080. The central themes are that communication and concentration have declined from a model space analysis distinguished in three zones, each corresponding to different acoustic issues: the workstation, the team and the department. The paper proposes the state already in a number of strategies, including the provision of workstations with issues and interactions between employees, reducing the ambient noise level or the mastery of sound propagation in space.

Petherick took it to his office where he was soon visited by Mr Spragg, who was left alone with the will for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments.</b> Two months <b>later,</b> Clode died. When the will was opened, the sheet was blank. Petherick's problem was that Mrs Spragg had the opportunity to change the will, but the will was already in her favour, so she had the opportunity but no motive. George had the motive but no opportunity, as when he had access to the will Mr Petherick was present; thus George had motive but no opportunity.|$|R

5|$|As {{physical}} {{on the ice}} as Bouchard was, he {{was also}} regarded as a clean player and only rarely participated in hockey fights. Immensely strong, most players avoided engaging him in fights and Bouchard more often would be the person to break up combatants. However, it was a fight involving Bouchard {{which led to a}} significant change in the role of referees. During the 1946–47 season, Bouchard became involved in a prolonged and one-sided fight with Boston's Terry Reardon. Due to the fight, Clarence Campbell, president of the NHL, added to the duties of referees; for the first time they had the responsibility of breaking up fights. Then there was the time in March 1947, in a game in Boston, as the Canadiens were coming back onto the ice for the beginning of the third period, a female fan attacked Bouchard spearing him with a hat pin. Bouchard responded by pushing the woman away forcefully. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>later,</b> Boston police were leading Bouchard out to a police car. According to Bouchard, Pat Egan of the Boston Bruins, interceded and talked the police out of the arrest.|$|E

After introducing her new boyfriend, Anthony, to the family, Meg goes on to make out {{with him on the}} family couch, with Lois watching over nearby. Jealous of her daughter's new-found love, she begins hitting on Anthony. Later that day, Lois sends Meg to pick up her grandfather, leaving her all alone with Anthony. The two then begin making out on the couch, but Meg returns to the house only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>later</b> and discovers them. Angry at her mother for ruining her chance at having a normal boyfriend, Meg threatens Lois to lay off of him, pulling out one of her own teeth in frustration. Lois quickly agrees, but is still angry with Peter for continually insulting her. She confronts him about this, and he admits that he was actually embarrassed about his own advancing age, as well as his lack of fitness, and was only insulting Lois in order to distract her from the fact that she could be with a much better-looking man. He apologizes for his behavior, and Lois forgives him.|$|E

The hunting sea lions are returning home, but some are eaten by a great white shark and a killer whale. In the deeper waters, a blue whale feasts on some krill. At twilight, birds are flying back to their nests. At night carnivores are out to hunt on the reef including the mantis shrimp who kills a crab in the movie. In Australia, a Spanish dancer comes out of its home. At day, bottlenose dolphins are leaping on the waves. Meanwhile, a dugong and green sea turtle are feasting on sea grass.

5000|$|Following fitting out, shakedown, {{and initial}} {{exercises}} in the Hampton Roads area, Valencia got underway from the Naval Operating Base, Norfolk, Virginia, at 0938 on 10 February, in company with , bound for the Canal Zone. The ships transited the Panama Canal on the 17th and proceeded on to the Hawaiian Islands, making port at Pearl Harbor on 2 March. Shifting to Honolulu on the 8th, Valencia moored at the Army Transport Dock and loaded a total of 145 officers and enlisted men before getting underway on the 14th for the Marshalls. Escorted by [...] {{up to a point}} 30 miles from Pearl Harbor, the attack cargo ship proceeded independently for the remainder of her passage and arrived at Eniwetok on 22 March. Again traveling singly, Valencia got underway for the southern Carolines three days later and arrived off Ulithi after a week's voyage. However, a typhoon prevented her from entering the harbor; and she steamed away from the storm center at slow speeds until early on the following day, when quieter seas and improved visibility permitted her to reach her destination. She remained at Ulithi from 1 to 13 April, preparing for participation in her first operation. Valencia got underway for Okinawa at 1617 on the 13th, in Division [...] "Able" [...] of Task Group 55.8, in company with , , , , SS Kelso Victory, and SS Typhoon. The four-day passage was highlighted by a suspected submarine contact which sent all ships to general quarters and by the sighting of a stray mine which escort vessels destroyed. Valencia anchored off Hagushi beach, Okinawa, at 0921 on 17 April, commenced discharging cargo at 1815, and ceased at 1945. All ships began making smoke at 2024, upon receipt of an air raid alert, completely covering the anchorage area within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments.</b> Valencia <b>later</b> observed antiaircraft fire from the forces ashore and noted reports of enemy aircraft being in the vicinity two or three times, before securing from general quarters at 2239. Due to prevailing heavy surf conditions, the beaches were closed to landings on the 19th, as high winds kicked up heavy seas which greatly hampered unloading. Heavy swells continued to hinder operations into subsequent days, as rough seas made it difficult to hold boats alongside, sweeping them against the steel hide of the ship. Despite this handicap and two [...] "red alerts" [...] on the evenings of 20 and 21 April, the crew, aided by a force of 83 marines (two officers and 81 enlisted men) managed to unload the ship's cargo by evening on the 21st. Valencia engaged in hoisting in her boats and making ready for sea throughout the night of the 21st and commenced disembarking her marine stevedoring party at 0620 on the 22nd. Another [...] "red alert" [...] interrupted the boat-hoisting process at 0710, but the resumption of the task at 0900, when the [...] "all clear" [...] was sounded, enabled the ship to soon be ready for sea. Accordingly, the ship got underway at 1317 on 22 April for the Marianas in Task Unit 51.29.20. Arriving at Saipan on 1 May, Valencia transferred most of her landing craft (LCVP's, LCPL's, and LCM's) to the boat pool and got underway for Nouméa, New Caledonia, on the 3d. She loaded Army equipment; Navy construction battalion vehicles and equipment; and embarked passengers for destinations on the cargo ship's itinerary. Valencia, got underway at 1508 on 20 May and, between that time and her arrival at Eniwetok on the 30th, called at Guadalcanal and Tulagi, embarking and debarking passengers and picking up new boats. She remained at Eniwetok from 1 to 26 June, awaiting orders, before getting underway for the Marianas. She reached Guam at 1900 on 29 June to unload LCVP's, vehicles, and general cargo at Apra Harbor. The attack cargo ship then shifted to Tanapag Harbor, Guam, to finish unloading before proceeding on to the West Coast of the United States, dropping anchor in San Francisco Bay on 31 July. Valencia remained at anchor until the 9th, when she shifted to Pier 90-B, San Francisco, to begin loading general cargo earmarked for the Philippines. During this time, the war in the Pacific came to an end after Japan, reeling from the steady Allied pounding and two atomic bombs, capitulated on 15 August 1945.|$|R

5|$|The {{script is}} {{characterized}} by numerous inexplicable mood and personality shifts in characters. In analyzing the film's abrupt tone shifts, Greg Sestero highlighted two scenes in particular. In the first scene, Johnny enters the rooftop {{in the middle of}} a tirade about being accused of domestic abuse, only to become abruptly cheerful upon seeing Mark; <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>later,</b> he laughs inappropriately upon learning that a friend of Mark's had been severely beaten. On set, Sestero and first assistant director Sandy Schklair repeatedly tried to convince Wiseau that the line should not be delivered as comical, but Wiseau refused to refrain from laughing. In the second instance, occurring a few scenes later, Mark attempts to kill Peter by throwing him off a roof after Peter expresses his belief that Mark is having an affair with Lisa; just as Peter is about to fall to his death, Mark pulls Peter back over the edge of the roof, apologizes, and the two continue their previous conversation with no acknowledgement of what just occurred.|$|E
5|$|U.S. {{soldiers}} at outpost number 3 called on supporting artillery units at Khâm Đức to fire directly {{at their own}} position {{in an attempt to}} hold off the North Vietnamese, but they too were defeated <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>later.</b> Before sunrise, all seven outposts were firmly in North Vietnamese hands, so U.S. and allied soldiers were placed in a perilous position. The North Vietnamese had occupied all the high ground, from which they could fire down on any support aircraft that tried to resupply the camp or to evacuate people from it. By sunrise, the North Vietnamese moved closer to the Special Forces Camp under the cover of the early morning fog. About one hour before the fog was lifted, an additional 24 B-52 bombers flew in and dropped several hundred tons of bombs on suspected North Vietnamese positions south of Khâm Đức. At 08:20, General Burl W. McLaughlin – commander of the 834th Air Division – was ordered by the U.S. 7th Air Force to make an all-out effort to evacuate the besieged Special Forces Camp at Khâm Đức. By 09:35, the B-52 strikes had clearly failed to stop the North Vietnamese advance, when the camp's south-eastern perimeter was subjected to a massive ground assault.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a {{standard}} {{match for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which then-champion Jeff Jarrett defended the title against A.J.

Styles instead tried to use it, but was also stopped by Ortiz. Styles then broke the guitar, preventing it from {{being used as a}} weapon. Jarrett earned a near-fall after performing Styles' own signature maneuver the Styles Clash. Later, Styles also gained a near-fall after performing Jarrett's own signature maneuver The Stroke. In the final minutes, Monty Brown interfered in the contest, performing the Pounce on Jarrett after Styles pushed him into Brown's path. While Ortiz was distracted by Brown, Styles covered Jarrett for a pin. Another referee came to make the count, however was stopped by Ortiz. This allowed Jarrett to hit Styles in the groin and place him {{on the top of a}} padded turnbuckle. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>later,</b> Ortiz knocked Jarrett out after Jarrett shoved Ortiz, which allowed Styles to move from one turnbuckle to another, he then performed his Spiral Tap maneuver.

5|$|United {{responded with}} their first {{extended}} period of possession of the half, working the ball into wide areas to be crossed into the middle, but Rooney's first couple of attempted centres were well cleared by Piqué. At the third attempt, though, Rooney's cross evaded the Barcelona defence as Touré kicked at thin air; however, it also failed to find a Manchester United player in the penalty area, both Ronaldo and Park going close. After Ronaldo was called offside in the 59thminute – despite appearing to be level with the last defender – Giggs stole the ball mid-way inside the Barcelona half before playing the ball to Ronaldo on the left wing. The Portuguese forward stepped over the ball several times {{in an attempt to}} wrong-foot Puyol, before cutting inside and playing the ball across the edge of the area towards Carrick. A sliding challenge from Busquets prevented a shot, only for the English midfielder to slide the ball out for a Barcelona goal kick while attempting to play Rooney through. Rooney was again played down the right wing <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>later,</b> but his low cross was diverted behind by Piqué, and the resulting corner came to nothing. A left-wing attack from Ronaldo followed, but after cutting inside, he gave the ball away cheaply. Barcelona immediately went on the attack down the other end, but Henry was unable to get past O'Shea and his shot was well saved by Van der Sar low at the near post.|$|E

25|$|Unaware of the {{situation}} on the beaches because of a smoke screen laid by the supporting destroyers, Major General Roberts sent in the two reserve units: the Fusiliers Mont-Royal and the Royal Marines. At 07:00 the Fusiliers under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Dollard Ménard in 26 landing craft sailed towards their beach. They were heavily engaged by the Germans, who hit them with heavy machine gun, mortar and grenade fire, and destroyed them; only a few men managed to reach the town. Those men were then sent in towards the centre of Dieppe and became pinned down under the cliffs and Roberts ordered the Royal Marines to land in order to support them. Not being prepared to support the Fusiliers, the Royal Marines had to transfer from their gunboats and motor boat transports onto landing craft. The Royal Marine landing craft were heavily engaged on their way in with many destroyed or disabled. Those Royal Marines that did reach the shore were either killed or captured.

This happened twice, killing or wounding numbers of people. Around noon, the crowd maddened by these incidents broke through the main gate. Some surrendering defenders were massacred by the crowd in the main courtyard, several being thrown from an upper gallery. Photographs show the courtyard littered with uniformed bodies. Captain Orad de la Torre and Arturo Barea both reported seeing a number of rebel officers who had gathered in a mess room and then shot themselves.

25|$|On September 7, the Shinyō Maru was sailing for Manila in convoy C-076 {{with seven}} other vessels, {{including}} two torpedo boats, two tankers, {{and four other}} medium and small cargo ships. They were sailing two to three miles off the Lanboyan Point of Zamboanga Peninsula {{on the island of}} Mindanao, when the USS Paddle found them. A few days previously, American intelligence had reported the Shinyō Maru to be carrying Japanese soldiers, so they assigned Paddle to search for it. The Paddle, under the command of Captain Byron Nowell, was 10 miles away when the Japanese were first spotted, so Nowell maneuvered forward to attack with torpedoes. A spread of four was then released {{in the direction of the}} Shinyō Maru, which was the leading ship in the convoy. Two of the torpedoes struck, both in the hold, and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> <b>later</b> the Paddle was lined up against one of the cargo ships.

McMillan's coworker, still in the truck, radioed for help at 8:28 PM. According to McMillan, Ahmed Evans—armed with a carbine—walked on the sidewalk across the street and demanded to know if he was stealing cars. McMillan stood and said he had no weapons.
