40|$|Widely used as insulators, capacitors, and {{transducers}} {{in daily}} life, soft dielectrics based on polymers and polymeric gels play {{important roles in}} modern electrified society. Owning to their mechanical compliance, soft dielectrics subject to voltages frequently undergo large deformation <b>and</b> mechanical <b>instabilities.</b> The deformation <b>and</b> <b>instabilities</b> can lead to detrimental failures in some applications of soft dielectrics such as polymer capacitors and insulating gels, but can also be rationally harnessed to enable novel functions such as artificial muscle, dynamic surface patterning, and energy harvesting. According to mechanical constraints on soft dielectrics, we classify their deformation <b>and</b> <b>instabilities</b> into three generic modes: (i) thinning and pull-in, (ii) electro-creasing to cratering, and (iii) electro-cavitation. We then provide a systematic understanding of different modes of deformation <b>and</b> <b>instabilities</b> of soft dielectrics by integrating state-of-the-art experimental methods and observations, theoretical models, and applications. Based on the understanding, a systematic set of strategies to prevent or harness the deformation <b>and</b> <b>instabilities</b> of soft dielectrics for diverse applications are discussed...|$|R

An antioxidant prevented telomere loss <b>and</b> genomic <b>instability</b> in cells with dysfunctional mitochondria, suggesting that reactive oxygen species are mediators linking mitochondrial dysfunction <b>and</b> genomic <b>instability.</b> Further, nuclear transfer protected genomes from telomere dysfunction and promoted cell survival by reconstitution with functional mitochondria.

5|$|As {{the result}} of a polar trough aloft in the central United States, Debra curved northward though its winds shifted southward, defying the earlier {{prediction}} of a bend west-northwest to northwest. A reconnaissance flight determined the location of its center during the mid-morning, and the hurricane made landfall near its peak intensity between Freeport and Galveston, Texas during the evening of July24 local time (0000UTC on July25). It rapidly weakened on July26 while it arched west-northwest, though it maintained tropical characteristics until its dissipation on July28 over central Oklahoma while the system progressed north-northwestward. As it moved inland, moisture along its eastern fringe converged with a front to its northeast, causing heavy rains that were confined to limited areas in northeast Louisiana and southern Arkansas; they eventually traversed east-northeastward over northern Mississippi, Tennessee, and Kentucky. Moisture <b>and</b> <b>instability</b> from Debra led to high-level thunderstorms in Montana and northern Idaho on July31 and August1.|$|E
5|$|By 1258, Henry's {{rule was}} {{increasingly}} unpopular, {{the result of}} the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his Poitevin half-brothers, the Lusignans, as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'état and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the Provisions of Oxford. Henry and the baronial government enacted a peace with France in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for King Louis IX recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government <b>and</b> <b>instability</b> across England continued.|$|E

Within 18 months, with relegation to the Fourth Division a possibility, Mackay resigned. Lou Macari came in, revitalised the side, won the Associate Members' Cup at Wembley, and three weeks later walked out to join Stoke City.

The practice of incarceration of political dissidents in mental hospitals in Eastern Europe and the former USSR damaged the credibility of psychiatric practice in these states and entailed strong condemnation from the international community. Psychiatrists have been involved in human rights abuses in states across the world when the definitions of mental disease were expanded to include political disobedience.
