5|$|In August 2008, {{during the}} Democratic National Convention in Denver, Rage headlined the free Tent State Music Festival to End the War. The band was {{supported}} by Flobots, State Radio, Jello Biafra, and Wayne Kramer. Following the concert, the band, following uniformed veterans from Iraq Veterans <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>War,</b> led the 8,000 attendees to the Denver Coliseum on a 6-mile march to Invesco Field, host of the DNC. After a 4-hour stand-off with police, Obama's campaign agreed to meet with members of Iraq Veterans <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> and hear their demands.|$|E
5|$|In the US in the 1960s, {{military}} clothing {{became increasingly}} common (mostly olive drab rather than patterned camouflage); {{it was often}} found worn by anti-war protestors, initially within groups such as Vietnam Veterans <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> but then increasingly widely {{as a symbol of}} political protest.|$|E

5|$|Among other effects, the Korean War {{galvanised}} NATO {{to develop}} a military structure. Public opinion in countries involved, such as Great Britain, was divided for and <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> Many feared an escalation into a general war with Communist China, and even nuclear war. The strong {{opposition to the war}} often strained Anglo-American relations. For these reasons British officials sought a speedy end to the conflict, hoping to unite Korea under United Nations auspices and withdrawal of all foreign forces.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 15,000 people {{protested the}} fourth {{anniversary of the}} war (March 2007). For the fifth anniversary, the Iraq Body Count Exhibit placed red and white flags in the South Park Blocks, {{signifying}} who had died between the Americans and Iraqis. There was a large fifth-anniversary protest and parade against the Iraq war ("thousands of protesters", March 2008), and {{a high school student}} protest <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> was held in March 2008, with 400 protesters.|$|E
5|$|Capuano voted <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> in Iraq and {{supported}} immediate withdrawal of troops. In 2005 Capuano visited Iraq {{and met with}} military leaders to assess {{the future of the}} region. Capuano is considered {{to be one of the}} biggest supporters in Congress for increasing international aid funding, and has advocated bringing attention to the crisis in Sudan and helped secure funding aimed at assisting developing African nations.|$|E

5|$|From 1962 to 1965, Kistiakowsky {{chaired the}} National Academy of Sciences's Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy (COSEPUP), and was its vice {{president}} from 1965 to 1973. He severed his {{connections with the}} government in protest <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> in Vietnam, and became active in an antiwar organization, the Council for a Livable World, becoming its chairman in 1977.|$|E
5|$|He spoke <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> at the February 2003 {{protest in}} London {{organised}} by the Stop the War Coalition, with police {{saying it was}} the biggest ever demonstration in the UK with about 750,000 marchers, and the organisers estimating nearly a million people participating. In February 2004 and 2008, he was re-elected President of the Stop the War Coalition.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, the Buddhist Uprising {{erupted in}} central Vietnam, {{in which some}} Buddhist leaders fomented civil unrest <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> hoping to end foreign {{involvement}} in Vietnam and end the conflict through a peace deal with the communists. The VNQDD remained implacably opposed to any coexistence with the communists. Members of the VNQDD made alliances with Catholics, collected arms, and engaged in pro-war street clashes with the Buddhists, forcing elements of the ARVN to intervene to stop them.|$|E
25|$|Some {{observers}} {{have noted that}} <b>the</b> protests <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Iraq <b>War</b> have been relatively small-scale and infrequent compared to protests <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Vietnam <b>War.</b> One of <b>the</b> most often cited factors {{for this is the}} lack of conscription.|$|R

5|$|Shoup {{joined the}} Business Executives Move for Vietnam Peace. By 1971, Shoup {{publicly}} endorsed the anti-war veteran group Vietnam Veterans <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>War.</b> As Vietnamization had reduced {{the visibility of}} the anti-war movement, and Shoup's criticism was not as prominent in the public arena. Fulbright and other senators urged the White House {{to listen to his}} criticisms, but Shoup's broader critique of American society and militarism was seen as more extreme than other officers who had simply criticized the strategy of the war.|$|E
5|$|After the US {{strikes on}} Afghanistan and Sudan in 1998, Blair {{released}} a statement supporting the actions; he lent military support to America's 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. In March 2003, the Labour government, fearing Saddam Hussein's alleged access to weapons of mass destruction, participated in the American-led invasion of Iraq. British intervention in Iraq promoted public protest. Crowds numbering 400,000 and more demonstrated in October 2002, and again the following spring. On 15th February 2003, over 1,000,000 people demonstrated <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> in Iraq, and 60,000 marched in Manchester before the Labour Party Conference, with the demonstrators' issues including British occupation of Afghanistan and the forthcoming invasion of Iraq.|$|E
5|$|Harding's Socialist {{opponent}} in the 1920 election, Eugene Debs, was serving a ten-year sentence in the Atlanta Penitentiary for speaking <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> Wilson had refused to pardon him before leaving office. Daugherty met with Debs, and was deeply impressed. There was opposition from veterans, including the American Legion, and also from Florence Harding. The president did not feel he could release Debs until the war was officially over, but once the peace treaties were signed commuted Debs' sentence on December 23, 1921. At Harding's request, Debs visited the president at the White House before going home to Indiana.|$|E

5|$|In spring 1917, Rau, by {{this time}} an elected trade union {{official}} in his firm, participated {{in the attempt to}} organise a strike <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> His action led to a reprimand from his employer, and may have hastened his conscription into the army in August 1917. In the army he was trained in the Zuffenhausen-garrisoned Infantry Regiment 126 and deployed to the Western Front as member of a machine gun company. In September 1918 a shell splinter penetrated his lungs. In the following weeks, he was treated in military hospitals in Weimar and in Stuttgart's neighbouring town Ludwigsburg. While in Ludwigsburg, Rau managed to get leave at short notice on 8November 1918 and joined the in those days developing revolution in Stuttgart.|$|E
5|$|The League soon sent envoys to its neighbors, Stefan I Crnojević and Đurađ Branković. Branković, a lord of Serbian Despotate, who {{was also}} in dispute with Venice over the Principality of Zeta, {{expressed}} his willingness to help Skanderbeg against the Republic but not against the Ottoman Empire. The Venetians sent an ambassador to Skanderbeg offering him 1,000 ducats to lay aside all claims to Dagnum in return that the Albanians would protect the country and keep the roads free from violence. Skanderbeg, however, {{refused to accept the}} offer and hostilities continued. Alongside the Spani family, the Dushmani family was <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> with Venice and did not participate in it.|$|E
5|$|When Nixon took office, about 300 American {{soldiers}} were dying each week in Vietnam, {{and the war}} was broadly unpopular in the United States, with violent protests <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> ongoing. The Johnson administration had agreed to suspend bombing in exchange for negotiations without preconditions, but this agreement never fully took force. According to Walter Isaacson, soon after taking office, Nixon had concluded that the Vietnam War could not be won and {{he was determined to}} end the war quickly. He sought some arrangement which would permit American forces to withdraw, while leaving South Vietnam secure against attack.|$|E

5|$|The British Government had {{expected}} {{the campaign to}} be over within months, and the protracted war became increasingly unpopular especially after revelations about the conditions in the concentration camps. Emily Hobhouse, a campaigner, had forced the British Government {{to set up the}} Fawcett Commission, led by suffragist Millicent Fawcett, into the conditions at the camps. Hobhouse published reports from the camps which told of thousands of deaths from disease and malnutrition. These reports helped to sway public opinion <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> The demand for peace led to a settlement of hostilities, and in 1902, the Treaty of Vereeniging was signed. The two republics were absorbed into the British Empire, although the British were forced to make a number of concessions and reparations to the Boers. The granting of limited autonomy for the area ultimately led to the establishment of the Union of South Africa.|$|E
25|$|A {{coalition}} of United States-based groups, initiated by United for Peace and Justice, Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, National Organization for Women, Friends of the Earth, U.S. Labor <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>War,</b> Climate Crisis Coalition, People's Hurricane Relief Fund, National Youth and Student Peace Coalition, and Veterans for Peace held a national mobilization <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> in New York City on April 29.|$|E
