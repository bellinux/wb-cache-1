5|$|At {{the time}} of the invasion, both {{mountain}} detachments had completed mobilisation and concentration, and were in position. Detachment Lika was at its mobilisation centre, but the turn-out of men for its infantry component was low. The 38th Infantry Division Dravska was completing its concentration. A large proportion of the 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski was moving from its mobilisation centres to its concentration areas. Across the 7th Army, around 80 percent of troops had <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> mobilisation order, but only 45 to 50 percent of vehicles and animals were available.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} season of Millionaire in the United States, the show crowned its first million-dollar winner. On November 19, 1999, John Carpenter won the show's top prize without using any lifelines, save for a phone call on the final {{question}} to tell his father {{he was going to}} win the million dollars. After Carpenter <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> final question, which concerned Richard Nixon's appearance on Laugh-In in 1968, host Regis Philbin proclaimed Carpenter the show's (and worldwide format's) first top prize winner.|$|E
50|$|Each {{question}} {{gives the}} contestant three opportunities to answer: <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> question alone, <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> question {{with an additional}} clue to <b>the</b> <b>answer,</b> and <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> question {{with a choice of}} two answers.|$|R
50|$|An {{answer to}} either set of {{questions}} {{will allow us to}} devise a means of <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> other. <b>Answering</b> <b>the</b> former question set first is called particularism, whereas <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> latter set first is called methodism. A third solution is skepticism, which proclaims that since one cannot have an <b>answer</b> to <b>the</b> first {{set of questions}} without first <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> second set, and one cannot hope to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> second set of questions without first knowing <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> to <b>the</b> first set, we are, therefore, unable to answer either.

5|$|On 22 June 1399, Jadwiga {{gave birth}} to a {{daughter}}, baptised Elizabeth Bonifacia, but within a month the mother and daughter died, leaving Władysław sole ruler of the Kingdom of Poland and without an heir nor much legitimacy to rule the kingdom. Jadwiga's death undermined Władysław's right to the throne, and as a result old conflicts between the nobility of Lesser Poland, generally sympathetic to Władysław, and the gentry of Greater Poland began to surface. In 1402, Władysław <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> rumblings against his rule by marrying Anna of Celje, a granddaughter of Casimir III of Poland, a political match that re-legitimised his reign.|$|E

5|$|Soviet air assaults {{against civilians}} in Estonian towns {{were a part}} of the offensive, aimed at forcing the Estonians away from {{supporting}} the German side. The Soviet Long Range Aviation branch assaulted the Estonian capital of Tallinn on the night of 8–9 March. Approximately 40% of the housing was destroyed in the city; 25,000 people were left homeless and 500 civilians were killed. The result of the air raid was the opposite of what the Soviets intended, as people felt disgusted by the Soviet atrocities; more men <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> German conscription call.|$|E

5|$|De Iniusta {{states that}} St-Calais was {{brought before the}} king and royal court for trial on 2 November 1088, at Salisbury, the king having confiscated the bishop's lands before the trial. At the trial St-Calais held that as a bishop {{he could not be}} tried in a secular court, and he refused to answer the accusations. Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, {{presented}} the king's case, declaring that the confiscated lands had been held as fiefs, and thus St-Calais could be tried as a vassal, not as a bishop. St-Calais objected, and continued to refuse to answer the allegations. After numerous conferences and discussions, the court held that St-Calais could be tried as a vassal in a feudal court. St-Calais then appealed to Rome, but his request was rejected by the king and the judges. Those judging the case held that because St-Calais never <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> formal accusation, and because he appealed to Rome, his fief, or the lands he held as a bishop, was forfeit.|$|E

5|$|Following Theodore's coronation, {{there were}} four rulers who claimed the {{imperial}} title and vied for control of Constantinople: Theodore, the Latin Emperor, Robert of Courtenay, John III Doukas Vatatzes of Nicaea, and the young but ambitious John II Asen (r. 1218–41) of Bulgaria. The Latin Empire was a shadow of its former strength: following Poimanenon, the Latins had lost most of their territories in Asia, while in Europe, it was soon reduced to the environs of Constantinople itself. Already in 1224, {{or at least in}} 1225, Theodore captured Chalcidice with Mount Athos, and in spring 1225, he advanced through eastern Macedonia and western Thrace, seizing Christopolis, Xanthi, Gratianopolis, Mosynopolis and Didymoteicho. In an attempt to pre-empt him and block his advance onto Constantinople, the Nicaeans had <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> summons of the inhabitants of Adrianople and taken over the city from the Latins. Theodore however crossed the Evros River and blockaded the city, until it agreed to surrender. The Nicaean army, under the protostrator John Ises and John Kammytzes, was allowed to withdraw unmolested to Asia with ships provided by Theodore.|$|E
