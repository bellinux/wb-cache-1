At 12:40 p.m. on 12 January 2011, Autoradio's transmitting license was revoked {{at the station}} was shut down. The Republican Commission on Television and Radio decided to annul the rights of <b>Autoradio</b> due to Autoradio's broadcasting of opponents of Lukashenka's regime during the 2010 Belarusian presidential election.|$|E

50|$|If Klubrádió {{had offered}} HUF 8 million more per year, {{it would have}} won the 95,3 frequency. Klubrádió {{previously}} had to collect more than HUF 120 million from donations through a fundraising campaign {{in order to maintain}} its running; at the same time, advertisers either withdrew or refused putting ads on a so-called liberal Klubrádió for fearing of the political consequences that were apparent after the latest elections. Meanwhile, Klubrádió lost its frequencies and licenses in countryside. If <b>Autoradio</b> cannot pay the amount it offered to pay, or the signing of the contract with this company fails for any reason, the frequency will go to the second placed participant, Klubrádió. After press attacks on <b>Autoradio,</b> the winner of the tender intensified, the firm announced a plan to a sell the frequency, and that they started talks with several radio companies including Klubrádió. <b>Autoradio</b> is reportedly asking HUF 200 million for the frequency enabling Klubrádió to continue owning the frequency regardless of the court case if it raises the money.The so-called Klub-rule (Klubszabály) is a newly implemented rule administered by the Media authority, to exclude the Klubrádió from the tender by observing that the applicant did not undersign the left-hand empty pages of the application.|$|E
50|$|The second {{generation}} Touran was introduced at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show. It uses the Volkswagen Group MQB platform and offers increased cabin space, four new engines with 19% less fuel consumption, {{and an array}} of new advanced driver-assistance systems and infotainment options. <b>Autoradio</b> with Apple CarPlay and android auto is included as an option.|$|E
50|$|Klubrádió {{has been}} still {{operating}} {{and on the}} air {{every day on the}} Budapest frequency as of January 2012, and the station owns several other frequencies countryside. The court case launched by Klubrádió had the effect of slowing the transition down because <b>Autoradio</b> cannot sign the broadcast contract until the case has been resolved. Until then, Klubrádió can broadcast upon temporary licenses (because its original frequency expired in 2011 February) In advertisements aired on Klubrádió, the station said that it would continue broadcasting on the internet and other frequencies if it lose the Budapest frequency. Experiencing the political pressure and administrative measures against Klubrádió, even Secretary Hillary Clinton of the US found it important to identify Klubrádió with the freedom of press in Hungary, and the corresponding authorities of the EU condemned the actions against Klubrádió directed by the ruling right-wing party. Hungary’s democratic regression is also causing alarm within the European Union and EU member states. The country’s parliament recently passed constitutional amendments limiting the powers of the constitutional court in a move which observers believe will undermine democratic checks and balances, and enhance the authoritarian drift under Orbán.|$|E
5000|$|The {{parliamentary}} elections of 2010 caused a serious {{impact on the}} run of Klubrádió. The commercial station lost its financial integrity because many companies and agencies stopped advertising in Klubrádió for fearing of political consequences, and it almost went bankruptcy. After {{the victory of the}} right-wing party Fidesz securing the 2/3 majority in Parliament, Klubrádió became the number one enemy {{in the eye of the}} ruling party. In addition, in February, 2011, the broadcast license of Klubrádió expired but it continued broadcasting anyway due to temporary licenses, which were granted on a regular basis. Three tenders for three Budapest frequencies were advertised in mid-2011 with identical terms and conditions. Klubrádió have only submitted a tender offer for one of them, without providing a reason as to why it did not consider the others viable. The tender was preceded by intense lobbying for Klubrádió; various pressure groups tried to ensure that tender invitation is construed in such a way that only Klubrádió could win. [...] Klubrádió had issued several suggestions in open hearings before the tender was finalized. First, Klubrádió suggested that the frequency should be based on the premise of public service frequency, where the license fee might be zero forints. If the frequency were to be a commercial frequency, Klubrádió have suggested a license fee of 6 million forints. During the actual tender, Klubrádió itself have offered to pay 55 million forints for the frequency, almost ten times of its original suggestion. This resulted in claims that the original Klubrádió suggestions were provocative. However, according to the tender, the would-be winner of 95,3 MHz should be broadcasting mainly music and local news that implied the possible loss of Klubrádió knowing a talk and news station would not have a chance to be in accordance with the new premises. After closing the tender, <b>Autorádió</b> gained first place for 95,3 MHz with 66 points, because Klubrádió refused to bid for the other two frequencies with identical terms, this raised the possibility of losing a Budapest frequency. Klubrádió came in second with 65 points, the pressure intensified to achieve overturning the decision. In Hungary, all tender decisions are subject to legal review, and when the management of Klubrádió launched a suit for the frequency, a court case began. Klubrádió did not argue that they should have received more points, rather they claimed that the winner's offer was „unrealistic” and should have been disqualified. Klubrádió added that they judged all bids over 53 million were „unrealistic”. The argument would also disqualify Klubrádió's own bid of 55 million forints of yearly broadcasting fee. While the court case was still in progress, there were reports of more outside pressure trying to ensure Klubrádió's gain of the frequency. Klubrádió and the mainstream media also attacked the winners of the tender <b>Autoradio</b> for being a startup company without relevant experience in broadcasting, founded in early 2011, even though Monográf Rt, the owner of Klubrádió was just a month older at the time it acquired Klubrádió.|$|E
40|$|The {{area of the}} ventromedial {{nucleus of}} the {{hypothalamus}} in the guinea-pig was shown in autoradiographs to contain high affinity binding sites for oxytocin. In order to ascertain whether these sites may represent neuronal receptors, single-cell extracellular recordings were obtained from ventromedial neurons in coronal slices of t h e hypothalamus of adult guinea-pigs. Oxytocin applied in the nanomolar range excited {{about half of the}} neurons tested; none were inhibited. The response to the peptide was reversible and concentration-dependent. It was exerted directly since it persisted under t h e condition of synaptic isolation. Moreover, the effect was specific since it could be mimicked by a selective oxytocin agonist and since vasopressin was usually at least 10 -fold weaker than oxytocin. These findings suggest that the binding sites for oxytocin detected by light microscopic autoradiography in the guinea-pig hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus represent functional receptors. In the rat brain, specific high affinity binding sites for oxytocin could be detected in various areas by light microscopic <b>autoradio...</b>|$|E
40|$|Injection of 20 -MC {{was done}} in the {{anterior}} lob e of the prostatic gland using male rats of Wistar strain and its carcinogenetic process was observed with HE stain and autoradiography. 1. Following injection of 20 -MC in the anterior lobe of the prostatic gland of rats, histological changes progressing in the order of glandular epithel, squamous metaplasia and cancer were confirmed. 2. In <b>autoradio</b> g raphy, both of Tritium Index and mean grain counts were decreased in 3 and 4 days after the 20 -MC injection. 3. From around 10 days after injection, squamous metaplasia took place with increased Tritium Index but no carcinomatous change occurred within 50 days. Labelling was localized in only basal layer, wich indicates that the one of devided daughter cell stays in the basic layer with maintaining mitotic ability, while the other loses mitotic ability and is pushed upward followed by falling off. The grain counts distributed in a narrow range with the average of 10 to 14 and the mean grain count was less than normal. 4. Around 150 to 200 days after injection, increased Tritium Index with generalized labelling of some cancer nests became evident. This means that each of devided cell holds mitotic ability. The mean grain counts increased and distribution of grain count showed diphasic pattern in narrow ranges. The findings suggested of qualitative and quantitative alterations of DNA although the cause of change was not conclusively decided as direct or secondary effects of 20 -MC. 5. This experimental tumor seemed to be possessed of two different abnormal cell dividing modes; one is shortening of a generation and the other is maintennance of mitotic ability in both of daughter cells. 6. In the interstitial tissu e, labelled cells increased in number until squamous metaplasia occurred, while they decreased markedly after the cancerous changes developed...|$|E
