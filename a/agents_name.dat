40|$|In {{a variety}} of markets firms voluntarily and {{independently}} delegate control over certain aspects of marketing to common agents. In this article we present an explicit model of agency delegation where firms noncooperatively select <b>agents,</b> <b>name</b> output prices, and choose compensation schemes. We exhibit an equilibrium in which all strategic variables [...] not merely the marketing choices delegated to agents, but prices as well [...] are selected perfectly cooperatively. This cooperative equilibrium is very simple and attractive: each firm sets the collusive output price, and employs a commission scheme to compensate the agent. Although each firm {{has the ability to}} condition compensation on the agent's action (as well as on sales), firms choose to forego this opportunity. In essence, common agency provides an indirect mechanism through which competing firms may "sell out" to a single party, thereby creating incentives which generate a collusive outcome. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the Multimedia Data Exchange (MDE) Agent Pattern, which itself {{describes the}} decoupling {{of the communication}} mechanisms from the actual implementation of two multimedia components. The general model of Producer (Source), Filter, Consumer (Sink) that {{is used for the}} modeling of temporal media types as components is enhanced by this decoupling. The components must have the ability to connect to each other. This connection could be modeled as a simple relationship between the two components but this solution would require that the implementation of this relationship is the responsibility of either or both of the components and would also be visible by the application. This pattern proposes the separation and isolation of the implementation of this relationship into a different class and also proposes customization via a hierarchy that will produce different in usage and characteristics MDE <b>Agents.</b> <b>Name</b> : Multimedia Data Exchange Agent.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} how <b>agents</b> should be <b>named</b> and what kind of software infrastructure is necessary in order to locate an agent given only its name. We assume an agent environment which (1) is dynamic with agents being created and destroyed frequently; (2) undergoes re-organizations with agent groups and sub-groups forming and disbanding; and (3) supports agent communication by any of several transport mechanisms such as TCP/IP, email, http and distributed object systems. This leads us to propose the establishment of agent domains which are organized into an agent domain hierarchy. <b>Agent</b> <b>name</b> resolution can be done by <b>agent</b> <b>name</b> servers, analogous to Internet domain name servers. One of the additional benefits from this approach is that it easily supports the definition of proxy agents. We sketch how this proposal would impact the KQML agent communication language and protocol and describe an ongoing implementation of a generic KQML <b>Agent</b> <b>Name</b> Server and its integration into t [...] ...|$|R
