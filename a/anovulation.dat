5|$|In a dissenting opinion, a {{systematic}} review of four head-to-head comparative trials of metformin and clomifene found them equally effective for infertility. Four positive studies of metformin were in women not responding to clomifene, while {{the population in}} the negative studies was drug-naive or uncontrolled for the previous treatment. Metformin should be used as a second-line drug if clomifene treatment fails. Another review recommended metformin unreservedly as a first-line treatment option because it has positive effects not only on <b>anovulation,</b> but also on insulin resistance, hirsutism and obesity often associated with PCOS. A Cochrane Collaboration review found metformin improves ovulation and pregnancy rates, particularly when combined with clomifene, but is not associated with {{an increase in the number}} of live births.|$|E
5|$|Antidiabetic {{therapy has}} been {{proposed}} {{as a treatment for}} polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition frequently associated with insulin resistance, since the late 1980s. The use of metformin in PCOS was first reported in 1994, in a small study conducted at the University of the Andes, Venezuela. The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended in 2004 that women with PCOS and a body mass index above 25 be given metformin for <b>anovulation</b> and infertility when other therapies fail to produce results. However, two clinical studies completed in 2006–2007 returned mostly negative results, with metformin performing no better than placebo, and a metformin-clomifene combination no better than clomifene alone. Reflecting this, subsequent reviews large randomized controlled trials in general have not shown the promise suggested by the early studies. UK and international clinical practice guidelines do not recommend metformin as a first-line treatment or do not recommend it at all, except for women with glucose intolerance. The guidelines suggest clomiphene as the first medication option and emphasize lifestyle modification independently from the drug treatment.|$|E
5|$|Women develop {{long-term}} {{complications of}} alcohol dependence {{more rapidly than}} do men. Additionally, women have a higher mortality rate from alcoholism than men. Examples of long-term complications include brain, heart, and liver damage and {{an increased risk of}} breast cancer. Additionally, heavy drinking over time has been found to {{have a negative effect on}} reproductive functioning in women. This results in reproductive dysfunction such as <b>anovulation,</b> decreased ovarian mass, problems or irregularity of the menstrual cycle, and early menopause. Alcoholic ketoacidosis can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a recent history of binge drinking. The amount of alcohol that can be biologically processed and its effects differ between sexes. Equal dosages of alcohol consumed by men and women generally result in women having higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), since women generally have a higher percentage of body fat and therefore a lower volume of distribution for alcohol than men, and because the stomachs of men tend to metabolize alcohol more quickly.|$|E
25|$|Female-specific: masculinization, {{irreversible}} voice deepening, hirsutism (excessive facial/body hair growth), menstrual disturbances (e.g., <b>anovulation,</b> oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea), clitoral enlargement, breast atrophy, uterine atrophy, teratogenicity (in female fetuses).|$|E
25|$|In Britain, male factor {{infertility}} {{accounts for}} 25% of infertile couples, while 25% remain unexplained. 50% are female causes with 25% being due to <b>anovulation</b> and 25% tubal problems/other.|$|E
25|$|Polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} – {{a complex}} syndrome in {{women in the}} reproductive years where <b>anovulation</b> and androgen excess are commonly displayed as hirsutism. In many cases of PCOS, insulin resistance is present.|$|E
25|$|PCOS may be {{associated}} with chronic inflammation, with several investigators correlating inflammatory mediators with <b>anovulation</b> and other PCOS symptoms. Similarly, {{there seems to be a}} relation between PCOS and increased level of oxidative stress.|$|E
25|$|Abnormal uterine {{bleeding}} can {{be caused}} by structural abnormalities in the reproductive tract, <b>anovulation,</b> bleeding disorders, hormone issues (such as hypothyroidism) or cancer of the reproductive tract. Initial evaluation aims at figuring out pregnancy status, menopausal status, and the source of bleeding.|$|E
25|$|Not {{all women}} with PCOS have {{difficulty}} becoming pregnant. For those that do, <b>anovulation</b> or infrequent ovulation {{is a common}} cause. Other factors include changed levels of gonadotropins, hyperandrogenemia and hyperinsulinemia. Like women without PCOS, women with PCOS that are ovulating may be infertile due to other causes, such as tubal blockages due to a history of sexually transmitted diseases.|$|E
25|$|The risk of {{twin birth}} can vary {{depending}} on what types of fertility treatments are used. With in vitro fertilisation (IVF), this is primarily due to the insertion of multiple embryos into the uterus. Ovarian hyperstimulation without IVF has a very high risk of multiple birth. Reversal of <b>anovulation</b> with clomifene (trade names including Clomid) has a relatively less but yet significant risk of multiple pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|However {{insufficient}} estradiol and progesterone {{are produced}} to induce maturation of an egg and ovulation. Although prepubertal ovaries are inactive enough that no lipid accumulates to cause damage, {{once they have}} begun to produce estrogen, lipid damage begins to accrue and the ability to produce estrogen, as well as ovulate, is slowly degraded. Cysts also form in the ovaries. Women with lipoid CAH have been infertile presumably due to <b>anovulation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other alleles {{result in}} even milder degrees of hyperandrogenism {{that may not}} even cause {{problems}} in males {{and may not be}} recognized until adolescence or later in females. Mild androgen effects in young women may include hirsutism, acne, or <b>anovulation</b> (which in turn can cause infertility). Testosterone levels in these women may be mildly elevated, or simply above average. These clinical features, of course, are those of polycystic ovary syndrome, and a small percentage of women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) are found to have late-onset CAH when investigated.|$|E
25|$|The first menstrual {{bleeding}} {{is referred}} to as menarche, and typically occurs about two years after thelarche. The average age of menarche is 12.5 in the United States. Most American girls experience their first period at 11, 12 or 13, but some experience it earlier than their 11th birthday and others after their 14th birthday. In fact, anytime between 8 and 16 is normal. In Canada, the average age of menarche is 12.72, and in the United Kingdom it is 12.9. The time between menstrual periods (menses) is not always regular {{in the first two years}} after menarche. Ovulation is necessary for fertility, but may or may not accompany the earliest menses. In postmenarchal girls, about 80% of the cycles were anovulatory in the first year after menarche, 50% in the third year and 10% in the sixth year. Initiation of ovulation after menarche is not inevitable. A high proportion of girls with continued irregularity in the menstrual cycle several years from menarche will continue to have prolonged irregularity and <b>anovulation,</b> and are at higher risk for reduced fertility.|$|E
500|$|In a study, {{the blood}} serum of female addax was {{analyzed}} through immunoassay {{to know about}} their luteal phase. Estrous cycle duration was of about 33 days. During pregnancy, ultrasonography showed the uterine horns as coiled. The maximum diameters of the ovarian follicle and the corpus luteum were [...] and [...] Each female underwent an anovulatory period lasting 39 to 131 days, during {{which there was no}} ovulation. <b>Anovulation</b> was rare in winter, which suggested the effect of seasons on the estrous cycle.|$|E
500|$|Infrequent or {{irregular}} ovulation {{is called}} oligoovulation. The absence of ovulation is called <b>anovulation.</b> Normal menstrual flow can occur without ovulation preceding it: an anovulatory cycle. In some cycles, follicular development may start but not be completed; nevertheless, estrogens will be formed and [...] stimulate the uterine lining. Anovulatory flow {{resulting from a}} very thick endometrium caused by prolonged, continued high estrogen levels is called estrogen breakthrough bleeding. Anovulatory bleeding triggered by a sudden drop in estrogen levels is called withdrawal bleeding. Anovulatory cycles commonly occur before menopause (perimenopause) and in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|<b>An{{ovulation}}</b> is {{absence of}} ovulation {{when it would}} be normally expected (in a post-menarchal, premenopausal female). [...] <b>Anovulation</b> usually manifests itself as irregularity of menstrual periods, that is, unpredictable variability of intervals, duration, or bleeding. <b>Anovulation</b> can also cause cessation of periods (secondary amenorrhea) or excessive bleeding (dysfunctional uterine bleeding).|$|E
2500|$|Infertility: [...] This {{generally}} results {{directly from}} chronic <b>anovulation</b> (lack of ovulation).|$|E
2500|$|For {{those women}} that after weight loss still are {{anovulatory}} or for anovulatory lean women, then the ovulation-inducing medications clomiphene citrate and FSH {{are the principal}} treatments used to promote ovulation. [...] Previously, the anti-diabetes medication metformin was recommended treatment for <b>anovulation,</b> but it appears less effective than clomiphene.|$|E
50|$|<b>An{{ovulation}}</b> is {{absence of}} ovulation {{when it would}} be normally expected (in a post-menarchal, premenopausal woman). <b>Anovulation</b> usually manifests itself as irregularity of menstrual periods, that is, unpredictable variability of intervals, duration, or bleeding. <b>Anovulation</b> can also cause cessation of periods (secondary amenorrhea) or excessive bleeding (dysfunctional uterine bleeding).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Anovulation.</b> Female {{infertility}} {{caused by}} <b>anovulation</b> is called [...] "anovulatory infertility", {{as opposed to}} [...] "ovulatory infertility" [...] in which ovulation is present.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anovulation</b> is {{a common}} cause of {{gynecological}} hemorrhage. Under the influence of estrogen the endometrium (uterine lining) is stimulated and eventually such lining will be shed off (estrogen breakthrough bleeding). The <b>anovulation</b> chapter discusses its multiple possible causes. Longstanding <b>anovulation</b> {{can also lead to}} endometrial hyperplasia and facilitate the development of endometrial cancer.|$|E
50|$|It {{is in fact}} {{possible}} to restore ovulation using appropriate medication, and ovulation is successfully restored in approximately 90% of cases. The first step is the diagnosis of <b>anovulation.</b> The identification of <b>anovulation</b> is not easy; contrary to what is commonly believed, women undergoing <b>anovulation</b> still have (more or less) regular periods. In general, patients only notice {{that there is a}} problem once they have started trying to conceive.|$|E
50|$|<b>An{{ovulation}}</b> is {{when the}} ovaries do not release an oocyte during a menstrual cycle. Therefore, ovulation does not take place. However, a woman who does not ovulate at each menstrual cycle is not necessarily going through menopause. Chronic <b>anovulation</b> is a common cause of infertility.|$|E
50|$|The World Health Organization {{criteria}} for classification of <b>anovulation</b> include {{the determination of}} oligomenorrhea (menstrual cycle >35 days) or amenorrea (menstrual cycle > 6 months) in combination with concentration of prolactin, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol (E2). The patients are classified as WHO1 (15%) - hypo-gonadotropic, hypo-estrogenic, WHO2 (80%) - normo-gonadotropic, normo-estrogenic, and WHO3 (5%) - hyper-gonadotropic, hypo-estrogenic. The vast majority of <b>anovulation</b> patients belong to the WHO2 group and demonstrate very heterogeneous symptoms ranging from <b>anovulation,</b> obesity, biochemical or clinical hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance.|$|E
50|$|Previously, {{metformin}} {{was recommended}} treatment for <b>anovulation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Not {{all women}} with PCOS have {{difficulty}} becoming pregnant. For those who do, <b>anovulation</b> {{is a common}} cause. The mechanism of this <b>anovulation</b> is uncertain, but {{there is evidence of}} arrested antral follicle development, which, in turn, may be caused by abnormal interaction of insulin and luteinizing hormone (LH) on granulosa cells.|$|E
50|$|For most women, {{alteration}} of menstrual periods {{is the principal}} indication of chronic <b>anovulation.</b> Ovulatory menstrual periods tend to be regular and predictable in terms of cycle length, duration and heaviness of bleeding, and other symptoms. Ovulatory periods are often accompanied by midcycle symptoms such as mittelschmerz or premenstrual symptoms. In contrast, <b>anovulation</b> usually manifests itself as irregularity of menstrual periods, that is, unpredictable variability of intervals, duration, or bleeding. <b>Anovulation</b> can also cause cessation of periods (secondary amenorrhea) or excessive bleeding (dysfunctional uterine bleeding). Mittelschmerz and premenstrual symptoms tend to be absent or reduced when a woman is anovulatory.|$|E
5000|$|A {{physician}} {{needs to}} investigate the cause of <b>anovulation.</b> Common causes are: ...|$|E
5000|$|Infertility: [...] This {{generally}} results {{directly from}} chronic <b>anovulation</b> (lack of ovulation).|$|E
50|$|Ovulation {{induction}} in {{the sense}} of reversing <b>anovulation</b> or oligoovulation is indicated for women who do not ovulate on their own regularly, such as those with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The medication which is most commonly used to treat <b>anovulation</b> is clomifene citrate (or clomid), which is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that increases production of gonadotropins by inhibiting negative feedback from estrogen on the hypothalamus.|$|E
5000|$|... in some {{countries}} also: ablactation and dysfunctions associated with hyperprolactinemia (amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, <b>anovulation,</b> nonpuerperal mastitis and galactorrhea); ...|$|E
50|$|Temperature {{charting}} is {{a useful}} way of providing early clues about <b>anovulation,</b> and can help gynaecologists in their diagnosis.|$|E
50|$|The {{treatment}} of <b>anovulation</b> is termed ovulation induction {{and is usually}} quite efficient. The main treatments are clomifene citrate and gonadotropins.|$|E
50|$|This {{accounts}} for around 10-15% {{of all cases}} of <b>anovulation.</b> The ovaries can stop working in about 5% of cases. This may be because the ovaries do not contain eggs. However, a complete blockage of the ovaries is rarely a cause of infertility. Blocked ovaries can start functioning again without a clear medical explanation. In some cases, the egg may have matured properly, but the follicle may have failed to burst (or the follicle may have burst without releasing the egg). This is called luteinised unruptured follicle syndrome (LUFS). Physical damage to the ovaries, or ovaries with multiple cysts, may affect their ability to function. This is called ovarian dystrophy. Patients who are suffering from Stein-Leventhal syndrome (also referred to as polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS) can also suffer from <b>anovulation.</b> Up to 90% of cases of <b>anovulation</b> are caused by PCOS; this syndrome is usually hereditary.|$|E
50|$|Also, where <b>anovulation</b> or oligovulation is {{secondary}} to another disease, {{the treatment for}} the underlying disease {{can be regarded as}} ovulation induction, by indirectly resulting in ovulation.|$|E
50|$|FSH is used {{commonly}} in infertility therapy, {{mainly for}} ovarian hyperstimulation {{as part of}} IVF. In some cases, it is used for reversal of <b>anovulation</b> as well.|$|E
