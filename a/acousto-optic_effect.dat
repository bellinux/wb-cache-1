40|$|The acousto-optic {{interaction}} affords {{a convenient}} way of optically probing ultrasonic waves in medical diagnosis and nondestructive evaluation. The effects of ultrasonic waves {{on the light}} transmitting through transparent media arise from the refractive index variations produced by ultrasonic waves. The index variations may be detected by optical deflection, diffraction or interference methods [1 – 4]. In Raman-Nath regime, the acoustic waves act as a moving phase grating and diffract the light into different orders. Schlieren visualisation derived from this mechanism has been extensively used to ultrasonic measurements in liquids. In solid media, the <b>acousto-optic</b> <b>effects</b> become more complicated because of the induced optical birefringence.

Compared with LCTFs, AOTFs enjoy a much faster tuning speed (microseconds versus milliseconds) and broader wavelength ranges. However, since they rely on the <b>acousto-optic</b> <b>effect</b> of sound waves to diffract and shift the frequency of light, imaging quality is comparatively poor, and the optical design requirements are more stringent. Indeed, LCTFs are capable of diffraction-limited imaging onto high-resolution imaging sensors.

If the frequency of modulation is matched to the round-trip time of the cavity, then some light in the cavity sees repeated upshifts in frequency, and some repeated downshifts. After many repetitions, the upshifted and downshifted light is swept out of the gain bandwidth of the laser. The only light which is unaffected is that which passes through the modulator when the induced frequency shift is zero, which forms a narrow pulse of light.|$|E

50|$|AOPDF is a {{programmable}} spectral filter. From {{signal processing}} point of view, the AOPDF {{corresponds to a}} time-variant passive linear transversal filter with a programmable finite impulse response. Phase and amplitude filtering in the AOPDF is achieved by virtue of birefringent <b>acousto-optic</b> <b>effect</b> and can be represented by a convolution between the amplitude of the input optical signal Ein(t) and a programmable acoustical signal S(t/α) proportional to the electrical signal S(t) applied to the Piezoelectric transducer (made typically from lithium niobate). Here, α is a scaling factor equal to {{the ratio of the}} speed of sound v to the speed of light c times the index difference Δn between the ordinary and the extraordinary waves taken along the propagation axis in the crystal. In the limit of low diffraction efficiency the AOPDF behaves as a linear filter and the small value of the α (typically 10−7) allows for the quantitative control of optical signals with frequencies of tens to hundreds terahertz with electrical signals of tens of megahertz, which are readily produced by commercial waveform generators.|$|E
50|$|An optical {{modulator}} is an optical device {{which is used}} to modulate a beam of light with a perturbation device. It is a kind of transmitter to convert information to optical binary signal through optical fiber (optical waveguide) or transmission medium of optical frequency in fiber optic communication. There are several methods to manipulate this device depending on the parameter of a light beam like amplitude modulator (majority), phase modulator, polarization modulator etc.The easiest way to obtain modulation is modulation of intensity of a light by the current driving the light source (laser diode). This sort of modulation is called direct modulation, as opposed to the external modulation performed by a light modulator. For this reason, light modulators are called external light modulators.According to manipulation of the properties of material modulators are divided into two groups, absorptive modulators (absorption coefficient) and refractive modulators (refractive index of the material). Absorption coefficient can be manipulated by Franz-Keldysh effect, Quantum-Confined Stark Effect, excitonic absorption, or changes of free carrier concentration. Usually, if several such effects appear together, the modulator is called electro-absorptive modulator. Refractive modulators most often make use of electro-optic effect (amplitude & phase modulation), other modulators are made with <b>acousto-optic</b> <b>effect,</b> magneto-optic effect such as Faraday and Cotton-Mouton effects. The other case of modulators is spatial light modulator (SLM) which is modified two dimensional distribution of amplitude & phase of an optical wave.|$|E

40|$|Power {{ultrasonic}} surgical devices {{operating at}} low ultrasonic frequencies (20 - 100 kHz) {{have been shown}} to provide some advantages over reciprocating or manual devices in removal of tissue. Despite opportunities for widespread applications in orthopaedic, dental, ophthalmic and general surgical procedures, the mechanisms of interaction between high power ultrasound and human tissue is not well understood and {{little is known about the}} effects and safety implications for power ultrasonics in human tissue. Therefore, the effects of power ultrasonic devices on human tissue are investigated in this thesis. From the limited literature on this topic, the basic effects caused by high power ultrasound on human tissue can be summarized into three main categories: mechanical response, thermal effects and acoustic cavitation. However, the relative contribution of each of these remains unclear. Thus, this study aims to analyse these responses and effects of tissue mimic materials subject to power ultrasonic excitation and hence investigate the potential to quantitively characterise the power ultrasonic damage on tissue. Due to the complexity of the interaction between cutting surface with tissue, the damage caused by cutting process was not covered. But the investigation of the damage by accumulated ultrasound energy in tissue was the main research topic in this thesis. To substitute for human tissue, representative materials such as E-glass filled epoxy resin (ER), polyurethane foam (PUF) and transparent silicone elastomer (SE) were used in experimental studies to simulate the behaviour of cortical bone, cancellous bone and soft tissue respectively. Their mechanical properties were characterised using uni-axial compression and tensile tests to measure elastic modulus and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) to study the viscoelastic behaviour. Frequency and temperature dependent behaviour of tissue surrogates under power ultrasonic excitation were determined using the DMA data based on the time/frequency temperature superposition principle (TTS). The parameters relevant to thermal properties, including thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity were measured using the heat flow method and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Ultrasonic horns were designed using the finite element (FE) method. The performance of the power ultrasonic system was then examined using experimental modal analysis (EMA) with a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) to ensure the system met the experimental requirements. To characterise the responses and effects of tissue mimics subject to power ultrasonic excitation, non-invasive field measurements have been developed for the fast and reproducible experimental assessment of ultrasonic displacement, strain, stress and temperature fields. An ultra-high speed camera and an infrared (IR) camera were used simultaneously for ER and PUF plate samples to obtain the imaging data which provided the displacement and strain fields with digital image correlation (DIC) technique and the steady-state temperature distribution with thermal imaging. The stress field in a transparent rectangular cubiod SE sample during power ultrasonic loading was mapped using a laser interferometer with <b>acousto-optic</b> <b>effects.</b> Due to the absorption of IR light by transparent SE, the temperature distribution of SE was not recorded by IR camera. Numerical and analytical models were developed to simulate the ultrasonic wave propagation using ABAQUS FE software package and Mathematica respectively. These models incorporated frequency dependent mechanical properties of the mimic materials to verify experimental results. The results of the models matched well with the experimental findings of ultrasonic displacement, strain and stress fields. To assess the thermal effects of power ultrasound on the viscoelastic tissue mimics, thermo-mechanical FE models were created using the PZFlex FE software package. Furthermore, FE models for thermal analysis were parameterized in terms of dynamic modulus and acoustic damping coefficient with frequency and temperature dependency for determination of the heat generation and thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity for characterisation of the heat transfer. The FE results have close correlation with measurement results by an IR camera. Based on the experimental and numerical studies, the damage of tissue mimicking materials under power ultrasonic excitation is related to accumulations of cyclic deformation and heating. Non-invasive full-field surface displacement, strain, stress and temperature measurements have the potential to be used to predict the damage of tissue samples interacting with the power ultrasonic devices. This study has provided confidence that the methodology can be applied to study tissue samples subject to excitations typical of ultrasonic surgical devices, including those for orthopaedic bone cutting...|$|R
40|$|A Planar Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) {{illumination}} {{system has been}} designed which is able to generate two beams, separated in frequency by about 600 MHz. This allows a common-path imaging head to be constructed, using a single imaging camera {{instead of the usual}} camera pair. Both illumination beams can be derived from a single laser, using <b>acousto-optic</b> modulators to <b>effect</b> the frequency shifts. One illumination frequency lies on an absorption line of gaseous iodine, and the other just off the absorption line. The beams sequentially illuminate a plane within a seeded flow and Doppler-shifted scattered light passes through an iodine vapour cell onto the camera. The beam that lies at an optical frequency away from the absorption line is not affected by passage through the cell, and provides a reference image. The other beam, the frequency of which coincides with an absorption line, encodes the velocity information as a variation in transmission dependent upon the Doppler shift. Images of the flow under both illumination frequencies are formed on the same camera, ensuring registration of the reference and signal images. This removes a major problem of a two-camera imaging head, and cost efficiency is also improved by the simplification of the system.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is theoretical {{investigation of}} the resonant <b>acousto-optic</b> <b>effect</b> in ionic crystals and thin metal foils. The optical properties {{of these types of}} materials, in the presence of coherent acoustic pump excitation, are numerically modelled and compared with analytical results. The resonant <b>acousto-optic</b> <b>effect</b> in bulk ionic materials is shown to be dependent on the coupling of a bulk acoustic wave to the TO-phonon component of a TO-phonon polariton. This requires that the material used is not only an ionic crystal but also has a strongly anharmonic interatomic potential. It is also demonstrated that the process “TO phonon ± one (two) transverse acoustic phonon(s) → TO phonon” is responsible for the cubic (quartic) resonant <b>acousto-optic</b> <b>effect.</b> The role of acoustic intensity and frequency in the optical properties of CuCl and TlCl is considered. Higher order transitions are also investigated. It is shown that, in the ferroelectric material LiNbO 3, both cubic and quartic scattering channels are sufficiently strong enough to consider the resonant <b>acousto-optic</b> <b>effect</b> associated with them on an equal footing. The coupling strength of both scattering channels is estimated to the nearest order of magnitude. The cubic coupling is found be σ 3 = 5 meV and the quartic coupling strength is found to be σ 4 = 0. 3 meV both for the acoustic intensity Iac = 25 kWcm− 2. The effect the phase difference between the two anharmonic terms has on the optical properties of LiNbO 3 is then investigated. A tunable THz filter is proposed, based on the resonant <b>acousto-optic</b> <b>effect</b> in LiNbO 3. A numerical method is developed to calculated the partial wave amplitudes and optical properties of metal foils with acoustically excited, propagating sinusoidally corrugated surfaces. It is then used on a system of a thin acoustically perturbed Au foil on a glass substrate. The effects of varying the angle of incidence, acoustic wavevector, corrugation amplitude and foil thickness are investigated.
