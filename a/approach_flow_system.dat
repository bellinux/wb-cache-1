The governing equations of motion for the inner pipe are derived under small deformation assumptions and with the consideration of gravitational forces, turbulent boundary layer thickness of external flow, fluid frictional forces, and inertia effects. We obtain discretized dynamical equations using spatial finite difference schemes and calculate the resonant frequencies of a particular pipe system design.

40|$|This {{contribution}} aims at {{introducing a}} new multiscale, multicomponent CFD/CMFD approach for the simulation of thermal-hydraulics flows evolving in complex component-scale configurations. In this novel <b>approach,</b> the <b>flow</b> <b>system</b> could involve {{one or two}} fluids, convective and conductive heat transfer in solids, and phase-change heat transfer. This is made possible thanks to the Immersed Surfaces Technology (IST), a methods inspired from Interface Tracking techniques for two-phase flow, whereby solid bodies contained in the system are defined using a solid level set function to describe their surfaces, transcending conventional unstructured and body-fitted grids (BFC). In a typical two-phase flow, material properties of the fluids and the solid are segregated based on the gasliquid and solid Level-Set functions. The technique helps solve conjugate heat transfer problems without resorting to explicit jump conditions. Selected validation test-cases are presented here. The main application includes steady and transient solutions of the boron dilution in the ROCOM test case. 1...|$|R

Aiming to improve sensitivity, the flow analysis module and the photometer were designed to allow the coupling of a flow cell with an optical pathlength of 150 mm.

40|$|Abstract: Aeration is {{the process}} by which the area of contact between water and air is increased, either by natural methods or by {{mechanical}} devices. Proper aeration can make considerable improvements in a pond ecosystem. This paper investigates pond aeration by two phase <b>flow</b> <b>systems</b> such as high head gated conduit <b>flow</b> <b>systems</b> and two phase pipe <b>flow</b> <b>systems</b> using venturi tubes. When the gate of a high head outlet conduit is partly opened or a minimal amount of differential pressure exists between the inlet and outlet sides of the venturi tube, air suction occurs at air vents. In two phase <b>flow</b> <b>systems,</b> air that is entrained into the water will be momentarily forced downstream in the form of small air bubbles. The dissolution of oxygen into the water results from the air suction downstream of high head gated conduit and venturi tube, and the rising air bubbles into pond. Moreover, high pressure in two phase <b>flow</b> <b>systems</b> also facilitates the dissolution of oxygen into the water. Therefore, two phase <b>flow</b> <b>systems</b> have an extremely high efficiency for transferring oxygen from air bubbles to water.
