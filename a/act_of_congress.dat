5|$|The Court found {{support for}} its {{position}} {{in the history of the}} unratified Titles of Nobility Amendment. The fact that this 1810 proposal had been framed as a constitutional amendment, rather than an ordinary <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress,</b> was seen by the majority as showing that, even before the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress did not believe that it had the power to revoke anyone's citizenship. The Court further noted that a proposed 1818 <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> would have provided a way for citizens to voluntarily relinquish their citizenship, but opponents had argued that Congress had no authority to provide for expatriation.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{reportedly}} haunted locations in Washington, D.C. The city is the capital of the United States, and was founded (pursuant to an <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress)</b> on July 16, 1790. The City of Washington was originally a separate municipality within the Territory of Columbia until an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> in 1871 effectively merged George Town, the City of Washington, and the Territory of Columbia into a single entity called the District of Columbia. Washington, D.C., has been the site of military battles, deadly duels, assassinations, untimely deaths, and associated tragedies.|$|E

5|$|By an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> on October 1, 1942, during Olds' Second Class year, {{the academy}} began a three-year {{curriculum}} {{for the duration}} of the war for cadets entering after July 1939. Cadets applying to the Air Corps were classified as Air Cadets, with a modified curriculum that provided flying training but eliminated Military Topography and Graphics required for Ground Cadets. Olds' class was given an abridged second class course of study until January 19, 1943, when it began an abridged first class course.|$|E
5|$|Following President Obama's {{announcement}} that the United States would move towards normalizing relations with Cuba, Pritzker traveled to Cuba.

5|$|On May 10, 1800, the Indiana Territory {{was created}} by an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress,</b> but no {{provision}} for an official seal {{was included in the}} measure. The earliest recorded use of Indiana Territory's seal was on court documents that were signed by Governor William Henry Harrison in January 1801. The seal he used was an adaptation of the original seal created for the Northwest Territory. Although its origin is uncertain, it is likely that it was Harrison who made the alterations.|$|E
5|$|The defense {{relied on}} the {{provision}} of the Tenure of Office Act that made it applicable only to appointees of the current administration. Since Lincoln had appointed Stanton, the defense maintained Johnson had not violated the act, and also argued that the President {{had the right to}} test the constitutionality of an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress.</b> Johnson's counsel insisted that he make no appearance at the trial, nor publicly comment about the proceedings, and except for a pair of interviews in April, he complied.|$|E
5|$|Although San Francisco {{had sought}} Tuolumne River water {{as early as}} the 1890s, this project did not move forward until the {{disastrous}} earthquake and fire of 1906, which underscored the insufficiency of the existing water supply. The Hetch Hetchy Valley – then compared to Yosemite Valley for its scenic beauty – was chosen for its water quality and hydroelectric potential, but the location within the national park generated controversy. An <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> was required to circumvent federal protection of the Tuolumne River, with the reasoning that public land should be developed for the public benefit.|$|E

5|$|An <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> created {{instruction}} in military science and tactics {{at the college}} level. As {{a result of the}} act, St. John's brought a cadet corps to campus. From 1885 to 1890, Lt. Herbert C. Squires—a veteran of the 7th U.S. Cavalry—built a cadet battalion to a strength of 200, which would provide the foundation for the modern ROTC unit at Fordham. The college built a science building in 1886, lending more legitimacy to science in the curriculum. In addition, a three-year Bachelor of Science degree was created. In 1897, academic regalia for students at commencement was first adopted.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War, Alexandria County (renamed Arlington County in 1920), the closest Virginia county to Washington, D.C., was a predominantly rural area. Originally part of the District of Columbia, the land now comprising the county was retroceded to Virginia in a July 9, 1846 <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> that took effect in 1847. Most of the county is hilly, and at the time, most of the county's population was concentrated in the city of Alexandria, at the far southeastern corner of the county. In 1861, the rest of the county largely consisted of scattered farms, the occasional house, fields for grazing livestock, and Arlington House, owned by Mary Custis, wife of Robert E. Lee.|$|E
5|$|Chinese-American cook Wong Kim Ark, who {{was born}} in San Francisco in 1873, had been denied {{re-entry}} to the United States after a trip abroad, under a law restricting Chinese immigration and prohibiting immigrants from China (the Great Qing) from becoming naturalized U.S. citizens. He challenged the government's refusal to recognize his citizenship, and the Supreme Court ruled in his favor, holding that the citizenship language in the Fourteenth Amendment encompassed the circumstances of his birth and could not be limited in its effect by an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress.</b>|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the ships}} began between late 1863 and early 1864 and they were still being built {{when the war ended}} in early 1865. Construction was {{suspended}} on all four on 17 November 1865; they remained on the stocks. The ships were renamed, usually twice, in 1869 to conform to several new ship naming conventions. Vice Admiral David D. Porter ordered that Colossus be rebuilt to carry 10 large broadside guns and fitted with iron masts in a ship rig, but this never happened. The unseasoned wood in their hulls quickly began to rot after construction was suspended and they were broken up beginning in 1874. Unusually, Passaconaway was condemned by an <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> on 5 August 1882 before she was finally broken up in 1884.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, an <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> officially renamed Bedloe's Island as Liberty Island, {{a change}} {{advocated}} by Bartholdi generations earlier. The act also mentioned {{the efforts to}} found an American Museum of Immigration on the island, which backers took as federal approval of the project, though the government was slow to grant funds for it. Nearby Ellis Island was made part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument by proclamation of President Lyndon Johnson in 1965. In 1972, the immigration museum, in the statue's base, was finally opened in a ceremony led by President Richard Nixon. The museum's backers never provided it with an endowment to secure its future and it closed in 1991 after the opening of an immigration museum on Ellis Island.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the Iran–Contra affair {{became a}} problem for the {{administration}} stemming from the use of proceeds from covert arms sales to Iran during the Iran–Iraq War to fund the Contra rebels fighting against the government in Nicaragua, which had been specifically outlawed by an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress.</b> The affair became a political scandal in the United States during the 1980s. The International Court of Justice, whose jurisdiction to decide the case was disputed by the United States, ruled that the United States had violated international law and breached treaties in Nicaragua in various ways.|$|E

5|$|In the USA, The Smithsonian Institution {{developed}} {{its network}} of observers {{over much of}} the central and eastern United States between the 1840s and 1860s once Joseph Henry took the helm. The U.S. Army Signal Corps inherited this network between 1870 and 1874 by an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress,</b> and expanded it to the west coast soon afterwards. At first, not all the data on the map was used {{due to a lack of}} time standardization. The United States fully adopted time zones in 1905, when Detroit finally established standard time.|$|E
5|$|Waters Davis stipulated in his sale to Deering {{that the}} Cape Florida {{lighthouse}} be restored. Deering {{wrote to the}} U.S. government seeking specifications and guidelines for the lighthouse. Government officials were {{taken aback by the}} request, wondering how a federal lighthouse could have passed into private hands. An <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> and two Executive Orders, in 1847 and 1897, had reserved the island for the federal lighthouse and for military purposes. Patient legal work eventually convinced the U.S. Congress and President Woodrow Wilson to agree to recognize Matheson's and Deering's ownership of Key Biscayne.|$|E
5|$|When the Buffalo nickel {{had been}} struck for 25 years and could be {{replaced}} without an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress,</b> the Mint moved quickly to replace it. Although the Fraser design is popular today among numismatists, it did not enjoy that status in 1938, {{and there was no}} public outcry at the decision. In January 1938, the Mint announced an open competition for the new nickel design, with the winner to receive a prize of $1,000. Anticipating the 1943 bicentennial of Jefferson's birth, competitors were to place his portrait on the obverse, and a depiction of his house Monticello on the reverse.|$|E
