5|$|<b>A</b> <b>cow,</b> {{identified}} with Kamadhenu, is often depicted accompanying the god Dattatreya. In {{relation to the}} deity's iconography, she denotes the Brahminical aspect and Vaishnava connection of the deity contrasting with the accompanying dogs—symbolizing a non-Brahminical aspect. She also symbolizes the Panch Bhuta (the five classical elements) in the icon. Dattatreya is sometimes depicted holding the divine cow {{in one of his}} hands.|$|E
5|$|Elephants are {{polygynous}} breeders, and copulations {{are most}} frequent {{during the peak}} of the wet season. <b>A</b> <b>cow</b> in oestrus releases chemical signals (pheromones) in her urine and vaginal secretions to signal her readiness to mate. A bull will follow a potential mate and assess her condition with the flehmen response, which requires the male to collect a chemical sample with his trunk and bring it to the vomeronasal organ. The oestrous cycle of <b>a</b> <b>cow</b> lasts 14–16 weeks with a 4–6-week follicular phase and an 8- to 10-week luteal phase. While most mammals have one surge of luteinizing hormone during the follicular phase, elephants have two. The first (or anovulatory) surge, could signal to males that the female is in oestrus by changing her scent, but ovulation does not occur until the second (or ovulatory) surge. Fertility rates in cows decline around 45–50 years of age.|$|E

In his Saga of Olav Tryggvason, Oddr Snorrason writes that Tryggvason excavated two mounds on Karmøy, revealing the bones of a man in one and those of <b>a</b> <b>cow</b> in the other. Local legends contradict Augvald's burial at Avaldsnes, stating instead that he was buried in Ferkingstad, {{on the south side of}} the 12th-century churchyard. A large memorial stone, still standing, was raised outside the churchyard in memory of Augvald.|$|E

Several villagers independently described an animal that, as recently as 1976, had entered their village, was the size of <b>a</b> <b>cow,</b> was dark pigmented, grunted a lot, and when threatened, fled underwater. No known animal on Madagascar fits the description but the animal seemed remarkably like a hippopotamus.|$|E

50|$|The hydrolyzed {{nature of}} fish protein powder (low {{molecular}} weight profile) leads {{it to be}} used in hypoallergenic applications such as infant formulas.

For infants who have a high-risk of <b>a</b> <b>cows</b> milk allergy but cannot be fed breast milk, there is low-quality evidence suggesting that hydrolyzed protein-based formula may reduce the risk of <b>a</b> <b>cows</b> milk allergy compared to cow milk protein formula.|$|R

5|$|While some culinary {{practices}} and dishes have been imported from its British neighbors, uniquely Welsh cuisine grew principally from {{the lives of}} Welsh working people, {{largely as a result}} of their isolation from outside culinary influences and the need to produce food based on the limited ingredients they could produce or afford. Welsh Celts and their more recent Welsh descendants originally practiced transhumance, moving their cattle to higher elevations in the summer and back to their home base in the winter. Once they settled to homesteads, a family would have generally eaten meat from a pig primarily, keeping <b>a</b> <b>cow</b> for dairy products.|$|E

Frustrated, several drunken miners then stole a work train and steamed into Victor. They {{caught up with the}} group of fleeing deputies, and a gun battle broke out. One deputy and one miner died, a man on each side was wounded, and six strikers were captured by the deputies. The miners subsequently captured three officials of the Strong mine who had been present when the shafthouse was blown up. A formal prisoner exchange later freed all prisoners on both sides.|$|E
