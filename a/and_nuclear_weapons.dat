5|$|At this point, McCormack {{had become}} {{apprehensive}} about his career, but in early 1947 {{a new and}} exciting opportunity opened up. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 had created the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to oversee {{research and development of}} nuclear power <b>and</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> The Act had created a statutory position inside the AEC called the Director of Military Applications, which the AEC commissioners envisaged as a staff post responsible for military planning and policy formulation.

5|$|Fermi {{was fond}} of {{pointing}} out that Alessandro Volta, working in his laboratory, could have {{had no idea where}} the study of electricity would lead. Fermi is generally remembered for his work on nuclear power <b>and</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons,</b> especially the creation of the first nuclear reactor, and the development of the first atomic and hydrogen bombs. His scientific work has stood the test of time. This includes his theory of beta decay, his work with non-linear systems, his discovery of the effects of slow neutrons, his study of pion-nucleon collisions, and his Fermi–Dirac statistics. His speculation that a pion was not a fundamental particle pointed the way towards the study of quarks and leptons.|$|E

5|$|Responsibility {{for nuclear}} power <b>and</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> was {{transferred}} from the Manhattan District to the United States Atomic Energy Commission on 1 January 1947. On 29 January 1947, Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson and Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal issued a joint directive creating the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP) to control the military aspects of nuclear weapons. Groves was appointed its chief on 28 February 1947. In April, AFSWP moved from the New War Department Building to the fifth floor of the Pentagon. Groves had already made a start on the new mission by creating Sandia Base in 1946.|$|E

In 1979, Britain considered replacing its Polaris submarines with either the Trident submarines or alternatively the Tornado as the main bearer of its nuclear deterrent. Although the UK proceeded with Trident, several Tornado squadrons based in Germany were assigned to SACEUR to deter a major Soviet offensive with both conventional <b>and</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons,</b> namely the WE.177 nuclear bomb, which was retired in 1998. German and Italian Tornados are capable of delivering US B61 nuclear bombs, which are made available through NATO.|$|E

5|$|Australia was {{particularly}} interested in developing atomic energy as the country was then thought to have no oil and only limited supplies of coal. Plans for atomic power were considered along with hydroelectricity {{as part of the}} post-war Snowy Mountains Scheme. There was also interest in the production of uranium-235 and plutonium for nuclear weapons. The Australian government had hopes of collaboration with Britain on nuclear energy <b>and</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> Unlike Canada, Australia was not a party to the Quebec Agreement or its successor, the 1948 Modus Vivendi, and Britain would not share technical information with Australia for fear that it might jeopardise its far more important relationship with the United States. The Americans were reluctant to share secret information with Australia after the Venona project revealed the extent of Soviet espionage activities in Australia.|$|E
5|$|The psionic and technologically adept Protoss {{have access}} to {{powerful}} units and machinery and advanced technologies such as energy shields and localized warp capabilities, powered by their psionic traits. However, their forces have lengthy and expensive manufacturing processes, encouraging players to follow a strategy {{of the quality of}} their units over the quantity. The insectoid Zerg possess entirely organic units and structures, which can be produced quickly and at a far cheaper cost to resources, but are accordingly weaker, relying on sheer numbers and speed to overwhelm enemies. The humanoid Terrans provide a middle ground between the other two races, providing units that are versatile and flexible.

5|$|Many {{contemporary}} uses {{of uranium}} exploit its unique nuclear properties. Uranium-235 {{is the only}} naturally occurring fissile isotope, which makes it widely used in nuclear power plants <b>and</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> However, because of the tiny amounts found in nature, uranium needs to undergo enrichment so that enough uranium-235 is present. Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is fertile, meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor. Another fissile isotope, uranium-233, can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology. Uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons; uranium-235 {{and to a lesser}} degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons. Depleted uranium (238U) is used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating. Uranium is used as a colorant in uranium glass, producing lemon yellow to green colors. Uranium glass fluoresces green in ultraviolet light. It was also used for tinting and shading in early photography.|$|E
