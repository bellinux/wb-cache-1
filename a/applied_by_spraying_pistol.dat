40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to select {{effective}} and safe microbiocides for the disinfection and protection of historical wooden surfaces at the former Auschwitz II-Birkenau concentration and extermination camp. We tested seven active compounds against bacteria and moulds, of which didecyldimethylammonium chloride and N-(3 -aminopropyl) -N-dodecylpropane- 1, 3 -diamine were effective even at 0. 02 %– 2 %. Subsequently, eight microbiocides containing the selected active ingredients were chosen and applied three times on the surface of wood samples colonized by bacteria and moulds. ABM- 1 and ABM- 2 — 6 % solution; Rocima 101 — 8 %; Preventol R 80 — 12 %; Acticide 706 LV— 15 % and Boramon— 30 % were the most effective disinfectants.

40|$|Fabric {{treatments}} imparting bactericide {{characteristics are}} highly desired by the apparel, home furnishings, and medical industries. However, conventional processes used to impart such characteristics {{have a major}} drawback. That is, these effects are not permanent and {{the properties of the}} material may be altered. Laundering or wearing of the treated fabric causes leaching or erosion of the agents responsible for imparting the desired characteristics. This problem has resulted in research efforts to develop durable treatments. This includes microencapsulated active agents that operate by controlled release such as silver salts, oxidising agents, reducing agents, and various types of antibacterial products. Another possibility is to use of graft polymers, homopolymers, and/ or copolymerization on to the fibre of antibacterial properties, or by chemical modification of the fibre by formation of covalent bonds with quaternary ammonium salts having expected bactericide properties. This work aimed at binding to the textile fibres active components that are expected to have anti-microbial activity. In this work the components tested were respectively: a microencapsulated anti-bacterial product, a microcapsule with a grafted quaternary ammonium salt, and a soluble quaternary ammonium salt covalently linked to the fibre. The efficiency of microencapsulation and the release of the antibacterial product was evaluated by anti-bacterial activity. The microcapsule with a quaternary ammonium salt grafted to its wall, and the soluble quaternary ammonium salt, were <b>applied</b> <b>by</b> exhaustion and impregnation methods. The efficiency of the process was evaluated by anti-bacterial activity {{and in the case of}} the soluble product, Nitrogen content was also determined. The microcapsules were also <b>applied</b> <b>by</b> <b>spraying</b> and <b>by</b> impregnation.

40|$|Thermal spray {{processing}} {{has been}} used {{for a number of years}} to cost-effecticely apply TBC's for a wide range of heat engine applications. In particular, bond coats are <b>applied</b> <b>by</b> plasma <b>spray</b> and HVOF techniques and partially-stabilized zirconia top coats are <b>applied</b> <b>by</b> plasma <b>spray</b> methods. Thermal spray involves melting and rapid transport of the molten particles to the substrate, where high-rate solidification and coating build-up occur. It is the very nature of this melt processing that leads to the unique layered microstructure, as well as the apparent imperfections, so readily identified with thermal spray. Modeling the process, process-induced residual stresses, and thermal conductivity will be discussed in light of a new understanding of porosity and its anisotropy. Microcracking can be understood using new approaches, allowing a fuller view of the processing-performance connection. Detailed electron microscopic, novel neutron diffraction and fracture analysis of the deposits can lead to a better understanding of how overall microstructure can be controlled to influence critical properties of the deposited TBC system...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a field investigation of repairs to two highway bridges. The repairs were <b>applied</b> <b>by</b> <b>spraying</b> onto unpropped compression members of the bridges. Two categories of commercial repair materials were used, low stiffness materials relative to the substrate (E-rm E-sub) The repair materials also represented a range of other properties such as strength, density, shrinkage, and creep. The results show that repairs applied with relatively stiff materials, E-rm > E-sub, display efficient structural interaction with the structure. High stiffness repairs are effective in redistributing shrinkage strain to the substrate and attracting external loading in the long term. Low stiffness repair materials (E-rm < E-sub) {{are much more likely to}} undergo tensile cracking due to restrained shrinkage. Low stiffness repairs are ineffective in redistributing strain. 2000 (C) Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
