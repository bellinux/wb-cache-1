30|$|In summary, we have {{fabricated}} a p-type multi-layered MoTe 2 transistor by transferring MoTe 2 onto fabricated source-drain electrode in air. Vacuum- and temperature-dependent in situ charge transport measurements {{demonstrate that}} the usual p-type conductance of multi-layered MoTe 2 transistor is not its intrinsic properties, which is caused by oxygen/water redox couple doping in air. When the MoTe 2 transistor is heated in vacuum to remove <b>absorbates,</b> it exhibits n-type conductance, which is attributed to tellurium vacancies in MoTe 2 and is its intrinsic transport property. Both p-type and n-type MoTe 2 transistors show smaller effective Schottky barrier height, which is partially due to the modification by <b>absorbates.</b> The lowered effective Schottky barrier is beneficial to achieving a high-performance MoTe 2 transistor. Based on these findings, we fabricate a complementary inverter with gain values as high as 9.|$|R

In the presence of adsorbates, stress induced by could also be high enough for such reconstruction. The mechanism of {{the reconstruction of the}} two processes would be similar. The reconstruction due to adsorbates is easily recognized by deviation from stress-induced vs. coverage relationship. One example is shown in figure 5 and 6. It shows clearly the difference between stress-induced behavior of silicon compared with oxygen or carbon <b>absorbate</b> on Ni(100) surface. S/Ni(100) system reaches very high stress at the coverage of ~0.3.

It is assumed that the concentration of soluble trace gases in the atmosphere varies in a vertical direction. In the analysis the accumulation of the <b>absorbate</b> in {{the bulk of the}} falling rain droplet was accounted for. The problem is solved in the approximation of a thin concentration boundary layer in the droplet and in the surrounding air. It was assumed that the bulk of a droplet, beyond the diffusion boundary layer, is completely mixed and that concentration of the <b>absorbate</b> is homogeneous and time dependent in the bulk. By combining the generalized similarity transformation method with Duhamel’s theorem, the system of transient conjugate equations of convective diffusion for <b>absorbate</b> transport in liquid and gaseous phases with time-dependent boundary conditions is reduced to a linear-convolution Volterra integral equation of the second kind, which is solved numerically.

The hypertonic <b>absorbate</b> generated an osmotic pressure which created a fluid tension in the crypt lumen. This was monitored as a suction tension in colonic luminal gels of 45. 3 ± 3 cmH 2 O with 2. 5 % gels and 725 ± 145 cmH 2 O with 10 % gels.

Previous theoretical work from our laboratory has shown that these modulators, such as salts in ion-exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography and organic modifiers in reversed-phase chromatography, can absorb nonlinearly, giving rise to gradient deformation. Consequently, adsorbate peaks that elute {{in the vicinity of}} the head of the deformed gradient may exhibit unusual shapes, form shoulders, and/or be concentrated. These effects for a reversed-phase sorbent with aqueous acetonitrile (ACN) as the modulator are verified experimentally. Gradient deformation is demonstrated experimentally and agrees with simulations based on ACN isotherm parameters that are independently determined from batch equilibrium studies using the layer model. Unusual <b>absorbate</b> peak shapes were found experimentally for single-component injections of phenylalanine, similar to those calculated by the simulations.

Like most 2 D materials, multi-layered 2 H-MoTe 2 has very high surface-to-volume ratio, making it sensitive to various influences in the surrounding environment. Thus, it is difficult to obtain its intrinsic properties. The surface and interface of 2 D materials and related devices have always been research hotspots in order to achieve higher performance. Here, we fabricate a multi-layered 2 H-MoTe 2 transistor, whose source and drain electrode layers are fabricated, and then, a multi-layered MoTe 2 sample is transferred to bridge the source and drain electrodes as a transistor channel. The whole MoTe 2 sample is exposed in air, including the channel and contact part, which is advantageous to investigating the influence of <b>absorbates</b> on charge transport properties of multi-layered MoTe 2 transistor. Measurements of vacuum- and temperature-dependent charge transport are conducted. The experimental data show that multi-layered MoTe 2 transistor is an n-type in terms of intrinsic conductance. However, the device exposed in air can be doped by <b>absorbates</b> and converted to air-stable p-type transistor. We infer that the intrinsic n-type conductance of multi-layered MoTe 2 transistor is attributed to tellurium (Te) vacancies, which is confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The conversion to p-type conductance in air {{can be explained by the}} fact that oxygen and water absorbed in air can induce electron transfer from MoTe 2 to oxygen/water redox couple, which converts n-type multi-layered MoTe 2 transistor to p-type. Finally, based on the n-type and p-type multi-layered MoTe 2 transistors, we demonstrate a complementary inverter, which shows symmetric input/output behavior and gain values of 9 at VDD[*]=[*] 5  V.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT At the ultrastructural level, epithelia {{performing}} solute-linked {{water transport}} possess long, narrow channels open {{at one end}} and closed at the other, which may constitute the fluid transport route (e. g., lateral intercellular spaces, basal infoldings, intracellular canaliculi, and brush-border microvilli). Active solute transport into such folded structures would establish standing osmotic gradients, causing a progressive approach to osmotic equilibrium along the channel's length. The behavior of a simple standing-gradient flow system has therefore been analyzed mathematically because of its potential physiological significance. The osmolarity of the fluid emerging from the channel's open end depends upon five parameters: channel length, radius, and water permeability, and solute transport rate and diffusion coefficient. For ranges of values of these parameters encountered experimentally in epithelia, the emergent osmolarity is found by calculation to range from isotonic to a few times isotonic; i. e., the range encountered in epithelial <b>absorbates</b> and secretions.

While the influence of trap electrode geometries on electric field noise has been studied in patch potential and surface adsorbate models, only smooth surfaces are accounted for by current theory. The effects of roughness, a ubiquitous feature of surface electrodes, are poorly understood. We investigate its impact on electric field noise by deriving a rough-surface Green's function and evaluating its effects on adsorbate-surface binding energies. At cryogenic temperatures, heating rate contributions from adsorbates are predicted to exhibit an exponential sensitivity to local surface curvature, leading to either a large net enhancement or suppression over smooth surfaces. For typical experimental parameters, orders-of-magnitude variations in total heating rates can occur depending on the spatial distribution of <b>absorbates.</b> Through careful engineering of electrode surface profiles, our results suggests that heating rates can be tuned over orders of magnitudes. by Kuan-Yu Lin.
