On 27 October 2000, he staged the Real Turner Prize Show <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> End Gallery in his home, {{concurrent}} with three shows with the same title in England (London, Falmouth and Dartington) and one in Germany in protest against the Tate Gallery's Turner Prize. Other Australian Stuckists include Godfrey Blow, who exhibited in The Stuckists Punk Victorian. In 2005 Mike Mayhew also founded The Christchurch Stuckists in New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Mick St. John, {{a private}} investigator, dreams of being interviewed {{by a woman}} off-camera, where he reveals that he is 90 years old, and that unlike other vampires, he has {{standards}} and does not hunt women, children or innocents. Mick's job leads him {{to the scene of}} the murder of a young woman, where Beth, a reporter for the online newspaper BuzzWire, notices two large puncture wounds on the woman's neck. While walking around the scene, she meets Mick and tells him he looks very familiar, but he insists that they do not know each other. Beth gives the murder article a vampire theme, using the puncture wounds as inspiration. The article makes Josef, a 400-year-old vampire friend of Mick's, concerned for the safety of vampires. To get more information on the murder, Mick goes to the morgue, where his friend Guillermo (Jacob Vargas) supplies him with blood. Mick does not detect any traces of vampire contact on the dead woman, eliminating them as her reason of death. Mick then comes across Beth <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> woman's apartment, where they find a necklace with a vial of blood inside.|$|E

25|$|The bird the {{children}} have found has died, and {{the children}}, assisted by the adults, hold a funeral for it. Virginia is aware that she {{and the little girl}} are far more invested in the funeral than Vanessa's boys, who are probably laughing at the females behind their backs. As Virginia stares longingly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> bird she has an epiphany: her character, Clarissa Dalloway, is not like Virginia, and would not commit suicide. Like the bird's funeral bed, Clarissa represents -to Virginia- an uncaring, even foolish thing. As such, Clarissa will represent the death bed (the counterpoint) to the character who Virginia will have commit suicide.|$|E
25|$|For reasons {{which remain}} unclear, in 1869 Wagner republished the essay with an {{addendum}} {{as long as}} the original, and under his own name. The first part was reprinted as in 1850, with some references toned down, as in the example already given. With a confidence lacking in the original frenetic effort, the second (new) part seeks to contextualise Wagner’s anti-Jewish feelings in the setting of later nineteenth-century German politics, whilst continuing to snipe <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> Mendelssohn and Meyerbeer and bringing in other dead musicians, including Schumann, on Wagner’s side. He also attacked by name the critic Eduard Hanslick, bringing in reference to the latter's Jewish descent (which Hanslick then attempted to deny).|$|E

25|$|Israel is {{a popular}} {{destination}} for medical tourism. Many medical tourists to Israel come from Europe, particularly the former Soviet Union, {{as well as the}} United States, Australia, Cyprus, and South Africa. Medical tourists come to Israel for a variety of surgical procedures and therapies, including bone marrow transplants, heart surgery and catheterization, oncological and neurological treatments, orthopedic procedures, car accident rehabilitation, and in-vitro fertilization. Israel's popularity as a destination for medical tourism stems from its status as a developed country with a high-quality level of medical care, {{while at the same time}} having lower medical costs than many other developed countries. Israel is particularly popular as a destination for bone marrow transplants among Cypriots, as the procedure is not available in Cyprus, and for orthopedic procedures among Americans, as the cost of orthopedic procedures in Israel is about half that of in the United States. Israel is a particularly popular destination for people seeking IFV treatments. Medical tourists in Israel use both public and private hospitals, and all major Israeli hospitals offer medical tourism packages which typically cost far less than comparable procedures than in facilities elsewhere with a similarly high standard of care. In 2014, it was estimated that roughly 50,000 medical tourists came to Israel annually. There are reports that these medical tourists obtain preferential treatment, to the detriment of local patients. In addition, some people come to Israel to visit health resorts <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> Sea, and on Lake Kinneret.|$|E

As {{his friend}} Charles Chauncey Burr wrote, [...] "Many times, {{after the death}} of his beloved wife, was he found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> hour of a winter night, sitting beside her tomb almost frozen in the snow". Shortly after Virginia's death, Poe courted several other women, including Nancy Richmond of Lowell, Massachusetts, Sarah Helen Whitman of Providence, Rhode Island, and childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster in Richmond. Even so, Frances Sargent Osgood, whom Poe also attempted to woo, believed [...] "that [...] was the only woman whom he ever loved".|$|E
500|$|After the sudden, inexplicable {{death of}} a cow on the ranch, Homer sends Lonnie to town to bring Hud to the ranch for his opinion. [...] Lonnie, finding Hud {{just in time to}} take the blame for Hud's tryst with a married woman, protests Hud's putting him in a {{dangerous}} situation as they return to the ranch, with Hud driving over Alma's flowers as they arrive. [...] <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> animal, Hud shoots several buzzards to scare the flock away against his father's protestations that they keep the land clean and shooting them is illegal. [...] Hud states his immunity to laws that inconvenience him, setting the tone of his overall demeanor. [...] Hud is annoyed by his father's decision to summon the state veterinarian, and suggests selling the animals to other ranchers before the news spreads; otherwise, government agents will kill all the cattle and destroy everything they have worked for. He blames his father for not realizing that the cheap Mexican cattle were sick before he bought them. Adhering to his principles, Homer ignores Hud's idea and waits for the veterinarian. Upon his arrival, the state veterinarian immediately issues a legally binding State Livestock Transfer Order directing the quarantine of the ranch for a possible foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. This freezes the movement of all livestock to or from the Bannon ranch, while they await the test results.|$|E
