5|$|An author for the South Asia Analysis Group {{explained}} the protests as expressions of middle-class <b>angst</b> {{arising out of}} a collapse of a social contract {{between them and the}} liberal state.|$|E
5|$|Press Gang {{has proved}} to be a series that can {{transport}} you back to how you felt as a teenager, sharper that the world but with as much <b>angst</b> as acute wit... Never again can a show get away with talking down to children or writing sloppily for them. Press Gang, possibly the best show in the world.|$|E
5|$|Squall had {{a varied}} {{reaction}} from critics, with some judging him poorly {{compared to other}} Final Fantasy heroes (due to his coldness and <b>angst)</b> and others praising his character development. Nevertheless, the character has been popular, and his relationship with Rinoa resulted in praise.|$|E
5|$|Béart {{is given}} an {{ethereal}} quality by Lubtchansky's cinematography and lighting, and she subtly portrays Marie's detachment and vulnerability. In {{the latter part}} of the film Béart is dressed in grey and looks tired and wan, showing Marie's ageing and <b>angst.</b> Béart says she made deliberate use of silence in playing the part. Radziwiłowicz's performance allows the viewer to sympathise with Julien despite the character's initial dislikeable nature. Brochet as Madame X has a cool ease and grace.|$|E
5|$|Governor Breathitt died of {{tuberculosis}} on February 21, 1834, and Morehead {{was sworn in}} as governor the following day. The replacement of a Democratic governor with one from the rival National Republican party caused a great deal of <b>angst</b> among Democrats, but the ascendancy of Democrat James Guthrie to president of the state senate and Morehead's willingness to retain Breathitt's secretary of state, Lewis Saunders, did much to allay their fears.|$|E
5|$|Joseph's role in {{the show}} is that of troubled surgeon – the {{resultant}} <b>angst</b> of his brother's attempted suicide and his own anally retentive personality lead to the revelation the character suffers from Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). His major storylines included an accidental drugs overdose, and a relationship with fellow surgical registrar Jac Naylor, who cheated on him with his own father. Roberts' performance resulted in a longlist nomination for the Most Popular Newcomer award at the 2006 National Television Awards.|$|E
5|$|While Star Trek {{in general}} {{features}} few overt references to religion, {{there is a}} clear recognition that a laying aside of past hurts is necessary for peace, similar to the concept of shalom in Judaism. Shatner regretted that Kirk's <b>angst</b> at being outmoded was minimized in the final print. A scene where Spock asks Kirk if they have grown so old and inflexible they have outlived their usefulness had two meanings: it was as much Nimoy asking Shatner as it was their characters.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 Reich {{bought an}} {{oscillograph}} and attached it {{to friends and}} students, who volunteered to touch and kiss each other while Reich read the tracings. One of the volunteers was a young Willy Brandt, the future chancellor of Germany. At the time, {{he was married to}} Reich's secretary, Gertrude Gaasland, and was living in Norway to organize protests against the Nazis. Reich also took measurements from the patients of a psychiatric hospital near Oslo, including catatonic patients, with the permission of the hospital's director. Reich described the oscillograph experiments in 1937 in Experimentelle Ergebniße Über Die Elektrische Funktion von Sexualität und <b>Angst</b> (The Bioelectrical Investigation of Sexuality and Anxiety).|$|E
5|$|In 1996, filmmaker Jem Cohen {{recorded}} Smith playing acoustic {{songs for}} the short film Lucky Three: An Elliott Smith Portrait. Two of these songs would appear on his next album, Either/Or, which was another Kill Rock Stars release. Either/Or came out in 1997 to favorable reviews. The album found Smith venturing further into full instrumentation, with several songs containing bass guitar, drums, keyboards, and electric guitars, all played by Smith. The album title {{was derived from the}} two-volume book of the same name by Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, whose works generally deal with themes such as existential despair, <b>angst,</b> death, and God.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Meegar (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), a shy {{delivery}} boy {{who lives}} with his mother (Marylouise Burke), arrives late for work and delivers a package to an office building where he comes across Bethany (Diane Davis), a receptionist with whom he's infatuated. Afterward, while in an elevator, Bethany notices Meegar has pictures of her on his cell phone. Meegar's <b>angst</b> then apparently causes the elevator to fall to the underground parking lot levels, killing all but Meegar. He is able to walk away unharmed, but is then startled as all the car alarms go off around him.|$|E
5|$|Although As I Lay Dying {{has stated}} on {{numerous}} occasions {{that all of the}} members of the group are practicing Christians, the band is usually described by media as being in the metalcore genre, not Christian metal. This is largely because the band's lyrics do not directly focus on pro-Christian themes the way many praise music bands do nor do they treat their music as a direct extension of their private Christian worship or proselytizing efforts. For example, not once do the names God or Jesus appear in any As I Lay Dying song, nor do any of their songs explicitly invoke Christian doctrine or quote the Bible. Most songs tend to address broader spiritual concepts like existential <b>angst</b> or the struggle between reason and spirituality.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} {{signed off}} on all of Zahorchak's proposals except for his call to remove four principals in exchange for up to $15million in federal grants that mandate leadership or staff changes {{as a condition for}} receiving the money. Zahorchak proposed transferring the principals from the Allen and Dieruff high schools, Central Elementary and Harrison-Morton Middle School to the district's nonprofit foundation, then use the federal grant money to open a special school for advanced placement and honors students. The committee did not vote or comment on the matter on October 14. Zahorchak said he still planned to pursue the plan but apologized for speaking to the media about it on October 12 before discussing it with the district and staff, a move that caused <b>angst</b> among the staff and some members of the public.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{has drawn}} {{influence}} {{from a number}} of musical genres. As a teenager, he mostly listened to 1960s folk and religious music, including the Christian singer-songwriter Larry Norman. For playing on his junior high baseball team, he was given Leon Russell's 1970 debut album, which he says influenced some of his vocalizing. Later in high school and in college, he discovered punk music (Black Flag), along with bands from other genres, such as the new wave band The Cars and the obscure <b>Angst.</b> While in Boston in 1984, before starting the Pixies, he listened to Hüsker Dü's Zen Arcade, The Spotlight Kid by Captain Beefheart, and I'm Sick of You, an Iggy Pop bootleg. Thompson was also greatly influenced by the Beatles self-titled 1968 release (known as White Album) with regards to the experimental nature of his compositions (especially those featured in Doolittle).|$|E
5|$|Under the {{guidance}} of writer-editor Stan Lee and artists/co-plotters such as Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, Marvel began its own rise to prominence. With an innovation that changed the comic-book industry, The Fantastic Four #1 initiated a naturalistic style of superheroes with human failings, fears, and inner demons, who squabbled and worried about the likes of rent-money. In contrast to the straitlaced archetypes of superheroes at the time, this ushered in a revolution. With dynamic artwork by Kirby, Steve Ditko, Don Heck, and others complementing Lee's colorful, catchy prose, the new style became popular among college students who could identify with the <b>angst</b> and the irreverent nature of the characters such as Spider-Man, the X-Men and the Hulk during a time period of social upheaval {{and the rise of}} a youth counterculture.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 Chicago {{experienced}} {{two major}} race riots. Triggered by Civil Rights struggles and <b>angst,</b> more riots followed {{in subsequent years}} and the Black Power movement came into fruition. Artists began to explore ways to express black pride, self-determination and self-reliance leading in 1966 to the Organization of Black American Culture (OBAC). Artist Norman Parish asked Jarrell to attend a meeting for OBAC's Artists' Workshop. The meetings would consist of artists bringing their work to be critiqued and reflect on ideas of the black experience in art, leading to the concept behind Wall of Respect. The mural consisted of African American heroes and personalities, each artist deciding who should be depicted in their section. Sylvia Abernathy designed the layout, giving Jarrell a 12 × 14 foot space to share with photographer Bill Abernathy. Jarrell focused on a favorite theme, rhythm and blues, and featured portrayals of James Brown, B.B. King, Billie Holiday, Muddy Waters, Aretha Franklin and Dinah Washington. The Artists' Workshop would sour {{towards the end of}} the project: there were controversies stemming from the painting in Norman Parish's section, conflicts regarding copyrights being sold without permission, disagreements on law enforcement involvement, as well as deceit. Nevertheless the Wall was considered a success, triggering the creation of liberation themed murals in Chicago and beyond.|$|E

25|$|Emo {{has been}} {{associated}} with a stereotype of emotion, sensitivity, shyness, introversion or <b>angst.</b> Other stereotypes include depression, self-harm and suicide.|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} Mia Thermopolis' {{adolescent}} turmoil as an average teenager and a princess of royal descent is chronicled in her on-going journal, where she explores topics of teenage <b>angst,</b> love, and betrayal through an opinionated eye.|$|E
25|$|Dean quickly {{followed}} up {{his role in}} Eden with a starring role as Jim Stark in Rebel Without a Cause, a film that {{would prove to be}} hugely popular among teenagers. The film has been cited as an accurate representation of teenage <b>angst.</b>|$|E
25|$|Themes within Kiedis' {{repertoire}} include {{love and}} friendship, teenage <b>angst,</b> good-time aggression, various sexual topics and {{the link between}} sex and music, political and social commentary (Native American issues in particular), romance, loneliness, globalization and the cons of fame and Hollywood, poverty, drugs, alcohol, dealing with death, and California.|$|E
25|$|The Catcher in the Rye is a 1951 {{novel by}} J. D. Salinger. A classic novel {{originally}} published for adults, {{it has since}} become popular with adolescent readers for its themes of teenage <b>angst</b> and alienation. It has been translated into {{almost all of the}} world's major languages.|$|E
25|$|Kaleidoscope {{was also}} praised by the singer of Suede, Brett Anderson. Erasure's Andy Bell cited {{it as one}} of his {{favourite}} :"More commercial offering from Siouxsie was much more up my street - and consequently, as with all my favourite teen <b>angst</b> albums, I learnt all of the songs inside out and backwards".|$|E
25|$|With the {{progression}} of the second season—which was highlighted by divorce, blackmail, revenge, character revamps, and much <b>angst</b> between couples—the show had begun to secure a reputation for darker, more extraordinary story lines. This kind of writing would become standard for the series throughout the remainder of its run. The series ended on May 24, 1999 after 226 episodes.|$|E
25|$|The {{family is}} the agent to which {{capitalist}} production delegates the psychological repression of the desires of the child. Psychological repression is distinguished from social oppression insofar as it works unconsciously. Through it, Deleuze and Guattari argue, parents transmit their <b>angst</b> and irrational fears to their child and bind the child's sexual desires to feelings of shame and guilt.|$|E
25|$|The plan emphasises {{speed and}} {{overwhelming}} firepower: armored formations and accompanying infantry would advance into eastern Pakistan with limited goals {{in terms of}} distance {{and in terms of}} duration. The plan reportedly has a significant air support component. From the Indian perspective, the plan has the added virtue of accentuating Pakistani discomfiture and <b>angst,</b> which in theory may have some deterrent value.|$|E
25|$|Meena Kumari {{was also}} a talented Urdu poetess under the {{pseudonym}} Naaz. According to Naushad Ali, Kumari's poetry clearly reflected her <b>angst.</b> Haunting, crystalline, and precisely observed, Kumari's poetry reveals a side of her personality that was rarely on display in her films. It proved {{that she was a}} much more sensitive and self-aware woman than her fans tend to realize.|$|E
25|$|Heideggerians {{regarded}} Søren Kierkegaard as, by far, {{the greatest}} philosophical contributor to Heidegger's own existentialist concepts. Heidegger's concepts of anxiety (<b>Angst)</b> and mortality draw on Kierkegaard and are {{indebted to the}} way in which the latter lays out the importance of our subjective relation to truth, our existence in the face of death, the temporality of existence, and the importance of passionate affirmation of one's individual being-in-the-world.|$|E
25|$|A Hollywood film {{inspired}} by a book written about its capture, The Bridge at Remagen, was made in 1969. The actor George Segal played the character Lieutenant Phil Hartman, loosely based on Timmermann. Ben Gazzara as Sergeant Angelo was very loosely based on Sgt. Alexander A. Drabik the first soldier across the bridge. The movie portrayed the battle {{with a lot of}} <b>angst</b> and bloodshed contrary to real events.|$|E
25|$|The bay's {{marine park}} zoning plan was renewed in 2008. Despite <b>angst</b> from both {{commercial}} and recreational fishers, draft Queensland Government plans indicate further fishing restrictions aiming to protect more than 15% of important marine and coastal environments. Artificial reefs {{could be placed}} in Moreton Bay to ease the concerns of fishermen who fear they are being forced out. The Queensland Government will spend 1million on research, planning and {{construction of a new}} concrete reef in the bay.|$|E
25|$|The {{adolescent}} <b>angst</b> novels La Tumba (The Tomb, 1964) and De Perfil (Profile View, 1966), by José Agustín, stylistically {{announced a}} new generation of novelist, writing in the contemporary popular idiom of society, presenting stories of life as lived. The styles of writing of La Onda provided Mexican young people with a literature pertinent to their Latin American cultural experience of life en la ciudad. The writers were published under the library title Literatura de La Onda (Literature of The Wave), by the Joaquín Mortiz publishing house.|$|E
25|$|A Hell of a Woman {{was also}} adapted in French as Série noire (1979) by Alain Corneau, with dialogues by French Oulipo writer Georges Pérec. This noir {{masterpiece}} {{set in the}} grim Paris outskirts features a 16-year-old Marie Trintignant's debut performance, {{as well as what}} is generally agreed to be Patrick Dewaere's finest performance. Dewaere conveys a tragic dimension to his manic portrayal of a mediocre door-to-door salesman, at one point repeatedly bashing his head against a car in an effort to exorcise his <b>angst</b> and guilt.|$|E
25|$|Hobgoblin is a 1981 {{novel by}} horror and {{suspense}} writer John Coyne that followed on the <b>angst</b> about the Egbert incident, D, and fantasy role-playing games in general. It {{is about a}} young man, Scott Gardiner, who is traumatized by {{the sudden death of}} his father and by his mother's decision to take a job as caretaker of an isolated estate called Ballycastle. Ostracized by his peers at the local high school, Scott takes refuge in Hobgoblin, a role-playing game based on Ancient Celtic cults.|$|E
25|$|The final films, {{from around}} 1977 until his death, were more varied, with {{international}} actors sometimes {{used and the}} stock company disbanded, although the casts of some films were still filled with Fassbinder regulars. He became increasingly more idiosyncratic in terms of plot, form and subject matter in movies like The Marriage of Maria Braun (1979), The Third Generation (1979) and Querelle (1982). He also articulated his themes in the bourgeois milieu with his trilogy about women in post-fascist Germany: The Marriage of Maria Braun (1979), The <b>Angst</b> of Veronica Voss and Lola.|$|E
25|$|For the 1958 NFL season, the Packers, {{with five}} future hall of famers {{playing on the}} team, {{finished}} {{with a record of}} 1–10–1, the worst in Packer history. The players were dispirited, the Packer shareholders were disheartened, and the Green Bay community was enraged. The <b>angst</b> in Green Bay extended to the NFL as a whole, as the financial viability and the very existence of the Green Bay Packer franchise were in jeopardy. On February 2, 1959, Vince Lombardi accepted the position of head coach and general manager of the Green Bay Packers.|$|E
25|$|Psychologists such as John B. Watson, Robert Plutchik, and Paul Ekman have {{suggested}} {{that there is only}} a small set of basic or innate emotions and that fear is one of them. This hypothesized set includes such emotions as acute stress reaction, anger, <b>angst,</b> anxiety, fright, horror, joy, panic, and sadness. Fear is closely related to, but should be distinguished from, the emotion anxiety, which occurs as the result of threats that are perceived to be uncontrollable or unavoidable. The fear response serves survival by generating appropriate behavioral responses, so it has been preserved throughout evolution.|$|E
25|$|Many 20th-century philosophers, both theistic and atheistic, and theologians drew {{concepts}} from Kierkegaard, {{including the}} notions of <b>angst,</b> despair, {{and the importance of}} the individual. His fame as a philosopher grew tremendously in the 1930s, in large part because the ascendant existentialist movement pointed to him as a precursor, although later writers celebrated him as a highly significant and influential thinker in his own right. Since Kierkegaard was raised as a Lutheran, he was commemorated as a teacher in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church on 11 November and in the Calendar of Saints of the Episcopal Church with a feast day on 8 September.|$|E
