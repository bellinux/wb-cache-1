5|$|Titanics {{survivors}} {{were rescued}} around 04:00 on 15April by the RMS Carpathia, which had steamed {{through the night}} at high speed and <b>at</b> <b>considerable</b> <b>risk,</b> as the ship had to dodge numerous icebergs en route. Carpathias lights were first spotted around 03:30, which greatly cheered the survivors, though it took several more hours for everyone to be brought aboard. The 30 or more men on collapsible B finally managed to board two other lifeboats, but one survivor died just before the transfer was made. Collapsible A was also in trouble and was now nearly awash; many of those aboard (maybe more than a half) had died overnight. The remaining survivors– {{an unknown number of}} men, estimated to be between 10–11 and more than 20, and one woman– were transferred from A into another lifeboat, leaving behind three bodies in the boat, which was left to drift away. It was recovered a month later by the White Star liner Oceanic, with the bodies still aboard.|$|E
5|$|Disobeying {{his orders}} {{to return to}} Spithead, Walker made for Cadiz, {{gathered}} the convoy, and escorted them to Britain. It was a controversial action. The merchants claimed the cargoes were worth £1 million, {{and would have been}} <b>at</b> <b>considerable</b> <b>risk</b> from enemy vessels were it not for Walker's escort. However the Spanish authorities were greatly incensed, arresting five of Trustys officers while she was at Cadiz on charges of having smuggled the merchant's money out of the port, and demanding Walker be court-martialled. Walker justified himself by pointing to the imminent alliance between France and Spain, but despite the Lords of the Admiralty being sympathetic to his cause, he was found guilty of disobeying orders, and was dismissed from the navy. The Lords advised him to join the fleet despatched to the West Indies under Sir Hugh Cloberry Christian, but it was dispersed by gales and the ship Walker was travelling on returned to port. There it was suggested that he wait in Britain, and with the Spanish declaration of war, Walker was reinstated on the navy list in March 1797 by an order in council.|$|E

25|$|The {{field of}} island {{restoration}} is usually credited with having been started in New Zealand in the 1960s, but other smaller projects, {{such as the}} restoration of Nonsuch Island in Bermuda (which began in 1962) {{have been going on}} for almost as long. Nevertheless, the program undertaken by the Department of Conservation (DOC) {{is one of the largest}} in the world. It began on Cuvier Island, where ecologists removed stock, goats, feral cats and finally, in 1993, Pacific rats. The success of the project resulted in similar projects around New Zealand. The advantages to the DOC were considerable; in addition to protecting species endemic to smaller islands, like the magenta petrel, islands near the mainland, once restored, could act as habitat for species of birds that were unable to survive on the mainland. Species like the takahe, where the remaining wild population was <b>at</b> <b>considerable</b> <b>risk</b> from feral cats and dogs, could be moved to these islands to safeguard the species.|$|E

2500|$|Hip {{fracture}} {{patients are}} <b>at</b> <b>considerable</b> <b>risk</b> for thromboemoblism, blood clots that dislodge and {{travel in the}} bloodstream. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is when the blood in the leg veins clots and causes pain and swelling. This is very common after hip fracture as the circulation is stagnant and the blood is hypercoagulable {{as a response to}} injury. DVT can occur without causing symptoms. [...] A pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs when clotted blood from a DVT comes loose from the leg veins and passes up to the lungs. Circulation to parts of the lungs are cut off which can be very dangerous. Fatal PE may have an incidence of 2% after hip fracture and may contribute to illness and mortality in other cases.|$|E

Foreign military personnel were restricted from approaching the border to avoid clashes or other unwanted incidents. Signs in English and German provided notifications of the distance to the border to discourage accidental crossings. No such restriction applied to Western civilians, who were free {{to go up to the}} border line. There were no physical obstacles to stop them actually crossing it, and there were incidents of West Germans crossing the border to steal East German border markers as souvenirs (<b>at</b> <b>considerable</b> <b>risk,</b> since the East German border guards sought to prevent such [...] "provocations").|$|E
