40|$|The paper {{presents}} an {{adaptive neural network}} approach for the estimation of harmonic distortions and power quality in power networks. The neural estimator {{is based on the}} use of linear adaptive neural elements called <b>adalines</b> The learning parameter of the proposed algorithm is suitably adjusted to provide fast convergence and noise rejection for tracking distorted signals in the power networks. Several numerical tests have been conducted for the adaptive estimation of harmonic components, total harmonic distortions, power quality of simulated waveforms in power networks supplying converter loads and switched capacitors. Laboratory test results are also presented in support of the performance of the new algorithm. © 1998 Elsevier Science S. A. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Active Power Filters (APFs) {{are used}} for {{identifying}} and compensating for harmonic distortions in electric distribution systems. This paper investigates neural APF frameworks based on artificial neural networks. The first one is a neural approach of the Instantaneous Power Theory (IPT) where the instantaneous powers are decomposed in a linear manner. The second one is a neural diphase currents method based on the DQ-currents which are linearly decomposed. In these approaches, the instantaneous powers and currents are learned on-line with <b>Adalines.</b> The overall complexity of the neural frameworks is evaluated in terms of basic operators. Their complexity is equivalent than methods based on the conventional Instantaneous Power Theory (IPT), while their performances are superior. Simulation results demonstrate the applicability of neural approaches for the control of APF frameworks for power quality improvement...|$|R

There is confusion about whether Adeline Chinn Scott had children; a 2007 account by the Scott County History Museum said she had at least one son, Robert Johnson Scott. Meyers said that she was childless. There is also disagreement about the year of her death. Bevins writes that Adeline died in the 1833 cholera epidemic. Meyers wrote she died in 1836.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Pattern Recognition (PR) {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} classifying objects, often represented as vectors or as strings of symbols, into categories. The difficulty is to synthesize, and then to efficiently compute, the classification function that maps objects to categories, given that objects in a category can have widely varying input representations. In most instances, the task is known to the designer {{through a set of}} example patterns whose categories are known, and through general, a priori knowledge about the task, such as: "the category of an object is not changed when the object is slightly translated or rotated in space". Historically, the field of PR started with the early efforts in Neural Networks (Perceptrons, <b>Adalines</b> [...] .). While in the past, NNs have somewhat played the role of an outsider in PR, the recent progress in learning algorithms (and the availability of powerful hardware) have made them the method of choice for many PR application...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a Mirroring Neural Network {{architecture}} to perform non-linear dimensionality reduction and Object Recognition using a reduced lowdimensional characteristic vector. In addition to dimensionality reduction, the network also reconstructs (mirrors) the original high-dimensional input vector from the reduced low-dimensional data. The Mirroring Neural Network architecture has more number of processing elements (<b>adalines)</b> in the outer layers and the least number of elements in the central layer to form “converging-diverging ” shape in its configuration. Since this network is able to reconstruct the original image from {{the output of the}} innermost layer (which contains all the information about the input pattern), these outputs can be used as object signature to classify patterns. The network is trained to minimize the discrepancy between actual output and the input by back propagating the mean squared error from the output layer to the input layer. After successfully training the network, it can reduce the dimension of input vectors and mirror the patterns fed to it. The Mirroring Neural Network architecture gave very good results on various test patterns...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} speed sensorless {{technique}} for induction motor drives {{based on the}} retrieval and tracking of the rotor slot harmonics (RSH). The RSH related to the rotor speed is first extracted from the stator phase current signature by the adoption of two cascaded <b>ADALINEs</b> (ADAptive Linear Element), whose output is the estimated slot harmonic. Then, the frequency of this slot harmonic {{as well as the}} speed is estimated by using minor space analysis (MSA) EXIN neural networks, which work on-line to iteratively compute the frequency of the slot harmonics based on MUSIC spectrum estimation theory. Thanks to its sample-based learning and the reduced mean square frequency estimation error, the speed estimation is fast and accurate. The proposed sensorless technique has been experimentally tested on a suitably developed test set-up with a 2 -kW induction motor drive. It has been verified that this algorithm can track the rotor speed rapidly and accurately in a very wide speed range, working from rated speed down to 1. 3 % of it...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} speed sensorless {{technique}} for high performance induction motor drives {{based on the}} retrieval and tracking of the rotor slot harmonic. First, two cascaded <b>ADALINEs</b> (Adaptive Linear Elements) are used to extract the rotor slot harmonic (RSH) from the stator phase current signature, acting as adaptive filters, respectively in configuration band and notch, whose output consists of the RSH. Second, the MCA EXIN neurons are used to extract the eigenvector corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue of the autocorrelation matrix, which is formed by the ADALINEs' output sequence. Then, the slot frequency is estimated by using Pisarenko's theory with this retrieved minimum eigenvector, and subsequently {{the speed of the}} motor is estimated. Compared to the original Pisarenko's method however, not only the proposed algorithm can work recursively sample by sample, but the computational complexity and mean square frequency estimation error are largely reduced. The proposed sensorless technique has been experimentally tested on a suitably developed test set-up with a 2 -kW induction motor drive. It has been verified that this algorithm can track the rotor speed rapidly and accurately in a very wide speed range, working from rated speed down to 1. 3 % of it...|$|R
