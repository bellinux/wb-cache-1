5|$|As {{attachment}} theory {{offers a}} broad, far-reaching {{view of human}} functioning, it can enrich a therapist's understanding of patients and the therapeutic relationship rather than dictate a particular form of treatment. Some forms of psychoanalysis-based therapy for adults—within relational psychoanalysis and other approaches—also incorporate attachment theory <b>and</b> <b>patterns.</b> In {{the first decade of}} the 21st century, key concepts of attachment were incorporated into existing models of behavioural couple therapy, multidimensional family therapy and couple and family therapy. Specifically attachment-centred interventions have been developed, such as attachment-based family therapy and emotionally focused therapy.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies and moths {{are able}} to see ultra-violet (UV) light, and wing colours <b>and</b> <b>patterns</b> are principally {{observed}} by Lepidoptera in this region. The patterns seen on their wing under UV light differ considerably from those seen in normal light. The UV patterns act as visual cues which help differentiate between species {{for the purpose of}} mating. Studies have been carried out on Lepidoptera (mostly butterflies) wing patterns illuminated by UV light.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a critical review}} of <b>patterns</b> <b>and</b> <b>pattern</b> languages in human-computer interaction (HCI). In recent years, <b>patterns</b> <b>and</b> <b>pattern</b> languages have received considerable attention in HCI for their potential {{as a means for}} developing and communicating information and knowledge to support good design. This review examines the background to <b>patterns</b> <b>and</b> <b>pattern</b> languages in HCI, and seeks to locate pattern languages in relation to other approaches to interaction design. The review explores four key issues: what is a pattern? what is a pattern language? how are <b>patterns</b> <b>and</b> <b>pattern</b> languages used? <b>and</b> how are values reflected in the pattern-based approach to design? Following on from the review, a future research agenda is proposed for <b>patterns</b> <b>and</b> <b>pattern</b> languages in HCI. </p...|$|R
5|$|Cheating, where {{either a}} cleaner {{sometimes}} harms its client, or a predatory species mimics a cleaner, also occurs. Predatory cheating {{is analogous to}} Batesian mimicry, as where a harmless hoverfly mimics a stinging wasp, though with the tables turned. Some genuine cleaner fish, such as gobies and wrasse, have the same colours <b>and</b> <b>patterns,</b> in an example of convergent evolution. Mutual resemblance among cleaner fish is analogous to Mullerian mimicry, as where stinging bees and wasps mimic each other.|$|E
5|$|Coastal batik is {{produced}} in several areas of northern Java and Madura. In contrast to inland batik, coastal batiks have vibrant colours <b>and</b> <b>patterns</b> inspired by {{a wide range of}} cultures as a consequence of maritime trading. Recurring motifs include European flower bouquets, Chinese phoenix, and Persian peacocks. Noted coastal batiks are produced in Pekalongan, Cirebon, Lasem, Tuban, and Madura. Pekalongan has the most active batik industry.|$|E
5|$|In biology, natural {{selection}} {{can cause the}} development of patterns in living things for several reasons, including camouflage, sexual selection, and different kinds of signalling, including mimicry and cleaning symbiosis. In plants, the shapes, colours, <b>and</b> <b>patterns</b> of insect-pollinated flowers like the lily have evolved to attract insects such as bees. Radial patterns of colours and stripes, some visible only in ultraviolet light serve as nectar guides {{that can be seen}} at a distance.|$|E

5|$|Other {{defensive}} {{strategies are}} {{the use of}} camouflage, fleeing, and aggression. Some species have adopted colourings, shapes, <b>and</b> <b>patterns</b> that {{make it difficult for}} predators that hunt by sight to detect them. They tend to be dull shades of brown, grey, and green that blend into their background, and desert species tend to be pale. Some species can fly, but the mode of flight tends to be clumsy, so the most usual response to danger is to scuttle away to find a hiding place.|$|E
5|$|Printed pattern {{books were}} not easily obtainable, and a sampler or {{embroidered}} record of stitches <b>and</b> <b>patterns</b> {{was the most}} common form of reference. 16th-century English samplers were stitched on a narrow band of fabric and totally covered with stitches. These band samplers were highly valued, often being mentioned in wills and passed down through the generations. These samplers were stitched using a variety of needlework styles, threads, and ornament.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{could be}} exploited industrially and commercially, and research {{that could lead}} to such applications is under way. A direct parallel would be to create active or adaptive military camouflage fabrics that vary their colours <b>and</b> <b>patterns</b> to match their environments, just as chameleons and cephalopods do. The ability to vary reflectivity to different wavelengths of light could also lead to efficient optical switches that could function like transistors, enabling engineers to make fast optical computers and routers.|$|E

5|$|The skin of {{crocodilians}} {{is thick}} and cornified, and is clad in non-overlapping scales known as scutes, arranged in regular rows <b>and</b> <b>patterns.</b> These scales are continually being produced by cell {{division in the}} underlying layer of the epidermis, the stratum germinativum, and the surface of individual scutes sloughs off periodically. The outer surface of the scutes consists of the relatively rigid beta-keratin while the hinge region between the scutes contains only the more pliable alpha-keratin.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, a novel image {{compression}} method based on {{generation of the}} so-called classified energy <b>and</b> <b>pattern</b> blocks (CEPB) is introduced and evaluation results are presented. The CEPB is constructed using the training images and then located at both the transmitter and receiver sides of the communication system. Then the energy <b>and</b> <b>pattern</b> blocks of input images to be reconstructed {{are determined by the}} same way {{in the construction of the}} CEPB. This process is also associated with a matching procedure to determine the index numbers of the classified energy <b>and</b> <b>pattern</b> blocks in the CEPB which best represents (matches) the energy <b>and</b> <b>pattern</b> blocks of the input images. Encoding parameters are block scaling coefficient and index numbers of energy <b>and</b> <b>pattern</b> blocks determined for each block of the input images. These parameters are sent from the transmitter part to the receiver part and the classified energy <b>and</b> <b>pattern</b> blocks associated with the index numbers are pulled from the CEPB. Then the input image is reconstructed block by block in the receiver part using a mathematical model that is proposed. Evaluation results show that the method provides considerable {{image compression}} ratios and image quality even at low bit rates.|$|R

5|$|A kilim is an Islamic flatwoven carpet (without a pile), {{whether for}} {{household}} use or a prayer mat. The pattern {{is made by}} winding the weft threads back over the warp threads when a colour boundary is reached. This technique leaves a gap or vertical slit, so kilims are sometimes called slit-woven textiles. Kilims are often decorated with geometric patterns with 2- or 4-fold mirror or rotational symmetries. Because weaving uses vertical and horizontal threads, curves are difficult to generate, <b>and</b> <b>patterns</b> are accordingly formed mainly with straight edges. Kilim patterns are often characteristic of specific regions. Kilim motifs are often symbolic as well as decorative. For example, the wolf's mouth or wolf's foot motif (Turkish: Kurt Aǧzi, Kurt İzi) expresses the tribal weavers' desires for protection of their families' flocks from wolves.|$|E
5|$|Architectural designs {{resembling}} plants {{appear in}} the capitals of Ancient Egyptian columns, which were carved to resemble either the Egyptian white lotus or the papyrus. Ancient Greek columns of the Corinthian order are decorated with acanthus leaves. Islamic art, too, makes frequent use of plant motifs <b>and</b> <b>patterns,</b> including on column capitals. These designs became increasingly elaborate and stylised, appearing as complex arabesque and geometric motifs in objects such as the Ardabil Carpet and ten-pointed Persian ceramic star tiles, influencing the decorative arts in the Western world in such forms as the Rococo and later the Arts and Crafts movement.|$|E
