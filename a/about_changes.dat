5|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Reformation brought <b>about</b> <b>changes</b> in the {{governance}} of the cathedrals as discussed below. Some existent buildings became cathedrals at this time. Several of the buildings were structurally damaged or left incomplete because of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, 1537–40. Many of the large abbey churches, particularly those outside the towns, were robbed, burnt out and abandoned. The late 16th and early 17th centuries saw repairs to the fabric of many cathedrals and some new building and stained glass {{as well as many}} new fittings.|$|E
5|$|Ecology surged {{in popular}} and {{scientific}} interest during the 1960–1970s environmental movement. There are strong historical and scientific ties between ecology, environmental management, and protection. The historical emphasis and poetic naturalistic writings advocating {{the protection of}} wild places by notable ecologists {{in the history of}} conservation biology, such as Aldo Leopold and Arthur Tansley, have been seen as far removed from urban centres where, it is claimed, the concentration of pollution and environmental degradation is located. Palamar (2008) notes an overshadowing by mainstream environmentalism of pioneering women in the early 1900s who fought for urban health ecology (then called euthenics) and brought <b>about</b> <b>changes</b> in environmental legislation. Women such as Ellen Swallow Richards and Julia Lathrop, among others, were precursors to the more popularized environmental movements after the 1950s.|$|E

The prime minister may authorise any deputy to represent the PM and otherwise take over any particular task assigned to the PM. The quorum for government sessions is a majority of government members. Most decisions are reached by a simple majority vote; a two-thirds majority vote is required for decisions <b>about</b> <b>changes</b> to the Croatian Constitution, uniting with other states or transferring any part of Croatian sovereignty to supranational organisations, changes to Croatian borders, dissolution of the parliament, or calling a referendum.|$|E
5|$|His third studio album, titled Mockingbird (2005), was {{released}} on December 26, 2005. The album touches on subjects such as politics, social justice, and war. Webb has stated that he tackled these subjects to stimulate discussion and engage people to bring <b>about</b> <b>changes</b> in {{what he sees as}} some of the greatest problems the world is facing today. In order to broaden this discussion to people less inclined to purchase his album, beginning September 1, 2006, Webb offered Mockingbird for free on the website Free Derek Webb (no longer exists), where it was available for download until December 8, 2006. Over 80,000 free copies of the album were downloaded during this time.|$|E
5|$|After the Russian {{victory against}} Sweden in 1743, the Swedes {{established}} {{a commission to}} identify weaknesses in the eastern defenses. In 1747, the commission concluded that the fortifications in southeastern Finland needed to be improved and expanded, and that Sweden needed to build a strong coastal navy. Augustin Ehrensvärd (1710–72), an artillery officer, was {{the driving force behind}} these changes. The committee based many of its conclusions and decisions on his ideas. In 1756, Sweden established the archipelago fleet with the official name arméns flotta ("fleet of the army") under the command of the army department, Krigskollegium, with Ehrensvärd as supreme commander. For two decades, the struggle for power between the Hats and the Caps, the dominant political factions at the time, and rivalries between army and navy brought <b>about</b> <b>changes</b> to the archipelago fleet. The parliamentary victory of the Hats in the Riksdag in 1769–70 and the coup d'ètat by King Gustav III in 1772 secured the archipelago fleet's status as an independent branch of the army. Starting in 1770, the archipelago fleet merged with the Finnish Squadron (Finska eskadern) based at Sveaborg. In 1777, it incorporated the Swedish Squadron (Svenska eskadern), the galley fleet based at Stockholm. The Swedish armed forces invested considerable resources in the new army branch and made it a professional, independent organization. The archipelago fleet attracted members of the social and cultural elite who enjoyed the protection and patronage of King Gustav III, who had established himself as an absolute monarch in the 1772 coup.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a formal logic for reasoning <b>about</b> <b>change</b> {{has proven to be}} surprisingly difficult. Furthermore, the logics that have been developed have found surprisingly little application in those fields, such as Qualitative Reasoning, that are concerned with building programs that emulate human common-sense reasoning <b>about</b> <b>change.</b> In this paper, we argue that a basic tenet of qualitative reasoning practice [...] -the separation of modeling and simulation [...] -obviates many of the difficulties faced by previous attempts to formalize reasoning <b>about</b> <b>change.</b> Our analysis helps explain why the QR community has been nonplussed by some of the problems studied in the nonmonotonic reasoning community. Further, the formalism we present provides both the beginnings of a formal foundation for qualitative reasoning, and a framework in which to study a number of open problems in qualitative reasoning.

In the judicial sphere, under Mongol influence capital punishment, which during the times of Kievan Rus' had only been applied to slaves, became widespread, and the use of torture became a regular part of criminal procedure. Specific punishments introduced in Moscow included beheading for alleged traitors and branding of thieves (with execution for a third arrest).|$|E

25|$|However, the {{reorganisation}} {{of states}} in India on linguistic basis removed Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam speaking regions from the Madras Presidency {{leaving behind a}} predominantly Tamil Madras State. Giving in to realities, Annadurai and his DMK changed the call of independent Dravida Nadu for Dravidians to independent Tamil Nadu for Tamils. Annadurai felt that remaining in the Indian Union meant accepting linguistic domination and economic backwardness. Nevertheless, the Sino-Indian war brought <b>about</b> <b>changes</b> in the Indian constitution. The Sixteenth Amendment (most popularly known as the Anti-Secessionist Amendment) banned any party with sectarian principles from participating in elections. When this amendment was presented in the Parliament of India, Annadurai was one of its members. He vehemently debated against the amendment, but eventually could not stop it from being passed. Faced with the new constitutional changes, Annadurai and his DMK left the call for an independent Tamil homeland on the back burner.|$|E
25|$|Fragmented {{habitats}} due to urbanization, {{as well as}} disturbances to {{the environment}} from humans and introduced species, are harmful to most butterflies. Additionally, threats occur to local vegetation such as recreation, trampling of vegetation, fire regimes, and introduction of plant pathogens, which bring <b>about</b> <b>changes</b> to local plant community. Distribution of butterflies depends heavily on the site characteristics and the density of that species' host plants. Changing plant composition changes the distribution of most butterflies' range, isolating them to pockets where the vegetation is ideal. Because {{of the variety of}} host plants used by Australian painted ladies, it has not been significantly affected by these changes. It has been found to use some species of carduine thistles, which are invasive to Australia, as host plants in New South Wales. Australian painted ladies use the plants as hosts during their larval stage, and as food sources. However, they inflict little damage to the plant.|$|E
25|$|Early in the 15th {{century the}} ideas of Humanism in Croatia brought <b>about</b> <b>changes</b> {{to the world of}} music. Interest in music began to spread outside of monastic and church walls with growing {{influence}} of new spiritual tendencies from Central European and particularly Italian cities. Humanists and philosophers promulgated new musical theories and aesthetic ideas: Federik Grisogono, Pavao Skalić, Frane Petrić. The writing down of folk and popular music began in mid-sixteenth century: in the poem Fishing and Fishermen’s Talk from 1558, Petar Hektorović ingrained Neoplatonic ideals in popular music; and transcripts of Croatian musical folklore were printed in Venetian anthologies (Giulio Cesare Barbetta 1569, Marco Facoli 1588). Julije Skjavetić from Šibenik published his madrigals (Li madrigali a quattro, et a cinque voci 1562), while his Motetti a cinque et a sei voci, (1564) are characterised by a lavish polyphonic structure {{under the influence of the}} Dutch school. Music and dance were a component part of theatrical expression (Mavro Vetranović, Nikola Nalješković, Marin Držić, Marin Benetović), while the function of music and sound effects was under the influence of Italian pastorals.|$|E

He added that no government had ever put forward [...] "a more retrograde and dangerous" [...] set of proposals for dealing with access to information laws. Baird described Reid's criticisms as [...] "excessive", stating that most of the commissioner's specific concerns were minor in nature. Representatives of Canada's business community also expressed concern <b>about</b> <b>changes</b> to disclosure laws, arguing that their commercial secrets could be exposed to competitors.|$|E

[...] The muted response in the Western media contrasted with the reaction from the East: East German Politburo member Günter Schabowski considered the speech to be [...] "absurd", and the Soviet press agency TASS accused Reagan of giving an [...] "openly provocative, war-mongering speech." [...] Ironically, it was Schabowski who {{two and a half years}} later, on the 9th November 1989, became the person to open the wall by providing a slightly mistaken answer on a press conference <b>about</b> <b>changes</b> in travel regulations for East German citizens.|$|E
500|$|Season two {{directors}} Larry Houston and Davis Doi {{changed the}} show to resemble the classic franchise. Writer Glenn Leopold revived Hadji's latent psionic powers—including spoon-bending and rope tricks—as he felt the first season's realism was [...] "not that interesting to watch". All characters lost a year in age; Jonny became 13. Writer Lance Falk returned Race to governmental guard duty, sealed by an episodic visit with classic Quest spymaster Phil Corven. Race lost his western accent (with Falk even comparing Race's western accent to Batman having a French accent), and Dr. Quest regained his classic red hair and exhibited rudimentary combat skills. Falk regarded Jessie as the [...] "missing piece needed to complete the Quest family", and Leopold added slight romantic overtones to episodes. Some fans complained <b>about</b> <b>changes</b> to Jessie, criticized as a damsel in distress with stereotypically female pink clothes. Jonny saved Jessie from danger several times. Falk defended his portrayal as giving her realistic, human fears, such as claustrophobia. Censors asked the second season team to replace firearms with dart guns, notably in the episode [...] "General Winter".|$|E
