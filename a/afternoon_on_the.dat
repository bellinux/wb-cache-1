5|$|Late in the <b>afternoon</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 11th, wily Saltykov {{realized}} that Frederick was not advancing on him from Frankfurt, and changed his plans. He inverted his flanks: {{instead of having}} the left wing at the shtetl and the right at Mühlberge, he reversed his flank with the right at the shtetl. Then the Russians set fire to Kunersdorf. Within hours, {{the only thing left}} was the stone church and some walls. While Frederick developed his plan to outflank Saltykov by maneuvering behind him, Saltykov outfoxed him.|$|E
5|$|After the Crimson Tide defense {{held the}} Aggies to a punt, McCarron threw his second {{touchdown}} pass of the <b>afternoon</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> drive that ensued {{early in the}} second quarter on a 44-yard flea flicker pass to DeAndrew White that tied the game 14–14. On the next drive, Cyrus Jones intercepted a Manziel pass in the end zone for a touchback and an Alabama possession. McCarron then threw his third touchdown pass on the game from 51yards to Kenny Bell and gave the Crimson Tide their first lead of the game, 21–14.

5|$|High water {{remained}} in Salcha through the 31st, though {{the crest of}} the flooding had passed. Water continued to cover roads in and around Salcha, and water-borne debris accumulated under several local bridges, causing impromptu dams. By August 1, the Salcha River had begun to recede to a noticeable extent. Though some roads remained underwater and falling trees knocked out power to areas of the town, residents began to pump out basements and begin recovery efforts. By early <b>afternoon</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first, the Old Richardson Highway had been cleared of water and the National Weather Service canceled its flood warning for the Salcha area.|$|E

5|$|Loeb, driving an all new Citroën C4 WRC car {{which had}} been in {{development}} throughout 2006, {{took control of the}} race from the outset, winning the two stages on the first day and four more stages over the following three days. His teammate Sordo kept the pressure on, winning three stages, but on Stage 6, Loeb extended his lead from 6.6 seconds to nearly 24 seconds, and from thereon became unattainable. Each stage on the first two Legs were won by either Loeb or Sordo, and it wasn't until Saturday <b>afternoon</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second run of the day's stages, that other drivers could effectively challenge them. The last two days of the race consisted of a duel between Mikko Hirvonen, who drove a factory 2006 model Ford Focus RS WRC, and Chris Atkinson in a factory Subaru Impreza WRC 2006. After Hirvonen completed Stage 2 in fourth place, Atkinson took the position on Stage 3 and held onto it throughout Friday and into Saturday morning's stages. On Stage 12 on Saturday afternoon, Hirvonen retook fourth, Atkinson regained it on Stage 13 but then lost it to Hirvonen again following Stage 14. Atkinson won the final stage on Sunday morning, and finished the race back in fourth position.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of the match, Larwood was unfit and Allen played. England batted first, and Allen scored three runs before being {{dismissed}} on the first <b>afternoon.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> second morning, an article in the Daily Express by Trevor Wignall, a popular journalist who wrote sensational sports stories, suggested that the crowd's enjoyment of the day was marred by Allen's inclusion on the grounds of his Australian birth. Wignall claimed that the public felt Allen should have been omitted, and that the selectors were rumoured to be ignorant of his birthplace. That day, Allen opened the bowling for England; after a slow start, the Australian openers added 162 runs before the first wicket fell. Like the other bowlers, Allen then rapidly conceded runs to Donald Bradman, who scored 254 runs. Australia scored 729 for six declared in reply to England's 425, and Allen returned bowling figures of none for 115 from 34 overs. England lost early wickets in their second innings, and when Allen came in to bat, the score was 147 for five wickets, still 167 behind the Australians. He scored 57 and shared a partnership of 125 with his captain, Percy Chapman, to take England into the lead but Australia won the match by seven wickets. In contrast to the reaction to his bowling, Allen's innings was praised in the press. This was his only Test of the series.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the failure}} and scathing {{critical}} reception of Merrily We Roll Along in 1981 (it closed after 16 performances), Sondheim announced {{his intention to}} quit musical theatre. Lapine persuaded {{him to return to}} the theatrical world after the two were inspired by A Sunday <b>Afternoon</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Island of La Grande Jatte. They spent several days at the Art Institute of Chicago studying the painting. Lapine noted that one major figure was missing from the canvas: the artist himself. This observation provided the springboard for Sunday and the production evolved into a meditation on art, emotional connection and community.|$|E
25|$|On 9 September OKL {{appeared}} to be backing two strategies. Its round-the-clock bombing of London was an immediate attempt to force the British government to capitulate, {{but it was also}} striking at Britain's vital sea communications to achieve a victory through siege. Although the weather was poor, heavy raids took place that <b>afternoon</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> London suburbs and the airfield at Farnborough. The day's fighting cost Kesselring and Luftflotte 2 (Air Fleet 2) 24 aircraft, including 13 Bf 109s. Fighter Command lost 17 fighters and six pilots. Over the next few days weather was poor and the next main effort would not be made until 15 September 1940.|$|E

25|$|The First Battle of Gaza {{was fought}} on 26 March 1917, {{during the first}} attempt by the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) to invade the south of Palestine in the Ottoman Empire during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War. Fighting took place {{in and around the}} town of Gaza on the Mediterranean coast when {{infantry}} and mounted infantry from the Desert Column, a component of the Eastern Force, attacked the town. Late in the <b>afternoon,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> verge of capturing Gaza, the Desert Column was withdrawn due to concerns about the approaching darkness and large Ottoman reinforcements.

25|$|One Christmas was so {{much like}} another, in those years, around the sea-town corner now, and out of all sound except the distant {{speaking}} of the voices I sometimes hear a moment before sleep, that I can never remember whether it snowed for six days and six nights when I was twelve or whether it snowed for twelve days and twelve nights when I was six; or whether the ice broke and the skating grocer vanished like a snowman through a white trap-door on that same Christmas Day that the mince-pies finished Uncle Arnold and we tobogganed down the seaward hill, all the <b>afternoon,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> best tea-tray, and Mrs. Griffiths complained, and we threw a snowball at her niece, and my hands burned so, with {{the heat and the}} cold, when I held them in front of the fire, that I cried for twenty minutes and then had some jelly.|$|E
25|$|Wisden {{identified}} the third Test as featuring the best cricket {{of the three}} matches, partially due to the better weather. For the third time, England won the toss and batted, and were led by a century from Fry and a half-century from the captain, R. E. Foster. Although England made a respectable total, their batting was criticised for being inconsistent, and the South African bowling praised as being difficult. Due to rain breaks, England batted {{until the middle of}} the <b>afternoon</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second day to reach their 295. When South Africa came in to bat, the conditions were difficult as the pitch was drying, but partially due to some inaccurate bowling from Blythe, the batsmen were able to score runs. Tip Snooke top-scored with 63 runs, while Nourse, Jimmy Sinclair and William Shalders all scored twenty or more. Blythe bowled far better on the final morning to dismiss South Africa for 178, leaving England a 117-run lead.|$|E
