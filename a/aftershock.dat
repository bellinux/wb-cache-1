5|$|Seismologists {{reported}} that the earthquakes {{were part of a}} prolonged <b>aftershock</b> sequence associated with the major magnitude 7.1 earthquake of September 2010, which includes the February 2011 event. They were succeeded by multiple lighter aftershocks; the strongest, a moderate magnitude 5.1 ML struck a minute after the event. Another tremor 5.0 ML struck the region two days later. Despite significant energy release, the earthquakes were believed to have increased the risk of an additional <b>aftershock</b> of similar magnitude; calculations from GNS Science indicated a 23 percent probability of a magnitude 6.0–6.9 ML earthquake occurring in the Canterbury <b>aftershock</b> zone within the 12 months following the event. Weeks later, a magnitude 5.4 ML tremor jolted Christchurch overnight on 22 June, causing additional damage and prompting evacuations.|$|E
5|$|The day of {{the main}} event two {{aftershocks}} occurred (5.6 at 14:51 and 5.4 at 22:07) but the initial shock was V (Moderate) on the Mercalli intensity scale and the second event was felt only. Ten days following the mainshock on July 31, a stronger <b>aftershock</b> occurred with a local magnitude of 5.8 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VI (Strong). That <b>aftershock</b> was felt in California and western Nevada, broke windows and knocked items of shelves in Bishop, and light fixtures were damaged at the National Weather Service office.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} seven {{people from other}} regions near the epicentre, {{including}} southern Ibaraki, Tochigi and Kanagawa prefectures, suffered minor injuries. Another person was injured during the magnitude 6.0 (Mw) <b>aftershock</b> of 12 April. In a report from July 2011, the Fire and Disaster Management Agency confirmed a death toll of four from the earthquake.|$|E
30|$|Under {{minor and}} {{moderate}} damage states, near-fault <b>aftershocks</b> were prominent over far-fault <b>aftershocks</b> for severe MS-severe AS sequence. Under extensive and collapse damages states far-fault <b>aftershocks</b> appeared more significant compared to near-fault <b>aftershocks</b> for severe MS-severe AS sequence. However, near-fault <b>aftershocks</b> were prominent at all damage states under severe MS-moderate AS.|$|R

5|$|The {{area where}} Armenia lies is of {{interest}} to seismologists and geologists because of the relatively early stage of continental collision occurring there and because the earthquake's strong <b>aftershock</b> sequence and significant surface faulting presented scientists with an environment to study reverse faulting. Twelve days after the mainshock a French-Soviet team installed a temporary seismic network in the epicentral area to record <b>aftershock</b> activity (a separate expedition from the United States also visited the site). The initial portion of work included nearly a full week setting up the seismometers and optimizing their operation and, with that complete, two full weeks of continuous operation was then completed with twenty six seismometers covering an area over 1500 square kilometers. The final stage concluded with seven weeks (through the end of February 1989) of continued monitoring with a reduced capacity of twenty units.|$|E
5|$|The town of Tehachapi {{suffered}} the greatest damage {{and loss of}} life from the earthquake, though other locations in Kern County experienced significant damage as well, but its effects were widely felt throughout central and southern California. The July mainshock had a significant <b>aftershock</b> sequence that persisted into July and August with many magnitude 5+ events with intensities of V (Moderate) to VII (Very strong). Six of these aftershocks occurred {{on the day of}} the mainshock, but the strongest <b>aftershock</b> came on August 22 as a M5.8 event that had a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe) and resulted in the deaths of two people and caused an additional $10 million in property damage.|$|E

5|$|By 6May, a {{total of}} five light {{aftershocks}} had occurred near the earthquake's epicenter. Of the five, the first registered a magnitude of 3.7(ML) and struck about 15 minutes after the main shock, and was succeeded by a magnitude 3.9(ML) tremor at 10:09 local time. Two similar quakes of minor intensity struck the region the next day; however, the strongest and final <b>aftershock</b> registered a magnitude of 4.1(ML) and occurred at 04:00 in the morning.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{aftershocks}} {{occurred after}} the main tremor. The first four (of magnitude 2.8, 2.2, 4.2 and 3.4) occurred within 12hours {{of the main}} shock. A 2.5-magnitude shock occurred just after midnight on August 25, followed at 05:07 UTC by the strongest, a magnitude 4.5 <b>aftershock</b> that woke many residents in Northern Virginia and Washington, D.C., and was felt {{as far away as}} New England, Georgia, and Illinois.|$|E

30|$|We have {{investigated}} the spatial relation between similar <b>aftershocks</b> and the asperity of the 2000 Western Tottori earthquake from analysis of dense temporary seismic observation data. Many similar <b>aftershocks</b> are distributed {{in the northern part}} of the source fault, but few in the southern part. We find no similar <b>aftershocks</b> in the asperity, i.e., the asperity and the similar <b>aftershocks</b> show a spatially complementary distribution. The cumulative slip of the similar <b>aftershocks,</b> estimated from empirical scaling relations, is large in the shallow depth in the northern part. This is coincident with the geodetic observation that provided large postseismic crustal deformation around the northern area of the source fault. In other words, the similar <b>aftershocks</b> are phenomena that relate to afterslip. We also estimate the slip velocity from both the slip and the recurrence interval of the similar <b>aftershocks.</b> However, the slip velocity shows no distinct distribution.|$|R
5|$|Sixty villages (including {{the large}} {{settlement}} of Dilman, which was relocated and rebuilt as Salmas) were {{destroyed in the}} Salmas Plain and in the surrounding mountainous regions. A destructive <b>aftershock</b> sequence affected many villages, and in some cases, damage was inflicted on some that had escaped devastation during the mainshock. An inspection of the region was undertaken, but not until decades later, at which time substantial surface faulting and other ground effects were documented.|$|E
5|$|Two shocks on July 25 that {{occurred}} {{within an hour}} of each other were felt throughout central California and caused pipeline damage south of Bakersfield and other minor building damage in several locations. Pre-existing ground disturbances were enhanced in Tejon Canyon, and landslides occurred at Caliente Creek Canyon, Oiler Canyon Grade, and on State Route 178 between Kernville and Bakersfield. A number of fires were initiated by the July 29 <b>aftershock</b> (intensity VII (Very strong)) and other severe damage was caused by it, especially to buildings that had already been damaged (including one in Bakersfield). The strongest <b>aftershock</b> in the sequence came on August 22 as a magnitude 5.8 event with a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe). Damage was especially heavy to brick buildings in Bakersfield, and although only a few buildings collapsed outright, 90 of 264 buildings that the shock damaged needed to be brought down completely. Total damage from this event alone was estimated to be $10 million, with several injuries, and two additional deaths.|$|E
5|$|In comparison, the South Island has {{experienced}} fewer large earthquakes. The magnitude 7.1 Mw event of 4 September 2010 produced {{by far the}} strongest ground motions ever recorded in the Canterbury region, triggering {{a large number of}} aftershocks. Although similar <b>aftershock</b> sequences have historically occurred around the world, such occurrences were extremely unusual in the region, which had shown low levels of seismic activity for thousands of years. The event has led to the discovery of previously dormant geological faults across central-eastern South Island, in particular beneath regional plains and the adjacent seabed.|$|E
40|$|A {{theory of}} the time {{dependence}} of earthquake foreshocks and <b>aftershocks</b> is presented. The theory involves the response to sudden forcing of a dynamics of self-driven acceleration to failure. The empirically observed Omori law, which says {{that the rate of}} <b>aftershocks</b> as a function of time falls as a power law in time, is derived theoretically. The exponent of the falloff in time is shown to generically give a value close to one, for rapidly accelerating dynamics. To see if the theory is consistent with other features of real data, foreshocks and <b>aftershocks</b> of small magnitude mainshocks are analyzed in a catalogue of real earthquakes. Results show that the spatial and temporal distribution of <b>aftershocks</b> is separable into a dependence on space and a dependence on time, that the spatial distribution of <b>aftershocks</b> is consistent with the hypothesis that stress changes from the mainshock cause <b>aftershocks,</b> and that the number of foreshocks approaches the number of <b>aftershocks</b> as the magnitude of the mainshock becomes smaller...|$|R

30|$|<b>Aftershocks</b> {{following}} a large earthquake show striking {{features of a}} temporal decay rate, Omori’s law (Omori, 1894), and spatial distribution. The spatial distribution of <b>aftershocks</b> usually provides information related to the source fault of the preceding large earthquake. The spatial extent of <b>aftershocks</b> is used to estimate the source fault location. Furthermore, the precise location of <b>aftershocks</b> can suggest a rupture pattern on the source fault. For example, {{in the case of}} the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku earthquake, the <b>aftershocks</b> on the plate interface were distributed not in the coseismic slip area but in the surrounding areas (e.g. Asano et al., 2011).|$|R
5|$|The 6.9 {{earthquake}} of 11 March 2010 occurred {{two weeks}} after the 27 February event. Chilean seismologists, including Sergio Barrientos from the University of Chile Seismological Service, had suggested that the absence of an <b>aftershock</b> greater than magnitude 6 following the February 27 quake indicated that there remained energy with the potential to be released. Two foreshocks of the 11 March event occurred on 5 March: one reached magnitude 5.7, and the other magnitude 5.2; both were felt between the Valparaíso and Maule regions.|$|E
5|$|The CGS {{warned that}} {{aftershocks}} were {{expected in the}} days following the earthquake and they could possibly continue for months. They recommended that buildings be evacuated {{in the event of an}} <b>aftershock.</b> The mining regulator's chief inspector of mines David Msiza asked mining companies in affected areas, including Klerksdorp, Carletonville and Rustenburg, to undertake underground inspections to ensure no miners were trapped and the working conditions were safe for miners. AngloGold Ashanti denied responsibility for the earthquake, saying it occurred away from its mining infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|The NZX 50 Index fell by 0.4 {{percent to}} its lowest level since 20 April; within the index, a total of 24 stocks fell, while six rose and 20 {{remained}} unchanged. In addition, the New Zealand dollar declined {{in the wake of}} the disaster, reportedly dropping by nearly 0.01 US dollar, or about 1.3 percent. Following a dramatic decline in event numbers, Vbase, a council-owned venue management company, announced the disemployment of 151 of its full-time staff workers. Nationwide, building consents tumbled considerably, dropping by 4.5 percent {{in the wake of the}} <b>aftershock.</b> The disaster's impact extended beyond national grounds; in light of its occurrence, Insurance Australia Group reported an estimated net claim loss of A$65 million (US$61.5 million).|$|E

30|$|We {{detected}} similar <b>aftershocks</b> of the 2000 Western Tottori {{earthquake and}} we have examined their spatial distribution on the source fault. Many similar <b>aftershocks</b> are distributed {{in the northern part}} of the source fault, but few in the southern part. Specifically, similar <b>aftershocks</b> on the source fault are located outside of the asperity. The cumulative slip estimated from the similar <b>aftershocks</b> is 0.4 – 2.4 cm. The largest one is found at the edge of the major asperity. We observe that shallower events show a larger cumulative slip than deeper events. Large cumulative slip in the shallow depth in the northern part is coincident with the geodetic observation of afterslip. These facts suggest that similar <b>aftershocks</b> can provide information related to afterslip. However, the slip velocity estimated from both the slip and the recurrence interval of the similar <b>aftershocks</b> shows no distinct distribution.|$|R
5|$|There was {{extensive}} {{damage to buildings}} in Orkney and the surrounding areas, partly due to inadequate building construction vulnerable to earthquake damage. The Khuma township near Stilfontein {{was one of the}} worst affected areas, with more than 600 homes damaged by the earthquake. An <b>aftershock</b> occurred in Khuma in the afternoon of 5August while residents were assessing the damage to their homes. Three clinics in the North West province were damaged, leading to the closure of two of them. Two schools were damaged and some pupils were unable to attend classes as the classrooms were too badly damaged.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{relatively}} strong ground motions, {{damage to}} the area was very limited; structures around the epicenter were a mix of fairly vulnerable and resistant to earthquake shaking. Buildings swayed with the tremor in Mexico City, causing panic among many citizens and prompting some to evacuate. Several schools in Guerrero were evacuated as a safety precaution. The earthquake and its <b>aftershock</b> sequence contributed to intermittent power outages in Acapulco; more than 40,000 residences in some 40 districts remained without power by the next day. There were no reports of major losses or fatalities {{in the wake of}} the tremor, though two police stations located in Acapulco and Marquelia suffered light damage. Elsewhere, some fallen roof tiles and small landslides occurred east of the epicenter in Cuautepec.|$|E
5|$|On 10 April 2005 an <b>aftershock</b> {{measuring}} 6.7 on the Richter scale {{struck the}} west coast of Sumatra two weeks after a larger earthquake struck Nias. This caused crackage to the columns supporting the mosque's roof. Three years later, the Ganting Grand Mosque was one of 608 places of worship severely damaged when another large earthquake struck the area on 30 September 2009. The earthquake collapsed part of the mosque's façade and caused severe structural damage to the interior columns; as a result, the community feared that the mosque would collapse. Before renovations were completed in 2010, prayers had to be held in the yard. In 2011 the Ganting Grand Mosque was listed as one of Indonesia's 100 most beautiful mosques in a book compiled by Andalan Media. The only other mosque from West Sumatra included was Raya Bayur Mosque, Agam Regency.|$|E
