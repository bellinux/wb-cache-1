40|$|<b>ANILERIDINE</b> <b>dihydrochloride</b> {{has been}} shown to be a useful {{analgesic}} agent for pre-operative medication (Dechene and Hebert, 1959), post-operative medication (Riffin et aL, 1958; Dechene and Hebert, 1959) and for the supplementation of anaesthesia (Chang, Safar and Lasagna, 1958; Swerdlow, Brown and Tetlow, 1960). The present paper reports a small study of the effects of anileridine on respiration in anaesthetized sub-jects. The results are compared with those of an investigation of the respiratory effects of pethi-dine, carried out earlier under identical conditions (Swerdlow, 1957). The standard of equipotency adopted was that of Keats, Kurosa and Telford (1957), Le. 40 mg anileridine is equivalent t...|$|E
40|$|It has {{generally}} been accepted that for analgesic activity a methyl group is the optimal radical on the nitrogen atom present in all potent analgesics (Braenden et al., 1955; Burger, 1951; and Schaumann, 1940). Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that phenethyl increases analgesic activity when substituted for methyl on the nitrogen of certain analgesic compounds (Clark et at., 1953; Per-rifle and Eddy, 1956). Work in our laboratories has also indicated that further substitution, now on the aromatic ring of the phenethyl radical, produces a greater increase in potency and other desirable characteristics. An extensive program {{based on these findings}} has led to the synthesis of ethyl- 1 -(4 -amino-phenethyl) - 4 -phenylisonipecotate (Weijlard et al., 1956). This compound, given the generic name anileridine, {{is a member of the}} piper-idine class of analgesic agents. It differs chemically from meperidine in that the N-methyl group of meperidine is replaced by N-(p-aminophenethyl). Since this change introduces a second basic group into the molecule, <b>anileridine</b> forms a <b>dihydrochloride.</b> The structural formula of the compound in comparison with meperidine is shown below...|$|R
