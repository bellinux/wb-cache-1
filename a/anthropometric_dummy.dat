40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) {{is a common}} injury and is {{a leading cause of}} {{morbidity}} and mortality throughout the world. Research has been undertaken in order to better understand the characteristics of the injury event and measure the risk of injury to develop more effective environmental, technological, and clinical management strategies. This research used methods that have limited applications to predicting human responses. This limits the current understanding of the mechanisms of TBI in humans. As a result, the purpose of this research was to examine the characteristics of impact and dynamic response that leads to a high risk of incurring a TBI in a human population. Twenty TBI events collected from hospital reports and eyewitness accounts were reconstructed in the laboratory using a combination of computational mechanics models and Hybrid III <b>anthropometric</b> <b>dummy</b> systems. All cases were falls, with an average impact velocity of approximately 4. 0 m/s onto hard impact surfaces. The results of the methodology were consistent with current TBI research, describing TBI to occur in the range of 335 to 445 g linear accelerations and 23. 7 to 51. 2 krad/s 2 53 angular accelerations. More significantly, this research demonstrated that lower responses in the antero-posterior direction can cause TBI, with lateral impact responses requiring larger magnitudes for the same types of brain lesions. This suggests an increased likelihood of incurring TBI for impacts to the front or back of the head, a result that has implications affecting current understanding of themechanisms of TBI and associated threshold parameters...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Concussions {{typically}} resolve {{within a}} few days however in a few cases the symptoms last for a month or longer and are termed persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS) with more serious brain trauma resulting in bleeds, such as subdural hematoma (SDH). Dynamic response and brain tissue deformation characteristics may provide a means of distinguishing between these three types of injuries. Methods: Reconstruction cases were recruited from sports medicine clinics and hospitals along with medical reports, video footage, and medical imaging. All subjects received a direct blow to the head resulting in head trauma symptoms, those that resolved in 9 days were termed concussions, those with symptoms longer than 18 months were PPCS and those presenting with subdural hematoma (SDH). An <b>anthropometric</b> <b>dummy</b> headform was dropped onto various impact surfaces using a monorail drop rig. Headform dynamic response data was collected and used as input into the University College Dublin Brain Trauma Model to obtain maximum principal strain and von Mises stress. Results: Both linear and rotational acceleration of the head increased in magnitude with an increase in injury severity (from concussion, to PPCS, and SDH). The PPCS group had peak resultant rotational accelerations similar to SDH and significantly higher than concussions. There were no significant differences for peak resultant linear accelerations between the two concussion groups however they were both significantly lower than the SDH group. Brain tissue deformation measures however, did not follow the same trend as dynamic response and resulted with SDH having the lowest values of stress and strain. PPCS had significantly higher values of strain than the SDH group, where both the concussion and PPCS groups had significantly higher stress values than the SDH group. Conclusion: This study supports the notion that there is a positive relationship between an increase in the dynamic response and the risk for more serious brain injury. Peak resultant linear acceleration may be more related to SDH meanwhile rotational acceleration may be more relatedto severity of concussion. Despite SDH being the more severe brain injury, on average this group had the lowest values for stress and strain as compared to concussion and PPCS. Finite element analysis of the SDH injuries examined brain tissue values for the group of elements in the model than corresponded to the location of the bleed which may not be reflective of the highest values if the entire cerebrum was considered. More importantly, SDH injuries are vascular injuries and may not necessarily result in damage to the brain. In summary, this study found that the dynamic response of an impact is reflective of injury severity. Understanding the relationship between the dynamic response {{and the nature of the}} injury provides important information for developing strategies for injury prevention...|$|E

Also of interest was the perceived task difficulty of the transferors, and what influence this may have on the safety of the traveler being transferred. 	Thirty-three pairs of apparently healthy men and women worked together to perform two-person dependent transfers between a wheelchair and an airplane seat in a laboratory simulation of an aircraft interior using two sizes of <b>anthropometric</b> <b>dummies.</b> A three-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to determine the influence of spatial constraints, transferee size, and transfer direction on known kinematic and kinetic risk factors for low back injury during lifting tasks. 	Results indicate that the constraints significantly influenced lumbar motion of the front transferor, due to the need to reach around the seat. As a result, load moment arm was also significantly increased. Lumbar motion of the rear transferor was most influence by the size of the transferee. Flexion angles for both transfer positions were found to be greater than those known to result in high risk of low back disorder. Transferee size significantly increased lumbar loading of the rear transferor. Shorter transferors were found to experience increased lumbar motion during transfers performed from the rear position. Although constraint and transferee size influenced the perception of task difficulty, the acceleration experienced by the transferee remained unchanged. The variability associated with this measure indicates transferor safety is influenced by the persons performing the transfer. 	 These results indicate that transferee size, the spatial constraints imposed by the aircraft interior, and transferor height all affect the risk of low-back injury during dependent transfers on an aircraft...|$|R

The test method outlined in this regulation is only partially predictive of seat performance in dynamic and/or real world impacts. Many seats continue to demonstrate gross deformations or catastrophic failures with potentially injurious occupant kinematics under the impact conditions of the FMVSS 301 Fuel System Integrity testing [2].

40|$|Injuries to the knee-thigh-hip (KTH) {{complex in}} frontal motor vehicle crashes are of {{substantial}} concern {{because of their}} frequency and potential to result in long-term disability. Current frontal impact <b>Anthropometric</b> Test <b>Dummies</b> (ATDs) {{have been shown to}} respond differently than human cadavers under frontal knee impact loading and consequently current ATDs (and FE models thereof) may lack the biofidelity needed to predict the incidence of knee, thigh, and hip injuries in frontal crashes. These concerns demand an efficient and biofidelic tool to evaluate the occurrence of injuries as a result of KTH loading in frontal crashes. The MADYMO human finite element (FE) model was therefore adapted to simulate bone deformation, articulating joints and soft tissue behavior in the KTH complex. To validate this model, the knee-femur complex response was compared to results of post-mortem human subject (PMHS) experiments where a distributed load was applied to the knee while the femoral head rested on a fixed acetabular cup. The model was also validated against experimental whole KTH response data, in which the pelvis was fixed at the iliac wings and a distributed load was applied to the knee. These experiments showed that the acetabulum is the weakest structure in typical knee bolster loading, followed by femoral head and femoral shaft.

The Excelsior is an electrically powered wheelchair that utilizes sit-to-stand (STS) and sit-to-recline (STR) motions to aid in pressure relief. The motion of the wheelchair seating system must closely follow anatomical paths or ulcers may develop from the resulting shear forces. Displacement between the person and the wheel-chair seating surface is one measure of these shear forces. The displacement between a Hybrid II 50 th percentile <b>anthropometric</b> test <b>dummy</b> (ATD) and the seating surface of the Excelsior wheelchair was examined during STS and STR with two cushions, a Jay Active and a low-profile Roho cushion. The difference between the backrest and ATD back angles were 4. 29 °± 2. 13 °and 1. 78 °± 1. 73 ° for the Roho and Jay cushions respectively during STS and 3. 32 ° ± 4. 21 °and 10. 71 °± 6. 20 °during STR.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that it is difficult effectively to reduce cervical compression under conditions of axial loading. In this study, the effect on the magnitude of cervical compression of diverting the line of action of the axial force, through lateral bending of the head at impact, was examined. Collision simulations were conducted with a Hybrid III <b>anthropometric</b> test <b>dummy</b> (ATD) propelled head first to strike a rigid barrier. The barrier had been placed to produce angles of incidence of 70 ° and 50 ° to the ATD's line of flight. Compressive and shear forces and moments of force were obtained from a three-axis force-and-moment transducer located at the atlanto-occipital junction of the ATD. A postprocessing model was developed to predict the loading on each segment of the ATD neck. Displacement data were obtained from an infrared imaging system using two cameras placed 60 ° apart, and infrared light-emitting diodes were fixed to the metal rings of the ATD neck. The collision simulations were also filmed at 500 frames per second to provide a top-coronal-plane view of the ATD under impact. Impact analysis showed large compressive forces (> 4, 000 N) and large shear forces (600 - 1, 200 N) on the ATD segments for the 70 ° impacts. For the 50 ° impacts, however, the compression force (2, 200 N) was markedly reduced as were the shear forces (300 - 450 N). Film observation confirmed that for the 70 ° impacts, the head was constrained on the impact surface, trapping the neck between the fixed head and moving torso. For the 50 ° condition, the head was free to move in a lateral direction, the neck was not trapped, and the compression force was substantially lowered. These results suggest that neck compression can be reduced in the ATD provided there is enough lateral bending. Whether shear forces and the moments of force produced by the lateral bending can be supported in real life by the cervical column (e. g., ligaments, disks, and muscles) requires further investigation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} part of this work, an <b>Anthropometric</b> Test <b>Dummy</b> (ATD) was used to obtain torso {{acceleration}} data for Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS). These data were used to drive computational simulations of SBS, in studies of the effect of neck stiffness and head-torso impact on injury risk. Finally, physical models were used to investigate the strain induced in brain tissue during shaking. Clinical literature describes victims of Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) as young infants with life-threatening brain injuries, and poor long-term outcome. However, biomechanical studies using ATI) s to study head motion during shaking have been inconclusive about the capacity for shaking alone to cause these injuries 11, 21. This work comprises a series of investigations into these conflicting findings. Torso acceleration data for SBS, obtained using a specially constructed ATD, were found to be consistent with previous findings. The data were used to simulate shaking in computational studies of SBS, using Rigid Body Models (RBM) of the infant head and neck. Parametric studies were used to investigate the importance of neck stiffness in assessing the injury capacity of SBS, and showed that in order to exceed current injury criteria for SBS, impact was required. Head torso impact was then simulated, and although this resulted in higher injury risk than shaking alone, criteria for injuries associated with SBS were not reached. Since these investigations did not predict brain injury in cases of SBS without impact, the origins of injury criteria were reviewed. It was found that they are derived from single high energy events, which is distinct from the type of motion in SBS. In order to establish if cyclic, low-energy motion contributes to brain injury in SBS, Physical Continuum Modelling was used to study strain in brain tissue during shaking. A test rig was constructed to shake silicone gel models, and high-speed video used to capture the motion of optical markers with in the gel. Their movement was tracked using optical flow methods, and Green-Lagrangian strain derived by tensor algebra. No evidence was found to indicate a build up in strain between cycles, but published critical strains for damage to neural tissue were exceeded. Although shaking alone was not found not induce head motion in excess of brain injury criteria, tissue damage criteria were exceeded. The application of current brain injury criteria to SBS maybe therefore be inappropriate. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} a {{programme of work}} {{investigating the}} use of active human computer models {{and the effects of}} forthcoming automotive safety features on vehicle occupants; more specifically, their unbelted kinematics and sustained injuries. Since Hybrid III <b>anthropometric</b> crash test <b>dummies</b> are unable to replicate human occupant kinematics under severe braking, the thesis highlighted the need to research the most appropriate occupant computer model to simulate active safety scenarios. The first stage of the work focussed on occupant kinematics and developed unique human occupant reflex response target curves describing the head and torso relative angle change as a function of time, based on human volunteers’ low deceleration sled tests. These biomechanics curves were, subsequently, used to validate an active human model, asserting its torso response, while confirming that further development in its neck response was necessary. The sled test computer validation proved that only an active human model was suitable to model a pre-braking phase. The second stage of the work combined the occupant’s kinematics of the pre-braking phase, followed by a subsequent frontal crash into a rigid barrier inducing an airbag deployment. The results suggested that, in a 1 g frontal deceleration pre-braking phase, the kinematics of an unbelted occupant within the vehicle compartment was complex and in some cases extreme. With the parameters adopted within this unique study, it was observed that occupant motion and position relative to the airbag system varied depending on awareness level, seat friction, braking duration and posture. Additionally, it was observed that a driver holding the steering wheel with one hand could be out of the airbag deployment reach due to extreme Out-Of-Position (OOP). Results also concluded that the dynamic OOP scenario was intricate and would yield to higher occupant injuries. Future studies, into brake dive, seat geometry, seat stiffness and cabin packaging, are recommended to capture the vehicle configuration providing the highest dynamic OOP safety risk. Finally, the investigations conducted, as part of this doctoral programme, led to the provision of new knowledge in the validation of active human models, a unique demonstration of the importance using human computer models, rather than crash test dummies, as well as the potential for the evaluation of future restraint systems in dynamics unbelted OOP, considering various posture scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Motor vehicle related {{pedestrian}} {{road traffic}} collisions {{are a major}} road safety challenge, since they are {{a leading cause of}} death and serious injury worldwide, contributing to a third of the global disease burden. The auto rickshaw, which is a common form of urban transport in many developing countries, plays a major transport role, both as a vehicle for hire and for private use. The most common auto rickshaws are quite unlike ‘typical’ four-wheel motor vehicle, being typically characterised by three wheels, a non-tilting sheet-metal body or open frame construction, a canvas roof and side curtains, a small drivers’ cabin, handlebar controls and a passenger space at the rear. Given the propensity, in developing countries, for auto rickshaws to be used in mixed cityscapes, where pedestrians and vehicles share the roadway, the potential for auto rickshaw impacts with pedestrians is relatively high. Whilst auto rickshaws are used in some Western countries, their limited number and spatial separation from pedestrian walkways, as a result of city planning, has not resulted in significant accident statistics. Thus, auto rickshaws have not been subject to the vehicle impact related pedestrian crash kinematic analyses and/or injury mechanics assessment, typically associated with motor vehicle development in Western Europe, North America and Japan. This study presents a parametric analysis of auto rickshaw related pedestrian impacts by computational simulation, using a Finite Element model of an auto rickshaw and an LS-DYNA 50 th percentile male Hybrid III <b>Anthropometric</b> Test Device (<b>dummy).</b> Parametric variables include auto rickshaw impact velocity, auto rickshaw impact region (front, centre or offset) and relative pedestrian impact position (front, side and rear). The output data of each impact simulation was correlated against reported injury metrics, Head Injury Criterion (front, side and rear), Neck injury Criterion (front, side and rear), Abbreviated Injury Scale and reported risk level and adds greater understanding to the issue of auto rickshaw related pedestrian injury risk. The parametric analyses suggest that pedestrians are subject to a relatively high risk of injury during impacts with an auto rickshaw at velocities of 20 km/h or greater, which during some of the impact simulations may even risk fatalities. The present study provides valuable evidence for informing a series of recommendations and guidelines for making the auto rickshaw safer during collisions with pedestrians. Whilst it is acknowledged that the present research findings are based in the field of safety engineering and may over represent injury risk, compared to “Real World” accidents, many of the simulated interactions produced injury response values significantly greater than current threshold curves and thus, justify their inclusion in the study. To reduce the injury risk level and increase the safety of the auto rickshaw, there should be a reduction in the velocity of the auto rickshaw and, or, consideration of engineering solutions, such as retro fitting injury mitigation technologies to those auto rickshaw contact regions which are the subject of the greatest risk of producing pedestrian injury...|$|R
