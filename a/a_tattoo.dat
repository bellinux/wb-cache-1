5|$|Once a recruit was {{accepted}} he was 'marked' on the arm, presumably <b>a</b> <b>tattoo</b> or brand, to facilitate recognition if {{he attempted to}} desert. The recruit was then issued with an identification disk (which was worn around the neck) and a certificate of enlistment (probatoria). He was then assigned to a unit. A law of 375 required those with superior fitness to be assigned to the comitatenses. In the 4th century, the minimum length of service was 20 years (24 years in some limitanei units). This compares with 25 years in both legions and auxilia during the Principate.|$|E

5|$|That night, Scully {{talks to}} Mulder {{over the phone}} and informs him that Pudovkin is a con man {{and part of the}} Russian mafia. Frustrated by the conversation, Scully calls Jerse and tells him that she changed her mind. At a nearby lounge, Scully is {{concerned}} about Ed's arm, where he has burned the tattoo with a cigarette butt. Ed convinces Scully to get <b>a</b> <b>tattoo,</b> and she has one of an Ouroboros applied to her back. Scully stays at Ed's apartment. The tattoo is angry at him, saying she will be dead if he kisses her, which he does anyway.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>tattoo</b> {{on his arm}} {{identifies}} Tom Nero, and {{the rope}} still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown {{to have as much}} feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one {{of its kind in the}} first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Ed {{is fired}} via telephone. He hears the same voice as before and yells {{at the woman}} living below him, {{thinking}} it was her. Upon hearing the voice after a pair of Jehovah's Witnesses stop by, Ed goes downstairs and murders his neighbor, throwing her body in the furnace. When her voice talks to him again, Jerse realizes it is coming from his new tattoo. Scully heads to Philadelphia and watches Pudovkin enter <b>a</b> <b>tattoo</b> parlor. Inside, she sees Ed arguing with the owner, wanting the tattoo removed. Ed strikes {{up a conversation with}} Scully and invites her out to dinner, which she initially declines.|$|E

5|$|Salander, who {{is under}} state legal {{guardianship}} due to diagnosed mental incompetency, is appointed a new guardian, lawyer Nils Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen), after her previous guardian Holger Palmgren suffers a stroke. Bjurman, a sexual sadist, abuses his authority to extort sexual favors from Salander and violently rapes her, not realizing {{she has a}} hidden video camera on her bag. At their next meeting she stuns him with a taser, rapes him with a dildo, and marks him as a rapist with <b>a</b> <b>tattoo</b> {{on his chest and}} stomach. Threatening to disclose the video recording, she blackmails him into writing a glowing progress report and granting her full control of her money.|$|E

5|$|Days before Halloween, a man explodes a {{truck in}} Mars' capital city, {{spreading}} what {{is assumed to}} be a new pathogen that kills or sickens over three hundred people. In response, the Mars government issues a record bounty of 300 million woolong for the culprit's capture. Faye, who was pursuing Lee Sampson, a hacker that was apparently driving the truck, sees the terrorist and the Bebop crew decide to take on the bounty. Each follows different lines of inquiry. Ed, using <b>a</b> <b>tattoo</b> on the attacker's wrist, manages to identify him as Vincent Volaju, a former member of a military squad apparently killed in the Titan War. In reality, Vincent was the only survivor of a test involving the pathogen, having been immunized with a test vaccine: made an amnesic, he suffers from hallucinations, and his inability to tell dreams from reality eventually drove him insane.|$|E
