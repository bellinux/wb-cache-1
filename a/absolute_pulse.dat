Initially the lattice was used only to generate short x-ray pulses, for which a stable, low emittance, single bunch was requested, with the emphasis placed on increased bunch charge over shortest <b>absolute</b> <b>pulse</b> duration. More recently, the lattice has been adapted to enhance the CSR gain in the THz region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Strong enhancement of the local optical fields produces these responses at excitation intensities lower by order(s) of magnitude than for known systems.

Observations demonstrate that while the efficient generation of high order harmonics from relativistic surfaces requires steep plasma density scale-lengths (L_p/λ < 1) the absolute efficiency of the harmonics declines for the steepest plasma density scale-length L_p → 0, thus demonstrating that near-steplike density gradients can be achieved for interactions using high-contrast high-intensity laser <b>pulses.</b> <b>Absolute</b> photon yields are obtained using a calibrated detection system. The efficiency of harmonics reflected from the laser driven plasma surface via the Relativistic Oscillating Mirror (ROM) was estimated to be in the range of 10 ^- 4 - 10 ^- 6 of the laser pulse energy for photon energies ranging from 20 - 40 eV, with the best results being obtained for an intermediate density scale-length...|$|R

40|$|Ever {{since it}} has been shown that two-dimensionally {{constricted}} superconductors can be used to detect single photons, effort has been invested to optimize such devices for applications. In most cases, the detection efficiency, defining the ratio of counted photons vs. incoming photons and hence the sensitivity of the device, is the most important parameter. However, depending on the applications, other parameters, like the <b>absolute</b> <b>pulse</b> strength or the dark count rate, might be important to adjust. Principally, such a superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD) consists of a very thin superconducting film, which is patterned into a narrow meandering line. To tune the properties of such devices, the optimization of the geometry and layout of such structures has already been the topic of several investigations within our group [1], [2].

40|$|Resizable {{elastomeric}} nanopores {{have been}} used to measure pulses of ionic current caused by carboxylated polystyrene spheres of diameter 200 nm and 800 nm. The nanopores represent a novel technology which enables nanoscale resizing of a pore by macroscopic actuation of an elastomeric membrane. Three different pores were employed with variable applied strain, transmembrane potential, particle concentration and sphere radius. Theory describing current pulse magnitude has been extended to conical pore geometry. A consistent method for interpretation of data close to the noise threshold has been introduced, and experimental data has been used to compare several methods for efficient, non-destructive calculation of pore dimensions. The most effective models emphasize the <b>absolute</b> <b>pulse</b> size, which is predominantly determined by the opening radius at the narrowest part of the roughly conical pores, rather than the profile along the entire pore length.

40|$|Receptor {{current and}} spiking {{responses}} were recorded simultaneously from isolated frog olfactory receptor cells using the suction pipette technique. Cells were stimulated with the odour cineole by rapid exchange {{of the solution}} bathing the olfactory cilia. The receptor current response to a 1 s odour stimulus increased in a graded manner over a 300 -fold range of odour concentration without clear saturation, and {{was accompanied by a}} train of action potentials. As the concentration of the odour stimulus increased, the frequency of firing increased also, until it saturated at the highest concentrations. The number of spikes evoked by the stimulus first increased and then decreased with increasing concentration, reaching a maximum at intermediate odour concentrations. The dose-response relation for spike firing rose at lower odour concentrations than the dose-response relation for the receptor current response. Adaptation to steady odour stimuli was investigated by exposing the cilia to a 4 s odour pre-pulse and then to a 1 s odour test pulse. As the pre-pulse concentration was increased the dose-response relations derived from the receptor current and spiking responses shifted to higher <b>absolute</b> test <b>pulse</b> concentrations. However the number of spikes fired in response to a given test pulse was little affected by the pre-pulse until, at the highest pre-pulse concentrations spike firing was abolished despite the continued presence of a receptor current response. The sensitivity of the receptor-current response to incremental stimuli fell with increasing pre-pulse concentration, declining with a limiting slope of 2. 4 in double logarithmic co-ordinates. The sensitivity determined from the spiking responses declined to zero at a lower pre-pulse concentration, reflecting the abolition of spike firing at pre-pulse concentrations which still evoked a graded receptor-current response...|$|R
40|$|Advertisement {{calls of}} {{closely related species}} often differ in {{quantitative}} features such as the repetition rate of signal units. These differences are important in species recognition. Current models of signal-receiver coevolution predict two possible patterns {{in the evolution of}} the mechanism used by receivers to recognize the call: (i) classical sexual selection models (Fisher process, good genes/indirect benefits, direct benefits models) predict that close relatives use qualitatively similar signal recognition mechanisms tuned to different values of a call parameter; and (ii) receiver bias models (hidden preference, pre-existing bias models) predict that if different signal recognition mechanisms are used by sibling species, evidence of an ancestral mechanism will persist in the derived species, and evidence of a pre-existing bias will be detectable in the ancestral species. We describe qualitatively different call recognition mechanisms in sibling species of treefrogs. Whereas Hyla chrysoscelis uses pulse rate to recognize male calls, Hyla versicolor uses <b>absolute</b> measurements of <b>pulse</b> duration and interval duration.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{report for the}} first time on the {{creation}} of thermal acceptors after laser irradiation of a phosphorous doped p-type silicon substrate in ambient atmosphere. The concentration of these defects up to 1020 cm− 3 is leading to a conductivity change from n- to p-type just beneath the surface. Electrochemical capacitance voltage (ECV) measurements followed by resistivity measurements confirm this conversion of conductivity. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) measurements show significant oxygen incorporation after laser irradiation. The comparison of saturation current density and lock-in thermography measurements of processed wafers in ambient and in nitrogen atmosphere reveal that these defects are electrically active recombination centres that disappear in absence of oxygen. In simulations of the temperature profile during laser processing a correlation between the pulse energy density (EP) and the appearance of thermal acceptors has been observed. The influence of these laser induced acceptor defects on solar cell parameters has been finally investigated. An efficiency loss of 1. 3 % <b>absolute</b> pertinent to <b>pulse</b> energies usually applied in laser doping process under ambient atmosphere could be avoided by laser processing in nitrogen atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{includes}} {{studies of}} improving {{the performance of the}} distributed fiber optic sensor based on Brillouin scattering, especially focusing on spatial resolution and frequency resolution. A novel distributed Brillouin sensor based on offset locking of two distributed feedback lasers has been developed. With offset locking technique, the beat frequency of two lasers can not only be locked together but also be tuned over a wide range of more than 1 GHz. Moreover, a lock-in amplifier has been applied to lock the bias drift of the electro optic modulator, which ensures the probe pulse stability and constant signal-to-noise ratio during the sensing measurement. With the offset locking based distributed Brillouin sensor, a 1 m spatial resolution and 0. 5 °C temperature resolution has been achieved. High spatial and frequency resolution Brillouin sensor with phase locking technique has been studied. A theoretical model dealing with laser source phase locking has been derived. Simulation and experimental results have been used to prove the ability {{of improving the}} spatial and frequency resolution with phase locking technique. Improving the spatial and frequency resolution with different pulse pair technique has been explored. This technique can obtain high spatial resolution (< 1 m) and high frequency resolution (< 35 MHz linewidth) simultaneously along several kilometer long sensing fiber, which is a promising candidate in the field of structure health monitoring. The ultimate measurement accuracy with different pulse pair Brillouin optical time domain analysis technique has been investigated and it is determined by the combination of the system bandwidth, system signal-to-noise ratio, <b>absolute</b> <b>pulse</b> width, pulse width difference, and the rise/fall time of the pulse. A Brillouin optical time domain analysis sensor based on optical differential parametric amplification technique has been proposed and realized to obtain high spatial and frequency resolution at the same time without increasing the measurement time. Anew theoretical model dealing with optical differential parametric amplification technique has been derived. An experiment is successfully realized to validate the proposal in a polarization maintaining fiber with a spatial resolution of 0. 5 m and a strain accuracy of 6 muepsilon...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background This work {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} whether methoxychlor (MTX) exposure may modify the ultradian secretion of prolactin through changes in the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) induced by N ω -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Associated changes in dopamine (DA) content in the anterior (AH), mediobasal (MBH) and posterior hypothalamus (PH) and median eminence (ME) were evaluated. Methods Two groups of animals (MTX and MTX+L-NAME treated) received subcutaneous (sc) injections of MTX at a dose of 25 mg/kg/day for one month. The other two groups of animals (control and L-NAME treated) received sc vehicle injections (0. 5 mL/day of sesame oil), during the same period of time to be used as controls. Forty hours before the day of the experiment, animals were anaesthetized with intrapritoneal injections of 2. 5 % tribromoethanol in saline and atrial cannulas were implanted through the external jugular vein. Plasma was continuously extracted in Hamilton syringes coupled to a peristaltic bomb in tubes containing phosphate-gelatine buffer (to increase viscosity). The plasma was obtained by decantation and kept every 7 minutes for the measurement of plasma prolactin levels through a specific radioimmnunoassay and DA concentration by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results Prolactin release in animals from all experimental groups analyzed was episodic. Mean plasma prolactin levels during the bleeding period, and the <b>absolute</b> <b>pulse</b> amplitude were increased after MTX or N ω -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) administration. However MTX and L-NAME did not modify any other parameter studied with the exception of relative pulse amplitude in MTX treated rats. L-NAME administration to rats treated with the pesticide reduced mean plasma prolactin levels and the absolute amplitude of prolactin peaks. Peak duration, frequency and relative amplitude of prolactin peaks were not changed in the group of rats treated with MTX plus L-NAME as compared to either control or MTX treated rats. Whereas MTX decreased DA content in the ME and increased it in the AH, its content did not change in the MBH or PH, as compared to the values found in controls. Also, L-NAME administration decreased DA content in the ME as compared to controls. However, L- NAME administration to MTX exposed rats, markedly increased DA content in the ME as compared to either MTX treated or control rats. L-NAME administration increased DA content in the AH as compared to the values found in non-treated rats. However L-NAME administration to MTX exposed rats did not modify DA content as compared to either MTX treated or control rats. L-NAME administration did not modify DA content at the MBH nor in saline treated nor in MTX treated rats. However, the values of DA in the MBH in MTX plus L-NAME treated animals were statistically decreased as compared to L-NAME treated rats. In the PH, L-NAME administration increased DA content as compared to the values found in non-treated animals. L-NAME administration to MTX exposed rats also increased DA content as compared to either MTX treated or control rats. Conclusion The results suggest the existence of an interaction between MTX and L-NAME in the modulation of the ultradian prolactin secretion at the pituitary levels. The possibility of an indirect effect mediated by changes in DA content at the ME requires further examination. </p...|$|E
40|$|To become fit an {{individual}} must generate optimal muscle strength and must develop cardiopulmonary reserve, or stamina. Physical fitness programmes require motivation, a graded series of appropriately designed exercises, and scientific surveillance.

40|$|Abstract—A {{compact and}} {{accurate}} readout {{system has been}} developed for high-rate spectroscopy with multi-element detec-tors. The fully self-triggered system multiplexes the signals from 32 detectors into a novel peak detector, which {{also serves as a}} derandomizer. The captured pulse heights are stored as analog samples before being presented to the ADC along with the cor-responding channel addresses. The peak detector incorporates a new two-phase configuration that cancels offsets and other errors found in conventional designs. Offset cancellation gives the peak detector rail-to-rail sensing and driving capability and permits two or more peak detectors to be operated in parallel to serve as a data-driven analog memory. First experimental results on the new peak detector and derandomizer (PDD) circuit, fabricated in 0. 35 m CMOS technology, include a 0. 2 % <b>absolute</b> accuracy for <b>pulses</b> with 500 -ns peaking time, 2. 7 -V linear-input range, 3. 5 -mW power dissipation, 250 -mV/s droop rate, and negligible dead time.

The spectra collected from the 32 -channel system show that the noise performance of the preamp/shaper is not degraded by the multiplexing, peak detecting, and derandomizing operations.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} a new defibrillating current waveform, consisting of a low-tilt 5 ms trapezoidal pulse followed closely by a second identical pulse of opposite polarity, was tested m seven isolated, perfused, working canine hearts suspended in an isoresistive, isosmotic shock bath at 37 oC. The {{efficacy and}} safety of the reciprocal pulse was compared with a single 5 ms pulse, a single 10 ms pulse, and a dual (unidirectional) 5 ms pulse waveform. The mean threshold average current densities for the 5 ms single pulse, 10 ms single pulse, dual 5 ms pulse, and reciprocal <b>pulse</b> (<b>absolute</b> values) were 50, 38, 36, and 37 mA/cm 2, respectively. The corresponding mean threshold energy densities in the shock bath were 2. 8, 2. 9, 2. 9, and 3. 1 mJ/cm 3. Despite the differences in threshold current density among the waveforms, no differences in safety factor (shock strength for 50 per cent post-shock depression, divided by threshold shock strength) were found among the waveforms. The current safety factors were 5. 4, 5. 4, 5. 6, and 5. 5 for the 5 ms single pulse, 10 ms single pulse, dual unidirectional pulse and reciprocal pulse, respectively. The corresponding energy density safety factors were 25, 27, 29, and 27.

40|$|Animals need to {{discriminate}} differences in spatiotemporally distributed sensory signals {{in terms of}} quality as well as quantity for generating adaptive behavior. Olfactory signals characterized by odor identity and concentration are intermittently distributed in the environment. From these intervals of stimulation, animals process odorant concentration to localize partners or food sources. Although concentration–response characteristics in olfactory neurons have traditionally been investigated using single stimulus pulses, their behavior under intermittent stimulus regimens remains largely elusive. Using the silkmoth (Bombyx mori) pheromone processing system, a simple and behaviorally well-defined model for olfaction, we investigated the neuronal representation of odorant concentration upon intermittent stimulation in the naturally occurring range. To the first stimulus in a series, the responses of antennal lobe (AL) projection neurons (PNs) showed a concentration dependence as previously shown in many olfactory systems. However, PN response amplitudes dynamically changed upon exposure to intermittent stimuli of the same odorant concentration and settled to a constant, largely concentration-independent level. As a result, PN responses emphasized odorant concentration changes rather than encoding <b>absolute</b> concentration in <b>pulse</b> trains of stimuli. Olfactory receptor neurons did not contribute to this response transformation which was due to long-lasting inhibition affecting PNs in the AL. Simulations confirmed that inhibition also provides advantages when stimuli have naturalistic properties. The primary olfactory center thus functions as an odorant concentration differentiator to efficiently detect concentration changes, thereby improving odorant source orientation over a wide concentration range.

40|$|A high-rate data {{system was}} {{required}} to capture the data for an airborne lidar system. A data system was developed that achieved up to 22 million (64 -bit) events per second sustained data rate (1408 million bits per second), as well as short bursts (less than 4 s) at higher rates. All hardware used for the system was off the shelf, but carefully selected to achieve these rates. The system was used to capture laser fire, single-photon detection, and GPS data for the Slope Imaging Multi-polarization Photo-counting Lidar (SIMPL). However, the system has applications for other laser altimeter systems (waveform-recording), mass spectroscopy, xray radiometry imaging, high-background- rate ranging lidar, and other similar areas where very high-speed data capture is needed. The data capture software {{was used for the}} SIMPL instrument that employs a micropulse, single-photon ranging measurement approach and has 16 data channels. The detected single photons are from two sources those reflected from the target and solar background photons. The instrument is non-gated, so background photons are acquired for a range window of 13 km and can comprise many times the number of target photons. The highest background rate occurs when the atmosphere is clear, the Sun is high, and the target is a highly reflective surface such as snow. Under these conditions, the total data rate for the 16 channels combined is expected to be approximately 22 million events per second. For each photon detection event, the data capture software reads the relative time of receipt, with respect to a one-per-second <b>absolute</b> time <b>pulse</b> from a GPS receiver, from an event timer card with 0. 1 -ns precision, and records that information to a RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) storage device. The relative time of laser pulse firings must also be read and recorded with the same precision. Each of the four event timer cards handles the throughput from four of the channels. For each detection event, a flag is recorded that indicates the source channel. To accommodate the expected maximum count rate and also handle the other extreme of very low rates occurring during nighttime operations, the software requests a set amount of data from each of the event timer cards and buffers the data. The software notes if any of the cards did not return all the data requested and then accommodates that lower rate. The data is buffered to minimize the I/O overhead of writing the data to storage. Care was taken to optimize the reads from the cards, the speed of the I/O bus, and RAID configuration...|$|R
40|$|On {{the sample}} of 32 fourth grade {{students}} of some Belgrade highs schools, who had the physical education classes carried out at the city’s swimming pools, {{an attempt was made}} to evaluate the effects of the two different programmes of swimming training in different intensity zones, defined relative to the anaerobic threshold. The subjects were divided into two sub-samples of 15 and 17 participants respectively. Before the research began there was no statistically significant difference between them, regarding the observed functional variables. The first training model consisted of swimming at the intensity level within the zone below anaerobic threshold, while the second model involved occasional swimming at a higher intensity sometimes surpassing the anaerobic threshold. The experimental programme with both sub-groups lasted 8 weeks with 3 training sessions per week, 2 of which were identical for both experimental groups, with the third one differing regarding the swimming intensity, this in the first group being still in the zone below, and in the second group occasionally in the zone above the anaerobic threshold. The amount of training and the duration were the same in both programmes. The aim of the research was to evaluate and to compare the effects of the two training models, using as the basic criteria possible changes of the 5 observed functional parameters: morning <b>pulse,</b> <b>absolute</b> and relative oxygen consumption, the heart frequency and the split time in 50 m swimming in the moment of reaching the anaerobic threshold. On the basis of the statistical analysis of the obtained data, it is possible to conclude that in both experimental groups there were statistically significant changes of average values concerning all the physiological variables. Although the difference in the efficiency of the applied experimental programmes is not determined, {{it can be said that}} both experimental treatments significantly influenced the improvement of the functional capabilities of the subjects...|$|R
40|$|River {{discharge}} {{and changes}} in lake, reservoir and wetland water storage are critical terms in the global surface water balance, yet they are poorly observed globally and the prospects for adequate observations from in-situ networks are poor (Alsdorf et al., 2003). The NASA-sponsored Surface Water Working Group has established a framework for advancing satellite observations of river discharge and water storage changes which focuses on obtaining measurements of water surface height (stage), slope, and extent. Satellite laser altimetry, which can achieve centimeter-level elevation precision for single, small laser footprints, provides a method to obtain these inland water parameters and contribute to global water balance monitoring. Since its launch in January, 2003 the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat), a NASA Earth Observing System mission, has achieved over 540 million laser pulse observations of ice sheet, ocean surface, land topography, and inland water elevations and cloud and aerosol height distributions. By recording the laser backscatter from 80 m diameter footprints spaced 175 m along track, ICESat acquires globally-distributed elevation profiles, using a 1064 nm laser altimeter channel, and cloud and aerosol profiles, using a 532 nm atmospheric lidar channel. The ICESat mission has demonstrated the following laser altimeter capabilities relevant to observations of inland water: (1) elevation measurements with a precision of 2 to 3 cm for flat surfaces, suitable for detecting river surface slopes along long river reaches or between multiple crossings of a meandering river channel, (2) from the laser backscatter waveform, detection of water surface elevations beneath vegetation canopies, suitable for measuring water stage in flooded forests, (3) single <b>pulse</b> <b>absolute</b> elevation accuracy of about 50 cm (1 sigma) for 1 degree sloped surfaces, with calibration work in progress indicating that a final accuracy of about 12 cm (1 sigma) will be achieved for clear atmosphere conditions, suitable for detection of stage changes through time, (4) ability to precisely point the spacecraft so as to position the laser profile on the Earth the surface with a cross-track accuracy of 50 m (1 sigma), enabling small water bodies and specific locations to be targeted and re-observed through time, (5) adequate signal levels from specular water surfaces up to 5 degrees off-nadir, enabling complete global access to any location on the Earth's surface from the ICESat repeat orbit by off-nadir pointing, and (6) day and night operation with successful laser ranging to the Earth's surface through thin to moderate cloud cover, enabling more frequent measurements than {{can be achieved by}} passive optical sensors.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{will present a}} study of two ion {{acceleration}} techniques based on high-intensity laser-plasma interaction that rely on radiation pressure (RP) effect, i. e momentum transfer from photons to the target. The framework of this work is the ultra-intense regime of laser-plasma interaction, in which an extremely high intensity (I ≥ 10 20 W/cm 2) laser pulse interacts with an ultrathin (i. e. few nanometers thick) solid target. Since the target transition to the plasma state occurs almost in- stantaneously, the irradiated foil {{can be regarded as}} a solid-density plasma, whose microscopical dynamics is dominated by the effects of the Ponderomotive Force. In the first part I will focus on the study, through 1 D numerical investigations, of the so-called Light Sail regime, in which the plasma is regarded as a mirror accelerated by the laser pulse and photons-target momentum transfer occurs during pulse reflection. In the LS regime a quasi- equilibrium state between the RP and the electrostatic pressure is required for prevent the target reflectivity to drop, and thus reach a stable and efficient acceleration. The RP effects are investigated, with a particular attention on polarization effects on the overall dynamics, focusing in the attempt to understand the transition threshold for which RP accelera- tion (RPA) becomes the dominant acceleration mechanism when a linearly polarized laser pulse is involved. With the RPA scheme it is in principle possible to achieve a compact and collimated ion beam and to reach ions energies up to the ≥ 100 M eV threshold, with the possibility to obtain a peaked, mono-energetic ion spectrum. Moreover, the aforementioned acceleration mechanism shows an high mechanical efficiency. While actual laser facilities can deliver laser pulses with a focused intensity I & 10 21 W/cm 2, the technical requirements for the exploitation of radiation pressure for ion acceleration are very demanding and the peak intensity of present day laser systems is not high enough to obtain a purely RPA dominated regime. At such high intensities, indeed, other heating mechanisms and strong non-linear effects occur, reducing the efficiency of RP. The pratical difficulties to reproduce this dynamics in a laboratory have made numerical investigation an invaluable tool for experimental campaigns, as fine structures can be more easily investigated in order to find the best parameters configuration to be used in actual experiments. The latest experimental and numerical RPA investigations have shown the development of Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability, i. e. the classical process occurring when a light fluid accel- erates an heavier one. This RT instability implies a reduction in the acceleration efficiency. Recently a novel way to achieve ions acceleration through RP have been presented by Zhou et al., with the aim to suppress the RT instabilities by reducing interaction time. The main idea of the authors is that the Thin Film Compressor (TFC) novel laser pulse com- pression technique may be used to obtain a single cycle ultra-intense laser pulse. In this regime, named Single Cycle Laser Acceleration (SCLA), the interaction time is shorter than instabilities growth rate, and thus it may lead to a favourable laser-ions energy transfer. Moreover, while the LS configuration requires high values of target reflectivity, the SCLA regime strongly relies on the exploitation of target transparency, as electrons are expelled from the target by the laser ponderomotive force and ions are accelerated by the strong longitudinal electrostatic field in- duced by charge separation. The work presented in the second main part of the thesis, will mainly deal with a numerical investigation of the SCLA regime, taking the work presented by Zhou et al. as a starting point. Since for such short interactions the pulse shape can be a relevant parameter, polarization ef- fects and <b>pulse</b> <b>absolute</b> phase variation on different plasma configuration have been studied in this regime as well as the laser intensity-thickness relation for maximizing ion acceleration effi- ciency. Once the best configuration have been obtained, the SCLA optimal regime is investigated...|$|R
