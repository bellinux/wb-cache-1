However, one of the major challenges in applications lies in engineering fibroin into a desired form using a convenient production technology. In this paper, fabrication of ultrafine powder from eri silk is reported.

Compared to dry and dry. wet <b>attritor</b> milling, wet process emerged as the preferred option as it caused less colour change and facilitated easy handling.

Unlike most reported powder production methods, this method could fabricate silk particles in a short time without any pre-treatment on degummed fibre. Moreover, the size range obtained is much smaller than that previously produced using standard milling devices. Reduction in fibre tenacity either shortened the milling time even further or helped bypassing media milling to produce fine powder directly through jet milling. However, such reduction in fibre strength did not help in increasing the ultimate particle fineness. The study also revealed that particle density and particle morphology could be manipulated through appropriate changes in the degumming process...|$|E

The microstructural evolution was characterized and evaluated for both the starting MA powders and PAS consolidated specimens by X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, differential thermal analyzer and atomic force microscopy. The microstructural refinement during MA processing in the Spex milled powders resulted in complete alloying of the initial elemental Fe and Al powders into a nanocrystalline solid solution after 20 h.

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of {{attrition}} {{and other forms of}} non-response on the representativity over time of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) sample born 1931 - 1941; the sample was initially drawn in 1992. Although some baseline characteristics of respondents do appear correlated with non-response over time, the 2002 sample of respondents does not appear to suffer significantly from selection on observables, except for race and ethnicity; for these two observables, longitudinal weights based on the Current Population Survey (CPS) can be used and are provided with the data set. We attribute this lack of selection to the fact that <b>attritors</b> who differ most eventually come back to the survey in waves prior to 2002. Although this allows cross-sections to remain fairly representative in later waves, it suggests that longitudinal analysis should use the unbalanced sample rather than the balanced sample of those interviewed in all waves. Individuals who attrit but who are recruited back into the survey are very different from those who are permanent <b>attritors</b> to the HRS. Finally, we investigate the selective nature of the decision of respondents to grant HRS permission to access their Social Security records and of the non-response introduced by employers of pension policyholders not providing HRS with worker's Summary Plan Descriptions.

Thus, change can be observed for <b>attritors</b> as well as for continued participants. These data are used to show that change in household composition, employment status or receipt of benefits has an influence on contact and cooperation rates in the following wave.

The latter model includes wave interaction effects. The first models allow for tracing of selectivity development, i. e. whether an initial selectivity might compensate or cumulates over time, the second to assessing {{the effects of the}} covariates in a specific wave, controlling for the base attrition effect.

40|$|Background: ‘Active ageing’ {{has been}} {{promoted}} as a strategy for extending {{quality of life and}} healthy life expectancy. However, there is limited evidence from nationally representative longitudinal studies on whether engagement among older adults is associated with better outcomes and few studies have considered possible bias arising from differential study attrition. Methods: We investigate associations between the engagement of people aged 50 – 69 in three types of activity with self-rated health and depression 2  years later using nationally representative longitudinal data from four European countries (Denmark, France, Italy and England). Data were drawn from waves 1 and 2 of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Multivariable analysis was used to analyse associations between baseline activity and outcomes at follow-up controlling for socioeconomic, demographic and health-related variables at baseline. Multiple imputation techniques and sensitivity analyses were undertaken to investigate possible bias arising from sample attrition. Results: Respondents in paid work at baseline {{were less likely to be}} depressed or to report poor or fair health at follow-up than those who were ‘inactive’, although not in Italy. Engagement in formal and informal activities was not significantly associated with health at follow-up. Sensitivity analyses showed that assuming that those in bad health were over-represented among study <b>attritors</b> weakened the association between work at baseline and health at follow-up.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} attrition in the KwaZulu-Natal Income Dynamics Study (1993 – 1998) and {{assesses the}} extent of attrition bias for a specific empirical example. The analysis shows that 1993 first round nonresponse is largely unrelated to observable characteristics of the communities other than indicators of migration activity. Multivariate regressions are then {{used to describe the}} characteristics of the households attriting in 1998, revealing the importance of distinguishing between two types of attriting households, those that moved and those that apparently moved but left no trace. For example, increased household size reduced the probability of either type of attrition, whereas measures of higher quality of fieldwork in the 1993 survey only reduced the probability that a household left no trace. While observable differences between <b>attritors</b> and non-attritors indicate attrition is nonrandom, it does not necessarily follow that estimated relationships based on the non-attriting sample suffer from attrition bias. To more directly explore attrition bias, which is by its nature model specific, this analysis estimates household-level expenditure functions correcting for attrition bias using standard Heckman selection procedures and a quality of 1993 interview variablesas identifying instruments. There is positive selection, and although many of the other parameter estimates are quite similar, a Hausman test rejects the equality of coefficients between the corrected and uncorrected models. Therefore, this study concludes, at least for this simple case, that attrition does appear to bias the “behavioral��� coefficients. BriefNon-PRIFPRI 1; MP- 17 FCN...|$|R
40|$|Panel (or longitudinal) data {{often provide}} an {{understanding}} of the dynamic behavior of individual households not possible with cross-sectional or time-series information alone. However, a disturbing feature of this type of survey in both developed and developing countries is that there is often substantial, nonrandom attrition. Therefore, an important concern {{is the extent to which}} attrition inhibits inferences made using the data. This note examines attrition in the KwaZulu-Natal Income Dynamics Study (1993 [...] 1998) and assesses the extent of attrition bias for a specific empirical example. The analysis shows that 1993 first round nonresponse is largely unrelated to observable characteristics of the communities other than indicators of migration activity. Multivariate regressions are then used to describe the characteristics of the households attriting in 1998, revealing the importance of distinguishing between two types of attriting households, those that moved and those that apparently moved but left no trace. For example, increased household size reduced the probability of either type of attrition, whereas measures of higher quality of fieldwork in the 1993 survey only reduced the probability that a household left no trace. While observable differences between <b>attritors</b> and non-attritors indicate attrition is nonrandom, it does not necessarily follow that estimated relationships based on the non-attriting sample suffer from attrition bias. To more directly explore attrition bias, which is by its nature model specific, this analysis estimates household-level expenditure functions correcting for attrition bias using standard Heckman selection procedures and a quality of 1993 interview variables iv as identifying instruments.
