5|$|In <b>acute</b> <b>poisoning,</b> typical {{neurological}} {{signs are}} pain, muscle weakness, numbness and tingling, and, rarely, symptoms associated with {{inflammation of the}} brain. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation are other acute symptoms. Lead's effects on the mouth include astringency and a metallic taste. Gastrointestinal problems, such as constipation, diarrhea, poor appetite, or weight loss, are common in <b>acute</b> <b>poisoning.</b> Absorption of large amounts of lead over a short time can cause shock (insufficient fluid in the circulatory system) due to loss {{of water from the}} gastrointestinal tract. Hemolysis (the rupture of red blood cells) due to <b>acute</b> <b>poisoning</b> can cause anemia and hemoglobin in the urine. Damage to kidneys can cause changes in urination such as decreased urine output. People who survive <b>acute</b> <b>poisoning</b> often go on to display symptoms of chronic poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Parathyroid glands {{are found}} in all adult tetrapods; they vary in their number and position. Mammals {{typically}} have four parathyroid glands, while other types of animals typically have six.

40|$|Inherited {{resistance}} to anticoagulant rodenticides {{was discovered in}} populations of Rattus norvegicus about 14 years ago. Similar resistance has now been reported from several countries in north-western Europe and from the USA. In order to detect resistance and to control it effectively, basic data on the susceptibility of rat populations are required for each country, and trapping surveys should be made in any area where resistance is suspected. <b>Acute</b> <b>poisons</b> are needed to control resistant rats although the shift from anticoagulants to <b>acute</b> <b>poisons</b> is a retrograde step as far as efficiency is concerned, and increases the hazard of control operations to man and other animals. Resistance to anticoagulants in Mus musculus has been reported from England, and resistant mice are probably {{to be found in}} other countries also in view of the great individual variation in susceptibility of this species to these rodenticides...|$|R
5|$|Aspirin {{overdose}} can be acute or chronic. In <b>acute</b> <b>poisoning,</b> {{a single}} large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, {{higher than normal}} doses are taken {{over a period of}} time. Acute overdose has a mortality rate of 2%. Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%; chronic overdose may be especially severe in children. Toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, including activated charcoal, intravenous dextrose and normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, and dialysis. The diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated spectrophotometric methods. Plasma salicylate levels in general range from 30–100mg/l after usual therapeutic doses, 50–300mg/l in people taking high doses and 700–1400mg/l following acute overdose. Salicylate is also produced as a result of exposure to bismuth subsalicylate, methyl salicylate, and sodium salicylate.|$|E
5|$|Only {{recently}} have attempts to improve {{health in the}} developing world concentrated on not only physical illness but also mental health. Deliberate self-harm is common {{in the developing world}}. Research into self-harm in the developing world is however still very limited although an important case study is that of Sri Lanka, which is a country exhibiting a high incidence of suicide and self-poisoning with agricultural pesticides or natural poisons. Many people admitted for deliberate self-poisoning during a study by Eddleston et al. were young and few expressed a desire to die, but death was relatively common in the young in these cases.

40|$|Background: <b>Acute</b> {{pesticide}} <b>poisoning</b> {{in developing}} countries is a considerable problem, requiring diagnosis and treatment. This study describes how training of health care workers in Uganda affects their ability to diagnose and manage <b>acute</b> pesticide <b>poisoning.</b> Method: A postintervention cross-sectional study was conducted using a standardized questionnaire. A total of 326 health care workers in Uganda were interviewed on knowledge and handling of <b>acute</b> pesticide <b>poisoning.</b> Of those, 173 health care workers had received training, whereas 153 untrained health care workers from neighboring regions served as controls. Results: Trained health care workers scored higher on knowledge of pesticide toxicity and handling of <b>acute</b> pesticide <b>poisoning.</b> Stratification by sex, profession, experience, and health center level {{did not have any}} influence on the outcome. Conclusions: Training health care workers can improve their knowledge and treatment of pesticide poisonings. Knowledge of the subject is still insufficient among health care workers and further training is needed...|$|R
25|$|In cattle, bracken {{poisoning}} {{can occur}} in both an acute and chronic form, <b>acute</b> <b>poisoning</b> being the most common.

40|$|The {{outcome of}} <b>acute</b> drug <b>poisoning</b> is good. In {{only a few}} {{occasions}} specific treatments are needed. Toxicological screenings are recommended when <b>acute</b> drug <b>poisoning</b> is suspected. In this retrospective observational study the impact of routine screening on treatment decisions was analyzed. All patients with <b>acute</b> drug <b>poisoning</b> admitted to the emergency department of our university hospital during one year (2013) were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were categorized into two groups: those who received specific therapies due to the poisoning and those who received only symptomatic treatment. Results: there were a total of 318 cases with <b>acute</b> drug <b>poisoning</b> of which 120 led to intensive care treatment. Toxicological screening was performed in 225 cases (70. 8 %). The screening tests were more often taken from patients who were unconscious (89 %) or had altered consciousness (79 %) than from patients with normal consciousness (63 %, P< 0. 001). The rate of specific treatment was higher among screened patients compared with patients without screening (18. 7 vs 1. 1 %, P< 0. 001). However, unexpected screening results were found in 37 of the 225 screened patients out of whom only 6 cases received specific treatment. Most patients with <b>acute</b> drug <b>poisoning</b> were toxicologically screened, but every sixth had an unexpected finding.

25|$|Prevention {{includes}} {{eating a}} diet low in mercury, removing mercury from medical and other devices, proper disposal of mercury, and not mining further mercury. In those with <b>acute</b> <b>poisoning</b> from inorganic mercury salts, chelation with either dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) or dimercaptopropane sulfonate (DMPS) appears to improve outcomes if given {{within a few}} hours of exposure. Chelation for those with long-term exposure is of unclear benefit. In certain communities that survive on fishing, rates of mercury poisoning among children have been as high as 1.7 per 100.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acute</b> <b>poisoning</b> is {{exposure}} to a poison on one occasion or during {{a short period of}} time. Symptoms develop in close relation to the exposure. Absorption of a poison is necessary for systemic poisoning. In contrast, substances that destroy tissue but do not absorb, such as lye, are classified as corrosives rather than poisons. Furthermore, many common household medications are not labeled with skull and crossbones, although they can cause severe illness or even death. In the medical sense, poisoning can be caused by less dangerous substances than those legally classified as a poison.|$|E

25|$|BPV-4 causes {{squamous}} cell carcinomas of the alimentary tract, and BPV-1/2 causes carcinomas and haemangioendotheliomas of the urinary bladder, {{in both cases}} in animals that have fed on bracken (Pteridium aquilinum). Such cancers are common in locations where grazing land is infested with bracken, such as the western Scottish Highlands, southern Italy and the Nasampolai Valley in Kenya. Bracken contains several immunosuppressants and mutagens, including quercetin and ptaquiloside. Consumption of large quantities by cattle leads to an <b>acute</b> <b>poisoning</b> syndrome with symptoms of bone marrow depletion, while at lower levels of long-term consumption it acts as a cancer cofactor. Carcinogenesis is a multistep process; tumours also contain activated Ras, as well as mutation or downregulation of the tumour suppressor genes p53 in alimentary tract cancers and fragile histidine tetrads (FHIT) in urinary bladder cancers. Viral particles are not produced in either alimentary tract or urinary bladder tumours.|$|E
25|$|As to the {{toxicity}} of philodendrons in cats, {{the evidence is}} conflicting. In one study, 72 cases of cat poisonings were examined, of which 37 resulted {{in the death of}} the cat. The symptoms of the poisoned cats included excitability, spasms, seizures, renal failure, and encephalitis. However, in another study, three cats were tube fed Philodendron cordatum and showed no signs of <b>acute</b> <b>poisoning.</b> In this study, two adult cats and one kitten were fed a puréed leaf and water mixture, observed afterward, then euthanized, and finally a necropsy was performed. Dosages of 2.8, 5.6, and 9.1 g/kg were used, with the highest dose administered being considerably more than any house cat could consume. The cats showed none of the symptoms found in past epidemiological studies and appeared normal. Necropsies showed nothing that would suggest toxicity. The past epidemiological studies have been suggested to be wrong, since sick cats may be inclined to eat plants to alleviate their illnesses. If this were the case, then such studies would be incorrectly attributing the sickness of the cats to the philodendrons. The forced feeding study may have failed to show signs of philodendron toxicity because the tube feeding bypassed the mouth and hence minimized the typical signs of irritation.|$|E

Using the WHO standard case definition of a possible <b>acute</b> pesticide <b>poisoning,</b> we investigated the prevalence and risk factors of <b>acute</b> work-related pesticide <b>poisoning</b> among farmers in Southern China. Methods A stratified sample of 910 pesticide applicators from two villages in southern China participated in face-to-face interviews. Respondents who self-reported having two or more of a list of sixty-six symptoms within 24 hours after pesticide application were categorized as having suffered <b>acute</b> pesticide <b>poisoning.</b> The association between the composite behavioral risk score and pesticide poisoning were assessed in a multivariate logistic model. Results A total of 80 (8. 8 %) pesticide applicators reported an <b>acute</b> work-related pesticide <b>poisoning.</b> The most frequent symptoms among applicators were dermal (11. 6 %) and nervous system (10. 7 %) symptoms.
