5|$|Despite {{manufacturing}} developments The Churchill Machine Tool Co {{experienced a}} lean period from 1921 to 1934, {{being unable to}} distribute <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> on its ordinary share capital. The commencement of European rearmament from 1935 is given {{as the cause of}} a dramatic turnaround in fortunes. <b>A</b> <b>dividend</b> of 12% was paid in that year; in the following year it was quadrupled and there was a special dividend of 125%. An adjustment to the share capital was made, and in 1938 the dividend was 40%, with an additional scrip bonus of 33.3%. There was a subsequent fall in the yield to 30%, but in cash terms, allowing for capital restructuring, the payment remained the same.|$|E
5|$|In 1889 the {{partnership}} {{was transformed into}} a limited company, Charles Churchill & Co Ltd (company registration number 29931). There followed a period of exceptional growth, and in 1896 <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> of 230% was paid on the company's share capital of £5,500.|$|E
5|$|In 1853, {{with income}} no longer meeting {{operational}} costs, the canal was leased to the Bristol and Exeter Railway. From 1854, the company started to pay <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> to its shareholders of 0.2%. Just ten years later, an Act of Parliament was obtained {{to sell the}} canal to the railway company and to abandon the Somerset section of the canal. The transfer took place on 13 April 1865, and the tub-boat canal was closed in 1867. The lifts were dismantled, {{and most of the}} route sold back to the original landowners.|$|E

5|$|In Southern Pacific Company v. Lowe, the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} where a {{shareholder}} receives <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> representing earnings of a corporation realized by the corporation prior to January 1, 1913, the dividend is not includible in the gross {{income of the}} shareholder for purposes of the Federal Income Tax Act of 1913, Ch. 16, 38 Stat. 114 (Oct. 3, 1913). No issues involving the definition of income with respect to wages, salary or other compensation for labor were decided by the Court.|$|E

Also, the firm will declare <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> of Π dollars. This will be given to the firm's sole shareholder, Crusoe himself.|$|E
5|$|From the 1840s, use of {{the river}} declined, {{as a result of}} {{competition}} from the railways, and changes in coastal shipping. Littlehampton grew in importance as a port and after years of resistance by the people of Arundel, the customs house was moved there in 1864. The Mid-Sussex Railway opened their line from Horsham to Pulborough and Petworth in 1859, which was extended to Ford and Littlehampton in 1863. Receipts from tolls had peaked at £2044 for the five years from 1835 to 1840, when <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> of 11.8 percent was paid, but dropped quickly, raising just £389 for years between 1870 and 1875, when the dividend was 1 percent.|$|E
50|$|Historically, <b>a</b> higher <b>dividend</b> yield {{has been}} {{considered}} to be desirable among many investors. <b>A</b> high <b>dividend</b> yield can {{be considered to be}} evidence that a stock is underpriced or that the company has fallen on hard times and future dividends will not be as high as previous ones. Similarly <b>a</b> low <b>dividend</b> yield can be considered evidence that the stock is overpriced or that future dividends might be higher. Some investors may find <b>a</b> higher <b>dividend</b> yield attractive, for instance as an aid to marketing a fund to retail investors, or maybe because they cannot get their hands on the capital, which may be tied up in a trust arrangement. In contrast some investors may find <b>a</b> higher <b>dividend</b> yield unattractive, perhaps because it increases their tax bill.|$|R

5|$|In 1821, {{revenue was}} 816,444 francs, {{and the company}} paid <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> of 555,500 francs. The company was able to raise its rates without {{reducing}} traffic. In 1822, the canal earned almost a million francs from carrying 243,200 tons of coal and 96,000 tons of other merchandise. The concession holders had repaid most of the debts they had incurred to build the canal, including many improvements since it was opened, {{and were able to}} pay healthy dividends. By 1824, the canal was giving annual revenues of 850,000 francs. An 1824 account described a superb water station at Givors on the right bank of the Rhone, an excellent basin at Rive-de-Gier for loading, fine buildings for administration of the canal and spacious shops and warehouses.|$|E
5|$|In 1868 and 1869, judgements {{went against}} the Met {{in a number of}} hearings, finding {{financial}} irregularities such as the company paying <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> it could not afford and expenses being paid out of the capital account. In 1870, its directors were found guilty of a breach of trust and ordered to compensate the company. Although they all appealed and were allowed in 1874 to settle for a much lower amount, to restore shareholders' confidence the directors had all been replaced by October 1872 and Edward Watkin appointed chairman. Watkin was an experienced railwayman and already on the board of several railway companies, including the South Eastern Railway (SER), and had an aspiration to construct a line from the north through London to that railway.|$|E
5|$|In 1950 Charles Churchill & Co, {{the parent}} company, moved its offices from London to Birmingham and in 1955 {{increased}} its share capital to £1.26M. By the financial year ending March 1962 it reported a group net profit of £575,352 and <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> of 22.5%. Exports were up 26% {{and there were}} hopes of the sector eventually amounting to 40% of total output. Fixed assets had increased significantly: the business had taken over Newcast Foundries Ltd, Halifax-based heavy lathe manufacturer Denhams Engineering Co Ltd and Churchill-Milnes; it had spent £2M of its own resources building extensions and plant improvements to more than double its manufacturing capability compared to that in 1951. Information regarding Churchill-Milnes is lacking but a business called Henry Milnes manufactured lathes in the Bradford area {{for many years and}} it may be that this was the target of a take-over.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} effect of {{convertible}} debt on the investment incentives facing stockholders. The effect depends critically on the value of existing assets relative to the firm's investment requirements. With <b>a</b> restrictive <b>dividend</b> covenant, convertible debt mitigates the overinvestment incentive associated with risky debt but exacerbates the underinvestment incentive at higher values of existing assets. <b>A</b> less‐restrictive <b>dividend</b> covenant exacerbates overinvestment under straight debt financing but reduces the underinvestment incentive induced by the conversion feature.

5|$|Undismayed by {{the loss}} of his papers, Bottomley {{embarked}} on an ambitious expansion scheme. On the basis of a lucrative contract to print the Hansard reports of debates in the Westminster parliament, at the beginning of 1889 he founded the Hansard Publishing Union Limited, floated on the London Stock Exchange with a capital of £500,000. Bottomley boosted the company's credentials by persuading several notable City figures to join the company's board of directors. These included Sir Henry Isaacs, the Lord Mayor-elect of London, Coleridge Kennard, co-founder (with Harry Marks) of the London Evening News, and Sir Roper Lethbridge, the Conservative MP for Kensington North. This board approved the purchase by Bottomley of several printing businesses—he used intermediaries to disguise his considerable personal profits from these transactions. He also persuaded the board to give him £75,000 as a down payment for some publishing firms in Austria for which he was negotiating, although the firms were not acquired. These outgoings and other expenses absorbed the Union's capital, and with few significant revenue streams it quickly ran out of money. Nonetheless, without any statement of accounts, in July 1890 Bottomley announced a profit for the year of £40,877, and declared <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> of eight per cent.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>dividend</b> is {{a payment}} {{made by a}} {{corporation}} to its shareholders, usually as a distribution of profits. When a corporation earns a profit or surplus, the corporation is able to re-invest the profit in the business (called retained earnings) and pay a proportion of the profit as <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> to shareholders. Distribution to shareholders may be in cash (usually a deposit into a bank account) or, if the corporation has <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> reinvestment plan, the amount can be paid by the issue of further shares or share repurchase.|$|E

5000|$|The {{easiest way}} for an {{investor}} to value <b>a</b> franked <b>dividend</b> is {{to think of the}} franking credit as part of the income they receive. The investor doesn't get it in cash, only as a kind of IOU from the tax office, but nonetheless it and the cash portion make up pre-tax income. Thus <b>a</b> franked <b>dividend</b> of $0.70 plus $0.30 credit is exactly equivalent to <b>an</b> unfranked <b>dividend</b> of $1.00, or to bank interest of $1.00, or any other ordinary income of that amount.

40|$|The {{question}} of <b>a</b> double <b>dividend</b> from revenue-neutral ecological tax reforms (an ecological advantage plus an economic advantage) has recently become a widely discussed topic both in real-world economic policy and in economic theory. The subject has produced many advocates and {{opponents in the}} scientific community. This paper examines potential economic dividends from revenue-neutral ecological tax reforms by systematically distinguishing between <b>an</b> efficiency <b>dividend</b> and <b>an</b> employment <b>dividend.</b> Their occurrence is discussed {{from the viewpoint of}} two different theoretical approaches: namely, the optimal taxation view and the market process view. According to the optimal taxation view, which dominates recent economic analysis on this subject, <b>an</b> efficiency <b>dividend</b> seems doubtful whereas <b>an</b> employment <b>dividend</b> is likely to occur under specific circumstances (e. g. involuntary unemployment and sub-optimal initial tax system). However, there is a considerable number of unsuitable assumptions which create doubt when questioning how appropriate the use of optimal taxation theory is when discussing real-world ecological tax reforms. The market process view enlarges the analysis by integrating effects on and from competition and innovation. This strengthens the occurrence of <b>an</b> employment <b>dividend</b> in <b>an</b> imperfect world with involuntary unemployment. In this framework the reduction of involuntary unemployment results from declining wage costs which boost labour demand, a shift in the bias of the innovation process, and an evolution of the consumption basket because of changing relative prices. environmental taxation, double dividend, market process theory, involuntary unemployment...|$|R
