5|$|By the 1870s, the OSN Company, {{owned by}} the Northern Pacific Railroad, was {{operating}} seven steamboats for transporting wheat <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> from the productive Palouse region along the Snake and Columbia to lower Columbia River ports. These boats were the Harvest Queen, John Gates, Spokane, Annie Faxon, Mountain Queen, R.R. Thompson, and Wide West, {{all of which were}} built on the Columbia River. However, there were more resources along the Snake River than wheat <b>and</b> <b>grain.</b> In the 1890s, a huge copper deposit was discovered at Eureka Bar in Hells Canyon. Several ships were built specifically to transport ore from there to Lewiston: these included Imnaha, Mountain Gem, and Norma. In 1893 the Annie Faxon suffered a boiler explosion and sank on the Snake below Lewiston.|$|E

5|$|Annealing is {{the process}} of heating the steel to a {{sufficiently}} high temperature to relieve local internal stresses. It does not create a general softening of the product but only locally relieves strains and stresses locked up within the material. Annealing goes through three phases: recovery, recrystallization, <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> growth. The temperature required to anneal a particular steel depends on the type of annealing to be achieved and the alloying constituents.|$|E

Insoluble carbohydrates, such as fiber (cellulose), are not digested by the horse's own enzymes, but are fermented by microbes in the cecum and large colon to break down and release their energy sources, volatile fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{many smaller}} Corvus species (such as American crow), ravens prefer {{undisturbed}} montane or forest habitat or rural areas over urban areas. In other areas, their numbers have increased dramatically {{and they have}} become agricultural pests. Common ravens can cause damage to crops, such as nuts <b>and</b> <b>grain,</b> or can harm livestock, particularly by killing young goat kids, lambs and calves. Ravens generally attack the faces of young livestock, but the more common raven behaviour of scavenging may be misidentified as predation by ranchers.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{is mainly}} on the ground, and the bird's diet {{consists}} mainly of seeds. Oily seeds, {{such as those of}} brassicas, are ignored in favour of more starchy items.

Grasses are also important, particularly cereals, <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> makes up {{a significant part of the}} food consumed in autumn and winter, wheat and oats being preferred to barley. When not breeding, yellowhammers forage in flocks which can occasionally number hundreds of birds, and often contain other buntings and finches.|$|E

Much of the country was occupied by German troops by the end of April. Also on 9 April, the Germans invaded and occupied Denmark.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, the new {{district}} of Lyallpur {{was formed to}} include the tehsils of Samundri and Toba Tek Singh with a sub-tehsil at Jaranwala, which later became a full tehsil in itself. The University of Agriculture, originally the Punjab Agricultural College and Research Institute, Lyallpur, was established in 1906. The Town Committee was upgraded to a Municipal Committee in 1909. Lyallpur grew into an established agricultural tool <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> centre.

40|$|Developmental {{changes in}} the starch and soluble sugars content of flag leaves <b>and</b> <b>grains</b> <b>and</b> the {{activities}} enzymes of sucrose metabolism in drought-tolerant (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Zagros) and drought-sensitive with high yielding potential under favorable conditions (cv. Marvdasht) wheat genotypes investigated under controlled water deficit during grain filling. Cultivars were grown in pots and treated with either well-watered (WW) or water-stressed (WS) from anthesis to maturity. WS caused a marked reduction in glucose, fructose and sucrose content of flag leaves <b>and</b> <b>grains</b> of sensitive cultivar. These changes were paralleled by sharp decline in the activity of cell wall invertase and soluble invertase at the both flag leaves <b>and</b> <b>grains</b> of sensitive cultivar. Whereas a transient surge in the activity invertases of flag leaves was found in tolerant cultivar. As the surge in invertase activity faded, in leaves <b>and</b> <b>grains</b> of tolerant cultivar it {{was replaced by a}} substantial increase in sucrose synthase activity as seed development proceeds. Notwithstanding increase in sucrose synthase activity in leaves <b>and</b> <b>grains</b> of sensitive cultivar, however this little raises could not be sufficiently active to compensate for decreased levels of invertases and might restrict sucrose export, and together with a concomitant repression in young ovaries, may limit sucrose transport and use and result in partial zygote abortion that led to dramatically reduction in number of kernel <b>and</b> subsequent <b>grain</b> yield under WS treatment in Marvdasht. </p...|$|R

5|$|O'Flaherty {{interprets the}} myth of Prithu—his {{transformation}} from a hunter who chased the earth-cow to the herdsman-farmer—as a transition in Vedic or Hindu people from eating beef to having cow's milk and cultivated vegetables <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> instead of beef. David Shulman compares Prithu with the Vedic deity Rudra-Shiva. Prithu, like Rudra, is an ideal king, but with a violent side. Prithu's actions of chasing the earth-cow as a hunter and finally milking her, display this terrifying side of the king. Both, Prithu and Rudra, are closely associated with sacrifice.|$|E

5|$|The adult Iago sparrow feeds {{mainly on}} the seeds of grass <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> (the main cereal crop grown in Cape Verde is maize), but also on insects and plant shoots. They can do damage to crops by eating young leaves, and like house sparrows will eat the food scraps {{available}} near houses. Nestlings, by contrast to adults, are fed almost exclusively on insects, especially caterpillars, flies, and orthopterans. The Iago sparrow forages mostly on the ground, moving restlessly whilst clinging to the ground like a mouse.|$|E
5|$|The {{fieldfare}} is omnivorous. Animal food in {{the diet}} includes snails and slugs, earthworms, spiders and insects such as beetles and their larvae, flies and grasshoppers. When berries ripen in the autumn these are taken in great number. Hawthorn, holly, rowan, yew, juniper, dog rose, Cotoneaster, Pyracantha and Berberis are all relished. Later in the winter windfall apples are eaten, swedes attacked in the field <b>and</b> <b>grain</b> and seeds eaten. When these are exhausted, or in particularly harsh weather, the birds may move to marshes or even the foreshore where molluscs are to be found.|$|E
