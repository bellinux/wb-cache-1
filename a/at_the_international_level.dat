5|$|The breed {{is popular}} for {{recreational}} and competitive driving, {{to which it}} is well suited in temperament. In 1997, the rules of driving events in France were modified {{to take into account the}} speed of execution of the course, which made lighter, faster horses more competitive. The Norman Cob and the lighter type of Boulonnais were particularly affected. The Norman Cob's gaits, calm temperament and willingness to master technical movements make it an excellent competitor, and in 2011, more than a third of the horses represented in the French driving championships were Norman Cobs. Many Norman Cobs represent France in driving events <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E

An analysis by Scientific American found a similar trend <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>level</b> when considering the global top selling PEVs over a 36-month introductory period.

5|$|Bred {{throughout}} France, the Selle Français {{has been}} exported worldwide, with additional stud books formed in Great Britain and the United States. Horses {{registered with the}} stud books must undergo inspections which judge their conformation, gaits and performance. Horses of other breeds who pass the inspections, including those of Thoroughbred, Arabian, Anglo-Arabian and French Trotter bloodlines, {{may be used for}} breeding, with the progeny able to be registered as Selle Français. Selle Français have proven successful <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>level</b> of competition in many equestrian disciplines. They are most commonly seen in show jumping, eventing and dressage, although they are also seen in combined driving, equestrian vaulting and competitive trail riding competitions. Selle Français and their riders have won numerous medals in the Summer Olympics and World Equestrian Games, including making up the entire gold-medal French teams in show jumping at the 2002 World Equestrian Games and eventing at the 2004 Summer Olympics.|$|E

5|$|Although Roberts {{won four}} Grand Nationals in 1976, he {{continued}} to experience mechanical misfortunes {{as well as a}} horsepower deficit to the Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the mile and half-mile dirt track events. He had been leading the Daytona 200 once again when tire troubles forced him to make a lengthy pit stop, and Johnny Cecotto {{went on to win the}} race. He dropped to third in the national championship as Jay Springsteen claimed the title for the Harley-Davidson team. He returned to England in April 1977, winning four out of six races at the 1977 Transatlantic Match races. Roberts then travelled to Italy where he raced in the Imola 200, leaving no doubt he was capable of competing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>level</b> by winning both legs and setting a new track record. He returned to the United States to compete in the Grand National championship where he won five of the six road races that made up the pavement portion of the series. In the road race event at Sears Point, Roberts started the race at the back of the pack and passed the entire field within four laps to win the race. Despite being in contention for much of the season, Roberts was unable to win any of the dirt track events and eventually finished the year in fourth place.|$|E

She {{announced that}} she had decided to take a break from competition and focus more on training and her personal life. In 2012, she {{announced that she}} would not be seeking a spot on the German team for the 2012 Summer Olympics, saying that her training duties had not given her time to properly prepare Herzruf's Erbe. She had ridden the horse at competitions during the 2011-2012 winter, and stated that she planned to compete at additional competitions during the winter of 2012-2013. However, in late 2012, the horse was put into a one-year rest period to help him recover from the injuries that had troubled him throughout his career. In October 2013, Salzgeber brought Herzruf's Erbe back into competition, winning a national show in Germany. The pair was successful at subsequent competitions, and in December 2013, it was announced that they had been returned to the German equestrian squad's A-team.|$|E
5|$|The IIHF {{assigned}} Norway's Hans Rønning as {{the referee}} for this game. The assignment was made {{based on his}} neutrality despite his inexperience officiating <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>level.</b> Upon hearing of Rønning's assignment, Canadian representative Dennis McDonald sought out IIHF supervisor of officials, René Fasel, hoping to convince him to select a different referee. Aside from the question of his competence to call a game of this magnitude, the Canadians were concerned about Rønning following an earlier game in the tournament he officiated between Canada and the United States. A wild brawl had broken out during the pre-game warm-ups against the Americans three days earlier. The officials {{were not on the}} ice when the melee occurred; however, Rønning ejected one player from each team at random for starting the brawl. Canadian captain Steve Chiasson was thus barred from the game against the Americans, as well as the following game after being assessed a match penalty. Unable to convince IIHF officials to change the assignment, McDonald was concerned about how the game would be played. Rønning's inexperience at that level was later identified as a significant cause of the brawl, as several stick infractions by both sides had gone uncalled, causing anger to rise between both teams.|$|E
