500|$|During the Iraq War Jackson {{admitted}} {{that the war was}} putting the service under strain, but called the claim that the Army was [...] "at breaking point", [...] "nonsense". Jackson was dismissive of claims that the Army was under-equipped, recalling his conversation with a soldier: [...] "There's a bit of a fuss going on about boots and bog rolls <b>and</b> <b>whatnot.</b> Are you all right for boots?" [...] He later conceded that this could be seen as [...] "cavalier", and that he [...] "had no intention of belittling the gravity of the situation", but that he [...] "didn't want {{to send a message to}} the enemy that we were in any way not ready". Known for speaking his mind, Jackson attracted media attention towards the end of his tenure as CGS in 2006, when he criticised Norman Kember for Kember's apparent lack of gratitude to the soldiers who freed him from Iraqi kidnappers.|$|E
500|$|Scalia was {{a devout}} Roman Catholic, {{and his son}} Paul entered the priesthood. Uncomfortable with the changes brought about {{following}} VaticanII, Scalia drove long distances to parishes he felt were more in accord with his beliefs, such as the Tridentine Latin Mass in both Chicago and Washington and also the Latin version of the Mass of Paul VI at St. Catherine of Siena in Great Falls, Virginia. In a 2013 interview with Jennifer Senior for New York magazine, Scalia was asked whether his beliefs extended to the Devil, and he stated, [...] "Of course! Yeah, he's a real person. Hey, c'mon, that's standard Catholic doctrine! Every Catholic believes that". When asked whether he had seen recent evidence of the Devil, Scalia replied: [...] "You know, it is curious. In the Gospels, the Devil is doing all sorts of things. He's making pigs run off cliffs, he's possessing people <b>and</b> <b>whatnot...</b> What he's doing now is getting people not to believe in him or in God. He's much more successful that way". In another 2013 interview, Scalia said, [...] "In order for capitalism to work, in order for it to produce a good and stable society, traditional Christian virtues are essential".|$|E

He said the introspective chorus made him {{take a moment}} to reflect on his own rhymes.

There was like 2,000 the first night, and another 2,000 on the second night. So it was like, 'Whoa, we sold out both shows!' I was already tired from the night before, and we already had booked the studio time in Seattle. I went there, and I finished the last four bars of the verse I wrote. I wrote most of the verse—the first eight bars—on bus. It was getting closer to the show, and I wrote the last four bars at the studio because, our meet and greets aren’t an hour anymore. There’s like 300 people or 400 people, so you’re there until 6 pm now instead of 3 or 4. Now we got to go the studio, and I gotta be on stage at 9 pm, so it’s coming down to the wire I still have to eat <b>and</b> <b>whatnot.</b> But I did it, and after I did it, I’m like, 'Ooh, the verse is elite.'" ...|$|E

500|$|For the Golden Gate International Exposition of 1939–1940 on Treasure Island, Pflueger {{joined a}} {{committee}} of well-known Beaux-Arts architects and was frustrated in establishing a more modern design scheme, though his own Federal Building amply demonstrated the new direction he espoused. Pflueger's contributions were among the few buildings at the Exposition that received positive reviews. When the Exposition's investors failed {{to turn a profit}} in 1939, they decided to extend the fair another year. For the summer of 1940, Pflueger put together a large exhibit of Art in Action, showing a number of artists on display, engaged in creating works. Alfred Frankenstein of The New York Times visited in June and wrote [...] "Here the visitor is privileged to observe a kind of twenty-ring circus of art... On the floor, in a series of little ateliers, sculptors, painters, lithographers, etchers, ceramicists, weavers <b>and</b> <b>whatnot</b> are at work under the direct observation of the public." [...] Pflueger once again brought Diego Rivera to San Francisco, this time to serve as the main attraction at [...] "Art in Action". Rivera painted Pan American Unity on ten steel-framed panels spanning 74 feet in width and reaching 22 feet in height. For the second time, Rivera included Pflueger in a mural of his. Some 68 artists had participated by the end of September when the Exposition was closed. Rivera was not finished, however; he and two assistants labored for two more months in the empty exposition hall. On November 30 and December 2, 30,000–35,000 visitors came to Treasure Island to view the completed mural. On December 8, 1940, Rivera's 54th birthday, Kahlo and Rivera were married {{for the second time in}} a civil ceremony at San Francisco City Hall.|$|E

Coming from humble beginnings themselves, they {{believe that there are}} many undiscovered dancers whose talents are worth seeing on television and whose dreams are worth fulfilling. Focus E, Incorporated and GMA Network, in harmony with the group’s belief, put together a dance reality show that will not only entertain but more importantly, capture a global quality of dancing. There will be rigorous training, unexpected challenges, various dance themes, wild transformations and a grand prize worth half a million pesos (250, 000 cash and 250,000 worth of contract) -all in the name of selecting and honing the one best dancer. To host the show are no less than the Badboy of the Dance Floor Mark Herras and Sexbomb Diva Izzy Trazona. Since the hopefuls are unavoidably budding showbiz personalities, they will be tested on and off the stage. From Monday to Friday, the sizzling duo of Mark and Izzy will update audiences about their progress, setbacks, personal issues <b>and</b> <b>whatnots.</b> As the hopefuls bust their moves, they will be under the meticulous eye of judges composed of choreographer extraordinaire Maribeth Bechara, Sexbomb leader Rochelle Pangilinan and a surprise guest of the week.

Who will deliver the loudest bomb on the dance floor and grab the coveted title of Sexbomb dancer? ...|$|R

5000|$|I Am was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 64, based on 5 reviews. David Jeffries of AllMusic gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, saying [...] "Like so many rappers who play it street level and live and die by the mixtape game, Memphis man Yo Gotti has maintained an uneasy relationship with the official album. His early work was indie to a fault, with long-players sounding patched together from mixtape numbers <b>and</b> other related <b>whatnot,</b> while his mainstream debut, 2012's Live from the Kitchen, suffered from its long birthing process, sounding patched together on the million-dollar level with too much input from the marketing department. Good news for fans who stuck it out this long is that I Am is the moment when the skies clear, as the album comes on strong with a hard-hitting set of openers, and then, the high quality is maintained with a set of easy-flowing supportive songs that broaden the LP spectrum, all without leaving Gotti's comfort zone." [...] Ronald Grant of HipHopDX gave the album {{two and a half stars}} out of five, saying [...] "At the end of the day, I Am’s overall passable production and flashes of potency and strength keep it afloat for a time. And Gotti deserves commendation for his talent at bringing an explicit rawness, reality and affection to his autobiographical bars. But even those considerations aren’t enough to make this album worth more than a few listens, sadly relying on a continuous set of monotonous hooks and overly used trap beats that saturate a strong majority of current popular Rap music." [...] Reed Jackson of XXL gave the album an L, saying [...] "On the majority of I Am, he stays rooted in the ideas and melodies that he’s been refining since he first dropped From Da Dope Game 2 Da Rap Game over 10 year ago. The self-proclaimed “King Of Memphis” has lived up to his title again, and perhaps this album will help him continue his reign for another 10 years." ...|$|R
