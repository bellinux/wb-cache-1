40|$|Recent {{data suggest}} that the {{fortunes}} of unskilled workers in developed countries improved during the 1990 s, after deteriorating significantly during the 1980 s. Such a trend could be explained by <b>a</b> faster <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> the relative supply of unskilled labour, <b>a</b> slower <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> the relative demand for unskilled labour, or a shift in labour market institutions. This paper argues that the improvement almost always reflected <b>a</b> slower <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> relative demand. Further research will be required to discover why the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> demand for unskilled labour decelerated...|$|R

5|$|It is {{speculated that}} cowrie shells {{may have been}} the {{principal}} currency at Gedi. Cowrie shells have been recovered in the store rooms of the houses and found in greater abundance than struck coins, represented by only two coins of Chinese origin. The use of cowries as currency is supported by their historical use as tender in various parts of Africa, and Kirkman estimated the exchange rate of cowrie shells to the gold dinar to be 400,000 to 1. However, there are examples of locally struck coins at contemporary sites, but none have been recovered at Gedi. The use of beads as a currency has also been proposed by J. F. Schofield, who claims that <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> the number of beads recovered in the upper stratigraphic layers reflects <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> their value around the fifteenth century.|$|E

5|$|Other {{marine mammal}} prey species include nearly 20 species of seal, sea lion and fur seal. Walruses and sea otters are less {{frequently}} taken. Often, to avoid injury, killer whales disable their prey before killing and eating it. This may involve throwing {{it in the}} air, slapping it with their tails, ramming it, or breaching and landing on it. Sea lions are killed by head-butting or after a stunning blow from a tail fluke. In the Aleutian Islands, <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> sea otter populations in the 1990s was controversially attributed by some scientists to killer whale predation, although with no direct evidence. The decline of sea otters followed <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> harbour seal and Steller sea lion populations, the killer whale's preferred prey, which in turn may be substitutes for their original prey, now decimated by industrial whaling.|$|E
