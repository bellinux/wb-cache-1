SEKUCo grew in both number of {{students}} as in number of courses, including a new department of eco-tourism and nature conservation. The University College is located in the Lushoto District in the Western Usambara Mountains in Tanzania. This region is famous for its tropical rain forest, rich in biodiversity and the mountains are an important watershed for Panga and Umbara rivers that supply water for various uses. However, there have been severe degradations of forests and basically the remaining pockets are still experiencing a lot of pressure from local communities for different purposes like commercial logging for wood supplies and slash and burn practices for agricultural purposes. An overexploitation of the land, due to a growing population struggling for means of livelihood, leads to environmental problems such as soil erosion and a decline in soil fertility. Challenges for future development in this region are therefore to tackle these problems and to simultaneously make use of the many trumps the region holds, including potentials for nature conservation as well as sustainable eco-tourism. Looking to the future is looking to the students of today and high quality education that aims to increase sustainable land use is indispensable. In order to support the education programme within the department of eco-tourism and nature conservation and to increase local knowledge on land use planning and design, a design workshop will be organized from 24 / 01 / 2011 until 28. 01 / 2011 by the Catholic University of Leuven, department of earth and environmental sciences, Belgium. The project area of the workshop includes the SEKUCo campus within its broader environment. The central idea is to develop a route and to define options for landscape improvement and ecotouristic development along this route, taking into consideration arguments of sustainability of the Western Usambara and local participation. The workshop will <b>a.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>include</b> identification of stakeholders involved, a SWOT analysis of the area, the development of an album of pictures, stories and storylines, development of a masterplan and selection of key locations on the route for further analysis and design, etc. Not everything will be “finished” in a week’s time, but in the first place this project should become a trigger for a multiplicative process of greater detail, growing local involvement and long term vision for ecotouristic development in the Western Usambaras. status: publishe...|$|E

In the wee hours of September 27, 1922, the Bank of Montreal was robbed. That same night, a bank was robbed in Moosomin. The robbery attracted a great deal of attention, and was the front page story of the Regina Leader for three days in a row. The story was even mentioned in two novels, though it was represented very inaccurately in both. A very good (and exciting) account of the bank robbery by <b>A.</b> <b>O.</b> Smith is <b>included</b> in Ceylon’s first history book, Builders of a Great Land. During the Prohibition of the 1920s, there was also allegedly some rum running that went on in the area.|$|R

40|$|Throughout life, we {{continuously}} accumulate data, {{information and}} knowledge. The ability to recall {{much of this}} accumulated knowledge commonly deteriorates with time, though some forms {{part of what is}} referred to as tacit knowledge. In the context of education, students access and interact with a teacher’s knowledge in order to create their own, and may have their own data, information and knowledge that could be added to teacher’s knowledge for everyone’s benefit. The realization that students can contribute to enhancing personal knowledge is an important cornerstone in developing a mentor (teacher, tutor and facilitator) focused knowledge system. The research presented in this thesis discusses an integrated framework that manages an individual’s personal data, information and knowledge and enables it to be enhanced by others, {{in the context of a}} blended teaching and learning environment. Existing related models, structures, systems and current practices are discussed. The core outcomes of this thesis include: • the virtualMe framework that can be utilized when developing Web based teaching and learning systems; • the sniplet content model that can be used as the basis for sharing information and knowledge; • an annotation framework used to manage knowledge acquisition; and • a multimedia object (MMO) model that: o allows for related media artefacts to be intuitively grouped in <b>a</b> logical collection; <b>o</b> <b>includes</b> <b>a</b> meta-data schema that encompasses other metadata structures, and manages context and referencing; and <b>o</b> <b>includes</b> <b>a</b> model allowing component parts to be reaggregated if they are separated. The virtualMe framework provides the ability to retain context while transferring the content from one person to another and from one place to another. The framework retains the content’s original context and then allows the receiver to customise the content and metadata so that the content becomes that person’s knowledge. A mechanism has been created for such contextual transfer of content (context retained by the metadata) ...|$|R
30|$|In both works [29, 30], {{the authors}} {{considered}} networks supporting single application where the nodes join the network at same time. The performance metrics they considered were packet loss, end-to-end packet delay, and energy consumption. In our work, the networks deployed support multiple applications and the sensor nodes join the network {{at different times}} what demands a node synchronization mechanism. In order to characterize the performance of our system, we used <b>a</b> set <b>o</b> metrics <b>including</b> end-to-end packet delay, energy consumption, query success ratio, and fairness Index. Query success ratio (QSR) quantifies {{the success of a}} sink node with respect to the reception of all the expected reply packets upon the transmission of a query packet; this metric allows us to see if all the nodes receive the query packets and if they reply back. Therefore, it is easy to verify packet loss. The fairness index metric is used to investigate if the nodes have the same opportunity to reply back to the sink. We used ContikiOS/Cooja for the simulations and validated our work by implementing two testbeds.|$|R

We have reported that <b>A</b> <b>o</b> promote Ca 2 + entry, mitochondrial Ca 2 + overload and apoptosis in cultured cerebellar neurons. However, recent evidence suggests {{that some of these}} effects could be induced by glutamate receptor agonists solved in F 12, the media in which <b>A</b> <b>o</b> are prepared. Here we have tested the effects of different media on <b>A</b> <b>o</b> formation and on cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]cyt) in rat cerebellar and hippocampal cell cultures. We found that <b>A</b> <b>o</b> prepared according to previous protocols but solved in alternative media including saline, MEM and DMEM do not allow oligomer formation and fail to increase [Ca 2 +]cyt.

However, QTc prolongation of more than 30 milliseconds only occurred at one time point (2 hours) after oral <b>As</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3, resulting in QTc of more than 500 milliseconds in 3 of 16 patients, all within 4 hours of oral <b>As</b> 2 <b>O</b> 3.
