5|$|As {{production}} of the B-47 came to an end, the Wichita factory was phased in for B-52D production, with Seattle responsible for 101 D-models and Wichita 69. Both plants continued to build the B-52E, with 42 built <b>at</b> <b>Seattle</b> and 58 at Wichita, and the B-52F (44 from Seattle and 45 from Wichita). For the B-52G, it was decided in 1957 to transfer all production to Wichita, which freed up Seattle for other tasks (in particular the {{production of}} airliners). Production ended in 1962 with the B-52H, with 742 aircraft built, plus the original two prototypes.|$|E
5|$|Much like Week1 in Chicago {{five years}} back, in Week4 <b>at</b> <b>Seattle,</b> Johnson was {{involved}} in another controversial play. This time, late in the fourth quarter, Seahawks safety Kam Chancellor punched {{the ball out of}} Johnson's hands while he was trying to score a late go-ahead touchdown. Linebacker K. J. Wright then batted the ball out of the end zone for a touchback. The NFL later admitted the referees should have penalized Wright for illegal batting. The Seahawks won the game by a score of 1310.|$|E

5|$|Lexie Grey is the {{daughter}} of Thatcher Grey (Jeff Perry) and his second wife, Susan Grey (Mare Winningham). She grew up with her younger sister, Molly Grey-Thompson (Mandy Siegfried) and throughout her childhood was kept unaware that she also had an older half-sister, Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), born to Thatcher and his first wife, Ellis Grey (Kate Burton). Lexie is first mentioned when Molly is admitted to Seattle Grace Hospital, with Susan informing Meredith that Lexie is a student at Harvard Medical School. At some subsequent point, Lexie learns of Meredith's existence. She graduates from medical school and is accepted to take her surgical internship at Mass General hospital, but following her mother's sudden death from complications stemming from the hiccups, Lexie instead opts to move back to Seattle to be closer to her father, taking up an internship <b>at</b> <b>Seattle</b> Grace Hospital, one year behind Meredith who is due to begin her residency.|$|E
5|$|Schmid {{lives in}} Bellevue, Washington, during the soccer season. He {{is married to}} Valerie and has four children: Erik, Lacey, Kurt, and Kyle.

Kyle is now an assistant coach at Cal State Fullerton. Sigi has rarely missed game days in the MLS, but took time off for Lacey and Kurt's weddings and Kurt's college graduation. Schmid's younger brother, Roland, lives in Sammamish, Washington, and having family in the area was one of the factors which persuaded Schmid to accept the job <b>at</b> <b>Seattle.</b> He also has a nephew and a niece named Graham and Mackenze.|$|E
5|$|Seattle {{has been}} a {{regional}} center {{for the performing arts}} for many years. The century-old Seattle Symphony Orchestra is among the world's most recorded and performs primarily at Benaroya Hall.

5|$|The aircrews trained {{continuously}} until May. Each bombardier {{completed at}} least 50 practice drops of inert pumpkin bombs before Tibbets declared his group combat-ready. The ground support echelon of the 509th Composite Group received movement orders and moved by rail on 26 April 1945 to its {{port of embarkation}} <b>at</b> <b>Seattle,</b> Washington. On 6 May the support elements sailed on the SS Cape Victory for the Marianas, while group materiel was shipped on the SS Emile Berliner. An advance party of the air echelon flew by C-54 to North Field, Tinian, between 15 and 22 May. It was joined by the ground echelon on 29 May 1945, marking the group's official change of station. It was from Tinian that it carried out the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|During Shepherd's surgery, {{his hand}} becomes numb, and he frustratedly exits the {{operating}} room. In the intern appendectomy, Wilson {{makes a mistake}} and freezes, leading to a scolding from Meredith Grey. Back in Minnesota, Yang is annoyed by the peppy attitudes of her superiors at Mayo Clinic, Dr. Craig Thomas (William Daniels) and Dr. Parker (Steven Culp), so she decides to take a trip to Seattle for Sloan's death. However, her PTSD hinders her from boarding the plane, and she ultimately remains in Minnesota. Meanwhile, Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams), now a plastic surgical fellow, sits by Sloan's bedside and talks of medical cases to him. Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) enters Sloan's hospital room and removes him from life support. Unable to cope with Sloan's death, Meredith Grey boards a plane to visit Yang, but panics before it takes off. Shortly thereafter, Meredith Grey finds Karev at the airport bar, where he reveals {{that he will be}} staying <b>at</b> <b>Seattle</b> Grace Mercy West Hospital. The next morning, Hunt visits Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) at her family's farm, and asks her to begin working in Seattle again. At the conclusion of the episode, Torres returns home to Robbins, who is revealed to have had her lower left leg amputated {{as a result of the}} crash.|$|E
5|$|Lexie's death devastates Meredith, who {{is still}} desperately trying to find her husband. Eventually, she and Shepherd reunite and they fix his hand as best as they can. Meanwhile, back <b>at</b> <b>Seattle</b> Grace Mercy West Hospital, no one is aware of what has {{happened}} to the other doctors. Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) prepares the annual dinner for the departing residents, which Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams), and Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) are dreading. Avery makes the choice to take a job offer at Tulane Medical Center, and he and Kepner share a moment. Dr. Ben Warren (Jason George) and Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) decide to get married, even though Warren is going to start his surgical internship in Los Angeles. After realizing Dr. Teddy Altman (Kim Raver) was offered a chief position at United States Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) and is refusing to leave Seattle out of loyalty, Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), the chief of surgery, fires her to free her from the hospital where her husband died. As the episode ends, Hunt picks up his messages to discover the surgical team never made it to Boise. The residents, finally excited to celebrate at Webber's dinner, are left waiting for their stranded friends. The remaining crash survivors are left struggling to stay awake as their last match goes out. In the closing monologue, Meredith repeats the opening to the speech that Webber gave in the pilot episode of the series.|$|E
