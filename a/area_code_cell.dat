40|$|AIM:To {{analyze the}} {{relationship}} of carbonic anhydrase Ⅱ gene polymorphism with primary open angle glaucoma genetic susceptibility. METHODS:From January 2012 to December 2014, 50 cases in our hospital for treatment of primary open angle glaucoma(study group) and 50 cases in outpatient department of our hospital for health examination(control group) were tested. The conventional elbow venous blood was taken. The use of polymerase chain reaction(PCR) and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} test were used to detect the characteristics of carbonic anhydrase Ⅱ gene polymorphism. RESULTS:The locus site of rs 3758078 and rs 10504813 of the two groups were in line with Hardy - Weinberg equilibrium law(Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium). The results displayed in rs 10504813 site, the difference of genotype frequencies between the two groups was not statistically significant(P > 0. 05). But the difference in allele frequencies between the two groups was statistical significance(P P > 0. 05). After the carbonic anhydrase Ⅱ polymorphism haplotype analysis in the two groups, TAC(Tracking <b>area</b> <b>code</b> of <b>cell</b> served by neighbor Enb) haplotype carriers appeared lawer risk of primary open-angle glaucoma. CONCLUSION:There is certain relation between the polymorphism and the risk of carbonic anhydrase primary open-angle glaucoma, and rs 3758078 locus balance may be the main reason for low risk; TAC haplotype carriers appear lower risk of primary open angle glaucoma...|$|R

The complexity of the information required to <b>code</b> <b>cells</b> for the construction of entire organisms is so enormous that we assume that the code must make combinatorial use of members of large multigene families.

We discuss our evidence indicating that receptors of these families are expressed in many parts of developing embryos and suggest that they play a key functional role in cell recognition and targeting not only in the olfactory system but also throughout the brain and numerous other organs as they are assembled...|$|R

40|$|Mobile Broadband (MBB) {{traffic is}} {{increasing}} rapidly, and {{is estimated to}} keep growing in future due to the availability of high speed 3 G/ 4 G networks and the popularity of mobile devices. People are accessing Internet irrespective of their locations and time thus introducing mobility in the access paradigm and making MBB as a future of the Internet. The expansion of MBB traffic necessitates the detail study {{of the characteristics of}} MBB networks with regards to network performance and reliability. It is observed that the literature towards the study of MBB performance mostly concern static scenarios. Therefore, in this thesis, effects of mobility on MBB performance are studied, and the QoS performance of Norwegian MBB networks under mobility are compared to provide a realistic view of the QoS characteristics experienced by the end-users. For this, performance metrics such as delay, packet loss, connectivity are measured for four operational MBB networks under mobility simultaneously using NorNet Edge (NNE), the dedicated testbed for experimentation and measurements in MBB networks. Measurements in different speed are examined to see how speed affects MBB performance. Radio conditions such as Local <b>Area</b> <b>Code</b> (LAC), <b>Cell</b> Identification (CellID) are also investigated to establish relation between the measured performance and physical locations as well as cell attachment and handover behaviors. Mode and Submode are also observed to see 2 G/ 3 G networks coverage and packet distribution in HSPA+, HSDPA, HSUPA, WCDMA and EDGE networks. The results of this thesis show that MBB performance is affected (degraded) by mobility, but degree varies with respect to performance metrics. It was found that MBB operators under mobility perform differently even though the underlying technology is same...|$|R
