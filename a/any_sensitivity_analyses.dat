40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIObjectives We {{conducted}} a systematic {{survey of the}} methodological literature to identify recommended approaches for how and what randomised clinical trial (RCT) authors should report on missing participant data and, {{on the basis of}} these approaches, to propose guidance for RCT authors. Methods We defined missing participant data (MPD) as missing outcome data for trial participants. We considered both categorical and continuous outcome data. We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Methodology Register for articles in which authors proposed approaches to reporting MPD from RCTs. We selected eligible articles independently and in duplicate and extracted data in duplicate. Using an iterative process of discussion and revisions, we used the findings to develop guidance. Results Of 10501 unique citations identified, 13 articles reporting on 10 approaches proved eligible. The identified approaches recommend reporting the following aspects (from most to least frequently recommended) : number of participants with MPD (n= 10), reasons for MPD (n= 7), methods used to handle MPD in the analysis (n= 4), flow of participants (n= 3), pattern of missingness (eg, whether at random) (n= 3), differences in rates of MPD between trial arms (n= 2), differences between participants with and without MPD (n= 2), results of <b>any</b> <b>sensitivity</b> <b>analyses</b> (n= 2), implication of MPD on interpreting the results (n= 2) and methods used to prevent missing data (n= 1). We propose a guide with nine items related to reporting the number, reasons, patterns, analytical methods and interpretation of MPD. Conclusions Most identified approaches invite trial authors to report the extent of MPD and the underlying reasons. Fewer approaches focus on reporting missingness patterns, methods for handling MPD and implications of MPD on results. Our proposed guidance could help RCT authors to better report, and readers to better identify participants with missing data...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Environmental Systems, Mathematical Modeling, 2007 Individual-based models (IBMs) are a {{relatively}} new way to perform population modeling of a particular species. In this type of modeling, population level dynamics emerge {{as the result of}} actions of individuals, as members of the population make choices regarding habitat due to influence by environmental factors as well as competition from other members of the species. There are very few, if <b>any,</b> <b>sensitivity</b> <b>analyses</b> of individual-based ecological models reported in the literature. This is in part due to the recent advent of this type of modeling, as well as the overall complexity of the models themselves. The intention here is to demonstrate a method of analyzing an IBM so that relevant information is provided to the modeler regarding the strong and weak points of the model {{in the face of the}} uncertainty in parameter values, while consuming a minimum of time and computational resources. In addition, this type of information will be useful to resource managers looking to support management decisions, as it will provide indications of how much confidence can be put into model output because the effects of parameter uncertainty on alternative management actions will be included in the ranking with regards to the efficacy of each proposed action. In this fashion, the model will aid resource managers to better understand the risk of making false predictions. An individual-based model, inSTREAM v. 4. 05 (Railsback et al, 2004), was used to model a population of northern California coastal cutthroat trout in Little Jones Creek, a third order tributary of the Smith River in northern California. In this model, trout make daily habitat selection choices to maximize their fitness. The decision rules that govern these choices are influenced by the daily conditions within the modeled stream, various mortality risks, as well as factors concerning respiration, growth and reproduction. The uncertainty in 90 parameters of the model was analyzed. Effects of parameter uncertainty were investigated in a three-phase process. The first phase ranked the parameters based on a sensitivity index which reflected how much the uncertainty in parameter value affected model output. In the second phase, the relative level of higher-order interactions amongst the parameters with the highest sensitivity index was assessed. The third phase tested the robustness of model output, by varying all of the most sensitive parameters simultaneously, when evaluating proposed alterations to the watershed. The model was found highly sensitive to some parameters, moderately sensitive to most, and not sensitive at all to a few. Although varying two high-sensitivity parameters at a time did generally have a non-linear effect on model output, the model was able to reproduce the same population trends under multiple parameter perturbation as it did when only calibrated parameter settings were used...|$|E
40|$|Background: Postinfectious cough {{is common}} in primary care, but has no proven {{effective}} treatments. Cysteinyl leukotrienes {{are involved in the}} pathogenesis of postinfectious cough and whooping cough (pertussis). We investigated the effectiveness of montelukast, a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist, in the treatment of postinfectious cough. Methods: In this randomised, placebo-controlled trial, non-smoking adults aged 16 - 49 years with postinfectious cough of 2 - 8 weeks' duration were recruited from 25 general practices in England. Patients were tested for pertussis (oral fluid anti-pertussis toxin IgG) and randomly assigned (1 : 1) to montelukast 10 mg daily or image-matched placebo for 2 weeks. Patients chose whether to continue study drug for another 2 weeks. The randomisation sequence was computer-generated and stratified by general practice. Patients, health-care professionals, and researchers were masked to treatment allocation. Effectiveness was assessed with the Leicester Cough Questionnaire to measure changes in cough-specific quality of life; the primary outcomes were changes in total score between baseline and two follow-up stages (2 weeks and 4 weeks). The primary analysis was by intention to treat with imputation by last observation carried forward. Recruitment closed on Sept 21, 2012, and follow-up has been completed. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2010 - 019647 - 19), UKCRN Portfolio (ID 8360), and ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT 01279668). Findings: From April 13, 2011, to Sept 21, 2012, we randomly assigned 276 patients to montelukast (n= 137) or placebo (n= 139). 70 (25 %) patients had laboratory-confirmed pertussis. Improvements in cough-specific quality of life occurred in both groups after 2 weeks (montelukast: mean 2 · 7, 95 % CI 2 · 2 - 3 · 3; placebo: 3 · 6, 2 · 9 - 4 · 3), but the difference between groups did not meet the minimum clinically important difference of 1 · 3 (mean difference - 0 · 9, - 1 · 7 to - 0 · 04, p= 0 · 04). This difference was not statistically significant in <b>any</b> <b>sensitivity</b> <b>analyses.</b> After 2 weeks, 192 of 259 participants from whom data were available elected to continue study drug (99 [77 %] of 129 participants on montelukast; 93 [72 %] of 130 on placebo). After 4 weeks, there were no significant between-group differences in cough-specific quality of life improvement (montelukast: 5 · 2, 4 · 5 - 5 · 9; placebo: 5 · 9, 5 · 1 - 6 · 7; mean difference - 0 · 5, - 1 · 5 to 0 · 6, p= 0 · 38) or adverse event rates (21 (15 %) of 137 patients on montelukast reported one or more adverse events; 31 (22 %) of 139 on placebo; p= 0 · 14). The most common adverse events reported were increased mucus production (montelukast, n= 6; placebo, n= 2), gastrointestinal disturbance (montelukast, n= 3; placebo, n= 5), and headache (montelukast, n= 2; placebo, n= 6). One serious adverse event was reported (placebo, n= 1), which was unrelated to study drug (shortness of breath and throat tightness after severe coughing bouts). Interpretation: Montelukast is not an effective treatment for postinfectious cough. However, the burden of postinfectious cough in primary care is high, making it an ideal setting for future antitussive treatment trials.

40|$|Knowledge {{elicitation}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} bottlenecks in expert system design. Systems based on Bayes nets require two types of information [...] network structure and parameters (or probabilities). Both must be elicited from the domain expert. In general, parameters have greater opacity than structure, and more time is spent in their refinement than in any other phase of elicitation. Thus, it is important to determine the point of diminishing returns, beyond which further refinements will promise little (if <b>any)</b> improvement. <b>Sensitivity</b> <b>analyses</b> address precisely this issue [...] the sensitivity of a model to the precision of its parameters. In this paper, we report the results of a sensitivity analysis of Pathfinder, a Bayes net based system for diagnosing pathologies of the lymph system.

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{critically}} {{evaluated the}} clinical outcomes and cost characteristics of alternative procedural treatment options for symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An outcomes and cost {{analysis was performed}} for benign prostatic hyperplasia treatments, including photoselective vaporization, microwave thermotherapy, transurethral needle ablation, interstitial laser coagulation and transurethral resection. Clinical outcomes were measured by the percent improvement in American Urological Association/International Prostate Symptom Score, the maximum uroflowmetry rate {{and quality of life}} score. An economic simulation model was constructed to estimate the expected cost of benign prostatic hyperplasia procedural therapies from a payer perspective. The model included costs of initial treatment, followup care, adverse events and re-treatment. <b>Sensitivity</b> and threshold <b>analyses</b> tested the impact of changing model inputs on base case results. RESULTS: Ablative therapies showed better improvement in symptom score, flow rate and quality of life score compared to thermotherapy procedures. Photoselective vaporization resulted in the largest beneficial changes in American Urological Association/International Prostate Symptom Score, the maximum uroflowmetry rate and the quality of life score at all time points evaluated, followed by transurethral resection and then interstitial laser coagulation. The estimated cost was lower for photoselective vaporization than for any other procedural option at <b>any</b> interval studied. <b>Sensitivity</b> <b>analyses</b> indicated that the results of baseline analyses were robust to reasonable changes in clinical and economic inputs to the model.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Sensitivity</b> <b>analyses</b> play {{a crucial}} role in {{assessing}} the robustness of the findings or conclusions based on primary analyses of data in clinical trials.

40|$|Introduction <b>Sensitivity</b> <b>analyses</b> {{refer to}} {{investigations}} {{of the degree to}} which the results of a meta-analysis remain stable when conditions of the data or the analysis change. To the extent that results remain stable, one can refer to them as robust. <b>Sensitivity</b> <b>analyses</b> are rarely conducted in the organizational science literature. Despite conscientiousness being a valued predictor in employment selection, <b>sensitivity</b> <b>analyses</b> have not been conducted with respect to meta-analytic estimates of the correlation (i. e., validity) between conscientiousness and job performance. Methods To address this deficiency, we reanalyzed the largest collection of conscientiousness validity data in the personnel selection literature and conducted a variety of <b>sensitivity</b> <b>analyses.</b> Results Publication bias analyses demonstrated that the validity of conscientiousness is moderately overestimated (by around 30 %; a correlation difference of about. 06). The misestimation of the validity appears to be due primarily to suppression of small effects sizes in the journal literature. These inflated validity estimates result in an overestimate of the dollar utility of personnel selection by millions of dollars and should be of considerable concern for organizations. Conclusion The fields of management and applied psychology seldom conduct <b>sensitivity</b> <b>analyses.</b> Through the use of <b>sensitivity</b> <b>analyses,</b> this paper documents that the existing literature overestimates the validity of conscientiousness in the prediction of job performance.

The aim {{of this study was to}} provide further insight into the relative efficacy of psychological interventions for psychosis. Method: Forty-eight outcome trials comparing psychological interventions for psychosis were identified. The comparisons included 3, 295 participants. Categorization of interventions resulted in six interventions being compared against other interventions pooled. Hedges' g was calculated for all comparisons. Risk of bias was assessed using four items of the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and <b>sensitivity</b> <b>analyses</b> were conducted. Researcher allegiance was assessed, and <b>sensitivity</b> <b>analyses</b> were conducted for robust significant findings. Results: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was significantly more efficacious than other interventions pooled in reducing positive symptoms (g= 0. 16). This finding was robust in all <b>sensitivity</b> <b>analyses</b> for risk of bias but lost significance in <b>sensitivity</b> <b>analyses</b> for researcher allegiance, which suffered from low power. Social skills training was significantly more efficacious in reducing negative symptoms (g= 0. 27).

Aim: To investigate the use of <b>sensitivity</b> <b>analyses</b> in the pharmaceutical cost-utility literature in order to test whether a change in economic parameters could result in a different conclusion regarding the cost effectiveness of the intervention analysed. Methods: Cost-utility analyses of pharmaceuticals identified in a prior comprehensive audit (70 articles) were reviewed and further audited. For each base case for which <b>sensitivity</b> <b>analyses</b> were reported (n = 122), up to two <b>sensitivity</b> <b>analyses</b> for HR-QOL (n = 133), cost (n = 99), and discount rate (n = 128) were examined. Article mentions of thresholds for acceptable cost-utility ratios were recorded (total 36). Cost-utility ratios were denominated in US dollars for the year reported in each of the original articles in order to determine whether a different conclusion would have been indicated at the time the article was published. Quality ratings from the original audit for articles where sensitivity analysis results crossed the cost-utility ratio threshold above the base-case result were compared with those that did not.
