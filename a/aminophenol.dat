40|$|Cryptococcus neoformans {{and other}} Cryptococcus species can produce pigment(s) from many <b>aminophenol</b> and diaminobenzene compounds. Pigment {{production}} from these compounds {{is similar to}} the conversion of diphenols to melanin by C. neoformans. Several pigmentation patterns (resulting in the identification or grouping of Cryptococcus species) have been observed by using diaminobenzene and <b>aminophenol</b> compounds as substrates. The most common pigmentation pattern observed was pigment production by both C. neoformans and C. terreus. In contrast to the diphenols, only two aminophenols (4 -hydroxymetanilamide and 3 -aminotyrosine) were found to be highly specific as substrates. They allowed only C. neoformans to produce pigment. When 4 -aminosalicylic acid was the substrate, a unique pattern was observed because only C. terreus, C. diffluens, and C. albidus produced pigment. Finally, a pattern was observed in which C. neoformans produced large amounts of pigment from <b>aminophenol</b> and diaminobenzene compounds, whereas the other Cryptococcus species produced smaller amounts. A simplified scheme with three substrates resulted in the identification of C. terreus and C. neoformans as well as two groups of other Cryptococcus species, group I (C. albidus and C. diffluens) and group II (C. laurentii and C. luteolus) ...|$|E

40|$|The zinc(II) {{complexes}} {{reported here}} have been synthesised from the ligand 4 -methyl- 2 -N-(2 -pyridylmethyl) <b>aminophenol</b> (Hpyramol) with chloride or acetate counterions. All the five complexes have been structurally characterised, and the crystal structures reveal that the ligand Hpyramol gradually undergoes an oxidative dehydrogenation to form the ligand 4 -methyl- 2 -N-(2 -pyridylmethylene) <b>aminophenol</b> (Hpyrimol), upon coordination to ZnII. All the five complexes cleave the φX 174 phage DNA oxidatively and the complexes with fully dehydrogenated pyrimol ligands {{were found to be}} more efficient than the complexes with non-dehydrogenated Hpyramol ligands. The DNA cleavage is suggested to be ligand-based, whereas the pure ligands alone do not cleave DNA. The DNA cleavage is strongly suggested to be oxidative, possibly due to the involvement of a non-diffusible phenoxyl radical mechanism. The enzymatic religation experiments and DNA cleavage in the presence of different radical scavengers further support the oxidative DNA cleavage by the zinc(II) complexes...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of various factors {{on the material}} yield of the <b>aminophenol</b> from 2 -chloro- 6 -nitrotoluene has been investigated. The most significant increase resulted from efficient agitation best attained by high speed rotat ion of a disk cathode. Under these conditions current efficiency, already high, increased to virtual ly 100 %. The effect of agitation shows that the slowest {{step in the process}} is diffusion controlled. Cathodes of monel and copper were tried. Amalgamation of the surface raised material yield of <b>aminophenol</b> from 21 to 58 per cent with a stat ionary cathode and 37 to 71 per cent with a rotat ing copper cathode. Increase hoth of temperature and of acid strength also raised material yield of <b>aminophenol</b> by an effect, it is believed, on rate of re-arrangement of intermediate hydroxylamine. Increase in the ratio of nitroeompound to acid electrolyte reduced yieht 3 of aminophcnol because of the formation of tarry prod-nets. Yield of amine, the only other simple chemical product, remained constant show-ing that the tarry products resulted by reaction of intermediate hydroxyl~mine with nitroeompound. Current density was increased from 0. 4 to 4 amp/din 2 using a rotat ing cathode without seriously affecting yield. This contrasts trongly with the effeet of a similar change with a stat ionary electrode which causes yield to drop almost by half. Using preferred conditions (20 per cent acid, rotat ing amalgamated monel eathode, 90 ~ 2. 7 amp/dm ~) the following nitroeompounds were reduced to give aminophenols in the material yields indicated: 4 -ehloro- 2 -nitrotoluene (82), o-nitrotoluene (74), o-ehloronitrobenzene (76), 2, 5 ~diehloronitrobenzene (72), and nitrobenzene (72) ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Aminophenols</b> can redox cycle {{through the}} {{corresponding}} quinone imines to generate ROS. The electro-philic quinone imine intermediate can react with protein thiols {{as a mechanism}} of immobilization in vivo. Here, we describe the previously unkown transimination of a quinone imine by lysine as an alternative anchoring mechanism. The redox properties of the condensation product remain largely unchanged because the only structural change to the redox nucleus is the addition of an alkyl substituent to the imine nitrogen. Transimination enables targeting of histone proteins since histones are lysine-rich but nearly devoid of cysteines. Consequently, quinone imines can be embedded in the nucleosome and {{may be expected to}} produce ROS in maximal proximity to the genome. Aniline and its various ring-alkyl congeners are transformedin vivo principally to <b>aminophenols</b> through oxidative metabolism. 1, 2 This pathway is generally considered, at least with respect to carcinogenesis, as one of detoxification, but tha...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study of single and double core ionization potentials of the <b>aminophenol</b> molecule is reported. The role of relaxation, correlation, relativistic, and basis set effects in these potentials is clarified. Special {{attention is paid to}} the isomer dependence of the single and double core ionization potentials. Some of them are also compared with the respective values of the phenol and aniline molecules. It is shown that the core level single ionization potentials of the para-, meta-, and ortho-aminophenol molecules differ only slightly from each other, rendering these structural isomers challenging to distinguish for conventional x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In contrast, the energy needed to remove two core electrons from different atoms depends noticeably on the mutual arrangement and even on the relative orientations of the hydroxyl and amine groups. Together with the electrostatic repulsion between the two core holes, relaxation effects accompanying double core ionization play a crucial role here. The pronounced sensitivity of the double ionization potentials, therefore, enables a spectroscopic characterization of the electronic structure of <b>aminophenol</b> isomers by means of x-ray two-photon photoelectron spectroscopy...|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} an ammonia-sensitive material by coupling the Berthelot reaction to our polymerized crystalline colloidal array (PCCA) technology. The material consists of a periodic array of highly charged colloidal particles (110 nm diameter) embedded in a poly(hydroxyethyl acrylate) hydrogel. The particles have a lattice spacing such that they Bragg-diffract visible light. In the Berthelot reaction, ammonia, hypochlorite, and phenol react to produce the dye molecule indophenol blue in an aqueous solution. We use this reaction in our sensor by covalently attaching 3 -aminophenol to the hydrogel backbone, which forms cross-links through the Berthelot mechanism. Ammonia reacts with hypochlorite, forming monochloramine, which then reacts with a pendant <b>aminophenol</b> to form a benzoquinone chlorimine. The benzoquinone chlorimine reacts with another pendant <b>aminophenol</b> to form a cross-link. The creation of new cross-links causes the hydrogel to shrink, which reduces the lattice spacing of the embedded colloidal array. This volume change results in a blue-shift in the diffracted light proportional to the concentration of NH 3 in the sample. We demonstrate that the NH 3 photonic crystal sensing material is capable of quantitative determination of concentrations in the physiological range (50 - 350 micromol NH 3 L(- 1)) in human blood serum...|$|E

Thus, mixing the <b>aminophenol</b> 3, the dialdehyde 4, and zinc acetate generates the grid complex 1 a(Zn) via the assembly of the ligand 2 a by imine formation and of the grid by zinc(II) binding.
