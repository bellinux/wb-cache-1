40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{automatically}} track an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), with an electronically steered antenna. To {{make it possible to}} track the UAV during flights, a 2. 4 GHz transmitter was mounted on the aircraft. Due to the regulations of transmitted signal power and the fact that a very powerful transmitter would consume to much power, a 10 mW transmitter was used during development. With such a weak transmitter a high gain antenna (a reflector antenna in this case) is required, in the receiver, to detect the transmitted signal at far distances. To be able to detect movement of the UAV, four small Yagi - antennas are mounted around {{the focal point of the}} reflector disc antenna. The received signal strength in the four Yagi-antennas will vary depending on where the transmitter (UAV) is located relative to the tracking device. By comparing the strength of these signals using a microcontroller, the direction of the UAV can be computed and in turn the antenna can be made to track the UAV. To detect the strength of the signals, four Linear Technology® 5534 power detector chips were used. These chips produce a linear DC voltage output corresponding to the received RF signal strength. The DC outputs of the power detectors are connected to the A/D inputs of the microcontroller (in this case a Microchip PIC 16 F 877). The levels are evaluated, and the <b>antenna</b> <b>motors</b> are driven in the necessary direction. A great deal of time was also spent on the mechanical design, as it had to be very strong but also collapsible to fit into a car trunk. All details were drafted in IronCAD® before production in the ECSE mechanical workshop. The project was very successful: test flights were made on distances up to ~ 1 km with good results. With minor adjustments in the power detectors, tracking of the UAV would be possible at even greater distances. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

The distance between the horn antenna and the AUT was set to 1.5 m. Full S-parameter calibration was performed up to the antenna connectors, and the known radiation pattern of the horn antenna was extracted out from the measurement data in post-processing. By summing together all the measured S 21 values of the sub-arrays, we can extract the full array pattern.|$|R

2500|$|Realizing the {{necessity}} of testing and evaluating the B-36 Peacemaker's APG-3 radar tail turret system, Headquarters, United States Air Force, directed the 7th Bomb Wing to undertake testing. The APG-3 was a radar airborne gun sighting system that provided for aircraft detection and automatic fire control of the tail-turret guns, designed to detect and automatically track targets up to 5,000 yards in range on fighter-type aircraft. However, {{it was possible to}} extend that search range temporarily on fighters. After a particular target had been selected by the gunner-radar operator, the system automatically tracked the target within its angular limits in both range and direction. Also, the system automatically directed and pointed the gun turret in the correct firing position. The only mechanical function of the gunner was the activation of the firing mechanism when the target was in effective firing range. One B-36B, 44-92042, of the 26th Bomb Squadron, 11th Bomb Group, was modified for testing as the right gun on the APG-3 was removed and a 35mm Vitarama camera installed in lieu of the turret. The first mission was flown on 25 October 1949, over Eglin AFB Gunnery Range, at [...] Three passes were made on the tail position by two Lockheed F-80 Shooting Stars.

Applications of everyday wireless communication include: cell phones, smart devices/tablets, {{radio frequency identification}} (RFID) tags, medical device location networks, wireless remote electronics, home networks, internet capable home appliances and home electronics. Each application requires a variety of radio frequency hardware to successfully communicate wirelessly. A new and interesting application of wireless communication is implementing a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system with wireless capabilities. The uses for such a HVAC system include: a wireless sensor network (WSN) that can facilitate energy savings operation modes and system status updates, system maintenance requests and updates, remote control of the system, and over the air firmware updates. ^ In this research, a standard HVAC blower motor is provided wireless communications features. Specific challenges of implementing this type of HVAC motor are considered. A standard printed control board (PCB) ultra-high frequency (UHF) F-antenna (FA) is taken and optimized for total gain, and bandwidth. After optimization, the antennas were built and tested using a vector network analyzer (VNA). The test results were then compared to the simulation results to for verification.

40|$|Multiferroics exhibit {{remarkable}} tunabilities {{in their}} ferromagnetic, ferroelectric and magnetoelectric properties {{that provide the}} potential in enabling the control of magnetizations by electric field {{for the next generation}} non-volatile memories, <b>antennas</b> and <b>motors.</b> In recent research and developments in integrating single-phase ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials, multiferroic composite demonstrated a promising magnetoelectric (ME) coupling for future applications. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique, on the other hand, allows fabrications of complex multiferroic nanostructures to investigate interfacial coupling between the two materials. In this work, radical-enhanced ALD of cobalt ferrite (CFO) and thermal ALD of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) were combined in fabricating complex multiferroic architectures in investigating the effect of nanostructuring and magnetic shape anisotropy on improving ME coupling. In particular, 1 D CFO nanotubes and nanowires; 0 D- 3 D CFO/PZT mesoporous composite; and 1 D- 1 D CFO/PZT core-shell nanowire composite were studied. The potential implementation of nanostructured multiferroic composites into functioning devices was assessed by quantifying the converse ME coupling coefficient. The synthesis of 1 D CFO nanostructures was realized by ALD of CFO in anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes. This work provided a simple and inexpensive route to create parallel and high aspect ratio (~ 55) magnetic nanostructures. The change in magnetic easy axis of (partially filled) CFO nanotubes from perpendicular to parallel in (fully-filled) nanowires indicated the significance of the geometric factor in controlling magnetizations and ME coupling. The 0 D- 3 D CFO/PZT mesoporous composite demonstrated the optimizations of the strain transfer could be achieved by precise thickness control. 100 nm of mesoporous PZT was synthesized on Pt/TiOx/SiO 2 /Si using amphiphilic diblock copolymers as a porous ferroelectric template (10 nm pore diameter) for ALD CFO growth. The increased filling of CFO decreased the mechanical flexibility of the composite for electric field induced strain, hence the converse ME coupling was mitigated. The highest converse ME coefficient of 1. 2 10 - 5 Oe-cm/mV was achieved with a 33 % pore filling of CFO, in compare to 1 ï¿½ 10 - 5 Oe-cm/mV from mesoporous CFO filled with 3 nm of PZT in literature (Chien 2016). Highly directional 1 D- 1 D PZT-core CFO-shell composite in AAO demonstrated the magnetic shape anisotropy could be modulated. The CFO shell thickness allowed the tuning of magnetic easy axis and saturation magnetizations; whereas the PZT volume allowed the optimization of electric field induced strain of the composite. Enhanced converse ME coupling of 1. 3 ï¿½ 10 - 4 Oe-cm/mV was realized by 5 nm CFO shell on 30 nm of PZT core. In summary, the work has demonstrated nanostructuring of multiferroic composite is an effective pathway to engineer converse ME coupling through optimizations of magnetic shape anisotropy and interfacial strain transfer...|$|R
40|$|The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is a NASA {{spacecraft}} {{designed to}} study the Sun. It was launched on February 11, 2010 into a geosynchronous orbit, and uses a suite of attitude sensors and actuators to finely point the spacecraft at the Sun. SDO has three science instruments: the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), and the Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE). SDO uses two High Gain Antennas (HGAs) to send science data to a dedicated ground station in White Sands, New Mexico. In {{order to meet the}} science data capture budget, the HGAs must be able to transmit data to the ground for a very large percentage of the time. Each HGA is a dual-axis antenna driven by stepper <b>motors.</b> Both <b>antennas</b> transmit data at all times, but only a single antenna is required {{in order to meet the}} transmission rate requirement. For portions of the year, one antenna or the other has an unobstructed view of the White Sands ground station. During other periods, however, the view from both antennas to the Earth is blocked for different portions of the day. During these times of blockage, the two HGAs take turns pointing to White Sands, with the other antenna pointing out to space. The HGAs handover White Sands transmission responsibilities to the unblocked antenna. There are two handover seasons per year, each lasting about 72 days, where the antennas hand off control every twelve hours. The non-tracking antenna slews back to the ground station by following a ground commanded trajectory and arrives approximately 5 minutes before the formerly tracking antenna slews away to point out into space. The SDO Attitude Control System (ACS) runs at 5 Hz, and the HGA Gimbal Control Electronics (GCE) run at 200 Hz. There are 40 opportunities for the gimbals to step each ACS cycle, with a hardware limitation of no more than one step every three GCE cycles. The ACS calculates the desired gimbal motion for tracking the ground station or for slewing, and sends the command to the GCE at 5 Hz. This command contains the number of gimbals steps for that ACS cycle, the direction of motion, the spacing of the steps, and the delay before taking the first step. The AIA and HMI instruments are sensitive to spacecraft jitter. Pre-flight analysis showed that jitter from the motion of the HGAs was a cause of concern. Three jitter mitigation techniques were developed to overcome the effects of jitter from different sources. The first method is the random step delay, which avoids gimbal steps hitting a cadence on a jitter-critical mode by pseudo-randomly delaying the first gimbal step in an ACS cycle. The second method of jitter mitigation is stagger stepping, which forbids the two antennas from taking steps during the same ACS cycle in order to avoid constructively adding jitter from two antennas. The third method is the inclusion of an instrument No Step Request (NSR), which allows the instruments to request a stoppage in gimbal stepping during the times when they are taking images. During the commissioning phase of the mission, a jitter test was performed onboard the spacecraft. Various sources of jitter, such as the reaction wheels, the High Gain <b>Antenna</b> <b>motors,</b> and the motion of the instrument filter wheels, were examined to determine the level of their effect on the instruments. During the HGA portion of the test, the jitter amplitudes from the single step of a gimbal were examined, as well as the amplitudes due to the execution of various gimbal rates. These jitter levels are compared with the gimbal jitter allocations for each instrument. Additionally, the jitter test provided insight into a readback delay that exists with the GCE. Pre-flight analysis suggested that gimbal steps scheduled to occur during the later portion of an ACS cycle would not be read during that cycle, resulting in a delay in the telemetered current gimbal position. Flight data from the jitter test confirmed this expectation. Analysis is presentehat shows the readback delay does not have a negative impact on gimbal control. The decision was made to consider implementing two of the jitter mitigation techniques on board the spacecraft: stagger stepping and the NSR. Flight data from two sets of handovers, one set without jitter mitigation and the other with mitigation enabled, were examined. The trajectory of the predicted handover was compared with the measured trajectory for the two cases, showing that tracking was not negatively impacted with the addition of the jitter mitigation techniques. Additionally, the individual gimbal steps were examined, and it was confirmed that the stagger stepping and NSRs worked as designed. An Image Quality Test was performed to determine the amount of cumulative jitter from the reaction wheels, HGAs, and instruments during various combinations of typical operations. In this paper, the flight results are examined from a test where the HGAs are following the path of a nominal handover with stagger stepping on and HMI NSRs enabled. In this case, the reaction wheels are moving at low speed and the instruments are taking pictures in their standard sequence. The flight data shows the level of jitter that the instruments see when their shutters are open. The HGA-induced jitter is well within the jitter requirement when the stagger step and NSR mitigation options are enabled. The SDO HGA pointing algorithm was designed to achieve nominal antenna pointing at the ground station, perform slews during handover season, and provide three HGA-induced jitter mitigation options without compromising pointing objectives. During the commissioning phase, flight data sets were collected to verify the HGA pointing algorithm and demonstrate its jitter mitigation capabilities...|$|R
40|$|The Orbiting Low Frequency Antennas for Radio Astronomy (OLFAR) {{project is}} {{investigating}} the feasibility of an orbiting low frequency radio telescope. The radio telescope is formed using a swarm of nano-satellites equipped with astronomical antennas, conceivably orbiting the Moon or the second Lagrange-point of the Earth-Moon system. In these orbits, when at the far-side of the Moon {{as seen from the}} Earth, the low frequency radio signals originating from Earth are deemed to be blocked by the Moon, considerably reducing the amount of interference. Such a telescope, with its unique vantage point, will open up a new field in astronomical research; yet the power demands, as well as the data rates involved are very challenging. This paper details the design of the highly integrated Electric Power System (EPS) of an OLFAR satellite. The most demanding power mode of the mission is during exchange and pre-processing of science data. In this mode, each individual satellite has an average power consumption of 30 W. Similar power demand is expected during the orbit transfer phases, in which the main electric thruster has a duty cycle close to unity, and places additional constraints on the attitude control of the satellite. Such power levels, for extended periods of time, have rarely been shown in such a small form factor. A phased antenna array is used for the downlink, and is constructed from an array of small-patch antennas, in order to achieve sufficient data rates. In an OLFAR satellite, the collection surface of the solar array is shared with this antenna. The tracking mechanism of solar array and <b>antenna</b> uses electric <b>motors,</b> to allow tracking the Sun or the ground station in a three-axis controlled attitude mode. The phased antenna array in turn allows fine pointing when required. The design of the Electric Power System is based on a Maximum Power Point Tracker-fed battery bank, using solar deployable panels. Care is taken {{to reduce the number of}} charge-discharge cycles encountered by the batteries, allowing for an increase in the expected system lifetime. Also the thermal aspects of the power levels involved both in the solar cells, as well as the phased array have been addressed...|$|R
