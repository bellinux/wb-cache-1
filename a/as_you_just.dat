6000|$|... "Listen to me patiently, Lucian, and I {{will try}} to explain the mystery to you, leaving {{the rest of the}} world to {{misunderstand}} me as it pleases. First, you will grant me that even a phoenix must marry some one in order that she may hand on her torch to her children. Her best course would be to marry another phoenix; but as she--poor girl!--cannot appreciate even her own phoenixity, much less that of another, she must perforce be content with a mere mortal. Who is the mortal to be? Not her cousin Lucian; for rising young politicians must have helpful wives, with feminine politics and powers of visiting and entertaining; a description inapplicable to the phoenix. Not, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> now suggested, a man of letters. The phoenix has had her share of playing helpmeet to a man of letters, and does not care to repeat that experience. She is sick to death of the morbid introspection and womanish self-consciousness of poets, novelists, and their like. As to artists, all the good ones are married; and ever since the rest have been able to read in hundreds of books that they are the most gifted and godlike of men, they are become almost as intolerable as their literary flatterers. No, Lucian, the phoenix has paid her debt to literature and art by the toil of her childhood. She will use and enjoy both of them in future as best she can; but she will never again drudge in their laboratories. You say that she might at least have married a gentleman. But the gentlemen she knows are either amateurs of the arts, having the egotism of professional artists without their ability, or they are men of pleasure, which means that they are dancers, tennis-players, butchers, and gamblers. I leave the nonentities out of the question. Now, in the eyes of a phoenix, a prize-fighter is a hero in comparison with a wretch who sets a leash of greyhounds upon a hare. Imagine, now, this poor phoenix meeting with a man who had never been guilty of self-analysis in his life--who complained when he was annoyed, and exulted when he was glad, like a child (and unlike a modern man)--who was honest and brave, strong and beautiful. You open your eyes, Lucian: you do not do justice to Cashel's good looks. He is twenty-five, and yet there is not a line in his face. It is neither thoughtful, nor poetic, nor wearied, nor doubting, nor old, nor self-conscious, as so many of his contemporaries' faces are--as mine perhaps is. The face of a pagan god, assured of eternal youth, and absolutely disqualified from comprehending 'Faust.' Do you understand a word of what I am saying, Lucian?" ...|$|E

40|$|Making {{the most}} from your fruits Cue: We all have our {{favourite}} wild fruit fresh from the tree. The seasons may not last long, {{but there are plenty}} of ways that farmers can preserve and add value to their indigenous tree crops by making delicious jams, jellies and juices for sale. Ismaila Senghore was lucky enough to follow the wild fruits of the Gambia to the factory just outside Banjul, the capital, where they are processed into a range of tasty juices. Gamjuice is the business. Isaac Thomas is the owner. He has been juicing fruits for more than 10 years. Having seen the squeezing, mixing and brightly-labelled bottles - and of course, enjoying a taste or two! Ismaila learns that that juices are not just good to drink. They are also good for the local economy. Can you talk with a processor or trader to find out what they do, and how they keep the fruits in good condition. IN:	?Yes, we have about ten people? OUT:	?not me alone but any juice maker. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 36 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: So when it comes to juices, the message seems to be ?Drink local!? for your own health and that of the local economy. Gambian juicer Isaac Thomas was talking with Ismaila Senghore. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Thomas	We have about ten people on our staff and we have ladies because you know ladies too they are good at mixing and preparing the juice and this juice is like home made, it is not all the chemicals been added to it so they are good in preparing. Although they are trained, but they have their female touches and the like. Senghore	You are not only producing for the local market but also for the international consumer market. Thomas	Yes that is what we are doing. We are exporting, although a bit small, but we are exporting to our neighbour countries. Senghore	Can you estimate the number of bottles that you export or consume locally here? Thomas	I can say it is a small production factory and it is home made so we take our time. Senghore	In other words they would be happy just to have a taster of what Gambian juice is like? These are the people you target? Thomas	Those people that would admire our juice: hotels and restaurants. Senghore	We see that you have a variety of juices that you make. Now can you itemise them? Thomas	Yes we do all the local juices in the Gambia like Baobab juice, we do ginger, we do tamarind, and we do mango. So all our juices are foods that are available in the Gambia. And available in large quantities ? you just go to the market. And that will help the farmers. We are showing Gambians or showing the world that we can too, we can aim to do our own bottling, everything that has been produced and preserving it. Senghore	Now as your name implies GAMJUICE, you are into the promotion of locally produced juices, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> mentioned, by processing the raw materials to add value to them. How do you collect the baobab fruit? Thomas	The baobab fruit, we just go to the market, and sometimes the villages will bring and sell it to us so we just buy it from them. Senghore	Let us now come to the production of baobab juice. If you really want to go into baobab juice as you do it here, how do you start and how do you end. What do you do step by step to get the product that you require? Thomas	Although there are some secrets in it but you have to extract the juice and you have to soak it, leave it for a while so that the fruit will be separated from the seed. And then you have to process it, heat it, so that the germs are eradicated and the like. Senghore	To pasteurise it. When you get the pasteurised juice what do you add to it? Do you add anything to flavour it, sugar? Thomas	No we just add sugar only because these are natural juice, they all have the flavours and the colour. It is more healthy than adding all these flavours and the like. Senghore	You may also want to have labels on it for marketing purpose and so forth. Make it attractive for the market. Thomas	Yes we do have that, we do have expiry dates which you can see on the labels. Senghore	To start such a business, expense, that go into it, would it be very capital intensive? Thomas	Yes it is a bit capital intensive. I started long years ago. I started as a small scale and now I am not in the large scale but in the medium scale. Bottles, the capping machine, they are expensive, labels are. So you need small capital. Senghore	What about individuals who may want to go into such a venture. Would it be easy for them and what kind of capital would you for-see? Thomas	The individual can go in for it. The only thing is that you know then you have to buy a lot of other machineries to enable you to do that. People should keep drinking local, healthy juices. They prevent you from a lot of diseases. It is natural, so it prevents you, it is a fact. So when you drink it you are healthier. Senghore	Well I have just tasted your juice, the carbonated one and it tasted really, really nice, maybe you would want to tell people to also consume our local made products because it is a way of getting our independence from the multi-laterals that dominate the market ? isn?t it? Thomas	Yes definitely I think that people should consume our local products. Because number one, it will help farmers over there so they are able to sell their products. And that will add to their health also. It is not like buying it but it is adding to your health. So that is what I would encourage the Gambians to go in and definitely patronise us the juice makers ? not me alone but any juice maker. End of track.

40|$|Reducing {{risks for}} people and poultry Cue: Each year, the coming of winter in the Northern Hemisphere causes {{millions}} of birds to fly south, searching for warmer weather. Many end up in Africa, often settling in wetland areas. For African countries this also brings potential danger. The H 5 N 1 strain of avian flu has been detected in several European and Asian countries, and could potentially be brought to Africa by migrating birds, such as ducks and geese. For commercial poultry farmers and small scale village farmers, an outbreak of avian flu could be devastating; a serious outbreak could also have significant impact on national economies for some countries. In 2006, Senegal {{was one of several}} African countries where an outbreak of H 5 N 1 avian flu occurred. This is the type of flu that can also be spread to humans, and has led to over one hundred human deaths in East Asia. The small country of The Gambia is surrounded by Senegal on three sides. So far it has remained free of the virus, but the government has set up rapid response teams in 6 zones of the country, to deal with an outbreak should one occur. So what should farmers be doing, both to minimise the risks to their poultry and to themselves? In this interview, Dr Demba Jallow, head of the national avian flu response team, offers some advice. Putting the questions was Ismaila Senghore. IN:		?One, try to be observing your birds?? OUT:		??marginalised and the poorest therefore. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 07 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Ismaila Senghore was speaking to Dr Demba Jallow, Assistant Director of Livestock Services for The Gambia, and head of the national avian flu rapid response team. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Jallow	One, try to be observing your birds everyday to observe any mortalities or sickness and other things. That?s one. And report immediately to the nearest veterinary personnel in case you notice some mortalities or some sickness in your birds, that?s one. Two, dead birds should be buried deep or burned. They should not be eaten, and any poultry products should be well cooked. Never eat sick birds. And then three you should always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, to kill the virus. So that is some of the advice we always give to our farmers. Senghore	Now Dr Jallow, we understand that the most infectious part of the poultry is the droppings, poultry droppings. Now this can be in the poultry yard or it can be in transportation vehicles, or receptacles where these flocks may be put. What do you advise people to do {{to make sure that they}} are not easily in contact with droppings which might be infected? Jallow	We have always told our farmers, any time you visit your poultry, wash your hands properly, and then every time you visit the poultry, always remove all your clothes and wash them, of course your shoes and all those things. And three, when it comes to droppings, droppings should be well cleaned and then packed in one area of the farm, preferably dried and then buried. Because the virus lives best in dung which is very moist. So we always discourage moisture being in the dung. Senghore	But I?m sure in some places they will recommend cleaning of all utensils and so forth, but there are areas where there might not be enough water. I?m sure fortunately here in The Gambia we seem to have adequate water. But just in areas in African countries who are also just as concerned as we are, where there is no water, what do you recommend for them to do? Jallow	Now that will be very difficult. In The Gambia <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> stated, we have a lot of water. But in areas where perhaps water is scarce, perhaps they have to dry the equipment or their clothing in air, in the hope that the hot sun will sterilise this equipment. Senghore	Now when you come to generally the hazards, what are the main possibilities for the virus to transfer from birds to humans? Jallow	From birds to humans. Of course it is very high, especially where there is no hygiene, or where there is ignorance of the mode of transmission of the disease. That is why we always advise that you should maintain hygiene at all levels. That?s why when you?re cooking meat, poultry meat, etc. and when you are dealing with poultry, your poultry house should be far away from where you live. It should be well cleaned daily, and you should always put on a mask when you are cleaning the dung and all those things, and you should always wash your hands thereafter, and of course always cook your meat or eggs thoroughly. And then of course, at a commercial level, we advise farmers to maintain biosecurity so that at least they is least movement between birds from their farm to an outside farm, that?s one, or birds within their farm and these other migratory birds that come to seek for feed and other things. So hygiene is the key word in the effort to prevent poultry to human transmission. Senghore	And I?m sure you also want to have a say on regional movements, because there could be cross border movement of animals from other countries into our country. Jallow	Exactly, just as migratory birds don?t have boundaries, they move from Europe to here, they can get to our neighbouring country like Senegal and then still move to our wetlands here, without warning or so. So it is always very important, that?s why you have to have regional networking with our neighbours. That we have already established with Senegal, so that we can be sharing information in terms of movements and all those things. Senghore	But what about live birds, I mean poultry? Jallow	Live birds, this concerns the fact that our borders are very porous and we have these weekly markets, where people across the border trade in live poultry. So this is a major source of concern. But again, just as I have told you, we have sensitised our people sufficiently enough, to be able to at least hopefully be responsible for their own well-being, or the well-being of their animals in case there is an outbreak, or even before there is an outbreak. Maintain hygiene, don?t buy sick birds, don?t carry sick birds to your home, always isolate them or quarantine them for at least two weeks before you introduce them into the flock, don?t accept birds which are gifts and other things, especially when you think they are sick, and other things. Things like that we have well informed our people, and we hope that they will abide by such things and then minimise the risk of bird to human transmission. Senghore	Do you think it is important to have a clause that for example prohibits the introduction of infected poultry into particular areas, and if anyone contravenes it, for example. Jallow	This is in the Animal Disease Act of this country, that in the case of an outbreak, or the case of transboundary diseases, nobody is allowed by law to trade in such animals or birds. So anybody who is found doing such a thing can land himself in prison also. Senghore	Now to conclude, what is the overall threat of bird flu to a small economy like The Gambia? Jallow	It may be devastating, because up to about 80 per cent of our population are the farming community and most of them keep poultry, and these poultry help them in the solving of their small problems on a daily basis. So where poultry are wiped out then their livelihoods are destroyed and then that means that they have to go back to zero again and start from scratch. So it is actually a big threat. It can destroy a whole economy, concerning the fact that the affected people will the most marginalised and the poorest therefore. End of track.
