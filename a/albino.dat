5|$|Several {{types of}} {{aquarium}} fish are called <b>albino,</b> e.g. <b>albino</b> driftwood catfish, <b>albino</b> festivium, <b>albino</b> red tailed shark and <b>albino</b> tiger shark, however, photographs {{of these four}} fish indicate that the latter three have dark eyes and/or pigmented fins.|$|E

25|$|Some <b>albinos</b> in Tanzania {{have been}} the victims of {{violence}} in recent years. Attacks are often to hack off the limbs of <b>albinos</b> in the perverse superstitious belief that possessing the bones of <b>albinos</b> will bring wealth. The country has banned witch doctors {{to try to prevent}} the practice, but it has continued and <b>albinos</b> remain targets.|$|R
25|$|<b>Albinos</b> often face {{social and}} {{cultural}} challenges (even threats), as the condition is often a source of ridicule, racism, fear, and violence. Many cultures {{around the world have}} developed beliefs regarding people with albinism. <b>Albinos</b> are persecuted in Tanzania by witchdoctors, who use the body parts of <b>albinos</b> as ingredients in rituals and potions, as they are thought to possess magical power.|$|R
25|$|In Tanzania in 2008, President Kikwete {{publicly}} condemned witchdoctors {{for killing}} <b>albinos</b> for their body parts, which {{are thought to}} bring good luck. 25 <b>albinos</b> have been murdered since March 2007. In Tanzania, <b>albinos</b> are often murdered for their body parts {{on the advice of}} witch doctors in order to produce powerful amulets that are believed to protect against witchcraft and make the owner prosper in life.|$|R
5|$|There {{are several}} reports of <b>albino</b> {{lampreys}} {{and it has}} been estimated that this occurs at a frequency of one in 100,000 normal individuals.|$|E

5|$|Whilst {{en route}} to the Albino's hideout, the four plan their attack. Kang {{suggests}} an aggressive frontal assault, which the Klingons agree to. Jadzia confronts him afterwards and finds out that he had already been in contact with the <b>Albino</b> who offered him a glorious death at the hands of forty of his best men, and Kang accepted as he believes the Albino's defences are impenetrable. Dax creates an alternative plan to disable all energy weapons in the Albino's base, requiring them to use hand-to-hand combat only. Kang agrees to the new plan. They transport to the surface and find that the <b>Albino</b> attempted to booby trap the main gate to kill Kang and the others before a fight started. The four move through the compound and confront the <b>Albino</b> in his chambers. During the fight, Koloth is killed and Kang is mortally wounded. Jadzia disarms the <b>Albino</b> and allows Kang to kill him, before he dies himself. Kor and Jadzia leave the compound as the Klingon sings a song to his fallen comrades.|$|E
40|$|The study {{investigates the}} social {{stratification}} of <b>albinos</b> in Tanzania. This {{is done by}} conducting {{a case study in}} Babati and decoding and generalising the attitudes in a national context. This is combined with a litterateur study which has been made analysing the attitudes towards <b>albinos</b> in the media. The study has used a critical as well as continental discourse analysis and decoded the data by using the theories of social constructivism and of stigma. Semi-structured interviews as well as a litterateur study was conducted. The result proved that the <b>albinos</b> in Tanzania are stigmatised in the society and that people treat them based on myths and preconceptions. This stratification sometimes goes as far as to murders and mutations of <b>albinos.</b> The respondents as well as the media and government refer to the lack of education as the main cause behind the killings of <b>albinos.</b> A combination of the myths about <b>albinos</b> and the lack of education is the reasons that are accurate when analysing the reasons behind the ongoing murders. ...|$|R

5|$|A {{study on}} albinistic prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) found that {{albinism}} in this species conferred an {{advantage for the}} males compared to the wild-type; <b>albino</b> males had higher mount frequencies than wild-type males. In addition, the albinos had greater differential fertilizing capacity.|$|E
5|$|Extremely rare <b>albino</b> individuals, {{sometimes}} called white panthers, also occur among jaguars, {{as with the}} other big cats. As usual with albinos in the wild, selection keeps the frequency close to the rate of mutation.|$|E

5|$|Some American {{alligators}} {{are missing}} an inhibited gene for melanin, {{which makes them}} <b>albino.</b> These American alligators are extremely rare and almost impossible {{to find in the}} wild.

5|$|The {{mountains}} around Mont Blanc {{are home}} to many mammal species, including ibex, chamois, deer, mountain hare and alpine marmot (including a small population of <b>albino</b> marmots within Val Ferret). Eurasian lynx have been reintroduced into the French Alps and, although present around the Mont Blanc massif, are extremely unlikely to be encountered.|$|E

5|$|A leucistic Coragyps atratus brasiliensis was {{observed}} in Piñas, Ecuador in 2005. It had white plumage overall, with only the tarsus and tail {{as well as some}} undertail feathers being black. It was not an <b>albino</b> as its skin seemed to have had the normal, dark color and {{it was part of a}} flock of some twenty normally plumaged individuals.|$|E
5|$|However, other taxonomists {{challenged}} {{the validity of}} the species as early as 1939, noting that the Lānai hookbill was only known from one specimen and arguing that it was merely an aberrant and partially <b>albino</b> female ōū. The hookbill's validity was not confirmed until 1989 when the specimen's skull was removed and examined. The bird's cranial osteology, myology, plumage, and bill morphology confirmed the distinctness of the species.|$|E

5|$|The {{proportion}} {{of people living}} under poverty line was 60.5 per cent in 2010 compared to 62.8 per cent in 2006 as per the Living Condition Monitoring Survey (LCMS). The extremely poor formed 42.3 per cent {{of the total population}} as against 42.7 per cent in 2007. Around two per cent of the population was disabled, 35 per cent of which is accounted to diseases. Out of the disabled, 90.2 per cent were employed and the literacy rate of the disabled population remained at 58.6 per cent compared to the general literacy rate of 70.2 per cent. Albinism is a condition where people have little or no pigment in their eyes, skin or hair. As per the census, there were 25,324 <b>albino</b> people in the country with 12,532 males (49.48%) and 12,792 females (50.52%). The literacy rate of <b>albino</b> population was 66.1 per cent.|$|E
5|$|Understanding {{the changes}} that have {{occurred}} during an organism's evolution can reveal the genes needed to construct parts of the body, genes which may be involved in human genetic disorders. For example, the Mexican tetra is an <b>albino</b> cavefish that lost its eyesight during evolution. Breeding together different populations of this blind fish produced some offspring with functional eyes, since different mutations had occurred in the isolated populations that had evolved in different caves. This helped identify genes required for vision and pigmentation.|$|E
