During the next eight months, ATA-176 operated between ports in New Guinea, Emirau, Morotai, Borneo, and various Philippine islands. On 20 October 1945, the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>tug</b> stood out of Manila {{to search for a}} U.S. Army barge that had been reported adrift to the northwest. She found the barge on the 26th and towed it to Okinawa. ATA-176 then returned to Manila Bay on 5 November 1945. After operations in the Philippines, she called at Guam in April 1946 and left Apra Harbor on 2 May towing [...] to Midway Island. She delivered her charge there on the 15th and headed for the United States.

On that day, ATA-176 was decommissioned and placed [...] "in service," [...] manned by a civilian crew. On 16 July 1948, the ship was given the name Tonkawa, becoming the first U.S. Navy vessels named after the Tonkawa.|$|E
5000|$|The tug was {{transferred}} to the Coast Guard and was commissioned under the command of LT Clarence J. Pare, Jr., as the <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Tug</b> USCGC Modoc (WATA-194) on 20 April 1959, named in honor of the Modoc Indians. She then reported to her home port of Coos Bay, Oregon, where she replaced the aging 125-foot cutter USCGC Bonham (WSC-129). Bonham crew had cross-decked to Modoc and a rumor from the time was that her commissioning had been ordered so quickly that there had not been sufficient time to paint over her entire Navy gray hull and only the shore-side of Modoc was painted white. From 1959 to 1969 she was stationed at Coos Bay, Oregon where she was used for coastal and off-shore search and rescue, oceanography, and law enforcement duties, primarily fisheries enforcement. Her normal area of operations extended from the California-Oregon border to Canada and she was also occasionally called upon to patrol the Gulf of Alaska. When not underway, Modoc was on continual alert and was capable of getting underway within two hours to proceed to a vessel in distress. A unit history written by an anonymous crewman sometime in the mid-1970s noted: [...] "Designed and built from the keel up along the lines of a classic European oceangoing tug, the MODOC will literally tow anything afloat. She is fully equipped to carry out major coastal and long-range search and rescue operations, one of her two major mission areas. MODOCs other prime mission is law enforcement. This cutter, along with other west coast cutters, patrols the waters off Oregon, Washington, and California, locating and identifying foreign fishing vessels. In addition, the operations and catch of these vessels are monitored and the vessels frequently boarded. Foreign vessels found in violation of our national fisheries laws within 12 miles km would be brought into port and prosecuted in federal court. As you read this, the MODOC is on fisheries patrol performing this duty." ...|$|E
