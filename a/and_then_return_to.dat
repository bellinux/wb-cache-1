5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to settle in France, he moved to Britain {{and then to the}} capital of present-day Belgium, Brussels, where he settled. He {{intended}} to live there until Mercedes completed her education <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Argentina. Rivadavia visited Brussels and San Martín intended to challenge him to a duel, but was dissuaded by Diego Paroissien.|$|E
5|$|The RN's Operational Intelligence Centre {{selected}} the route and timing for the raid based on intelligence about {{the location of}} minefields and German recognition signals sourced from Enigma decryptions and knowledge of Luftwaffe patrols compiled by the Air Ministry's Air Intelligence Branch. When all the plans had been pulled together and the timing worked out, the raid was expected to last no longer than two hours. The commandos and crew from Campbeltown would board the motor launches at the Old Mole jetty <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> base.|$|E
5|$|In 1896 Synge visited Italy {{to study}} the {{language}} for a time before returning to Paris. Later that year he met W. B. Yeats, who encouraged him to live {{for a while in}} the Aran Islands, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Dublin and devote himself to creative work. That year he joined with Yeats, Augusta, Lady Gregory, and George William Russell to form the Irish National Theatre Society, which later established the Abbey Theatre. He also wrote some pieces of literary criticism for Gonne's Irlande Libre and other journals, as well as unpublished poems and prose in a decadent fin de siècle style. (These writings were eventually gathered in the 1960s for his Collected Works.) He also attended lectures at the Sorbonne by the noted Celtic scholar Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville.|$|E

5|$|The Invasion of Guadeloupe was a British amphibious {{operation}} fought between 28 January and 6 February 1810 {{over control of}} the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe during the Napoleonic Wars. The island was the final remaining French colony in the Americas, following the systematic invasion and capture of the others during 1809 by British forces. During the Napoleonic Wars, the French colonies had provided protected harbours for French privateers and warships, which could prey on the numerous British trade routes in the Caribbean <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the colonies before British warships could react. In response, the British instituted a blockade of the islands, stationing ships off every port and seizing any vessel that tried to enter or leave. With trade and communication made dangerous by the British blockade squadrons, the economies and morale of the French colonies began to collapse, and in the summer of 1808 desperate messages were sent to France requesting helping.|$|E
5|$|Under Canadian law, miners {{first had}} to get a license, either when they arrived at Dawson or en route from Victoria in Canada. They could then {{prospect}} for gold and, when they had found a suitable location, lay claim to mining rights over it. To stake a claim, a prospector would drive stakes into the ground a measured distance apart <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Dawson to register the claim for $15 ($410). This normally had to be done within three days, and by 1897 only one claim per person at a time was allowed in a district, although married couples could exploit a loophole that allowed the wife to register a claim in her own name, doubling their amount of land.|$|E
5|$|Lisa imagines she and all {{the other}} Springfield Elementary {{students}} are Hebrews in ancient Egypt, with the Pharaoh (Principal Skinner) making them build a pyramid. Only Moses (Milhouse) can liberate the Hebrews. When Bart defaces the Pharaoh's sarcophagus, supposedly incited by the burning bush, he gets the other students punished. Lisa helps Milhouse produce plagues to scare the Pharaoh into freeing the Israelites; they fail. This in turn gets Lisa and Milhouse thrown in a Pyramid prison. When they escape, Milhouse gathers all the students and they attempt to leave. When they reach the sea, Lisa has an idea to get across: They simultaneously flush all the Egyptians' toilets to drain the sea. As they cross, the Pharaoh and his guards follow, but the water fills the sea back up and swallows them. They enjoy splashing each other, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the shore. Pleased that they have escaped, Milhouse asks Lisa what the future holds for the Israelites, but Lisa disappoints Milhouse when she says that they have to wander the desert for forty years. Milhouse then asks if {{it is going to be}} smooth sailing for the Jews after that. Rather than disappoint Milhouse again with news of the ongoing anti-Semitism that will plague the Jews for many centuries, she distracts the crowd by sending them to search for manna.|$|E

25|$|The {{underground}} station at Waterloo was {{located within the}} existing transverse arches of the main line station, with the arrival and departure platforms in separate arches, and a staircase access. Siding accommodation and a reversing siding were provided beyond the platforms: after disembarkation of passengers, an arriving train would continue forward to the reversing sidings, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the departure platform. An additional lay-by siding was provided later.|$|E
25|$|Holidays {{celebrating the}} arrival of the Magi {{traditionally}} recognise a distinction between the date of their arrival and the date of Jesus' birth. The account given in the Gospel of Matthew does not state that they were present {{on the night of the}} birth; in the Gospel of Luke, Joseph and Mary remain in Bethlehem until it is time for Jesus' dedication, in Jerusalem, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> their home in Nazareth.|$|E

25|$|For {{the last}} few months of his life Leigh Fermor {{suffered}} from a cancerous tumour, and in early June 2011 he underwent a tracheotomy in Greece. As death was close, according to local Greek friends, he expressed a wish to visit England to say good-bye to his friends, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> die in Kardamyli, though it is also stated that he actually wished to die in England and be buried next to his wife.|$|E
25|$|Christian next {{attempted}} to interest {{the great powers}} in Norway's cause, but without success. On being pressed by the commissioners of the allied powers {{to bring about a}} union between Norway and Sweden in accordance with the terms of the treaty of Kiel, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Denmark, he replied that, as a constitutional king, he could do nothing without the consent of the parliament (Storting), which would not be convoked until there was a suspension of hostilities on the part of Sweden.|$|E
25|$|The {{rules of}} the IIHF, NHL and Hockey Canada do not permit goaltenders to be {{designated}} as on-ice captains, because of the logistical challenge of having the goaltender relay rules discussions between referees and coaches <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the crease. (The Vancouver Canucks named goaltender Roberto Luongo as their captain during the 2008–09 and 2009–10 seasons, but due to NHL rules, he did not serve as the official on-ice captain.) In the NCAA, there is no position-based restriction on the team captain.|$|E

25|$|He was {{selected}} to tour with the England team visiting Australia in 1881/2, playing four Tests, and then in 1882/3 Midwinter emigrated back to Australia, joining Victoria. He {{was selected}} for Australia to play the one-off Test after England had won the first Ashes series in 1883/4, and then for the Australian tour of England in 1884. This makes him the only man to play Test cricket for one international side, then another, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> his original international team.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the mid 20th century, upon {{graduation}} Australian doctors {{spent time}} in general practice. A medical career usually included completing an intern year immediately after graduation as a resident in a major teaching hospital. After {{a period of time}} in general practice, some doctors would seek specialist qualifications. Possibly reflecting the historical origins of Australia as a series of British colonies, these doctors would travel overseas, most often to the UK, to specialise <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> establish practice.|$|E
25|$|In all of this, the {{flagship}} of Don Fadrique had entirely managed {{to pass through}} the enemy formation, and turning back toward the convoy, he decided to launch his ship against two other Dutch naos, and soon sent down and pay one of them, while the second could ignite. But the fire soon spread to his own ship and he ordered to turn it off <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the battle approaching his ships by the weather side, again not to fear the spread.|$|E

25|$|Costa Rica hosts many refugees, {{mainly from}} Colombia and Nicaragua. As {{a result of}} that and illegal immigration, an {{estimated}} 10–15% (400,000–600,000) of the Costa Rican population is made up of Nicaraguans. Some Nicaraguans migrate for seasonal work opportunities <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> their country. Costa Rica took in many refugees from a range of other Latin American countries fleeing civil wars and dictatorships during the 1970s and 1980s, notably from Chile and Argentina, as well as people from El Salvador who fled from guerrillas and government death squads.|$|E
25|$|The first {{recorded}} ethnic Greeks in Houston, {{listed in the}} Houston City Directory of 1889-1890, were George and Peter Poleminacos. They worked as manual laborers, as they did not speak English. Kalliope Vlahos was the first Greek woman to arrive, in 1903; after her, more women and families with children began settling Houston. Many of the earliest settlers planned {{to make money in}} the U.S. <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> their homelands. Several Greeks became businessowners; historically many Greeks operated cafes and sweets shops in Downtown Houston. The capital start-up costs of such shops were relatively low.|$|E
25|$|In 1908, {{two decades}} after its construction, the Sunday school wing was doubled in size. In {{accordance}} with the Akron Plan developed by Lewis Miller and other influential religious educational theorists of the day, it also was reconfigured into {{the form of a}} two-story rotunda with classrooms surrounding the central space on both levels, to provide for a graded Sunday school where children could study the same Biblical lesson as their parents, but in a manner more appropriate to their developmental level, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> discuss it as a group. This was an increasingly common design or redesign for American Protestant churches of the era.|$|E
