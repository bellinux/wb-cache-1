We provide an intuitive explanation for this behavior assuming independent individual transitions between pairs of states. In contrast, the probability of survival in the ground state at long time shows a novel, non-monotonic, functional form, with an oscillatory behavior in the sweep rate at low sweep rate values.

40|$|When the {{dynamics}} is constrained by adiabatic invariance, a reactive {{process can be}} described as a one-dimensional motion along the reaction coordinate in an effective potential. This simplification is often valid for central potentials and for the curved harmonic valley studied in the reaction path Hamiltonian model. For an ionolecule reaction, the action integral = (1 / 2 π) {clockwise contour integral}P θdθ is an adiabatic invariant. The Poisson bracket of 2 with Hamiltonians corresponding to a great variety of long-range electrostatic interactions is found to decrease with the separation coordinate r, faster than the corresponding potential. This indicates that the validity of the adiabatic approximation is not directly related to the shape of the potential energy surface. The leading role played by the translational momentum is accounted for by Jacobi's form of the least action principle. However, although the identification of <b>adiabatic</b> <b>regions</b> by this procedure is limited to a specific range of coordinate configurations, equivalent constraints must persist all along the reaction coordinate and must operate during the entire reaction, as a result of entropy conservation.

A totally different scenario with respect to the original single-particle Landau-Zener scheme is found for ground-state sweeps, in which a breakdown of the <b>adiabatic</b> <b>region</b> emerges as the sweep rate decreases. On the contrary, the transfer efficiency across inverse sweeps reveals consistent results with the single-particle Landau-Zener predictions.

The generation of region 0 /region 1 FACs observed near the poleward edge of the auroral oval is {{closely associated with the}} dynamics of ion beams produced by nonadiabatic acceleration in the tail current sheet. After ejection from the current sheet, ion beams advance toward the Earth along the nearly straight field lines. During such a time interval, the ions have insignificant magnetic drift velocities. Subsequently, they are reflected at low-altitude mirror points, and under the influence of inward convection they pass the equator on magnetic shells that are further in. At that moment they attain large magnetic (curvature) drift velocities. Accordingly, in a steady state, the magnetic drift speed averaged over all the ions in a flux tube increases with decreasing invariant latitude; it starts to increase significantly at a certain magnetic shell. In the present paper this magnetic shell is identified with the interface demarcating the nonadiabatic and <b>adiabatic</b> <b>regions</b> in the tail current sheet. An essential point for the region 1 FAC generation is distortion of this interface, namely inclination of the interface to the direction of the average magnetic drift velocity. The generation of region 0 FACs is due to anomalous cross-field diffusion of energized ions near the poleward edge of the auroral oval.

To carry out the proposed study, an engine simulation model was used. The simulation determines engine performance and NO emissions as functions of engine operating conditions, engine design parameters, and combustion parameters. An automotive, spark-ignition engine at part load and 1400 rpm was examined in this study. The engine cycle simulation employed three zones for the combustion process: (1) unburned gas, (2) <b>adiabatic</b> core <b>region,</b> and (3) boundary-layer gas. The use of the <b>adiabatic</b> core <b>region</b> {{has been shown to be}} especially necessary to capture the production of nitric oxides which are highly temperature dependent.

Furthermore, literature has shown that variations of these three input parameters may be approximated by a normal frequency distribution. Using the mean and standard deviation, and a random number generator, input values were tabulated for the ignition delay, burn duration and equivalence ratio. These three input parameters were then used to simulate cyclic variations in the combustion process. Calculated results show that cyclic variations of the input parameters cause the cycle-by-cycle NO emissions to increase and decrease by as much as 59 % from the mean cycle NO of 3, 247 ppm. The average NO emission resulting from ccv was 4. 9 % less than the mean cycle NO emission.
