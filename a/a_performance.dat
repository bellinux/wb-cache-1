40|$|Extensive {{research}} has been conducted on the leadership skills that are required to improve <b>a</b> team’s <b>performance.</b> However, theories have not managed to explain conclusively how certain leadership skills are able to improve <b>a</b> team's <b>performance</b> over others. Recent studies, have shifted the focus from trying to single out leadership skills that improve <b>a</b> team’s <b>performance</b> to identifying categories of skills - like ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ skills - that improve <b>a</b> team's <b>performance.</b> This study develops and explains how the categories of meta skills and technical skills provide a more comprehensive explanation of leadership skills than the categories of ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ skills. This study explores the relationship between a leader’s meta skills and technical skills on <b>a</b> team’s <b>performance.</b> <b>A</b> case study method within an interpretive paradigm was used to assess the way in which meta and technical skills were perceived to improve <b>a</b> team’s <b>performance.</b> The study drew from the rich insights of leaders and team members within four programmes located in the Graduate School of Public and Development Management. Open-ended and closed-ended questionnaires and semi-structured interviews gathered data to assess the perceived skills required in an ideal leader to improve team performance. The study revealed that <b>a</b> team’s <b>performance</b> improves when <b>a</b> leader emphasises the exercise of meta skills above the exercise of technical skills. However, an over-emphasis of either meta skills or technical skills results in the demoralisation of a team which eventually leads to the reduction of <b>a</b> team’s <b>performance.</b> The notion of meta skills and technical skills should therefore not be regarded as discrete factors that impact on <b>a</b> team’s <b>performance</b> in <b>a</b> linear causeeffect relationship. Instead, <b>a</b> team’s <b>performance</b> is affected by the interaction of factors within the individual, organisational and global context, {{as well as by the}} exercise of meta and technical skills in a dynamic and inter-connected process...|$|R
