50|$|Data {{acquisition}} hardware for {{acoustic measurements}} typically utilizes 24-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), anti-aliasing filters, and other signal conditioning. This signal conditioning may include amplification, filtering, sensor excitation, and input configuration. Another consideration is the frequency {{range of the}} instrumentation. It should {{be large enough to}} cover the frequency range of signal interest, taking into account the range of the sensor. To prevent aliasing, many devices come with antialiasing filters, which cut the maximum frequency range of the device to a little less than one-half the maximum sampling rate, as prescribed by the Nyquist sampling theorem. Dynamic range is a common way to compare performance from one instrument to another. Dynamic range is a measure of how small you can measure a signal relative to the maximum input signal the device can measure. Expressed in decibels, the dynamic range is 20 log (Vmax/Vmin). For example, a device with an input range of ±10 V and a dynamic range of 110 dB will be able to measure a signal as small as 10 µV. Thus, the input range and the specified dynamic range are important for determining the needs of your instrumentation system.
