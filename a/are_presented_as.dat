5|$|Aradia is {{composed}} of fifteen chapters, the first ten of which <b>are</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> being Leland's translation of the Vangelo manuscript {{given to him by}} Maddalena. This section, while predominantly made up of spells and rituals, is also the source of most of the myths and folktales contained in the text. At the end of Chapter I is the text in which Aradia gives instructions to her followers on how to practice witchcraft.|$|E
5|$|As is customary, the men's {{marathon}} medals (at the Summer Olympics) or the men's 50km and woman´s 30km {{cross-country skiing}} medals (at the Winter Olympics) <b>are</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> {{part of the}} Closing Ceremony, which {{take place on the}} penultimate and the last days, in the Olympic Stadium, and are thus the last medal presentation of the Games.|$|E
5|$|Metal corsets {{are found}} {{in a number of}} museum {{collections}} around the world. Some museums, including the Museo Stibbert, and the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, present their metal bodices as fashionable late 16th-century garments. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London describes their iron corset (formerly owned by the painter Talbot Hughes) as dating from the 18th century and likely intended for orthopaedic purposes. Others, such as the iron corset in the Fashion Institute of Technology, <b>are</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> fakes.|$|E
30|$|Continuous {{variables}} <b>were</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> median and {{interquartile range}} (median [IQR]). Binary and categorical variables <b>were</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> frequencies and percentages [n (%)].|$|R
50|$|Unlike nuclear DNA, which <b>is</b> <b>present</b> <b>as</b> linear {{molecules}} {{inside the}} chromosomes, organellar DNA <b>is</b> <b>present</b> <b>as</b> circular molecules of high copy number.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes the {{transformation}} from value to production price <b>is</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> a logical development, {{at other times}} the production price <b>is</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> an irrational expression.|$|R
5|$|Though the {{pamphlet}} describes the pitiable and desperate {{conditions in which}} prostitutes lived, and {{the corruption of the}} police supposed to be patrol them, it also accuses prostitutes of 'Inhumanity' and deems them devilish and monstrous. The vices of the prostitute <b>are</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> those endemic among all women.|$|E
5|$|As {{a medieval}} Christian author William could hardly avoid hostility towards the kingdom's Muslim neighbours, {{but as an}} educated man who lived among Muslims in the east, he was rarely polemical or {{completely}} dismissive of Islam. He did not think Muslims were pagans, but rather that they belonged to a heretical sect of Christianity and followed the teachings of a false prophet. He often praised the Muslim leaders of his own day, even if he lamented their power over the Christian kingdom; thus Muslim rulers such as Mu'in ad-Din Unur, Nur ad-Din, Shirkuh, and even Jerusalem's ultimate conqueror Saladin <b>are</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> honourable and pious men, characteristics that William did not bestow on many of his own Christian contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|In Shin Megami Tensei II, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} the gladiator Hawk, who is able to {{communicate}} with demons. The gameplay {{is similar to that of}} the first Shin Megami Tensei: the game is controlled from a first-person view, and has the player exploring dungeons and navigating outdoor areas, which <b>are</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> 2D maps seen from a top-down perspective. In both these types of areas, the player encounters and battles against demons; a gauge on the bottom of the screen shows the likelihood of a demon encounter.|$|E
5000|$|Work <b>was</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> {{a social}} duty, because Italy {{was greater than}} any {{individual}} purpose. [...] Beehives <b>were</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> a model of industry and harmony.|$|R
50|$|From 1980 to 2011, {{the award}} <b>was</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> {{part of the}} Genie Awards; since 2012, it has <b>been</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> part of the Canadian Screen Awards.|$|R
30|$|Continuous data <b>were</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> {{mean and}} {{standard}} deviation while categorical data <b>were</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> counts and percentages. The coefficient of variation (CoV) was calculated as the standard deviation/mean ratio.|$|R
5|$|Pegasus Bridge {{features}} ten {{different types}} of terrain, which affect {{the movement of the}} troops and the defensibility of certain areas. If units are situated in towns or woodland areas, their attacks will be less effective. High wind speeds will also render British parachuting troops temporarily ineffective. Units on the map <b>are</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> small squares and can be stacked together to increase defence. While British forces may destroy various bridges throughout the game, certain bridges such as those over the Caen Canal and Orne river must be preserved in order to win the game.|$|E
5|$|The Lunar: The Silver Star Original Soundtrack was {{released}} exclusively in Japan by Toshiba-EMI Records on April 22, 1992, {{two months before}} the actual release of the game. The album features full versions of the Japanese opening and ending themes, as well as karaoke arrangements. Most of the game's background themes <b>are</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> multi-song medleys rather than separate tracks. Although an official North American version was never released, many of the songs present on the album were featured as special arrangements on the bonus soundtrack found in the Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete collector's edition, including the English opening theme.|$|E
5|$|The album's lyrical {{themes are}} dark, {{focusing}} on global tensions and political happenings during 2014. The {{rise of the}} Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, {{media coverage of the}} 2015 general election in the United Kingdom, and various mass shootings influenced its writing. The band's musical sound was composed to provide contradiction to the violent subject matter, and is inspired by artists such as Radiohead, Suicide, and Kendrick Lamar. As with previous Everything Everything work, most of the songs <b>are</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> in-character narrations.|$|E
30|$|Continuous {{numerical}} data <b>were</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> mean and SD, and between group differences were compared using the unpaired t test. Discrete {{numerical data}} <b>were</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> median and interquartile range, and inter-group differences were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Qualitative data <b>were</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> number and percentage and the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, when appropriate, {{was applied for}} comparison of between-group differences.|$|R
30|$|Normally {{distributed}} data <b>were</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> {{mean and}} standard deviations, whereas skewed distributed data <b>were</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> medians with a range. In case of dichotomous variables, data <b>were</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> absolute numbers with percentages. Differences between groups (patients versus nurses, and preoperative versus postoperative assessment in the patients) were tested with t tests and Mann–Whitney tests, as appropriate. Chi-square tests were used for dichotomous data.|$|R
30|$|Results <b>were</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> {{the mean}} ± SEM. Graph-Pad Prism {{software}} {{was used to}} perform a two-tailed Student’s t-test. Statistical significance <b>was</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> *P values < 0.05, **P values < 0.01 and ***P values < 0.001.|$|R
5|$|The book is an {{extensive}} work of investigative journalism, {{written in the}} form of an encompassing time line; the events that shaped the epidemic <b>are</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> sequential matter-of-fact summaries. Shilts describes the impact and the politics involved in battling the disease on particular individuals in the gay, medical, and political communities. Shilts begins his discussion in 1977 with the first confirmed case of AIDS, that of Grethe Rask, a Danish doctor working in Africa. He ends with the announcement by actor Rock Hudson in 1985 that he was dying of AIDS, when international attention on the disease exploded.|$|E
5|$|To {{help promote}} {{the song and}} album, Yankovic {{directed}} a music video that was a direct parody of the Crash Test Dummies' original. In it, the three news stories <b>are</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> if they are one-act plays before an audience of people. The video took two days to film and ended up running over the allotted time that had been scheduled for filming. The resulting video was also extremely expensive to fund. Several notable individuals made cameos in the video, such as Doug Llewelyn, Dr. Demento and Judy Tenuta.|$|E
5|$|The backstory {{presented}} in StarCrafts manual {{and in the}} novel Shadow Hunters also shows {{the rise of a}} second society of Protoss known as the Nerazim. They are a sizeable minority of the Protoss who reject the Khala out of fear of losing their individuality inside the psychic link. The Nerazim are treated as heretics by the Khalai Protoss and are forcibly evicted from Aiur. Despite their persecution, the majority of Dark Templar do not hold anything against their estranged brethren, seeking to defend Aiur in any way they can. The Nerazim <b>are</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> nomadic, liberal society, only settling on the planet Shakuras to study a Xel'Naga temple there. During the Brood War event, the Protoss lose their homeworld of Aiur to the Zerg (even with the Overmind being destroyed by Tassadar) and the Khalai Protoss are forced to escape and seek refuge on Shakuras, by then the homeworld of the Nerazim Protoss. After the conclusion of StarCraft, the two groups begin to reconcile, but the reconciliation is marred by mutual distrust.|$|E
30|$|Data were collected, {{tabulated}} then statistically {{analyzed using}} Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS); computer software version (15).

30|$|Data were {{collected}} and analyzed using SPSS software (SPSS Inc., version 22, Chicago: SPSS Inc). Continuous data were tested for normality of distribution where normally distributed data <b>were</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> mean[*]±[*]SD while non-normally distributed data <b>were</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> median (interquartile range). Categorical and nominal data <b>were</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> number and or percentage. Independent sample t test and chi-square test {{were used to}} detect statistical {{differences between the two}} groups. P value was considered significant if less than 0.05.|$|R

30|$|The results {{relating}} to continuous variables {{as well as}} to changes in continuous variables were described with number (n), mean, SD, and range for each group. The results of the SF- 36 <b>were</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> the mean with the 95 % confidence interval, while those of the EQ- 5 D <b>were</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> the mean with the standard error, according to the most used standards for these questionnaires. The results for categorical variables, including dichotomous variables, <b>were</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> a number and percentage.|$|R
50|$|Tonalite is an igneous, {{plutonic}} (intrusive) rock, of felsic composition, with phaneritic texture. Feldspar <b>is</b> <b>present</b> <b>as</b> plagioclase (typically oligoclase or andesine) with 10% or less alkali feldspar. Quartz <b>is</b> <b>present</b> <b>as</b> {{more than}} 20% of the rock. Amphiboles and pyroxenes are common accessory minerals.|$|R
25|$|The Sanskrit {{version of}} the Panchatantra text gives names to the animal characters, but these names are {{creative}} with double meanings. The names connote the character observable in nature but also map a human personality that a reader can readily identify. For example, the deer characters <b>are</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> a metaphor for charming, innocent, peaceful and tranquil personality who is a target for those who seek a prey to exploit, while crocodiles <b>are</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> a symbolism for those with dangerous intent hiding beneath welcoming ambiance (waters of a lotus flower-laden pond). Dozens {{of different types of}} wildlife found in India are thus named, and they constitute an array of symbolic characters in the Panchatantra. Thus, the names of the animals evoke layered meaning that resonates with the reader, and the same story can be read at different levels.|$|E
25|$|According to Sam van Schaik, {{who studies}} early Dzogchen manuscripts from the Dunhuang caves, the Dzogchen texts are {{influenced}} by earlier Mahayana sources such as the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra and Indian Buddhist Tantras with their teaching of emptiness and luminosity, which in Dzogchen texts <b>are</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> 'ever-purity' (ka-dag) and 'spontaneous presence' (lhun-grub).|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} that Stargate SG-1 begins, the Goa'uld <b>are</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> the {{dominant}} species of the Milky Way galaxy, having been so for millennia. By and large, the Goa'uld are shown to be utterly arrogant and obsessed with gaining personal power. To this end, they constantly scheme and fight amongst themselves. Arrogance is presented as their greatest weakness; Teal'c once states that he has seen many brilliant battle plans fall apart because a single Goa'uld needed to boast about them. The Goa'uld are shown to rule by fear and oppression, regularly employing mass torture and execution, and using their advanced technology to present themselves as omnipotent gods. They <b>are</b> <b>presented</b> <b>as</b> regularly attacking advanced races that they believe may pose a potential threat, such as the Reetou and the Re'ol, while suppressing technological progress in their own subject populations.|$|E
