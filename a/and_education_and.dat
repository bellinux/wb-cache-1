5|$|Murray married Elizabeth Finch. They did {{not have}} {{children}} and took on care of their niece, Lady Elizabeth Murray (b. 1760), after her mother died. When Mansfield's nephew Captain Sir John Lindsay returned to Britain in 1765 following the Seven Years' War and his assignment in the West Indies, he brought his natural daughter Elizabeth. Of half African descent, she was born into slavery in 1761, the daughter of Maria Bell, an enslaved woman.

5|$|Though the {{prevailing}} Soviet ideology stressed gender equality in labor <b>and</b> <b>education,</b> <b>and</b> many Soviet women held jobs and advanced degrees, {{they did not}} participate in core political roles and institutions.

While propaganda claimed, accurately, that more women sat in the Supreme Soviet than in most democratic countries' legislative bodies combined, only two women, Yekaterina Furtseva and (in its last year of existence) Galina Semyonova, were ever members of the party's Politburo, in practice the country's real leadership.|$|E

5|$|While the BPC was {{primarily}} political, Black Consciousness activists also established the Black Community Programmes (BCPs) {{to focus on}} improving healthcare <b>and</b> <b>education</b> <b>and</b> fostering black economic self-reliance. The BCPs had strong ecumenical links, being part-funded by a program on Christian action, established by the Christian Institute of Southern Africa and the South African Council of Churches. Additional funds came from the Anglo-American Corporation, the International University Exchange Fund, and Scandinavian churches. In 1972, the BCP hired Biko and Bokwe Mafuna, allowing Biko to continue his political and community work. In September 1972, Biko visited Kimberley, where he met the PAC founder and anti-apartheid activist Robert Sobukwe.|$|E
5|$|For some Germans, the {{definition}} of nation did not include pluralism, and Catholics in particular came under scrutiny; some Germans, and especially Bismarck, feared that the Catholics' connection to the papacy might make them less loyal to the nation. As chancellor, Bismarck tried without much success to limit {{the influence of the}} Roman Catholic Church and of its party-political arm, the Catholic Center Party, in schools <b>and</b> <b>education</b> <b>and</b> language-related policies. The Catholic Center Party remained particularly well entrenched in the Catholic strongholds of Bavaria and southern Baden, and in urban areas that held high populations of displaced rural workers seeking jobs in the heavy industry, and sought to protect the rights not only of Catholics, but other minorities, including the Poles, and the French minorities in the Alsatian lands. The May Laws of 1873 brought the appointment of priests, and their education, {{under the control of the}} state, resulting in the closure of many seminaries, and a shortage of priests. The Congregations Law of 1875 abolished religious orders, ended state subsidies to the Catholic Church, and removed religious protections from the Prussian constitution.|$|E
5|$|However, the BC NDP {{were deeply}} unpopular within the province, {{reaching}} a low at 15% support in opinion polls {{at the time}} of Glen Clark's resignation as Premier in August 1999. With Dosanjh as leader, support had risen to 21% by August 2000. Dosanjh was consistently ranked higher personal popularity over opposition leader Gordon Campbell until the run-up to the May 16, 2001, provincial election. Dosanjh and the BC NDP knew they would not be reelected, so they concentrated their campaign to a few ridings in the Lower Mainland which were still considered competitive. Their campaign focused on the expanding economy, issues of health care <b>and</b> <b>education,</b> <b>and</b> Dosanjh's personal popularity over Campbell. Dosanjh conceded defeat a week before the election, but requested voters consider making the NDP a strong opposition party. After the vote, on May 16, Dosanjh lost his seat in Vancouver-Kensington along with all but two members of his Cabinet in the second-worst defeat of a sitting provincial government in Canada. The BC Liberals won all 77 other seats.|$|E

40|$|Technical <b>and</b> {{vocational}} <b>education</b> <b>and</b> {{training programs}} {{as a form}} of peace education are examined in this paper. It explores the notion of educating for a culture of peace through refocusing technical <b>and</b> vocational <b>education</b> <b>and</b> training programs on sustainable community development in the Solomon Islands. It further highlights the policy and practice mechanisms that contribute to advancing technical <b>and</b> vocational <b>education</b> <b>and</b> training as a peace education initiative. As a model of the applicability of the program {{as a form of}} peace education, the discussion describes a technical <b>and</b> vocational <b>education</b> <b>and</b> training centre in the Solomon Islands that has engaged in post-conflict livelihood projects – bringing about healing and restoration and creating the culture of peace. This is a practical and comprehensive model to peace education that extends beyond the centre and embraces the culture of peace in the community as a whole. The implications point to technical <b>and</b> vocational <b>education</b> <b>and</b> training as a means to achieve co-existence. Technical <b>and</b> vocational <b>education</b> <b>and</b> training as a form of peace education is capable of training people for a productive livelihood, creating a sense of national identity and unity, rehabilitating former militants and moving training programs outside the walls of the institutions. As a result, the pedagogy of technical <b>and</b> vocational <b>education</b> <b>and</b> training as a form of peace education is largely based on learning by doing which incorporates a number of peace activities...|$|R
