40|$|The Limits of Equality – Wishing for Discrimination? Yifat Bitton Abstract The {{article focuses}} on the {{different}} manner in which antidiscrimination regimes treat groups that have been discriminated-against de jure and de facto. The Article approaches the prerequisite of antidiscrimination laws that there be some past or on-going discrimination {{in a manner that}} diverges from the dominant view that discrimination is a purely destructive force. The central argument is that the way in which de jure, overt and blatant discrimination necessarily must create a coherent group identity recognized by law allows groups that are discriminated against in this manner to obtain remedial relief, whereas the law fails to recognize a coherent group identity for de facto discriminated-against groups and thus these groups have to overcome a structural challenge to obtain remedial relief to counter the discrimination.

40|$|Most of the {{shoreline}} of the Campania region, Southern Italy, {{is characterized by}} steep and high rocky slopes, then several localities, densely populated and highly touristic attractive for the worldwide famous landscapes are exposed to an high rockfall risk. Particularly, the touristic localities on the Sorrentine Peninsula, such as Sorrento, Vico Equense and Amalfi, can be considered among the most representative case-studies prone to the recurrent instability of rock blocks. Due to the frequent location of settlements and roads underneath and at very limited or null distances from the carbonate steep slopes, a diffuse condition of high rockfall risk exists. Consequently, the assessment of priorities in directing <b>active</b> <b>remedial</b> works {{to be carried out}} on the unstable rock slopes is still a challenging issue. In order to find an effective method for assessing the susceptibility to rockfall initiation with approaches suitable for detailed mapping, a combined application of standard methods was tested. The Romana’s Slope Mass Rating (SMR) and the Matheson’s graphical tests, for assessing the number of fundamental instability mechanisms, were applied in a test site of the Sorrento coast. Results of the two methods were separately evaluated and then combined in a new rating approach by indexing the respective susceptibility classes. In addition, the number of joint sets and the macro-structural features of the rock-mass (faults and master joints) were considered. By means of statistical analyses of rockfalls occurred in the test area, the results obtained with the new combined approach were found more accurate in assessing and mapping the most susceptible areas...|$|R

40|$|<b>Active</b> <b>remedial</b> {{activities}} have been ongoing since 1996 to address {{low levels of}} solvent contamination at the Miscellaneous Chemical Basin at SRS. Contaminant levels in the subsurface may be approaching levels where mass transfer limitations are impacting {{the efficiency of the}} remedial action. Rate limited mass transfer effects have been observed at other sites in the vadose zone at the SRS, however, detailed measurements and evaluation has not been undertaken. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the mass transfer rates are very slow from the fine grain sediments. This conclusion is based on the observation that measured soil gas concentrations tend to be low in permeable zones relative to the higher concentrations found in fine grain zones. Decreasing soil gas concentration with depth below the ''upland unit'' at several areas at SRS is also evidence of slow diffusion rates. In addition, due to the length of time since disposal ceased at the MCB, we hypothesize that mobile solvents have migrated downward, and the solvent remaining in the upper fine grain zone (''upland unit'') are trapped in fine grain material and are primarily released by gas diffusion (Riha and Rossabi 2004). Natural weathering and other chemical solutions disposed with the solvents can further enhance this effect by increasing the micro-porosity in the clays (kaolinite). This microporosity can result in increased entrapment of water and solvents by capillary forces (Powers, et. al., 2003). Also supporting this conclusion is the observation that active SVE has proven ineffective on VOC removal from the fine grain zones at the SRS. Adsorption and the very slow release phenomenon have been documented similarly in the literature especially for old solvent spills such as at the SRS (Pavlostathis and Mathavan 1992; Oostrom and Lenhard 2003). Mass transfer relationships need to be developed in order to optimize remediation activities and to determine actual loading rates to groundwater. These metrics will aid in answering the question ''How clean is protective of the environment''? For this study, a field test was developed to measure a mass transfer factor by injecting clean air into the subsurface through a sample port or well and measuring the rebound VOC concentration over time. Interpretation of the he results of these tests will provide a mass transfer rate that will be used to determine the appropriate type of SVE for the area (passive, enhanced or active SVE), a measured field parameter to estimate mass loading to the groundwater, and time frame for cleanup...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{major concern}} in {{sediment}} capping effectiveness is gas ebullition from organic matter biodegradation in sediments. Gases may open advective channels {{that can result}} in substantial pollution release. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the gas ebullition rate in sediments in preparation for construction of an active capping technology demonstration at the Collateral Channel site in the Chicago River. Sediment samples were collected from five sites along a transection of Collateral Channel from the combined sewer outfall at the Channel terminus. Biogenic gas production was measured in samples incubated at 5 ° to 35 ° C. Gas production followed a first order reaction trend and Arrhenius plots were obtained to determine the temperature dependence of the kinetic rate. These allowed us to predict gas ebullition for the annual temperature variation in the sediments. CO 2 /CH 4 ratios change with temperature, with lower ratios at lower temperatures suggesting dominance by acetoclastic methanogens. These data were used to select adequate <b>active</b> capping <b>remedial</b> alternatives for the Channel. We conclude that wide variations in gas production occur, necessitating gas capture/control during the elevated temperatures of summer. To achieve this, an innovative geo-mesh material with an overlying highly permeable layer will be employed...|$|R

This phase includes construction or implementation of the project design, but not complete cleanup. In order for the human exposure {{status of the}} site to be considered under control, contamination levels must be safe and controls must be in place to prevent human exposure. Since the area is a major water supply to surrounding homes and businesses, monitoring of lead levels in the groundwater is currently ongoing and thus far indicates that contaminant levels have declined or remained stable. Although risk may be low, blood lead levels are a major concern, especially for pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children as contaminants can cause a variety of adverse health effects such as cell toxicity or neurodevelopmental defects. As a result, current blood-lead testing, outreach and education programs are being implemented in the Lake County area. The next step in the cleanup process is to conduct a 5-year review to determine the success of the current plan in protecting human health and the environment.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{three-dimensional}} model describing {{the evolution of}} a gypsum karst aquifer along the Birs river near Basel in Switzerland. Here, a small dam-site was built in 1890 to generate hydro-electric power. After subsidence of a nearby highway, geophysical and geological field studies have been carried out and a detailed hydrogeological model has been developed. These observations identified a karstified weathered zone as the reason for the subsidence. To prevent any further damage, remedial construction measures have been carried out. We employ our numerical model KARSTAQUIFER, which simulates the temporal evolution of a karst system by dissolution, increasing the porosity in the aquifer. We used results from geological and geophysical investigations as a priori information for implementing the initial boundary conditions into our three-dimensional numerical model. Our model accounts for topography, precipitation and geology and especially for the anisotropy of the local bedrock. It can successfully reproduce the weathered zone in its current horizontal and vertical extent. We cm also simulate the possible evolution of the aquifer following a <b>remedial</b> construction <b>phase.</b> Therefore, taken together with the geophysical and geological observations and the groundwater model, our three-dimensional karst aquifer evolution model enhances the understanding of the development of this heterogeneous karst aquifer system.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the application of Gagné's learning hierarchy model to the learning {{of the concept of}} a food web, an important topic in biology curricula. Few validated learning hierarchies {{have been reported in the}} literature for concepts outside the realm of mathematics and the physical sciences. As a result, the application of Gagné's model in the present study provided some information regarding the applicability of the model to such a concept. In addition, the process of validating the hypothesized learning hierarchy provided a ready means by which to investigate students' misconceptions regarding skills comprising the hierarchy. Hence a second aspect of the present study concerned the identification of common misconceptions which grade ten biology students hold regarding the food web concept. This in turn provided some information regarding the applicability of the learning hierarchy model to the study of students' misconceptions. [...] The sample consisted of 200 grade ten biology students from three coeducational schools in the St. John's area. A learning hierarchy was developed for the food web concept using a Gagné-type task analysis. Upon completion of regular classroom instruction on food webs, the sample was tested on the skills comprising the food web hierarchy. Following this pretest a self-instructional booklet, designed to remediate the skills of the food web hierarchy for students who had failed to learn them initially, was administered. Each subject received an individualized prescription for the remediation of skills which were failed on the pretest. Following the <b>remedial</b> <b>phase,</b> a parallel form of the pretest was administered to the sample. These data were analyzed using two psychometric validation techniques, the ordering theoretic and the Dayton and Macready methods. Griffiths' method was used to investigate the hierarchy in terms of its transfer validity. Data from test items which were answered incorrectly were analyzed and subjects' misconceptions were recorded. [...] The hypothesized food web hierarchy was found to be valid both psychometrically and in terms of transfer, although transfer of learning for connections involving lower skills of the hierarchy could not be determined because too few students failed these skills in the pretest. However, the validated hierarchy appears to offer much potential use as an instructional tool for the instruction of food webs. In addition, these findings indicate some support for the applicability of the learning hierarchy model to concepts other than those of mathematics and the physical sciences. Five common misconceptions held by grade ten biology students concerning food webs, food chains and predation were identified. In one case, a misconception was revealed for a large part of the sample in items testing subordinate skills, but did not occur in the case of the terminal skill. This suggests that the learning hierarchy model may be useful in the study of misconceptions, in that it has the ability to reveal underlying misconceptions which would not be apparent from students' responses to the terminal skill alone...|$|R
40|$|In May of 2004, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Richland and Fluor Hanford {{requested}} {{technical assistance}} from DOE Headquarters EM- 23 {{to provide a}} team of technical experts to evaluate likely chemical/biological amendments for mending the In Situ Redox Manipulation (ISRM) Barrier in the 100 -D Area of the Hanford Site. This request was a follow-on to an earlier request for assistance regarding the cause of chromium (Cr) breakthrough and recommendations for mending the barrier (March 2004 workshop). This report provides written documentation of the team's findings and recommendations. In 1995, a plume of dissolved hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI) ] was discovered along the Columbia River shoreline and in the 100 -D Area. Between 1999 and 2003, a reactive barrier using the ISRM technology, was installed {{at a distance of}} 680 meters along the river to reduce the Cr(VI) in the groundwater. The ISRM technology creates a treatment zone within the aquifer by injection of sodium dithionite, a strong reducing agent that scavenges dissolved oxygen (DO) from the aquifer and reduces ferric iron [Fe(III) ], related metals, and oxy-ions. Bench-scale and field-scale treatability tests were conducted to demonstrate proof-of principle and to estimate barrier longevity, calculated to be in excess of twenty years. However, several years after initial and secondary treatment, groundwater in approximately 17 wells has been found to contain elevated Cr concentrations. The March 2004 technical assistance team (TAT) identified potential causes of Cr breakthrough as likely related to physical and chemical heterogeneity within the aquifer (including loss of reductive capacity within preferential flow paths) and the presence of other oxidants (DO and nitrate) significantly affecting the reductive capacity of the treated aquifer. These aquifer characteristics may limit the ability of alternative amendments to extend the reducing capacity of the barrier. A 2001 Bechtel Hanford report and evaluation of the ISRM performance data and barrier longevity assessment corroborate the observations and findings of the March 2004 TAT. The March 2004 TAT recommended the collection of new aquifer characterization data in combination with the interpretation of existing data to develop a conceptual model of aquifer heterogeneity to enable design of the most appropriate barrier mending system. The current TAT was convened to examine the most promising amendment that could be applied to mend the ISRM barrier. The Technical Assistance Team (TAT) performed the following activities: (1) Evaluate the most appropriate single or combination of chemical/biological amendments suitable for increasing the reductive capacity of the ISRM barrier; (2) Evaluate the most practicable means of introducing chemical/biological amendments in the target zones along the current BRM barrier; (3) Provide recommendations for laboratory treatability-testing protocol development to evaluate the type and delivery mechanisms of amendments in the current ISRM barrier location. Sections of this report present analyses and recommendations of potential amendments and delivery options to improve performance of the ISRM barrier. The report covers the spectrum of passive barrier mending to chemical and biological amendments that have been shown to perform more efficiently in more <b>active</b> <b>remedial</b> design approaches. Because DOE/RL is considering significant aquifer characterization studies as additional time and cost investment to mending the barrier, the TAT strongly recommends that DOE/RL conduct cost-benefit analyses of alternative designs to mend the barrier. In this way, the value and extent of characterization studies, compared to passive amendment delivery, compared to engineering redesign, can be quantitatively estimated for decision-making purposes...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{reports the}} results of groundwater sampling in September-October 2005 and March 2006 at the grain storage facility formerly operated at Centralia, Kansas, by the Commodity Credit Corporation of the U. S. Department of Agriculture (CCC/USDA). These activities were {{the first and second}} twice yearly sampling events of the two-year monitoring program approved by the CCC/USDA and Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) project managers. The initial monitoring network sampled in September and October 2005 consisted of six monitoring wells (MW 1 -MW 6) installed in 2004, plus five groundwater piezometers (SB 01, SB 04, SB 05, SB 08, SB 09) installed in 2002. The combined September-October 2005 sampling was the first monitoring event in the planned two-year program for Centralia. The groundwater samples collected in both September and October were analyzed for volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and samples collected in September were analyzed for dissolved hydrogen and additional groundwater parameters to aid in evaluating the potential for reductive dechlorination processes. After the monitoring in September-October 2005, Argonne recommended expansion of the initial monitoring network. Previous sampling (August 2004) had already suggested that this network of six monitoring wells and five piezometers was inadequate to delineate the extent of the carbon tetrachloride plume. With the approval of the CCC/USDA and KDHE project managers, the monitoring network was expanded in January 2006 through the installation of four additional monitoring wells (MW 7 -MW 10) and one new piezometer (SB 07 R) to replace a damaged piezometer (the former SB 07). Details of the monitoring well and piezometer installations are reported in this document. The expanded monitoring network of ten monitoring wells (MW 01 -MW 10) and six piezometers (SB 01, SB 04, SB 05, SB 07 R, SB 08, and SB 09) was sampled in March 2006. This March 2006 sampling was the second monitoring event in the planned two-year program. Results of analyses for VOCs showed further increases in contaminant levels and expansion of the carbon tetrachloride plume toward the south and west from the former CCC/USDA facility. The groundwater samples collected in March 2006 were also analyzed for additional groundwater parameters to aid in the evaluation of the potential for reductive dechlorination processes. Preliminary screening of groundwater parameters provided limited evidence that reductive dechlorination of carbon tetrachloride is taking place at some locations on the former CCC/USDA facility. Groundwater levels measured manually in September 2005, March 2006, and June 2006 were used to map the potentiometric surface at Centralia. Overall, these results were consistent {{with each other and with}} previous measurements, generally indicating a groundwater flow direction toward the south-southwest from the former CCC/USDA facility. Data recorders installed in wells MW 01 -MW 06 in August 2004 are gathering long-term data on the groundwater elevation and gradient. Data downloaded in March 2005, September 2005, and June 2006 indicate that two wells north and west of the former CCC/USDA facility boundary show distinct, transient and seasonal water level variations. In contrast, two different wells southwest and south of the former facility boundary show virtually no response to the same events. The first two monitoring events of the planned two-year monitoring program for Centralia have demonstrated increased carbon tetrachloride concentrations and lateral expansion of the contaminated zone.

In the first phase, a corpus linguistics based error analysis was conducted, in which 50 student essays were compiled and scrutinized for formal errors. A tagging system was specially devised and employed in the analysis. The EA results, together with an examination of Foundation tutors’ perceptions of error frequency and gravity led me to prioritise article errors for treatment; in the second <b>phase,</b> <b>remedial</b> materials were drafted based on the EA results and insights drawn from my investigations into four research areas (article pedagogy, SLA theory, grammar teaching approaches and CALL methodologies) and existing grammar materials; in the third phase, the materials were refined and evaluated for their effectiveness {{as a means of}} improving the Chinese Foundation students’ use of the article. Findings confirm the claim that L 2 learner errors are systematic in nature and lend support to the value of Error Analysis. L 1 transfer appears {{to be one of the}} main contributing factors in L 2 errors. The salient errors identified in the Chinese Foundation corpus show that mismanagement of the article system is the most frequent cause of grammatical errors; Foundation tutors, however, perceive article errors to be neither frequent nor serious. An examination of existing materials reveals that the article is given low priority in ELT textbooks and treatments provided in pedagogical grammar books are inappropriate in terms of presentation, language and exercise types. The devised remedial materials employ both consciousness-raising activities and production exercises, using EAP language and authentic learner errors. Preliminary evaluation results suggest that the EA-informed customised materials have the potential to help learners to perform better in proofreading article errors in academic texts.

The 6 + 1 Trait ® Writing Scoring Continuum (Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory, early 1980 s) was employed to assess the participant 2 ̆ 7 s writing performance, and the Flanders Interaction Analysis Categories (FIAC) (Flanders, 1970) were used to note his on-task/off-task behavior and the categories of his responses during tutoring sessions. An auditor was employed to confirm the investigator 2 ̆ 7 s evaluations; if contradictions occurred, the artifact in question was omitted from the study. The participant underwent extensive educational assessment regarding his reading and writing predilections and habits prior to study begin (quantitative data) in the form of rating scales, such as the Classroom Reading Inventory, the Elementary Writing Attitude Scale, and others. He was further observed during clinical supervision (audio- and videotaping), and underwent qualitative assessment (content analysis of written output) during the study, and post-study performance tests (quantitative and qualitative data). Baseline graphs were employed to establish the traits of his writing behavior during all three experimental stages (pre-treatment, treatment, post-treatment), and tutor logs shed further light on the participant 2 ̆ 7 s feelings and behavior under each condition. The interwoven mixed data revealed that the participant enjoyed the tutoring sessions, and even cried twice when he missed one, but that his attention deficit and off-task behavior severely interfered with the organization and quantity of his written output. The Flanders analysis showed that the slightest distraction through his environment (tutor, second tutee, etc.) took his focus off his writing tasks, and that the tiniest thing out of order (e. g., a wrong digital display of the current time of day on his computer screen) could occupy his thoughts for minutes, or trigger an exaggerated outburst after half an hour. Flanders also confirmed, as the higher quality of his output had shown, that the boy was strongly motivated by what interested him (Star Wars), and that he would put extra care in the creation of corresponding tasks. It can be concluded that self-chosen material, and not the format of graphic novels, motivated the participant to work. The content analysis of his post-treatment essay as compared to his pre-treatment essay showed that he was able to finish it, that the length had augmented, that the chronological order of events was maintained thanks to having learned organization through panels, but that the creativity and ideas had declined. Finally, the analysis of The 6 + 1 Trait ® Writing Scoring Continuum, which examined ideas, organization, voice, word choice, sentence fluency, conventions, and presentation of ten writing samples per stage, showed that the participant had scored 30. 2 in the pre-treatment stage, 29. 2 in the treatment stage, and 32. 8 in the post-treatment stage. Given that the participant had matured during the two and a half years of study, the gain was not important enough to justify a graphic novel intervention to improve the writing of this specific student. The astonishing low score in the easiest stage, the treatment stage itself (where he only had to fill in speech bubbles) was a result of the genre itself (which called for less descriptive written output) and of the fact that the participant thought this stage was “easy” (as per interview from 05 / 17 / 2011) and might have felt not sufficiently challenged. It can be concluded that the graphic novel treatment was effective in helping with the chronological organization within the participant 2 ̆ 7 s texts, but this goal could maybe also have been achieved by structuring through sub-headings or perhaps voice recordings of a list of steps. Due to the high off-task behavior and time consumption, this treatment would not be feasible in a classroom setting, but might work in a resource room. During the treatment, the participant revealed himself as auditory, not just visual learner, who was motivated by sound and music, especially in combination with his online Star Wars photo story; he was planning on an animated story with movie features. In the future, this highly articulate child would benefit from self-chosen writing tasks that include the creation of online stories with pictures, animation, and sound. His behavior needed more remediation than the quality of his written output. Future studies should investigate the effectiveness of writing workshops using graphic novels within the classroom setting, as proposed by Thompson (2008), and also assess the benefits of digital story-telling (Burke 2 ̆ 6 Kafai, 2012) as an additional motivational factor, while putting special emphasis on students who display autistic and ADHD behavior...|$|R
40|$|M. Ed. Wilchesky & Reynolds (1986 : 412) have {{identified}} {{three categories of}} families seeking assistance with the child who has a learning barrier. Firstly, there is the functioning family which has the necessary resources to cope with stress associated with {{a child who has}} a learning barrier. The second category is a family which is at risk. Due to the presence of a child with a learning barrier this type of family is more susceptible to becoming dysfunctional when confronted with a situation which is a natural family transition. In this type of family normal life events such as an adolescent leaving home, or the birth of a new sibling, or the youngest child starting school may result in dysfunctional patterns of interaction due to the added stress. The third category is the rigid family, which is categorised by overprotection, enmeshment, over-involvement and resorting to old solutions to resolve new problems. These families need emotional support to enable them to adapt positively to the stress associated with a child who has a learning barrier. The support should be based on the existing family interactions and dynamics. The problem is that no research could be found which investigated family interactions and emotional awareness in families who have children with learning barriers in a South African context. Against this background the questions to be researched in this study can be formulated as follows: How can the interaction, dynamics and emotional awareness of families of children with learning barriers be explored? What guidelines can be developed by the educational psychologist to promote effective emotional support for families who have children with learning barriers? This study is specifically directed at the families of children with learning barriers at a junior <b>phase</b> <b>remedial</b> school where English is the medium of instruction. The aims of the study are: to explore and describe the dynamics, interactions and emotional awareness of families of children with learning barriers in the junior phase of their compulsory education to develop emotion coaching guidelines to promote effective emotional support for a family where there is a child with a learning barrier...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Risk {{to small}} {{property}} investors manifests in the cash {{flow of the}} investment and it should thus also be managed in the cash flow. From a practical point of view it is logical that that risk management strategies be incorporated into a property investment at the inception stage of the investment. The cash flow of a property thus needs to include applicable risk management strategies {{as part of the}} feasibility study of the investment. The chief manner in which small property investors deal with risk in an investment, is by making conservative allowances in the projected cash flow of the investment. Internal risk is thus managed to a degree, but the small investor is still vulnerable to market risk which originates from outside the investment. Market risk however, is relatively successfully managed by the Institutional Sector of the property market through the application of Modern Portfolio Theory {{and the use of the}} portfolio as a vehicle to diversify internal risk. The portfolio vehicle also allows the quantification of external- or market risk, thus creating the opportunity for effective management. It is however believed that the same principles of Modern Portfolio Theory as applied in the institutional sector of the property market, may be applicable to small direct property investments, to formulate an investment risk management strategy, which is embedded in the conceptual stages of the investment and thus reduce the reliance on often, ineffective, <b>active</b> management and <b>remedial</b> strategies during the holding period. The main obstacle however, is that the application of Modern Portfolio Theory requires an industry bench mark or index, which is representative of the market and against which performance may be measured measured. The application of such an index to the small direct property investment is however extremely limited due to a difference between the scale at which small investments function and the scale of the market that an index represents. A substitute for a benchmark to act as a market indicator is thus required, which must be reflective of the market within which the small investment operates. This report investigates the possibility of deriving an investment-specific benchmark or a hypothetical return curve, based on the relationships that exist between the macro-economy and the property market. If it is indeed possible to establish the credibility of such an alternative market indicator, it would therefore become possible for small property investors to apply the risk management principles inherent to portfolio investing and incorporate these principles in the feasibility cash flows of small direct property investments...|$|R
