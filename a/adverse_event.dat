5|$|Most {{countries}} place {{dietary supplements}} {{in a special}} category under the general umbrella of foods, not drugs. As a result, the manufacturer, and not the government, has the responsibility of ensuring that its dietary supplement products are safe before they are marketed. Regulation of supplements varies widely by country. In the United States, a dietary supplement is defined under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. There is no FDA approval process for dietary supplements, and no requirement that manufacturers prove the safety or efficacy of supplements introduced before 1994. The Food and Drug Administration must rely on its <b>Adverse</b> <b>Event</b> Reporting System to monitor adverse events that occur with supplements. In 2007, the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21, part III took effect, regulating Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) in the manufacturing, packaging, labeling, or holding operations for dietary supplements. Even though product registration is not required, these regulations mandate production and quality control standards (including testing for identity, purity and adulterations) for dietary supplements. In the European Union, the Food Supplements Directive requires that only those supplements that have been proven safe can be sold without a prescription.|$|E

40|$|Background: Understanding {{the nature}} and causes of medical <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> may help their prevention. This {{systematic}} re-view explores the types, risk factors, and likely causes of preventable <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> in the hospital sector. Methods: MEDLINE (1970 - 2008), EMBASE, CINAHL (1970 - 2005) and the reference lists were used to identify the stud-ies and a structured narrative method used to synthesise the data. Results: Operative <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> were more common but less preventable and diagnostic <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> less common but more preventable than other <b>adverse</b> <b>events.</b> Preventable <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> were often associated {{with more than one}} contribu-tory factor. The majority of <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> were linked to individual human error, and a significant proportion of these caused serious patient harm. Equipment failure was involved in a small proportion of <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> and rarely caused pa-tient harm. The proportion of system failures varied widely ranging from 3 % to 85 % depending on the data collection and classification methods used. Conclusion: Operative <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> are more common but less preventable than diagnostic <b>adverse</b> <b>events.</b> <b>Adverse</b> <b>events</b> are usually associated with more than one contributory factor, the majority are linked to individual human error, and a proportion of these with system failure...|$|R

25|$|About 1% of {{hospital}} admissions {{result in an}} <b>adverse</b> <b>event</b> due to negligence. However, mistakes are likely much more common, as these studies identify only mistakes that led to measurable adverse events occurring soon after the errors. Independent review of doctors' treatment plans suggests that decision-making could be improved in 14% of admissions; many of the benefits would have delayed manifestations. Even this number may be an underestimate. One study suggests that adults in the United States receive only 55% of recommended care. At the same time, a second study found that 30% of care in the United States may be unnecessary. For example, if a doctor fails to order a mammogram that is past due, this mistake will not {{show up in the}} first type of study. In addition, because no <b>adverse</b> <b>event</b> occurred during the short follow-up of the study, the mistake also would not show up in the second type of study because only the principal treatment plans were critiqued. However, the mistake would be recorded in the third type of study. If a doctor recommends an unnecessary treatment or test, it may not show in any of these types of studies.|$|E

The {{aim of the}} study was to examine how known predictors and <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> interacted with <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> using structural statistical methods. Methods. Five predictors (age, cyclophosphamide, total Ig and CD 4 /CD 8 ratio prior RTX, and type of RTX maintenance regimen) and 4 <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> (severe and chronic infections, hypogammaglobulinemia, and RTX discontinuation) were modeled in principal component and redundancy analyses.

25|$|The use of {{effective}} communication among patients and healthcare professionals {{is critical for}} achieving a patient's optimal health outcome. However, according to the Canadian Patient Safety Institute, ineffective communication has the opposite effect as {{it can lead to}} patient harm.

Use {{of effective}} communication can aid in the prevention of adverse events, whereas ineffective communication can contribute to these incidences. If ineffective communication contributes to an <b>adverse</b> <b>event,</b> then better and more effective communication skills must be applied in response to achieve optimal outcomes for the patient's safety. There are different modes in which healthcare professionals can work to optimize the safety of patients which include both verbal and nonverbal communication, as well as the effective use of appropriate communication technologies.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} {{tranquilizer}} or antipsychotic medication, chlorpromazine (Thorazine), a typical antipsychotic, {{was discovered in}} 1951 and introduced into clinical practice shortly thereafter. Clozapine (Clozaril), an atypical antipsychotic, fell out of favor due to concerns over drug-induced agranulocytosis. Following research indicating its effectiveness in treatment-resistant schizophrenia {{and the development of}} an <b>adverse</b> <b>event</b> monitoring system, clozapine re-emerged as a viable antipsychotic. According to Barker (2003), the three most-accepted atypical drugs are clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine. However, he goes on to explain that clozapine is usually the last resort when other drugs fail. Clozapine can cause agranulocytosis (a decreased number of white blood cells), requiring blood monitoring for the patient. Despite the effectiveness of clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, agents with a more favorable side-effect profile were sought-after for widespread use. During the 1990s, olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine were introduced, with ziprasidone and aripiprazole following in the early 2000s. The atypical anti-psychotic paliperidone was approved by the FDA in late 2006.|$|E

We {{conducted a}} systematic review of <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> associated with {{yellow fever vaccination}} in vulnerable populations. Nine electronic bibliographic databases and reference lists of included articles were searched. Electronic databases identified 2, 415 abstracts for review, and 32 abstracts were included in this review. We identified nine studies of <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> in infants and children, eight studies of <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> in preg-nant women, nine studies of <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients, five studies of <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> in persons 60 years and older, and one study of <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> in individuals taking immunosuppressive medica-tions.

Ten inpatient psychiatric units for older people were recruited. Five followed a PET management pathway, whilst five continued usual care. All <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> and incidents were recorded in routine hospital records over 72 weeks.
