500|$|... "This Was <b>a</b> <b>Real</b> <b>Nice</b> Clambake" [...] – Carrie, Nettie, Julie, Enoch and Chorus ...|$|E
500|$|Everyone reminisces {{about the}} huge meal and much fun ("This Was <b>a</b> <b>Real</b> <b>Nice</b> Clambake"). [...] Jigger tries to seduce Carrie; Enoch walks {{in at the}} wrong moment, and {{declares}} that he is finished with her ("Geraniums In the Winder"), as Jigger jeers ("There's Nothin' So Bad for a Woman"). The girls try to comfort Carrie, but for Julie all that matters is that [...] "he's your feller and you love him" [...] ("What's the Use of Wond'rin'?"). [...] Julie sees Billy trying to sneak away with Jigger and, trying to stop him, feels the knife hidden in his shirt. [...] She begs him {{to give it to}} her, but he refuses and leaves to commit the robbery.|$|E
500|$|Hammerstein and Rodgers {{returned}} to the Liliom project in mid-1944. [...] Hammerstein was uneasy as he worked, fearing {{that no matter what}} they did, Molnár would disapprove of the results. [...] Green Grow the Lilacs had been a little-known work; Liliom was a theatrical standard. [...] Molnár's text also contained considerable commentary on the Hungarian politics of 1909 and the rigidity of that society. [...] A dismissed carnival barker who hits his wife, attempts a robbery and commits suicide seemed an unlikely central character for a musical comedy. [...] Hammerstein decided to use the words and story to make the audience sympathize with the lovers. [...] He also built up the secondary couple, who are incidental to the plot in Liliom; they became Enoch Snow and Carrie Pipperidge. [...] "This Was <b>a</b> <b>Real</b> <b>Nice</b> Clambake" [...] was repurposed from a song, [...] "A Real Nice Hayride", written for Oklahoma! but not used.|$|E
500|$|In Martin Scorsese's 2011 {{documentary}} , released {{ten years}} after Harrison's death, the song plays over footage of the Friar Park grounds and of Harrison making music {{in the house with}} Keltner and Voormann. During the segment, Voormann discusses Harrison's practice of preparing the studio with incense to create a suitable environment, adding: [...] "He really made it into <b>a</b> <b>real</b> tranquil, <b>nice</b> surrounding – everybody felt just great." ...|$|R

I wonder," [...] he continued, thoughtfully gazing at the ceiling, [...] "if we was to fix up a Christmas tree--and you and me's {{got a lot of}} pretty things that we've picked up all over the world, that would go miles ahead of {{anything}} that could be bought at the store fer Christmas trees--if we was to fix up <b>a</b> tree <b>real</b> <b>nice,</b> if we couldn't get some child or other that wasn't likely to have a tree to come in and look at it, and stay awhile, and make Christmas more like Christmas. And then, when it went away, it could take along the things that was hangin' on the tree, and keep 'em fer its own." ...|$|R
500|$|When {{the pair}} {{decided to make}} [...] "This Was <b>a</b> <b>Real</b> <b>Nice</b> Clambake" [...] into an {{ensemble}} number, Hammerstein realized {{he had no idea}} what a clambake was like, and researched the matter. [...] Based on his initial findings, he wrote the line, [...] "First came codfish chowder". [...] However, further research convinced him the proper term was [...] "codhead chowder", a term unfamiliar to many playgoers. [...] He decided to keep it as [...] "codfish". [...] When the song proceeded to discuss the lobsters consumed at the feast, Hammerstein wrote the line [...] "We slit 'em down the back/And peppered 'em good". [...] He was grieved to hear from a friend that lobsters are always slit down the front. [...] The lyricist sent a researcher to a seafood restaurant and heard back that lobsters are always slit down the back. [...] Hammerstein concluded that there is disagreement about which side of a lobster is the back. [...] One error not caught involved the song [...] "June Is Bustin' Out All Over", in which sheep are depicted as seeking to mate in late spring—they actually do so in the winter. [...] Whenever this was brought to Hammerstein's attention, he told his informant that 1873 was a special year, in which sheep mated in the spring.|$|E
2500|$|Wills {{recalled}} {{the early days}} of what became known as Western swing music in a 1949 interview. [...] "Here's the way I figure it. We sure not tryin' to take credit for swingin' it." [...] Speaking of Milt Brown and himself working with songs done by Jimmie Davis, the Skillet Lickers, Jimmie Rodgers, and others, and songs he'd learned from his father, he said that [...] "We'd pull these tunes down an set 'em in a dance category. It wouldn't be a runaway, and just lay <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>nice</b> beat behind it an the people would get to really like it. It was nobody intended to start anything in the world. We was just tryin' to find enough tunes to keep 'em dancin' to not have to repeat so much." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kalish {{was one of}} New Jersey's top {{high school}} {{baseball}} players. Pitching and playing outfield as a four-year starter for Red Bank Catholic High School, he won all-conference and all-division honors. As a freshman in April 2003, in his first varsity pitching start, Kalish struck out ten batters in six innings. [...] As a sophomore, in May 2004 he pitched a seven-inning no-hitter. For the season, he batted [...]507 with 32 stolen bases, and on the mound he had a 6–1 won-lost record with a 1.60 ERA. In his senior season he hit [...]422 with 30 stolen bases. [...] Baseball America reported {{that it may be}} [...] "apocryphal", but that [...] "legend has it that Kalish didn't swing and miss at a single pitch as a high school senior." [...] Confirming that, Red Sox scout Ray Fagant, who followed him in high school, said: [...] "He went his entire senior year without a swing and miss once. He made hard contact every time." [...] He batted [...]466 in high school, leading his team in batting his last three years. [...] As a pitcher, he threw an 88–89mph fastball, and what his coach called [...] "a good curveball ... <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>nice</b> change-up", and had 190 career strikeouts.|$|E
5000|$|Stibbons {{appears in}} the video game Discworld II, in the High Energy Facility. He is {{characterized}} differently than in the books, as apparently the long hours of working with Hex's thaumic accelerator caused his brain to [...] "melt". This is evidenced by his erratic speech patterns and verbal tics, {{as well as his}} denials that he is being adversely affected: he reacts to Rincewind's remarks with [...] "There's no truth at all that splitting thaums causes the brain to *woof* melt! No truth at all! Haaaah! Every day, and in every way, I'm getting BETTER AND BETTER AND BETTER! They laughed at me and said I was mad, you know. HAVE A NICE DAY! HAVE A <b>NICE</b> DAY! HAVE <b>A</b> <b>REAL,</b> <b>REAL,</b> <b>REAL</b> <b>NICE</b> NIGHT-NO-DAY! HA HA HA HA HA!!!!!".|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{notion of}} a Frobenius {{manifold}} with <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>real</b> structure was introduced by Hertling. It is called CDV structure (Cecotti-Dubrovin-Vafa structure). In this paper, we introduce a “positivity condition ” on CDV structures and show that any Frobenius manifold of rank two with real spectrum can be equipped with a positive CDV structure. We extend naturally the symmetries of Frobenius structures given by Dubrovin to symmetries of CDV structures, which will play an important role. 1...|$|R

40|$|The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) {{promotes}} {{evidence-based medicine}} throughout contemporary health care. Its guidelines {{are employed in}} the United Kingdom and elsewhere, influencing the type and quality of health care provided. NICE considers a range of evidence {{in the process of}} creating guidelines; however, the research accepted as evidence greatly relies on positivist methodologies. At times, it is unnecessarily restricted to quantitative methods of data collection. Using the Clinical Guideline 140, opioids in palliative care, as an example, it is demonstrated that the research accepted as evidence is unable to provide answers to complex problems. In addition, several inherent biases are discussed, such as age inequality and pharmaceutical company influence. In order to provide coherent and useful guidelines relevant to complex problems in <b>a</b> <b>real</b> world setting, <b>NICE</b> must move away from focusing on data from randomised controlled trials. Its epistemological foundation must be questioned, paving the way for alternative research paradigms to be considered as evidence and thereby enriching subsequent guidelines...|$|R
