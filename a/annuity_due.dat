40|$|This paper {{includes}} couples on {{the demand}} side and analyses their implications {{on the problem}} of adverse selection in the annuity market. First, we examine the pooling equilibrium for individual-life annuities and show that in the presence of couples the rate of return on individuallife annuities is lower in case that couples do not have the advantage of joint consumption of "family public goods" as well as in case of a logarithmic utility function. Second, we examine the market for joint-life <b>annuities.</b> <b>Due</b> to their higher chance that only one partner survives to the retirement, couples with short-lived partners put more weight on the survivor benefit than couples with at least one longer-lived partner. This fact is used by annuity companies to separate couples according to their partners' life-expectancies. Hence, we find that only a separating equilibrium may exist. These results are obtained in a framework where couples are mandated to buy joint-life annuities and only single persons buy individual-life annuities. When relaxing this assumption by allowing couples to choose between individual- and joint-life annuities, we find that in equilibrium couples with long-lived partners buy individual-life annuities, while couples with short-lived partners buy joint-life annuities. However, couples with one long-lived and one short-lived partner may decide for either type of annuities, depending on the exogenous parameters. Accordingly, we identify two different types of equilibria. annuity market; uncertain lifetime; adverse selection; equilibrium...|$|R

40|$|A new {{explanation}} for the well-known reluctance of retirees to buy life <b>annuities</b> is <b>due</b> to Milevsky and Young (2002, 2003) : Since the decision to purchase longevity insurance is largely irreversible, in uncertain environments a real option to delay annuitization (RODA) generally has value. Milevsky and Young analytically identify and numerically estimate the RODA in a setting of constant relative risk aversion. This paper presents an extension {{to the case of}} HARA (or GLUM) preferences, the simplest representation of a consumption habit. The precise date of annuitization can no longer be ascertained with certainty in advance. This paper derives an approximation whereby the agent precommits. The effect of increasing the subsistence consumption rate on the timing of annuity purchase is similar to the effect of increasing the curvature parameter of the utility function. As in the CRRA case studied by Milevsky and Young, delayed annuitization is associated with optimistic predictions of the Sharpe ratio and divergence between annuity purchaser and provider predictions of mortality. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence against}} {{the hypothesis that}} elderly individuals with strong bequest motives purchase term life insurance to offset mandatory annuitization by the existing Social Security system. Using new data on elderly households, this study is able to examine ownership of pure term life insurance separately from whole life, or cash-value, policies. This is an important distinction in the Annuity Offset Model' because the central implication is that term insurance is purchased in order to undo' excessive government annuitization {{in the form of}} Social Security, while whole life policies among the elderly primarily consist of tax deferred savings. Evidence is presented that many households simultaneously choose to hold privately purchased annuities and term life insurance, a choice that is inconsistent with the notion that these individuals are over-annuitized. Results also indicate that the hypothesized positive relationship between term insurance ownership and Social Security benefits does not hold once one analyzes term separately from cash value policies. Previous empirical results appear to have been overly favorable to the <b>Annuity</b> Offset Model <b>due</b> to the inability to adequately account for the strong correlation between whole life insurance ownership and Social Security benefits, a correlation that can be attributed to tax-deferred savings and attempts to protect human capital during one's younger working life. Because these findings suggest that households are not seeking to undo' Social Security for bequest reasons, these results have implications for the current debate over annuitization options in an individual accounts retirement system. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} a special type of annuity where the annuity is issued to a policyholder {{who is in}} reasonable health at the outset; however, if the policyholder subsequently becomes disabled then the annuity payments are increased {{to a higher level}} depending on the level of disability. We analyse different types of disability-linked annuities, both single life and last survivor, in order to examine their main characteristics and assess their suitability as potential new products in the annuity and long term care (LTC) market. Initially, we use a central set of assumptions - in particular, incorporating the central set of morbidity trend assumptions used by Rickayzen and Walsh (2002) - to calculate various quantities. These include the expected times spent in different states of disability, the probabilities of each level of annuity enhancement eventually being triggered and the single premiums required. We then use pessimistic and optimistic assumptions to replicate the expansion and compression of morbidity theories, respectively, to provide a sensitivity analysis. In addition, we consider the effect of widening the definition of disability used for the product to make it more appealing to consumers. We also examine the underwriting considerations by calculating the theoretical premium which should be charged if a moderately disabled individual were to purchase the product. Finally, we estimate the potential market in the UK for this group of products. Our main conclusion is that when we compare the disability-linked annuity with the corresponding traditional whole life annuity, the increase in premium involved is relatively modest. The reasons for this are twofold. Firstly, the mortality and morbidity risks act in opposite directions. Therefore, an individual receiving an <b>annuity</b> enhancement <b>due</b> to severe disability will also face shorter life expectancy. Secondly, periods of disability are likely to occur towards the end of life. Therefore, the value of the annuity enhancements is relatively small since they are discounted so heavily. For similar reasons, we find that moving to optimistic or pessimistic morbidity assumptions has relatively little effect on the premiums. Finally, we note that the product is only likely to be affordable to the more affluent sector of the UK elderly population; nevertheless, we estimate that there is a considerable potential market for a product which appears to have many attractive features...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new evidence}} on the costs of purchasing private annuity contracts to spread a given stock of assets over an uncertain future lifetime. It also describes the operation of individual annuity arrangements within two large group retirement saving plans. First presents information on life annuity contracts that are now available in the individual single-premium-immediate annuity marketplace. For a 65 -year-old male annuity buyer present discounted value of the payouts offered by the average policy available in June 1998 was approximately 85 percent of the purchase price. This assumes that the individual faces the mortality risks of the average individual in the population, and that the payouts are discounted at a riskless interest rate. The expected present value of payouts rises {{if we assume that}} the buyer faces the mortality rates of the typical annuitant, while it declines if we assume a higher riskier, interest rate for discounting. Second, the paper considers individual annuity policies available to participants in the government's Thrift Savings Plan. Because these annuities are purchased through a large group retirement saving program, some of the administrative costs are lower than those in the national individual annuity market. The expected present value of payouts is correspondingly higher than that in the public' market. Third individual annuity products offered by TIAA-CREF, the retirement system for college and university employees. TIAA offers annuities with non-guaranteed elements the highest payouts in the individual <b>annuity</b> market, mainly <b>due</b> to superior investment returns and low expenses. CREF annuities offer valuable payouts that reflect basis, the investment experience of the accounts. ...|$|R

40|$|Tontines {{were once}} a popular type of mortality-linked {{investment}} pool. They promised enormous rewards to the last survivors {{at the expense of}} those died early. And, while this design appealed to the gambling instinc, it is a suboptimal way to generate retirement income. Indeed, actuarially-fair life annuities making constant payments [...] where the insurance company is exposed to longevity risk [...] induce greater lifetime utility. However, tontines {{do not have to be}} structured the historical way, i. e. with a constant cash flow shared amongst a shrinking group of survivors. Moreover, insurance companies do not sell actuarially-fair life <b>annuities,</b> in part <b>due</b> to aggregate longevity risk. We derive the tontine structure that maximizes lifetime utility. Technically speaking we solve the Euler-Lagrange equation and examine its sensitivity to (i.) the size of the tontine pool n, and (ii.) individual longevity risk aversion γ. We examine how the optimal tontine varies with γ and n, and prove some qualitative theorems about the optimal payout. Interestingly, Lorenzo de Tonti's original structure is optimal in the limit as longevity risk aversion γ→∞. We define the natural tontine as the function for which the payout declines in exact proportion to the survival probabilities, which we show is near-optimal for all γ and n. We conclude by comparing the utility of optimal tontines to the utility of loaded life annuities under reasonable demographic and economic conditions and find that the life annuity's advantage over the optimal tontine is minimal. In sum, this paper's contribution is to (i.) rekindle a discussion about a retirement income product that has been long neglected, and (ii.) leverage economic theory as well as tools from mathematical finance to design the next generation of tontine annuities.
