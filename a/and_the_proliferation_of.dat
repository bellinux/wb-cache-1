5|$|Advances in bioinformatics, {{refinements}} of DNA amplification, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> computational power {{have greatly}} aided {{the analysis of}} DNA sequences recovered from environmental samples, allowing the adaptation of shotgun sequencing to metagenomic samples (known also as whole metagenome shotgun or WMGS sequencing). The approach, used to sequence many cultured microorganisms and the human genome, randomly shears DNA, sequences many short sequences, and reconstructs them into a consensus sequence. Shotgun sequencing reveals genes present in environmental samples. Historically, clone libraries were used to facilitate this sequencing. However, with advances in high throughput sequencing technologies, the cloning step is no longer necessary and greater yields of sequencing data can be obtained without this labour-intensive bottleneck step. Shotgun metagenomics provides information both about which organisms are present and what metabolic processes are possible in the community. Because the collection of DNA from an environment is largely uncontrolled, the most abundant organisms in an environmental sample are most highly represented in the resulting sequence data. To achieve the high coverage needed to fully resolve the genomes of under-represented community members, large samples, often prohibitively so, are needed. On the other hand, the random nature of shotgun sequencing ensures {{that many of these}} organisms, which would otherwise go unnoticed using traditional culturing techniques, will be represented by at least some small sequence segments.|$|E
25|$|Intensive farming {{of turkeys}} {{from the late}} 1940s {{dramatically}} cut the price, making it more affordable for the working classes. With the availability of refrigeration, whole turkeys could be shipped frozen to distant markets. Later advances in disease control increased production even more. Advances in shipping, changing consumer preferences <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> commercial poultry plants has made fresh turkey inexpensive as well as readily available.|$|E

Renaissance artists subsequently used Pisanello's portrait of John {{almost as a}} stock type to represent exotic or antique figures. This {{can be seen in}} the work of Piero della Francesca who used the image of John in his Flagellation of Christ and Arezzo frescoes.|$|E

25|$|The North of London {{sets were}} {{intended}} to provide Regional Eurostar services from continental Europe to and from north of London, using the West Coast and East Coast Main Lines. These services never came to fruition because of long proposed journey times <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> budget airlines offering lower fares; there were also issues with the relatively crude design of British Rail overhead lines and with finding routes across London.|$|E
25|$|Rugby {{remained}} a sleepy country market town until the 19th {{century and the}} coming of the railways. In 1838 the London and Birmingham Railway was constructed past it, and in 1840 the Midland Counties Railway made a junction with the London and Birmingham at Rugby. Rugby became an important railway junction, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> rail yards and workshops attracted workers. Rugby's population grew from just 2,500 in 1835, to over 10,000 by the 1880s.|$|E
25|$|He and {{his wife}} Heidi Toffler, who collaborated with him {{for most of his}} writings, moved on to {{examining}} the reaction to changes in society with another best-selling book, The Third Wave in 1980. In it, he foresaw such technological advances as cloning, personal computers, the Internet, cable television and mobile communication. His later focus, via their other best-seller, Powershift, (1990), was on the increasing power of 21st-century military hardware <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> new technologies.|$|E

This allowed a new population distribution that encouraged urban development <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> farms in rural areas, {{as opposed to the}} pattern of feudalism dominant in the rest of Europe. The farmers practiced intensive irrigation-based agriculture, while artisanry and trade flourished in the cities—leading to prosperity and an era of peace in the province.|$|E

However, with the erosion of Cold War tensions, waning American hegemonic interests in the region, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> democracy throughout Latin America Canada saw the increasing importance of the OAS as a unifying institution.|$|E
25|$|The {{historic}} {{character of}} {{the city has been}} challenged in recent decades by skyrocketing property values <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> second homes, increasingly shutting low- and middle-income workers out of the city and creating a large pool of commuters from nearby bedroom communities such as Snowmass, Basalt, Carbondale, and Glenwood Springs. At the same time, in stark contrast to its historic character, the city has emerged into international fame as a glitzy playground of the wealthy and famous. Aspen has become a second and third home to many international jet setters.|$|E

25|$|This {{subspecies}} of butterfly faces declining habitat {{which has}} contributed to its placement onto the list of federally threatened species. Like other endangered and threatened species of butterflies, {{in and around the}} Bay Area, the checkerspot is faced with rapid human development of areas once considered prime habitat. Development <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> invasive species, exotic non-natives that naturalize in the area, are two of the three most grave threats to this and several other species of butterfly. The greatest threat to the butterfly is likely the increasing emission of nitrogen in California.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 10th century, {{commodity}} markets grew as a mechanism for allocating goods, labor, land and capital across Europe. Between the late 11th and the late 13th century, English urbanization, regional specialization, expanded and improved infrastructure, {{the increased use of}} coinage <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> markets and fairs were evidence of commercialization. The spread of markets is illustrated by the 1466 installation of reliable scales in the villages of Sloten and Osdorp so villagers no longer had to travel to Haarlem or Amsterdam to weigh their locally produced cheese and butter.|$|E
25|$|Burundi {{is one of}} the world's poorest countries, owing in part to its {{landlocked}} geography, poor legal system, lack {{of economic}} freedom, lack of access to education <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>proliferation</b> <b>of</b> HIV/AIDS. Approximately 80% of Burundi's population lives in poverty. Famines and food shortages have occurred throughout Burundi, most notably in the 20th century, and according to the World Food Programme, 56.8% of children under age five suffer from chronic malnutrition. One scientific study of 178 nations rated Burundi's population as having the lowest satisfaction with life in the world. As a result of deep poverty, Burundi is dependent on foreign aid.|$|E

25|$|The {{city that}} is now Antalya was first settled around 200 BC by the Attalid dynasty of Pergamon, which was soon subdued by the Romans.
