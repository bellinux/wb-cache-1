The hijra form a third gender role, although they do not enjoy the same acceptance and respect as males and females in their cultures. They can run their own households, and their occupations <b>are</b> <b>singing</b> and dancing, working as cooks or servants, sometimes prostitutes, or long-term sexual partners with men.

25|$|The {{speaking}} dialect or accent of {{a person}} may differ greatly from the general singing accent that a person uses while singing. When people sing, they generally use the accent or neutral accent that {{is used in the}} style of music they <b>are</b> <b>singing</b> in, rather than a regional accent or dialect; the style of music and the popular center/region of the style has more influence on the singing accent {{of a person}} than where they come from. For example, in the English language, British singers of rock or popular music often sing in an American accent or neutral accent instead of an English accent.|$|E
25|$|Some {{consider}} that singing {{is not a}} natural process but is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes, but others {{consider that}} some ways of singing {{can be considered as}} natural. Singing does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises. Voice teachers instruct their students to exercise their voices in an intelligent manner. Singers should be thinking constantly about the kind of sound they are making and the kind of sensations they are feeling while they <b>are</b> <b>singing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Translations of sung texts—whether of {{the above}} type meant to be sung or of {{a more or less}} literal type meant to be read—are also used as aids to audiences, singers and conductors, when a work is being sung in a {{language}} not known to them. The most familiar types are translations presented as subtitles or surtitles projected during opera performances, those inserted into concert programs, and those that accompany commercial audio CDs of vocal music. In addition, professional and amateur singers often sing works in languages they do not know (or do not know well), and translations are then used to enable them to understand the meaning of the words they <b>are</b> <b>singing.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{consists}} of a simplistic concept [...] a One Direction recording session. In a November 2012 interview with MTV News, Arnell {{said he did not}} want to make it about anything more than that, [...] "When I first heard the track, the mix on it was so simple and so pure and you could hear all the qualities of the voices on the track, I just wanted to come up with something that when the viewer watched it, it was almost like sitting there listening to the boys sing the track." [...] Arnell subsequently developed the idea of a recording studio setting, thinking that it was [...] "the most pure way to do it". He wanted to make the music video as [...] "uncontrived as possible" [...] without [...] "any other bullsh-- or effects in the way of it." [...] While Arnell conceded that music video may seem like a simple concept, the shoot itself took over twelve hours to complete and said that it was [...] "one of the hardest things I've ever done." [...] The group performed it [...] "over and over again because I was just trying to get different shots, different angles, different qualities." [...] As for the decision to shoot the video in black-and-white, Arnell felt it best captured the essence of the ballad. He also noted that was his intention to give the music video the feeling as if One Direction <b>are</b> <b>singing</b> it right to you, [...] "It's purely about the clarity of it. When you sit there watching it, it's almost like these little bits of eye contact [...] you really feel like the guys <b>are</b> <b>singing</b> it to you." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{previous}} Sleater-Kinney albums, {{most of the}} lyrical themes on The Hot Rock {{are more}} intimate, exploring failed relationships and personal uncertainty. As Weiss recalled, the songs are [...] "really honest, even if they're sometimes unpleasant. The lyrics evoke so many emotions. Our analogies are visual and the metaphors are direct. Corin and Carrie <b>are</b> <b>singing</b> about things they care about". The album features a notable amount of vocal and guitar interplay between Tucker and Brownstein, who interweave their voices and play off each other to create very atmospheric songs such as [...] "The End of You" [...] and [...] "Burn Don't Freeze". Music critic Robert Christgau said that [...] "even reading the booklet it's hard {{to keep track of}} who's saying what to whom about what, as if they'd fallen in love with (or to) the Velvets' 'Murder Mystery'".|$|E

Usually the slower paced songs <b>are</b> <b>sung</b> in the beginning and progressively faster songs <b>are</b> <b>sung</b> as the gourd dance progresses. When the gourd dance draws to a close, a fast song is usually the last to be performed, {{but it is not}} the [...] "official" [...] closing song.

500|$|The {{song that}} the sirens <b>are</b> <b>singing</b> {{in the first}} segment is a parody on the 1978 disco song [...] "Copacabana" [...] by Barry Manilow.

In the second segment, the captain {{resembling}} Chief Wiggum is initially leading the French army. The soldier resembling Lou {{points out that the}} captain [...] "keeps switching back from French and English." [...] The scene satirizes films like Doctor Zhivago in which the Russians speak with a British accent even though they are in Russia. At the end of the act, Marge can be seen eating the page which shows Joan's demise and, say [...] "Well, it's easier to chew than that Bambi video." [...] The scene is a reference to a scene in the Disney film Bambi, in which Bambi's mother is shot to death by hunters.|$|E

Staff and guests (including Lisa) of Kellerman's <b>are</b> <b>singing</b> the closing song together when {{the door opens and}} Johnny walks in. He's returned to do the last dance of the season. Johnny leads Baby onstage, interrupting the show which is already in progress. He makes a brief speech about how [...] "Frances" [...] has made him a better man. Baby and Johnny dance a more provocative version of their mambo duet, and the other [...] "dirty dancers" [...] join in. Baby runs to Johnny and executes the elusive lift move they'd practiced. The dirty dancers pull guests from their seats to join in the celebration. Jake apologizes to Johnny for thinking he got Penny pregnant, and reconciles with Baby. The film ends with the entire cast dancing joyously to [...] "(I've Had) The Time of My Life".|$|E
500|$|The {{music of}} Parasakthi was {{composed}} by R. Sudarsanam. The lyrics {{were written by}} Bharathidasan, Subramania Bharati, M. Karunanidhi, Annal Thango, Udumalai Narayana Kavi and K. P.

Relatively higher importance {{was given to the}} film's dialogues over its music, so the dialogues were sold separately on audio cassettes. Some of the numbers from Parasakthi were based on songs from Hindi films; one was a rehash from the Urdu film Akeli (1952). The number [...] "O Rasikkum Seemane" [...] inspired [...] "Itai Tazhukikkolla" [...] from Periyar (2007). The 2010 film Rasikkum Seemane borrows its title from the song of the same name. Annadurai is referenced in the number [...] "Kaa Kaa Kaa", in the line [...] "Kaakai Annave neengal azhagaana vaayaal pannaga paadureenga", which translates to [...] "Crow elder, you <b>are</b> <b>singing</b> so melodiously with your beautiful mouth". It was written by Narayana Kavi. [...] "Poomalai" [...] is based on the Urdu song [...] "Sanwariya, Tohe Koi Pukare" [...] from the Pakistani film Dupatta (1952).
