40|$|Abstract – The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the main differences in the genetic control of the iron concentration in Mesoamerican and <b>Andean</b> <b>common</b> bean seeds, in early generations, and to select recombinants with a high iron concentration in the seeds. F 1, F 1 reciprocal, F 2, F 2 reciprocal, and backcross (BC 11 and BC 12) generations were produced by crosses between Mesoamerican (CNFP 10104 x CHC 01 ‑ 175) and Andean (Cal 96 x Hooter) inbred lines. The expression of significant maternal effect was observed for the Mesoamerican gene pool. Iron concentration was higher in the seed coat of Mesoamerican common bean seeds (54. 61 to 67. 92 %) and in the embryo of <b>Andean</b> <b>common</b> bean seeds (69. 40 to 73. 44 %). High broad‑sense heritability was obtained for iron concentration in Mesoamerican and <b>Andean</b> <b>common</b> bean seeds.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The genetic {{parameter}} {{estimates of}} the iron and zinc concentrations in <b>Andean</b> <b>common</b> bean seeds were obtained using the IAC Boreal × Light Red Kidney and Ouro Branco × Light Red Kidney crosses. The parents and the F 1, F 1 reciprocal, F 2, F 2 reciprocal, and backcross BC 11 and BC 12 generations were evaluated in a field experiment that {{was carried out in}} the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The iron concentration in <b>Andean</b> <b>common</b> bean seeds ranged from 24. 70 to 102. 40 mg kg- 1 dry matter (DM), the zinc concentration ranged from 10. 73 to 37. 50 mg kg- 1 DM, and no significant maternal effect was observed. The narrow-sense heritability ranged from low (h 2 n= 19. 04 %) to high (h 2 n= 63. 60 %) for the concentrations of iron and zinc, respectively. Hybrid vigor and transgressive segregation were observed for the iron and zinc concentrations in <b>Andean</b> <b>common</b> bean seeds. In the hybrid combination IAC Boreal × Light Red Kidney, it was possible to select recombinants for the iron and zinc biofortification program. From the tested hybrid combinations, recombinants with low iron and zinc concentrations in seeds could be selected to use when the diet needs to be restricted in those minerals...|$|R

The correct {{application}} of the Communitarian Law produced by an International Integration Organization implies that States Members have to make political and legal internal reforms. However, those obligations are not always undertaken by the States and, therefore, {{the goals of the}} integration process cannot be reached. As 2005 was very crucial for the conformation of the <b>Andean</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Market,</b> it is quite important to study the different mechanisms for {{application of}} the Communitarian Law within the Member States and the comparison of them with those of the successful European Union experience. This historical context is the frame within which we are going to undertake the study and investigation of the political and legal reforms that facilitate the application of Andean Communitarian Law made by Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. This research is not going to consider the case of Colombia because that issue is being addressed in other broader and deeper academic investigation...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{surge of}} {{industrial}} exports from some Latin American countries has prompted {{a number of}} studies which have examined the new outward-looking strategies of a few nations such as Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. There are, however, at least two characteristics which do not apply to most other countries of the Southern Hemisphere of the Americas. First, export diversification in the large nation states began only after import substitution had run its course and seemed to be exhausted. Secondly, in spite of their importance for the balance of payments, exports contribute a relatively small part to the formation of the gross national products in these countries. Hence industrialization will depend on the expansion of domestic markets. This situation is already quite different in the Andean countries, where import substitution industrialization was not only hampered by small and fragmented markets but also by lower per capita income and more widespread poverty. To overcome this handicap Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and later Venezuela have joined in the <b>Andean</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Market.</b> Simultaneously they have promoted industrial exports the results of which have been modest except in the case of Colombia. Unless one includes Peru's fishmeal into industrial exports, only Chile and Colombia have been able to raise the share of manufactured goods in total exports beyond 10 %. But whereas industrial exports' share has been falling considerably in Chile in the last few years, Colombia was able to raise that share from less than 2 % in 1960 to over 15 % in 1973. ...|$|E
40|$|From the introduction). The {{promotion}} of regional integration {{is one of}} the more significant decisions in the post-WW II international political economy. Regional integration is a process in which two or more nations within a geographical region voluntarily adjust economic and other policies to produce a fusion of their economies and political institutions. This results in a slow pooling of nation-state sovereignty in evolving supranational institutions. The variation of this pooling is wide. Large amounts of sovereignty to date have already been pooled by Western European countries in the European Union (EU). At the opposite end of spectrum, we see nations of Latin America and the Caribbean in the same process but not having reached the same level of regional integration. The purpose of this paper is to explore the conditions conducive to regional economic integration in Latin America and the Caribbean. A review of the literature points to two fundamental conditions: domestic and regional. These conditions comprise the incentives and the disincentives for the propensity of country pairs to integrate. We examine Latin American and Caribbean integration for three reasons. First, we wish to explore the dynamics of the process of integration in the developing world. Second, the western hemisphere is a unique laboratory for integration. In the latter half of the twentieth century, four regional economic integration projects emerged in Latin America and the Caribbean: the Southern Cone Common Market (Mercosur in Spanish or Mercosul in Portuguese); the <b>Andean</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Market</b> (also known as the Andean Pact); the Central American Common Market (CACM), which later became the Central American Integration System (SICA); and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). (1) Due to the longevity of some projects, the off-again and on-again traits of others, the uneven pace of development of regional institutions, and the mix of different sized countries, we have a variation along many dimensions. Third, the recent discussions for the resurrection of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) warrant an examination...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theory of}} the endogenous formation of a <b>common</b> <b>market</b> in a three-country, n factor political economy model. Ex ante policies {{in each of the}} prospective members are the result of direct democracy, and equilibrium outcomes may include both import restrictions as well as subsidies. The decision to join a <b>common</b> <b>market</b> is modelled as a simultaneous move game between the two prospective members. Several interesting results emerge. First, ex ante differences in subsidies do not affect the attitude of the median voter. Second, for a <b>common</b> <b>market</b> to emerge, ex post factor flows between prospective members have to be balanced. Third, the likelihood that a <b>common</b> <b>market</b> emerges increases with the number of factors enjoying ex post enhanced protection. This last result highlights the potential tension between social desirability and political feasibility of the <b>common</b> <b>market.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a setting of two firms and one capacity agent. Each firm serves a primary market, {{and the capacity}} agent sustains a <b>common</b> <b>market</b> to draw demand for capacity from the external firms. The firms can partner with the capacity agent under her contract to serve the <b>common</b> <b>market.</b> When they use the <b>common</b> <b>market</b> mainly as an outlet for their unused capacities, the capacity agent will only specify a variable fee for each capacity unit deployed through her, and prefer to partner with one firm in most circumstances. When the firms adjust capacities to accommodate the businesses created by serving the <b>common</b> <b>market,</b> the capacity agent will specify a lump-sum payment and a variable fee, and {{will be more likely}} to incentivize only one firm to partner with her, when the <b>common</b> <b>market</b> is sufficiently large or the demands in the <b>common</b> and primary <b>markets</b> are strongly correlated.

40|$|Economic theory {{suggests}} that a <b>common</b> <b>market</b> between two or more countries improves overall well-being, but it creates winners and losers in each country. Recent empirical findings also show that the overall impact of a <b>common</b> <b>market</b> on per capita income depends on the similarity of economic development between member countries. A <b>common</b> <b>market</b> among developed countries results in the convergence of per capita income while a <b>common</b> <b>market</b> among developing countries results in the divergence of per capita income. The difference in outcome, some economists suggest, is due to variations in comparative advantage between member states {{and the rest of}} the world. But the theory of comparative advantage does not fully explain the results of the de facto <b>common</b> <b>market</b> between Ethiopia and Eritrea (1991 - 1998).
