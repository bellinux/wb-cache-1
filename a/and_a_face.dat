5|$|By the 5thcentury, the Romans had {{withdrawn}} from Britain, and the Angles and the Saxons settled. A heptarchy of new kingdoms began to emerge. One {{of the methods}} used by regional kings to solidify their authority over their territories {{was the use of}} ceremony and insignia. The tomb of an unknown king– evidence suggests it may be Rædwald of East Anglia– at Sutton Hoo provides insight into the regalia of a pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon king. Inside the early 7th-century tomb discovered in 1939 was found the ornate Sutton Hoo helmet, comprising an iron cap, a neck guard, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>face</b> mask, decorated with images of animals and warriors in copper-alloy and set with garnets. He was also buried with a heavy whetstone sceptre, on top of which is an iron ring surmounted by the figure of a stag; a decorated sword; and a ceremonial shield.|$|E

25|$|A Player scoring no pins after bowling three {{balls in}} the leg is known as scoring a 'Spider'. A spider is {{recorded}} by drawing legs <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>face</b> onto the zero {{on the board and}} is greeted with delight when the opposing team returns to the alley. A 'Spare' where the pins are reset after being felled with balls to spare is denoted on the board by a circle drawn around the score. This is not greeted so favourably. The maximum score in a 9-pin frame is 27, however this is virtually unheard of, the highest spare {{in the history of the}} Worcester and District was thought to be a 24 scored by Gary Sandbrook whilst playing for the Independents Skittle team in the early 1990s, the highest spare in the friendly league was achieved by Scott Heywood with a full house score of 27 at the Alma tavern whilst playing for the Rushwick Cavalier on 18 September 2014. Spares are not uncommon however, and a good score in the Worcester game is 40 plus.|$|E

2500|$|Vertex {{coloring}} is {{the starting}} point of the subject, and other coloring problems can be transformed into a vertex version. For example, an edge coloring of a graph is just a vertex coloring of its line graph, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>face</b> coloring of a plane graph is just a vertex coloring of its dual. However, non-vertex coloring problems are often stated and studied as is. [...] That is partly for perspective, and partly because some problems are best studied in non-vertex form, as for instance is edge coloring.|$|E
2500|$|In graph theory, graph {{coloring}} is {{a special}} case of graph labeling; it is an assignment of labels traditionally called [...] "colors" [...] to elements of a graph subject to certain constraints. In its simplest form, {{it is a way}} of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color; this is called a vertex coloring. Similarly, an edge coloring assigns a color to each edge so that no two adjacent edges share the same color, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>face</b> coloring of a planar graph assigns a color to each face or region so that no two faces that share a boundary have the same color.|$|E
