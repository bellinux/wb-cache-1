Additionally, P₃Nb(ODipp) ₂(py) ₂, prepared from [Na(THF) ₃][[P₃Nb(ODipp) ₃] {{in the presence of}} pyridine and salts of coordinating cations, was found to successfully produce AsP₃ upon treatment with <b>AsCl₃</b> Dimer [P₂Nb(ODipp) ₃]₂ has been obtained via a novel " 2 (3 - 1) " synthetic strategy. The mononuclear diphosphorus complex P₂Nb(ODipp) ₃ proposed to be generated transiently by formal P- abstraction from previously reported [Na(THF) ₃][P₃Nb(ODipp) ₃] undergoes irreversible dimerization to form the [P₂Nb(ODipp) ₃]₂ complex, and is alternatively trapped reversibly by a 1, 3 -cyclohexadiene (CHD) to form in situ C₆H₈P₂Nb(ODipp) ₃ Unprotected dibenzo- 7 [lambda]³A 3 -phosphanorbornadiene derivatives RPA (A= C₁₄H₁₀ or anthracene; R = tBu, dbabh, HMDS, iPr₂N, cis-Me₂ Pip, Cy₂N, Me₂N) were synthesized by treatment of the corresponding phosphorus dichloride RPCl₂ with MgA- 3 THF. Thermolysis of RPA benzene-d₆ solutions leads to anthracene extrusion. Experimental and computational thermodynamic activation parameters suggest this process occurs through the intermediacy of a singlet phosphinidene for the iPr₂N derivative. The [RP] unit could be transferred to CHD, a carbene and an ortho-benzoquinone, with formation of the corresponding anti- 7 -phosphanorbornene, phosphaalkene and phospholane. The anthracene diphosphorus adduct P₂A₂ was synthesized from Me₂NPA, through isolated intermediates CIPA and [P₂A₂Cl][AlCl₄]. P₂A₂ was found to transfer P₂ efficiently to N-₃ CHD, 1, 3 -butadiene and (C₂H₄) Pt(PPh₃) ₂ to form 1, 2 -cyclo-[P₂N₃]-, P₂(CHD) ₂, P₂(BD) ₂ and (P₂) [Pt(PPh₃) ₂]₂. A complete kinetic and computational study of the P₂(CHD) ₂ formation from P₂A₂ suggests P₂ is a productive intermediate in solution. Additionally, a molecular beam mass spectrometry study on the thermolysis of solid P₂A₂ reveals the direct detection of molecular fragments of only P₂ and anthracene thus establishing a link between solution-phase P₂-transfer chemistry and production of gas-phase P₂ by mild thermal activation of a molecular precursor. The HCP precursor Ph₃PC(H) PA was synthesized directly from C 1 PA. The activation of P₄ with [Na][SnPh₃] and sodium naphthalenide led to the synthesis of phosphide compounds [Na(benzo- 15 -crown- 5) ][P(SnPh₃) ₂], P(SnPh₃) ₃, (XL) ₂InP(SnPh₃) ₂, (Ph₃P) AuP(SnPh₃) ₂, P₇(SnPh₃) ₃ and P 7 (SiMe₃) ₃, characterized using a variety of techniques. by Alexandra Velian.
