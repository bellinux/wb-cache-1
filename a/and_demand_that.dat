5|$|Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB) agents Dave Norton and Steve Haines contact Michael <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> <b>that</b> he {{perform a}} series of {{operations}} to undermine a rival agency, the International Affairs Agency (IAA). Under Steve's direction and with Lester's help, they attack an armoured convoy carrying funds intended for the IAA and steal an experimental chemical weapon from an IAA-controlled lab. As Steve comes under increasing scrutiny, he forces Michael and Franklin to erase any evidence being used against him from the FIB servers. Michael takes the opportunity to wipe the data on his own activities, destroying Steve's leverage over him. Michael, Trevor, Franklin, and Lester start planning their most daring feat ever: raiding the Union Depository's gold bullion reserve.|$|E
5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) asks Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) to {{accompany}} him to the Six Sigmas Retreat in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, following his Bush administration and CEO debacles. There, Jack meets with the Six Sigmas, six men who each embody a core feature of Six Sigma: teamwork, insight, brutality, male enhancement, hand-shake-fulness and play-hard. They disapprove of Liz's antics during the team building exercises <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> <b>that</b> Jack distance himself from her {{if he wants to}} succeed, which he does. Before his dinner speech, Jack psyches himself up in the men's room, completely forgetting that he is wearing a microphone and that everyone can hear him. Liz quickly takes the stage to draw attention away from Jack's embarrassment and finally ends up ripping her blouse open and dancing in front of everyone. She succeeds, and is banned from the retreat forever.|$|E
5|$|Kurt is menaced {{by school}} bully Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) and badly shaken; while Sue sympathizes with Kurt's plight, she can only punish Karofsky if he {{physically}} attacks Kurt. Glee club co-captain Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) convinces the glee club girls {{to have their}} football-playing boyfriends defend Kurt, but her own boyfriend, Finn, refuses, concerned that it may jeopardize his position as quarterback. Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale), Noah Puckerman (Mark Salling) and Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) do confront Karofsky, <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> <b>that</b> he leave Kurt alone. Karofsky retaliates, and Sam defends them by fighting with him. Quinn is impressed by Sam's actions, and decides to accept his promise ring. Karofsky later sees Kurt and Finn practicing a wedding dance and taunts {{them in front of}} Burt. Burt is angered by this, but becomes livid when Kurt admits that Karofsky has threatened to kill him. He instigates a meeting with Sue, Karofsky's father (Daniel Roebuck) and the two boys, at which Sue expels Karofsky.|$|E

25|$|The 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic of the United Nations {{considers}} a bicycle to be a vehicle, {{and a person}} controlling a bicycle (whether actually riding or not) is considered an operator.

25|$|Russia's foreign {{broadcasting}} service, RT, has {{postulated that}} NATO intervention {{may have been}} motivated by Gaddafi's attempts to establish a unified federation of African states that would use the gold dinar as its currency <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> <b>that</b> foreign importers of African oil pay in gold. Despite its stated opposition to NATO intervention, Russia abstained from voting on Resolution 1973 instead of exercising its veto power as a permanent member of the Security Council; four other powerful nations also abstained from the vote—India, China, Germany, and Brazil—but of that group only China has the same veto power.|$|E
25|$|This impasse {{continued}} {{for nearly a}} century until the Movellans finally develop a weapon capable of breaking it – a highly virulent biological agent that targets Daleks. In Resurrection of the Daleks (1984), having lost the war, the Daleks rescue Davros from the human prison station where he had been frozen for ninety years <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> <b>that</b> he develop a defence against the disease. This time, it is Davros who double-crosses the Daleks, deciding to take personal command of the Dalek race rather than merely serving it. Davros' continuing influence eventually leads to a schism among the Daleks, with one faction following Davros' leadership and another rejecting their creator to instead follow the Supreme Dalek.|$|E

25|$|Many growers {{gave up on}} winemaking, {{and instead}} chose to plant {{orchards}} and alfalfa fields to feed the growing ostrich feather industry. The growers that did replant with grapevines chose high-yielding grape varieties such as Cinsaut. By the early 1900s, more than 80 million vines had been replanted, creating a wine lake. Some producers would pour unsaleable wine into local rivers and streams. The imbalance between supply <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> <b>that</b> caused depressed prices prompted the South African government to fund {{the formation of the}} Koöperatieve Wijnbouwers Vereniging van Zuid-Afrika Bpkt (KWV) in 1918. Started as a co-operative, the KWV soon grew in power and prominence eventually setting policies and prices for the entire South African wine industry. To deal with the wine glut, the KWV restricted yields and set minimum prices that encouraged the production of brandy and fortified wines.|$|E
25|$|If a {{criminal}} {{could make it}} to a church, he was given sanctuary. This was a recognition that the Church was a separate jurisdiction. Some law allowed for the criminal to be housed and fed by the clergy for seven days. Bracton recommends 40 days. After this, the reeve would {{knock on the door}} of the church <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> <b>that</b> the criminal surrender himself or take the shortest road to a seaport and leave England never to return. If he did not leave the church, he was to be starved. If the criminal stayed on the road to the seaport, he was to be left unharmed. If he went off the road, he could be killed by the population at large. Condemned criminals and those found with stolen goods were not to be given sanctuary. The wife of such was declared a widow and all lands owned by him were escheated to the Crown.|$|E
25|$|The Battle for the Plinth ensues, and the Wildwood Irregulars {{are near}} defeat. As Alexandra prepares {{to carry out}} the sacrifice, Iphigenia confronts her.

The battle turns against the coyote army, but Prue discovers that she can control plants the way the Mystics can and uses her new skill to make the tree boughs snatch Mac from Alexandra. Brendan shoots Alexandra with an arrow and the Ivy consumes her. Brendan now in command of the ivy is told by Iphigenia to make it sleep, and he does so. The victorious Wildwood Irregulars regroup and press on to the gates of South Wood <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> <b>that</b> the corrupt government resign.

25|$|The film flashes back to 21 {{years earlier}} during {{military}} era as Tamuno narrates their ordeal {{to the public}} via Kristy's camera. Ebiere (Mbong Amata) is born in Warri during the Military era; she concludes high school and is offered scholarship by Western Oil to study oversea. A few years later, an oil pipe in the Niger Delta bursts {{and the people of}} the community go to fetch petrol from the pipe, Dede (Hakeem Kae-Kazim), a fisherman discovers that fishes in the river have been killed by the oil spillage. The police arrive at the spillage site <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> <b>that</b> the Villagers vacate the area, but no one listens to them. Ebiere arrives in the village — her home, and is told her mother and siblings are getting fuel from a spillage site. On her way to the site, the site explodes killing her mother and siblings. The explosion appears to have been an accident, caused after one of the police officers sent to disperse the oil collectors lights a cigarette after having failed to do so. He is killed as well. Ebiere speaks up at a consolation visit of Western Oil staff (An oil rig American company based in Warri) and is applauded by members of the Community. This establishes her as one of the speakers for the Niger Delta Community, she is approached by Kate Summers (Sarah Wayne Callies), a reporter who likes her speech and says Ebiere is {{different from the rest of}} the community people, Kate becomes one of Ebiere's friends and supporters. Ebiere starts to organize peaceful protests and mass rallies for their voice to be heard, fighting for the Niger Delta to be cleaned up and well maintained — they are sometimes beaten, killed and/or arrested by the Military in the process. Ebiere is offered bribes severally by Western Oil representatives to stop her from instigating the people, but she always declines.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the 1937–1938 cricket season, it was {{expected}} that Nash would be chosen for the 1938 Ashes Tour, with one journalist stating that if he was not selected, the team [...] "would not be truly representative of our nation's real cricketing strength." [...] Nash continued to terrorise batsmen in district cricket, including the rare occurrence of taking all 10 wickets in an innings (for 35 runs) for South Melbourne against Prahran in 1937–38, but was not selected for Victoria throughout the season. Nash's non-selection for Victoria led some Victorian Cricket Association delegates to publicly question why [...] "the best fast bowler in Australia, and probably the world, is not chosen to represent Victoria" [...] <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> <b>that</b> the Victorian selectors explain their non-selection of Nash.|$|E

500|$|The 1832 Royal Commission {{into the}} Operation of the Poor Laws {{was set up}} {{following}} the widespread destruction and machine breaking of the Swing Riots. The report was prepared by a commission of nine, including Nassau William Senior, and served by Edwin Chadwick as Secretary. The Royal Commission's primary concerns were with illegitimacy (or [...] "bastardy"), reflecting the influence of Malthusians, and the fear that the practices of the Old Poor Law were undermining {{the position of the}} independent labourer. [...] Two practices were of particular concern: the [...] "roundsman" [...] system, where overseers hired out paupers as cheap labour, and the Speenhamland system, which subsidised low wages without relief. The report concluded that the existing Poor Laws undermined the prosperity of the country by interfering with the natural laws of supply <b>and</b> <b>demand,</b> <b>that</b> the existing means of poor relief allowed employers to force down wages, and, that poverty itself was inevitable.|$|E
500|$|With {{the success}} of his lessons, Chalmers plans to take them all on a field trip to Springfield Forest, in which Roosevelt left one of his spectacles. The field trip does not go well, however, as Nelson breaks his arm when he tries to reach for the spectacles. Since it was an {{unauthorized}} field trip, Nelson's mother threatens to sue the school for medical expenses, which leads to Chalmers getting fired. In order to save Chalmers' job, Bart and his friends, who now go by the name [...] "The Brotherhood of the Spectacles", take over the school in a hostage situation and stand up for the teacher who made a meaningful impact to them. They lock all of the teachers out of the school <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> <b>that</b> Chalmers get reinstated. A SWAT team prepares to storm the school, before Chalmers walks up to convince Bart to stop. Luckily, Chief Wiggum accidentally drops his gun, knee-capping the school representative State Comptroller Atkins, who thereafter agrees to reinstate Chalmers because they can recover the money lost in the previous lawsuit with a new lawsuit against the police department.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the elected}} UFA members espoused radical {{political}} doctrines calculated {{to transform the}} provincial government. Brownlee quickly became identified with the caucus's conservative faction. At the caucus meeting that approved his appointment, he {{put an end to}} discussion of whether nominations for justices of the peace should come from UFA locals or its central political committee by asserting that they would continue to be handled by the office of the Attorney-General. [...] Later, many UFA MLAs argued that only motions explicitly declaring a lack of confidence in the government should be treated as motions of non-confidence. [...] They were concerned that supporters of the government who nonetheless disagreed with it on a specific issue might be pressured to refrain from voting their consciences on motions, such as money bills, that were conventionally considered tests of the government's confidence. [...] Brownlee warned these MLAs that regardless of their beliefs, the Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta was free to request the government's resignation any time he considered that it lacked or did not merit the legislature's confidence. [...] Despite this warning, UFA MLAs John Russell Love and Alex Moore proposed a resolution in the legislature changing the convention. The proposal attracted notice from across Canada; R. B. Bennett advised Brownlee, his former clerk, to warn Moore and Love that it was unconstitutional <b>and</b> <b>demand</b> <b>that</b> they withdraw it. Brownlee was reluctant to do so, since a similar proposal {{had been part of the}} UFA's election platform, and instead moved successful amendments weakening the motion to a vague [...] "statement of intent".|$|E
