5000|$|The Forrestal {{class was}} the first {{completed}} class of [...] "supercarriers" [...] of the Navy, so called because of their then-extraordinarily high tonnage (75,000 tons, 25% larger than the post-World War II-era [...] ), full integration of the angled deck, very large island, and most importantly their extremely strong air wing (80-100 jet aircraft, compared to 65-75 for the Midway class and fewer than 50 for the [...] ). [...] and [...] were laid down as <b>axial</b> <b>deck</b> carriers and converted to angled deck ships while under construction; [...] and [...] were laid down as angled deck ships and had various minor improvements compared to the first two. The most visible differences were between the first pair and second pair: Forrestal and Saratoga were completed with two island masts, an open fantail, and a larger flight deck segment forward of the port aircraft elevator; Ranger and Independence had a single island mast, a more closed fantail (as seen in all carriers since), and a smaller flight deck segment forward of the port aircraft elevator. Compared to the Midway class, the Forrestals were 100 ft longer and nearly 20 ft wider abeam, resulting in a far more stable and comfortable aircraft platform even in very rough weather. When commissioned, the Forrestal-class ships had the roomiest hangar decks and largest flight decks of any carrier ever built. Because of their immense size they were built to a new, deep-hulled design that incorporated the armored flight deck into the hull (previous American design practice was to design the flight deck as superstructure). This was a very similar structural design as used on British [...] "armored" [...] carriers, and {{grew out of the}} requirement for such a very large carrier, because carrying the strength deck at the flight deck level produced a stronger and lighter hull. The Midway-class ships sat very low in the water and were poor sea boats through their long careers; they were very wet forward and their aviation characteristics were poor. The deeper Forrestal hull allowed the ships more freeboard and better seakeeping. The Forrestal-class carriers, like the Midway class that preceded it, were designed with armored flight decks.Forrestal-class ships were the first examples of supercarriers and thus not quite a perfected design; their elevators in particular were badly arranged for aircraft handling. The portside elevator, a relic of the original axial-deck design, was especially poorly suited, as it was located at the fore end of the angled deck, in the landing path as well as the launch path of aircraft from the No. 3 and No. 4 catapults. The subsequent [...] moved the portside elevator to the aft end of the angle and reversed the position of the island and the second starboard elevator, vastly improving aircraft handling. The sponson-mounted guns suffered from poor range and complicated firing arcs, and were located in very wet and thus nearly useless positions in the bow and stern. They were removed after only a few years and were later replaced by missiles and much later by close-in weapon systems (CIWS). The aft guns in Forrestal lasted until the fire in 1967, then were removed and eventually replaced by missiles in the mid-70s.|$|E

50|$|Lake Champlain had {{a unique}} {{modernization}} history. She {{was the only}} Essex-class ship to receive the SCB-27 conversion, which was a rebuild of the superstructure, flight deck and other features, but not also receive the SCB-125 conversion, which would have given her an angled flight deck and hurricane bow. Therefore, she had {{the distinction of being}} the last operational US aircraft carrier with an <b>axial</b> flight <b>deck.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Kuznetsov {{class is}} {{classified}} as heavy aviation cruisers, reflecting their greater weight {{as well as the}} larger number of aircraft they can operate. In addition to helicopters, they are also capable of operating conventional fixed-wing aircraft like the Sukhoi Su-33 and the Mikoyan MiG-29K. The ships have an angled flight deck as well as an <b>axial</b> flight <b>deck</b> for takeoff. Since there is no catapult, a bow ski jump is used to assist takeoff. Kuznetsov also carries the P-700 Granit cruise missiles that form the main armament of the Kirov-class battlecruiser.|$|R
50|$|Centaur was {{completed}} with an <b>axial</b> flight <b>deck,</b> {{marked by a}} broken white line running {{down the middle of}} the entire length of the flight deck. She began her contractor's sea trials in March 1953 and commissioned on 17 September 1953. Her aviation facilities as completed included 2 x BH5 30,000 lb hydraulic catapults at the bow, six 30,000 lb arrestor wires, two 35,000 lb capacity aircraft lifts, measuring 54 x 44 ft forward and aft. Her single hangar measured 329 by 62 by 17.5 ft and she had stowage for 349,000 Impgal L of AVCAT and Avgas aviation fuel.|$|R
5000|$|HMS Centaur was {{the first}} of the four [...] light fleet {{carriers}} of the Royal Navy. She was the only ship of her class to be completed with the original design configuration of a straight <b>axial</b> flight <b>deck,</b> rather than the newly invented angled flight decks of her three later sister ships. She was laid down in 1944 in Belfast with the contract being awarded to Harland and Wolff but not launched until 22 April 1947 due to delays relating to the end of the war. She was commissioned on 1 September 1953, a gap of almost nine years from when she was laid down in 1944.|$|R
5000|$|... {{the first}} to be completed, was {{commissioned}} in 1954. The ship had an <b>axial</b> flight <b>deck</b> and was thus unsuitable for operating the jets then rapidly supplanting piston engine aircraft in the Fleet Air Arm. Centaur was commissioned in Belfast and after completing her sea trials, she then steamed into Portsmouth Dockyard and {{for the next six months}} in 1954 the ship underwent a substantial reconstruction to provide for an interim (angled at 4 degrees, and not sponsoned out) angled flight deck and low powered steam catapults. However, service in this new configuration did not last long and the ship was decommissioned in 1965, but used as a harbour accommodation ship for a further six years. Conversion to a [...] "commando carrier" [...] configuration was cancelled in 1966.|$|R
