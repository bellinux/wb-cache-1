The chronology is based on independent multi-parameter counting of <b>annual</b> <b>layers</b> using comprehensive high-resolution measurements available from the North Greenland Ice Core Project, NGRIP. These are measurements of visual stratigraphy, conductivity of the solid ice, electrolytical melt water conductivity and the concentration of Na+, Ca 2 +, SO 42 −, NO 3 −, NH 4 +.

40|$|The {{study of}} climate records in ice cores {{requires}} an accurate determination of <b>annual</b> <b>layering</b> within the cores {{in order to}} establish a depth-age relationship. Existing tools to delineate these <b>annual</b> <b>layers</b> are based on observations of changes in optical, chemical, and electromagnetic properties.

Therefore, the best estimates of <b>annual</b> <b>layering</b> are produced by analyzing a combination of measurable ice properties. We present a novel and complimentary elastic wave remote sensing method based on laser ultrasonics. This method is used to measure variations in ultrasonic wave arrival times and velocity along the core with millimeter resolution. The laser ultrasound system does not require contact with the ice core and is non-destructive. Custom optical windows allow the source and receiver lasers to be located outside the cold room, while the core is scanned by moving it with a computer-controlled stage. We present results from Antarctic firn and ice cores that lack visual evidence of a layered structure, but do show travel-time and velocity variations.

50|$|An <b>annual</b> <b>layer</b> can {{be highly}} visible because the {{particles}} washed into the layer in the spring when there is greater flow strength are much coarser than those deposited later in the year. This forms a pair of layers—one coarse and one fine—for each annual cycle. Varves form only in fresh or brackish water, because {{the high levels of}} salt in normal sea water coagulate the clay into coarse grains. Since the saline waters leave coarse particles all year, it is nearly impossible to distinguish the individual layers in salt waters. Indeed, clay flocculation occurs at high ionic strength due to the collapse of the clay electrical double layer (EDL), which decreases the electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged clay particles.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. This study tests novel {{methods for}} {{automatically}} identifying annual layers {{in a shallow}} Antarctic ice core (WDC 05 Q) using images that were collected with an optical scanner at the US National Ice Core Laboratory. A new method of optimized variance maximization (OVM) modeled the density-related changes in <b>annual</b> <b>layer</b> thickness directly from image variance. This was done by using multi-objective complex (MOCOM) parameter optimization to drive a low-pass filtering scheme. The OVM-derived changes in <b>annual</b> <b>layer</b> thickness corresponded well {{with the results of}} an independent glaciochemical interpretation of the core. Individual annual cycles in image brightness were then identified by using OVM results to apply a depth-varying low-pass filter and fitting a second-order polynomial to a locally detrended neighborhood. The resulting map of annual cycles agreed to within 1 % of the overall annual count of the glaciochemical interpretation. Agreement on the presence of specific <b>annual</b> <b>layer</b> features was 96 %.

40|$|Abstract. As part of {{the effort}} to create the new Greenland Ice Core Chronology 2005 (GICC 05) a {{synchronized}} stratigraphical timescale for the Holocene parts of the DYE- 3, GRIP and NGRIP ice cores is made by using volcanic reference horizons in electri-cal conductivity measurements to match the cores. The main <b>annual</b> <b>layer</b> counting is carried out on the most suited records only, exploit-ing that the three ice cores have been drilled at locations with different climatic con-ditions and differences in ice flow. However, supplemental counting on data from all cores has been performed between each set of reference horizons in order to verify the valid-ity of the match. After the verification, the main dating is transferred to all records us-ing the volcanic reference horizons as tie points. An assessment of the mean <b>annual</b> <b>layer</b> thickness in each core section confirms that the new synchronized dating is consistent for all three cores. The data used for the main <b>annual</b> <b>layer</b> counting of the past 7900 years are the DYE- 3, GRIP and NGRIP stable isotope records. As the high accumulation rate at the DYE- 3 drill site makes the seasonal cycle in the DYE- 3 stable isotopes very resistant to firn diffusion, an effort has been made to extend the DYE- 3 Holocene record. The new syn-chronized dating relies heavily on this record of ∼ 75, 000 stable isotope samples. The dat-ing of the early Holocene consists of an already established part of GICC 05 for GRIP and NGRIP which has now been transferred to the DYE- 3 core. GICC 05 dates the Younger Dryas termination, as defined from deuterium excess, to 11, 703 b 2 k; 130 years earlier than the previous GRIP dating. 1...|$|E
