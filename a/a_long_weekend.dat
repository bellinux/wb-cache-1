5|$|In 1918, {{after some}} negotiation, Nevinson {{agreed to work}} for the British War Memorials Committee to produce a single large artwork for a proposed, but never built, Hall of Remembrance. He was offered an honorary {{commission}} as a Second Lieutenant but refused, fearing it would prejudice his medical exemption from combat duties. A short visit over <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>weekend</b> to the Western Front was arranged but without a commission Nevinson had to be accompanied wherever he went and his movements were restricted. Nevinson quickly fell out with the Army minder assigned to him in France, and claimed he was refused permission to visit the casualty stations he wanted to sketch in.|$|E

25|$|Thompson {{became a}} {{helicopter}} pilot {{for the oil}} industry, operating in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1988 an English documentary film producer, Michael Bilton, working for Yorkshire Television, managed to contact Thompson via his mother, who was then widowed and living in Texas. At that point Thompson had all but disappeared from public life. Bilton had contacted former crew member Larry Colburn, and put Thompson and Colburn in touch with each other after a gap of nearly 16 years. Both Thompson and Colburn {{had been trying to}} find each other, but without success. Thompson was living in Lafayette, Louisiana, and Colburn near Atlanta, Georgia. They quickly arranged a reunion. Bilton spent <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>weekend</b> with Thompson discussing the events at My Lai. It proved the beginning of a long friendship which lasted until Thompson's death.|$|E
25|$|Granger's {{next project}} was Small Town Girl, a musical with Jane Powell, Ann Miller and Bobby Van. Upon its completion, {{he bought his}} release from Goldwyn, a costly {{decision}} that left him with serious financial difficulties. Granger was determined to move to Manhattan to study acting and perform on stage, but his agent convinced him to accept a role in Senso, directed by Luchino Visconti and co-starring Alida Valli. Filming in Italy lasted nine months, although Granger frequently was idle during this period, allowing him free time to explore Italy and even spend <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>weekend</b> in Paris, where he had a brief affair with Jean Marais. During his time in Venice, Granger renewed his friendship with Peggy Guggenheim, whom he had met during his earlier trip to Italy with Arthur Laurents, and he met Mike Todd, who cajoled him into making a cameo appearance as a gondolier in his epic Around the World in 80 Days. He finally returned to Hollywood exhausted but happy about the experience.|$|E

500|$|Officially, Japan has 16 national, government-recognized {{holidays}}. Public holidays in Japan {{are regulated}} under the Public Holiday Law (国民の祝日に関する法律 Kokumin no Shukujitsu ni Kansuru Hōritsu) of 1948. Beginning in 2000, Japan implemented the Happy Monday System, which moved {{a number of}} national holidays to Monday {{in order to obtain}} <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>weekend.</b> In 2006, the country decided to add Shōwa Day, a new national holiday, in place of Greenery Day on April 29, and to move Greenery Day to May 4. These changes took effect in 2007. In 2014, the House of Councillors decided to add [...] to the Japanese calendar on August 11, after lobbying by the Japanese Alpine Club. It is intended to coincide with the Bon Festival vacation time, giving Japanese people an opportunity to appreciate Japan's mountains.|$|E
500|$|In August, during <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>weekend</b> in {{the arts}} colony at Woodstock, Bryant began {{what was to be}} a long-term, {{intermittent}} love affair with painter Andrew Dasburg, with whom she had been close for a couple of years. Returning to the Village in September, Bryant and Reed rented a small house at 1 Patchin Place. Later in the month, Reed was arrested for giving a speech in which he denounced the use of Allied troops in Russia; the specific charge against him was that he had used [...] "disloyal, scurrilous and abusive language about the Military and Naval Forces of the United States". He was released on $5,000 bail. In separate cases that year, Reed stood trial with Eastman, Floyd Dell, and others from the former staff of The Masses for conspiracy to obstruct the draft of men to fight in World War I and for other alleged offenses related to published articles and cartoons; Reed's alleged crime in the latter case was that he had written a headline, [...] "Knit a Strait-Jacket for Your Soldier Boy", for an article about mental illness among the U.S. troops. Bryant was questioned in The Masses cases but not charged. Both trials involving The Masses ended in hung juries, and the defendants were set free. In October, Bryant's first book, Six Red Months in Russia, was published to [...] "mostly favorable reviews," [...] and Reed resumed work on Ten Days That Shook the World after the government returned his notes. It would not be published until April 1919.|$|E
500|$|In March 1955, St. Laurent tabled {{legislation}} {{to make the}} Department of Defence Production permanent. This would also extend the extraordinary powers of the Minister. [...] Fearful of another damaging confrontation between Howe and the Opposition, the Cabinet agreed that St. Laurent would guide the bill through, but after {{the first day of}} debate St. Laurent, who was prone to depression, absented himself. Tory frontbencher Donald Fleming contended that the extension could make the minister [...] "the virtual dictator of the economy". [...] With St. Laurent absent (or when present, silent), Howe took charge of the bill, and according to his biographers, Robert Bothwell and William Kilbourn, [...] "utterly failed to perceive that the bill and his manner of defending it were a godsend to the opposition". When Howe alluded to the Avro Arrow project and that he [...] "was out on a limb for $30 million", which gave him [...] "the shudders", the Opposition met the statement with jeers and cries of [...] "What's a million?" [...] The Tories were supported by the Social Credit MPs, while the Government gained the support of the CCF on this issue. [...] Interrupted by a lengthy governmental trip by Howe to Australia and New Zealand, the debate stretched on until midyear. In early July, Howe left town for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>weekend,</b> after asking St. Laurent and Minister of Finance Walter Harris to maintain his stand while he was gone, although he gave Harris the authority to do as he saw fit. Without informing Howe, St. Laurent contacted Drew, and the two men agreed that the minister's powers would expire in 1959 unless sooner renewed. The amended bill passed the Commons in Howe's absence, and when he returned, he furiously accused Harris of making a deal behind his back. However, when Howe was told that it had been the Prime Minister's decision, he accepted it. [...] Howe had earlier turned down an Opposition offer to agree to a three-year extension of his ministerial powers, saying [...] "That would mean coming back to Parliament in three years, and I've more to do with my time than amusing Parliament." [...] The extension was allowed to expire in 1959, although by then, Howe had left office.|$|E

500|$|Through late 1967 {{and early}} 1968, Barrett's {{behaviour}} became increasingly erratic and unpredictable, {{partly as a}} consequence of his reported heavy use of psychedelic drugs, most prominently LSD. There is also much speculation that he suffered from schizophrenia. Once described as joyful, friendly, and extroverted, he became increasingly depressed and socially withdrawn, and experienced hallucinations, disorganized speech, memory lapses, intense mood swings, and periods of catatonia. Although the changes began gradually, he went missing for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>weekend</b> and, according to several friends including Rick Wright, came back [...] "a completely different person." [...] One of the striking features of his change was the development of a blank, empty, dead-eyed stare. He was unable to recognize old friends that he had known for years, and often did not know where he was. At one point, while {{on a tour of the}} city of Los Angeles, Barrett is said to have exclaimed, [...] "Gee, it sure is nice to be in Las Vegas!" [...] Many reports described him on stage, strumming one chord through the entire concert, or not playing at all. At a show at The Fillmore in San Francisco, during a performance of [...] "Interstellar Overdrive", Barrett slowly detuned his guitar. The audience seemed to enjoy such antics, unaware of the rest of the band's consternation. Interviewed on Pat Boone's show during this tour, Syd's reply to Boone's questions was a [...] "blank and totally mute stare," [...] according to Nick Mason, [...] "Syd wasn't into moving his lips that day." [...] Barrett exhibited similar behaviour during the band's first appearance on Dick Clark's popular TV show American Bandstand. Although surviving footage of this appearance shows Barrett miming his parts of the song competently, during a group interview afterwards, when asked two questions by Clark, Barrett's answers were terse, almost to the point of rudeness (though, Clark noted, they had been flying non-stop from London to Los Angeles). During this time, Barrett would often forget to bring his guitar to sessions, damage equipment and occasionally was unable to hold his pick. Before a performance in late 1967, Barrett reportedly crushed Mandrax tranquilliser tablets and an entire tube of Brylcreem into his hair, which subsequently melted down his face under the heat of the stage lighting, making him look like [...] "a guttered candle". Nick Mason later disputed the Mandrax portion of this story, stating that [...] "Syd would never waste good mandies".|$|E
