5|$|In 1849, the new Roman Republic {{adopted an}} Italian tricolour, sent from Venice, bearing the legend DIO E POPOLO in red capital letters. This lasted for four months, while the Papal States of the Church was in <b>abeyance.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the {{decision}} was taken that its work should continue and that alumni of the Hall should have an effective mechanism {{to keep in touch}} with the Manor Hall and each other. As such the Association was brought out of <b>abeyance</b> in December 2007 with Christopher Didcote acting as its first Chairman.|$|E
5|$|Saint-Saëns gave what he {{intended}} to be his farewell concert as a pianist in Paris in 1913, but his retirement was soon in <b>abeyance</b> {{as a result of}} the war, during which he gave many performances in France and elsewhere, raising money for war charities. These activities took him across the Atlantic, despite the danger from German warships.|$|E
5|$|By {{virtue of}} the Iberian Union that joined the crowns of Portugal and Spain in 1580, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 had fallen in <b>abeyance.</b> As the Anglo–Spanish War was ongoing, Portuguese {{shipping}} was a fair target for the Royal Navy. Sir Walter Raleigh, having only just been released from the Tower of London, received a commission from Queen Elizabeth I for an expedition to the West Indies. He outfitted a sixteen ship naval squadron of which two, the Garland and Foresight belonged to the Queen.|$|E
5|$|Duke of York was {{the third}} ship in the King George V class, and was laid down at John Brown & Company's {{shipyard}} in Clydebank, Scotland, on 5 May 1937. Ironically, the title of Duke of York was in <b>abeyance</b> at that time, having been that held by King George VI prior to his succession to the throne in December 1936. The battleship was launched on 28 February 1940, and was completed on 4 November 1941. After this, the ship joined the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow.|$|E
5|$|The Constitutional Tribunal, which {{consisted}} of the Chief Justice Yong Pung How and Judges of Appeal M. Karthigesu and L.P. Thean, held that although Article 5(2A) was in <b>abeyance,</b> it represented the will of Parliament and therefore {{had to be taken}} into consideration. The Tribunal concluded that the President had no power under Article 22H(1) to withhold his assent to any bill seeking to amend any of the provisions referred to in Article 5(2A).|$|E
5|$|Upon the childless {{death of}} Roger in 1155, the Earldom of Hereford fell into <b>abeyance</b> until 1199 when King John {{bestowed}} the title on Henry de Bohun, Sibyl's grandson through her eldest daughter, Margaret. As her sons all died without legitimate offspring, Sibyl's three daughters became co-heirs to the Brecon honour, with Bertha, the second daughter, passing Sibyl's inheritance on (through marriage) to the de Braoses, thereby making them {{one of the}} most powerful families in the Welsh Marches.|$|E
5|$|Barley's {{relationship}} with Morley was short-lived. By 1600, Morley {{had turned to}} East as his assignee, authorising him to print under his name for three years. Two years later, Morley died, and his music patent fell into <b>abeyance.</b> Unable {{to rely on the}} protections and privileges of Morley's monopoly, Barley most likely came under increasing pressure from the Stationers' Company. His financial circumstances also deteriorated after he was the target of a successful lawsuit by a cook named George Goodale, who was seeking payment of a debt of 80 pounds. As a result of the suit, many of Barley's goods were seized, including various books and reams of paper. Barley greatly reduced his output from 1601 to 1605, publishing only six works.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the baronial castles in England were affected by the economic changes during the period. During the 13th and 14th centuries the average incomes of the English barons increased but wealth became concentrated {{in the hands of}} a smaller number of individuals, with a greater discrepancy in incomes. At the same time the costs of maintaining and staffing a modern castle were increasing. The result was that although there were around 400 castles in England in 1216, the number of castles continued to diminish over the coming years; even the wealthier barons were inclined to let some castles slide into disuse and to focus their resources on the remaining stock. The castle-guard system faded into <b>abeyance</b> in England, being replaced by financial rents, although it continued in the Welsh Marches well into the 13th century and saw some limited use during Edward I's occupation of Scotland in the early 14th century.|$|E
5|$|Scottish {{politics}} in the late 18th century and throughout the 19th century was dominated by the Whigs and (after 1859) their successors the Liberal Party. From the Scottish Reform Act 1832 (which {{increased the number of}} Scottish MPs and significantly widened the franchise to include more of the middle classes), {{until the end of the}} century they managed to gain a majority of the Westminster Parliamentary seats for Scotland, although these were often outnumbered by the much larger number of English and Welsh Conservatives. English-educated Scottish peer Lord Aberdeen (1784–1860) led a coalition government from 1852 to 1855, but in general very few Scots held office in the government. From the mid-century there were increasing calls for Home Rule for Scotland and when the Conservative Lord Salisbury became prime minister in 1885 he responded to pressure for more attention to be paid to Scottish issues by reviving the post of Secretary of State for Scotland, which had been in <b>abeyance</b> since 1746. He appointed the Duke of Richmond, a wealthy landowner who was both Chancellor of Aberdeen University and Lord Lieutenant of Banff. Towards the end of the century the first Scottish Liberal to become prime minister was the Earl of Rosebery (1847–1929), like Aberdeen before him a product of the English education system. In the later 19th century the issue of Irish Home Rule led to a split among the Liberals, with a minority breaking away to form the Liberal Unionists in 1886. The growing importance of the working classes was marked by Keir Hardie's success in the Mid Lanarkshire by-election, 1888, leading to the foundation of the Scottish Labour Party, which was absorbed into the Independent Labour Party in 1895, with Hardie as its first leader.|$|E
25|$|Further combat {{was kept}} in <b>abeyance</b> until the general {{outbreak}} of hostilities on December 20.|$|E
25|$|The wrecks are {{designated}} a National Historic Site of Canada with the precise {{location of the}} designation in <b>abeyance.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{loss was}} still being made on the inter-running with the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Tramways Company, but, as the Company had no {{practical}} suggestions to make, the matter was left in <b>abeyance.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 23 May 2005, Executive Order No. 429 {{directed}} that Palawan {{be transferred}} from Region IV-B to Region VI. However, Palaweños criticized the move, citing {{a lack of}} consultation, with most residents in Puerto Princesa City and all municipalities but one preferring to stay with Region IV-B. Consequently, Administrative Order No. 129 was issued on 19 August 2005 that the implementation of EO 429 be held in <b>abeyance</b> pending approval by the President of its implementation Plan. The Philippine Commission on Elections reported the 2010 Philippine general election results for Palawan {{as a part of}} the Region IV-B results. , the <b>abeyance</b> was still in effect and Palawan remained a part of Mimaropa.|$|E
25|$|In June 1942 the United States Supreme Court {{upheld the}} {{jurisdiction}} of the FCC over the issuance of rules relating to chain broadcasting. While the FCC litigation continued in the wake of this ruling, the public and private antitrust litigation was held in <b>abeyance.</b>|$|E
25|$|The West Virginia Division of Homeland Security {{proposes a}} rule that {{requests}} filed under the state Freedom of Information Act “shall be held in <b>abeyance</b> until appropriate notification of next of kin of any deceased or victims that are grievously injured.” The next of kin will have to give consent {{for the release of}} information.|$|E
25|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Royal Commission on Local Government in England in 1966, city grants were again in <b>abeyance</b> in England. Attempts by Derby, Teesside and Wolverhampton to become cities were not proceeded with. In Wales, Swansea campaigned for city status throughout the 1960s. The campaign came to a successful conclusion in 1969, in conjunction with the investiture of Charles, Prince of Wales.|$|E
25|$|Despite this auspicious start, the CJC {{fell into}} <b>abeyance</b> and was {{inactive}} until 1934. With {{the rise in}} anti-Semitism and restricted immigration policies in the 1930s, the CJC was re-convened in 1934 and held the Congress' second plenum in Toronto in January. Cohen's friend and close colleague, Samuel William Jacobs, a prominent Jewish leader and Member of Parliament became the revived Congress' first president.|$|E
25|$|If {{the issues}} raised by an unfair labor {{practice}} charge could also be resolved through the grievance and arbitration procedure of the collective bargaining agreement covering these employees, then the General Counsel may defer the case to arbitration. In those cases the General Counsel does not dismiss the charge, but holds it in <b>abeyance</b> while the parties to the contract arbitrate their contractual dispute.|$|E
25|$|Walking the Marches is {{a custom}} {{probably}} {{started in the}} 12th century. The only way the town's boundaries could be protected was to walk round inspecting them annually. The walk {{was followed by a}} dinner. This was traditionally done by the Birlaw men made up from members of the Seven Trades, the Guildry and Council. In 2014 the tradition was revived after an official <b>abeyance</b> of several years.|$|E
25|$|Sheikh Mujibur Rahman {{was arrested}} by the Pakistani Army. Yahya Khan {{appointed}} Brigadier (later General) Rahimuddin Khan to preside over a special tribunal prosecuting Rahman with multiple charges. The tribunal's sentence was never made public, but Yahya caused the verdict {{to be held in}} <b>abeyance</b> in any case. Other Awami League leaders were arrested as well, while a few fled Dacca to avoid arrest. The Awami League was banned by General Yahya Khan.|$|E
25|$|The University of Wales Trinity Saint David (UWTSD) {{already had}} its own degree {{awarding}} powers, inherited from Saint David's College, Lampeter, which were put into <b>abeyance</b> when Lampeter joined the University of Wales in 1971. From then on, Lampeter awarded Wales degrees but its own licences and diplomas. When the merger between UWTSD and the University of Wales is complete, the new unified institution will award degrees under the historic 1828 Royal Charter of Saint David's College.|$|E
25|$|The Kerguelen Islands, {{along with}} the islands of Amsterdam and St Paul, and the Crozet {{archipelago}} were officially annexed by France in 1893, and were included as possessions in the French constitution in 1924 (in addition to that portion of Antarctica claimed by France and known as Adélie Land; as with all Antarctic territorial claims, France's possession on the continent is held in <b>abeyance</b> until a new international treaty is ratified that defines each claimant's rights and obligations).|$|E
25|$|Until {{the spring}} of 1971, the {{university}} granted graduate theological degrees as well as undergraduate degrees. In the same year, the Faculty of Divinity was moved to Pine Hill, where it was formally amalgamated into the Atlantic School of Theology, an ecumenical venture with the United Church of Canada and the Roman Catholic Church. While this new institution now grants its own degrees, King's holds in <b>abeyance</b> its rights to grant divinity credentials and still continues to grant annual honorary degrees.|$|E
25|$|The Ulster Volunteers were a unionist militia {{founded in}} 1912 to block Home Rule for Ireland. In 1913 they {{organised}} {{themselves into the}} Ulster Volunteer Force to give armed resistance to the prospective Third Home Rule Act (enacted in 1914). With a rival Irish Volunteers being formed by nationalists in response, outright civil war in Ireland seemed possible. However, the outbreak of World War I intervened: the Act was put in <b>abeyance</b> until after what {{was expected to be}} a short war.|$|E
25|$|In August 2017 , The Madras High Court has {{initiated}} contempt proceedings against {{an official of}} the Registration Department for going against an order of the court and transferring an officer SIVAPRIYA, who was Joint Sub-Registrar-I, Saidapet.The court had ordered that the transfer be kept in <b>abeyance.</b> “It is understood that many sale deeds have been registered during her (SIVAPRIYA) tenure and moreover, as an officer working in that place for the past 3 years, she should be able to give details required by this court than any other new officer,” the August 3 order said..|$|E
25|$|At Safed he met Jacob Berab and {{was soon}} {{appointed}} {{a member of his}} rabbinical court. Berab exerted great influence upon him, and Karo became an enthusiastic supporter of Berab's plans for the restitution of semicha (rabbinical ordination) which had been in <b>abeyance</b> for over 11 centuries. Karo {{was one of the first}} he ordained and after Berab's death, Karo tried to perpetuate the scheme by ordaining his pupil Moses Alshech, but he finally gave up his endeavors, convinced that he could not overcome the opposition to ordination. Karo also established a yeshiva where he taught Torah to over 200 students.|$|E
25|$|Pitt {{arranged}} for the Barony of Howard de Walden to be called out of <b>abeyance</b> in Griffin's favour, so elevating him to the House of Lords, on 3 August 1784 and for Griffin to be appointed Lord Lieutenant of Essex in November 1784. Griffin became colonel of the 4th Dragoons in March 1788, was additionally created 1st Baron Braybrooke on 30 August 1788 and was promoted to field marshal on 30 July 1796. He died at his home, Audley End House, on 25 May 1797 and {{was buried in the}} churchyard of St Mary the Virgin church at Saffron Walden.|$|E
25|$|In the {{formative}} years of King's College, many more types of degrees were offered than the institution offers today; for example, the University of New Brunswick Faculty of Law traces its {{history to the}} 'King's College Law School' that was established in 1892 in Saint John, New Brunswick by King's College (Windsor). While the University of King's College has never lost nor relinquished interest in these granting powers, they are held in <b>abeyance</b> due to agreements with the University of King's College's partner, Dalhousie University, {{as part of the}} agreement to allow the portion of Dalhousie's campus to be used by the University of King's College.|$|E
25|$|The third highest Papal {{order is}} the Order of Pius IX, founded on 17 June 1847 by Pope Pius IX. The Order of Pius IX {{is the highest}} Papal order {{currently}} awarded. There previously existed an Order of Pian Knights, founded in the 16th century, which later fell into <b>abeyance.</b> It {{is not related to}} this order. The Order of Pius IX is the first of the Papal Orders, by order of precedence, to include different grades. The highest grade is the Collar, followed by the Grand Cross, Commander with Star, Commander, and Knight. The Order may be presented to non-Catholic Christians and to non-Christians.|$|E
25|$|The {{league is}} played as a 50 overs tournament, with the {{exception}} of 2009, where due to difficulties in scheduling the League due to the unavailability of Austria CC Wien's ground in the Markomannenstrasse, it has been necessary to reduce the competition to a 35 overs format to ensure that the competition can be played to a conclusion. In 2008 logistical issues had meant that the parallel conference system was in <b>abeyance,</b> with a regionalised structure (a Vienna group and a non-Vienna group) with a knock-out stage for the top 6 Viennese teams joined by the top 2 from the non-Vienna group. The 2008 Open League champions were Pakistan CC, retaining the title they had won in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Advice in 1945 when Hitler asked Dönitz {{whether the}} Geneva Convention should be denounced. Hitler's motives were twofold. The first was that {{reprisals}} {{could be taken}} against Western Allied prisoners of war; second, it would deter German forces from surrendering to the Western Allies (as was happening on the Eastern Front where the Geneva Convention was in <b>abeyance).</b> Instead of arguing the conventions should never be denounced, Dönitz suggested it was not expedient to do so, so the court found against him on this issue; but as the Convention was not denounced by Germany, and British prisoners in camps under Dönitz's jurisdiction were treated strictly according to the Convention, the Court considered these mitigating circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Later {{that summer}} Mackintosh petitioned for a Commission {{of fire and}} sword against Cameron, unsuccessfully at first but in 1663 he had the whole of Clan Cameron {{declared}} outlaws. The commission against Cameron authorised various noblemen to implement it, but when approached by Mackintosh, they all told him to accept the financial compensation {{that had already been}} offered to him by Cameron. So Mackintosh decided to take matters into his own hands and having failed to induce his neighbours to join him, resorted to bribery to get them on his side. Meanwhile, in January 1665, the Duke of Rothes, Lord Chancellor of Scotland, ordered the Commission of Fire and Sword into <b>abeyance</b> until the Privy Council had decided what to do.|$|E
25|$|Mildmay's {{older brother}} Sir Thomas (d. 1566), was an auditor of the Court of Augmentation (which had been {{established}} in 1537 for controlling the property taken by the Crown from the monasteries), and was the grandfather of Thomas (d. 1626), who was created a baronet in 1611, and of Henry (d. 1654), who was knighted. The latter claimed, in right of his mother Frances Ratcliffe, daughter of Henry, third baron Fitz-walter, and second earl of Sussex, the barony of Fitz-walter, and his grandson Benjamin (d. 1679), on 10 February 1670, was summoned to the House of Lords by that title. Benjamin's two sons, Charles (d. 1728) and Benjamin, were in succession Lords Fitz-walter, the latter being further created Viscount Harwich and Earl Fitz-walter in 1730. On his death, in 1756, the earldom became extinct and the barony fell into <b>abeyance.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{expedition}} {{gathered at}} Plymouth, England on 14 September 1585 with Sir Francis Drake {{in command of}} twenty one ships with 1,800 soldiers under Christopher Carleill. Sailing from Plymouth he first attacked Vigo in Spain and held the place for two weeks ransoming supplies. Drake however intended {{this to be a}} diversionary raid where it was hoped to trick the Spanish to think they were not heading towards the Caribbean, by doing this he had already made sure his presence was felt at Las Palmas in the Canary islands. After taking on water from the undefended La Gomera island, he continued his voyage, heading south towards the former Portuguese Cape Verde Islands. By virtue of the Iberian Union, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 was in <b>abeyance,</b> and the commencement of war with Spain, Portuguese colonies and ships were now a target for the English.|$|E
25|$|Cheshire {{never had}} a {{classical}} presbytery, and had been dependent on the Manchester classis for many important functions. A voluntary association was proposed by a meeting of Cheshire ministers at Wilmslow on 14 September 1653, making it contemporary with the association founded by Baxter in Worcestershire. Its establishment was agreed {{at a meeting in}} Knutsford the following month. Like Baxter's movement, it was intended to carry some of the ordaining and disciplinary functions left in <b>abeyance</b> by the collapse of the national Presbyterian project in 1648. The workings and extent of the association are unclear but Fisher was closely associated with the leading figures in it and his judgement respected by them. In November 1656 Henry Newcome, one of the founders, had the opportunity of taking up the incumbency of Julian's church in Shrewsbury after losing a valuable post in Manchester. Baxter wrote a detailed and encouraging letter to him, but at the end deferred to Fisher's closer knowledge.|$|E
