Seeragasamba is a short-grain <b>aromatic</b> rice <b>variety</b> of the indica type, which is cultivated in a limited area in India. Whole genome sequencing of this variety identified a new badh 2 allele (badh 2 -p) with an 8 bp insertion in the promoter region of the BADH 2 gene.

40|$|Aromatic rice {{is highly}} prized by most rice consumers, and many {{countries}} cultivate traditional and improved <b>aromatic</b> <b>varieties.</b> 2 -Acetyl- 1 -pyrroline (2 AP) {{is the major}} aromatic compound in rice, and is believed to accumulate because of an eight-base-pair (8 -bp) deletion in an allele at the fragrance locus. In this study, 2 AP was quantified and {{the presence or absence}} of the fragrance allele (fgr) was determined in 464 samples of traditional varieties of rice from the T. T. Chang Genetic Resources Centre at the International Rice Research Institute. It was shown that a number of <b>aromatic</b> <b>varieties,</b> primarily from South and South-East Asia, do not carry the 8 -bp deletion, but 2 AP was identified in both raw and cooked rice of these varieties. We suggest that the 8 -bp deletion in fgr is not the only cause of aroma, and at least one other mutation drives the accumulation of 2 AP. The amount of 2 AP in most uniform fgr genotypes was not significantly different from that in aromatic nfgr genotypes, but several fgr genotypes, primarily from South Asia, reproducibly accumulated exceptionally large amounts of 2 AP. We suggest that the mutation leading to 2 AP in <b>aromatic</b> nfgr <b>varieties</b> possibly originated several times and, through either domestication or evolution, the fgr gene and other alleles leading to 2 AP have combined in South Asia, leading to several highly <b>aromatic</b> traditional <b>varieties.</b> The identification of multiple mutations for 2 AP will enable rice breeding programmes to select actively for multiple genetic sources of 2 AP, leading to the development of highly aromatic and, consequently, high-quality varieties of rice...|$|R

30|$|The world-renowned Thai Hom Mali Rice {{has been}} the most {{important}} aromatic rice originating in Thailand. The <b>aromatic</b> <b>variety</b> was collected from Chachoengsao, a central province, and after pure-line selection, it was officially named as Khao Dawk Mali 105, (KDML 105). Because of its superb fragrance and cooking quality, KDML 105 has been a model variety for studying genes controlling grain quality and aroma. The aromatic gene was cloned in KDML 105, as an amino aldehyde dehydrogenase (AMADH) or better known as BADH 2 located on chromosome 8. Later on, all other aromatic rice genes were discovered as allelic to the AMADH. As a selection of local landrace variety found in rainfed areas, the Thai Jasmine rice showed adaptive advantages over improved irrigated rice in less fertile lowland rainfed conditions. Because KDML 105 was susceptible to most diseases and insect pests, marker-assisted backcross selection (MABC) was used for the genetic improvement since 2000. After nearly 17  years of MABC for integrating new traits into KDML 105, a new generation of KDML 105, designated HM 84, was developed which maintains the cooking quality and fragrance, and has gained advantages during flash flooding, disease, and insect outbreak.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of different grape mash maceration treatments on the varietal and secondary aroma profiles of wines produced from an aromatic red grape variety, Muškat ruža porečki, have been investigated. Two essentially different techniques were applied, fermentative maceration {{at room temperature}} and prefermentative cryomaceration, both in durations of one, three and five days. Generally, higher concentrations of free and bound varietal aroma compounds were found in wines obtained by maceration at room temperature in relation to cryomaceration. Regarding {{the effect of the}} duration of maceration, the highest concentrations were determined in wines obtained by three-day maceration treatments, in both fermentative and cryomaceration treatments. Secondary aroma compounds followed a less uniform pattern. The compounds with the highest odour unit values in all investigated wines were linalool, citronellol, geraniol, β-damascenone, β-ionone, isoamyl alcohol, 2 -phenylethanol, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, isoamyl acetate, ethyl acetate, and diethyl succinate. It has been shown that Muškat ruža porečki is an <b>aromatic</b> <b>variety,</b> producing wines with notable monoterpenol fraction, which are characterized by a typical varietal Muscat aroma with a dominant rose odour accompanied by red fruit nuances.

40|$|AbstractFour grapevine {{varieties}} {{cultivated in}} Romania, two known from ancient times (Tamâioasa româneasca and Italian Riesling) {{and the other}} two derived by cross-breeding or free-pollination from these (Sarba and Alb Aromat, respectively) were cultivated in the same conditions and vinified by using the same technology, so that the assessment of their volatile profile with an electronic nose would reflect only their differences and similarities. Sarba variety was obtained in 1972 in Odobesti region and is supposedly genetically related to Italian Riesling and a muscat-type grape. Although the research information is scarce and some popular sources cite as ancestors either the Italian Riesling or the Tamâioasa, while some other mention both, the Vitis International Variety Catalogue ([URL] mentions as pedigree ancestors confirmed by markers the Italian Riesling and Muscat of Hambourg. As for the Alb Aromat variety it was obtained at the Pietroasa Research station by self-pollination of Tamâioasa and officially registered in 1999. It may also have in its pedigree the grape Maria Pirovano, as mentioned in the Vitis International Variety Catalogue. Both these new varieties are semi-aromatic, with a muscat-based aroma profile derived from the parent <b>aromatic</b> <b>variety.</b> The resulted wines were analyzed with a double column gas-chromatograph functioning as an electronic nose, providing fingerprints of the volatile substances profile for each sample. The statistical analysis of the volatile profiles confirmed that Sarba is likely to have a parent-offspring relationship with both Italian Riesling and Tamâioasa (or other muscat-type grape), while the Alb Aromat has a closer profile only to Tamâioasa.

The first written mention about local hop garden comes from 1348, {{but it is}} certain that the hop gardens were owned by brewers and church dignitaries even earlier. First, hops was grown on the monastery grounds on a large scale. Czech, and thus Saaz hops, reached its peak in the 19 th century, mainly for its fragrance, color and kontent of lupulin, and became a {{benchmark}} for determining the quality and price of hops. Kazbek is the first variety of "flavour hops" bred in the Czech Republic. Its unique sensory properties were examined with numerous brewing tests in several breweries of different sizes. Breeding of "flavour hops" is a real challenge for hop breeders. The first hop in that category, for example Citra, Amarillo, Simcoe, Bravo, were bred in the United States. Variety Kazbek was obtained by selecting progeny of the hybrid material, which has origins in Russian wild hops. It was registered in 2008 due to high stability and efficiency. Robustness and stability is expressed {{in the name of the}} variety, because Kazbek is the highest mountain of the middle Caucasus. From the brewing point of view, it belongs among the bitter types. Saaz Late variety was obtained by selecting F 1 offspring of parental combination of unfinished breeding material that is the origin of Saaz. It has a charakter of late variety. Saaz Late is an <b>aromatic</b> <b>variety</b> for the second and third hopping. Aroma is genuine, fine, hoppy. The most important quality aspect of hops is alpha acids content.
