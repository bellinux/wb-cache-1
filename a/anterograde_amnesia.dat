5|$|Additional {{caution is}} {{required}} in the elderly, as they are {{more sensitive to the}} pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines, metabolise them more slowly, and are more prone to adverse effects, including drowsiness, amnesia (especially <b>anterograde</b> <b>amnesia),</b> ataxia, hangover effects, confusion, and falls.|$|E
5|$|The {{short-term}} use of benzodiazepines adversely affects multiple {{areas of}} cognition, {{the most notable}} one being that it interferes with the formation and consolidation of memories of new material and may induce complete <b>anterograde</b> <b>amnesia.</b> However, researchers hold contrary opinions regarding the effects of long-term administration. One view {{is that many of}} the short-term effects continue into the long-term and may even worsen, and are not resolved after stopping benzodiazepine usage. Another view maintains that cognitive deficits in chronic benzodiazepine users occur only for a short period after the dose, or that the anxiety disorder is the cause of these deficits.|$|E
5|$|Pearce {{stars as}} a man who, {{as a result of}} a past trauma, suffers from <b>anterograde</b> <b>amnesia</b> (the {{inability}} to form new memories) and suffers short-term memory loss approximately every five minutes. He is searching for the persons who attacked him and killed his wife, using an intricate system of Polaroid photographs and tattoos to track information he cannot remember. Memento is presented as two different sequences of scenes interspersed during the film: a series in black-and-white that is shown chronologically, and a series of color sequences shown in reverse order (simulating for the audience the mental state of the protagonist). The two sequences meet at the end of the film, producing one complete and cohesive narrative.|$|E

40|$|A connectionist {{model is}} presented, the TraceLink model, that {{implements}} an autonomous "off-line" consolidation process. The model {{consists of three}} subsystems: (1) a trace system (neocortex), (2) a link system (hippocampus and adjacent regions), and (3) a modulatory system (basal forebrain and other areas). The model is able to account {{for many of the}} characteristics of <b>anterograde</b> and retrograde <b>amnesia,</b> including Ribot gradients, transient global amnesia, patterns of shrinkage of retrograde amnesia, and correlations between <b>anterograde</b> and retrograde <b>amnesia</b> or the absence thereof (e. g., in isolated retrograde amnesia). In addition, it produces normal forgetting curves and can exhibit permastore. It also offers an explanation for the advantages of learning under high arousal or long-term retention. © 2005 Psychology Press Ltd...|$|R
5|$|While rescuing Sub-Commander T'Pol from {{a spatial}} anomaly, Captain Archer is {{infected}} by subspace parasites in his cerebral cortex, resulting in <b>anterograde</b> <b>amnesia.</b> His condition prevents him from forming new long term memories. This {{allows him to}} remember everything prior to the accident, but any new memories fade within a few hours. It soon becomes clear that Archer is not fit for duty, and he is subsequently relieved of his command. T'Pol is granted a field commission to Captain, but the mission fails and Earth, alongside every other human colony, is destroyed by the Xindi weapon. The few surviving humans form a convoy, led by the Enterprise, which travels to the planet Ceti Alpha V.|$|E
5|$|The {{black and}} white {{sequences}} begin with Leonard Shelby, an insurance investigator, in a motel room speaking to an unseen and unknown caller. Leonard has <b>anterograde</b> <b>amnesia</b> and is unable to store recent memories, {{the result of an}} attack by two men. Leonard explains that he killed the attacker who raped and strangled his wife, but a second clubbed him and escaped. The police did not accept that there was a second attacker, but Leonard believes the attacker's name is John or James, with a last name starting with G. Leonard conducts his own investigation using a system of notes, Polaroids, and tattoos. From his occupation, Leonard recalls a fellow anterograde amnesiac: Sammy Jankis. Sammy's diabetic wife, who wasn't sure if his condition was genuine, repeatedly requested insulin; she hoped that he would remember having given her an injection and stop himself from giving another before she died of an overdose. However, Sammy continues to administer the injections, and his wife falls into a fatal coma.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam is a short-acting {{benzodiazepine}} {{in adults}} with an elimination half-life of 1.5-2.5 hours. In the elderly, {{as well as}} young children and adolescents, the elimination half-life is longer. Midazolam is metabolised into an active metabolite alpha1-hydroxymidazolam. Age-related deficits, renal and liver status affect the pharmacokinetic factors of midazolam {{as well as its}} active metabolite. However, the active metabolite of midazolam is minor and contributes to only 10 percent of biological activity of midazolam. Midazolam is poorly absorbed orally, with only 50 percent of the drug reaching the bloodstream. Midazolam is metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and by glucuronide conjugation. The therapeutic as well as adverse effects of midazolam are due to its effects on the GABAA receptors; midazolam does not activate GABAA receptors directly but, as with other benzodiazepines, it enhances the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA on the GABAA receptors (↑ frequency of Cl− channel opening) resulting in neural inhibition. Almost all of the properties {{can be explained by the}} actions of benzodiazepines on GABAA receptors. This results in the following pharmacological properties being produced: sedation, induction of sleep, reduction in anxiety, <b>anterograde</b> <b>amnesia,</b> muscle relaxation and anticonvulsant effects.|$|E
50|$|Clive Wearing (born 11 May 1938) is a British musicologist, conductor, tenor and keyboardist {{who suffers}} from chronic <b>anterograde</b> and {{retrograde}} <b>amnesia.</b> He lacks the ability to form new memories, and also cannot recall aspects of his past memories, frequently believing that he has only recently awoken from a comatose state.|$|R
50|$|The retrosplenial cortex is one {{of several}} brain areas that {{produces}} both an <b>anterograde</b> and retrograde <b>amnesia</b> when damaged.

40|$|Research on discursive {{cohesion}} and coherence {{has focused on}} patient groups with diffuse damage and widespread cognitive impairment (e. g.,TBI, dementia). Consequently, attempts to attribute discourse deficits to a particular cognitive domain has proven difficult. The current study capitalizes on a rare patient group with selective and severe <b>anterograde</b> hippocampal <b>amnesia</b> to investigate the contribution of declarative memory to discourse {{cohesion and}} coherence {{across a range of}} discourse genres.

5|$|Beer {{contains}} ethyl alcohol, {{the same}} chemical that {{is present in}} wine and distilled spirits and as such, beer consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol {{in the human body}} have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan over which the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, <b>anterograde</b> <b>amnesia,</b> vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious) and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. As with all alcoholic drinks, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have severe criminal penalties against drunk driving.|$|E

25|$|As {{described}} above, {{patients with}} <b>anterograde</b> <b>amnesia</b> {{have a wide}} range of forgetfulness. Declarative memory can be further subdivided into episodic and semantic memory. Episodic memory is the recollection of autobiographical information with a temporal and/or spatial context, whereas semantic memory involves recall of factual information with no such association (language, history, geography, etc.). In a case study of a girl who developed <b>anterograde</b> <b>amnesia</b> during childhood, it was determined that the patient ("C.L.") retained semantic memory while suffering an extreme impairment of episodic memory.|$|E
40|$|Korsakoff's Syndrome is an amnestic {{disorder}} that involves both <b>anterograde</b> and retrograde <b>amnesia.</b> Traditionally associated with longstanding alcohol misuse, thiamine deficiency has been long posited in its pathogenesis, as has dienecephalic lesions.

40|$|Alcohol {{dependence}} {{and alcohol abuse}} or harmful use cause substantial morbidity and mortality. Alcohol-use disorders are associated with depressive episodes, severe anxiety, insomnia, suicide, and abuse of other drugs. Continued heavy alcohol use also shortens the onset of heart disease, stroke, cancers, and liver cirrhosis, by aff ecting the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and immune systems. Heavy drinking can also cause mild <b>anterograde</b> <b>amnesias,</b> temporary cognitive defi cits, sleep problems, and peripheral neuropathy; cause gastrointestinal problems; decrease bone density and production of blood cells; and cause fetal alcohol syndrome. Alcohol-use disorders complicate assessment and treatment of other medical and psychiatric problems. Standard criteria for alcohol dependence—the more severe disorder—can be used to reliably identify people for whom drinking causes major physiological consequences and persistent impairment of {{quality of life and}} ability to function. Clinicians should routinely screen for alcohol disorders, using clinical interviews, questionnaires, blood tests, or a combination of these methods. Causes include environmental factors and specifi c genes that aff ect the risk of alcohol-use disorders, including genes for enzymes that metabolise alcohol, such as alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase; those associated with disinhibition; and those that confer a low sensitivity to alcohol. Treatment can include motivational interviewing to help people to evaluate their situations, brief interventions to facilitate more healthy behaviours, detoxifi cation to address withdrawal symptoms, cognitive-behavioural therapies to avoid relapses, and judicious use of drugs to diminish cravings or discourage relapses...|$|R
50|$|The {{effect of}} {{seizures}} on memory are often categorized {{with respect to}} their intensity and the cortical areas they affect. Epileptic patients, especially those who suffer from temporal lobe epilepsy, often experience deficits in memory encoding and retrieval, developing <b>anterograde</b> and retrograde <b>amnesia.</b> At times, if a seizure specifically affects the hippocampus, the individual afflicted can encode memory; however, that memory rapidly extinguishes.|$|R
25|$|Patients with amnesia {{can learn}} new information, {{particularly}} non-declarative knowledge. However, some patients with dense <b>anterograde</b> <b>amnesia</b> {{do not remember}} the episodes during which they learned or observed the information previously.|$|E
25|$|On occasion, benzodiazepines can induce extreme {{alterations}} in memory such as <b>anterograde</b> <b>amnesia</b> and amnesic automatism, {{which may have}} medico-legal consequences. Such reactions occur usually only at the higher dose end of the prescribing spectrum.|$|E
25|$|A {{limited number}} of cases have been {{described}} in which patients with damage {{to other parts of}} the brain acquired <b>anterograde</b> <b>amnesia.</b> Easton and Parker observed damage to either the hippocampus or the surrounding cortices does not seem to result in severe amnesia in primate models. They suggested damage to the hippocampus and surrounding structures alone does not explain the amnesia they saw in patients, or increasing damage does not correlate with the degree of impairment. Furthermore, the data do not explain the dichotomy that exists in the MTL memory system between episodic and semantic memory. To demonstrate their hypothesis, they used a primate model with damage to the basal forebrain. They proposed that the disruption of neurons that project from the basal forebrain to the MTL are responsible for some of the impairment in <b>anterograde</b> <b>amnesia.</b> Easton and Parker also reported MRI scans of patients with severe <b>anterograde</b> <b>amnesia</b> showed damage beyond to cortical areas around the hippocampus and amygdala (a region of brain involved in emotions) and to surrounding white matter (white matter in the brain consists of axons, long projections of neuronal cell bodies).|$|E
40|$|A case is {{reported}} of a cystic craniopharyngioma involving {{the floor and}} walls of the third ventricle.

The relevance of these observations to the amnesic syndrome and its neuropathological basis is discussed...|$|R
50|$|A {{slightly}} greater {{injury is}} associated with both <b>anterograde</b> and retrograde <b>amnesia</b> (inability to remember events {{before or after the}} injury). The amount of time that the amnesia is present correlates with the severity of the injury. In all cases the patients develop postconcussion syndrome, which includes memory problems, dizziness, tiredness, sickness and depression. Cerebral concussion is the most common head injury seen in children.|$|R
40|$|Alcohol-related blackouts (ARBs) are <b>anterograde</b> <b>amnesias</b> {{related to}} heavy alcohol intake seen in about 50 % of drinkers. Although a major {{determinant}} of ARBs relates to blood alcohol concentrations, additional contributions come from genetic vulnerabilities and possible impacts of cannabis use disorders (CUDs). We evaluated relationships of genetics and cannabis use to latent class trajectories of ARBs in 829 subjects from the Collaborative Study of the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA). The number of ARBs experienced every 2 years from subjects with average ages of 18 to 25 {{were entered into}} a latent class growth analysis in Mplus, and resulting class membership was evaluated in light of baseline characteristics, including CUDs. Correlations of number of ARBs across assessments were also compared for sibling pairs versus unrelated subjects. Latent class growth analysis identified ARB-based Classes 1 (consistent low = 42. 5 %), 2 (moderate low = 28. 3 %), 3 (moderate high = 22. 9 %), and 4 (consistent high = 6. 3 %). A multinomial logistic regression analysis within latent class growth analysis revealed that baseline CUDs related most closely to Classes 3 and 4. The number of ARBs across time correlated. 23 for sibling pairs and -. 10 for unrelated subjects. Baseline CUDs related to the most severe latent ARB course over time, even when considered along with other trajectory predictors, including baseline alcohol use disorders and maximum number of drinks. Data indicated significant roles for genetic factors for alcohol use disorder patterns over time. Future research is needed to improve understanding of how cannabis adds to the ARB risk and to find genes that contribute to risks for ARBs among drinkers...|$|R
25|$|<b>Anterograde</b> <b>amnesia</b> {{is a loss}} of {{the ability}} to create new {{memories}} after the event that caused the amnesia, leading to a partial or complete inability to recall the recent past, while long-term memories from before the event remain intact. This is in contrast to retrograde amnesia, where memories created prior to the event are lost while new memories can still be created. Both can occur together in the same patient. To a large degree, <b>anterograde</b> <b>amnesia</b> remains a mysterious ailment because the precise mechanism of storing memories is not yet well understood, although it is known that the regions involved are certain sites in the temporal cortex, especially in the hippocampus and nearby subcortical regions.|$|E
25|$|Emotionally arousing stimuli {{can lead}} to {{retrograde}} amnesia for preceding events and <b>anterograde</b> <b>amnesia</b> for subsequent events.

25|$|Approaches used {{to treat}} those who suffer from <b>anterograde</b> <b>amnesia</b> often use {{interventions}} which focus on compensatory techniques, such as beepers, written notes, diaries or through intensive training programs involving the active participation of the individual concerned, along with their supporting network of family and friends.|$|E
40|$|Scopolamine, an anticholinergic, is an {{attractive}} amnesic agent for discerning the action of candidate antiamnesic drugs. Bacopa monniera Linn (Syn.

In this study we wanted to test if scopolamine-induced impairment of spatial memory can also be ameliorated by B. monniera using water maze mouse model. The objective of study was to study the effect of B. monniera on scopolamine-induced amnesia.

25|$|Acetylcholine {{has been}} implicated in {{learning}} and memory in several ways. The anticholinergic drug, scopolamine, impairs acquisition of new information in humans and animals. In animals, disruption of the supply of acetylcholine to the neocortex impairs the learning of simple discrimination tasks, comparable to the acquisition of factual information and disruption of the supply of acetylcholine to the hippocampus and adjacent cortical areas produces forgetting comparable to <b>anterograde</b> <b>amnesia</b> in humans.|$|E
25|$|In animal models, {{researchers}} have shown monkeys with damage {{to both the}} hippocampus and its adjacent cortical regions were more severely impaired in terms of <b>anterograde</b> <b>amnesia</b> than monkeys with damage localized to hippocampal structures.

25|$|Adverse {{effects of}} benzodiazepines such as {{diazepam}} include <b>anterograde</b> <b>amnesia</b> and confusion (especially pronounced in higher doses) and sedation. The elderly {{are more prone}} to adverse effects of diazepam, such as confusion, amnesia, ataxia, and hangover effects, as well as falls. Long-term use of benzodiazepines such as diazepam is associated with drug tolerance, benzodiazepine dependence, and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Like other benzodiazepines, diazepam can impair short-term memory and learning of new information. While benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam can cause <b>anterograde</b> <b>amnesia,</b> they do not cause retrograde amnesia; information learned before using benzodiazepines is not impaired. Tolerance to the cognitive-impairing effects of benzodiazepines does not tend to develop with long-term use, and the elderly are more sensitive to them. Additionally, after cessation of benzodiazepines, cognitive deficits may persist for at least six months; it is unclear whether these impairments take longer than six months to abate or if they are permanent. Benzodiazepines may also cause or worsen depression. Infusions or repeated intravenous injections of diazepam when managing seizures, for example, may lead to drug toxicity, including respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. Drug tolerance may also develop to infusions of diazepam if it is given for longer than 24 hours. Adverse effects such as sedation, benzodiazepine dependence, and abuse potential limit the use of benzodiazepines.|$|E
