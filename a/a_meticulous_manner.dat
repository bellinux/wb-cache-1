50|$|Oil paint {{comprises}} ground pigment {{mixed with}} linseed and perhaps other oils. It is a medium which {{takes a long}} time to dry, and lends itself to varied methods and styles of application. It can be used on a rigid wooden panel, but because it remains flexible, it can also be applied to a base of canvas made from densely woven linen flax, hence, the linseed oil and the canvas base are both products of the same plant which is harvested in Northern Europe. With canvas spread over a wooden frame as a base, paintings can be made very large and still light in weight, and relatively transportable though liable to damage.

50|$|A third, more {{systematic}} and thorough excavation {{of the cemetery}} was then undertaken in 1862 by Septimus Davidson, the landowner of {{the area of the}} heath that fell {{to the north of the}} bisecting road. A city solicitor and former legal adviser to the government of the Ottoman Empire, he had no training in excavation, but was curious as to the historic mounds that lay on his land. He was assisted in this endeavor by three others: local surgeon Dr Nicholas Hele, and two other men known only as Francis Francis and 'Mr C'. Although none of them had any training in excavation, they did so in <b>a</b> <b>meticulous</b> <b>manner,</b> starting with a pit in the centre of each mound and then digging outwards, all the time recording the position of artefacts, such as the ship rivets, in situ. There were nevertheless problems, such as when a spade shattered the rim of a buried urn. With the exception of Mr C, the excavators each wrote and published their own accounts of the excavation, which displayed a great deal of consistency with one another. Davidson's account was presented at a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries in January 1863, while Francis published two articles in The Field in January and March 1863, followed by a paper for the Archaeological Journal. Hele then devoted a chapter to the excavation in his 1870 book Notes and Jottings about Aldeburgh.|$|E

50|$|After {{becoming}} {{familiar with}} Wetherton, his carefulness towards danger reveals itself. Everything {{he comes across}} is dealt with in <b>a</b> watchful, <b>meticulous</b> <b>manner.</b> For example, when he discovers the batholith, “his innate caution takes hold, and he draws back to examine it at greater length”. Only after he inspects it does he begin to remove gold. Soon following {{his study of the}} rock, he continues in his guarded manner, and he constructs a supported path for a swift retreat, in the situation that the massive structure collapses. Even when removing the gold from the stone, he refrains from swinging the pickaxe; he painstakingly removes pieces using the pick as a bar to prevent structural damage. Apparently, his life is driven by his nature to warily review his surroundings.|$|R
2500|$|The Pomegranate also {{published}} {{a review of}} Hutton's tome authored by Sarah Whedon of the University of Colorado. Noting that it was unparalleled, she {{believed that it was}} a valuable addition to the growing field of Pagan studies, being written in <b>an</b> entertaining and <b>meticulous</b> <b>manner.</b> She nevertheless believed that it contained problems, for instance disagreeing with Hutton's statement that Madame Blavatsky was ultimately a Christian and believing that he had left some historical sections underdeveloped. She notes that because he is dealing with the hidden history of a mystery religion, Hutton has had to be selective in what information he decided to publish and which he kept from publication, believing that this might annoy many readers. Like O'Connor, she notes that Hutton has opened up multiple new lines of inquiry for further research, but feels that his final chapter, the sociological analysis of Wicca, was disappointing. She nevertheless thought that these criticisms were [...] "minor" [...] in comparison to the contribution to Pagan studies that the work brought.|$|R
40|$|The {{architect}} Patrick Alban Gwynne (1913 - 2003) designed The Homewood for {{his parents}} in 1938 {{at the age of}} 24. An immensely private man, Gwynne ran his life, his home and his architectural practice in <b>a</b> <b>meticulous</b> <b>manner</b> quite separate from the mainstream modernist architects of his day. In Modern Houses in Britain, Jeremy Gould considers The Homewood {{to be one of the}} finest modern houses in terms of composition and detailing. It is an accomplished translation of Le Corbusier’s Villa Savoye with an elegantly English flavour. Gwynne acknowledged the stylistic influences of his former employer Wells Coates, but whereas an idealistic functionalism was a component of Coates’s architecture, Gwynne took an elegant approach to his work, which was domestic and client led. He created a sensual, more decorative modernism that lay somewhere between the idealism of the Modern Movement and a still extant English tradition. Architectural history emphasises wider reassessments of Modernism during the Interwar period and the thesis is an opportunity to reflect on the development of an architect and his architectural ideas for a series of unique houses for his clients. The seamless integration of The Homewood with the Modern Movement and the country house idiom is crucial to the research and Gwynne merged the two, ensuring that every detail was specific to his tastes. The house was a testing ground for new materials and architectural processes and has been described as Gwynne’s “design laboratory’. The Homewood’s acquisition by the National Trust has ensured that Gwynne’s home and his collection are secure for the future and will continue to be a testament to his abiding interest in high-quality craftsmanship, his attention to detail and a lifetime of changing tastes of one individual. The thesis will enhance Gwynne’s recognition in British architectural history and the house will be used as a point of reference to chart the progression of his elegant style and understand his work in greater depth...|$|E

"In {{this book}} Hutton {{provides}} history which was sorely lacking, writes {{in a manner}} accessible to the educated practitioner as well as meaningful to the scholar, and opens up areas needing further research with the academic boost of having been presented by an established scholar in a publication from a well respected press...

40|$|Note: Manuscript very warped. Professor Wilder Penfield has accumulated, in <b>a</b> <b>meticulous</b> and {{laborious}} <b>manner,</b> data {{representing the}} effects of stimulation of the human cerebral cortex. Although these stimulations have been carried on for twenty odd years, it has been only during {{the past four years}} that more especial attention has been directed towards speech. In 1946, Dr. Preston Robb summarized the effect on speech of excising various cortical areas. These patients had had previous cerebral injuries with resultant focal cerebral seizures. Dr. Robb also began to assist Dr. Penfield in the operating room during the period of stimulation. The examination of patients before and after operation and the assistance in the operating theater have been and will be continued by this writer. The results of cortical stimulation on speech or, better, electrical arrest of certain speech mechanisms are presented at this time in order to summarize the present data and give suggestions for future study. Electrical arrest of three, or possibly four discrete cortical regions produces disturbances in speech other than simple arrest of speech. Few definite conclusions have been reached by either Dr. Robb or this author, but the groundwork has been laid. It is hoped and expected that a real contribution to the localization of areas producing specific speech defects and to the physiology of speech will be forthcoming at the conclusion of this project on stimulations and excisions of the cortex.
