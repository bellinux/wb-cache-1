One wrote there were 12million victims and another wrote there were 800,000. I have no desire to argue with the figures. The Holocaust was a terrible, unforgivable crime against the Jewish nation, a crime against humanity that cannot be accepted by humankind. The Holocaust was <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> and nobody can claim I denied it.|$|E

500|$|The {{damage done}} by Sherman was almost entirely limited to the {{destruction}} of property. Though exact figures are not available, the loss of civilian life appears to have been very small. Consuming supplies, wrecking infrastructure, and undermining morale were Sherman's stated goals, and several of his Southern contemporaries noted this and commented on it. For instance, Alabama-born Major Henry Hitchcock, who served in Sherman's staff, declared that [...] "it is <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> to consume and destroy the sustenance of thousands of people," [...] but if the scorched earth strategy served [...] "to paralyze their husbands and fathers who are fighting ... it is mercy in the end".|$|E
500|$|On {{his role}} in the episode, Jason Dohring, who plays Logan, elaborated, [...] "I think what's funny is that he always gets what's coming to him. Like <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> happens to him, but he's like that to other people. So it's like in real life…what goes around comes around." [...] The episode {{features}} a guest-starring appearance by Kayla Ewell, who would eventually become most known for her role on The Vampire Diaries. The episode also features a guest appearance by James Jordan, as Lucky, the janitor. In season 3, Jordan would become the first actor to have two different roles on Veronica Mars when he was cast as Tim Foyle, a teaching assistant.|$|E
500|$|The {{small crowd}} in Worcester were {{angered by the}} decision, and Worcestershire's {{secretary}} Mike Vockins gave all those present a full refund while describing Somerset's declaration as [...] "an absolute disgrace". Some Somerset fans had travelled over [...] to watch the game, while Alan Gibson of The Times (although note that this paper was on strike at the time) had only just arrived at the railway station when he was told by a porter that {{he might as well}} head back as the match had finished. The Somerset team left the ground within 14 minutes {{of the end of the}} game. As they were leaving, one spectator banged on Rose's car window and shouted at him, [...] "You've done <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> for cricket." ...|$|E

500|$|Tahil's casting was {{considered}} to be controversial, and was slammed by British Asian actors who said the part should have been given to a UK actor, referring to it as [...] "disgraceful". Actors Albert Moses and Renu Setna complained that home-grown talent was being overlooked, with Moses saying, [...] "British Asian actors have been fighting {{for the last five years}} to persuade the BBC to bring an Asian family into EastEnders and when at last it happens it goes to Bollywood. It is a disgrace and an insult to British Asian actors. This is <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> for the BBC to do. It should be ashamed." [...] Setna said: [...] "I have heard that for this storyline the BBC has brought over a Bollywood star to play the father. Why, when we have excellent Asian actors of our own?" [...] British immigration laws state that nationals from outside the European Union should not replace resident actors capable of doing the same work. A spokesperson for the BBC responded: [...] "After due consideration, Dalip was deemed to be the most appropriate actor for the job." [...] Additionally, it was suggested that Madhur Jaffrey was miscast in the role of Dan's wife Pushpa.|$|E

In April 1933 the Cabinet agreed to follow through with the construction of the Singapore military base.|$|E

60|$|Down he fell, {{hands and}} feet extending, until with a jerk {{he was at the}} end of the rope.

2500|$|Ministry found {{mainstream}} {{success in}} the late 1980s and early 1990s with the albums The Land of Rape and Honey (1988), The Mind Is <b>a</b> <b>Terrible</b> <b>Thing</b> to Taste (1989) and [...] (1992), with the former of the two certified gold and the latter certified platinum by the RIAA. The band has been nominated for six Grammy Awards, and performed at several notable music festivals, including participating in the second annual Lollapalooza tour in 1992 and co-headlining Big Day Out in 1995.|$|E
2500|$|This period {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of divisions within the band, as rather than tour in support of Rabies, Ogre joined Ministry while they toured in support of their album The Mind Is <b>a</b> <b>Terrible</b> <b>Thing</b> to Taste; Ogre contributed guitars, keyboards, and vocals during the tour. Ogre had also began working with the Ministry side project Revolting Cocks. [...] Key was later quoted as saying of Ogre's involvement with Ministry and, later on, Martin Atkins' Pigface that he sometimes felt [...] "like a wife that's been cheated on".|$|E
2500|$|Due to the non-chronological story telling, {{other parts}} of Billy's life are told {{throughout}} the book. After being evicted from the radio studio, Barbara treats Billy {{as a child and}} often monitors him. Robert becomes starkly anti-Communist and a Green Beret. Billy eventually dies in 1976 after giving a speech in a baseball stadium in which he predicts his own death and claims that [...] "if you think death is <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing,</b> then you have not understood a word I've said." [...] Billy is soon after shot by an assassin with a laser gun, commissioned by the elderly Lazzaro.|$|E
60|$|This {{was what}} these good women proposed, and bade me leave {{the rest to}} them. I was at first sadly afflicted at the {{thoughts}} of parting with my children, and especially at that <b>terrible</b> <b>thing,</b> their being taken into the parish keeping; and then <b>a</b> hundred <b>terrible</b> <b>things</b> came into my thoughts, viz., of parish children being starved at nurse; of their being ruined, let grow crooked, lamed, and the like, for want of being taken care of; and this sunk my very heart within me.|$|R

"Dan," [...] said Elspie, as, {{seated in}} the summer-house after {{the arrival of the}} sportsmen, these two held a meeting, [...] "I have called you back to tell you of <b>a</b> very <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> which has been said of my dear brother Duncan, and which you must {{contradict}} at once, and then find out how it was that the false report arose, and have the matter cleared up." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{effect of}} this {{declaration}} upon its hearers was remarkable.

2500|$|... "Knock Knock" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Missy Elliott for Mass Confusion Productions, with additional production by Kanye West. Lee Hatim is also credited {{in the song}} because it contains excerpts from The Masquerader' 1975 single, [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>Terrible</b> <b>Thing</b> to Waste Your Love." [...] West previously sampled the track in his own demo recording, [...] "Apologize", which was later released on his 2005 mixtape Freshmen Adjustment. [...] "Knock Knock" [...] was recorded by Carlos Bedoya at The Hit Factory Criteria in Miami, Florida with further assistance from Marcella Araica. Scott Kieklak mixed the song, while mastering was overseen by Tom Coyne. Elliott also provided additional vocals.|$|E
2500|$|The follow-up, The Mind Is <b>a</b> <b>Terrible</b> <b>Thing</b> to Taste was {{supported}} by a tour from 1989 to 1990. Due to the complex nature of the album's drumming, a second drummer, Martin Atkins, was used. In addition to Atkins, a ten piece touring line-up was formed, consisting of Chris Connelly (keyboards and vocals), Nivek Ogre (vocals and keyboards), Joe Kelly (vocals and backing vocals) and guitarists Mike Scaccia, Terry Roberts, and William Tucker, with Jourgensen, Barker and Rieflin serving as the group's core members. This tour was documented on In Case You Didn't Feel Like Showing Up. Two singles, [...] "Burning Inside" [...] (for which a video was made) and [...] "So What" [...] were released from the album.|$|E
2500|$|... "Knock Knock" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{recording}} artist Monica, taken from her fourth studio album After the Storm (2003). It was written and produced by rapper-producer Missy Elliott and commissioned following the delay and subsequent reconstruction of Monica's 2002 album, All Eyez on Me. One out {{of a handful of}} tracks which Elliott contributed, the song incorporates elements of 1970s-style soul and quiet storm, as well as hip hop, and is built around excerpts of the record [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>Terrible</b> <b>Thing</b> to Waste Your Love" [...] as written by Lee Hatim and released by The Masqueraders in 1976. Rapper Kanye West, whose 2005 Freshmen Adjustment mixtape recording [...] "Apologize" [...] the track is based on, is listed as the song's co-producer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my boy, {{you hardly}} {{understand}} {{the extent of}} the exclusiveness of some Englishmen. Of course, it is not always so, but to some people, the idea of their sons or daughters marrying into a family of less rank than themselves appears to be <b>an</b> almost <b>terrible</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>As</b> I have told you, although the daughter of a clergyman, I was, when I became an orphan, obliged to go out as a governess." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 2009, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross was {{nominated}} for a BAFTA. According to The Times, Ross {{was nominated}} soon after he was banned. Melody Sachs complained about Ross being nominated so soon after the controversy in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, saying: [...] "I am amazed that Ross should get rewarded with a mouth like his. Nobody is saying he hasn't got talent, but what he did was so disgusting. Of course he is not worth the money, but he is good at his job. However, I don't think he should be rewarded so soon after what happened. It is like people are saying, 'Let's forget all about it and see what we can give him.' It is wrong and bad timing to give or even put up this guy for recognition when he has done such <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing.</b> It was unforgivable, really. I'm not angry, I just don't believe it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Emin {{frequently}} {{works with}} fabric {{in the form}} of appliqués – material (often cut out into lettering) sewn onto other material. She collects fabric from curtains, bed sheets and linen and has done so for most of her life. She keeps such material that holds emotional significance for later use in her work. Many of her large-scale appliqués are made on hotel linens, for example, It Always Hurts (2005), Sometimes I Feel So Fucking Lost (2005), Volcano Closed (2001) and Helter Fucking Skelter (2001). Hate And Power Can Be <b>A</b> <b>Terrible</b> <b>Thing</b> (2004), part of the Tate's collection of Emin's work, is a large-scale blanket inspired in part by Margaret Thatcher due to her involvement in [...] "an attack on 800 boys and men in the Argentinian navy" [...] and other women for example women who steals their friends' boyfriends, Emin says of this work [...] "about the kind of women I hate, the kind of women I have no respect for, women who betray and destroy the hearts of other women".|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{his time}} as vice president, Quayle was widely {{ridiculed}} {{in the media and}} by many in the general public, both in the U.S. and overseas, as an intellectual lightweight and generally incompetent. Contributing greatly to the perception of Quayle's incompetence was his tendency to make public statements that were either self-contradictory ("The Holocaust was an obscene period in our nation's history. ... No, not our nation's, but in World War II. I mean, we all lived in this century. I didn't live in this century, but in this century's history"), self-contradictory and confused ("I have made good judgments in the past. I have made good judgments in the future") or just confused (such as his address to the United Negro College Fund, whose slogan is [...] "A mind is <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> <b>thing</b> to waste," [...] where he said [...] "You take the UNCF model that what a waste it is to lose one's mind or not to have a mind is being very wasteful.
