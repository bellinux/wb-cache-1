40|$|We use the {{techniques}} of birational algebraic geometry and some combinatorial arguments related to weighted trees to study the structure of resolutions of compactifications of hypothetical counterexamples to the two-dimensional Jacobian Conjecture. We obtain especially detailed results for the Stein decomposition of such maps. We hope that our approach will inspire more birational geometers to seriously work on the Jacobian Conjecture. Comment: This is a major revision. The proof of the result of Domrina is rescinded due to a mistake. The paper is significantly expanded to include {{a number of new}} results and methods, including the determinants of weighted trees as well as some relevant adjunction and inversion of <b>adjunctio...</b>|$|E
40|$|P. N. Benton y University of Cambridge Abstract Intuitionistic linear logic regains the {{expressive}} power of intuitionistic logic through the ! (`of course') modality. Benton, Bierman, Hyland and de Paiva {{have given a}} term assignment system for ILL and an associated notion of categorical model in which the ! modality is modelled by a comonad satisfying certain extra conditions. Ordinary intuitionistic logic is then modelled in a cartesian closed category which arises as a full subcategory of the category of coalgebras for the comonad. This paper attempts to explain the connection between ILL and IL more directly and symmetrically by giving a logic, term calculus and categorical model for {{a system in which}} the linear and non-linear worlds exist on an equal footing, with operations allowing one to pass in both directions. We start from the categorical model of ILL given by Benton, Bierman, Hyland and de Paiva and show that this is equivalent to having a symmetric monoidal <b>adjunctio</b> [...] ...|$|E
