25|$|In {{the early}} days, the band cited Radiohead, Massive Attack, and Portishead, {{because of the}} {{combination}} of electronic sequencers with live instrumentation, sample manipulation, and female lead vocals. Lark is often compared to Diamanda Galas, Beth Orton, Portishead, Pram, and Bjork. Recently, the band prefers not compare themselves. As Inge Beckmann has expressed {{that she does not}} have a single artist in mind, when creating <b>a</b> <b>Lark</b> track.

25|$|North Dakota was {{far away}} from the centers of the hippie {{movement}} on the coasts of the United States, but this did not mean that the local students did not {{know what was going on}} with their peers at schools such as UC-Berkeley. The combination of tension between the students and the established powers, and the local and state governments' lack of experience in dealing with large gatherings of angry and drunk protesters led to the riot that would put Zap, North Dakota across the headlines of the U.S. newspapers and make it the lead story on the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. What started out as <b>a</b> <b>lark</b> turned into a riot that resulted in thousands of dollars of damage.|$|E

[...] Bolitho took a similar line in his 1943 book Combat Report, attesting to Hull's [...] "bubbling, unquenchable gaiety". According to Bolitho, Hull was [...] "possessed of a magic power of creating happiness in others; making them belittle their cares, of inspiring them with confidence, not simply in him but in themselves. Of imbuing them with his own abounding love of life. Where Caesar was, laughter was." ...|$|E

Shortly after, Goober and the Peas broke up, but Jack continued to play in other bands, such as the garage punk band The Go (he played lead guitar on their 1999 album Whatcha Doin'), The Hentchmen, and Two-Star Tabernacle. In 1997—allegedly on Bastille Day—Meg first began {{to learn to play}} the drums.

2500|$|The {{school has}} had two mascots.

[...] During the 1950s and 60s, the sycamore tree itself was used as Indiana State's mascot, with a student dressed in a tree costume. [...] However, as a tree does not lend itself well to an athletic mascot, especially considering Indiana State's in-state rivalries with the Ball State Cardinals and Butler Bulldogs, the university created an Indian mascot named Chief Ouabachi, and his Princess, in 1969.|$|E
