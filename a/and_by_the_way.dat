It uses the sequence B–D–E–A–A♯ as a bass line during the refrain, the chorus, and the bridge, and uses a chord progression of F♯–G♯m–E–B for the verses. The song is constructed in a verse-pre-chorus-chorus form, with a rapped bridge before the third and final chorus. Musically, it is [...] "energised" [...] by a highly syncopated synthesised riff, <b>and</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the repetitive lyrics and rhythm are highlighted during the bridge.
