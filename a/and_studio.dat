5|$|Wright {{designed}} the Taliesin structure {{two years after}} leaving his first wife and home in Oak Park, Illinois with a mistress, Mamah Borthwick. The design of the original building {{was consistent with the}} design principles of the Prairie School, emulating the flatness of the plains and the natural limestone outcroppings of Wisconsin's Driftless Area. The structure (which included an agricultural <b>and</b> <b>studio</b> wing) was completed in 1911.|$|E

5|$|A new {{critical}} {{edition of}} both BWV 243 and 243a {{was published in}} 1955 as Series 2, Volume 3 of the New Bach Edition. Although the D major version remained the standard for life performance <b>and</b> <b>studio</b> recordings, {{half a century later}} also the E-flat major version had been published in new editions adapted to performance, it had been recorded several times, and its composition history had been further unravelled.|$|E
5|$|After {{acquiring}} {{their own}} recording studio, the duo immediately {{started working on}} new material and assimilated themselves with music recording <b>and</b> <b>studio</b> equipment, as they sought to become more ambitious artists and less dependent on other producers. The two also became more accustomed to playing live, particularly Big Boi, and André 3000 significantly changed his lifestyle, as he adopted a more eccentric fashion sense, became a vegetarian, and stopped smoking marijuana. Having dropped out months before graduation, André 3000 also returned to high school to earn his diploma during the recording of ATLiens.|$|E

5|$|Another early {{subwoofer}} enclosure {{made for}} home <b>and</b> <b>studio</b> use was the separate bass speaker for the Servo Statik 1 by New Technology Enterprises. Designed as a prototype in 1966 by physicist Arnold Nudell and airline pilot Cary Christie in Nudell's garage, it used a second winding around a custom Cerwin Vega 18-inch (45cm) driver to provide servo control {{information to the}} amplifier, and it was offered for sale at $1795, some 40% more expensive than any other complete loudspeaker listed at Stereo Review. In 1968, the two found outside investors and reorganized as Infinity. The subwoofer was reviewed positively in Stereophile magazine's winter 1968 issue as the SS-1 by Infinity. The SS-1 received very good reviews in 1970 from High Fidelity magazine.|$|E
5|$|At the time, most British {{television}} drama {{was shot}} {{on a combination}} of film and videotape. Usually location shooting would be on film <b>and</b> <b>studio</b> work would be recorded on video. The effect of the change in medium from film to video (or vice versa) during a scene change in a programme could be jarring for some viewers. Boucher structured his scripts carefully so that all the Earth-based scenes would be shot on film on location and all the space scenes would be recorded on video in the studio hoping that the effect would give the space scenes a unique look. He was disappointed, therefore, to discover that Gridneff had decided to record the entire series on videotape.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Led Zeppelin {{were the}} world's number one rock attraction, having outsold most bands of the time, {{including}} the Rolling Stones. Presence, released in March 1976, marked {{a change in}} the Led Zeppelin sound towards more straightforward, guitar-based jams, departing from the acoustic ballads and intricate arrangements featured on their previous albums. Though it was a platinum seller, Presence received a mixed reaction among fans and the music press, with some critics suggesting that the band's excesses may have caught up with them. Page had begun using heroin during recording sessions for the album, a habit which may have affected the band's later live shows <b>and</b> <b>studio</b> recordings, although this has been denied by Page.|$|E

5|$|Daybreaker is {{the fifth}} studio album by British metalcore band Architects. It was {{released}} on 28 May 2012 in the United Kingdom and most of Europe and on 5 June 2012 in the United States. It was the last album to feature guitarist Tim Hillier-Brook, who left the band on 16 April 2012. Daybreaker was co-produced by the band and Ben Humphreys at Outhouse Studios in Reading, Berkshire, and used the same team <b>and</b> <b>studio</b> that were used for recording the band's third studio album, Hollow Crown. Daybreaker was praised by music writers for its variety.|$|E
