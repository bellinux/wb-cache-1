5|$|By 1850, it was {{no longer}} {{profitable}} for the Mint to strike cents, and on May 14, New York Senator Daniel S. Dickinson introduced legislation for <b>a</b> <b>cent</b> made out of billon, copper {{with a small amount of}} silver. At the time, it was widely felt that coins should contain a large proportion of their face value in metal. The coin would be annular; that is, it would have a hole in the middle. The Mint struck experimental pieces, and found that it was difficult to eject such pieces from the presses where they were struck, and that it was expensive to recover the silver from the alloy. Provisions for a smaller cent were dropped from the legislation that gave congressional approval for the three-cent piece in 1851. Numismatic historian Walter Breen suggested that one factor in rejecting the holed coins was that they reminded many of Chinese cash coins with their minimal purchasing value. A drop in copper prices in 1851 and early 1852 made the matter of a smaller cent less urgent at the Department of the Treasury, which supervised Mint activities.|$|E

5|$|Xenon is {{obtained}} commercially as {{a by-product of}} the separation of air into oxygen and nitrogen. After this separation, generally performed by fractional distillation in a double-column plant, the liquid oxygen produced will contain small quantities of krypton and xenon. By additional fractional distillation, the liquid oxygen may be enriched to contain 0.1–0.2% of a krypton/xenon mixture, which is extracted either by absorption onto silica gel or by distillation. Finally, the krypton/xenon mixture may be separated into krypton and xenon by further distillation. Worldwide production of xenon in 1998 was estimated at 5,000–7,000m3. Because of its scarcity, xenon is much more expensive than the lighter noble gases—approximate prices for the purchase of small quantities in Europe in 1999 were 10€/L for xenon, 1€/L for krypton, and 0.20€/L for neon, while the much more plentiful argon costs less than <b>a</b> <b>cent</b> per liter.|$|E

25|$|Exactly how {{psychological}} pricing {{came into}} common use is not clear, {{though it is}} known the practice arose during the late 19th century.

The story claims that pennies were not common currency at the time, and so Stone colluded with advertisers to set whole dollar prices <b>a</b> <b>cent</b> lower—thus guaranteeing that customers would receive ample pennies in change.|$|E

25|$|When {{it bought}} the Shawinigan Water & Power Company, Hydro-Québec {{acquired}} a 20% share {{of a planned}} hydroelectric facility at Hamilton Falls in Labrador, a project led by a consortium of banks and industrialists, the British Newfoundland Corporation Limited (Brinco). After years of hard bargaining, the parties reached a deal on May 12, 1969 to finance {{the construction of the}} power plant. The agreement committed Hydro-Québec to buy most of the plant's output at one-quarter of <b>a</b> <b>cent</b> per kilowatt-hour for 65 years, and to enter into a risk-sharing agreement. Hydro-Québec would cover part of the interest risk and buy some of Brinco's debt, in exchange for a 34.2% share in the company owning the plant, the Churchill Falls (Labrador) Corporation Limited. The 5,428-megawatt Churchill Falls generating station delivered its first kilowatts on December 6, 1971. Its 11 turbines were fully operational by June 1974.|$|E

500|$|This fact did {{not escape}} {{government}} officials, and when, in 1863, {{they attempted to}} restore coins to circulation, the use of bronze coins, which would not contain their face values in metal, was considered. In his annual report submitted October1, 1863, Mint Director James Pollock noted that [...] "whilst people expect a full value in their gold and silver coins, they merely want the inferior [...] money for convenience in making exact payments". He observed that the private cent tokens had sometimes contained {{as little as a}} fifth of <b>a</b> <b>cent</b> in metal, yet had still circulated. [...] He proposed that the copper-nickel cent be replaced with a bronze piece of the same size. Pollock also wanted to eliminate nickel as a coinage metal; its hard alloys destroyed dies and machinery. On December8, Pollock wrote to Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase, proposing a bronze cent and two-cent piece, and enclosing pattern coins of the two-cent piece that he had had prepared. According to numismatist Neil Carothers, a two-cent piece was most likely proposed in order to get as much dollar value in small change into circulation in as short a time as possible, as the Mint could strike a two-cent piece as easily as <b>a</b> <b>cent.</b>|$|E
500|$|Astounding was {{initially}} published by Publisher's Fiscal Corporation, {{a subsidiary of}} Clayton Magazines. The first issue appeared in January 1930, with Bates as editor. Bates aimed for straightforward action-adventure stories, with scientific elements only present to provide minimal plausibility. [...] Clayton paid much better rates than Amazing and Wonder Stories—two cents a word on acceptance, rather than half <b>a</b> <b>cent</b> a word, on publication (or sometimes later)—and consequently Astounding attracted some of the better-known pulp writers, such as Murray Leinster, Victor Rousseau, and Jack Williamson. [...] In February 1931, the original name Astounding Stories of Super-Science was shortened to Astounding Stories.|$|E
