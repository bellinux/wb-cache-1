40|$|Background: To {{investigate}} whether schizophrenia patients with both suicide <b>attempts</b> and non-suicidal self-harm have earlier age of onset of psychotic and depressive symptoms {{and higher levels}} of clinical symptoms compared to patients with only suicide <b>attempts</b> or without suicide <b>attempt.</b> Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, 251 patients (18 – 61 years old, 58 % men) with schizophrenia treated at hospitals in Oslo and Innlandet Hospital Trust, Norway, were assessed with a comprehensive clinical research protocol and divided into three groups based on their history of suicide <b>attempts</b> and non-suicidal self-harm. Results: Suicide <b>attempts</b> were present in 88 patients (35 %); 52 had suicide <b>attempts</b> only (29 %) and 36 had both suicide <b>attempts</b> and non-suicidal self-harm (14 %). When compared with nonattempters and those with suicide <b>attempts</b> without non-suicidal self-harm, patients with both suicide <b>attempts</b> and non-suicidal self-harm were more frequently women, younger at the onset of psychotic symptoms, had longer duration of untreated psychosis, and had higher levels of current impulsivity/aggression and depression. Patients with both suicide <b>attempts</b> and non-suicidal self-harm were more likely to repeat suicide <b>attempts</b> than patients with suicide <b>attempts</b> only. Conclusions: Patients with both suicide <b>attempts</b> and non-suicidal self-harm had different illness history and clinical characteristics compared to patients with only suicide <b>attempts</b> or patients without suicidal behavior. Our study suggests that patients with both suicide <b>attempts</b> and non-suicidal self-harm represent a distinct subgroup among patients with schizophrenia and suicidal behavior with their early onset of psychotic symptoms, high rate of repeated suicidal behavior and significant treatment delay...|$|R

5|$|After Washington issued his 1793 Proclamation of Neutrality {{he became}} {{concerned}} that Spain, which {{later that year}} joined Britain in war against France, might work in consort to incite insurrection in the Yazoo against the U.S., using the opening of trade on the Mississippi as an enticement. At that same time though, mid-1794, Spain was <b>attempting</b> to extract itself from its alliance with the British, and to restore peace with France. As Spain's prime minister, Manuel de Godoy, was <b>attempting</b> to do so, he learned of John Jay's mission to London, and became concerned that those negotiations would result in an Anglo-American alliance and an invasion of Spanish possessions in North America. Sensing the need for rapprochement, Godoy sent a request to the U.S. government for a representative empowered to negotiate a new treaty; Washington sent Thomas Pinckney to Spain in June 1795.|$|E
