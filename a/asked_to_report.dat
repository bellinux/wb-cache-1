5|$|The Hot Latin Songs chart (formerly Hot Latin 50 and Hot Latin Tracks), {{published}} in Billboard magazine, {{is a record}} chart based on Latin music airplay. The data were compiled by the Billboard chart and research department with information from 70 Spanish-language radio stations in the United States and Puerto Rico. Those radio stations were selected based on their number of listeners, and were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> their playlists for the week. This information was then entered to the Billboard computer system, and points were tabulated for each song. This data are compiled by Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems, which electronically monitors radio stations in more than 120 music markets across the United States. Before this chart's inception, the Latin music information on the magazine was presented only {{in the form of}} the biweekly album sales chart Top Latin Albums, which continues to be listed separately.|$|E

25|$|Visual {{extinction}} {{has also}} been researched {{with regard to the}} effect of repetition on visual detection rate. Patients were shown a colored (red or green) letter (O or E), one to each visual field, and then asked variably to report the color or shape of one letter or the other. Extinction was found to be increased in the contralesional field when the patient was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> on a repeated characteristic – if both stimuli had been the same shape, or same color – regardless of whether the other characteristic had also been changed. This is another example of repetition blindness.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} framework {{has more}} recently been {{put forward by}} Wilken and Ma (2004) who suggest that apparent capacity limitations in VSTM are caused by a monotonic decline {{in the quality of}} the internal representations stored (i.e., monotonic increase in noise) as a function of set-size. In this conception capacity limitations in memory are not caused by a limit on the number of things that can be encoded, but by a decline in the quality of the representation of each thing as more things are added to memory. In their 2004 experiments, they varied color, spatial frequency, and orientation of objects stored in VSTM using a signal detection theory approach (see also the closely related work by Palmer, 1990). The participants were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> differences between the visual stimuli presented to them in consecutive order. The investigators found that different stimuli were encoded independently and in parallel, and that the major factor limiting report performance was neuronal noise (which is a function of visual set-size).|$|E
25|$|In 2011, The Journal of Bone and Mineral Research {{published}} a meta-analysis examining whether milk consumption might protect against hip fracture in middle-aged and older adults. Studies {{could find no}} association between drinking milk and lower rates of fractures. In 2014, JAMA Pediatrics {{published a}} report after monitoring almost 100,000 men and women {{for more than two}} decades. Subjects were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> on how much milk they had consumed as teenagers, and were followed {{to see if there is}} any association with a reduced chance of hip fractures later in life, it found there was not any. A study published in The BMJ that followed more than 45,000 men and 61,000 women in Sweden age 39 and older had similar results. Milk consumption in adults was associated with no protection for men, and an increased risk of fractures in women. The risk of any bone fracture increased 16 percent in women who drank three or more glasses daily, and the risk of a broken hip increased 60 percent. It was also associated with an increased risk of death in both sexes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{data from}} two experiments, both using stimuli {{simulating}} orthographically rotating surfaces, are presented, {{with the primary}} variable of interest being whether {{the magnitude of the}} simulated gradient was from expanding vs. contracting motion. One experiment <b>asked</b> observers <b>to</b> <b>report</b> the apparent slant of the rotating surface, using a gauge figure. The other experiment <b>asked</b> observers <b>to</b> <b>report</b> the angular velocity, using a comparison rotating sphere. The results from both experiments clearly show that observers are less sensitive to expanding than to contracting optic-flow fields. These results are well predicted by a probabilistic model which derives the orientation and angular velocity of the projected surface from the properties of the optic flow computed within an extended time window...|$|R

2500|$|As the {{hospital}} was nearing completion in 1815, the now famous convict architect Francis Greenway was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> {{on the quality of}} the work. He condemned it, claiming that it [...] "must soon fall into ruin". Short-cuts had been taken with the construction and there were weak joints in the structural beams, rotting stonework, feeble foundations, and dry rot in the timbers. Macquarie ordered the contractors to remedy these defects but by 1820 the southern wing was deemed particularly unsafe, with reports that some of it had collapsed and had to be rebuilt. Around this time, Greenway was commissioned to undertake repairs to both the wings of {{the hospital}}, including alterations to the roof of the southern wing and the rearrangement of its internal spaces. More substantial repairs were carried out on the southern wing in 1826. Many defects present from the original construction remained hidden away until the extensive restoration of the 1980s.|$|E
