5|$|According to Celtic mythology scholar James MacKillop, {{because the}} calves of water bulls <b>and</b> <b>ordinary</b> cows might bring {{disaster}} to the herd, {{they are supposed}} to be killed at birth; it is impossible to kill them by drowning, so other methods have to be used. Conversely, stories published in 1937 by the clergyman George Sutherland suggest these hybrids are considered to be of superior quality to normal pedigree cattle in the far north of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Controlled {{fermentation}} with microbes in brewing, wine making, baking, pickling and cultured {{dairy products}} such as yogurt and cheese, is used to modify ingredients to make foods with desirable properties. The principal microbes involved are yeasts, {{in the case of}} beer, wine, <b>and</b> <b>ordinary</b> bread; and bacteria, in the case of anaerobically fermented vegetables, dairy products, and sourdough bread. The cultures variously provide flavour and aroma, inhibit pathogens, increase digestibility and palatability, make bread rise, reduce cooking time, and create useful products including alcohol, organic acids, vitamins, amino acids, and carbon dioxide.|$|E

5|$|In addition, stars may be {{classified}} by the luminosity effects {{found in their}} spectral lines, which correspond to their spatial size and is determined by their surface gravity. These range from 0 (hypergiants) through III (giants) to V (main sequence dwarfs); some authors add VII (white dwarfs). Most stars belong to the main sequence, which consists of ordinary hydrogen-burning stars. These fall along a narrow, diagonal band when graphed according to their absolute magnitude and spectral type. The Sun is a main sequence G2V yellow dwarf of intermediate temperature <b>and</b> <b>ordinary</b> size.|$|E

It stands at what was for many years the western entrance to the city. It is known to have been operated as a tavern as early as 1815 by Joseph Nichols.|$|R

5|$|Researchers {{found out}} that very weak {{electromagnetic}} fields disrupt the magnetic compass used by European robins and other songbirds to navigate using the Earth's magnetic field. Neither power lines nor cellphone signals {{are to blame for}} the electromagnetic field effect on the birds, according to the new study published in the 8 May 2014 edition of the journal Nature. Instead, the culprits consist of frequencies between 2kHz and 5MHz, such as AM radio signals <b>and</b> <b>ordinary</b> electronic equipment that might be found in businesses or private homes.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{establishment}} of the revolutionary committee, however, a faction opposing Pan emerged and sought to remove him from power. Pan became involved in factional violence. He jailed people from the rival faction, including party members <b>and</b> <b>ordinary</b> people. His supporters and opponents fought each other in major armed conflicts, and Pan had serious disagreements with the local military leadership. In June 1971, the central government dismissed him from his posts and put him under investigation.|$|E

5|$|The Villalba attack inaugurated a {{long series}} of Mafia attacks in Sicily on {{political}} activists, trade union leaders <b>and</b> <b>ordinary</b> peasants resisting Mafia rule. In the following years many left-wing leaders were killed or otherwise attacked, culminating in the killing of 11 people and the wounding of over thirty at a May 1 labour parade in Portella della Ginestra. The Portella della Ginestra massacre was attributed to the bandit and separatist leader Salvatore Giuliano. Nevertheless, the Mafia was suspected of involvement in the bloodbath and many other attacks on left-wing organisations and leaders.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} Christianity in Scotland were {{probably}} among the soldiers <b>and</b> <b>ordinary</b> Roman citizens {{who lived in}} the vicinity of Hadrian's Wall. The archaeology of the Roman period indicates that the northern parts of the Roman province of Britannia were among the most Christianised in the island. Chi-Rho inscriptions and Christian grave-slabs have been found on the wall from the fourth century, and from the same period the Mithraic shrines (known as Mithraea) that existed along Hadrian's Wall were attacked and destroyed, presumably by Christians.|$|E
5|$|The station {{will have}} 24 {{platforms}} serving both high-speed <b>and</b> <b>ordinary</b> lines {{at a low}} level. The flats demolished for the extension would be replaced by significant building work above. The underground station would be rebuilt and connected to Euston Square tube station.

5|$|The water bull {{is said to}} {{reproduce}} with standard cattle, the resulting progeny distinguishable by {{the small size of}} their ears. According to some myths, the calves of water bulls <b>and</b> <b>ordinary</b> cows ought to be killed at birth by any method other than drowning– they cannot be killed by drowning– to avoid bringing disaster to the herd. Conversely, in northern areas the calves are considered to be of superior quality.|$|E
5|$|Bellman's poetry {{continued}} to be read and sung throughout the nineteenth century, contrary to the widespread belief among researchers that he was largely forgotten during this period. His songs were sung especially by the urban bourgeoisie and in fraternities, but also in aristocratic circles <b>and</b> <b>ordinary</b> people in the countryside. The , named after a phrase in Epistle 14, was founded in Uppsala in 1853; the song became their trademark. The Epistles and Songs were published in chapbooks, sung at festivals and performed {{in a variety of}} concerts and entertainments. Figures such as Fredman, Ulla Winblad and Movitz, as well as Bellman himself were painted on tavern walls and memorabilia such as plates, beer tankards and hipflasks. Curiously, Bellman was celebrated at least as enthusiastically in polite and abstemious circles, though with bowdlerized versions of the songs.|$|E
5|$|Bryce learns {{about the}} tunnel from his cellmate, {{and the two}} escape again. Emerging from the tunnel, they are met by Butler and a dog that attacks Bryce.

Black reveals that he knows Roe was once a promising student, and accuses her of being cowed by a fear of failure. Frightened, she reveals the location of Butler's farm. Police raid the farm, freeing several captive youths, including Bryce, but Butler is nowhere to be found.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{its initial}} {{focus on the}} elites, the Union was {{successful}} in raising funds from across French society. Schoolchildren <b>and</b> <b>ordinary</b> citizens gave, as did 181French municipalities. Laboulaye's political allies supported the call, as did descendants of the French contingent in the American Revolutionary War. Less idealistically, contributions came from those who hoped for American support in the French attempt to build the Panama Canal. The copper {{may have come from}} multiple sources and some of it is said to have come from a mine in Visnes, Norway, though this has not been conclusively determined after testing samples. According to Cara Sutherland in her book on the statue for the Museum of the City of New York, 90,800 kilos (200,000 pounds) was needed to build the statue, and the French copper industrialist Eugène Secrétan donated 58,100 kilos (128,000 pounds) of copper.|$|E
5|$|Each {{station was}} {{built as a}} one-storey {{building}} around a square courtyard. The side adjacent to the railway line was left open, and wings extended from the building along the platform on each side. Other than the brick platform faces, chimneys and foundations, the stations were built entirely of wood. Each station held first class <b>and</b> <b>ordinary</b> reception rooms for mourners, a first class and an ordinary refreshment room, {{and a set of}} apartments for LNC staff. The refreshment rooms at both stations were licensed (permitted to sell alcohol). The train crews would generally wait in these refreshment rooms until the trains were ready to return to London, and on at least one occasion (on 12 January 1867) the driver became so drunk that the fireman had to drive the train back to London. This incident prompted a complaint from the LSWR and from that time the LNC provided the train crew with a free lunch, provided they drank no more than one pint of beer.|$|E
