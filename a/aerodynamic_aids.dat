This {{partnership}} {{was responsible for}} the controversial 850 Estate racing cars, driven by Rickard Rydell and Jan Lammers and with a best qualifying placing of third and a best race finish of fifth, which was only rendered uncompetitive when the FIA allowed the use of <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>aids</b> in 1995. TWR then built and ran the works 850 Saloon, with six wins in 1995, and five wins in 1996, and a S40, with one win in 1997 in the BTCC, as well as Volvo placing third in the Manufacturers Championship, both in 1995 and 1996. In 1998, TWR Volvo won the British Touring Car Championship with Rickard Rydell driving the S40R.|$|E
25|$|The last {{appearance}} of an Eagle Mk1 in a Formula One race was when Pease privately entered 101 for the 1969 Canadian Grand Prix. Pease and the Eagle-Climax car suffered the ignominy {{of being the}} only car {{in the history of}} Formula 1 to be disqualified at a World Championship race for being too slow. The basic Mk1/Mk2 chassis design continued to be used in American National Championship races into the early 1970s. In common with most cars of the time, experimental wings and other <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>aids</b> - including the eponymous Gurney flap - were added to Terry's lithe chassis lines over the years, reducing the cars' visual impact and obscuring car's most noteworthy single design feature, the vestigial eagle's-beak nose.|$|E
25|$|The 1968 {{season was}} little better. Young talent Jacky Ickx won the wet 1968 French Grand Prix with his driving skills, but had few other successes. Things became more {{complicated}} {{during the season}} {{by the introduction of}} <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>aids</b> into F1, and their quick development. At the end of the season, the Scuderia Ferrari was only 4th in the Constructors' Championship, and there was also no success in sportscar racing as Ferrari did not take part at all in 1968. Manager Franco Lini quit, and so did Ickx, moving to Brabham. To provide for the future, during the summer of 1968, Ferrari worked out a deal to sell his road car business to Fiat for $11 million; the transaction took place in early 1969, leaving 50% of the business still under control of Ferrari himself.|$|E

Initially introduced by McLaren on the MP4-25, the F-duct is an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>aid</b> which causes the rear wing to enter a stalled state at high speed, reducing aerodynamic drag and increasing straight line speed.

Aerodynamic work was undertaken at the Motor Industry Research Association wind tunnel using a 1:4 scale model, as the project was unable to budget for a full-scale mock-up.|$|E

After {{teammates}} Jim Clark and Mike Spence were killed in early 1968, Hill led the team, and won his second world championship in 1968. The Lotus had a reputation of being very fragile and dangerous at that time, especially with the new <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>aids</b> which caused similar crashes of Hill and Jochen Rindt at the 1969 Spanish Grand Prix.

50|$|The Coupe's {{fixed roof}} {{increases}} torsional rigidity, {{resulting in a}} stiffness of 32000 Nm per degree of body twist on the coupe (compared to 14500 Nm per degree on the roadster), which improves turn-in and overall handling response. The roof has a 'double bubble' contour which serves as an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>aid</b> and offers more headroom than the roadster with top closed. The Coupé has a sleek fastback rear window that slopes down to an integrated spoiler shaped to deliver downforce to the rear axle at speed.|$|R
50|$|Full {{fairings}} cover both {{upper and}} lower portions of the motorcycle, as distinct from a half fairing, which only has an upper section, and leaves {{the lower half of}} the motorcycle exposed. The fairing on a race or sport bike is meant as an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>aid,</b> so the windscreen is rarely looked through. If the rider is sitting up at speed he will be buffeted by his rapid progress through the air and act as a parachute, slowing the bike, while if the rider lies flat on the tank behind the windscreen he generates much less aerodynamic drag. The high windscreen and handlebar width of a touring fairing protect the upright rider from the worst of this, and the windscreen is functional. Full fairings can also provide protection to the engine and chassis in the event of a crash where the fairings, rather than the engine covers and/or frame, slide on the road.|$|R

In the conventional design, the pilot's cabin is a different part of the aircraft than the nose. The stepless design is believed to help make the plane more <b>aerodynamic</b> thus <b>aiding</b> speed and fuel efficiency. The stepless design does however prevent the inclusion of a turreted gun position.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes {{the shape}} of the funnel is used as {{distinguishing}} feature rather than just the colour. Cunard fitted ships of its Saxonia class with streamlined round tops to the funnels. Intended as an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>aid</b> to keep exhaust clear of the deck the modification had very little practical effect but was retained because it made the four ships of the class immediately recognisable and gave Cunard a suitable modern image. There was a trend for 'designer funnels' on liners in the 1960s as fashion and aerodynamic advances combined to offer designers more options that the traditional cylindrical smokestack. The Italian Line fitted the liners Michelangelo and Raffaello with funnels topped by flat discs supported on exposed diagonal bracing while P&O's Oriana and Canberra had tall, thin funnels with aerofoil cross sections. [...] In the late 19th and {{the first half of the}} 20th century the number of funnels became associated with speed and reliability. For this reason a number of the great liners carried additional false funnels that they did not need. Examples included the White Star Line's , Hamburg America Line's , and later the French Line's [...] In most cases there was only a single false funnel placed as the aftermost of the funnels. The false funnels did have more uses than simply aiding aesthetics however - a stoker who survived the sinking of the Titanic escaped the boiler room by ascending the false funnel, the aft funnel of Normandie housed the passengers' dog kennels, and Disney Cruise Line's Disney Magic's forward funnel plays host to a teens-only club.|$|R

40|$|Modeling {{nonlinear}} unsteady {{aerodynamic effects}} in the simulation of modern fighter aircraft {{is still a very}} challenging task. A framework for approximating nonlinear unsteady aerodynamics with a Radial Basis Function neural network is provided. Training data were generated from a hierarchy of aerodynamic models. At the highest level, solutions of the discretized Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations provide the quantitative and qualitative solution of flow around aircraft, although the results are expensive in terms of computational resources. The Euler simulations are less expensive and provide qualitative data up to moderate angles of attack. The integration of these data is promising for generating accurate aerodynamic models at moderate computational cost. To illustrate the method, an airfoil undergoing pitching and plunging motion is considered. The primary and secondary aerodynamic model data are computed using RANS and Euler equations, respectively. A description for a mapping between the aerodynamic loads and the motion parameters based on the implicit function theorem is described. The mapping is then augmented by adding the secondary data to the input dataset. The selection of training data is then discussed. Once the network is trained, it can compute the unsteady aerodynamic loads from motion descriptions on the order of a few seconds. The framework is examined for different motions, and in all cases, the ROM predictions closely represent the actual aerodynamic responses. It is also demonstrated that the <b>aerodynamic</b> hierarchy <b>aids</b> in the rapid development of a reduced-order model...|$|R
40|$|The {{elongated}} tail of {{the male}} barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) is {{regarded as one of}} the classic examples of a male trait exaggerated by female choice. However, recently a hypothesis has been proposed suggesting that the streamers, or elongated outer tail feathers, may <b>aid</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> performance through the Norberg mechanism, providing lift at slow speeds and high angles of attack when the tail is fully spread. The possibility exists that the tail streamer has evolved under natural selection, sexual selection, or a combination of both selection pressures. We tested these three hypotheses by reducing the streamer length of free-flying swallows and measuring their aerodynamic performance, using stereo-video. Measurements of flight performance were made from the digitized three-dimensional flight paths. Five flight variables best described the individual variation in flight performance. Four of these five parameters - mean velocity, mean curvature, maximum agility, and mean rate change of curvature in the XY plane - had significant second-order polynomial relationships with tail streamer manipulation. The first and second principal components (from principal components analysis of the flight variables) also showed similar relationships with streamer manipulation. The combination of a curvilinear relationship between flight performance and streamer length and an aerodynamic optimum between 0 and 20 mm reduction is only predicted if both natural and sexual selection have been acting on streamer morphology. Our data therefore suggest that sexual selection has extended streamer length by around 10 mm beyond its aerodynamic optimum. We suggest that both natural and sexual selection have been important in shaping tail morphology in the barn swallow, and the relative importance of both selection pressures is discussed.

40|$|Parameters {{governing}} separation {{control with}} sweeping jet actuators over a deflected flap are investigated experimentally on a generic "Multiple Flap Airfoil" (MFA). The model enables an extensive variation of geometric and <b>aerodynamic</b> parameters to <b>aid</b> the scaling of this novel flow control method to full-size applications. Sweeping jets exit from discrete, millimeter-scale nozzles distributed along the span and oscillate from side-to-side. The sweeping frequency is almost linearly {{dependent on the}} supplied flowrate per actuator. The measured thrust exerted by a row of actuators agrees well with vectored momentum calculations. Frequency and thrust measurements suggest that the jet velocity is limited to subsonic speeds and that any additional increase in flowrate causes internal choking of the flow. Neither the flowrate nor the momentum input {{is found to be}} a sole parameter governing the lift for varying distance between adjacent actuators. However, the product of the mass flow coefficient and the square root of the momentum coefficient collapses the lift onto a single curve regardless of the actuator spacing. Contrary to other actuation methods, separation control with sweeping jets does not exhibit any hysteresis with either momentum input or flap deflection. A comparison between sweeping and non-sweeping jets illustrates the superior control authority provided by sweeping jets. Surface flow visualization on the flap suggests the formation of counter-rotating pairs of streamwise vortices caused by the interaction of neighboring jets. The actuation intensity required to attach the flow increases with increasing downstream distance from the main element's trailing edge and increasing flap deflection. No obvious dependence of the ideal actuation location on actuator spacing, flap deflection, angle of attack, or actuation intensity is found within the tested range. Comparisons between experimental and numerical results reveal that the inviscid flow solution appears to be a suitable predictor for the effectively and efficiently obtainable lift of a given airfoil configuration. The flap size affects the achievable lift, the accompanying drag, and the required flap deflection and actuation intensity. By controlling separation, the range of achievable lift coefficients is doubled without significant penalty in drag even when considering a safety margin for the maximum applicable incidence...|$|R
