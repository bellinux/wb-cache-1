5|$|Times Higher Education {{ranked the}} {{mathematics}} department tenth {{in the world}} in 2011. Duke's graduate level specialties that are ranked among the top ten in the nation include areas in the following departments: biological sciences, medicine, nursing, engineering, law, business, English, history, physics, statistics, public affairs, physician assistant (ranked #1), clinical psychology, political science, and sociology. In 2007, Duke was ranked 22nd in the world by Wuhan University's Research Center for Chinese Science Evaluation. The ranking was based on journal article publication counts and citation frequencies in over 11,000 academic journals from around the world. A 2012 study conducted by academic analytics ranks Duke fourth in the nation (behind only Harvard, Stanford, and MIT) in terms of faculty productivity. In 2013, Duke Law ranked 6th in Forbes magazine's ranking of law schools whose graduates earn the highest starting salaries. In 2013, Duke's Fuqua School of Business was ranked 6th in terms of graduate starting salaries by U.S. News & World Report. In the same year, a ranking compiled by the University of Texas at Dallas ranked Fuqua 5th in the world based on the research productivity of its faculty. The MEM (Masters in Engineering Management) program has been ranked 3rd in the world by Eduniversal In 2013, Forbes ranked Duke 4th in the nation in terms of return on investment (ROI). The ranking used alumni giving <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>criterion</b> to determine which private colleges offer the best returns. In 2017, Above the Law ranked Duke Law 4th in the nation in its ranking of law schools based on employment outcomes In 2013, Business Insider ranked Duke's Fuqua School of Business 5th in the world based on an extensive survey of hiring professionals. In the same year, Forbes magazine ranked Fuqua 8th in the country based on return on investment. In 2014, Duke was named the 20th best global research university according to rankings published by U.S. News & World Report and the University Ranking by Academic Performance published by Middle East Technical University. The U.S. News ranking was based on 10 indicators that measure academic research performance and global reputations. The University Ranking by Academic Performance uses citation data obtained from Thomson Reuters' Web of Science to rank universities based on research output.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of subcentres cannot {{be captured by}} an exponential function. Cubic spline functions seem more appropriate to depict the polycentricity pattern of modern urban systems. Using data from Barcelona Metropolitan Region, two possible population subcentre delimitation procedures are discussed. One, taking an estimated derivative equal to zero, the other, a density gradient equal to zero. It is argued that, in using a cubic spline function, a delimitation strategy based on derivatives is more appropriate than one based on gradients because the estimated density can be negative in sections with very low densities and few observations, leading to sudden changes in estimated gradients. It is also argued that using <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>criteria</b> for subcentre delimitation a second derivative with value zero allow us to capture a more restricted subcentre area than using <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>criteria</b> <b>a</b> first derivative zero.

In this study, induced antinociception by antidepressants (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram and zimelidine) was tested using the general opioid antagonist, naloxone and the kappa preferring antagonist, Mr 2266 BS. Antinociceptive activity of antidepressants in mice was assessed using the abdominal constriction assay.

500|$|Based on Bethe's {{intuition and}} {{fundamental}} {{papers on the}} subject by Shin'ichirō Tomonaga, Julian Schwinger, Richard Feynman and Freeman Dyson, it was finally possible to get fully covariant formulations that were finite at any order in a perturbation series of quantum electrodynamics. Shin'ichirō Tomonaga, Julian Schwinger and Richard Feynman were jointly awarded with a Nobel prize in physics in 1965 for their work in this area. Their contributions, and those of Freeman Dyson, were about covariant and gauge invariant formulations of quantum electrodynamics that allow computations of observables at any order of perturbation theory. Feynman's mathematical technique, based on his diagrams, initially seemed {{very different from the}} field-theoretic, operator-based approach of Schwinger and Tomonaga, but Freeman Dyson later showed that the two approaches were equivalent. Renormalization, the need to attach a physical meaning at certain divergences appearing in the theory through integrals, has subsequently become one of the fundamental aspects of quantum field theory and has come to be seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>criterion</b> for a theory's general acceptability. Even though renormalization works very well in practice, Feynman was never entirely comfortable with its mathematical validity, even referring to renormalization as a [...] "shell game" [...] and [...] "hocus pocus".|$|E
500|$|Verbal {{report is}} widely {{considered}} to be the most reliable indicator of consciousness, but it raises a number of issues. [...] For one thing, if verbal reports are treated as observations, akin to observations in other branches of science, then the possibility arises that they may contain errors—but it is difficult {{to make sense of the}} idea that subjects could be wrong about their own experiences, and even more difficult to see how such an error could be detected. [...] Daniel Dennett has argued for an approach he calls heterophenomenology, which means treating verbal reports as stories that may or may not be true, but his ideas about how to do this have not been widely adopted. [...] Another issue with verbal report <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>criterion</b> is that it restricts the field of study to humans who have language: [...] this approach cannot be used to study consciousness in other species, pre-linguistic children, or people with types of brain damage that impair language. [...] As a third issue, philosophers who dispute the validity of the Turing test may feel that it is possible, at least in principle, for verbal report to be dissociated from consciousness entirely: [...] a philosophical zombie may give detailed verbal reports of awareness in the absence of any genuine awareness.|$|E

East Sussex County Council, ex parte Tandy (1998), in which the reduction of home tuition services provided by East Sussex County Council to a young myalgic encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue syndrome) sufferer was challenged. The services were reduced due to {{a cut in the}} authority's home tuition budget. Lord Browne-Wilkinson, speaking for the House of Lords, noted that the statute in question in Barry had required the decision-maker to assess the [...] "needs" [...] of disabled people and whether arranging for home care services to be provided was [...] "necessary in order to meet" [...] those needs. The statute only listed the services that could be provided, and did not define what [...] "needs" [...] meant. Thus, it was [...] "perhaps not surprising" [...] that the court had laid down the availability of resources <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>criterion</b> for determining what should be considered [...] "needs". On the other hand, in Tandy the statute involved imposed on the authority a duty to arrange to provide [...] "suitable education" [...] to the applicant, which was defined according to [...] "wholly objective educational criteria". Financial resources were not mentioned at all. In the circumstances, the judge held that the extent of the latter was not a consideration relevant to the authority's decision. He also commented that since it had not been submitted that the authority lacked resources to perform its duty, this was a situation of the authority preferring to spend money on other matters. Thus, the authority could divert funds from discretionary matters and apply them to fulfil its statutory duty.|$|E
