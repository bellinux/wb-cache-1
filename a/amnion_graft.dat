30|$|Auto-cross {{hyaluronic acid}} gel [46] was {{proposed}} as {{a mean of}} prevention of IUA. <b>Amnion</b> <b>graft</b> following hysteroscopic lysis of IUA was recently proposed as another option in order to decrease recurrence of IUA after treatment and facilitate the re-epithelisation of the uterine cavity [47]. Further {{studies are needed to}} evaluate long term these options for both modalities.|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{evaluate}} long-term {{outcome and}} satisfaction of MacIndo surgery {{with and without}} <b>amnion</b> <b>graft.</b> Methods: This is a historical cohort study of patients who were treated with the McIndo procedure for vaginal agenesis. Participants answered a structured questionnaire to describe outcome in sexual function and satisfaction. Patient characteristics along with short and long-term endings were abstracted from the medical records. Results: Thirty-five patients responded to the questionnaire. Average age (±SD) at surgery was 28. 4 ± 3 years (range 17 - 48 years). The mean number of years (±SD) since surgery was 7 years (range 2 - 12 years). In 15 patients (42. 8 %) amniotic graft were amniotic graft were used only in is patients (42. 8 %). There was no relation between two types of surgery (long-term outcome and satisfaction with p-values of 0. 346 and 0. 758 respectively). Conclusions: Since {{there was not a}} statistical difference between these two types of McIndo methods, it is recommended to apply the procedure in which amnion is not used. This procedure (without <b>amnion</b> <b>graft),</b> is an easier method with less operation time and reduced viral (HIV…) transmission...|$|E
30|$|Having {{undertaken}} surgical adhesiolysis, it {{is recognized}} that recurrence is common and may occur in 30 to 66 % of women treated for IUAs [26, 53, 74 – 76]. Methods to reduce recurrence have been assessed by {{an increasing number}} of randomized trials using a variety of solid and semi-solid (gel) barriers. Traditional solid barrier techniques of separating the uterine walls following adhesiolysis include the use of an IUD, <b>amnion</b> <b>graft,</b> or stent, typically comprising an intrauterine catheter with an inflatable balloon tip. The use of gels such as hyaluronic acid and polyethylene oxide-sodium carboxymethylcellulose has also been subjected to more stringent investigation, and in total, five RCTs are currently evaluating outcomes for secondary prevention strategies.|$|E
30|$|A three-armed pilot RCT {{assessed}} fresh amnion versus dried <b>amnion</b> <b>grafts</b> versus intrauterine balloon alone [85]. Forty-five {{women were}} randomized (15 in each group), and each underwent diagnostic hysteroscopy 2 to 4  months following treatment. <b>Amnion</b> <b>grafts</b> reduced adhesions {{significantly more than}} the balloon alone (p[*]<[*]. 003), and fresh amnion was superior to dried amnion (p[*]<[*]. 05). Ten women (23 %) conceived with six (60 %) having a miscarriage.|$|R
30|$|We {{included}} the following types of randomized comparisons: any anti-adhesion barrier gel versus placebo, no barrier gel, or another type of barrier gel following operative hysteroscopy. We did not include studies of other anti-adhesion therapies, {{such as the use}} of human <b>amnion</b> membrane <b>grafting,</b> insertion of a balloon catheter or IUD, or hormonal treatment; this review focuses exclusively on the effectiveness of anti-adhesion barrier gels.|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the effect {{and value of}} amniotic membrane patches and grafts for acute ocular surface burn at different degrees. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 28 cases(28 eyes) affected by ocular chemical or thermal burn with different degree were included in our hospital from March 2007 to March 2012. Amniotic membrane patched was undergone in 13 eyes with fresh amnion that the patients corneal burns degree Ⅱ or Ⅲ with partial limbal buns at degree Ⅳ. Amniotic membrane grafts was performed in 15 eyes with fresh amnion that the patients all corneal burns at degree Ⅲ with the whole limbal necrosis without severe eyelid defect. The follow-up time ranged 6 ～ 24 mo. The postoperative visual acuity, the condition of amniotic membrane transplant, renovation of cornea and complications were observed. RESULTS: Postoperative corrected visual acuity was improved in 20 eyes(71 %), it was not changed in 5 eyes(18 %), the visual acuity declined in 3 eyes(11 %). The amniotic membrane survived in 23 eyes and the survival rate was up to 82 %. The cornea of 4 eyes recovered to transparent, nebula emceed in 8 eyes eventually, corneal macula emerged in 10 eyes, 4 eyes ended up with leukoma, 2 eyes developed corneal melting after therapy, then received lamellar keratoplasty. Corneal surface become epithelization after <b>amnion</b> patches or <b>grafts,</b> but any of them have recurrent epithelial erosion, and become stable epithalization after repeat operation. CONCLUSION: Amniotic membrane patches and grafts is an effective method to deal with acute ocular surface burn...|$|R
40|$|Background: The current {{traditional}} {{management of}} severe intrauterine adhesions (IUAs) is hysteroscopic adhesiolysis with application of either an {{intrauterine contraceptive device}} or a Foley catheter balloon with reported recurrence in up to 50 % of cases. Recently, significant improvement {{with the use of}} <b>amnion</b> <b>graft</b> following hysteroscopic lysis of severe IUA was reported. Case: In the present case, endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) were found within and on the surface of amniotic membrane two months after its grafting intrauterine which was confirmed with CD 10 immunohistochemistry. Conclusion: Amniotic membrane graft after hysteroscopic lysis of severe IUA, might act as a source of stem cells for endometrial regeneration; a role that will be of great value especially in severe IUAs. Further studies to confirm this finding are warranted...|$|E

Resident of Anesthesiology, Iran University of Medical Sciences Abstract Background: Epidermolysis Bolusa {{is a great}} {{challenge}} for all anesthesiologists. In this disease even indirect touch and pressure can cause boluses or wounds on skin and membranes of body. Case report: In this paper we introduce two Epidermolysis Bolusa patients who {{were brought to the}} operation room for the <b>amnion</b> <b>graft</b> of finger fusion. Conclusion: For anesthetic management of these patients, when surgery does not need muscle relaxation and mechanical ventilation, Ketamine is recommended for the prevention of airway manipulation...|$|E
40|$|Background: The Vagina is a {{composite}} structure formed partly from the mullerian duct and partly from urogential sinus. Most of the patients with mullerian agenesis have small rudimentary uterus without any endometrial cavity, 7 % - 8 % may have functioning uterus. Case: A 15 years old girl admitted with primary amenorrhea, cyclical abdominal pain, hematometra and complete vaginal agenesis. Surgical correction is the mainstay of treatment in patients with functioning uterus and absent vagina. Vaginoplasty was done to reconstruct a neovagina using <b>amnion</b> <b>graft</b> and establish uterovaginal continuity. In this case we have used only perineal approach to dissect the neovagina and identify the cervix with formation of a patent drainage tract and adequate vaginal length of 9 cm. Conclusion: In rare cases of obstructed functioning uterus by complete vaginal agenesis, vaginoplasty effectively restores anatomy and function by an overall minimal operative morbidity. Human amnion provides excellent results in neovaginal reconstruction...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{autologous}} sural nerve grafts {{is still}} the current gold standard for the repair of peripheral nerve injuries with wide substance losses, but with a poor rate of functional recovery after repair of mixed and motor nerves, a limited donor nerve supply, and morbidity of donor site. At present, tubulization through the muscle vein combined graft, is {{a viable alternative to}} the nerve autografts and certainly is a matter of tissue engineering still open to continuous development, although this technique is currently limited to a critical gap of 3 cm with less favorable results for motor function recovery. In this report, we present a completely new tubulization method, the <b>amnion</b> muscle combined <b>graft</b> (AMCG) technique, that consists in the combination of the human amniotic membrane hollow conduit with autologous skeletal muscle fragments for repairing the substance loss of peripheral nerves and recover both sensory and motor functions. In a series of five patients with loss of substance of the median nerve ranging 3 - 5 cm at the wrist, excellent results graded as S 4 in two cases, S 3 + in two cases, and S 3 in one case; M 4 in four cases and M 3 in one case were achieved. No iatrogenic damage due to withdrawal of a healthy nerve from donor site was observed. This technique allows to repair extensive loss of substance up to 5 cm with a good sensory and motor recovery. The AMCG thus may be considered a reasonable alternative to traditional nerve autograft in selected clinical conditions...|$|R
30|$|The {{use of a}} Foley {{catheter}} for 3 to 10  days following surgical lysis of IUAs {{is similarly}} reported {{to act as a}} physical intrauterine barrier [7, 50, 56, 69, 83, 84]. A nonrandomized study compared the use of an inflated pediatric Foley catheter in place for 10  days postoperatively in 59 patients with that of an IUD in situ for 3  months in 51 patients [82]. There were fewer infections in the Foley group and a lower recurrence rate of IUAs as assessed using HSG [82]. Although amenorrhea continued in 19 % of women in the Foley group and 38 % in the IUD group, the fertility rate was relatively low in both groups: 20 of 59 (34 %) and 14 of 51 (28 %), respectively. In a study of 25 women with moderate to severe IUAs, use of a fresh <b>amnion</b> <b>graft</b> over an inflated Foley catheter prevented recurrence of IUAs in 52 % of women, although follow-up fertility data and complications were not reported [83].|$|E
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this paper is to assess the {{efficacy}} of the use of the intrauterine device (IUD) as an adjunctive treatment modality, for intrauterine adhesions (IUAs). All eligible literatures were identified by electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Additional relevant articles were identified from citations in these publications. There were 28 studies included for a systematic review. Of these, 5 studies were eligible for meta-analysis and 23 for qualitative assessment only. Twenty-eight studies related to the use of IUDs as ancillary treatment following adhesiolysis were identified. Of these studies, 25 studies at least one of the following methods were carried out as ancillary treatment: Foley catheter, hyaluronic acid gel, hormonal therapy, or <b>amnion</b> <b>graft</b> in addition to the IUD. There was one study that used IUD therapy as a single ancillary treatment. In 2 studies, no adjunctive therapy was used after adhesiolysis. There was a wide range of reported menstrual and fertility outcomes which were associated with the use of IUD combined with other ancillary treatments. At present, the IUD is beneficial in patients with IUA, regardless of stage of adhesions. However, IUD needs to be combined with other ancillary treatments to obtain maximal outcomes, in particular in patients with moderate to severe IUA...|$|E
