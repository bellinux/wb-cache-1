40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is the {{development}} of technological schemes of energy production for this industry in terms of energy efficiency. Technical solution that can reduce cost of the final production of meat production plant has been presented. The main idea of the tehnical solution is the use of turboexpander, which must be installed on gas reduction station near meat processing plant in the packet with the „air-water” gas – driven heat pump, which gas cooler serves as gas heating unit for the first stage of turboexpander. The thermal exit of gas engine serves as gas heating unit for <b>the</b> <b>second</b> stage of turboexpander and as heat energy generator for <b>the</b> plant <b>and</b> source of <b>the</b> heat for one of the evaporators of heat pump, as well. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>evaporator</b> of heat pump is connected with the cold consuming equipment of the plant. The electric energy, which is produced by gas engine is consumed by heat pump compressor and electric equipment of the plant. Electric energy, which is produced by turbo expander is transmitted to the electric grid. The proposed technical solution can be used to reduce natural gas consumption on meat processing plants <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cost of production of electricity, heat and cold...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to recent}} {{regulatory}} changes in Europe, CO 2 or R 744 {{is considered a}} serious alternative to be the suc-cessor of R 134 a for the AC-system of cars for the European market. Research into R 744 as a working fluid for automotive AC started in <b>the</b> early nineties <b>and</b> continues even today. There are still open is-sues in both design and control of R 744 systems, e. g. the choice of an expansion device that satisfies both cost and performance constraints, control in <b>the</b> sub-critical region <b>and</b> controling transcritical transients. In a Masters thesis project organized in cooperation with Daimler AG in Sindelfingen, these issues were investigated using a well validated model of an R 744 prototype system modeled using the AirConditioning Library by Modelon AB and Dymola from Dynasim AB. The preferred choice for the expansion device from a cost {{point of view is}} a two-stage orifice with a pressure-activated bypass for high load conditions. The solution with the two-stage valve is compared to a reference system that uses an electronically controlled valve that is controlled to the COP-optimal high side pressure. Unfortunately, the two-stage valve can ex-hibit both limit cycling behaviour and multiple steady states depending on the plant operation history, both undesirable properties. For the investigated system the drawbacks could be eliminated by proper control de-sign. Another problem that was investigated was the load distribution between a front- and a back seat evap-orator for a two-evaporator version of the same sys-tem. Again for cost reasons, the refrigerant side of <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>evaporator</b> is not controlled, instead flow is split between the two evaporators using a fixed expan-sion device for the rear evaporator...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{tries to}} analyze the thermo-fluid {{dynamics}} of compact two-phase loops with natural circulation which are mainly ruled by the heat input supplied to the evaporator. The objective is to understand if in small two-phase thermosyphons the heat transfer performances are only due to the heat transfer in the evaporator section rather than fluid-dynamic characteristics of all the loop. The results of the experimental analysis are obtained with water and FC 72 and with {{two different types of}} thermosyphons. The first type is characterised by the evaporator internal diameter much larger than the bubble diameter while in <b>the</b> <b>second</b> type <b>evaporator</b> <b>and</b> connecting pipes have diameter 4 - 5 times larger than the bubble diameter. For both thermosyphons capillary forces are not involved in <b>the</b> heat <b>and</b> mass transfer. It is shows how type A thermosyphon the performances are influenced only by the heat transfer regime in the evaporator section, but in type B thermosyphons, the performances are also influenced by the fluid-dynamic parameters of the whole loop...|$|R
