By coincidence, BettyX became a licensed nurse on the same day.|$|E
5|$|Hoffman met his wife, Tracy, in Buffalo, New York in 1992 {{where she}} was {{a real estate agent}} {{and a member of the}} National Football League's Buffalo Bills cheerleading squad.

5|$|Wyatt still owned a {{house in}} Tombstone with his common-law wife Mattie Blaylock, but she waited for him in Colton, where his parents and Virgil were living. During the summer of 1882, she sent Wyatt a letter saying she wanted a divorce. She had met a gambler from Arizona and he had <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> him. Wyatt, who {{did not believe in}} divorce, refused. She ran away with the gambler anyway, and he later {{abandoned}} her in Arizona.|$|E

5|$|During {{the penalty}} {{phase of the}} trial, Bundy took {{advantage}} of an obscure Florida law providing that a marriage declaration in court, {{in the presence of}} a judge, constituted a legal marriage. As he was questioning former Washington State DES coworker Carole Ann Boone—who had moved to Florida to be near Bundy, had testified on his behalf during both trials, and was again testifying on his behalf as a character witness—he <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> him. She accepted, and Bundy declared to the court that they were legally married.|$|E
5|$|Wheeler left Italy in November 1943 and {{returned}} to London. There, he resigned {{as the director of}} the London Museum and focused on organising the Institute of Archaeology, preparing it for its adoption of a new director, V. Gordon Childe, after the war. He also resigned as director of the Society of Antiquaries, but was appointed the group's representative to the newly formed Council for British Archaeology. He developed a relationship with a woman named Kim Collingridge, and <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> him. As she was a devout Roman Catholic, he officially converted to the religion, something which shocked many of his friends, who believed that he was being dishonest because he did not genuinely believe in the doctrines of the faith. He then set sail for Bombay aboard a transport ship, the City of Exeter, in February 1944.|$|E
25|$|Widow {{for many}} years, in 1933 Aspasia had a romantic {{relationship}} with the Sicilian prince Strabia, who <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> him. She was about to accept the proposal, when he died suddenly of typhoid fever.|$|E

From 1968–1971, Vince worked as a traveling cup salesman before joining his father's company, the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF, now WWE). Linda finished college in three years so she could graduate together with Vince. Their son Shane was born in 1970, followed by daughter Stephanie in 1976.|$|E
25|$|In 1882, Nietzsche {{published}} {{the first part}} of The Gay Science. That year he also met Lou Andreas-Salomé, through Malwida von Meysenbug and Paul Rée. Nietzsche and Salomé spent the summer together in Tautenburg in Thuringia, often with Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth as a chaperone. Nietzsche, however, regarded Salomé less as an equal partner than as a gifted student. Salomé reports that he <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> him on three separate occasions and that she refused, though the reliability of her reports of events has come into question. Nietzsche's relationship with Rée and Salomé broke up in the winter of 1882–1883, partially because of intrigues conducted by Elisabeth. The trio had had plans to establish an educational commune in an abandoned monastery, but the idea was abandoned. Amidst renewed bouts of illness, living in near-isolation after a falling out with his mother and sister regarding Salomé, Nietzsche fled to Rapallo, where he wrote {{the first part of}} Thus Spoke Zarathustra in only ten days.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, Toole {{graduated}} from Tulane with honors. He enrolled in Columbia University in New York on a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship to study English literature. He {{took on a}} heavy workload {{so that he could}} earn his master's degree in a single year. In his free time he dated Ruth Kathmann, another student from Tulane, who was studying journalism at Columbia. The couple would go dancing at the Roseland Ballroom, as the $2.00 entrance fee allowed them to dance all night and suited their limited budget. Toole was noted to be a talented dancer. There is some question as to whether they were engaged, with friends claiming they were but Kathmann saying only that Toole <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> him, but she declined. After he returned to New Orleans they rarely saw each other, and she married another man. Toole wrote his master's essay on the Elizabethan poet John Lyly, which was made easier {{by the fact that he}} had also written his honors thesis at Tulane on Lyly.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Wilson {{remembers how}} {{he got a job}} at the local {{airfield}} thanks to Frank's dad. Frank quickly became a pilot, but Wilson didn't have the money to get flight certified and as such became a mechanic and fixed planes. Regardless he was still happy in life and eventually asked Amelia to marry him, and she agreed. That evening Amelia told Lawrence, who strangely didn't say anything at all, and left to do some work in the field. When Frank found out about the wedding, he privately told Wilson to cancel it saying that Amelia would never settle for a quiet life in Bastion Falls. Wilson ignored his request, confident he would soon have his pilots license and would be able to fly her to the Big City. Suddenly the bell from the hilltop church begins to ring in the Dreamscape, and Wilson heads over there. Once he does he remembers how on the wedding day Amelia never showed up, and she was never seen again. Lawrence blamed her disappearance on Wilson, saying that this would never have happened if he hadn't <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> him.|$|E
25|$|Gardner's {{mother had}} died in 1920, {{but he had not}} {{returned}} to Britain on that occasion. However, in 1927 his father became very ill with dementia, and Gardner decided to visit him. On his return to Britain, Gardner began to investigate spiritualism and mediumship. He soon had several encounters which he attributed to spirits of deceased family members. Continuing to visit Spiritualist churches and séances, he was highly critical of much of what he saw, although he encountered several mediums he considered genuine. One medium apparently made contact with a deceased cousin of Gardner's, an event which impressed him greatly. His first biographer Jack Bracelin reports that this was a watershed in Gardner's life, and that a previous academic interest in spiritualism and life after death thereafter became a matter of firm personal belief for him. The very same evening (28 July 1927) after Gardner had met this medium, he met the woman he was to marry; Dorothea Frances Rosedale, known as Donna, a relation of his sister-in-law Edith. He <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> him the next day and she agreed. Because his leave {{was coming to an end}} very soon, they married quickly on 16 August at St Jude's Church, Kensington, and then honeymooned in Ryde on the Isle of Wight, before heading via France to Malaya.|$|E
25|$|Phil {{clashes with}} Sharon when she {{continually}} puts her work at The Albert before their relationship, {{only beginning to}} become more involved with the bar when she is unimpressed at his {{lack of interest in}} her work. Closing up one night after an event, two men break in and vandalize the bar, and when Sharon attempts to defend herself alone, she is severely beaten and left for dead. She is later hospitalised with a ruptured spleen, leaving Phil distraught, but he later admits to Shirley that he arranged for the men to scare Sharon at the bar, but believed the bodyguards that he hired for her would have protected her, and did not realise that she would be hurt. When Shirley confesses she still loves Phil, he spurns her advances and instead proposes marriage to Sharon after she regains consciousness. Unaware of Phil's role in her attack, Sharon accepts, but she later overhears the truth and begins plotting against him with Marcus Christie's (Stephen Churchett) help. However, she later changes her mind and asks Marcus to return all Phil's money to his accounts, unaware that Phil has seen them. After meeting with his accountant, Phil is angry and tells Shirley what he has discovered only for their conversation to turn to passion. However, Phil later decides that since Sharon is returning the money, it should not matter to him as he still wants to go through with the wedding. They later marry, but are oblivious to Shirley's bitterness, as she attempted to persuade him to be with her, rather than Sharon, only hours before the wedding. After the reception, Shirley enters their house and confronts them, leaving Sharon devastated when she realises Phil has been cheating behind her back even after he <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> him. However, she decides that she still loves Phil and wants to be with him. After Phil insults Shirley and makes hurtful remarks about the fling they had together, an enraged Shirley attempts to go for him, but Sharon stops her, and after a brief struggle, Phil is accidentally shot. He is then rushed to hospital, Shirley fleeing {{with the help of her}} aunt, Babe Smith (Annette Badland). When Ronnie discovers her gun was used after Shirley stole it, Ronnie asks Jay and Ben to dispose of it.|$|E

Edith replied that she had already accepted the proposal of George Field, the brother of one of her closest schoolfriends.

500|$|The {{personal}} relationships of Michael Jackson {{have been the}} subject of public and media attention for several decades. He was introduced to the topic of sexual activity at age nine while a member of The Jackson 5. He and his brothers would perform at strip clubs, sharing the bill with female strippers and drag queens, and the sexual adventures of his brothers with groupies further affected Jackson's early life. The entertainer said his [...] "first real date" [...] was with the child actress Tatum O'Neal, when he was a teenager in the 1970s; he called her [...] "my first love - after Diana [...]" [...] The pair eventually [...] "cooled off" [...] and Jackson entered into a romance with model Brooke Shields in 1981. Although the relationship became largely platonic, Shields said there were times he had <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> him. As they grew older, the two saw each other less.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1824, Mary Shelley moved to Kentish Town in north London to be near Jane Williams. She may have been, {{in the words of}} her biographer Muriel Spark, [...] "a little in love" [...] with Jane. Jane later disillusioned her by gossiping that Percy had {{preferred}} her to Mary, owing to Mary's inadequacy as a wife. At around this time, Mary Shelley was working on her novel, The Last Man (1826); and she assisted a series of friends who were writing memoirs of Byron and Percy Shelley—the beginnings of her attempts to immortalise her husband. She also met the American actor John Howard Payne and the American writer Washington Irving, who intrigued her. Payne {{fell in love with her}} and in 1826 <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> him. She refused, saying that after being married to one genius, she could only marry another. Payne accepted the rejection and tried without success to talk his friend Irving into proposing himself. Mary Shelley was aware of Payne's plan, but how seriously she took it is unclear.|$|E
