5|$|The {{government}} initially {{followed through}} with this recommendation but the move was widely disapproved of by scholars of Japanese affairs including Cortazzi and {{thanks in part to}} their protests the Foreign Affairs Ministry eventually agreed to revive Japan Echo as an online magazine, which would be produced on an <b>annual</b> <b>basis</b> by whichever company put forward the best bid.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the rapid}} Muslim conquests of the 7th century, the Byzantine Empire found itself {{confined}} to Asia Minor, the southern coasts of the Balkans, {{and parts of}} Italy. As Byzantium remained the Caliphate's major infidel enemy, Arab raids into Asia Minor continued throughout the 8th and 9th centuries. Over time, these expeditions, launched from bases in the Arab frontier zone on an almost <b>annual</b> <b>basis,</b> acquired a quasi-ritualized character {{as part of the}} Muslim jihad (holy war).|$|E

5|$|Primary school {{teachers}} are general {{teachers who have}} received their training at either the University of Iceland or the University of Akureyri. The typical course lasts three years. Lower secondary teachers may also be trained at the University of Iceland. A BA or BS degree is required in this situation. The courses {{are designed to be}} both academic and practical. Municipalities are responsible for the employment of teachers. Optional in-service teacher training courses are offered on an <b>annual</b> <b>basis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sir Robert Menzies, the Australian politician, {{became the}} Lord Warden in 1965 and visited the castle on an <b>annual</b> <b>basis,</b> {{staying in the}} flat there. Elizabeth the Queen Mother {{followed}} Menzies in 1978, initially visiting the castle from the Royal Yacht, but from 1986 onwards taking over the entire castle for three days each July. This required moving furniture, silverware and other furnishings from London and caused difficulties for English Heritage, who managed the property. The current Lord Warden, Admiral the Lord Boyce, took up his post in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Eisenack's {{original}} {{description of}} the Chitinozoans placed them in three families, spanning seven genera, based on morphological grounds. Further genera were identified, at first on an <b>annual</b> <b>basis,</b> as time progressed. Since its publication in 1931, Eisenack's original classification has been much honed by these additional discoveries, as well as advances in microscopy. The advent of the scanning electron microscope in the 1970s allowed the improved detection of surface ornamentation which is hugely important in identification - as can be appreciated by {{a comparison of the}} images on this page. Even the light microscope image here is of far greater quality than could have been achieved earlier in the century, using poorly preserved specimens and less advanced microscopes.|$|E

5|$|Although having reached legal {{retirement}} age in 1927, and thus unable {{to be offered}} another five-year contract, Murray was reappointed on an <b>annual</b> <b>basis</b> each year until 1935. At this point, she retired, expressing the opinion that {{she was glad to}} leave UCL, for reasons that she did not make clear. In 1933, Petrie had retired from UCL and moved to Jerusalem in Mandatory Palestine with his wife; Murray therefore took over as editor of the Ancient Egypt journal, renaming it Ancient Egypt and the East to reflect its increasing research interest in the ancient societies that surrounded and interacted with Egypt. The journal folded in 1935, perhaps due to Murray's retirement. Murray then spent some time in Jerusalem, where she aided the Petries in their excavation at Tall al-Ajjul, a Bronze Age mound south of Gaza.|$|E
5|$|Despite the odds, {{a sizable}} force had mustered in Europe under his banner, {{defeating}} Murad II's subordinates. Murad II's furious reply eventually smashed this upstart and, in 1422, began the Siege of Thessalonica and Constantinople. John VIII {{then turned to}} his aging father, Manuel II, for advice. The result was that he incited yet another rebellion in the Ottoman ranks — this time supporting Murad II brother's claim, Kucuk Mustafa. The seemingly promising rebellion had its origins in Asia Minor with Bursa coming under siege. After a failed assault on Constantinople, Murad II was forced to turn back his army and defeat Kucuk. With these defeats, the Byzantines were forced once more into vassalage — 300,000 coins of silver were to be delivered to the Sultan as tribute on an <b>annual</b> <b>basis.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} a zone of buffer states, Sigismund I of Hungary tried to draw the neighboring Orthodox rulers under his own suzerainty by granting them estates in his kingdom. For example, Stefan Lazarević of Serbia received Satu Mare, Baia Mare and Baia Sprie in modern Romania, and Mircea I of Wallachia was granted Făgăraş. Sigismund I {{was also the first}} monarch who recognized, in 1419, the legislative competence of the Estates in Transylvania. On his initiative, their assembly declared that in case of an Ottoman attack, every third nobleman and every tenth serf would take up arms. Indeed, from 1420 Ottoman attacks occurred on an <b>annual</b> <b>basis.</b> In this period many Saxon churches, and later the Székely churches of the Ciuc region, were fortified, which gave local architecture a distinctive appearance.|$|E
50|$|The UNH-IOL {{operates}} testing {{programs on}} an <b>annual</b> membership <b>basis</b> called consortia. Each consortium is {{a collaboration between}} equipment vendors, test equipment manufacturers, industry forums, and the UNH-IOL in a particular technology. The collaborative testing model is intended to distribute {{the costs associated with}} maintaining a high-quality testing program among the consortium members.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine how}} social {{security}} affects income distribution {{within the same}} generation in Japan. We first {{assess the impact of}} current pension programs on annual income distribution among the elderly, and then estimate the potential impact of post- 2004 Reform pension programs on lifetime income distribution. We show that social security substantially reduces inequality among the elderly on an <b>annual</b> income <b>basis,</b> but that it is mostly due to an income transfer from the young rather than redistribution within the elderly. We also confirm that the potential distributive impact of post- 2004 Reform pension programs on lifetime income is quite limited, compared to that implied by the analysis on an <b>annual</b> income <b>basis.</b> Moreover, we estimate the distributive impact of alternative pension reforms with a bend-point system or claw-back system, both of which have been applied in other advanced countries. Key words: social security, income redistribution, lifetime incom...|$|R

5|$|In {{terms of}} competitiveness, {{intensity}} and longevity, the Backyard Brawl with the Pittsburgh Panthers is West Virginia's fiercest and most storied rivalry. Separated by only 70 miles, the two universities have competed on a mostly <b>annual</b> <b>basis</b> since 1895 (beginning in 1920 and resuming again in 1943 after World War II). Although Pitt holds a 61–40–3 series lead, {{more than half}} of its victories in the Backyard Brawl came prior to 1952 when the Panthers dominated the series 34–9–1. The Mountaineers hold a 26–22–2 edge over the Panthers since 1962 when the series began to interchange annually between Morgantown and Pittsburgh. West Virginia has also won seven of the last ten meetings. Put on hiatus following the 2011 season due to conference realignment, the series will resume with four games running from 2022–2025.|$|E
5|$|Most farming {{was based}} on the lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, {{settlements}} of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams, allocated in run rigs to tenant farmers. They usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land, helping to offset some of the problems of extreme weather conditions. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective in heavy soils and cheaper to feed than horses. Obligations to the local lord usually included supplying oxen for ploughing the lord's land on an <b>annual</b> <b>basis</b> and the much resented obligation to grind corn at the lord's mill.|$|E
5|$|Nguyễn Ánh {{began by}} {{deploying}} his expanded and modernised naval fleet in raids against coastal Tây Sơn territory. His fleet left Saigon and sailed northward on an <b>annual</b> <b>basis</b> during June and July, carried by southwesterly winds. The naval offensives were reinforced by infantry campaigns. His fleet would then return south when the monsoon ended, {{on the back}} of northeasterly winds. The large European wind-powered vessels gave the Nguyễn navy a commanding artillery advantage, as they had a superior range to the Tây Sơn cannons on the coast. Combined with traditional galleys and a crew that was highly regarded for its discipline, skill and bravery, the European-style vessels in the Nguyễn fleet inflicted hundreds of losses against the Tây Sơn in 1792 and 1793.|$|E
