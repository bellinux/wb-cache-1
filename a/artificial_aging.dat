50|$|Gold is {{a favored}} {{electrode}} material for low-aging resonators; its adhesion to quartz {{is strong enough}} to maintain contact even at strong mechanical shocks, but weak enough to not support significant strain gradients (unlike chromium, aluminium, and nickel). Gold also does not form oxides; it adsorbs organic contaminants from the air, but these are easy to remove. However, gold alone can undergo delamination; a layer of chromium is therefore sometimes used for improved binding strength. Silver and aluminium are often used as electrodes; however both form oxide layers with time that increases the crystal mass and lowers frequency. Silver can be passivated by exposition to iodine vapors, forming a layer of silver iodide. Aluminium oxidizes readily but slowly, until about 5 nm thickness is reached; increased temperature during <b>artificial</b> <b>aging</b> does not significantly increase the oxide forming speed; a thick oxide layer can be formed during manufacture by anodizing. Exposition of silver-plated crystal to iodine vapors can also be used in amateur conditions for lowering the crystal frequency slightly; the frequency can also be increased by scratching off parts of the electrodes, but that carries risk of damage to the crystal and loss of Q.|$|E

40|$|High {{pressure}} die casting is a well known and cost effective technology for producing cheap and accurate parts in zinc alloys. The advantage of this fine accuracy is, however, often lost due to the bad creep performance of the hexagonal structure of the zinc alloys. Zinc components obtained by high {{pressure die}}-casting also suffer from the variation of their mechanical performances with time because of natural ageing effect that induces a redistribution of metastable phases. Concerning creep behaviour of Zamak 5 alloy, {{it was observed that}} the total strain during primary creep is influenced by ageing times; particularly it decreases continuously down to an asymptotic value for the longest ageing times. The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess whether, during creep tests, concurrent <b>artificial</b> <b>ageing</b> may occur that interferes with the creep behaviour of the alloy. For this reason, different <b>artificial</b> <b>ageing</b> times and temperatures were investigated in order to reach steady state microstructure and mechanical properties and subsequently to compare them with the standard parameters used during zinc alloys creep test.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate ageing-induced genetic changes and to establish physiological thresholds for loss of genetic integrity during ageing or storage of rice seeds. In the first experiment, seeds of 10 varieties of rice were subjected to <b>artificial</b> <b>ageing</b> in chambers conditioned to 55 °C and 72 ± 2 % RH for 72 hours. In the second experiment, seeds of 4 varieties of rice stored in the NACGRAB gene bank, Nigeria in 2011 at 5 ± 4 °C were compared with seeds of the same accessions freshly harvested in 2013. Data were collected on seed germination and seedling length to estimate the seed vigour index. Genetic changes during the ageing were evaluated by SSR markers using a Direct™ PCR kit. Genetic distance indices were computed using PAST™ software and percentage genetic integrity was estimated from the genetic distance matrices. At 72 hours of <b>artificial</b> <b>ageing,</b> seed germination percentage declined to 54. 2 % and vigour index 0. 8 coinciding with the lowest estimate of genetic integrity of 99. 5 %. The decline in percentage genetic integrity during the <b>artificial</b> <b>ageing</b> indicated a systematic ageing-induced genetic alteration.
