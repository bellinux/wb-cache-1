Fishes were captured from fifty ephemeral ponds of Castillos Lagoon basin, {{in the region}} of the Humedales del Este. We identified 13099 individual prey items extracted from 669 stomachs of the four captured species. In the studied system, <b>annual</b> <b>killifishes</b> represents the most abundant and conspicuous top predators. Killifishes are generalist key predators at the ephemeral ponds of the studied system, consuming mostly aquatic items. Zooplancton represented the bulk of the diet in the four analyzed species, followed by eggs, algae and diatoms. Insects are the next group in prey number, as follows: Diptera larvae (especially Chironomidae and Cullicidae), Ephemeroptera (especially Betidae), and coleopteran larvae (especially Dytiscidae). Acari are also important prey in number. The four fish species differ in diet composition and in diet richness. A general pattern of differences in diet richness among killifish species and demographic groups could be related to variations in body sizes.

40|$|Background: The {{cellular}} signaling {{mechanisms and}} morphogenic movements involved in axis formation and gastrulation are well conserved between vertebrates. In nearly all described fish, gastrulation {{and the initial}} patterning of the embryonic axis occur concurrently with epiboly. However, <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> may be an exception to this norm. <b>Annual</b> <b>killifish</b> inhabit ephemeral ponds in South America and Africa and permanent populations persist by the production of stress-tolerant eggs. Early development of <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> is unique among vertebrates because their embryonic blastomeres disperse randomly across the yolk during epiboly and reaggregate several days later to form the embryo proper. In addition, <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> are able to arrest embryonic development in one to three stages, known as diapause I, II, and III. Little is known about how the highly conserved developmental signaling mechanisms associated with early vertebrate development may have shifted {{in order to promote}} the <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> phenotype. One of the most well-characterized and conserved transcription factors, oct 4 (Pou 5 f 1), may have a role in maintaining pluripotency. In contrast, BMP-antagonists such as chordin, noggin, and follistatin, have been previously shown to establish dorsal-ventral asymmetry during axis formation. Transcription factors from the SOXB 1 group, such as sox 2 and sox 3, likely work to induce neural specification. Here, we determine the temporal expression of these developmental factors during embryonic development in the <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> Austrofundulus limnaeus using quantitative PCR and compare these patterns to other vertebrates. Results: Partial transcript sequences to oct 4, sox 2, sox 3, chordin, noggin- 1, noggin- 2, and follistatin were cloned, sequenced, and identified in A. limnaeus. We found oct 4, sox 3, chordin, and noggin- 1 transcripts to likely be maternally inherited. Expression of sox 2, follistatin, and noggin- 2 transcripts were highest in stages following a visible embryonic axis. Conclusions: Our data suggest that embryonic cells acquire their germ layer identity following embryonic blastomere reaggregation in A. limnaeus. This process of cellular differentiation and axis formation may involve similar conserved signaling mechanisms to other vertebrates. We propose that the undifferentiated state is prolonged during blastomere dispersal, thus functioning as a developmental stress buffer prior to the establishment of embryonic asymmetry and positional identity among the embryonic cells...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Mosquitoes that {{breed in}} {{temporary}} pools {{in remote areas}} that dry up seasonally are especially difficult to control through chemical or biological means. The <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> has been suggested {{as a means of}} eradicating the aquatic stages of mosquitoes in transient pools because they can maintain permanent populations in such habitats by undergoing suspended animation or diapause during the embryonic stages to survive periodic drought. However, very {{little is known about the}} predatory activity of <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> and their usefulness in mosquito control. Results The <b>annual</b> <b>killifish,</b> Nothobranchius guentheri, native to Tanzania, was used in this investigation. Food preference was tested under laboratory conditions by feeding juvenile killifish with 2 nd instar mosquito larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus in the presence of alternative food sources, such as rotifers and chironomid larvae. Semi-field tests were conducted by introduction of hibernating killifish embryos and juvenile fish to artificial ponds in an outdoor open environment that allowed natural oviposition of Cx. quinquefasciatus. Food preference studies show that N. guentheri preferred to prey on mosquito larvae than either chironomid or rotifers. When hibernating killifish embryos were added to ponds simultaneously with the addition of freshwater, the embryos hatched and fed on mosquito larval population resulting in complete elimination of the immature stages. The introduction of juvenile fish to ponds with high density of mosquito larvae resulted in total eradication of the mosquito population due to predation by fish. Complete biocontrol of the mosquito larval population was achieved in the presence of 3 fish per m 2 of pond surface area. Conclusions The <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> provides yet another tool that may be employed in the eradication diseases carried by mosquitoes through vector control, particularly in temporary bodies of freshwater. The fish can be conveniently transported in the absence of water in the form of hibernating embryos. Once introduced either as embryos or juveniles in ponds, the <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> can effectively reduce the larval population because of its aggressive predatory activity. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{complete}} their life cycles, vertebrates require oxygen and water. However, environments are not always forgiving {{when it comes to}} constantly providing these basic needs for vertebrate life. The <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> Austrofundulus limnaeus is possibly the most well described extremophile vertebrate and its embryos have been shown to tolerate extremes in oxygen, salinity, and water availability. This phenotype is likely a result of the <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> life history, which includes periods of temporary habitat desiccation and oxygen deprivation, and requires the production of stress-tolerant embryos that depress metabolism in a state of suspended animation, known as diapause. Over the past several decades, the basic morphology and physiology of <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> development has become better characterized. However, there are still basic cellular processes that remain to be described in <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> such as A. limnaeus. Specifically, changes in DNA structure, expression, and copy number are known to have profound impacts on the phenotype and survival of an organism. Little is known as to how A. limnaeus maintains genome integrity during cell stress, nor how the A. limnaeus nuclear and mitochondrial genomes may have evolved under the unpredictable conditions in which A. limnaeus thrive. Early <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> embryonic development is also characterized by a complete dispersion and subsequent reaggregation of embryonic blastomeres prior to formation of the embryonic axis. This unusual period of early development may provide a functional adaptation that allows <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> embryos to survive these extreme conditions. The overall goals of this project were to (1) characterize the ability of A. limnaeus to tolerate and repair DNA damage through enzymatic and developmental mechanisms, (2) to determine possible consequences of mitochondrial DNA sequence and copy number on the metabolism of A. limnaeus, and (3) to establish a draft genome of A. limnaeus for future comparative genome studies. The results of this project show that embryos of A. limnaeus have an impressive ability to survive and reverse high doses of DNA damage induced by ultraviolet-C (UV-C) radiation, especially when allowed to recover under photoreactivating light. Surprisingly, embryos that survived irradiation during blastomere dispersion phases were able to develop normally. Characterization of gene expression during embryonic development for genes important for axis formation and cellular differentiation suggests that A. limnaeus embryos may delay axis formation until several days after epiboly is complete, thus allowing time for cells that become damaged to be replaced by surrounding pluripotent cells. This outcome would represent first case of a developmental buffering stage in a vertebrate. A. limnaeus embryos are also unique in their mitochondrial response to anoxia. Whereas in other species the amount of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number fluctuates following extremes in oxygen availability, A. limnaeus embryonic mtDNA remains stable. Additionally, characterization of the fully sequenced A. limnaeus mitochondrial genome reveals possible evolutionary adaptations that may have facilitated dormancy and anoxia tolerance when compared to other species within the Order Cyprinodontiformes. The final chapter of this project characterizes the draft genome of A. limnaeus and I provide evidence suggesting that epigenetic DNA methylation that may be involved in regulating diapause...|$|E

40|$|The {{developmental}} {{pattern of}} the <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> Austrofundulus limnaeus is unusual compared to other fish. First, the cell movements associated with gastrulation are separated from formation of the embryonic axis. In addition, embryonic diapause can occur.

Maternal influences and incubation environment are the factors that determine entrance into embryonic diapause, but the molecular mechanisms that regulate diapause are still unknown.

Organisms inhabiting unpredictable environments often evolve diversified reproductive bet-hedging strategies, expressed as production of multiple offspring phenotypes, thereby avoiding complete reproductive failure. To cope with unpredictable rainfall, African <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> from temporary savannah pools lay drought-resistant eggs that vary widely in the duration of embryo development. We examined the sources of variability in the duration of individual embryo development, egg production and fertilization rate in Nothobranchius furzeri.

The number of previously laid eggs appeared to serve as an internal physiological cue initiating a shift from rapid to slow embryo developmental mode. In <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> extensive phenotypic variability in progeny traits is adaptive, as the conditions experienced by parents have limited relevance to the offspring generation.

40|$|Free-living aquatic embryos {{are often}} {{at risk of}} {{exposure}} to ultraviolet radiation (UV-R). Successful completion of embryonic development depends on efficient removal of DNA lesions, and thus many aquatic embryos have mechanisms to reverse DNA lesions induced by UV-R. However, little is known of how embryos {{that are able to}} enter embryonic dormancy may respond to UV-R exposure and subsequent DNA damage. Embryos of the <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> Austrofundulus limnaeus are unique among vertebrates because their normal embryonic development includes (1) a complete dispersion of embryonic blastomeres prior to formation of the definitive embryonic axis, and (2) entry into a state of metabolic depression and developmental arrest termed diapause.

Recovery in full-spectrum light permits efficient removal of {{the most common type of}} DNA lesion induced by UV-R: cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. Interestingly, whole-mount embryo TUNEL assays suggest that apoptosis may not be a major contributor to cell death in embryos UV-C irradiated during dispersion/reaggregation or diapause.

40|$|The {{intensity}} of mating {{competition and the}} potential benefits for female of mating with certain males can be influenced by several extrinsic factors, such that behavioral decisions can be highly context-dependent. Short-lived species with a single reproductive season are a unique model to study context-sensitive mating decisions. Through exhaustive sampling {{in the field and}} simultaneous choice tests in the laboratory, we evaluated operational sex ratio (OSR) and female mate choice {{at the beginning and end}} of the reproductive season in the <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> Austrolebias reicherti. We found seasonal change in both OSR and female mate choice. At the start of the reproductive season the OSR did not deviate from parity, and females preferred larger males. Later in the reproductive season, while the proportion of males in the ponds decreased, females became unselective with respect to male size. The particular biological cycle of <b>annual</b> <b>killifish,</b> where both life expectancy and mating opportunities decline sharply over a short timescale, could account for the seasonal change in female choice. Reduction in choosiness could arise from diminished reproductive prospects due to a decline in male availability. Moreover, as the end of the season approaches, any benefits of choosiness are presumably reduced: a female’s fitness will be higher if she mates with any male than if she forgoes reproduction and dies. Future work will disentangle the mechanisms underlying seasonal changes in mating preferences, notably direct responses to demographic factors, environmental cues...|$|E

40|$|The <b>annual</b> <b>killifish,</b> Austrofundulus limnaeus, {{may enter}} {{embryonic}} diapause at three distinct points of development, termed diapause I, II, and III. Previous studies suggest {{a role for}} steroid hormones in the regulation of diapause in <b>annual</b> <b>killifish.</b> This study concerns the hormonal and genomic components involved in the developmental decision to enter or escape diapause II from both a maternal and embryonic perspective. Steroid hormone levels were measured in tissues isolated from adult female fish that were producing either high or low proportions of escape embryos. Levels of steroid hormones were also measured in new fertilized embryos that {{were known to be}} on either an escape or diapausing developmental trajectory. In addition, cDNA microarray gene expression analysis was used to identify gene sequences that may be associated with the regulation of entry into diapause in this species. Decreases in maternal estrogen levels associated with aging are correlated with decreasing escape embryo production, but there is no direct association between measured steroid hormone levels and escape embryo production. However, maternal production of escape embryos is correlated with increased ratios of 17 ß-estradiol to testosterone in ovary tissue, and cDNA microarray gene expression analysis indicates differentially regulated sequences associated with escape embryo production in maternal tissues. Both of these independent measures suggest hormonal involvement in the regulation of diapause. Embryonic levels of steroid hormones in newly fertilized embryos are not correlated with entry or escape from diapause II, although incubation in exogenous cortisol and 17 ß-estradiol causes an increase in the proportion of escape embryos. Gene expression analysis again suggests hormonal involvement. Interestingly, genes involved in epigenetic control of gene expression though chromatin condensation are differentially regulated in both maternal tissues producing escape embryos, and in embryos on the different developmental trajectories. These data suggest that hormonal control of gene expression through alterations of chromatin condensation may regulate the decision to enter or escape diapause II...|$|E
40|$|Background: Diapause is a {{developmental}} arrest present in <b>annual</b> <b>killifish,</b> whose eggs {{are able to}} survive long periods of desiccation when the temporary ponds they inhabit dry up. Diapause can occur in three different developmental stages. These differ, within and between species, in their responsiveness to different environmental cues. A role of developmental plasticity and genetic assimilation in diapause evolution has been previously suggested but not experimentally explored. We investigated whether plastic developmental delays or arrests provoked by an unusual and extreme environment could be the ancestral condition for diapause. This would be in agreement with plasticity evolution {{playing a role in}} the emergence of diapause in this group. We have used a comparative experimental approach and exposed embryos of non-annual killifish belonging to five different species from the former genus Rivulus to brief periods of desiccation. We have estimated effects on developmental and mortality rates during and after the desiccation treatment. Results: Embryos of these non-annual rivulids decreased their developmental rates in early stages of development in response to desiccation and this effect persisted after the treatment. Two pairs of two different species had sufficient sample sizes to investigate rates of development in later stages well. In one of these, we found cohorts of embryos in the latest stages of development that did not hatch over a period of more than 1 month without mortality. Several properties of this arrest are also used to characterize diapause III in <b>annual</b> <b>killifish.</b> Such a cohort is present in control conditions and increases in frequency in the desiccation treatment. Conclusions: The presence of plasticity for developmental timing and a prolonged developmental arrest in non-annual rivulids, suggest that a plastic developmental delay or diapause might have been present in the shared ancestor of annual and non-annual South American killifish and that the evolution of plasticity could {{have played a role in}} the emergence of the diapauses.

40|$|Across {{the tree}} of life {{there is a great deal}} of {{variation}} in life cycles, life histories, and reproductive strategies. Explaining this diversity in terms of selective pressures and ecological conditions is one of the grand challenges within the field of evolutionary biology. Studying the extremes, or the ends on this spectrum of life cycle variation, can provide a fuller understanding of how different strategies evolve and allow for population persistence. My dissertation research is united by two themes - the evolution of reproductive mode, and adaptation to ephemeral and variable environments. Killifish, small oviparous fishes within the Order Cyprinodontiformes, have evolved an annual life cycle and are adapted to life in seasonally ephemeral aquatic habitats. The most prominent adaptation of these short-lived killifish are embryos capable of undergoing diapause (halting development) at one or more of three different stages during embryology and remaining buried in the soil for much of the year. In this dissertation I combine a phylogenetic, comparative, and experimental approach to study the evolution of this life cycle and how through embryonic diapause these fish have adapted to ephemeral and variable aquatic habitat. 	In chapter one I demonstrate convergent evolution of alternative developmental trajectories associated with diapause in African and South American killifish species. Adaptation to seasonal aquatic environments in <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> imposes strong selection during the embryo stage leading to marked diversification during a mid-embryogenesis period that is otherwise highly conserved during vertebrate development. In chapter two, I demonstrate that the embryos of an <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> Nothboranchius furzeri exhibit a combination of phenotypic plasticity and bet-hedging (a risk spreading strategy). Specifically, whether embryos enter diapause is influenced by environmental factors (temperature and light level) that vary seasonally but also exhibits a measure of intrinsic variability, even after controlling genetics and environment. In chapter three, I compile available evidence from the literature and my own comparative experiments and provide a plausible scenario for how an annual life cycle evolved through intermediate steps. Killifish are found in aquatic habitats that span a continuum from permanent and stable to seasonal and variable, thus providing a useful system in which to piece together the evolutionary history of this life cycle using natural comparative variation embedded in a phylogenetic context...|$|E
40|$|Diapause is a {{programmed}} {{state of}} developmental arrest that typically occurs {{as part of}} the natural developmental progression of organisms that inhabit seasonal environments. The brine shrimp Artemia franciscana and <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> Austrofundulus limnaeus share strikingly similar life histories that include embryonic diapause as a means to synchronize the growth and reproduction phases of their life history to favorable environmental conditions. In both species, respiration rate is severely depressed during diapause and thus alterations in mitochondrial physiology are a key component of the suite of characters associated with cessation of development. Here, we use these two species to illustrate the basic principles of metabolic depression at the physiological and biochemical levels. It is clear that these two species use divergent molecular mechanisms to achieve the same physiological and ecological outcomes. This pattern of convergent physiological strategies supports the importance of biochemical and physiological adaptations to cope with extreme environmental stress and suggests that inferring mechanism from transcriptomics or proteomics or metabolomics alone, without rigorous follow-up at the biochemical and physiological levels, could lead to erroneous conclusions...|$|E

40|$|Embryos of the <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> Austrofundulus limnaeus are {{routinely}} exposed to oxygen limitation during development and are extremely tolerant of anoxia. Importantly, tolerance of anoxia is not strictly associated with entrance into metabolic dormancy associated with diapause II, but rather any embryo {{will respond to}} anoxia by entering {{into a state of}} anoxia-induced quiescence. Hypoxia causes a reduction in the rate of development, reduced heart rates, and reduced capacities for metabolic enzyme activity in both aerobic and anaerobic pathways.

This suggests a contribution from anaerobic pathways to support early development. However, the specific pathways supporting this metabolism are unknown.

It was assumed that learning ability differs between populations when tested in young and old age along with their difference in captive lifespan. Additionally, association between cognitive ability and other life history traits was tested. It was found that: (1) {{there was no difference in}} the ability to learn spatial task between populations; (2) both populations had similar lifespan with no cognitive decay in older age, and older fish from dry region population had committed even less errors in the learning task than they did as young fish; (3) fish were able to effectively learn the task but (4) solitary fish had lower learning ability than group-reared fish; (5) longer- living fish were quicker learners; (6) high resting metabolic rate was associated with more effective learning; (7) hesitant fish found the food reward in learning task [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Embryos of the <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> Austrofundulus limnaeus {{can enter}} into {{dormancy}} associated with diapause and anoxia-induced quiescence. Dormant embryos are composed primarily of cells {{arrested in the}} G 1 /G 0 phase of the cell cycle based on flow cytometry analysis of DNA content. In fact, most cells in developing embryos contain only a diploid complement of DNA, with very few cells found in the S, G 2, or M phases of the cell cycle. Diapause II embryos {{appear to be in}} a G 0 -like state with low levels of cyclin D 1 and p 53. However, the active form of pAKT is high during diapause II. Exposure to anoxia causes an increase in cyclin D 1 and p 53 expression in diapause II embryos, suggesting a possible re-entry into the cell cycle. Post-diapause II embryos exposed to anoxia or anoxic preconditioning have stable levels of cyclin D 1 and stable or reduced levels of p 53. The amount of pAKT is severely reduced in 12 dpd embryos exposed to anoxia or anoxic preconditioning. This study is the first to evaluate cell cycle control in embryos of A. limnaeus during embryonic diapause and in response to anoxia and builds a foundation for future research on the role of cell cycle arrest in supporting vertebrate dormancy...|$|E
40|$|Embryos of the <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> Austrofundulus limnaeus {{can survive}} for {{months in the}} {{complete}} absence of oxygen. Survival of anoxia is associated with entry {{into a state of}} metabolic dormancy known as diapause. However, extreme tolerance of anoxia is retained for several days of post-diapause development. Rates of heat dissipation in diapause II and 4 days post-diapause II embryos were measured under aerobic conditions and during the transition into anoxia. Phosphorylated adenylate compounds were quantified in embryos during entry into anoxia and after 12 [*]hr of aerobic recovery. Rates of heat dissipation were not affected by exposure to anoxia in diapause II embryos, while post-diapause II embryos experienced a profound decrease in heat dissipation. ATP decreased substantially in both developmental stages upon exposure to anoxia, and all indicators of cellular energetic status indicated energetic stress, at least based on the mammalian paradigm. The rate of decline in ATP is the most acute reported for any vertebrate. The mechanisms responsible for cellular survival despite a clear dysregulation between energy production and energy consumption remain to be identified. Necrotic and apoptotic cell death in response to hypoxia contribute to poor survival during many diseases and pathological conditions in mammals. Understanding the mechanisms that are in place to prevent maladaptive cell death in embryos of A. limnaeus may greatly improve treatment strategies in diseases that involve hypoxia and reperfusion injuries...|$|E
40|$|Embryos of the <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> Austrofundulus limnaeus have unequalled ability among {{vertebrates}} {{to survive}} long-term anoxia. Surprisingly, these embryos can survive for months in anoxia despite a large-scale decrease in ATP levels {{during the initial}} hours of anoxic exposure. These conditions are known to trigger apoptotic cell death in mammalian cells {{as a result of}} ischemia or anoxia. Anoxia-induced induction of apoptosis was investigated in four developmental stages of A. limnaeus that differ in their tolerance of anoxia, and thus may respond to anoxia uniquely. Exposure to staurosporine was used to determine if A. limnaeus cells were competent to enter apoptosis via cues other than anoxia. Apoptotic cells were identified by TUNEL assays and by measuring caspase 3 / 7 activity. Exposure to 48 hr of anoxia did not induce an increase in TUNEL-positive cells and generally did not lead to an increase in caspase 3 / 7 activity. However, treatment of anoxic embryos with 10 μM staurosporine resulted in a significant increase in caspase 3 / 7 activity in both normoxic and anoxic embryos. These results suggest that apoptosis is avoided in embryos of A. limnaeus following exposure to anoxia at least in part by mechanisms that prevent the activation of caspase 3 / 7 activity. While this mechanism remains unknown, it may be triggered by a protein kinase that can be experimentally inhibited by staurosporine...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} temperature on growth of Austrolebias nigrofasciatus, an endemic and threatened <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> species of the Patos-Mirim lagoon system in Southern Brazil. In order to verify the effect of temperature on initial growth of A. nigrofasciatus, eggs stored in the laboratory were hatched and juveniles reared for eight weeks at 16 and 22 ºC. The standard length of newly hatched fishes was 4. 67 ± 0. 25 mm and after eight weeks they reached 23. 68 ± 3. 73 and 22. 68 ± 5. 36 mm, respectively at 16 and 22 ºC. However, initial growth of fish reared at 22 ºC was faster and they reached sexual dimorphism {{at an earlier age}} compared to those reared at 16 ºC. Final length of females reared at 22 ºC was 23. 00 ± 2. 83 mm, they were significantly larger than those reared at 16 ºC (17. 91 ± 2. 47 mm). Males were significantly larger than the females at 16 ºC, but there was no difference for growth between sexes of fish reared at 22 ºC. The sex ratios were 1 : 0. 6 and 1 : 1. 1 (M:F) at 16 ºC and 22 ºC, respectively, suggesting temperature determination of phenotypic sex. Considering the results, it appears that juveniles to be developed in captivity should be kept at 22 ºC during the first six weeks of life, thus ensuring a higher growth rate until puberty...|$|E
40|$|Small noncoding RNAs (sncRNA) have {{recently}} emerged as specific and rapid regulators of gene expression, {{involved in a}} myriad of cellular and organismal processes. MicroRNAs, a class of sncRNAs, are differentially expressed in diverse taxa in response to environmental stress, including anoxia. In most vertebrates, {{a brief period of}} oxygen deprivation results in severe tissue damage or death. Studies on sncRNA and anoxia have focused on these anoxia-sensitive species. Studying sncRNAs in anoxia-tolerant organisms may provide insight into adaptive mechanisms supporting anoxia tolerance. Embryos of the <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> Austrofundulus limnaeus are the most anoxia-tolerant vertebrates known, surviving over 100 days at their peak tolerance at 25 °C. Their anoxia tolerance and physiology vary over development, such that both anoxia-tolerant and anoxia-sensitive phenotypes comprise the species. This allows for a robust comparison to identify sncRNAs essential to anoxia-tolerance. For this study, RNA sequencing was used to identify and quantify expression of sncRNAs in four embryonic stages of A. limnaeus in response to an exposure to anoxia and subsequent aerobic recovery. Unique stage-specific patterns of expression were identified that correlate with anoxia tolerance. In addition, embryos of A. limnaeus appear to constitutively express stress-responsive miRNAs. Most differentially expressed sncRNAs were expressed at higher levels during recovery. Many novel groups of sncRNAs with expression profiles suggesting a key role in anoxia tolerance were identified, including sncRNAs derived from mitochondrial tRNAs. This global analysis has revealed groups of candidate sncRNAs that we hypothesize support anoxia tolerance...|$|E
40|$|Embryos of the <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> Austrofundulus limnaeus enter a {{state of}} {{developmental}} arrest termed diapause {{as part of their}} normal developmental program. Diapause can occur at two distinct developmental stages in this species, termed diapause II and III. When incubated at 25 °C, most embryos enter diapause II, whereas a small percentage of ‘escape’ embryos develop continuously past diapause II and enter diapause III. Control of entry into diapause II can be altered by maternal influences and the incubation environment experienced by the embryos. Young females produce a higher proportion of escape embryos than do older females. In addition, increasing the incubation temperature from 25 to 30 °C induces all embryos to escape from diapause. Surprisingly, escape embryos follow a different morphological and physiological developmental trajectory than do embryos that enter diapause II. Development of anterior structures is advanced compared with that of posterior structures in escape embryos when compared with embryos that will enter diapause II. The difference in timing of development for these two trajectories is consistent with changes observed between two species but is very atypical of variation observed within a species. Importantly, the two developmental pathways diverge early in development, during the segmentation period, when, according to evolutionary theory, constraint on developmental pathways should be relatively high. The possession of alternative developmental pathways in a vertebrate embryo is a novel finding, the ecological and evolutionary importance of which is still unknown, but potentially significant in terms of life-history evolution...|$|E
40|$|The <b>annual</b> <b>killifish</b> Austrofundulus limnaeus inhabits ephemeral ponds {{in regions}} of Venezuela, South America. Permanent populations of A. limnaeus are {{maintained}} by production of stress-tolerant embryos that {{are able to}} persist in the desiccated sediment. Previous work has demonstrated that A. limnaeus have a remarkable ability to tolerate extended periods of anoxia and desiccating conditions. After considering temperature, A. limnaeus embryos have the highest known tolerance to anoxia when compared to any other vertebrate yet studied. Oxygen is completely essential for the process of oxidative phosphorylation by mitochondria, the intracellular organelle responsible for the majority of adenosine triphosphate production. Thus, understanding the unique properties of A. limnaeus mitochondria is of great interest. In this work, we describe the first complete mitochondrial genome (mtgenome) sequence of a single adult A. limnaeus individual and compare both coding and non-coding regions to several other closely related fish mtgenomes. Mitochondrial features were predicted using MitoAnnotator and polyadenylation sites were predicted using RNAseq mapping. To estimate the responsiveness of A. limnaeus mitochondria to anoxia treatment, we measure relative mitochondrial DNA copy number and total citrate synthase activity in both relatively anoxia-tolerant and anoxia-sensitive embryonic stages. Our cross-species comparative approach identifies unique features of ND 1, ND 5, ND 6, and ATPase- 6 that may facilitate the unique phenotype of A. limnaeus embryos. Additionally, we do not find evidence for mitochondrial degradation or biogenesis during anoxia/reoxygenation treatment in A. limnaeus embryos, suggesting that anoxia-tolerant mitochondria do not respond to anoxia {{in a manner similar to}} anoxia-sensitive mitochondria...|$|E
