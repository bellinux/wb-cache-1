This report gives recommendations regarding reflection. diffuse reflection, colour. Dimensions of plates and types of letters and figures. Solutions for the problem of photographing the plates are also given. A number of requirements are not given in this report. These are of a technical nature and relate to resistance to impact. bending. vibration. corrosion and the effects of petrol. And also the requirements regarding adhesion of the reflectorizing coating and securing of the plates. An interim report on a number of findings from the investigations was completed in May 1968. These findings were elucidated for government authorities during laboratory and road demonstrations. arranged at SWOV's request by the Institute for Perception RVO-TNO (Visuology Department).
