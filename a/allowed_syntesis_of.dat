Title <b>of</b> diploma thesis: <b>Syntesis</b> <b>of</b> {{dexrazoxane}} analogues {{as potential}} cardioprotectants II ! Doxorubicin, daunorubicin and other anthracycline antineoplastic antibiotics {{are very important}} anticancer agents. Due to their high toxicity in the heart muscle, these highly effective drugs are often associated with acute cardiotoxicity and dose-dependent cardiomyopathy. This cardiomyopathy is characterized by enlargement of the left ventricle and complete systolic dysfunction. It is assumed that this side effect is mainly caused by reactive oxygen species, whose formation is catalysed by complex of anthracyclines and iron ions. The only clinically used drug that significantly reduce anthracycline cardiotoxicity is dexrazoxane (DEX). DEX is in vivo metabolised to a substance ADR- 925, which chelates the iron ions. DEX is also a catalytic inhibitor of topoisomerase II (TOP 2).

40|$|A Teacher Education (TE) on line {{laboratory}} {{offered an}} asyncrounous environment for “reflective experience” to students, in {{a framework of}} blended education. This has been the context for a research project based on four topics. •	Professional Identity that receives increasing attention {{in the field of}} TE (Korthagen 2004; Berry et al. 2007); •	Collaboration as a key aspect for teacher's culture (Woods et al., 1997). •	Case based pedagogy that is one way of effectively integrating learning with practice (Ben Peretz & Kupferberg, 2007) and providing student teachers with opportunities to develop “professional” ways of acting (Harrington et al., 1996). •	On line, asinchronous, text-based environments that foster communities of inquiry' buildings (Garrison, Anderson, 2003). The research has two aims: 	to explore different constructions of professional profiles in pre-service and in-service teacher-students, pre-post case-work activities; 	to analyse the nature of web forum interactions among future teachers and in-service teachers and specifically social cognitive processes. The subjects are: 18 subjects in-service teachers, 29 traditional students. They worked on line for three months. The activities were: 1. 	the students wrote individually a profile {{of what it means to}} be a “good teacher”, before and at the end of the case-work; 2. 	remembering their scholastic experiences, the subjects shared and built one problematic real life case; 3. 	they discussed and justified different solutions and wrote a <b>syntesis</b> <b>of</b> these. Data analysis was conducted in three moments: 	We applied the Specificity Analysis and the Correspondence Analysis to the pre-post profiles, through a software of text analysis. 	Using Garrison and Anderson’s content categories two researchers coded the social, cognitive and teaching discussion segments. They established an interrater reliability of 84 %. We calculated density figures for each forum. 	Using the Harrington's coding system (1996), we identified the specific aspect of critical reflection of teachers in the written <b>syntesis</b> <b>of</b> cases. Pre-post text analyses have shown that at the end of the activities the students elaborated a more articulate profile than at the beginning. The content analysis of on-line discussions have shown: •a dialogical co-constructive model of discussing in teacher-students vs a “strategic individualism” in in-service teachers; •an extremely embedded professional identity in teacher-students; •the emergence of a professional identity in pre-service students correlated with flexible, personal and social identities. The analysis of case works demonstrate that the students and the teachers solve their cases through different perspectives. The students’writings are student-centred but with references to authoritative and theoretical sources. The teachers’ perspective is more holistic, but the in-service teachers' analysis, and the solutions, are strictly based on experience and practical knowledge with no attempt to link the issue to the theoretical concepts...|$|R

Vicente Tofiño de San Miguel (1732 - 1795) and the Portuguese Mariano Miguel Franzini (1769 - 1861). The study follows the research embarked upon in 1991, which focuses on old maps of the Portuguese coastline giving a rather detailed depiction of the Lisbon area. The paper dwells briefly on the 16 th to 18 th century maps analysed in previous studies, presenting then the cartographic production of Tofiño and Franzini that was amenable to inventory. Their production is given against a <b>syntesis</b> <b>of</b> each of their professional backgrounds as technical, military and scientific officials. The representations of the Lisbon coastline in Tofiño's 1788 chart and in Franzini's 1811 charts are analysed and compared to present-day hydrographic charts.

Tofiño Spherical Chart (Carta esférica) shows few innovations in the patterning of the Portuguese coastline with the oldest known representations, which is not the case of the remaining charts in his invaluable Maritime Atlas of Spain (Atlas maritimo de España) (1789). The modern outlines of the Portuguese coast are in fact owed to Franzini, who produced both a Reduced Chart (Carta reduzida) and detailed charts. The comparison between current hydrographic charts and Franzini's charts emphasizes his accuracy in representing the coastline, with a considerable number of soundings that indeed enabled diagrammatic renderings of depth contours in the simplified charts shown in this study...|$|R

In this work, we report the further development in mustard carbonates chemistry. The influence of the leaving group on the anchimeric effect of sulfur mustard carbonates has been investigated both in autoclave and neat conditions.

Besides, a new family of half-mustard carbonate anisotropic electrophiles has been synthesized and their reactivity with aromatic nucleophiles has been investigated.

40|$|The interrelationship between {{prolactin}} (PRL) and {{the immune}} system have been elucitaded in the last decade, opening new important horizons {{in the field of}} the immunoendocrinology. PRL is secreted not only by anterior pituitary gland but also by many extrapituitary sites including the immune cells. The endocrine/paracrine PRL has been shown to stimulate the immune cells by binding to PRL receptors. Increased PRL levels, frequently described in autoimmune diseases, could depend on the enhancement of coordinated bi-directional communications between PRL and {{the immune system}} observed in these diseases. Hyperprolactinemia has been described in the active phase of some non organ-specific autoimmune diseases, as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and organ-specific autoimmune diseases, as celiac disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, Addison's disease, autoimmune thyroid diseases. In these diseases PRL increases the <b>syntesis</b> <b>of</b> IFNgamma and IL- 2 by Th 1 lymphocytes. Moreover, PRL activates Th 2 lymphocytes with autoantibody production. Of particular interest is the association between hyperprolactinemia and levels of anti DNA antibodies, islet cell antibodies (ICA), thyreoglobulin antibodies (TgAb), thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOAb), adrenocortical antibodies (ACA), transglutaminase antibodies (tTGAb) in SLE, in type 1 diabetes mellitus, in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, in Addison's disease and in celiac disease, respectively. High levels of PRL have been also frequently detected in patients with lymphocytic hypophysitis (LYH). Several mechanisms have been invoked to explain the hyperprolactinemia in LYH. The PRL increase could be secondary to the inflammatory process of the pituitary gland but, on the other hand, this increase could have a role in enhancing the activity of the immune process in LYH. Moreover, the detection of antipituitary antibodies targeting PRL-secreting cells in some patients with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia suggests the occurrence of a possible silent LYH in these patients. Finally, the role of anti-prolactinemic drugs to inactivate the immune process in LYH is still discusse...|$|R
40|$|Median {{micturition}} volume decreased early after partial outlet obstruction, 24 hrs total obstruction and hemidenervation. Degeneration {{release of}} transmitter may explain this, assuming that bladder wall distension causes nerve degeneration. Micturition pressure decreased simultaneously in the partially denervated and 24 hrs obstructed groups, {{probably due to}} the reduced number of functionally intact nerve terminals. Atropine resistance, not present in man, except in pathological conditions, increased early in all groups, but returned to normal with time, except in the 24 hrs obstructed group where it finally reached subnormal levels. Persistingly increased micturition volumes were found from 7 and 10 days after hemidenervation and 24 hrs total obstruction. This may be attributed to a non-recovery of afferent, sensory nerves after initial damage. However, micturition pressure normalized with time for both groups, suggesting a recovery of motor function. A 50 % increase was found in ganglion cell volume 7 weeks after contralateral ganglionectomy and an 80 % increase 6 - 8 weeks after inducing partial obstruction. The latter process was found to be reversible after removing the obstruction. It seems that there exists a maximal size of the ganglion cells. Heavy staining of LDH was found in pelvic ganglion neurons of both control and obstructed animals. A high capacity for glycolysis in anoxia could be expected in the nerves of the bladder under normal conditions as well as under obstruction. AVP concentration was decreased, but total AVP content increased in the partially obstructed bladder. Also, maximal response to AVP in vitro was significantly decreased and cystometry showed decreased excitability by AVP. These phenomena are parallel to those of substance P.

Although the correlation between Cu and N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Zn, Fe, Mn, B, Mo, Na and Al accumulation might be complex, it seems to depend on its interations {{at the level of}} the net uptake rate. In the roots, Cu concentration seems to be related metionine and/or histidine concentrations, in 30 and 8. 5 kDa proteins (as well as in 11 and 12 kDa polypeptides in 6. 25 mg/l Cu treatment) being immobilized in the vacuoles. In the shoots excess Cu seems to occur in a form or suborgenellar distribution which does no inhibit acid phosphate and cytocrome creductase activities and at least in part, it accumulates in the vacuoles and possibility sticks to the tonoplast. In both root and leaf tissues excess Cu decreases the conversion of SAM to ACC. Concerning to roots it is also suggest that the variations triggered excess Cu on root growth might be explained through the interaction among Cu uptake mechanism(s), plasma membrane H"+ ATPase and root membrane permeability. In the shoots it seems that non lethal toxic copper concentrations stimulate ascorbate, diamine and o-diphenol oxidase activities which might inhibit the biomas production.

The decrease of Mn and Fe concentration (triggered by excess Cu) seems to inhibit the <b>syntesis</b> <b>of</b> PT, PTF and PCh(ide) therefore inducing the decrease of carotenoids and chl concentrations, however, the sharp inhibition of Rubisco as well as inhibition {{at the level of the}} antenna chl a molecules of PSII might explain the observed decrease of net photosynthesis. Excess Cu also seems to inhibit the photo-synthetic electron transport mainly before the DPC donation site and, furthermore, decrease the contents of Pc and cyt f, whereas the PQ concentration sharply increased additionally, the leaf capacity for reduction of nitrate to amonia might also be primarily limited by capacibility of the chloroplast photo-chemical reactions to generate reducing power. With Cu levels greater than 0. 25 mg 7 l the poly-peptide bands with apparent molecular weights of 42 / 41, 33 / 32, 21 / 20 and 19 / 18 kDa decreased. Furthermore, the use of a discontinuous SDS buffer system gel elctrophoresis showed a decreased of the 56 / 55, 55 / 54, 26 and 22 kDa bands with increasing Cu concentrations, along with the disappearence of the 16. 5, 14. 5 and 12 kDa bands.

On the other hand, oxygen treatments were carried out to increase the oxidation state of the V 2 O 5 in the hybrid material. Higher temperatures and period of treatment leads to the decomposition of the organic part of the hybrid PAni/V 2 O 5.

Density-functional theory methods were used to predict the lattice parameters and atom positions of hte new polymorph material and those of Na 2 MnSiO 4 and LiNaMnSiO 4, allowing their identification by X-ray diffraction profiles, {{as well as the}} comparison of the measured and calculated cell parameters. The electrochemical activity of this new polymorph as a cathode material for lithium ion batteries was evaluated in coin cells and compared to that of the thermodynamically stable Pmn 2, polymorph of Li 2 MnSiO 4, as well as LiNaMnSiO 4 and Na 2 MnSiO 4. Carbon coating, very vital to the electrochemical activity of the material, was added in situ to the material before ion-exchange because the metastable polymorph converts to stable polymorph above 370 degrees Celsius, as confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry scans. Both LiMnSiO 4 polymorphs display similar charge-discharge curves, except for a marginally lower lithum extraction voltage during the first charge of the Pn structure that {{may be due to the}} presence of sodium ion impurities. A discharge capacity of 110 mA h g(to the power of) - 1 is intially observed for both Li 2 MnSiO 4 polymorphs and both exhibit similar capacity fades.

40|$|Esta pesquisa visa apresentar a articulação entre arte e política na trajetória de Mário Pedrosa durante as décadas de 1930 a 1950. Se, na conferência de 1933, sobre a gravurista alemã Käthe Kollwitz, Pedrosa esboçou os princípios de uma estética marxista, que tentou vincular a natureza, a origem e o desenvolvimento da arte com o estágio técnico alcançado pela sociedade e com a luta de classes, de 1942 em diante, a ênfase se deu na especificidade e nas leis próprias do campo artístico. Embora Pedrosa tivesse sempre em mente o processo final de síntese entre arte e revolução social, processou-se uma mudança em seu posicionamento. Este derivou não do afastamento premeditado da política para a dedicação exclusiva à atividade de crítica de arte, mas de um ajuste necessário de Pedrosa para {{articular}} de outro modo arte e política, a fim de que os augúrios do campo artístico se concretizassem.

40|$|The {{paper on}} "Social Issue - philosophical, {{political}} and legal reflection“ we present the theoretical basis of social policy and its impact in solving social issues. We are focusing {{on the issue of}} interdependence of the social policy and law and on the application dimension of law. We identify the highlighted issue from the position of the historical and logical methods, in which we analyze the causes of birth (of the social issues) in the past, and their „positive heritage“ inspiring current social scientific activities dealing with the social issues. Application of historical and logical method creates a space for comparative approach in which is logically justifies the priority or weaknesses in solving the social issues in the past and today. The aim of the highlighted issues is to point out the productive approach to its reflection, which consists in an organic bridging of the philosophical, {{political and legal}} knowledge gained by the analyzing of a limited range of social issues determined by us. Important is the recognition of the need for a functional bridge for the theoretical reflections (Philosophy and Policy) with legal practical and application approaches. Point {{to the fact that the}} law may not always be consistent with the fundamental principles of social policy: social justice, solidarity, as well as the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms. Highlighted (interdisciplinary) approach to the defining issue appears to us productive, in particular with regard to the complexity of the phenomenon of „Social Issue“. So-called partial approach from the point of view of philosophy, political and law, solves our issue only partially.

40|$|Articular {{cartilage}} (AC) is an aneural and avascular {{tissue that}} covers the ends of articulating bones in diarthrodial joints, and its main functions are to distribute joint loading and to provide nearly frictionless movement of the articulating bones. The mechanical properties of AC can be attribute to the complex structure of its extracellular matrix (ECM), mainly composed by collagen fibres, proteoglycan (PG) aggregates and interstitial water [1, 2]. Nowadays, the progression of mean expectation of life has highlighted {{the importance of a}} correct diagnosis for many age-related diseases. In AC, aging process occur in older age with cellular senescence [3, 4] and ECM modifications [5, 6], frequently involving in Osteoarthritic diseases [7 – 9]. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative joint disease and represent {{one of the most common}} disabilities cause (6, 6 % of Italian population, actually), posing a high economical burden to society. OA is characterized by the proceeding destruction of AC by uncontrolled proteolysis of ECM and typically leads to a remodeling of affected joints. No treatment neither early diagnosis method currently exist for OA pathologies, and the detection of differences and relations between early OA and aging is still an open field in clinical research [3, 8, 10]. To understand the progression of the disease, the comprehension of mechanisms involving on to ECM components during AC degradation is essential. The reduction of PGs concentration is recognized as the first symptom of degeneration in OA [11 – 14], while collagen fibers result more resistant from degradation. Using different experimental techniques, it is possible to observe the contribution of degradation of a specific macromolecule to the AC disease progression. Dielectric Spectroscopy (DS) resulted as an indirect indicator of collagen fibrils integrity through observation of intermolecular hydrogen bounds formation between water molecules [15]. Moreover, some water molecules result oriented along collagen fibers and that orientation is well recognized by Magnetic Resonance T 2 -weighted imaging (T 2 w-MRI) contrast variations through intra-molecular dipole interactions of water hydrogen nuclei[16 - 18]. The study of the dynamic of water molecules in cartilage resulted to provide information on cartilage structure [19 - 21]. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) [22 - 26] is a widely used Magnetic Resonance technique to investigate fiber microstructures in human brain, like in skeletal muscle tissue [27]. Moreover, some authors [20, 28, 29] have demonstrated that DTI technique can recognise collagen fibril orientation and other authors [20, 30, 31] have shown how the reduction of proteoglycan content in cartilage affect water Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC). For all the cartilage futures listed so far, and taking into account the potentiality provided by DTI investigations, here we monitored cartilage aging by means of DTI and T 2 -weighted imaging techniques. Specifically, starting to the observation that in cartilage is generally observed a reduction in water content during aging [32], we investigate in vitro cartilage samples during natural dehydration process. Moreover, we combined NMR with DS measurements to deeply investigate structural variation in cartilage matrix. [1] Zernia, G. 2006. Collagen dynamics in articular cartilage under osmotic pressure.

Both {{compounds}} {{were easily}} obtained in using an aromatic iodination reaction with molecular iodine. The desired products were isolated in nearly quantitative yields after a simple extraction. The crude materials are pure according to NMR. ### Introduction 4 –iodo– 2, 6 –dialkylanilines are useful {{building blocks for}} chemical synthesis as highlighted in several recent publications describing diversified applications: medicinal chemistry (1, 2, 3), materials (4) and ligand design for catalysis (5). These synthons are usually obtained by aromatic iodination of commercial 4, 6 -diiodoanilines. Most protocols imply the use of iodine monochloride, a hazardous fuming liquid (1, 4, 5), sophisticated reagents (benzyltrimethylammonium dichloroiodate (3, 6), [K(18 -crown- 6) ](ICl 2) (7) or molecular iodine {{in combination with other}} reagents (Ag 2 SO 4 (8) or iodic acid 2). However, almost 50 years ago, the first publication describing the aromatic iodination of 2, 6 –dimethylaniline (9) implied a much simpler procedure using molecular iodine, which is also less hazardous than ICl. However, the isolation of the desired was reported only in moderate yield after a lengthy steam–distillation. While repeating this experiment we discovered that the crude material quantitatively recovered prior to distillation was analytically pure and could be used for further reactions. This simple protocol was simply scaled up to about 100 g of 4 –iodo– 2, 6 –dimethylaniline and 4 –iodo– 2, 6 –diisopropylaniline. ![Fig 1]([URL] "Fig 1 ") ### Reagents 1. 2, 6 –dimethylaniline (liquid) - 2, 6 –diisopropylaniline (liquid) - molecular diiodine (solid) - diethyl ether - saturated aqueous sodium carbonate - saturated aqueous sodium thiosulfate - CDCl 3 for NMR sample preparation ### Equipment 1. balance - fume hood - 2 L two-necked round-bottomed flask - funnel - 2 L separation funnel - 1 L or 2 L round-bottomed evaporation flask - 100 mL dropping funnel - mechanical stirrer - rotary evaporator - high vacuum pump - large crystallising dish - NMR spectrometer and tubes for NMR characterisation ### Procedure **Synthesis of 4 -iodo- 2, 6 -diisopropylaniline** 1. Equip a 2 L two-necked flask with a mechanic agitator - Weigh out 119 g (0. 466 mol) of iodine in a 500 mL round-bottomed flask. Dissolve it in 400 mL of diethyl ether. Pour the resulting solution into a 2 L two-necked flask using a funnel. Wash the funnel with a minimal amount of diethyl ether. - CAUTION: if the balance is not inside a fume hood, iodine must be weighed in a stoppered flask. In this case, the zero of the balance must be set with the round bottomed flask and the stopper. The flask is then removed from the balance and iodine added inside a fume hood. The flask is stopper and weighed. This process is repeated until the desired mass is reached. - Add 1 L of a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. - Charge a dropping funnel with 80. 0 mL (75. 2 g, 424 mmol) of 2, 6 –diisopropylaniline. Add the aniline dropwise in the stirred reaction mixture (approximate duration: 5 min). Gas evolution is observed. - CAUTION: In the case the gaseous evolution becomes too vigorous, addition and stirring can be temporarily halted. - Stir vigorously the resulting biphasic mixture for 2 h. Gas evolution continues in the beginning of this period. - PAUSEPOINT: It is possible to check the complete conversion by thin layer chromatography (stationary phase SiO 2, elution with ethyl acetate/cyclohexane v/v 2 : 8 Rf(2, 6 -dimethylaniline) = 0. 60, Rf(4 -iodo- 2, 6 -dimethylaniline) = 0. 55) - Destroy excess iodine by addition of sodium thiosulfate until the aqueous phases becomes perfectly colourless. - PAUSEPOINT: The colour of the aqueous phase is better observed by temporarily stopping agitation. - Separate the ethereal layer and extract the aqueous phase with 200 mL of diethyl ether. - Wash the combined organic phase with 300 mL of water, dry it over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporate using a rotary evaporator. - Dry the resulting dark liquid in high vacuum overnight. - Characterise the oily product by 1 H-NMR in CDCl 3. **Synthesis of 4 -iodo- 2, 6 -dimethylaniline** 1. Equip a 2 L two-necked flask equipped with a mechanic agitator - Weigh out 119 g (0. 466 mol) of iodine in a 500 mL round-bottomed flask. Dissolve it in 400 mL of diethyl ether. Pour the resulting solution into a 2 L two-necked flask using a funnel. Wash the funnel with a minimal amount of diethyl ether. - CAUTION: If the balance is not inside a fume hood, iodine must be weighed in a stoppered flask. In this case, the zero of the balance must be set with the round bottomed flask and the stopper. The flask is then removed from the balance and iodine added inside a fume hood. The flask is stopper and weighed. This process is repeated until the desired mass is reached. - Add 1 L of a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. - Charge a dropping funnel with 52. 4 mL (51. 4 g, 424 mmol) of 2, 6 –dimethylaniline. Add the aniline dropwise in the stirred reaction mixture (approximate duration: 5 min). Gas evolution is observed. - CAUTION: In the case the gaseous evolution becomes too vigorous, addition and stirring can be temporarily halted. - Stir vigorously the resulting biphasic mixture for 2 h. Gas evolution continues in the beginning of this period. - PAUSEPOINT: It is possible to check the complete conversion by thin layer chromatography (stationary phase SiO 2, elution with ethyl acetate/cyclohexane v/v 2 : 8 Rf(2, 6 -dimethylaniline) = 0. 50, Rf(4 -iodo- 2, 6 -diisomethylaniline) = 0. 45) - Destroy excess iodine by addition of sodium thiosulfate with stirring until the aqueous phases becomes perfectly colourless. - PAUSEPOINT: The colour of the aqueous phase is better observed by temporarily stopping agitation. - Transfer the reaction mixture to the 2 L separation funnel. Separate the ethereal layer and extract the aqueous phase with 200 mL of diethyl ether. - Wash the organic phase with 300 mL of water, dry it over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporate using a rotary evaporator using a 2 L. - Pour the resulting oil in a crystallizing dish along with a minimal amount of diethyl ether to wash the flask. During the drying process 4 -iodo- 2, 6 -dimethylaniline crystallises. - CAUTION: Crystallisation, which is exothermic, may occur abruptly resulting in the dish to become hot. - Characterise the oily product by 1 H-NMR in CDCl 3. ### Timing - 4 –iodo– 2, 6 –diisopropylaniline: 4 h + overnight drying. - 4 –iodo– 2, 6 –dimethylaniline: 4 h + overnight drying. ### Anticipated Results Typical isolated yield for 4 –iodo– 2, 6 –diisopropylaniline 97 % (124. 7 g).
