25|$|The other {{exception}} {{has to do}} with {{a rather}} peculiar case of psychic phenomena, one which I find myself unable to classify.... I was brought in contact with it, in the summer of 1911, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> it under my observation more or less ever since, having been present at probably 250 of the night sessions, many of which have been attended by a stenographer who made voluminous notes. A thorough study of this case has convinced me that it is not one of ordinary trance.... This man is utterly unconscious, wholly oblivious to what takes place, and, unless told about it subsequently, never knows that he has been used as a sort of clearing house for the coming and going of alleged extra-planetary personalities.... Psychoanalysis, hypnotism, intensive comparison, fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind. Much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought, to the way in which he has been taught, and to his entire philosophy. In fact, of much that we have secured, we have failed to find anything of its nature in existence.|$|E
500|$|By early 1965 Josiffe was in Dublin, {{where he}} worked at various horse-related jobs while {{continuing}} to badger Thorpe by letter about his missing luggage and the continuing National Insurance card issue. However, Thorpe rejected any responsibility for these matters. In mid-March 1965 Josiffe wrote a long letter to Thorpe's mother, which began: [...] "For the last five years, as you probably know, Jeremy <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a homosexual relationship." [...] The letter blamed Thorpe for awakening [...] "this vice that lies latent in every man", and accused him of callousness and disloyalty. Ursula Thorpe gave the letter to her son, who drafted a quasi-legal statement rejecting the [...] "damaging and groundless accusations" [...] and accusing Josiffe of attempting to blackmail him. The document was never sent; instead, Thorpe turned to Bessell for advice.|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, Lloyd {{signed with}} {{expansion}} team Atlanta Beat for the 2011 season. Of her signing, Beat head coach James Galanis said, [...] "She {{is a fantastic}} midfielder and someone who is fully focused on the game. I have known her from her college days, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the opportunity to train her and improve her game individually. She has {{made a lot of}} sacrifices off the field to reach her dreams, and she is going to bring a lot of professionalism to the team." [...] Lloyd scored two goals in her ten appearances for the Beat. She scored the team's lone goal in a 4–1 defeat by the Boston Breakers on April 9. Her second goal on the season was an equalizer during the 70th minute of a 2–2 draw against the Western New York Flash. The Beat finished their first season in last place with a 1–4–13 record.|$|E

Jon Dolgen <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a great working {{relationship}} for years. Since I've always worked outside the studio system, I am very happy to begin my post-Carolco career with a studio as flexible, dynamic and creative as Paramount. I can't wait to make films in such an environment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} UFC 133 pre-fight press conference, Dana White {{commented on the}} {{potential}} to bring Henderson back to the UFC for a third go-around. [...] "We’ll see what happens," [...] White said on Thursday in Philadelphia. [...] "‘Hendo <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> some history in dealing. We’ll {{see if we can}} figure something out and get him back in the UFC." [...] Later Henderson commented, [...] "I think the biggest fight they could promote is probably a title unification with whoever is the champ in the UFC." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Pope Boniface VIII {{destroyed}} Palestrina in 1299, {{he ordered}} {{that it be}} plowed [...] "following the old example of Carthage in Africa", and also salted. [...] "I have run the plough over it, like the ancient Carthage of Africa, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> salt sown upon it...." [...] The text is not clear {{as to whether he}} thought Carthage was salted. Later accounts of other saltings in the destructions of medieval Italian cities are now rejected as unhistorical: Padua by Attila (452), perhaps in a parallel between Attila and the ancient Assyrians; Milan by Frederick Barbarossa (1162); and Semifonte by the Florentines (1202).|$|E
2500|$|On March 29, 2006 Sampson {{was named}} the head coach at Indiana University {{following}} the resignation of Mike Davis. Sampson was the second minority coach {{in the history of}} the Hoosier basketball program behind Mike Davis. Upon taking the reins of the Indiana Hoosiers he noted, [...] "I love my job at Oklahoma and I would not leave OU for any job unless it was a job like Indiana. My family <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> 12 great years at Oklahoma, the best years of our life, but Indiana is one of the great programs in college basketball and if they call and offer, it is a job as a coach that you have to take." ...|$|E
60|$|Thursday {{morning was}} an ideal Thanksgiving morning--bright, crisp and sparkling.

2500|$|Hamilton praised {{his team}} {{for all their}} work during the season, stating that [...] "we pushed very hard {{throughout}} the year, so a big thank to all the guys back home at the factory for not giving up. Next year {{will be a better}} year." [...] Button echoed Hamilton's comments about the work of his McLaren team, and summed up his first season with the team: [...] "I would like to say a big thank you to the team. This is my first year with the team <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a great season. I really feel at home and I think the experiences we have gained this year, Lewis and myself, with working closely with the engineers and everyone in the Vodafone McLaren Mercedes team means we can really build on this season for next year." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1977, both Molland and Evans {{were out}} of the music business. Molland later {{described}} his dire economic circumstances: [...] "Thank God I had guitars and I was able to sell some of that stuff. We were flat broke, and that's happened to me three times, where my wife <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to sell off everything and go and stay with her parents or do whatever. I installed carpeting for a while in Los Angeles and stuff like that. You do what you've got to do to survive." [...] In London, Evans briefly had jobs insulating pipes, and driving a taxi. Collins was having trouble paying the lease on the group's two-room rehearsal studio at No. 6 Denmark Street, London. After advertising for new occupants, he was contacted by Malcolm McLaren, manager of the Sex Pistols, who gave Collins £650 (...) and a Fender Rhodes piano as down payment.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the now {{strained}} relationship between Lucky and Luke, Jackson stated: “Tony [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> some great scenes that feel like re-establishing something. Again, I did not watch the other versions of Lucky, but for me it's picking up where I left off ten years ago, but now as an adult. There {{is a lot of}} interesting chemistry going on there.” The history between Jackson and Geary helped the on-screen relationship become more dynamic. Jackson's return also saw the relationship between Lucky and Jason change. Although Lucky does not abandon the police force, the previously black-and-white cop works hand-in-hand with the mob enforcer in attempts to take down both [...] "The Balkan" [...] (Benzali) and Franco (James Franco). Lucky becomes stuck between {{the two sides of the}} law. Jackson explained to The Huffington Post in 2009: [...] "I think my instincts towards him being a detective (include) ambiguity. Growing up as Luke's son, and given Luke's ties to the mob, Lucky's seen the world from both sides. I don't think that Lucky sees it as black and white. There are shades of gray." [...] In 2010, when asked if Lucky would become more “Luke-like” now that he was back in the role, Jackson replied: “I am hoping that is where they go with it. Lucky has been doing a lot of that straight cop stuff. I think if we can show the wild side of him that resembles Luke that will be nice.” He commented in a 2011 interview with Entertainment Weekly that he would like Lucky and Luke to work a con again, stating: [...] "Lucky feels the most free and like himself when he's doing stuff like that. They've had Luke and Lucky pitted against each other for a while, so it'd be nice to pair them up." ...|$|E
