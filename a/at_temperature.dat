5|$|Protactinium(V) {{chloride}} {{is prepared}} by reacting protactinium oxide with carbon tetrachloride <b>at</b> <b>temperature</b> of 200–300°C. The by-products (such as PaOCl3) are removed by fractional sublimation. Reduction of protactinium(V) chloride with hydrogen at about 800°C yields protactinium(IV) chloride – a yellow-green solid which sublimes in vacuum at 400°C; {{it can also}} be obtained directly from protactinium dioxide by treating it with carbon tetrachloride at 400°C.|$|E
5|$|This {{exothermic}} reaction is very slow below 100°C, but <b>at</b> <b>temperature</b> above 900°C {{the reaction is}} rapid. Most metals undergo similar reactions. The redox reaction is relevant to the instability of fuel assemblies at high temperatures. This reaction was responsible for a small hydrogen explosion first observed inside the reactor building of Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in 1979, but at that time, the containment building was not damaged. The same reaction occurred in the reactors 1, 2 and 3 of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant (Japan) after the reactor cooling was interrupted by the earthquake and tsunami disaster of March 11, 2011 leading to the Fukushima I nuclear accidents. After venting the hydrogen in the maintenance hall of those three reactors, the mixture of hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen exploded, severely damaging the installations {{and at least one}} of the containment buildings. To avoid explosion, the direct venting of hydrogen to the open atmosphere would have been a preferred design option. Now, to prevent the risk of explosion in many pressurized water reactor (PWR) containment buildings, a catalyst-based recombinator is installed that converts hydrogen and oxygen into water at room temperature before the hazard arises.|$|E
