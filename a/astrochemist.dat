50|$|Molecular astrophysics, {{developed}} into a rigorous field of investigation by theoretical <b>astrochemist</b> Alexander Dalgarno beginning in 1967, concerns the study of emission from molecules in space. There are 110 currently known interstellar molecules. These molecules have large numbers of observable transitions. Lines may also be observed in absorption—for example the highly redshifted lines seen against the gravitationally lensed quasar PKS1830-211. High energy radiation, such as ultraviolet light, can break the molecular bonds which hold atoms in molecules. In general then, molecules are found in cool astrophysical environments. The most massive objects in our galaxy are giant clouds of molecules and dust known as giant molecular clouds. In these clouds, and smaller versions of them, stars and planets are formed. One of the primary fields of study of molecular astrophysics is star and planet formation. Molecules {{may be found in}} many environments, however, from stellar atmospheres to those of planetary satellites. Most of these locations are relatively cool, and molecular emission is most easily studied via photons emitted when the molecules make transitions between low rotational energy states. One molecule, composed of the abundant carbon and oxygen atoms, and very stable against dissociation into atoms, is carbon monoxide (CO). The wavelength of the photon emitted when the CO molecule falls from its lowest excited state to its zero energy, or ground, state is 2.6mm, or 115 gigahertz. This frequency is a thousand times higher than typical FM radio frequencies. At these high frequencies, molecules in the Earth's atmosphere can block transmissions from space, and telescopes must be located in dry (water is an important atmospheric blocker), high sites. Radio telescopes must have very accurate surfaces to produce high fidelity images.|$|E
50|$|One {{particularly}} important experimental tool in astrochemistry is spectroscopy, {{the use of}} telescopes to measure the absorption and emission of light from molecules and atoms in various environments. By comparing astronomical observations with laboratory measurements, <b>astrochemists</b> can infer the elemental abundances, chemical composition, and temperatures of stars and interstellar clouds. This is possible because ions, atoms, and molecules have characteristic spectra: that is, the absorption and emission of certain wavelengths (colors) of light, often not visible to the human eye. However, these measurements have limitations, with various types of radiation (radio, infrared, visible, ultraviolet etc.) able to detect only certain types of species, depending on the chemical properties of the molecules. Interstellar formaldehyde was the first organic molecule detected in the interstellar medium.|$|R
40|$|American Astronomical Society, AAS Meeting # 214, # 402. 15 International audienceMore than 140 {{molecular}} {{species have been}} observed in the interstellar medium since 1937 containing up to 13 atoms. In many cases, chemical models fail to reproduce observations. In cold dark clouds for instance, gas-phase methanol is observed while chemical models, even including gas-grain interactions, underestimated its abundance by several orders of magnitude. Although some of these discrepancies are {{probably due to the}} fact that these models do not take into account the history of the material or some important physical processes, many improvements can be done from the chemical point of view. Indeed, chemical models use networks in which only a small fraction of the reactions have been studied in interstellar medium conditions. Before making models more complicated, one has to get the chemistry right. For this reason, <b>astrochemists</b> really rely on experimental measurements and theoretical calculations of rate coefficients. Similarly, chemists interested in this field of research need <b>astrochemists</b> to guide them to the priority reactions to be studied. KIDA (for KInetic Database for Astrochemistry) was built with the aim of improving the exchange between these two communities: the astrophysicists and the chemists/physicists who determine the reaction rate coefficients. KIDA is a database, which will contain all the kinetic data that can be of interest for the chemical modeling of the interstellar medium and planetary atmospheres. In addition of containing information about the data (references, detailed on the methods to obtain the data, range of temperature etc), the interface with the database allows physicists and chemists to upload themselves their data.

40|$|Abstract. The {{formation}} of CO 2 in quiescent molecular cores {{has long been}} of interest to <b>astrochemists</b> as CO 2 {{is one of the}} most abundant solid phase molecules present in the interstellar medium. Previous studies have concentrated, for the most part, on formation mechanisms involving high energy particle or UV bombardment of ices, to mimic the influence of cosmic rays on solid phase species in the outer, lower density regions of molecular clouds. However, condensed phase CO 2 is also observed in the inner, denser regions of clouds, where less UV radiation penetrates. To date, very few studies have been made of CO 2 formation in the absence of energetic particles. Low-energy routes to the {{formation of}} CO 2 are crucial to explain the high abundances of this molecule observed in quiescent regions. We discuss recent experimental results of a study of the low-energy reaction CO + OH. A simple model, developed to describe the kinetics of the system, suggests that the various reactions of the OH radical are key in characterising the production of CO 2 and other species. Our results indicate that some CO 2 forms concurrently with H 2 O in molecular clouds, in line with both previous observations and theory. The results of this research are published in Noble et al. (2011). ...|$|R
40|$|In cold astrophysical environments, some {{molecules}} {{are observed}} in the gas phase whereas {{they should have been}} depleted, frozen on dust grains. In order to solve this problem, <b>astrochemists</b> have proposed that a fraction of molecules synthesized on the surface of dust grains could desorb just after their formation. Recently the chemical desorption process has been demonstrated experimentally, but the key parameters at play have not yet been fully understood. In this article we propose a new procedure to analyze the ratio of di-oxygen and ozone synthesized after O atoms adsorption on oxidized graphite. We demonstrate that the chemical desorption efficiency of the two reaction paths (O+O and O+O_ 2) is different by one order of magnitude. We show the importance of the surface coverage: for the O+O reaction, the chemical desorption efficiency is close to 80 % at zero coverage and tends to zero at one monolayer coverage. The coverage dependence of O+O chemical desorption is proved by varying the amount of pre-adsorbed N_ 2 on the substrate from 0 to 1. 5 ML. Finally, we discuss the relevance of the different physical parameters that could {{play a role in the}} chemical desorption process: binding energy, enthalpy of formation, and energy transfer from the new molecule to the surface or to other adsorbates.

40|$|Heating {{of whole}} {{interstellar}} dust grains by cosmic-ray (CR) particles affects the gas-grain chemistry in molecular clouds by promoting molecule desorption, diffusion, and chemical reactions on grain surfaces. The frequency of such heating f_T, s^- 1, determines how often a certain temperature T_ CR, K, is reached for grains hit by CR particles. This study aims to provide <b>astrochemists</b> with comprehensive and updated dataset on the CR-induced whole-grain heating. We present calculations of f_T and T_ CR spectra for bare olivine grains with radius a of 0. 05; 0. 1; 0. 2 μm, and such grains covered with ice mantles of thickness 0. 1 a and 0. 3 a. Grain shape and structure effects are considered, {{as well as}} 30 CR elemental constituents with an updated energy spectrum corresponding to a translucent cloud with A_V= 2 mag. Energy deposition by CRs in grain material was calculated with the SRIM program. We report full T_ CR spectra for all nine grain types and consider initial grain temperatures of 10 K and 20 K. We also provide frequencies {{for a range of}} minimum T_ CR values. The calculated dataset can be simply and flexibly implemented in astrochemical models. The results show that, in the case of translucent clouds, the currently adopted rate for heating of whole grains to temperatures in excess of 70 K is underestimated by approximately two orders of magnitude in astrochemical numerical simulations. Additionally, grains are heated by CRs to modest temperatures (20 [...] 30 K) with intervals of a few years, which reduces the possibility of ice chemical explosions.

40|$|International audienceThe {{discovery}} of carbocations and carbanions by Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) and the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) instruments onboard the Cassini spacecraft in Titan׳s upper atmosphere is truly amazing for <b>astrochemists</b> and astrobiologists. In this paper we identify the reaction mechanisms {{for the growth}} of the complex macromolecules observed by the CAPS Ion Beam Spectrometer (IBS) and Electron Spectrometer (ELS). This identification is based on a recently published paper (Ali et al., 2013. Planet. Space Sci. 87, 96) which emphasizes the role of Olah׳s nonclassical carbonium ion chemistry in the synthesis of the organic molecules observed in Titan׳s thermosphere and ionosphere by INMS. The main conclusion of that work was the demonstration of the presence of the cyclopropenyl cation – the simplest Huckel׳s aromatic molecule – and its cyclic methyl derivatives in Titan׳s atmosphere at high altitudes. In this study, we present the transition from simple aromatic molecules to the complex ortho-bridged bi- and tri-cyclic hydrocarbons, e. g., CH 2 + mono-substituted naphthalene and phenanthrene, as well as the ortho- and peri-bridged tri-cyclic aromatic ring, e. g., perinaphthenyl cation. These rings could further grow into tetra-cyclic and the higher order ring polymers in Titan׳s upper atmosphere. Contrary to the pre-Cassini observations, the nitrogen chemistry of Titan׳s upper atmosphere is found to be extremely rich. A variety of N-containing hydrocarbons including the N-heterocycles where a CH group in the polycyclic rings mentioned above is replaced by an N atom, e. g., CH 2 + substituted derivative of quinoline (benzopyridine), are found to be dominant in Titan׳s upper atmosphere. The mechanisms for the formation of complex molecular anions are discussed as well. It is proposed that many closed-shell complex carbocations after their formation first, in Titan׳s upper atmosphere, undergo the kinetics of electron recombination to form open-shell neutral radicals. These radical species subsequently might form carbanions via radiative electron attachment at low temperatures with thermal electrons. The classic example is the perinaphthenyl anion in Titan׳s upper atmosphere. Therefore, future astronomical observations of selected carbocations and corresponding carbanions are required to settle the key issue of molecular anion chemistry on Titan. Other than earth, Titan is the only planetary body in our solar system that is known to have reservoirs of permanent liquids on its surface. The synthesis of complex biomolecules either by organic catalysis of precipitated solutes “on hydrocarbon solvent” on Titan or through the solvation process indeed started in its upper atmosphere. The most notable examples in Titan׳s prebiotic atmospheric chemistry are conjugated and aromatic polycyclic molecules, N-heterocycles including the presence of imino >CN–H functional group in the carbonium chemistry. Our major conclusion in this paper is that the synthesis of organic compounds in Titan׳s upper atmosphere is a direct consequence of the chemistry of carbocations involving the ion–molecule reactions. The observations of complexity in the organic chemistry on Titan from the Cassini–Huygens mission clearly indicate that Titan is so far the only planetary object in our solar system that will most likely provide an {{answer to the question of}} the synthesis of complex biomolecules on the primitive earth and the origin of lif...|$|R
