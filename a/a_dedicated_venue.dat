40|$|Over {{the last}} 15 years, {{political}} science has witnessed a renaissance in qualitative research methods (see, e. g., Brady and Collier, eds., 2010). The canon has been reworked, new areas of scholarship have appeared, and a rapidly expanding body {{of political science}} research now employs qualitative and multimethod analysis. Correspondingly, as noted in this symposium's introductory essay on openness dialogue, although qualitative researchers have begun to explore ways to share their data and access those of other scholars, the lack of <b>a</b> <b>dedicated</b> <b>venue</b> or consensual set of practices for storing, sharing, and reusing qualitative social science data in the United States (Heaton 2004 : 6) presents a significant obstacle. This infrastructure gap-which transcends scholarly differences over the contributions of qualitative research-contrasts sharply with well-established norm in quantitative research, and with the practices of qualitative social scientist in other countries. As {{a result of the}} lack of an appropriate data-sharing venue, the few American social scientists who do share their qualitative data generally do so via inefficient ad hoc arrangements...|$|E

40|$|Workshop {{proceedings}} Preface While content-based recommendation {{has been}} applied successfully in many different domains, it has not seen {{the same level of}} attention as collaborative filtering techniques have. In recent years, competitions like the Netflix Prize, CAMRA, and the Yahoo! Music KDD Cup 2011 have spurred on advances in collaborative filtering and how to utilize ratings and usage data. However, there are many domains where content and metadata play a key role, either in addition to or instead of ratings and implicit usage data. For some domains, such as movies the relationship between content and usage data has seen thorough investigation already, but for many other domains, such as books, news, scientific articles, and Web pages we do not know if and how these data sources should be combined to provided the best recommendation performance. The CBRecSys 2014 workshop aims to address this by providing <b>a</b> <b>dedicated</b> <b>venue</b> for papers dedicated to all aspects of content-based recommendation. We issued a Call for Papers asking for submissions of novel research papers (both long and short) addressing recommendation in do-mains where textual content is abundant (e. g., books, news, scientific articles, jobs, educationa...|$|E
40|$|The {{theory of}} tree automata {{has always had}} a close {{connection}} with natural language processing. In the 1960 s, computational linguistics was the major driving force {{for the development of a}} theory of tree automata. However, the number of successful applications of this theory to natural language processing remained small during the 20 th century. This situation has now changed. Applications of tree automata in natural language processing can be found in work on topics as diverse as grammar formalisms, computational semantics, language generation, and machine translation. Researchers in natural language processing have recognized the usefulness of tree automata theory for solving the problems they are interested in, and theorists are inspired by the resulting theoretical questions. The goals of this workshop are to provide <b>a</b> <b>dedicated</b> <b>venue</b> for the presentation of work that relates the theory of tree automata to natural language processing, and to create a forum where researchers from the two areas can meet and exchange ideas. Specifically, the workshop aims at raising the awareness for theoretical results useful for applications in natural language processing, and at identifying open theoretical problems raised by such applications. We are very happy that Kevin Knight (ISI/University of Southern California, USA), certainly the most recognized ambassador for tree automata techniques in machine translation, agreed to give one of hi...|$|E

40|$|Presentation Type: Forum Title: Disseminating Occupational Science: An SSO:USA Journal? Key Words: publishing, journal, {{disciplinary}} discourse Aims/Intent: The aim of {{the forum}} is to raise questions {{in a way that}} will develop a vision for future occupational science dissemination by the Society, generate discussion about the intent and needs of the science and its scientists, and stimulate discourse about broader questions of the intent and future of the science. Rationale: Publishing opportunities in occupational science are perceived to be limited. Although the discipline has greatly benefitted from its single journal for over twenty years, that journal’s editorial policy does not allow it to be inclusive of all occupational science work (Taylor 2 ̆ 6 Francis). The lack of <b>a</b> <b>dedicated</b> <b>venue</b> that includes research on occupation in practice obscures and hampers fulfillment of the originating intent of the science to contribute to the knowledge base of occupational therapy (Clark et al., 1991; Pierce, 2012). Further, the absence of a journal embracing all types of occupational science prevents a vigorous exploration of the relations between different types of occupational science research and the productive tensions among extra-disciplinary, interdisciplinary, disciplinary, professional, and inter-professional research on occupation. Publications spread across a variety of extra-disciplinary, interdisciplinary, and professional journals are less likely to produce the syntheses required to speed development of the science. This important gap in occupational science dissemination will be examined in this forum. The SSO:USA Editors Study concluded that (a) all editors agreed a new and fully inclusive journal was needed, (b) there were opportunities for special issues or recurring features in existing journals, and (c) multiple pragmatic and editorial challenges would accompany the launch of a new journal (Pierce, 2010). Since that study, the Society has continued to develop its capacity for publications through the successful establishment of annual meeting proceedings (SSO:USA). Now, the Society requires a more tangible vision of its future dissemination efforts. The specifics of a potential journal’s mission, targeted contributors and audience, format, and financing all need to be drafted before decisions can be made by the Board. Participants in this forum will contribute to this vision. Participant Outcomes: Enhanced perspectives on publishing venues and gaps for occupational science researchers. Insights into the pragmatics of journal publishing. Influence on the mission and format of a future occupational science journal Discussion Questions to Facilitate Occupational Science Concepts and Ideas: What are the publishing patterns and needs of occupational scientists? Should the intermediary step of facilitating special issues or recurring features in existing journals be undertaken prior to the launch of a new journal? If the mission of the journal is inclusive of all types of occupational science research, will it be attractive to all occupational scientists, or only to a subgroup? To what degree should the journal’s mission and format reach out to interdisciplinary or occupational therapy audiences, or both, through special features? Is an online format best? Should the journal be based on annual subscriptions, provided as a member benefit, open-sourced and available to all, or open-sourced and financed through author payments to publish...|$|E
