5|$|The Europeans (French, Dutch and English) in the Northeast {{developed}} a fur trade with natives, including the Five Nations of the Iroquois; beaver furs were most desired. However, in the 17th century, {{the dominance of}} what historian Daniel Richter refers to as “Francophiles” or French takeover, contributed to an erosion of French-native relations. The French mission to assimilate natives required the abandonment of native tradition, which was met with resistance. By 1667, large numbers of Huron and Iroquois, especially Mohawk, started arriving at the St Lawrence Valley and its mission villages, to escape the effects of warfare. Many traditionalists, including some Mohawk, resented the Jesuits for destroying traditional native society but were unable to do <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> them. However, traditionalists reluctantly accepted {{the establishment of a}} mission in order to have good relations with the French, whom they needed for trade. This cultural invasion increased tensions between the two factions.|$|E
5|$|Rain and fog {{were heavy}} {{throughout}} {{the morning of}} July 6, and visibility was limited for the emplaced troops. Just after daybreak, 13 North Korean T-34 tanks were spotted stopped at the bridge. Following them were two columns of infantry. The American forces originally believed {{that they might be}} survivors of Task Force Smith until they realized the forces were deploying in numbers too great, and began preparing to attack the unsuspecting North Koreans. The battalion's commander ordered mortar fire on the North Korean forces, causing them to disperse as the lead tank began firing on the positions of A Company, on a hill southwest of the road. Mortar fire destroyed a truck, but a round from a North Korean tank stunned the artillery observer and no one took his place in the confusion, ending the American mortar attack. North Korean forces immediately began advancing on A Company's position, but the company was not able to return fire effectively, with fewer than half of its soldiers using their weapons. For several minutes only squad and platoon leaders shot back {{while the rest of the}} soldiers hid in their foxholes. Within fifteen minutes, B Company was able to return fire effectively, and by this time the North Korean forces had advanced steadily toward 1st Battalion's position. Later examinations found many American soldiers' weapons were assembled incorrectly or were dirty or broken. The Americans had nothing with which to fight the tanks, and were unable to do <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> them.|$|E

Her husband continued to beat her {{and threatened to}} kill her if she attempted to contact her parents, close friends who lived nearby, or the police. Genie's father also forced his son into silence, giving him {{instructions on how to}} keep his father's actions secret and beating him with increasing frequency and severity, and as he got older his father forced him to carry out progressively more of his abuse of Genie in the same manner. He felt completely powerless to do <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> it and feared severe retribution for attempting to intervene, and on multiple occasions tried to run away from the house. Genie's father was convinced Genie would die by age 12 and promised that, if she survived past that age, he would allow his wife to seek outside assistance for her, but he reneged when Genie turned 12 and her mother took no action for another year and a half.|$|E
25|$|The British {{troops were}} horrified and enraged.

Brigadier General Neill, who took the command at Cawnpore, immediately began a program of swift and vicious drumhead military justice (culminating in summary execution) for any sepoy rebel captured from the city who was unable to prove he was not involved in the massacre. Rebels confessing to or believed {{to be involved in the}} massacre were forced to lick the floor of the Bibighar compound, after it had been wetted with water by low caste people, while being whipped. The sepoys were then religiously disgraced by being forced to eat (or force fed) beef (if Hindu) or pork (if Muslim). The Muslim sepoys were sewn into pig skins before being hanged, and low-caste Hindu street sweepers were employed to execute the high-caste Brahmin rebels to add additional religious disgrace to their punishment.|$|E

500|$|There were officially ten {{suspects}} for the murder, {{though the}} ten were {{not known to}} viewers or cast members, who speculated about {{the identity of the}} killer. On Christmas Eve, storylines showed Archie evicting his wife Peggy, daughters Ronnie and Roxy, Peggy's son Phil and Phil's son Ben (Charlie Jones) from their home, The Queen Victoria public house, after he became the landlord. Ronnie had a further motive as Archie had caused her to suffer a miscarriage and she blamed him for the death of her daughter Danielle Jones (Lauren Crace) earlier in 2009. Peggy discovered that Archie had paid her daughter Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook) to skip bail, thus plunging the Mitchells into debt, and Sam returned on Christmas Day to discover she had been manipulated. Phil was also a suspect after failing to kill Archie on Peggy's request earlier in 2009. Simons explained that the killer was likely to be the most unsuspecting person, and stated that Roxy was [...] "pretty much the only non-suspect," [...] but said she felt the character would not {{go so far as to}} kill her father, even though she had seen his true colours. Woodyatt said his character, Ian Beale, would have done <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> his wife Jane (Laurie Brett) from finding out that he had sex with Janine, so it would be plausible if it turned out that Ian had killed Archie. Archie had a laptop recording of Ian and Janine together that he had threatened to give to Jane. Janine, who was engaged to Archie, also had a motive as Archie had been using her to gain ownership of The Queen Victoria and threw her out on Christmas Day. She was seen holding a knife before Archie was killed.|$|E

[...] Those same vessels had been defied by two Paraguayan chatas (flat-bottomed, towable barges mounting a single gun). [...] Although the Brazilian naval command protested that the shallow river waters enjoined caution, the Brazilian soldiery and the Emperor Pedro II were disgusted.

2500|$|Shinn is {{introduced}} in the series {{as a member of}} the military organization ZAFT from the colony PLANT, working as the pilot of the mobile suit [...] under the command of Talia Gladys, captain of the battleship Minerva. While Shinn is often seen as a friendly person, he bears an enormous hatred towards the rulers of the country of Orb, where he lived alongside his parents and his younger sister. Shinn's family was killed in a crossfire between mobile suits from the Earth Alliance and Orb during the Bloody Valentine war. When Athrun Zala becomes Shinn's commander, he is initially angered by his appointment, but eventually comes to respect him. Upon the start of a new war between ZAFT and the Earth Alliance, Shinn saves a girl named Stella Loussier from drowning. The two befriend each other, without realizing that they were actually fighting each other in the war. Shinn discovers she is an Earth Alliance's soldier only after he defeats her mobile suit in a battle. Because of Stella being an Extended, a person injected with drugs from a young age to fight at the same level of the Coordinators, the Minerva staff can not do <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> her health from deteriorating. Shinn takes the dying Stella to her superior Neo Roanoke knowing he is the only one who can save her. However, Shinn once again battles Stella who is attacking Berlin in an enormous transformable mobile suit. Stella had gone berserk due to her fear of dying and her mobile suit is then destroyed by Kira Yamato, a pilot from the Archangel ship that is trying to stop the war. Stella dies in Shinn's arms due to the injuries received from her suit's destruction.|$|E

In Alpert’s surrender statement she mentioned work in the feminist movement as a major goal.

2500|$|The Indian innings started modestly, {{with only}} a total of two {{boundaries}} coming off the blades of the two openers, Sehwag and Chopra, but then in the eighth over, with the scorecard reading 30 for no loss, they cracked two fours off a Gillespie over and took 11 runs off it. In the ninth over, they handed out the same treatment to Bichel as well, carting him for 13 runs to bring a fifty-run partnership from just 9.4 overs. India's first 10 overs yielded 54 runs. But in the fifth and last ball of the eleventh over, Bichel, who was a controversial selection after a poor game in Brisbane, bowled to a straight, canny field by Waugh, and ended Chopra's 27-run stay with an innocuous half-volley, which Chopra drove uppishly towards the bowler. Bichel showed wonderful athleticism in holding on to a low return catch, breaking the 66-run partnership. Later, in the 15th over, by which time Sehwag had already bludgeoned 47 from 41 balls, Bichel [...] "outfoxed" [...] Sehwag with a legcutter which bounced more than expected, resulting in a fatal edge from Sehwag, which was held onto by Hayden (81/2). Sachin Tendulkar, yet to score a run in the series after his ill-fated duck at the Gabba, was distinctly ill at-ease, and was almost run out by Langer. He made a solitary run before getting out to Bichel, whose third wicket reduced the Indians to 83/3. Sourav Ganguly, man of the match in the previous test was the next batsman, but he could hardly do <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the run-glut. He scratched his way to 2, before he was run out, leaving the Indian team reeling at 85/4. VVS Laxman the next man walked in.|$|E
