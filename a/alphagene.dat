5000|$|<b>Alphagene</b> (German for [...] "Alphagenes") is {{the debut}} album by German rapper Kollegah. It was {{released}} on November 16, 2007 on Selfmade Records and was produced by hip hop producer Rizbo. That album brought Kollegah {{the first time in}} the German Albums Chart.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} 2005, Dammann {{left the}} music label and Omerbegovic took over single-handedly. Due to its infrastructural advantages, he {{relocated}} the Selfmade Records headquarters to Düsseldorf in 2007. In addition to his work as label manager, Omerbegovic also took over the positions of product and tour manager. In addition, he helped with {{the production of the}} releases, [...] "subtly influencing the albums" [...] by suggesting the modification of sounds, lyrics or selected verses. In 2007, <b>Alphagene</b> by Kollegah was the label's first album to enter the German charts. In the following two years, the label achieved similar successes with Favorite and Shiml. In 2009, another Rapper by the name of Casper was signed. Selfmade Records presented Casper as part of the sampler Chronik 2. In the following months, the contractual collaboration with Shiml and Casper was terminated. At the end of 2011 and at the beginning of 2012, the Hip Hop groups Genetikk and 257ers were presented as new additions to the label, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a review}} by Max Brandl for the E-Zine Laut.de was Jung, brutal, gutaussehend {{two out of}} five {{possible}} evaluation points and was considered so much worse than Kollegah's previous solo albums <b>Alphagene</b> and Kollegah. Compared to these are his contributions to the album [...] "nearly disastrous". The instrumentals were all being judged negatively, except for the beats to Schwarzgeld, Mitternacht and Der Härteste im Land. Overall, the cooperation of Farid Bang and Kollegah did not work quite well: [...] "Not that both would steal the show from each other - unfortunately no. Both forfeit their particular strengths." [...] Furthermore, Brandl criticized Kollegah's arrogant talk would abate bored fatigue. As a result of dissing many German rappers such as Samy Deluxe, Farid Bang would irritate and seem embarrassing. Despite all the negative criticism, Kollegah would show in songs like Banger und Boss or Die Härtesten im Land that he {{remains one of the}} best rappers in Germany and that publishing a solo album in 2010 would more reasonable for both Farid Bang and Kollegah.|$|E
