50|$|Another {{aspect of}} the Arca-Swiss system is that the {{mounting}} plates are designed to prevent accidental rotation of the plate relative to the device. When used with a camera or camera body the plates incorporate an <b>anti-rotation</b> flange or lip. When mounted to a lens with a foot, the plate will often be secured with two screws to prevent rotation. When this type of system is used, the camera cannot become accidentally detached from the tripod, which is possible when using a quick-release system that doesn't prevent rotation, or when no camera mount is used. Nearly all makes and models of modern SLRs, medium format cameras, and large lenses have specific plates available with <b>anti-rotation</b> flanges. There are plates available for certain models of other formats of cameras, such as point and shoots, as well. Universal mounting plates are also available, {{which can be used}} with nearly any camera with a tripod mount, though they provide little or no <b>anti-rotation</b> protection.|$|E
50|$|The {{swashplate}} {{consists of}} two main parts: a stationary swashplate and a rotating swashplate. The stationary (outer) swashplate is mounted on the main rotor mast and {{is connected to the}} cyclic and collective controls by a series of pushrods. It is able to tilt in all directions and move vertically. The rotating (inner) swashplate is mounted to the stationary swashplate by means of a bearing and is allowed to rotate with the main rotor mast. An <b>anti-rotation</b> link prevents the inner swash from rotating independently of the blades, which would apply torque to the actuators. The outer swashplate typically has an <b>anti-rotation</b> slider as well to prevent it from rotating. Both swashplates tilt up and down as one unit. The rotating swashplate is connected to the pitch horns by the pitch links. Alternative mechanics to the stationary (outer) swashplate are the hexapod and the universal joint.Swashplates for helicopters having two rotors mounted on the same shaft are much more complex than the single rotor helicopters.|$|E

40|$|The sliding {{compression}} device, {{a widely}} used implant in unstable proximal femoral fractures, suffers from two major limitations: excessive collapse and screw cut-out. Commonly attributed reasons for these are lateral wall comminution and single-point fixation, respectively. We report {{our experience of}} stabilising 74 unstable trochanteric fractures, of which 46 cases underwent lateral wall reconstruction using a trochanteric stabilising plate (TSP) in combination with a dynamic hip screw (DHS), and 34 cases with an intact lateral wall had a DHS with an additional <b>anti-rotation</b> screw providing two-point fixation.

The temperature-resolved experiments were performed using a translating imaging plate system.

Bikitaite is stable at least up to 800 degreesC, the temperature at which the phase transition to gamma-spodumene begins. The dehydration process begins at about 200 degreesC, affecting the two water sites in a similar way, and is complete at 468 degreesC.

Backdrivability, mechanical simplicity and efficient flexure joint structures are key concepts that have guided the mechanical design rationale to provide the actuator with force sensing capabilities. Indeed, a self-sensing characteristic is achieved by the specific design of high-resolution cable-driven actuators based on a DC motor, a ball-screw and a monolithic compliant <b>anti-rotation</b> system together with a novel flexure pivot providing a frictionless mechanical structure.

Simultaneously, it helps to remove friction at the joint level of the mechanism. Experimental tests carried out on a prototype show an accurate matching between the model and the real behavior. Overall, this mechatronic design contributes to the improvement of the manipulation skills of robotic grippers, thanks to the combination of high performance mechanics, high sensitivity to external forces and compliance control capability...|$|E

Biomechanical properties of the new nail met ASTM F 384 guideline requirements. The cadaver study yielded equivalent results for the pullout test between the peg and the hip screw, but found the peg superior in the torsion strength test. IOP during peg insertion and expansion was substantially lower than the threshold pressure that causes avascular necrosis.

However, significant complications still occur and most fractures heal with significant collapse, resulting in limb shortening and limping gait. The fixation over the femoral head region is still not satisfactory and lag screw cut-out occurs 6 - 19 %. The helical blade plate fixation was devised {{as an attempt to}} improve the fixation of the femoral head. The theoretical advantage includes an increased cross section area to resist cut-out and a decreased amount of bone removed from the femoral head during insertion. An <b>anti-rotation</b> mechanism was also devised, which potentially decreased the amount of rotational displacement during fracture collapse. A total of 104 dynamic helical blade plate fixations were performed in Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong. The average age was 82. The indications include AO/OTA 31 A 1 and A 2 fractures. Cut-out of the helical blade occurred in two patients (1. 9 %). All other fractures united with different degrees of shortening. The theoretical advantages of the helical blade fixation of the osteoporotic femoral head appear to be valid.

Objectives: This study aimed to investigate similarities and differences in the micromorphology of implant-abutment connections between original and different third party components and consequently extrapolate to clinical implications. Materials and methods: Straumann implants were connected with original gold abutments and 5 compatible third party components. All units were then sliced and placed under different magnifications (10 x - 500 x) through a SEM and digitally photographed. Measurements of tight contact surface were conducted with calibrated Photographic editing software (ImageJ, USA) with precision of 1 μm.

The obtained annual parallax corresponds to the trigonometric distance of 2. 42 (- 0. 09) (+ 0. 11) kpc. Assuming a Galactocentric distance of the Sun of 8. 5 kpc, the circular rotational velocity of the local standard of rest {{at a distance of}} the Sun of 220 km s(- 1), and a flat Galactic rotation curve, S Persei is suggested to have a non-circular motion deviating from the Galactic circular rotation for 15 km s(- 1), which is mainly dominated by the <b>anti-rotation</b> direction component of 12. 9 +/- 2. 9 km s(- 1).

In contrast, its vertical α-abundance profile is almost flat, with a gradient of d[α/M]/dz = 0. 008 ± 0. 002 dex kpc^- 1. The steep metallicity gradient of the low-α population seems consistent with various radial migration predictions and further confirms that migration {{plays an important role in}} the evolution of the thin disk.

The {{aim of this study}} is to compare the clinical effectiveness of the percutaneous compression plate (PCCP) versus proximal femoral nail <b>anti-rotation</b> (PFNA) in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures in elderly patients. MethodsA prospective randomized study was carried out from January 2008 to October 2011 involving 90 elderly patients with intertrochanteric fractures (90 hips) who underwent minimally invasive surgery using the PCCP or PFNA. Evaluation variables, including operation time, intra- and perioperative blood loss, duration of hospital stay, incidence of postoperative complications, and final clinical outcomes by the end of follow-up, were used to compare the benefits of these two implants. ResultsAmong 90 subjects, 45 received PCCPs and 45 received PFNAs. The baseline characteristics of the two groups were comparable. The median follow-up time was 16. 9 months (12 – 24 months). In the PCCP group, the mean operative time was 53 min (40 – 75 min), and the mean intra- and perioperative blood losses were 100. 7 ml (60 – 150 ml) and 916 ml (433 – 1339 ml), respectively, which were significantly lower than those in the PFNA group. Nevertheless, there was no statistical difference in the incidence of postoperative complications and final clinical outcomes including pain complaints, range of motion of the hip, postoperative hip function at 12 months, and the recovery of walking ability to pre-injury status between these two implants. ConclusionsOverall, the PCCP and PFNA appear to have similar clinical effects in treating elderly patients with intertrochanteric fractures, although the PCCP provided shorter operation times and less blood loss than PFNA. Both implants discussed were demonstrated to be ideal for the treatment of femoral intertrochanteric fractures in elderly patients...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundWhich {{surgical}} {{strategy is}} the best one for intertrochanteric fractures remains a controversial issue. Dynamic hip screw (DHS) and Gamma nail were commonly used but often associated with some complications, such as fixation failure and implant-related fractures. Meanwhile, proximal femoral nail <b>anti-rotation</b> (PFNA) fixation has recently been developed for minimally invasive surgery to reduce the complications rate. To facilitate the clinical decision-making, we conducted an updated meta-analysis to discuss the optimal treatment of intertrochanteric fractures aiming to determine which implant gives the lower rates of blood loss, complications (peri-implant fracture, fixation failure, infection, thromboembolic), reoperation, and mortality, {{as well as the}} minimal duration related to surgery (fluoroscopic exposure, surgery and hospital stay). Patients and methodsSeven electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (including OVID, Springer, Google Scholar, PubMed, Cochrane library, Embase, and Web of Science). Fourteen studies with 1983 patients were included. The modified Jadad Scale was used to assess the methodological quality of these studies. Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Comparison among the three groups was based on twelve indicators, including operative time, fluoroscopy time, operative blood loss, length of hospital stays, wound infection or hematoma, pneumonia, thromboembolic complications, fixation failure, operative fracture of femur, later fracture of femur, reoperation, and mortality. Results(1) PFNA group versus DHS group: PFNA was associated with less blood loss (mean difference (MD) – 253. 86, 95 % CI – 270. 25 to 237. 47; P< 0. 00001) and lower rate of fixation failure (MD 0. 20, 95 % CI 0. 07 to 0. 59; P= 0. 004), but led to more fluoroscopy time (MD 2. 11, 95 % CI 1. 78 to 2. 43; P< 0. 00001). (2) PFNA group versus Gamma nail group: PFNA led to less blood loss (MD – 55. 30, 95 % CI – 60. 07 to – 50. 53; P< 0. 00001), shorter fluoroscopy time (MD – 0. 50, 95 % CI – 0. 55 to – 0. 45; P< 0. 00001) and length of hospital stay (MD – 0. 20, 95 % CI – 0. 27 to – 0. 13; P< 0. 00001). (3) DHS group versus Gamma nail group: DHS was associated with lower rate of operative fracture of femur (MD 0. 31, 95 % CI 0. 11 to 0. 89; P= 0. 03), later fracture of femur (MD 0. 16, 95 % CI 0. 06 to 0. 43; P= 0. 0004), and reoperation (MD 0. 49, 95 % CI 0. 27 to 0. 88; P= 0. 02), but caused more blood loss (MD 29. 49, 95 % CI 8. 27 to 50. 70; P= 0. 006). In contrast, there was no difference regarding operative time, infection hematoma, pneumonia, thromboembolic events, and mortality. DiscussionPFNA should be a priority choice for treatment of intertrochanteric fractures with minimal rate of fixation failure, less blood loss and shorter length of hospital stay. DHS has distinct advantages over Gamma nail with lower rate of plant-related complications and should be preferred device for intertrochanteric fractures. However, owing to the low quality evidence currently available, more high-quality RCTs are needed to confirm these findings. Level of evidenceLevel II...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluates the}} performance of automotive child restraint systems (CRS) that conform to international proposals for a universal restraint concept to be adopted by both restraint and vehicle manufacturers. The concept is known as Isofix (International Standards Organisation FIXing), and is intended to ensure optimum compatibility and coupling between vehicle and CRS. In order to quantify {{the benefits of the}} proposed Isofix concept it has been necessary to establish the performance limits and benefits offered by current commercially available adult belt retained CRS. A considerable body of knowledge existed on the performance and limitations of the then current CRS. However, during 1995 a significant amendment was introduced affecting ECE R 44, the compliance standards applicable to CRS in Europe to which most rnanufacturers require their products to conform (separate national standards also exist). In 1995 amendment 03 was added to ECE R 44 and became a catalyst for considerable development activity by manufacturers of child restraints, that resulted in new or revised product ranges. These new products, in particular forward facing Group 1 (9 - 15 kg) child restraints have significantly improved dynamic performance in frontal impacts, notably in modern vehicles whose seat belt anchorage positions have been optimised for restraint of adults, but are commonly less effective in restraining framed CRS. It was important therefore to re-assess existing systems as the baseline for a realistic evaluation of the proposed Isofix concepts (chapter 10). It was evident that, of the different Isofix concepts being proposed, no overall evaluation of their relative performance had, to that date, been undertaken. A programme involving the design and manufacture of not only suitable test equipment but, in a number of cases, prototype devices, was undertaken. The resulting data have formed the basis of input to the ISO Working Group 1, the body responsible for the evolution of the Isofix concept. This programme also highlighted a number of shortfalls in the proposed concepts. The major results of this test programme have been published at international level, and were used to inform the Isofix discussions. During the programme of comparative evaluation of not only the Isofix but the current belt retained devices, it became clear to the writer that in a frontal impact the orientation of the occupant with respect to the direction of travel had significance. A literature survey produced evidence of minimal research in this area. Hence it was decided by the writer to include a programme of parametric tests to investigate the significance of occupant orientation, given that commercially available CRS often include a feature to vary the recline angle of the seat. The Isofix set-up was particularly suitable for this exercise in that it eliminated many of the variables associated with belt retained devices. The results of this work have been published at intemationallevel. A review of the available accident data indicates that side impacts are potentially more life threatening than the more common frontal impacts due to the proximity of the occupant to an intruding vehicle or object. However, current European certification standards do not require the evaluation of CRS in a side impact. This is considered to be an area where improvements, particularly aided by an Isofix type attachment concept, can be made. Therefore the final area of research undertaken by the writer was to develop and propose a test to evaluate CRS in a realistic side impact scenario. This involved the simulation of not only the acceleration imparted to the target vehicle occupant but in addition the intrusion component. This work, which again has been presented at international level, contributed towards a proposal to amend the European certification standard for CRS to include a side impact evaluation. This thesis commences with a review of the accident data currently available, and looks at how the physiological and anatomical properties of the child, vehicle design, and the inherent potential for misuse and mis-installation of the current generation of CRS, impact upon child safety. This is followed by an overview of the lsofix proposal before the results of the writer's detailed testing of both current belt retained and proposed Isofix CRS concepts (chapters 10 and 11) are reported. The subsequent chapters (12 and 13) detail the results of the writer's investigation into CRS orientation in a frontal impact {{and the development of a}} representative side impact test, based on a single sled, for inclusion in the European certification procedure. The document concludes with discussion and conclusions relating to the future of CRS design and evaluation. The major findings of this research were: • contrary to initial expectations, significant CRS recline angle in a forward facing device has been proven to be undesirable; • Isofix CRS with rigid lower anchors have been shown to be beneficial, particularly in side impacts, their efficacy in a forward impact being compromised by rotation in devices that do not incorporate an <b>anti-rotation</b> device; • a side impact test has been developed which more accurately represents the input to a CRS seen in a rear vehicle incident. Such a test is not only desirable but essential to drive CRS manufacturers into improving side impact protection for occupants...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{large amount}} of non-biodegradable sulfonamide {{antibiotics}} used in hospitals, feedstocks and in fish farming cause their occurrence in the aquatic environment resulting in the dramatic emergence of antibiotic resistance in fish pathogens and in the transfer of these resistance determinants to bacteria in land animals and to human pathogens [1]. Permeable Reactive Barrier (PRB) is an innovative technology for the remediation of aquifers based on reactive materials which capture and remove or break down the contaminants, releasing uncontaminated water. Recently, a cheap and environmentally friendly material with excellent sorbent properties for sulfonamides has been proposed: an hydrophobic high-silica zeolite Y [2, 3]. At maximal solubility, {{it is able to}} almost completely (> 90 %) and quickly (t< 1 min) remove sulfonamide antibiotics from water media [2, 3]. Other advantage of zeolites as permeable barrier is their stability towards radiative and thermal treatments necessary to induce complete degradation of adsorbates and therefore to regenerate exhausted sorbents. In this work, the regeneration capacity of an hydrophobic high-silica zeolite Y after sulfamethoxazole antibiotic adsorption [3] was investigated by in situ high-temperature synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction to monitor the structural modifications induced by the regeneration treatment. This kind of information is crucial to design and optimize the regeneration treatment of zeolites with a very high potential for application in water remediation technologies. Experimental A powder sample of hydrophobic high-silica (SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ~ 200) zeolite Y (a= 24. 248 (1) and V= 14256. 7 (1), s. g. Fd- 3) loaded at room temperature in aqueous solution with sulfamethoxazole sulfonamide antibiotic (C 10 H 11 N 3 O 3 S, SMX hereafter) [3] was used for this study. The in situ high-temperature X-ray powder diffraction experiments were performed at the GILDA beamline at ESRF (Grenoble), using a fixed wavelength of 0. 653 Å. The powder sample was packed in a 0. 3 mm diameter quartz glass capillary, open at both ends, and heated in situ using a hot air stream. 45 diffraction patterns were recorded on a flat image-plate detector while heating the sample up to 575 °C (heating rate 10 °C/min) (temperature ramp) and then keeping this temperature for 120 minutes (isotherm mode). A further powder pattern was collected after cooling down the sample up to room conditions for 2 h (reverse). The evolution of the structural features was followed by full profile Rietveld refinements. An ex situ regeneration was also performed on the sample heated up to 550 °C (heating rate 10 °C/min) and kept at this temperature for 4 hours. The corresponding powder pattern was then compared to those collected in situ at the same temperature. Results and discussion 576 Figure 1 shows selected XRPD patterns collected in situ and the reverse and ex-situ patterns. It is evident that the thermal treatment necessary to regenerate the exhausted sorbent does not affect the crystallinity of zeolite Y. Figure. 1. Selected XRPD patterns collected in situ (in black). The reverse and ex situ powder patterns are also reported (grey lines). Figure 2. Normalized unit-cell parameters as a function of time (minutes) /temperature (°C). Figure 3. Number of SMX molecules/u. c. as a function of time (minutes) /temperature (°C). The evolution of the unit-cell parameters upon heating are shown in Figure 2. Between 25 - 200 °C, the unit-cell parameters slightly increase with increasing T. In this temperature range, the relaxation of the H-bonding interactions between SMX and the framework oxygen atoms induces a slight ditrigonal 6 -membered rings (6 MRs) regularization and a 12 -membered rings (12 MR) ellipticity decreasing. Above 200 °C, the degradation and expulsion of SMZ molecules cause a double-six rings (D 6 Rs) tetrahedra cooperative <b>anti-rotation</b> which results in the flattening of the D 6 R itself and in a consequent cell volume contraction. At the same time, a regularization of the ditrigonal 6 MRs and of the elliptical 12 MRs is also observed. Around 400 - 450 °C, in correspondence with the final degradation of SMX, the unit cell volume is still contracting and no further changes in D 6 R and 12 MR are observed until the isotherm is reached. During the heating in the isotherm mode, the unit-cell parameters evolution reaches a plateaux and the SMX content is reduced to zero. After the complete regeneration, the unit-cell volume increases again. This process is followed by an increase in the D 6 R thickness, a ditrigonalization of the 6 MR and by an expansion of the 12 MR which keeps its circular shape. All the features of the pattern and the unit-cell parameters of the starting material [4] are well recovered after cooling down the sample up to room conditions (reverse) and after heating the sample ex situ (ex situ). Conclusions The in situ high-temperature synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction allowed us to demonstrate that the thermal treatment at 575 °C assures a complete regeneration of exhausted Y zeolite. The removal of SMX induces deformations of the framework which do not affect the crystallinity of the sorbing material. These results indicate that high-silica zeolite Y is an affordable material for water clean-up and drug delivery. References [1] B. Hileman, Chem. Eng. News 79 (2001) 31 - 33. [2] I. Braschi, S.
