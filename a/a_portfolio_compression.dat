To facilitate our analysis, we compare the cost of credit risk of <b>a</b> <b>portfolio</b> of over-the-counter derivatives and <b>a</b> <b>portfolio</b> of similar but cleared derivatives.

40|$|Article {{is devoted}} to a problem of {{effective}} distribution of the general budget of <b>a</b> <b>portfolio</b> between the IT projects which are its part taking into ac-count their priority. The designated problem is actual in view of low results of activity of the consulting companies {{in the sphere of}} information technologies. For determination of priority of IT projects the method of analytical networks developed by T. Saati is used. For the purpose of application of this method the system of criteria (indicators) reflecting influence of IT projects of <b>a</b> <b>portfolio</b> on the most significant purposes of implementation of IT projects of <b>a</b> <b>portfolio</b> is developed. <b>As</b> system of criteria the key indicators of efficiency defined when developing the Balanced system of indicators which meet above-mentioned requirements are used. The essence of a method of analytical net-works consists in paired comparison of key indicators of efficiency concerning the purpose of realization of <b>a</b> <b>portfolio</b> and IT projects which are a part of <b>a</b> <b>portfolio.</b> Result of use of a method of analytical networks are coefficients of priority of each IT project of <b>a</b> <b>portfolio.</b> The received coefficients of priority of IT projects are used in the offered model of distribution of the budget of <b>a</b> <b>portfolio</b> between IT projects. Thus, the budget of <b>a</b> <b>portfolio</b> of IT projects is distributed between them taking into account not only the income from implementation of each IT project, but also other criteria, important for the IT company, for example: the degree of compliance of the IT project to strategic objectives of the IT company defining expediency of implementation of the IT project; the term of implementation of the IT project determined by the customer. The developed model of distribution of the budget of <b>a</b> <b>portfolio</b> between IT projects is approved on the example of distribution of the budget between IT projects of the portfolio consisting of three IT projects. Taking into account the received coefficients of priority of IT projects of <b>a</b> <b>portfolio</b> and the offered model of distribution of the budget of <b>a</b> <b>portfolio</b> the admissible volume of costs of each IT project was redistributed. It allowed to distribute more correctly the budget allocated for realization of <b>a</b> <b>portfolio,</b> therefore, allowed to avoid unreasonable expenses at implementation of the IT project of <b>a</b> <b>portfolio.</b>  </p...|$|R
