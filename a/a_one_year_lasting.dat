40|$|This report {{presents}} <b>a</b> <b>one</b> <b>year</b> <b>lasting</b> study. The {{purpose is}} to develop a three dimensional endoscope able to meet the major requirement of his application :low space occupied, high depth resolution and visual comfort. The first part is dedicated to the state of the art, where three methods are specically detailed :sterevision, time of flight camera and structured light analysis. The structured light analysis technique has been selected for the development. Before proceeding to the design of the device itself, a 3 DS Max model has been made as it offers the possibility to optimise the settings such as the pattern used or the geometry of the original device. This model has been providing good pictures required to develop an interface dedicated to optimise the settings involved in such a device, such as the projected pattern and the geometry of the device. First results have shown encouraging results, it is able to compute a 3 D Mesh of the stomach based on the picture taken in a 3 DSMax model. In the second part, a device is proposed which does not require extra space with respect to the design of common endoscopes. The device proposed is based on a diffractive element, a laser and an optical ber bundle and meets the requirements of the application. This device will be developped in further development. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|A 42 -year-old {{man with}} chronic {{hepatitis}} C and ulcerative colitis (UC) {{was referred to}} our hospital in August 2004 because of bloody diarrhea. He was clinically and endoscopically diagnosed with flare of UC. After informed consent had been obtained, he was treated with PEG-IFN-α- 2 a. Four weeks after initiation of PEG-IFN therapy, his abdominal symptoms gradually subsided. Intracellular cytokine assay revealed that the ratio of T-helper (Th) 1 (IFN-?) /Th 2 (IL- 4) increased after IFN therapy. Three months after starting IFN therapy, colonoscopy revealed a normal mucosal pattern. He was uneventfully treated with PEG-IFN-α- 2 <b>a</b> for <b>one</b> <b>year.</b> When <b>last</b> seen in November 2006, {{he was still in}} remission of UC. Our intracellular cytokine data suggested that alteration of Th 1 /Th 2 cytokine balance by IFN is one possible mechanisms of reducing intestinal inflammation in patients with UC. In this regard, IFN therapy could be useful for some patients with UC refractory to other conventional therapies...|$|R

40|$|The project “ Stufen zur Kunst “ is {{initiated}} by the Stiftung Niedersachsen and the Kunstverein Hannover and is presenting in <b>a</b> sequence <b>one</b> <b>year</b> long <b>lasting</b> projects by selected artists which are invited {{to create a new}} site specific piece for the 17 Meter high Staircase in the East wing of the building. Because of it’s minimal and modernist aesthetics it was predestined to become a showcase for commissioning site related exciting new projects by artists. It quickly {{became one of the most}} celebrated art spaces in the city.  Architecture is the starting point for the abstract – geometric drawings, paintings and wall paintings of Lothar Goetz.  His work is a constant play with space, rhythm and form. Elements and architectural details of spaces become integral parts of the works he develops for them. In addition to that it is often writings, films or other memories which inform the works, be it a novel, the fascination about one specific character in it or the description of a specific setting where stories happen. With the elements of form and colour he gives new faces to spaces.  For the 17 meter high staircase in the building of the Hanover Kunstverein Goetz developed a wall painting which reflects upon the movement we do in staircases and the different directions of views which go hand in hand with these movements.  Imagining people going up and down - their directions of views will subsequently crash at several points.  The wall painting starts at feature points of the staircase and through following lines along the wall it fills the space with different coloured triangular shapes until the whole staircase turns into a massive kaleidoscope of coloured shapes.  The different colours give every floor a slightly different appearance and creates an ever changing painting when we experience going up or down...|$|R
