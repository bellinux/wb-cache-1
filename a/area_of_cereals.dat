There are limited areas of fertile greensand {{which can be used}} for intensive vegetable growing, as in the valley of the Western Rother. Historically the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> grown has varied greatly with changes in prices, increasing during the Napoleonic Wars and during and since World War II. The Weald has its own breed of cattle, called the Sussex although it has been as numerous in Kent and parts of Surrey. Bred from the strong hardy oxen, which continued to be used to plough the clay soils of the Low Weald longer than in most places, these red beef cattle were highly praised by Arthur Young in his book Agriculture of Sussex when visiting Sussex in the 1790s. William Cobbett commented on finding some of the finest cattle on some of the regions poorest subsistence farms on the High Weald. Pigs, which were kept by most households in the past, were able to be fattened in autumn on acorns in the extensive oak woods. In his novel Memoirs of a Fox-hunting Man, the poet and novelist Siegfried Sassoon refers to [...] "the agricultural serenity of the Weald widespread in the delicate hazy sunshine".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{challenges}} the widely held view that tariff protection {{was the major}} factor in explaining the poor performance of Spanish agriculture in the half century prior to the 1936 Civil War. After examining the general level of tariffs, {{it is argued that}} these were not sufficient in themselves to explain either the poor diets or weak demand for manufactured goods. Secondly, farmers were slow to switch resources out of cereals, not so much because of the tariffs, but rather because of the limited export opportunities for alternative crops, especially olive oil and wine. Finally, the evidence suggests that those areas which saw {{a significant increase in the}} <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> were just as likely to see a decline in the agricultural population as those that did not, suggesting that the rural exodus was determined by factors other than the tariff. ...|$|E

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the feeding ecology of the red-billed quelea (Quelea quelea) is necessary for a comprehensive assessment of {{the potential impact of}} this species on cereals development. Queleas are reported to subsist primarily on wild Gramineae (Ward 1965 a; Gaston 1976), but their mobility and tendency to feed in large aggregations readily adapts them to becoming a major cereal crop pest (Dyer 2 ̆ 6 Ward 1977). Currently, conflicting evidence exists as to the factors involved in attacks on cereals and the relationship of depredation to the availability of wild foods. In Nigeria, Ward’s (1965 a) findings indicated queleas prefer small wild grass seeds, with cultivated sorghum being extensively damaged only when the supply of grass seeds was depleted. In Ethiopia, however, Jaeger, Erickson 2 ̆ 6 Jaeger (in press) have found queleas dispersing from grassland regions into <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> cultivation where appreciable damage occurs to ripening sorghum at a time when wild grass seeds should be abundantly available. At present the factors affecting depredation <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> are poorly understood.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} various beliefs engendered by the crop circle phenomenon of southern England. It concentrates on the various explanations that have been offered for {{the origin of the}} circles. [...] Crop circles are <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> crop that have been flattened into a symmetrical, geometric, usually circular shape that {{do not appear to be}} explicable in terms of current scientific knowledge. The combination of the anomalous nature of the shapes, their objective reality, and the often stunning beauty of the formations has led to an intensive debate, carried on at all levels of interest, into what causes these shapes, and why. [...] The nature of the phenomenon has foregrounded issues in folk belief, that are often obscured in related fields (eg. UFOs, ghost beliefs, fairy lore), pertaining to the methods by which individuals construct systems of belief and explanations from the evidence presented to them. This thesis proposes to utilise this unique opportunity to demonstrate the folkloric nature of explanation. As such it draws on the concepts of traditions of belief and disbelief, paradigmatic revolutions in systems of thought, and the concept of rationally constructed systems of folk belief to demonstrate the methods by which the various explanations for crop circles have been generated, maintained and disseminated...|$|R
40|$|The {{adoption}} of machinery in agricultural production in Africa {{south of the}} Sahara has been far behind the level of mechanization found in Asia and Latin America.

Population pressure, market access, and agroecological conditions are considered key drivers that cause farmers to find ways to increase productivity and adopt new technologies.

The major critical question becomes how human societies and ecosystems will both, interactively, respond to global change. Such question requires dedicated research infrastructure devoted to long-term ecological research and integrated socioeconomic issues i. e. LTSER. In LTSER, scientific approach has to cope with processes affecting by the interaction between society and nature.

Although in 1841 over 40% of the population were employed in agriculture (including fishing), today less than 2% are so employed. The wide range of soil types in the county leads to great variations in the patterns of farming. The Wealden parts are mostly wet sticky clays or drought-prone acid sands and often broken up into to small irregular fields and woods by the topography, making it unsuitable for intensive arable farming. Pastoral or mixed farming {{has always been the}} pattern here, with field boundaries often little changed since the medieval period. Sussex cattle are the descendants of the draught oxen, which continued {{to be used in the}} Weald longer than in other parts of England. Agriculturalist Arthur Young commented in the early 18th century that the cattle of the Weald [...] "must be unquestionably ranked among the best of the kingdom."

The participants came from different disciplines: genetics, plant breeding, genetic resources, agronomy, plant pathology, soil science, biometry and system analysis, all specialised in the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> production. The approach taken at the workshop was to focus on envisioning the future of sustainable agriculture, especially cereal production.

We followed a strategy commonly used in industrial management based on the premise “imagining the future is shaping the future”. The method “appreciative inquiry” was applied supported by a professional facilitator. Experience shows that this way of working sparks engagement and creativity and that progress and results can be reached within a short time. Focus was on the following topics <b>of</b> relevance to <b>cereal</b> production: - Competition between food and bioenergy, - Soil fertility management, - Economical and legal conditions for variety improvement, - Participation of stakeholders, - Plant breeding strategies, - Food and feed processing improvements, - Sustainable land use.

Second generation biofuels offer potential to contribute towards this target with cereal straw representing a potentially large feedstock source. From an on-farm survey of 240 arable farmers, timeliness of crop establishment and benefits of nutrient retention from straw incorporation were cited as reasons for straw incorporation. However, two-thirds (one-third) of farmers would supply wheat (barley) straw for bioenergy. The most popular contract length and continuous length of straw supply was either 1 or 3 years. Contracts stipulating a fixed <b>area</b> <b>of</b> straw supply for a fixed price were the most frequently cited preferences, with £ 50 t− 1 the most frequently cited minimum contract price that farmers would find acceptable.

40|$|Many {{farmland}} bird species have declined rapidly throughout Europe {{during the last}} 30 years and studies, mainly from the UK, suggest that these declines {{have been caused by}} agricultural intensification. However, since the conditions for farming vary considerably across Europe, the underlying causes of the population declines may also vary. The rate of agricultural intensification has been less dramatic since the mid 1970 s in Sweden than in south-western Europe. Still, I show that population trends of {{farmland bird}}s have declined at least as much in Sweden as in England between 1976 and 2001. Separating population trends in three Swedish landscape types with different patterns of agricultural change showed that the declines were most pronounced in the open plains characterised by intensification and in the forest farmland landscapes characterised by extensification or abandonment. Thus, the observed strong decline of farmland birds in Sweden was probably caused by the dual negative effects of intensification in productive regions and abandonment in marginal farmland. Several species displayed great temporal similarities in population trends within regions in Sweden and in comparison to England. These between population similarities may have been caused by large-scale effects of changing agricultural policies, as farmland bird population trend shifts were closely linked to agricultural policy shifts in Sweden and western Europe. However, {{it is also possible that}} reduced survival at wintering grounds may have had an additional effect because it was especially species that shared European wintering grounds that displayed the strongest between population synchrony in trends. Several farmland bird populations decreased less or even increased during the set-aside policy period (1987 to 1995) when agricultural became less intensive. However, a repeated census of farmland birds between 1994 and 2004 suggested that a general reduction of farming intensity, e. g. by increasing <b>area</b> <b>of</b> set-aside, leys and cultivated pasture, mainly benefit farmland birds in farmland-dominated landscapes where such land-use is rare, whereas a reduced farming intensity was negative for species richness in forest-dominated landscapes. In contrast, in forest-dominated landscapes farmland bird species seemed to benefit from an increased <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> production. My results of landscape–dependent patterns of relationships between farmland bird population changes and changes in land-use highlights the importance of developing new region-specific agri-environmental schemes. The results also suggest that an effective way of changing the present negative trends of farmland birds is a broad change in agricultural policy to reverse the geographical polarisation of farming activities...|$|R
40|$|Field {{survey and}} {{satellite}} image processing methods {{were used to}} estimate the total available forage over an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> 95 034 ha in north-eastern Syria, and to assess grazing impact on the area. The above-ground plant biomass was measured by a quadrat method at three sites in each of eight vegetation classes.

The total above-ground plant biomass and available forage were estimated by extrapolating the measured point data to the whole target area using classified vegetation data by satellite image processing. Grazing impact was assessed by calculating {{the differences between the}} total available forage at the end of growing season and the end of dry season. The values for the estimated total available forage (s. e. of mean) in the area were 55 628 000 (12 920 000) kg DM and 30 007 000 (2 437 000) kg DM at the end of growing season and dry season respectively. Although the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cereal</b> fields covered only 0 · 315 <b>of</b> the <b>area,</b> about 0 · 69 and 0 · 82 of the available forage existed in the harvested cereal fields at the ends of growing season and dry season respectively.

Although these dense herbaceous vegetation types could possibly produce more available forage, they would incur more intensive grazing impact. On the contrary, lighter grazing impact would occur with a higher cover of shrub vegetation types. The importance of maintaining plant cover over the rangeland area to protect the land against soil erosion is stressed. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{agricultural}} intensification, farmland bird populations have been declining dramatically over the past decades. Organic farming is often mentioned to be a possible solution to stop these declines. In order to see whether farmland birds really benefit from organic farming a study was carried out comparing breeding bird densities, breeding success and bird food abundance between organic and conventional arable farms in Flevoland, the Netherlands. skylark (Alauda arvensis) and lapwing were both found in higher densities on organic farms, but for other species no differences were found. Differences in skylark densities were caused by relative large <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> spring <b>cereals</b> grown on organic farms. Differences in lapwing densities were probably caused by higher food abundance and greater availability of suitable breeding habitat on organic farms. In contrast with the higher densities of breeding pairs, indications were found that breeding success of lapwings is lower on organically managed farms. This is {{a result of}} mainly mechanical weeding and other agricultural operations. Also for skylarks breeding on organic farms agricultural operations are the most important cause of nest failure. Greater food availability on organic farms might compensate for this high nest loss through higher chick survival rates. Promotor: G. R. de SnooWith summary in Dutc...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{our study}} {{is to find out}} the {{influence}} of different share <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> and various fertilisation on the grain yield and quality of winter wheat. The long-term field trial with 40, 60 and 80 % share <b>of</b> the <b>cereals</b> and two levels of fertilisation (H 1 mineral fertilisation + organic manure Veget®; H 2 mineral fertilisation only) were carried out in the very warm and dry <b>area</b> <b>of</b> continental weather on luvi-haplic chernozem. In the years 2010 – 2013, the grain yield, the wet gluten content, gluten index, the falling number and sedimentation index of winter wheat according to Zeleny were investigated. The significantly higher grain yield of winter wheat was recorded after preceding crop of common pea. The yield <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> in crop rotation with 60 % share <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> (7. 00 t/ha) was significantly higher than in crop rotation with 80 % share <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> (6. 78 t/ha). The statistically higher wet gluten content after pea fore-crop was found out when the mineral fertilisation and organic fertiliser Veget® were applied (33. 4 %) with comparison to the treatment with mineral fertilisation only (30. 08 %) ...|$|R
