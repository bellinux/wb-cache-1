25|$|Bulk mail is {{mail that}} is {{prepared}} for bulk mailing, often by presorting, and processing at reduced rates. It is often used in direct marketing and other <b>advertising</b> <b>mail,</b> although it has other uses as well. The senders of these messages sometimes purchase lists of addresses (which are sometimes targeted towards certain demographics) and then send letters advertising their product or service to all recipients. Other times, commercial solicitations are sent by local companies advertising local products, like a restaurant delivery service advertising to their delivery area or a retail store sending their weekly advertising circular to a general area. Bulk mail is also often sent to companies' existing subscriber bases, advertising new products or services.|$|E

A study by Boston Consulting Group predicts that overall share of ad-spend in the USA will increase from 11% in to 12% by 2020.

40|$|With {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} full-color digital presses {{in the commercial}} printing industry, personalization has been enabled to create one-to-one marketing communication to enhance the effectiveness of print media advertising. Prior researches showed an increase in response rates with data-driven personalized direct mailings. However, the impact of image personalization on response rate of direct <b>mail</b> <b>advertising</b> is still unknown. This research used an experimental design to test the impact of image personalization on response rate of direct <b>mail</b> <b>advertising.</b> A direct <b>mail</b> postcard campaign was created with three levels of personalization (black-and-white name-only personalization, full-color name-only personalization, full-color name and image personalization) {{to test the hypothesis}} that there are no statistically significant differences between the response rates of direct <b>mail</b> <b>advertising</b> with name-only personalization and with image personalization. The Cost Per Response (CPR) for three levels personalization was also observed. The experimental results showed that the response rates for postcard with full-color name and image personalization was 2. 6 %, and 3. 0 % for full-color name-only personalization. There were no statistically {{significant differences between the two}} levels personalization. Black-and-white name-only personalization postcard turned out to be the most cost effective direct <b>mail</b> <b>advertising</b> with a CPR of $ 20. 50 USD, lower than both full-color name-only personalization ($ 26. 33 USD), and full-color name and image personalization ($ 30. 07 USD) postcard in this case. The reasons for observing these results include consumer behavior towards personalized direct <b>mail,</b> <b>advertising</b> objective, postcard design, product category, timing, and limitations of the experiment. Based on the results, commercial printing companies, especially those provide marketing services need to make a Return-On-Investment (ROI) analysis before recommending the direct <b>mail</b> <b>advertising</b> campaign involving image personalization...|$|R

50|$|For example, if {{a company}} spends $100,000 on a direct mail piece and it {{delivers}} $500,000 in incremental revenue, then the ROMI factor is 5.0. If the incremental contribution margin for that $500,000 in revenue is 60%, then the margin ROMI (the incremental margin for $100,000 of marketing spent) is $300,000 (= $500,000 x 60%). Of which, the $100,000 spent on direct <b>mail</b> <b>advertising</b> will be subtracted and the difference will be divided by the same $100,000. Every dollar expended in direct <b>mail</b> <b>advertising</b> translates to an additional $2 on the company's bottom line.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of measuring market response to a "communications mix" [...] the various means which a firm employs to transmit sales messages to potential buyers. Distributed lag models are applied to time series data for an ethical drug to estimate the short-run, intermediate, and long-run effects on market share of expenditures made for journal <b>advertising,</b> direct <b>mail</b> <b>advertising,</b> and samples and literature. Important differences were found among the communications variables with respect to the magnitude and over-time pattern of effect each had on market share. Significantly, the results indicate that the average historic allocation of resources to alternative communication vehicles has been in inverse relation to measured market response. A variety of econometric checks on the models lends credibility to the results. The managerial implications of the findings are discussed. ...|$|R
