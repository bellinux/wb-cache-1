This research was conducted to gain a better understanding of the filling process in closed pipes and thus try to optimize the filling operations and minimize the risk of damages. An experimental investigation was performed to characterize the inflow front and assess the validity of the vertical front assumption. In these experiments, the upstream reservoir head and the pipe slope were varied, and the inflow front was measured and characterized with the aid of digital camcorders. A piezo-resistive pressure transducer was also used to record the pressure during the filling process. Among other findings, this investigation demonstrated that inflow fronts do not always close the pipe cross-section, invalidating the vertical interface assumption even when proposed criteria for this assumption to be applicable have been satisfied. Two different numerical models, based on the rigid column analysis proposed by Liou and Hunt (1996) and the shock-capturing technique developed by Vasconcelos et al. (2006) were used in this investigation to assess their predictive abilities in simulating the rapid filling of empty pipes. This assessment showed that while the rigid column model reproduces certain aspects of the observed flow, the shock-capturing model was capable of resolving more of the essential features of the flow...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. An on-site wastewater treatment project site with two separate drip fields produced data on emitter flow rates and uniformity after 6 years of operation. The site served a two-bedroom residence in Weslaco, Texas, with treatment through a septic tank and subsurface flow constructed wetland. Filtration was accomplished with a small sand filter and screen filter. Results represent a worst-case scenario because the <b>air</b> <b>relief</b> <b>valves</b> were improperly installed and maintenance on the system was lacking. A pressure compensating (PC) emitter (Netafim Bioline 2. 30 L/hr) and a pressure dependent (PD) emitter (Aqua-Drip 3. 79 L/hr) were evaluated. When new, the PC emitters produced a mean discharge of 2. 33 L/hr with a manufacturing coefficient of 0. 043. The PD emitters, when new, produced a mean discharge of 4. 30 L/hr and a manufacturing coefficient of variation of 0. 016. The testing protocol was verified with the collection of data on new emitters. Two individual drip fields contained PC emitters (Netafim Bioline 3. 50 L/hr) and PD emitters (Aqua-Drip 2. 35 L/hr). The PC emitters were installed in a 200 m continuous length of tubing and the PD emitters were installed with ten individual lines of 15. 24 m connected with a supply and return header. Wastewater with an average BOD? of 23 mg/L was applied to two drip fields for 6 years. Emitter flow rates for 313 PC emitters were reduced to a mean discharge of 0. 95 L/hr with a coefficient of variation of 0. 74 and the 251 PD emitters were reduced to a mean discharge of 1. 52 L/hr with a coefficient of variation of 0. 35. Two shock chlorination treatments with chlorine concentrations of 500 mg/L and 1000 mg/L were used to increase the emitter's flow rate. Sixty PC and 61 PD emitters were evaluated. The initial average flow rate of the PC emitters was 0. 818 L/hr. Average flow rates for the PC emitters increased significantly to 0. 859 L/hr and 0. 954 L/hr following the 500 mg/L and 1000 mg/L shock chlorination treatments, respectively. The initial flow rate of the PD emitters was 1. 54 L/hr. The field flushing cycle represented an increase in flow rate to 1. 60 L/hr. The shock chlorination treatments increased the average flow rate to 1. 71 L/hr and 1. 77 L/hr following the 500 mg/L and 1000 mg/L treatments respectively. All increases in mean discharge were statistically significant. Uniformity and over-application of wastewater were evaluated by analyzing the soil profile on a 1. 22 m grid over the entire drain field. Statistical uniformity was 48. 1 percent and 71. 4 percent for the PC and PD emitters, respectively. The uniformity coefficient resulted in similar results with 70. 1 percent for the PC emitters and 85. 6 percent for the PD emitters. PC and PD fields caused an over-application of 55. 3 percent and 58. 5 percent of the field area, respectively...|$|E

40|$|<b>Relief</b> <b>valves</b> {{are widely}} used in {{industrial}} machinery. Due to the outlet of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> being connected to the tank, the pressure drop of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> is frequently equal to the inlet pressure. Accordingly, the energy loss of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> is very high in some cases and this will worsen {{with an increase in}} the rated pressure of the hydraulic system. In order to overcome the disadvantage of overflow energy loss in a <b>relief</b> <b>valve,</b> a hydraulic energy regeneration unit (HERU) is connected to the outlet of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> to decrease the pressure drop between the inlet and outlet of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve.</b> The overflow loss, which is characterized by the pressure drop, can be reduced accordingly. The approach is to convert the overflow energy loss in hydraulic form and allow for release when needed. The configuration and working principle of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> with HERU is introduced in this present study. The mathematical model is established to obtain the factors influencing the stability of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve.</b> The working pressure of the hydraulic accumulator (HA) is explored. Furthermore, the control process of the operating state of the HA is scheduled to decide whether to regenerate the energy via the HERU. The software AMESim is utilized to analyze the performance and characteristics of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> with HERU. Following this, the test rig is built and used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> with HERU. The experimental results show that the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> with the HERU connected to its outlet can still achieve better pressure-regulating characteristics. The energy regeneration efficiency saved by the HA is up to 83. 6 %, with a higher pre-charge pressure of the HA. This indicates that the proposed structure of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> with HERU can achieve a better performance and higher regeneration efficiency...|$|R

5000|$|In {{high-pressure}} gas systems, it {{is recommended}} that the outlet of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> is in the open air. In systems where the outlet is connected to piping, the opening of a <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> will give a pressure build up in the piping system downstream of the <b>relief</b> <b>valve.</b> This often means that the <b>relief</b> <b>valve</b> will not re-seat once the set pressure is reached. For these systems often so called [...] "differential" [...] <b>relief</b> <b>valves</b> are used. This means that the pressure is only working on an area that is much smaller than the openings area of the valve. If the valve is opened the pressure has to decrease enormously before the valve closes and also the outlet pressure of the valve can easily keep the valve open.
