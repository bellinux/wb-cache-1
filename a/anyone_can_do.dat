The tactics he used failed, as a joke about the unreliability of Wikipedia and what <b>anyone</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to change its contents. Viewers of the show tried to add the episode's mention of the page as {{a section of the}} actual Wikipedia article on negotiation, but this effort was prevented by other users on the article's talk page.|$|E
25|$|Where old disc {{recordings}} {{are considered}} to be of artistic or historic interest, from before the era of tape or where no tape master exists, archivists play back the disc on suitable equipment and record the result, typically onto a digital format, which can be copied and manipulated to remove analog flaws without any further damage to the source recording. For example, Nimbus Records uses a specially built horn record player to transfer 78s. <b>Anyone</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> this using a standard record player with a suitable pickup, a phono-preamp (pre-amplifier) and a typical personal computer. However, for accurate transfer, professional archivists carefully choose the correct stylus shape and diameter, tracking weight, equalisation curve and other playback parameters and use high-quality analogue-to-digital converters.|$|E

It peaked at No. 2 in Sweden and became Fältskog's highest charting UK single to date, reaching No.11.

The title track, [...] "My Colouring Book", is a cover of the song originally recorded by Dusty Springfield. The Observer suggested that [...] "time hasn't diminished her perfect voice." [...] Reviewing the release in The Guardian, Caroline Sullivan wrote: [...] "Agnetha Fältskog has a vulnerability that gets under {{the skin of a}} song. She may be cheating a trifle by including no original material on this collection of 1960s covers, but if <b>anyone</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> justice to the likes of [...] "Sealed with a Kiss", it's her. The soaring sentimentality evokes Cilla Black and Sandie Shaw in their mini-skirted pomp, and I don't say that lightly." [...] The release attracted media attention across Europe, but Fältskog staunchly refused to be involved in any extensive promotion of the album (including personal appearances), and thus limited her public exposure to several short newspaper interviews, a few videos, and a Swedish-language TV special. Yet, the album managed to sell around 500,000 copies worldwide (according to Warner Music), 50,000 of those in the United Kingdom alone. The album became the 10th best-selling of 2004 in Sweden.|$|E
2500|$|Cruyff {{was known}} for his {{technical}} ability, speed, acceleration, dribbling and vision, possessing an awareness of his teammates' positions as an attack unfolded. Despite his unimpressive stature and strength, Cruyff's tactical brain and reading of the game were exceptional. “Football consists of different elements: technique, tactics and stamina,” he told the journalists Henk van Dorp and Frits Barend, in one of the interviews collected in their book Ajax, Barcelona, Cruyff. [...] "There are some people who might have better technique than me, and some may be fitter than me, but the main thing is tactics. With most players, tactics are missing. You can divide tactics into insight, trust and daring. In the tactical area, I think I just have more than most other players." [...] On the concept of technique in football, Cruyff once said: [...] "Technique is not being able to juggle a ball 1,000 times. <b>Anyone</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> that by practising. Then you can work in the circus. Technique is passing the ball with one touch, with the right speed, at the right foot of your team mate." [...] As Van Basten noted, “Johan is so technically perfect that even as a boy he stopped being interested in that aspect of the game. He could do everything when he was 20. That’s why he’s been very interested in tactics since he was very young. He sees football situations so clearly that he was always the one to decide how the game should be played.” In 1997, Dutch journalist Hubert Smeets wrote, [...] "Cruyff was the first player who understood that he was an artist, and the first who was able and willing to collectivise the art of sports." [...] Sports writer David Miller believed Cruyff superior to any previous player in his ability to extract the most from others. He dubbed him [...] "Pythagoras in boots" [...] for the complexity and precision of his passes and wrote, [...] "Few have been able to exact, both physically and mentally, such mesmeric control on a match from one penalty area to another." ...|$|E
