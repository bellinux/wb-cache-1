5|$|After his {{baseball}} career ended, Paciorek {{returned to school}} and {{earned a degree in}} physical education from the University of Houston, a degree that he began to pursue while recovering from back surgery. While acquiring his degree, he became a Christian Scientist and married Linda Cupp. After graduating from college, he spent several years as an instructor at a Jewish community center, then became a physical education teacher after inquiring about a Christian Science Monitor advertisement for a teaching position at Clairbourn School in San Gabriel, California. Linda died of breast cancer in 1987, and Paciorek married Karen Purdy two years later. Paciorek has four sons and four daughters. His nephew, Joey Paciorek, played in the Milwaukee Brewers minor league organization, and his sons, Pete and Mack, had minor league careers as well. While watching his son in training camp, Paciorek became an author after watching what he felt was improper instruction given to the players. He has since written two books, Plato & Socrates, Baseball's Wisest Fans and The Principle of Baseball, and <b>All</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> to Know About Hitting.|$|E

25|$|Reading on the beach, Aschenbach observes Tadzio {{playing on}} the sands.

25|$|Clearly, Wittgenstein did {{not want}} to be a behaviorist, nor did he want to be a cognitivist or a phenomenologist. He is, of course, {{primarily}} concerned with facts of linguistic usage.

25|$|At {{the time}} of the initial congressional proceedings, it was not known if Nixon had known and {{approved}} of the payments to the Watergate defendants earlier than this conversation. Nixon’s conversation with Haldeman on August 1, 1972, is one of several that establishes he did. Nixon said: “Well... they have to be paid. That’s <b>all</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> to that. They have to be paid.” During the congressional debate on impeachment, some believed that impeachment required a criminally indictable offense. Nixon's agreement to make the blackmail payments was regarded as an affirmative act to obstruct justice.|$|E
25|$|The {{so-called}} sympathetic Seattle {{strike was}} an attempted revolution. That {{there was no}} violence does not alter the fact... The intent, openly and covertly announced, was for {{the overthrow of the}} industrial system; here first, then everywhere... True, there were no flashing guns, no bombs, no killings. Revolution, I repeat, doesn't need violence. The general strike, as practised in Seattle, is of itself the weapon of revolution, all the more dangerous because quiet. To succeed, it must suspend everything; stop the entire life stream of a community... That is to say, it puts the government out of operation. And that is <b>all</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> to revolt–no matter how achieved.|$|E
25|$|Out of the {{approximately}} 150 surviving Irish surnames of princely or comital origins, the Eóganachta and their allies account for approximately 30, or about one fifth. Unfortunately their pedigrees are often hopelessly disorganized and confused {{and so it is}} difficult or impossible to tell in many cases which people belong to which septs, or in fact if they even belong to the Eóganachta at <b>all.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> also great evidence in the pedigrees and regnal lists of repeated modification, outright fabrication, and unceremonious deletion, at least for the early period (all concerned sources), with some criticisms quite severe, although this is also a problem with Connachta and Laigin material.|$|E

[...] In Foxfire (1996) she played a drifter who unites four teenage girls against a teacher who has sexually harassed them. Jack Mathews of the Los Angeles Times wrote of her performance, [...] "It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst." ...|$|E

My 'confession' follows and takes place on a Crucifix that I ultimately come down from. This is not a mocking of the church. It is no different than a person wearing a Cross or 'Taking Up the Cross' as it says in the Bible. My performance is neither anti-Christian, sacrilegious or blasphemous. Rather, it is my plea to the audience to encourage mankind to help one another and to see the world as a unified whole. I believe in my heart that if Jesus were alive today he would be doing the same thing.|$|E
500|$|The {{second and}} most {{positive}} review {{was published by}} Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine in July 1818. The reviewer was most impressed with the journal section, particularly its informality and concision: [...] "the perusal of it rather produces the same effect as a smart walk before breakfast, in company with a lively friend who hates long stories". Covertly comparing the work to bluestocking Lady Morgan's recent France (1817), the reviewer found the female writer of History of a Six Weeks' Tour much more favourable: [...] "The writer of this little volume, too, is a Lady, and writes like one, with ease, gracefulness, and vivacity. Above <b>all,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> something truly delightful in the colour of her stockings; they are of the purest white, and much more becoming than the brightest blue." [...] The Monthly Review published a short review in January 1819; they found the first journey [...] "hurried" [...] but the second one better described.|$|E
500|$|An {{exception}} among Junimea promoters was Eminescu, himself {{noted for}} expressing a dissenting social perspective which only partly mirrored Maiorescu's take on conservatism. According to historian Lucian Boia, the [...] "authentic Moldavian peasant" [...] that was Creangă also complemented Eminescu's own [...] "more metaphysical" [...] peasanthood. Similarly, Z. Ornea {{notes that the}} poet used Creangă's positions to illustrate his own ethnonationalist take on Romanian culture, and in particular his claim that rural authenticity lay hidden by a [...] "superimposed stratum" [...] of urbanized ethnic minorities. 20th century critics have described Creangă {{as one of his}} generation's most accomplished figures, and a leading exponent of Junimist literature. This verdict is found in several of Vianu's texts, which uphold Creangă as a great exponent of his generation's literature, comparable to fellow Junimea members Eminescu, Slavici and Ion Luca Caragiale. This view complements George Călinescu's definition, placing the Moldavian author in the company of Slavici and Caragiale as one of the [...] "great prose writers" [...] of the 1880s. Lucian Boia, who noted that [...] "the triad of Romanian classics" [...] includes Creangă alongside Eminescu and Caragiale, also cautioned that, compared to the other two (with whom [...] "the Romanians have said almost <b>all</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> to say about themselves"), Creangă has [...] "a rather more limited register".|$|E

500|$|The {{day after}} the Pepsi {{commercial}} premiered, Madonna released the actual music video for [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] on MTV. Religious groups worldwide including the Vatican immediately protested the clip, saying that it contained blasphemous use of Christian imagery. They called for the national boycott of Pepsi and PepsiCo's subsidiaries, including fast food chains Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut. Pepsi initially wanted to continue airing the commercial, although were {{taken aback by the}} protests. They explained the differences between their advertisement and Madonna's artistic opinions in the video. Ultimately Pepsi gave up to the protests and cancelled the campaign. According to Taraborrelli, the company was so eager to extricate themselves from the collaboration that they even allowed Madonna to keep the $5million advance. In the meantime, Pope John Paul II involved himself in the matter and encouraged fans to boycott the singer in Italy. Protests from a small Catholic organization in the country prompted Italian state television network RAI and Madonna's record company WEA to not air the video there. The video was also deemed offensive by the American Family Association (AFA). Madonna stated that [...] "art should be controversial, and that's <b>all</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> to it", about the controversy.|$|E
500|$|It was Sarah, Duchess of York, who {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} a film based upon the early years of Queen Victoria. She had been interested in the queen since her marriage to Prince Andrew, Duke of York, a great-great-great-grandson of Victoria and Albert, and had written two books about her {{with the help of an}} historian. The Victoria-Albert relationship in particular drew her into the queen's history, as she believed there were parallels between their marriage and her own with Prince Andrew, as they both [...] "fought for their love" [...] in the midst of public scrutiny. A friend set up a meeting with producer Graham King, to whom she pitched the idea along with several others. At the time wrapping up his work on The Departed, King, a native of Britain, had been looking for a project set in his home country for years. The producer later remembered, [...] "she pitched me a bunch of things, and among them was a three-page synopsis of Victoria’s early life: the precise span covered in The Young Victoria. [...] just fell into place." [...] King brought frequent collaborator Martin Scorsese on board as a co-executive producer, as the Academy Award-winning director knew [...] "pretty much <b>all</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> to know about British history".|$|E
500|$|George N. Shorey's {{review of}} the initial seven reel Broadway release {{declared}} it another masterpiece of Mack's writing and notes that the film {{would be the best}} example to go before the courts to argue for [...] "free speech" [...] in films. Shorey notes that the propaganda film [...] "is bold, clear, tremendous in the force of its convincing showing that to drive the scarlet woman from a restricted district into the hotels and apartment houses of a city is a worse crime than it seeks to cure." [...] The only complaint was found that it [...] "does not sufficiently misrepresent the ease and luxury of the underworld. It shows a scarlet woman who finds the [...] "easiest way" [...] truly easy. She does not die, nor even suffer. The intended moral of the picture, that once abandoned to that life a woman finds it to her taste to remain in it and cannot be [...] "reformed," [...] necessarily does include the above corollary to that proposition." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle wrote that the film [...] "deals with a question that has perplexed the sages from the beginning of time and it traverses life's scroll, writing with thought and deed certain actions of everyday application. There are tense dramatic scenes, and above <b>all</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> the question that must be faced, [...] "Who's Your Neighbor?"" ...|$|E
