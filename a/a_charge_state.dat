In order to get comparable efficiencies for <b>a</b> <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> breeder with the stripping scheme, the breeding efficiency in one charge state has to be optimized by narrowing the charge state distribution. In addition good beam quality and thus small emittances are required to achieve best transmission in the following accelerator, which is mandatory for high intensity RIBs.

The STJ cryodetector, theoretically, has no loss in signal response at any mass compared with the reduced signal found at high mass when using a conventional secondary-ionization detector. Since ion detection at high m/z {{is one of the}} fundamental limitations of mass spectrometry (MS), the cryodetector was used to explore the high m/z limit of the MALDI TOF technique for the analysis of two polymer types. Mass spectra were collected for polystyrene at Mn 170, 400, 900, and 2000 kDa and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) at Mn 62. 6 kDa and 153. 7 kDa. For polystyrene, the data showed a trend toward increased aggregation and charge state with mass.

The ESI mass spectrum for cytochrome c in an aqueous solution gives <b>a</b> <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> distribution that ranges from 12 + to 2 +, with a broad, low-intensity peak in the mass-to-charge ratio region corresponding to the [M + H]+ ion. The negative ion ESI mass spectrum for pepsin in 1 % acetic acid solution shows <b>a</b> <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> distribution ranging from 7 − to 2 −. To observe the [M − H]− ion, harsher desolvation and interface conditions were required. Also observed was the abundant aggregation of the proteins with average charge states substantially lower than observed for their monomeric counterparts. The negative ion ESI mass spectrum for cytochrome c in 1 – 100 mM NH 4 OAc solutions showed greater relative abundances for the higher mass-to-charge ratio ions than in acidic solutions, with an [M − H]− ion relative abundance approximately 50 % that of the most abundant charge state peak. The observation that protein aggregates are formed with charge states comparable to monomeric species (at lower mass-to-charge ratios) suggests that the high mass-to-charge ratio monomers may be formed by the dissociation of aggregate species.
