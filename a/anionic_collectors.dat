40|$|AbstractSedimentary {{phosphate}} rock is a precious source for phosphoric acid and fertilizers like NPK. During beneficiation of the ore, typically flotation {{is used for}} purification of the ore from gangue material like carbonates and silicates. A double float process using direct flotation with <b>anionic</b> <b>collectors</b> {{in the first stage}} and reverse flotation with cationic collectors in the second stage serves this purpose well. Carbonates, like dolomite or calcite and silicates are removed from the ore. This study focuses on collectors for the direct flotation of a sedimentary phosphate ore as the first step of purification. The target was to increase the P 2 O 5 recovery to > 90 % at a constant P 2 O 5 grade while separating as much carbonate as possible. Several <b>anionic</b> <b>collectors</b> and combinations thereof were tested. The best results were achieved using an environmentally friendly collector blend which yielded P 2 O 5 recoveries of up to 95 % while lowering the MgO grade from 5. 1 to 4. 1 %...|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{successful}} industrial practice to recover KCl by flotation, the adsorption state of collectors at KCl salt surfaces {{is still not}} fully understood. In this paper, the flotation behavior of KCl and NaCl using different collectors and captive bubble contact angle measurements at KCl and NaCl crystal surfaces in their saturated solutions are reported. The influence of collector concentration and collector structure is considered. The results show that both cationic and <b>anionic</b> <b>collectors</b> produce a hydrophobic state at the structure breaking KCl salt surface, with finite contact angle values of between 30 degrees and 60 degrees. In contrast, the contact angle at the structure making NaCl salt surface is zero at all collector concentrations, suggesting that no collector adsorption occurs, a supposition that is supported by results from molecular dynamics simulation (MDS). Further, {{it appears that the}} presence of surface defects such as edges and corners promote the adsorption of collectors at the KCl surface, and that the flotation is achieved by bubble attachment at the edges/corners of KCl particles with the formation of aeroflocs.

40|$|At the present, zinc is {{produced}} mostly from zinc sulphide ores because the sulphides {{are easy to}} separate from the gangue and to concentrate by conventional flotation techniques {{but in the case}} of oxide zinc ores, the recovery of zinc is not enough high. The objective of the present study is to investigate the influence of different cationic, anionic and mixed collectors on the flotation of smithsonite mineral and an oxide zinc ore at various concentrations and pH values. The present thesis consists of three studies parts. First, characterization of smithsonite mineral and oxide zinc ore from the Angooran ore deposit, Iran, second, physicochemical studies on smithsonite sample include zeta- potential, contact angle, microflotation tests and adsorption studies using diffuse reflectance FTIR (DRIFT) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques in the presence of cationic, anionic and mixed collectors (cationic/anionic) and third, flotation behavior of oxide zinc ore from the Angooran ore in the presence of cationic, anionic and mixed collectors. According to the characterization studies of samples, the size fraction of - 125 + 75 µm is selected as the liberation degree and the result of heavy liquid tests (HLS) confirms it. The results of XPS and EDX on ore samples in different size fractions showed no significant variations in zinc percentage on bulk and surface of samples. The smithsonite flotation results in the presence of dodecylamine after sulphidization using sodium sulphide show a maximum recovery (94 %) at around pH 11. 5. These results are in agreement with obtained zeta-potential and contact angle measurements. Among the used <b>anionic</b> <b>collectors</b> i. e. oleic acid, hexylmercaptan, KAX alone and KAX in the presence of sodium sulphide and copper sulphate, oleic acid indicates a maximum flotation recovery (93 %) at around pH 10. Regarding the mixed collector flotation, the recovery increases with the increasing KAX concentration i. e. the flotation recovery is enhanced to 97 %. Also the recoveries and contact angles are much higher when KAX and DDA alone are used. The spectroscopic data is compared to flotation, zeta potential and contact angle results. The qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the adsorbed layer which causes the surface hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity, are performed using spectroscopic methods (FTIR and XPS). The DRIFT and XPS spectra confirm the adsorption of dodecylamine, oleic acid, hexylmercaptan, KAX and mixed collector (KAX+DDA) on the smithsonite surface. These results are in consistence with obtained zeta-potential, contact angle and also microflotation results. The studies on oxide zinc ore indicate a maximum bench scale flotation recovery of 84. 5 % with zinc grade 24. 5 % in the presence of dodecylamine at pH 11. 5. There are no significant variations in recovery between cationic and anionic and mixed collectors, however, amine and mixed collector flotation are more selective than <b>anionic</b> <b>collectors.</b> The recoveries with mixed collectors show that increasing KAX, the flotation recovery enhances.

Taking into account the anisotropy, zeta potential and complex surface electrical properties of the kaolinite, three surface chemical treatments based on the interacting and absorption of <b>anionic</b> <b>collectors</b> onto the mineral surface, causing {{an increase in the}} contact angle and thus increased hydrophobicity of kaolinite were applied. The methodologies proposed were interactions of kaolinite particles with: sodium dodecyl sulfate solutions with concentration 1 x 10 - 3 M, 1 x 10 - 4 M, 1 x 10 - 5 M; sodium dodecyl sulfate solutions 1 x 10 - 3 M, 1 x 10 - 4 M, 1 x 10 - 5 M with further interaction with kerosene solutions 127000 ppm; and oleic acid solutions 1 x 10 - 3 M, 1 x 10 - 4 M, 1 x 10 - 5 M, each one with a five minutes of interaction. The experimental results obtained by zeta potential and contact angle of the kaolinite before and after applying chemical treatments indicate that larger the chain length of the collector and its concentration, bigger the contact angle and so, more hydrophobic the surface (edge or face).

Synthetic oxide and carbonate powders of the rare earth elements cerium (Ce), praseodymium (Pr), europium (Eu), and terbium (Tb) were tested for this research. Studies were conducted at different pH levels to analyze the kinetics of collector adsorption onto the oxide and carbonate surfaces in attempts to optimize recovery parameters for commercial flotation processes using SHA. In addition, thermodynamic software StabCal was implemented to compare theoretical adsorption {{behavior of}} collectors SHA and octylhydroxamic acid (OHA) on these four rare earth oxides and carbonates. Theoretical points of zero charge were also estimated via StabCal and compared to experimental values to establish validity.

However, results for the carbonates exhibit the opposite trend: strongest SHA adsorption {{was seen in the}} heavy RECs. This pattern correlates to the increasing stability of the carbonate such that ionic diameter of the REs becomes more amenable to chelation due to differences in bonding chemistry.

Recent {{studies have shown that}} the flotation method can be used for pre-processing of trona ore to remove insoluble mineral contaminants for the production of soda ash (sodium carbonate). Studies with carbonate salts suggest that certain important factors can affect their flotation response, including viscosity of the brine and interfacial water structure. Flotation studies showed that contrary to the strong flotation of NaHCO(3) with both <b>anionic</b> and cationic <b>collectors,</b> Na(2) CO(3) does not float at all. Based on the analysis of interfacial water structure in saturated brines, Na(2) CO(3) was found to act as a strong water structure maker, whereas NaHCO(3) acts as a weak water structure maker. Bubble attachment time measurements suggest that collector adsorption at the surface of NaHCO(3) induces flotation; this is not the case for Na(2) CO(3). Contact angle measurements indicated that the surface of Na(2) CO(3) is hydrated to a great extent, whereas the NaHCO(3) Salt surface is less hydrated. These results reveal that there is a strong relationship between the interfacial water structure and the contact angle of these salts. The less stable NaHCO(3) surface is ascribed to the inter-facial water structure which allows for NaHCO(3) flotation with both <b>anionic</b> and cationic <b>collectors.</b> (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Reactions between mineral {{surfaces}} and dissolved species in process water, both inorganic and organic {{play an important}} role in mineral processing. Reverse flotation of finely comminuted iron ore is sometimes employed in order to remove the phosphorous mineral apatite. An <b>anionic</b> <b>collector,</b> designed to specifically adsorb at the calcium specific surface sites of apatite is added, rendering the apatite particles hydrophobic properties. However, some of the collector adsorbs also at the magnetite surfaces, thereby introducing undesired characteristics to the upgraded iron ore concentrate. Of this reason, magnetite and maghemite {{surfaces and}} their interactions with the most abundant and important ions in the process water during flotation, and their potential influence on collector adsorption at magnetite was studied. Maghemite was included in the experiments, since previous work had shown that oxidation of the magnetite surface into maghemite may occur during the processing of the iron ore concentrate. The complex system that the dissolved ions in the process water and the iron oxide particles constitute at flotation and agglomeration was divided into smaller subsystems. The protolytic characteristics for the magnetite-H+ and maghemite-H+ systems proved to be similar when their modelled intrinsic surface complexation constants were compared. However, the surface site density of magnetite was found to be 50 % greater than for maghemite. Both potentiometric titrations and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy were used to study and characterize the adsorption of silicate. The results from the surface complexation modelling suggested that the silicate adsorbed as monodentate surface complexes at the maghemite surfaces. The results showed a silicate adsorption maximum at pH 8. 5 to 9. 5 for both iron oxides. Within this range pH, the surface complex ΞFeOSiO(OH) 2 - was proposed as the dominating surface specie in the maghemite-silicate system. The iron ore pellet additive olivine proved to release substantial amounts of Mg 2 + when immersed in water, indicating that olivine probably is the main source of Mg 2 + to the process water. Thus, the surface characteristic of olivine particles in water suspensions was studied. Since olivine proved to be a significant source of magnesium ions, adsorption of Mg 2 + at maghemite and magnetite was studied and modelled. The results suggested that magnesium ions adsorbed as a mix of mono- and bidentate surface complexes when the number of surface sites was in excess. Increased amounts of Mg 2 + i. e., ≥ 1 Mg 2 + site- 1, resulted in a model including only monodentate surface complexes. Experiments involving competitive adsorption of carbonate and silicate showed that added silicate replaced adsorbed carbonate. Other competitive experiments, with Mg 2 + and Ca 2 +, showed that Mg 2 + had a stronger affinity for the magnetite surface than Ca 2 +. The preferential adsorption of Mg 2 + at the iron oxide surface may then have protective properties, by preventing adsorption of the calcium specific collector. Results from both in-situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and contact angle measurements indicated also that added Mg 2 + reduced the adsorption of collector and thereby increased the wettability of the magnetite surfaces.

In this work, the adsorption of a commercial fatty acid type collector Atrac 1563 as well as four model compounds on synthetic iron oxides was studied in-situ using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). The effect of collector concentration, ionic strength, calcium ions and sodium silicate on the collector adsorption was investigated. The mechanism of adsorption of <b>anionic</b> <b>collectors</b> on iron oxides at pH values above the point of zero charge was found to be similar to that of non-ionic collectors. At pH values above the point of zero charge, sodium cations were found to increase collector adsorption on magnetite by reducing electrostatic repulsion while negatively charged silicate species were shown to reduce collector adsorption by blocking magnetite surface sites. Calcium ions were found to significantly enhance the adsorption and possibly induce precipitation of the collector on magnetite even in the presence of sodium silicate suggesting that a high concentration of calcium in the process water could possibly enhance the contamination of the iron ore with the flotation collector, which has been previously shown to have a negative effect on both flotation and pelletization processes.

In this work, the flotation behavior of arcanite (K 2 SO 4) and epsomite (MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O) with both the cationic collector, dodecylamine hydrochloride (DAH), and the anionic collector, sodium dodecyl-sufate (SDS), has been studied. The results show that K 2 SO 4 can be floated with both the cationic and <b>anionic</b> <b>collectors</b> at natural pH. In contrast, MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O cannot be floated by either collector. The {{results indicate that the}} flotation response of these salts cannot be explained based on surface charge considerations. It is now known that interfacial water structure {{has been found to be}} a significant factor in the explanation of soluble salt flotation. In this regard, the water structure of K 2 SO 4 and MgSO 4 solutions was investigated by FTIR-transmission and FTIR-ATR methods which are useful to detect changes in water structure as influenced by dissolved salts. FTIR transmission spectra suggest that MgSO 4 is a water structure making salt, while it is expected that K 2 SO 4 is a structure breaker, although such an expectation is not confirmed from FTIR transmission spectra due to the low solubility of K 2 SO 4. In this regard, FTIR-ATR measurements can also be used to determine the influence of dissolved salts on water structure. After subtraction of the O–H band spectrum of salt solutions from that of pure water, the change in the “ice-like” water structure as influenced by the dissolved salt (K 2 SO 4 and MgSO 4) can be observed even in solutions of K 2 SO 4 at low concentrations. In summary, the results from FTIR spectroscopy of solutions show that K 2 SO 4 is a water structure breaker, while MgSO 4 is a water structure maker. This conclusion is further confirmed from a macroscopic view point by viscosity measurements. Again for these sulfate salts flotation is achieved with DAH and SDS as collectors if the salt is a water structure breaker...|$|E

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was applied to quantitatively measure the collector adsorption and the surface active sites. The interaction between collectors and minerals was also studied by zeta potential measurements and calculating the adsorption energy using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. It was found that the adsorption of collector OA was through the interaction of amine cations with O atoms by electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding. The highest flotation recovery of kyanite among the three minerals was related to the closest packing arrangement of oxygen atoms which leads to the highest electronegativity and therefore the lowest adsorption energy of OA. In comparison, the adsorption of collector SHS was mainly through the chemical interaction of sulfonate anions with Al atoms.

However, the occurrence of phosphorus intensely disseminated as secondary minerals such as wavellite renders the anionic reverse flotation a challenge. Zeta potential measurements and microflotation tests of wavellite {{with the use of}} <b>anionic</b> and cationic <b>collectors</b> were carried out in this work. The wavellite’s IEP value was achieved at pH 4. 5. Below the IEP value, the surface positively charged sites are made up of aluminum ions. The species H+,Al(OH) 2 +,Al(OH) 2 +,Al 3 +,OH-,H 2 PO 4 -,HPO 42 -, and PO 43 - {{play a role in the}} protonation and deprotonation reactions that will determine the wavellite-solution interface properties. The highest values of wavellite’s floatability under basic pH conditions were achieved in the presence of cationic collectors (1 × 10 − 4 molL− 1). The formation of surface complexes and the precipitation of insoluble salt of aluminum onto wavellite surface seems to be the most likely hypothesis for the chemical nature interactions between amines and wavellite. The surface formation of aluminum oleate on the wavellite’s surface seems to be the most probable hypothesis for the adsorption mechanism and the resultant high floatability of wavellite between pH 7. 5 and pH 10. 0 in the presence of sodium oleate (1 × 10 − 4 molL− 1). The results showed that the cationic reverse flotation of secondary phosphates is a promising route to reduce the phosphorus content of iron ores from deposits that underwent a supergene enrichment process, since wavellite floatability in the alkaline pH range, using amine as collector, was not significantly affected by the presence of corn starch...|$|R
40|$|Iron ore pellets are an {{important}} refined product used as a raw material {{in the production of}} steel. In order to meet the requirements of the processes for iron production, the iron ore is upgraded in a number of steps including, among others, reverse flotation. Under certain circumstances the flotation collector may inadvertently adsorb on the iron ore particles increasing the hydrophobicity of the iron ore concentrate, which in turn has been shown to have an adverse effect on pellet strength. To minimize the influence of the collector on pellet properties, {{it is important to understand}} the mechanism of collector adsorption on iron oxides and how different factors may affect the extent of adsorption. In Papers I-III, the adsorption of a commercial <b>anionic</b> carboxylate <b>collector</b> Atrac 1563 and a number of model compounds on synthetic iron oxides was studied in-situ using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transforms infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. The effect of surfactant concentration, pH, ionic strength, calcium ions and sodium silicate on surfactant adsorption was investigated. The adsorption mechanism of anionic surfactants on iron oxides at pH 8. 5 in the absence and presence of other ions was elucidated. Whereas silicate species were shown to reduce surfactant adsorption, calcium ions were found to facilitate the adsorption and precipitation of the surfactant on magnetite even in the presence of sodium silicate. This implies that a high concentration of calcium in the process water could possibly enhance the contamination of the iron ore with the flotation collector. In Paper III, the effect of calcium, silicate and a carboxylate surfactant on the zeta-potential and wetting properties of magnetite was investigated. It was concluded that a high content of calcium ions in the process water could reduce the dispersing effect of silicate in flotation of apatite from magnetite. Whereas treatment with calcium chloride and sodium silicate made magnetite more hydrophilic, subsequent adsorption of the anionic surfactant increased the water contact angle of magnetite. The hydrophobic areas on the magnetite surface could result in incorporation of air bubbles inside the iron ore pellets produced by wet agglomeration, lowering pellet strength. Based on the adsorption studies, it was concluded that calcium ions could be detrimental for both flotation and agglomeration. Since water softening could result in further dissolution of calcium-containing minerals, an alternative method of handling surfactant coatings on magnetite surfaces was proposed in Paper IV. It was shown that the wettability of the magnetite surface after surfactant adsorption could be restored by modifying the surface with polyacrylate or sodium silicate. In Paper V, the results obtained using synthetic magnetite were verified for natural magnetite. It was illustrated that the conclusions made for the model system regarding the detrimental effect of calcium ions were applicable to the natural magnetite particles and commercial flotation reagents. It was confirmed that polyacrylate and soluble silicate could be successfully used to improve the wettability of the flotated magnetite concentrate. The fact that polyacrylate improved the wettability of magnetite more efficiently at the increased concentration of calcium ions indicates that this polymer is a good candidate for applications in hard water. Finally, it was concluded that in-situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy in combination with zeta-potential and contact angle measurements could be successfully applied for studying surface phenomena related to mineral processing.
