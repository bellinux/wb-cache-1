40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to study the {{consequences}} of the psychological grounded assumption that people?s judgements are biased under uncertainty on the behaviors of agents in an economy represented by a coordination game under incomplete information. I focus particularly on two biases: the <b>avaibility</b> heuristic and optimism. The <b>avaibility</b> heuristic means that when processing information agents give more weight to salient facts than otherwise informative facts. Salient information is often described as vivid as opposed to pallid information. Vivid information is easy to retreave or strike the agent?s attention like private information as opposed to public information. As a consequence, I model an agent suffering from the <b>avaibility</b> heuristic as conditioning his expectation only on his private information even if better, i. e., public information is available. Optimism and means that each agent believes to be cleverer than the average. As a consequence, I model an agent suffering from optimism as believing to be the only one able to forecast the behavior of others. My aim is to contrast the behaviors of agents suffering from these two biases with the behaviors of agents who have rational expectations. That is why I nevertheless maintain the assumption of consistent beliefs. I study a coordination game in incomplete information played by agents who hold these psychological expectations? formations. A coordination game has multiple equilibria that can be Pareto ranked. The selection of a specific equilibrium depends on the expectations each agent has about the behaviors of others, which are themselves conditioned on their expectations about others? behaviors. Therefore the problem of coordination is one of coordinating expectations. I add noise to the canonical coordination game and I study the consequences of these two biases on the way in which agents process information when forming their expectations, on the equilibrium of the economy. I show that when agents hold these expectations? formation, one particular equilibrium is chosen that can account for agents? mistakes. The equilibrium chosen can eventually Pareto dominate the low equilibrium of the underlying coordination game in complete information. I show that the indeterminacy of equilibria is inherent to the joint hypotheses of rationality of agents and common knowledge of rationality. In this case, the structure of the economy is reflexive: The goal of an agent is to forecast the expectations and the behavior of others? agents and they care no more about their private information. coordination games, psychological biases, bounded rationality, equilibrium selection...|$|E

In terms of pomological traits, Citrus hassaku had the highest fruit weight; Pink, Kao Panne and Reinking pomelos had the highest peel thickness and Pomelo WN yielded the highest TSS/TA ratio...|$|E
40|$|One part of {{preventive}} conservation is controlling the lighting in the exhibitions. As {{a first step}} {{we have to accept}} the fact that the very act of displaying objects is causing them damage, and because the trend is for everything to be open to the public view all the time, the aim is to minimize light exposure of exhibits. This essay will present lighting options and relate them to the current recommendations. I have put the emphasis upon describing which methods one can use to minimize the degradation of exhibits on display by eliminating UV- and IR-radiation and reducing the visible light. The intention with this essay is to investigate the current lighting options and compare these to the recommendations on lighting exhibitions. The selections of different lighting options such as LED-, halogen- and energysaving lamps were made based on <b>avaibility.</b> Thereafter I did two types of investigations. The first one was to examine how much luminance, UV- and IR- radiation the lamps gave on 1, 2 and 4 meters and the second one was to determine at which distance you received the recommendations 50 and 200 lux. The results were put in relation to the recommendations and analyzed. The results I had from the investigations are that there are two different types of lamps that are suitable for lighting in museums. These are the LEDsavers 48 and OSRAM halogen spot R 63 ES. The LED lamp is a little bit better because it does not emit any UV- or IR- radiation...|$|E
40|$|Fruits and {{vegetables}} are the common of foodstuffs wich are easily found. They are such kind of necessity wich significant for all family members. Based from WHO advisory, there are found 31 % for heart disease and 11 % for stroke disease in the world because of less consumption of fruits {{and vegetables}} inside the body. The objective {{of this study is to}} know what factors which are affecting the behavior {{of fruits and vegetables}} sonsumption for the children. The variables of the study are Predisposing Factor, which contains of children nutrion education and behaviour. Second is Enabling Factors, wich contains of nutrion education in school and <b>avaibility</b> of fruits and vegetables and last Reinforcing Factors, wich contains of mass media and family. By using the qualitative study/more showing about the perspective subject, the data collection was done by using questionaire, interviewing to the informant directly, and the sample is 8 childrens and triangulation informant contains of parent informant and the learner. The results from correlation of Predisposing factor showed that the necessity of fruits and vegetables consumption was still under WHO recommendation 66, 6 - 166, 6 g/days to 200 - 300 g/days. In Reinforcing factor, there was not a correlation between mother education with fruits and vegetables consumption. Lastly, the result of Enabling factors was the availability about nutrient education at school, the availability of fruits and vegetables in daily consumption and the earnings wich is affecting fruits and vegetables availability. For each family members are suggested to consume fruits and vegetables everyday in order to fulfill the nutrient in family...|$|E

This technology {{is used in}} anticipation {{if there is a}} failure or damage in devices on the server computer that can disrupt the performance on the server network. This study uses the method of failover computer cluster is a method that uses two servers in the form of primary server as the main server and secondary server as backup server, this research through the four main stages of the first Installation and configuration of the next support software Installation and configuration failover cluster. The third stage is the installation and configuration Distributed Replicated Block Device (DRBD). The last stage is testing the server by using siege and nettool. This study was conducted to test the initial server that has not done high <b>avaibility</b> and after done high availbility so that if the main server system failure occurs then the backup server will backup the main server automatically to the backup server to minimize the failure of data accessed by the user. This system is implemented using ubuntu 16. 04 LTS operating system as its operating system. Based on the data tested obtained two data for packet data and responsive time data (ms). Packet data obtained average data sent as much as 233. 3; Average data received as much as 228. 3, average lost as much as 2. 3; While data responsive time (ms) obtained average average as much as 59, 7; Minimum average of 2. 7; Average maximum of 633. 8.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was done to}} determine the effect of L. plantarum and S. cerevisiae innoculated into cocoa pod silage on organoleptic, physical and chemical quality. This experiment consist of four treatments namely silage of fresh harvested cocoa pods without inoculant as control (K); inoculated with L. plantarum (KLp); innoculated with S. cerevisiae (KSc); and innoculated with both L. plantarum and S. cerevisiae mixture (KLp+Sc) was cassava meal added as supplement. Each treatment was replicated 3 time. Ensilage was done for 21 days. Variables observed were properties of organoleptic (i. e. color, odor, texture and existence of fungal), physical (pH), and chemical (i. e. lactic acid content, content of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), crude fiber (CF) and nitrogen free extract (NFE)).  Collected data of organoleptic characteristic were analyzed by non-parametric test (Hedonic KruskalWallis), whereas physical and chemical data analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and followed by Duncan’s New Multiple Range Test for significant difference. Result showed the inoculum have effect (P< 0. 05) on characteristic of organoleptic (color and <b>avaibility</b> fungus) and chemical (dry matter, organic matter, extract ether, and nitrogen free extract content). Silage with inoculation Lp+Sc on silage significantly (P< 0. 05) had higher DM and OM concentration (22. 66 % vs 20. 38 % and 94. 43 % vs 93. 72 %), higher NFE (75. 46 % vs 70. 51 %) and lower EE (0. 15 % vs 0. 87 %, respectively), compared to control. Based on result, it can be concluded that silage with L. plantarum and S. cerevisiae mixture have better quality.

40|$|The {{effect of}} global warming and climate change is {{changing}} the season, included flooding in one area and very dry in other area, changing the temperature and humidity. These changes will trigger changing {{of the life of}} biological agent (virus, bacteria, parasites and so on), variety of animal species, variety of vectors as reservoir host of animal with the role of transmitting the disease to other animal species, This condition will trigger the new animal disease (emerging disease) or old disease will be re-emerged (re-emerging diseases). This paper will discuss the effect {{of global warming}} and climate change on animal diseases in Indonesia such as Bluetongue (BT), Nipah, Japanese encephalitis (JE), West Nile (WN), and Rift Valley fever (RVF). The climate changes such as increasing the earth temperature and rainfall will cause extremely increase of vector population for BT, JE, WN and RVF. In addition, animal transportation and bird migration from one country to others or region will cause changing of ecological system and will open the chance to distribute the diseases. Hence, anticipation on those disease outbreaks should be taken by conducting the surveilance and early detection to those diseases. The possibility of entering Nipah disease in Indonesia should be anticipated because the <b>avaibility</b> of Nipah virus and the reservoir host (Pteropus spp) and also pigs as amplifier host in the surrounding area. Other diseases such as, leptospirosis, anthrax and avian influenza (H 5 N 1) are also have a wider potential to distributing the disease related to the climate change in Indonesia...|$|E
