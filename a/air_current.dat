5|$|A valley exit jet is a strong, down-valley, {{elevated}} <b>air</b> <b>current</b> {{that emerges}} above {{the intersection of}} the valley and its adjacent plain. These winds frequently reach a maximum of 20m/s (45mph or 72km/h) at a height of 40–200 m above the ground. Surface winds below the jet may sway vegetation, but are significantly weaker.|$|E

5|$|By Sunday afternoon, 18hours {{after the}} alarm {{was raised in}} Pudding Lane, the fire had become a raging {{firestorm}} that created its own weather. A tremendous uprush of hot air above the flames was driven by the chimney effect wherever constrictions narrowed the <b>air</b> <b>current,</b> such as the constricted space between jettied buildings, and this left a vacuum at ground level. The resulting strong inward winds did not tend to put the fire out, as might be thought; instead, they supplied fresh oxygen to the flames, and the turbulence created by the uprush made the wind veer erratically both {{north and south of}} the main easterly direction of the gale which was still blowing.|$|E
5000|$|Thermals {{are caused}} by local {{differences}} in temperature, pressure, or impurity concentration in the vertical. Temperature differences can cause <b>air</b> <b>currents</b> because warmer <b>air</b> is less dense than cooler air, causing the warmer air to appear [...] "lighter." [...] Thus, if the warm air is under the cool <b>air,</b> <b>air</b> <b>currents</b> will form as they exchange places. <b>Air</b> <b>currents</b> are caused because of the uneven heating of Earth's surface.|$|R

5|$|In 1906 a major {{explosion}} at a colliery in Courrières, northern France, caused {{the deaths of}} more than 1,000 miners. The subsequent report blamed the accidental ignition of firedamp, exacerbated by coal dust in the air. Concerned that a similar disaster might happen in British collieries, the Royal Commission was formed, reporting back in 1907, 1909 and 1911. The reports led to the Coal Mines Act 1911, which came into force December that year. Among other changes {{to the health and}} safety culture, the act required that ventilation fans in all collieries be capable of reversing the <b>air</b> <b>current</b> underground; this measure was to be implemented by 1 January 1913.|$|E

By the time the ship reached Liverpool, the shipment of peaches had completely decomposed and was utterly worthless.|$|E
25|$|To date, few {{effective}} traps {{for adult}} Asian tiger mosquitoes are available. Those traps that catch {{other species of}} mosquitoes do not catch tiger mosquitoes efficiently. A form of an ovitrap called a lethal ovitrap mimics the breeding site for Ae. albopictus just like the monitoring tool, but it has {{the added benefit of}} contained chemicals that are toxic to the mosquitoes when they enter, but do not harm humans. These traps have had success in some countries to control Aedes mosquito populations. A new trap type has now been shown to catch significant numbers of Ae. albopictus. This device, {{with the help of a}} ventilator, produces an upward <b>air</b> <b>current</b> of ammonia, fatty acids, and lactic acids that takes a similar form and smell of a human body. With the addition of carbon dioxide, the efficacy of the trap is increased. This means a suitable tool is available for trapping adult tiger mosquitoes, and for example, examining the existence of viruses in the trapped mosquitoes. Previously, the mosquitoes had to be collected from volunteers to be studied, which is ethically questionable, especially during epidemics. Recent research also indicates this trap type may also have a use as a control tool; in a study in Cesena, Italy, the number of biting tiger mosquitoes was reduced in places where traps were installed.|$|E

500|$|Forecasters at the SPC {{initially}} {{underestimated the}} atmospheric conditions that would support tornadic development that afternoon and evening; around 4:00a.m. CDT, Doppler radar and wind profile data indicated a [...] jet streak {{along the border}} of California and Nevada, with weather balloon soundings sent up the previous evening by National Weather Service offices in the western United States and numerical computer model data failing to detect the fast-moving <b>air</b> <b>current</b> as it moved ashore from the Pacific Ocean. In addition, the dry line was diffused, with surface winds behind and ahead of the boundary moving into the region from a southerly direction. SPC meteorologists began to recalculate model data during the morning {{to account for the}} stronger wind profiles caused by the jet streak; the data acknowledged that thunderstorms would occur within the Central Plains, but disagreed on the exact area of greatest severe weather risk.|$|E

500|$|Early on October 24, the {{hurricane}} moved northward across the Yucatán Channel {{and entered the}} Gulf of Mexico. Thereafter, the system gradually curved to the northeast as the high pressure weakened and the storm became {{under the influence of}} a southwesterly <b>air</b> <b>current.</b> At 12:00 UTC on October 25, the cyclone weakened to a Category 3 hurricane. About 10 hours later, {{the hurricane}} made landfall near Tarpon Springs, Florida, 115 mph (185 km/h). The storm further weakened to a Category 1 hurricane over Central Florida early on October 26, about six hours before emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near New Smyrna Beach. Reaching the Atlantic with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h), the hurricane briefly re-strengthened to reach winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) early on October 27. It then moved east-southeastward after the high pressure weakened further. Late on October 29, the system accelerated northeastward and weakened to a tropical storm, before being absorbed by a large extratropical cyclone about [...] southeast of Bermuda at 00:00 UTC on October 30. About six hours later, the remnants of the hurricane became indistinguishable.|$|E

[...] That said, the areas round Stirling Town Centre encounter significantly less snow in Winter than many of its very close neighbours such as Denny and Dunblane.

50|$|Intensity also {{increases}} during daytime hours. Burn rates of smoldering logs {{are up to}} five times greater during the day due to lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day which creates <b>air</b> <b>currents</b> that travel uphill. At night the land cools, creating <b>air</b> <b>currents</b> that travel downhill. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the <b>air</b> <b>currents</b> over hills and through valleys. Fires in Europe occur frequently during the hours of 12:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. Wildfire suppression operations in the United States revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. due to the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth.|$|R

The Macintosh is the only mainstream computer platform to have successfully transitioned to a new CPU architecture, and has done so twice. All current Mac models ship with at least 8GB of RAM as standard other than the 1.4GHz Mac Mini, MacBook Pro (without Retina Display), and MacBook <b>Air.</b> <b>Current</b> Mac computers use ATI/AMD Radeon or Nvidia GeForce graphics cards as well as Intel graphics built into the main CPU. All current Macs (except for the MacBook Pro without Retina Display) do not ship with an optical media drive that includes a dual-function DVD/CD burner. Apple refers to this as a SuperDrive. Current Macs include two standard data transfer ports: USB and Thunderbolt (except for the Retina MacBook, which only has a USB-C port and headphone port). MacBook Pro, iMac, MacBook Air, and Mac Mini computers now also feature the [...] "Thunderbolt" [...] port, which Apple says can transfer data at speeds up to 10 gigabits per second. [...] USB was introduced in the 1998 iMac G3 and is ubiquitous today, while FireWire was mainly reserved for high-performance devices such as hard drives or video cameras. Starting with the then-new iMac G5, released in October 2005, Apple started to include built-in iSight cameras on appropriate models, and a media center interface called Front Row that can be operated by an Apple Remote or keyboard for accessing media stored on the computer. Front Row has been discontinued as of 2011, however, and the Apple Remote is no longer bundled with new Macs.|$|E

60|$|He {{had heard}} the bellowings in the gorge the night before after he had lain down to sleep and he had meant to ask Pan-at-lee this morning what manner of beast so {{disturbed}} the slumbers of its betters. He reached {{the foot of the}} cliff and strode into the jungle and here he halted, his keen eyes and ears watchful and alert, his sensitive nostrils searching each shifting <b>air</b> <b>current</b> for the scent spoor of game. Again he advanced deeper into the wood, his light step giving forth no sound, his bow and arrows in readiness. A light morning breeze was blowing from up the gorge and in this direction he bent his steps. Many odors impinged upon his organs of scent. Some of these he classified without effort, but others were strange--the odors of beasts and of birds, of trees and shrubs and flowers with which he was unfamiliar. He sensed faintly the reptilian odor that he had learned to connect with the strange, nocturnal forms that had loomed dim and bulky on several occasions since his introduction to Pal-ul-don.|$|E
60|$|Springing lightly {{from the}} ground he swarmed up the rope toward {{the bow of the}} flier. His weight drew the craft {{slightly}} lower and at the very instant that the man drew himself to the deck at the bow of the vessel, the leading banth sprang for the stern. Gahan leaped to his feet and rushed toward the great beast in the hope of dislodging it before it had succeeded in clambering aboard. At the same instant he saw that others of the banths were racing toward them with the quite evident intention of following their leader to the ship's deck. Should they reach it in any numbers he would be lost. There was but a single hope. Leaping for the altitude control Gahan pulled it wide. Simultaneously three banths leaped for the deck. The craft rose swiftly. Gahan felt the impact of a body against the keel, followed by the soft thuds of the great bodies as they struck the ground beneath. His act had not been an instant too soon. And now the leader had gained the deck and stood at the stern with glaring eyes and snarling jaws. Gahan drew his sword. The beast, possibly disconcerted by the novelty of its position, did not charge. Instead it crept slowly toward its intended prey. The craft was rising and Gahan placed a foot upon the control and stopped the ascent. He did not wish to chance rising to some higher <b>air</b> <b>current</b> that would bear him away. Already the craft was moving slowly toward the tower, carried thither by the impetus of the banth's heavy body leaping upon it from astern.|$|E
