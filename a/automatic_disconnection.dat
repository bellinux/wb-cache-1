25|$|A {{circuit breaker}} is an {{automatically}} operated electrical switch {{designed to protect}} an electrical circuit from damage caused by excess current, typically resulting from an overload or short circuit. Its basic function is to interrupt current flow after a fault is detected. Unlike a fuse, which operates once and then must be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation. Circuit breakers are made in varying sizes, from small devices that protect low-current circuits or individual household appliance, up to large switchgear designed to protect high voltage circuits feeding an entire city. The generic function of a circuit breaker, RCD or a fuse, as an automatic means of removing power from a faulty system is often abbreviated as ADS (<b>Automatic</b> <b>Disconnection</b> of Supply).|$|E

40|$|Since its introduction, {{distributed}} generation (DG) has surely allowed {{the exploitation of}} otherwise unrecoverable energy resources dispersed on the territory, though posing a series of as yet unsolved problems connected to smart grid operation. One of these inconveniences is the <b>automatic</b> DG <b>disconnection</b> in weak network. Actually, for a DG system {{to be able to}} inject power into a grid, the voltage value in its interconnection node must be increased. If voltage exceeds a certain limit, the current Protection System Interface (SPI) will disconnect the generator resulting in the total loss of the energy produced at that node. This paper proposes a number of solutions to the issue, making specific reference to inconveniences that actually occurred in DG systems installed in some Italian rural areas, but that might as well affect areas with higher load densities. During a first phase of the study, the current situations were analyzed and then a circuit model was implemented in a Matlab-Simulink environment to obtain an accurate system simulation. The DG taken into consideration mainly involved photovoltaic systems connected to LV networks, of different sizes and supposedly working in different operating conditions, depending on load demand and weather conditions. The results of the numerical simulation were properly illustrated and discussed, so as to establish the actual validity of the proposed solutions. © 2015 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{restoration}} process of the Swedish bulk-power transmission system following a partial or a total blackout. The two main issues during a restoration are voltage control and frequency control. Special attention is therefore given to the behaviour of network compo-nents, their control equipment and their system automatics as they affect the voltage and frequency regulation during the restoration process. The energizing of the long transmission lines connecting the north of Sweden with the south and {{central part of the}} country will initially result in a large production of reactive power and high voltage levels. In order to compensate for this reactive power production {{there are a number of}} shunt reactors installed.

50|$|Shocks can {{be caused}} by direct or {{indirect}} contact. Contact with an exposed conductive part under fault conditions is called direct contact. IEC requires certain degrees of ingress protection against direct contact. Indirect contact protections can be achieved by earthed equipotential bonding and <b>automatic</b> <b>disconnection</b> of supply by using Residual Current Devices, for example.|$|E
50|$|Until the 1950s, {{isolated}} ground domestic mains supplies {{tended to have}} no Residual-Current Device (RCD) or Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB), and too high a ground impedance to blow a fuse if a live-to-earth fault occurred. This could leave metalwork in the house live. The use of Residual Current Devices (RCDs) or formerly ELCBs with such installs solved this problem. Such installs are called EEBAD (Earthed Equipotential Bonding and <b>Automatic</b> <b>Disconnection).</b>|$|E
50|$|As per rule 100, {{protective}} {{equipment is}} {{to be placed in}} the mines for <b>automatic</b> <b>disconnection</b> of supply when there is earth fault exceeding 750 milliampere in 250 V to 1000 Volt installations. For open cast mine the limit is 50 ampere in installations of voltage exceeding 1100 V and up to 11 kV. The earth leakage current {{is to be}} restricted by placing suitable neutral grounding resistance (NGR) in all the distribution transformers.|$|E
50|$|These {{appliances}} {{must have}} their chassis connected to electrical earth (US: ground) by a separate earth conductor (coloured green/yellow in most countries, {{green in the}} US, Canada and Japan).The earth connection is achieved with a 3-conductor mains cable, typically ending with 3-prong AC connector which plugs into a corresponding AC outlet. The basic requirement is that no single failure can result in dangerous voltage becoming exposed so that it might cause an electric shock and that if a fault occurs the supply will be removed automatically (this is {{sometimes referred to as}} ADS = <b>Automatic</b> <b>Disconnection</b> of Supply).|$|E
50|$|The goal of {{transient}} stability {{simulation of}} power systems is to analyse {{the stability of}} a power system in a from sub-second to several tens of seconds. Stability in this aspect {{is the ability of}} the system to quickly return to a stable operating condition after being exposed to a disturbance such as for example a tree falling over an overhead line resulting in the <b>automatic</b> <b>disconnection</b> of that line by its protection systems. In engineering terms, a power system is deemed stable if the substation voltage levels and the rotational speeds of motors and generators return to their normal values in a quick and continuous manner.|$|E

50|$|In pre-RCD era, the TT {{earthing}} system was unattractive for general use {{because of the}} difficulty of arranging reliable <b>automatic</b> <b>disconnection</b> (ADS) {{in the case of a}} line-to-PE short circuit (in comparison with TN systems, where the same breaker or fuse will operate for either L-N or L-PE faults). But as residual current devices mitigate this disadvantage, the TT {{earthing system}} has become much more attractive providing that all AC power circuits are RCD-protected. In some countries (such as the UK) is recommended for situations where an low impedance equipotential zone is impractical to maintain by bonding, where there is significant outdoor wiring, such as supplies to mobile homes and some agricultural settings, or where a high fault current could pose other dangers, such as at fuel depots or marinas.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{possible}} to have both TN-S and TN-C-S supplies taken from the same transformer. For example, the sheaths on some underground cables corrode and stop providing good earth connections, and so homes where high resistance [...] "bad earths" [...] are found may be converted to TN-C-S. This is only possible on a network when the neutral is suitably robust against failure, and conversion is not always possible. The PEN must be suitable reinforced against failure, as an open circuit PEN can impress full phase voltage on any exposed metal connected to the system earth downstream of the break. The alternative {{is to provide a}} local earth and convert to TT.The main attraction of a TN network is the low impedance earth path allows easy <b>automatic</b> <b>disconnection</b> (ADS) on a high current circuit {{in the case of a}} line-to-PE short circuit as the same breaker or fuse will operate for either L-N or L-PE faults, and an RCD is not needed to detect earth faults.|$|E
50|$|RCDs are {{designed}} to disconnect the circuit {{if there is a}} leakage current. By detecting small leakage currents (typically 5-30 mA) and disconnecting quickly enough (<300 ms), they may prevent electrocution. They are {{an essential part of the}} <b>automatic</b> <b>disconnection</b> of supply (ADS), i.e. to switch off when a fault develops, rather than rely on human intervention, one of the essential tenets of modern electrical practice. There are also RCDs with intentionally slower responses and lower sensitivities, designed to protect equipment or avoid starting electrical fires, but not disconnect unnecessarily the equipment with greater leakage currents in normal operation. To prevent electrocution, RCDs should operate within 25-40 milliseconds with any leakage currents (through a person) of greater than 30 mA, before electric shock can drive the heart into ventricular fibrillation, the most common cause of death through electric shock. By contrast, conventional circuit breakers or fuses only break the circuit when the total current is excessive (which may be thousands of times the leakage current an RCD responds to). A small leakage current, such as through a person, can be a very serious fault, but would probably not increase the total current enough for a fuse or circuit breaker to break the circuit, and certainly not do so fast enough to save a life.|$|E
