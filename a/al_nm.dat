40|$|Spin pumping in Yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) /nonmagnetic-metal (NM) layer systems under {{ferromagnetic}} resonance (FMR) conditions {{is a popular}} method of generating spin current in the NM layer. A good understanding of the spin current source is essential in extracting spin Hall angle of the NM and in potential spintronics applications. It is widely believed that spin current is pumped from precessing YIG magnetization into NM layer. Here, by combining microwave absorption and DC-voltage measurements on YIG/Pt and YIG/NM 1 /NM 2 (NM 1 =Cu or <b>Al,</b> <b>NM</b> 2 =Pt or Ta), we unambiguously showed that spin current in NM came from the magnetized NM surface (in contact with YIG) due to the magnetic proximity effect (MPE), rather than the precessing YIG magnetization. This conclusion is reached through our unique detecting method where the FMR microwave absorption of the magnetized NM surface, hardly observed in the conventional FMR experiments, was greatly amplified when the electrical detection circuit was switched on...|$|E

40|$|The {{critical}} thickness, characteristic for the lattice-mismatch parameter, plays a {{key role}} in the growth of strain layers. The driving force for the 2 D- 3 D transition can be minimized by slowing the relaxation of misfit strain. As a result  the relatively smooth layer is deposited at lower temperature for the optimal growth rate. The quality of the InGaAs- and AlAs-strained layers deposited on InP substrate have been examined by the XRD, AFM and SIMS methods. Atomic force microscopy allows to observe 3 D growth mode even for very thin layers. Relatively strong relaxation effects are recognized by surface roughness. Two-dimensional di!raction measurement is a much more sensitive tool for the estimation of relaxation degree. The observations results were applied in the heterostructure barrier varactor (HBV) diode. In order to minimize the conduction current through HBV two materials with different design of the barriers were studied: one heterostructure with three homogeneous lattice matched barriers consisting of 20 <b>nm</b> <b>Al</b> 0. 48 In 0. 52 As and another one with strained step-like barriers consisting of 5 <b>nm</b> <b>Al</b> 0. 48 In 0. 52 As, 3 nm AlAs and 5 <b>nm</b> <b>Al</b> 0. 48 In 0. 52 As.

Both discharge types are in the collisional regime for impurities (central electron temperature is 0. 4 keV and central density exceeds 10 20 m - 3). In this model, the radial convective velocity is assumed to be determined by the radial electric field, as derived from the pressure gradient. The diffusivity coefficient is chosen to be constant in the plasma core but is significantly larger in the edge region, where it counteracts the high local values of the inward convective velocity. Under these conditions, the faster decay of aluminium in HDH discharges {{can be explained by the}} smaller negative electric field in the bulk plasma, and correspondingly smaller inward convective velocity, due to flattening of the density profiles...|$|R

The textile surfaces investigated are highly irregular and their electrowetting behavior was predicted, in first approximation by Cassie Baxter equation. For both textiles, irreversible electrowetting was observed with a contact angle varying from 120 ° to 70 ° in air. Here again, reversible electrowetting occurs in an oil environment.|$|R

These Al concentrations are representative of levels commonly found in pore waters in the marine environment. In general, the aluminum content of the frustules increased with time of exposure. A maximum increase of the aluminum to silicon mole ratio from 1. 23 × 10 − 3 (day 0) to 3. 14 × 10 − 3 was observed after 14 days of incubation at 500 <b>nM</b> <b>Al.</b> Time series with incubation times from 1 to 21 days at 100 <b>nM</b> <b>Al</b> confirm that the aluminum is rapidly associated with the diatom frustule. The uptake of Al during incubation goes along with a shift in pore structure towards smaller pores. The structural association of aluminum and silicon in biogenic silica was investigated using X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Al–K-edge. Al–K-edge X-ray adsorbtion near edge spectra (XANES) of incubated diatom frustules demonstrate that most aluminum is present in tetrahedral coordination regardless of the Al concentration of the seawater and the duration of exposure. Al–K-edge EXAFS spectroscopy indicates the structural incorporation of aluminum into the Si framework. The results from X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Al–K-edge, the textural changes of diatom frustules during incubation and wet chemical data are all consistent with the formation of an aluminosilicate phase {{on the surface of the}} diatom frustules.
