5|$|Constantinople was {{the nerve}} {{centre of the}} Byzantine state. Had it fallen, the Empire's {{remaining}} provinces would have been unlikely to hold together, and would have become easy prey for the Arabs. At the same time, {{the failure of the}} Arab attack on Constantinople was <b>a</b> <b>momentous</b> event in itself. It marked the culmination of Mu'awiya's campaign of attrition, pursued steadily since 661. Immense resources were poured into the undertaking, including the creation of a huge fleet. Its failure had similarly important repercussions, and represented a major blow to the Caliph's prestige. Conversely, Byzantine prestige reached new heights, especially in the West: Constantine IV received envoys from the Avars and the Balkan Slavs, bearing gifts and congratulations and acknowledging Byzantine supremacy. The subsequent peace also gave a much-needed respite from constant raiding to Asia Minor, and allowed the Byzantine state to recover its balance and consolidate itself following the cataclysmic changes of the previous decades.|$|E

In 1760 the quarrel broke out once more when some Sabbatean elements were discovered among the students of Eybeschutz' yeshivah.

25|$|Sulla left Rome and {{travelled}} to {{the army}} waiting in Nola, the army that the Senate {{had asked him to}} lead against Mithridates. Sulla urged his legions to defy the assembly's orders and accept him as their rightful leader. Sulla was successful and the legions stoned the representatives from the assembly. Sulla then commanded six legions to march with him to Rome and institute a civil war. This was <b>a</b> <b>momentous</b> event, and was unforeseen by Marius, as no Roman army had ever marched upon Rome—it was forbidden by law and ancient tradition.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>momentous</b> {{intensification}} {{of the search}} for allies in Central Europe occurred when the French ruler Francis I was defeated at the Battle of Pavia on February 24, 1525, by the troops of Emperor Charles V. After several months in prison, Francis I was forced to sign the humiliating Treaty of Madrid, through which he had to relinquish the Duchy of Burgundy and the Charolais to the Empire, renounce his Italian ambitions, and return his belongings and honours to the traitor Constable de Bourbon. This situation forced Francis I to find an ally against the powerful Habsburg Emperor, in the person of Suleiman the Magnificent.|$|E

25|$|The {{new city}} {{was filled with}} colonists, {{most of whom were}} young, {{unmarried}} men; and while fugitives seeking asylum helped the population grow, single men greatly outnumbered women. With no intermarriage between Rome and neighboring communities, the new city would eventually fail. Romulus sent envoys to neighboring towns, appealing to them to allow intermarriage with Roman citizens, but his overtures were rebuffed. Romulus then formulated a plan to acquire women from other settlements. He announced <b>a</b> <b>momentous</b> festival and games, and invited the people of the neighboring cities to attend. Many did, in particular the Sabines, who came in droves. At a prearranged signal, the Romans began to snatch and carry off the marriageable women among their guests.|$|E
25|$|New Years Day in 1956 was <b>a</b> <b>momentous</b> {{day for the}} club, as 2,000 spectators {{filled the}} Warrandyte Reserve to watch {{a game against the}} Victoria Cricket Association at the Warrandyte Reserve to {{celebrate}} the club's centenary. After a few postponements due to weather, many local dignitaries attended, and the V.C.A. team consisted of four former Australian test cricketers. On the following Saturday, Centenary Ball was held in the Warrandyte Mechanic Institute and it proved another fine success. The members went to considerable trouble to decorate the hall in the club colours, green and gold and {{at the rear of the}} hall was the club birthday Cake with 100 blazing candles. The highlight of the evening was the presentation of the first Life Membership medallion to Jack Moore by Councillor William F. Betton, who paid a tribute to his fine services to the people of Warrandyte both on and off the sporting field.|$|E
25|$|Today, it is run as {{a museum}} by Manx National Heritage, {{depicting}} {{the history of the}} Kings and Lords of Mann. Most rooms {{are open to the public}} during the opening season (March to October), and all open rooms have signs telling their stories. The exhibitions include a working medieval kitchen where authentic period food is prepared on special occasions and re-enactments of various aspects of medieval life are held on a regular basis, with particular emphasis on educating the local children about their history. Archaeological finds made during excavations in the 1980s are displayed and used as learning tools for visitors. A centre of the school activities at Castle Rushen is the recreation of the preparations and events surrounding the May 1507 visit to the castle by Thomas Stanley, 2nd Earl of Derby and King of Mann. Stanley's visit in 1507 was <b>a</b> <b>momentous</b> occasion as most Kings of Mann rarely if ever visited the island, leaving the governing of the isle to lower ranking officials. The exhibitions at Castle Rushen are part of the Manx National Heritage Story of Mann collection of cultural, historical and heritage sites and attractions. In addition to its functions as a museum, the castle is still in use as an official court house.|$|E

25|$|Rana Prasad Rao of Amarkot duly welcomed Humayun {{into his}} home and {{sheltered}} the refugees for several months. Here, in the household of a Hindu Rajput nobleman, Humayun's wife Hamida Bano, daughter of a Sindhi Shia family, {{gave birth to the}} future Emperor Akbar on 15 October 1542. The date of birth is well established because Humayun consulted his astronomer to utilise the astrolabe and check the location of the planets. The infant was the long-awaited heir-apparent to the 34-year-old Humayun and the answer of many prayers. Shortly after the birth, Humayun and his party left Amarkot for Sindh, leaving Hamida and her child in the custody of their Hindu hosts. A couple of years later, at Humayun's behest, Hamida would leave her infant son in the safety of remote Amarkot and join her husband as he fled into Persia, where her Shia and Persian background would bring influence. The infant Akbar was to live for more than five years, all alone, in the care of a Hindu, Rajput foster-family. This was to have a profound, indelible influence on his views and personality, and <b>a</b> <b>momentous</b> effect on the subsequent history of India. In particular, Akbar developed a strong affinity for the Rajputs, going {{out of his way to}} forge alliances (including marriage alliances) with them, and they would form the bedrock of support for his dynasty for two centuries.|$|E

As such, Deny Flight [...] "represented <b>a</b> <b>momentous</b> act, if only in symbolic terms, in that the alliance assumed a combat mission in a nondefensive capacity and out-of-area".

40|$|Genetic {{algorithms}} (GAs) are multi-dimensional, blind & {{heuristic search}} methods which involves complex interactions among parameters (such as population size, number of generations, various type of GA operators, operator probabilities, representation of decision variables etc.). Our {{belief is that}} GA is robust with respect to design changes. The {{question is whether the}} results obtained by GA depend upon the values given to these parameters is a matter of research interest. This paper studies the problem of how changes in the four GA parameters (population size, number of generations, crossover & mutation probabilities) have an effect on GA’s performance from a practical stand point. To examine the robustness of GA to control parameters, we have tested two groups of parameters & the interaction inside the group (a) Crossover & mutation alone (b) Crossover combined with mutation. Based on calculations and simulation results it is seen that for simple problems mutation plays <b>an</b> <b>momentous</b> role. For complex problems crossover is the key search operator. Based on our study complementary crossover & mutation probabilities is a reliable approach...|$|R
