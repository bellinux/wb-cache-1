40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the significance of the possible negative interaction between aspirin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (<b>ACE)</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> BACKGROUNDSeveral provocative reports have recently suggested that aspirin is unsafe in patients with heart failure and has negative interaction with <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> that might attenuate their beneficial effects upon survival. METHODSWe analyzed mortality data of 11, 575 patients with coronary artery disease screened for the Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention trial. A total of 1, 247 patients (11 %) were treated with <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> Of them, 618 patients (50 %) used aspirin. RESULTSFive-year mortality was lower among patients on <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and aspirin than patients on <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> without aspirin (19 % vs. 27 %; p < 0. 001). After adjusting for confounders, treatment with aspirin and <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> remained associated with lower mortality risk than using <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> only (relative risk [RR] = 0. 71; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 56 to 0. 91). Subgroup analysis of 464 patients with congestive heart failure treated with <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> revealed 221 patients (48 %) on aspirin and 243 patients not on aspirin. Although clinical characteristics and therapy were similar, patients taking aspirin experienced lower mortality than patients who did not (24 % vs. 34 %; p = 0. 001). After adjustment, treatment with aspirin was still associated with lower mortality (RR = 0. 70; 95 % CI = 0. 49 to 0. 99). CONCLUSIONSAmong coronary artery disease patients with and without heart failure who are treated with <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> the use of aspirin was associated with lower mortality than treatment without aspirin. Our findings contradict the claim that aspirin attenuates the beneficial effect of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and supports its use in patients with coronary artery disease treated with <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), mainly excreted by the liver, the dosage of angiotensin-converting enzyme (<b>ACE)</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> cleared by the kidney, must {{be adapted to}} account for renal clearance in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) to avoid acute kidney injury (AKI). Community-acquired AKI {{and the use of}} <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> or ARBs in the emergency department were retrospectively assessed in 324 patients with baseline stage 3 or higher CKD. After stepwise regression analysis, the use of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> (odds ratio [OR], 1. 9; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 1 - 3. 1; P=. 02) and the presence of dehydration (OR, 30. 8; 95 % CI, 3. 9 - 239. 1) were associated with AKI. A total of 45 % of patients using <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> experienced overdosing, which causes most of the excess risk of AKI. These results suggest that dosage adjustment of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> to renal function or substitution of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> with ARBs could reduce the incidence of AKI.

25|$|ACE inhibitors can induce angioedema. ACE inhibitors {{block the}} enzyme ACE {{so it can}} no longer degrade {{bradykinin}}; thus, bradykinin accumulates and causes angioedema. This complication appears more common in African-Americans.

40|$|Introduction: <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> are {{first-line}} {{therapy in}} patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The main adverse effects of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> are hypotension, renal function impairment and hyperkalemia. Areas covered: This paper reviews evidence from clinical studies regarding adverse effects of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> {{in patients with}} CKD. The safety aspects of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> are discussed {{in relation to their}} pharmacological action, drug-drug interactions, drug-diet interaction, precautions needed in certain clinical conditions and other adverse effects. Expert opinion: The main adverse effects of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> follow from their interaction with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) -activity and volume depletion. This interaction can be turned into clinical benefit and increase efficacy of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> by reduction in dietary sodium or adding diuretics. Dual RAAS-blockade is no longer advocated in patients with CKD because of the safety issues, and combination of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> with moderate reduction in dietary sodium intake is a better alternative. The intensified treatment regimens based on <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> can potentially improve renoprotection, but increase the risk of adverse effects. Better strategies to address safety concerns are needed. Introduction of clinical rules and safety indicators may help clinicians to identify hazardous co-prescriptions and adverse dietary habits and can decrease the frequency of adverse effects...|$|R

25|$|Hyperkalemia (high {{concentration}} of potassium in the blood) is another possible complication of treatment with an <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitor</b> {{due to its}} effect on aldosterone. Suppression of angiotensin II leads to a decrease in aldosterone levels. Since aldosterone is responsible for increasing the excretion of potassium, ACE inhibitors can cause retention of potassium. Some people, however, can continue to lose potassium while on an <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitor.</b> Hyperkalemia may decrease the velocity of impulse conduction in the nerves and muscles, including cardiac tissues. This leads to cardiac dysfunction and neuromuscular consequences, such as muscle weakness, paresthesia, nausea, diarrhea, and others. Close monitoring of potassium levels is required in patients receiving treatment with ACE inhibitors {{who are at risk}} of hyperkalemia.|$|E
25|$|Epidemiological and {{clinical}} {{studies have shown}} <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> reduce the progress of diabetic nephropathy independently from their blood pressure-lowering effect. This action of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> {{is used in the}} prevention of diabetic renal failure.|$|R
40|$|Background. There {{is a lack}} of {{information}} on the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (<b>ACE)</b> <b>inhibitors</b> in very old people with heart failure (HF). The objective {{of this study is to}} estimate the prevalence of prescriptions of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> in elderly people with HF discharged from acute care hospitals, and to evaluate the effect of these drugs on 1 -year mortality rates. Methods. We used data from the Gruppo Italiano di Farmacovigilanza nell’Anziano (GIFA). In 1998, we undertook a 1 -year longitudinal study on elderly people (aged 65 þ years) discharged with a diagnosis of HF. We compared the demographic and clinical characteristics associated with a prescription at discharge of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> and used a Cox proportional hazard regression model to calculate the relative hazard of dying associated with the use of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> Results. We enrolled 818 patients in the study with a mean age of 79 years (range: 65 – 101 years). One fourth of the participants were aged 85 years or older. <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> were prescribed to 550 patients (67. 2 %) at discharge. Older age and physical disability were negatively correlated with the use of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> People using <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> had a 40 % reduction of mortality (HR [hazard ratio]: 0. 60; 95 % CI [confidence intervals]: 0. 42 – 0. 88).

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} compliance, persistence, {{and switching}} patterns for angiotensin-converting enzyme (<b>ACE)</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Study Design: Drug-utilization analysis using a large prescription database. Methods: Prescription data {{for more than}} 50, 000 incident users of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> or ARBs were collected, cumulating close to 200, 000 patient-years of medication use. Incidence, drug dosage, 1 -year compliance, long-term persistence, and switching patterns were analyzed. The specific drugs investigated were captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril, ramipril, and fosinopril (<b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors),</b> and losartan, valsartan, irbesartan, candesartan, and olmesartan (ARBs). Results were adjusted for age, sex, starting date, and comorbidities. Results: The 1 -year compliance (88. 3 % vs 88. 3 %, P =. 996) and 3 -year persistence (81. 9 % vs 82. 4 %, P =. 197) rates were similar between <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and ARBs. Users of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> more often switched therapy (24. 2 % vs 13. 1 %, P <. 001), primarily to an ARB. Variations in compliance, persistence, and switching behavior were detected between specific <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> but not between specific ARBs. Conclusions: Although residual confounding and indication bias cannot be ruled out, {{this study showed that}} compliance, persistence, and switching behavior varied between specific <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> but not between specific ARBs. These results support prescribing of cheap generic ARBs as opposed to expensive ARBs. Apart from factors leading to therapy switches, compliance and persistence were similar between <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and ARBs. (Am J Manag Care. 2011; 17 (9) : 609 - 616) ...|$|R

40|$|Background. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (<b>ACE)</b> <b>inhibitors</b> reduce urine protein {{excretion}} {{and slow}} {{the progression of}} renal disease. The beneficial effect in slowing the progression of renal disease is greater in patients with higher urine protein excretion {{at the onset of}} treatment. We hypothesized that the greater beneficial effect of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> on the progression of renal disease in patients with higher baseline levels of proteinuria is due to their greater antiproteinuric effect in these patients. Methods. Data were analyzed from 1860 patients enrolled in I I randomized controlled trials comparing the effect of antihypertensive regimens, including <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> to regimens not including <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> on the progression of non-diabetic renal disease. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between the level of proteinuria at baseline and changes in urine protein excretion during follow-up. The Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to assess the relationship between changes in urine protein excretion during follow-up and the effect of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> on the time to doubling of baseline serum creatinine values or onset of end-stage renal disease. Results. Mean (median) baseline urine protein excretion was 1. 8 (0. 94) g/day. Patients with higher baseline urine protein excretion values had a greater reduction in proteinuria during the follow-up in association with treatment with <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and in association with lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressures (interaction P < 0. 001 for all). A higher level of urine protein excretion during follow-up (baseline minus change) was associated with a greater risk of progression [relative risk 5. 56 (3. 87 to 7. 98) for each 1. 0 g/day higher protein excretion]. After controlling for the current level of urine protein excretion, the beneficial effect of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> remained significant [relative risk for <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> vs. control was 0. 66 (0. 52 to 0. 83) ], but there was no significant interaction between the beneficial effect of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and the baseline level of urine protein excretion. Conclusions. The antiproteinuric effects of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and lowering blood pressure are greater in patients with a higher baseline urine protein excretion. The greater beneficial effect of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> on renal disease progression in patients with higher baseline proteinuria can be explained by their greater antiproteinuric effects in these patients. The current level of urine protein excretion is a modifiable risk factor for the progression of non-diabetic renal disease. <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> provide greater beneficial effect at all levels of current urine protein excretion...|$|R

Results and conclusion: Patients on <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> had higher IGF 1 levels compared with those without <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> In patients on <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> higher IGF 1 values were found in patients with an ejection fraction (EF) less than 40 % compared with EF greater than= 40 %, in patients with higher proBNP levels in quartile 4 vs 1, and in patients with IHD when compared to those without <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> (P less than 0. 001). In patients without <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> no relationship was found between IGF 1 levels and HF or IHD. In multivariate regression, only <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> ECG changes characteristic for IHD, and gender {{had a significant impact on}} IGF 1.

BackgroundMajor randomized clinical trials have established that <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and beta-blockers have life-saving benefits in patients with LV systolic dysfunction. Most patients enrolled in these trials were Caucasian men. Whether an equal effect is achieved in women, non-Caucasians, and patients with major comorbidities has not been established. MethodsThe authors performed a meta-analysis of published and individual patient data from the 12 largest randomized clinical trials of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and beta-blockers to produce random effects estimates of mortality for subgroups. ResultsData support beneficial reductions in all-cause mortality for the use of beta-blockers in men and women, the use of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and some beta-blockers in black and white patients, and the use of <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and beta-blockers in patients with or without diabetes. Women with symptomatic LV systolic dysfunction probably benefit from <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> but women with asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction may not have reduced mortality when treated with <b>ACE</b> <b>inhibitors</b> (pooled relative risk = 0. 96; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 75 to 1. 22). The pooled estimate of three beta-blocker studies supports a beneficial effect in black patients with heart failure, but one study assessing bucindolol reported a nonsignificant increase in mortality.
