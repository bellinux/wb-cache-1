40|$|In recent years, the {{developments}} of wireless {{system that can}} operate over multiband frequency with compact size have enormous growth. In this project, LTCC technology is benefited for miniaturization of multiband antennas for short range medical sensor application. Three antenna designs on LTCC multilayer substrate have been proposed. They are Aperture Coupled antenna (ACA), Dual Patch Microstrip Antenna (DPMA) and Triple Band Off-Center Fed Microstrip Antenna (TBOCFMA). In aperture coupled antenna structure, observation on the controlling parameters of the aperture coupled antenna on LTCC multilayer substrate package is conducted to investigate the effect of <b>aperture</b> <b>slot</b> at various layers with different height. The proposed concept of this idea is simulated on Ferro A 6 M microstrip ceramic substrate and compared with the simulated of aperture coupled antenna on Flame Retardent 4 (FR- 4) substrate at operating frequency of 5. 8 GHz. Thus, the best location of the ground plane that contains the <b>aperture</b> <b>slot</b> has been adopted in DPMA design. In DPMA, dual band frequency spectrum operating at 5. 8 GHz and 6. 3 GHz frequency band has been proposed. This design develops dual radiating patch {{at the top and}} bottom of the overall substrate with the <b>aperture</b> <b>slot</b> at the ground between patches. The second radiating patch is designed to place at the feedline that is innovated from the aperture coupled structure. This design then fabricated and a good agreement was achieved between the simulation and measurement results. Meanwhile, the third design TBOCFMA operating at 5. 8 GHz, 6. 3 GHz and 10 GHz frequency band is presented. This design adopted the dual radiating patch with the <b>aperture</b> <b>slot</b> at the ground between second radiation patch in DPMA. The feedline then was fed with an off-centred feedline technique to create another resonant frequency. Fabrication also has been done for this design for feasibility of study purpose. The complexity of the LTCC technology fabrication process is covered in this thesis...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} how {{to design}} a Radial Line Slot Antenna (RLSA) whose waveguide is filled with high loss dielectric materials. We introduce a new design for the <b>aperture</b> <b>slot</b> coupling synthesis to restrain the dielectric losses and improve the antenna gain. Based on a newly defined slot coupling, a number of RLSAs with different sizes and loss factors are analyzed and their performances are predicted. Theoretical calculations suggest that the gain is sensitive to the material losses in the radial lines. The gain enhancement by using the new coupling formula is notable for larger antenna size and higher loss factor of the dielectric material. Three prototype RLSAs are designed and fabricated at 60 GHz following different slot coupling syntheses, and their measured performances consolidate our theory...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a new Frequency-Reconfigurable Stacked Patch Microstrip Antenna (FRSPMA) {{with a new}} {{coupling}} method {{applied in}} an aperture-coupled technique controlled by the switching circuit is presented. This antenna uses a combination of aperture-coupled technique and stacked patch {{in order for the}} radiating elements to increase the bandwidth. Two shapes (I-shape and H-shape) and sizes of <b>aperture</b> <b>slots</b> are etched onto the ground with a purpose to couple the energy between feedline and stacked patch. One PIN diode switch is integrated in the feed network to control the length of the feedline. A variation of the feedline length controls the selected <b>aperture</b> <b>slots</b> to be active. The waves from the selected activated <b>aperture</b> <b>slots</b> will radiate to particular radiating patch (top or bottom patch) and achieve the frequency reconfigurability. When the switch is in ON mode, the antenna has a capability to configure its operating frequency at 2. 6 GHz and at 3. 5 GHz during the OFF mode. Besides that, the air gap is used to improve and avoid any coupling problem between the <b>aperture</b> <b>slots</b> and both of the two patches. Improper alignment between the <b>aperture</b> <b>slots</b> and patches will interfere waves radiating from <b>aperture</b> <b>slots</b> to the particular patch. In addition, the proposed antenna produces a high gain of more than 5 dB during ON or OFF modes, respectively. The simulated results are compared with measured results...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{drawbacks}} of microstrip patch antenna is its narrow bandwidth. The solution of this problem is to use aperture coupled stacked micro strip patch antenna.

40|$|The {{upper part}} of the figure depicts an aperture-coupled L-band antenna {{comprising}} patterned metal conductor films supported on two thin polyimide membranes separated by an air gap. In this antenna, power is coupled from a microstrip line on the lower surface of the lower membrane, through a slot in a metal ground plane on the upper surface of the lower membrane, to a radiating metal patch on the upper surface of the upper membrane. The two-membrane configuration of this antenna stands in contrast to a three-membrane configuration heretofore considered as the basis for developing arrays of dual-polarization, wideband microwave antennas that could be thin and could be, variously, incorporated into, or supported on, thin structures, including inflatable structures. By reducing the number of membranes from three to two, the present design simplifies the problems of designing and fabricating such antennas or arrays of such antennas, including the problems of integrating such antennas or arrays with thin-membrane-mounted transmit/ receive modules. In addition, the use of <b>aperture</b> (<b>slot)</b> coupling eliminates the need for rigid coaxial feed pins and associated solder connections on thin membranes, making this antenna more mechanically reliable, relative to antennas that include coaxial feed pins. This antenna is designed for a nominal frequency of 1. 26 GHz. The polyimide membranes are 0. 05 mm thick and have a relative permittivity of 3. 4. The radiating patch is square, 8. 89 cm on each side. This radiating patch lies 1. 27 cm above the ground plane. The feeding microstrip line is 0. 12 mm wide and has a characteristic impedance of 50. The aperture-coupling slot, etched in the ground plane, is 0. 48 mm wide and 79. 5 mm long. In order to maximize coupling, the microstrip line is extended beyond the middle of the slot by a length of 36 mm, which corresponds to a transmission- line electrical length of about a quarter wavelength. The other end of the microstrip line is transformed to a 50 -Ohm coplanar waveguide line, which is used for connection to a transmit/receive module. Some plated-through vias are added to the outer conductors of the coplanar waveguide to suppress parallel-plate modes. The measured and calculated 10 -dB-return-loss bandwidth of the antenna is 100 MHz. By eliminating the radiating patch and the upper membrane that supports it, and performing two other simple modifications, one can convert the two-membrane antenna described above to a paper-thin single-membrane antenna, shown in {{the lower part of the}} figure. One modification is to increase the slot length to 104. 95 mm; the other is to extend the microstrip to 36. 68 mm past the middle of the slot. With these modifications, the slot now becomes a half-wavelength radiator with a nearly omnidirectional radiation pattern. In one potential use, such a paper-thin antenna could be pasted on an automobile window to enable omnidirectional communication...|$|E

In this work, nanoscale apertures are produced using focused-ion-beam (FIB) nulling of Si cantilevers, and mask location is defined using a piezoelectrically-driven scanning stage. Experimental verification of the simulations used to model ion-aperture scattering is required. Scanning transmission ion microscopy (STIM) imaging of the apertures mounted above an active detector substrate has been conducted. The analysis of the STIM images that result from thousands of ions {{is complicated by the}} presence of stray ions scattered from upstream beam components which hit the detector substrate outside the area under investigation. A reduction in the fraction of stray ions has been achieved using extra masking of the detector substrate and by use of a <b>slotted</b> <b>aperture.</b> The <b>slotted</b> <b>aperture</b> allows investigation of the tilt alignment in only one dimension at a time whilst providing a large aperture area so that good statistics in the energy spectra of transmitted ions may be acquired.

40|$|Abstract—Specific design {{criteria}} are proposed to mitigate radiated emissions from a resonant enclosure excited by {{a heat sink}} acting as a microstrip patch antenna source. In this par-ticular application, the EMI mechanism {{is assumed to be}} due to coupling from the dominant TM 010 mode to one or more resonant modes associated with the enclosure dimensions. The enclosure is then presumed to radiate, at the enclosure resonance frequencies, through one or more <b>apertures,</b> <b>slots,</b> or seams. The EMI-reduction strategy consists of shifting the resonant frequency of the dominant-patch antenna mode by dielectrically loading the patch antenna with thermal-gasket material having a specified electric permittivity. Specific formulas and graphs will be presented showing how to select the electric permittivity of the thermal-gasket material in order to obtain a given frequency shift. A comparison of experimental measurements with the predictions of the {{design criteria}} indicates that frequency shifts of up to approximately three times the bandwidth of the patch resonance can be predicted with reasonable accuracy.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{efficient}} and innovative techniques to solve electrically large radiation and scattering problems involving arbitrarily shaped tridimensional objects are shown. We started with electromagnetic principles, {{to supply the}} theoretical basis for the numerical methods presented. Then, the Method of Moment (MoM) {{that allows us to}} analyze perfect and imperfect conductors by means of a numerical procedure is shown. Next, to overcome the problems associated with MoM, the Characteristic Basis Function Method (CBFM) has been described. Finally, two new improvements of CBFM have been proposed: the Ultra wide band CBFs (UCBFS) and the technique to solve radiating problem of conformal aperture antenna on PEC structure. The UCBFs are the characteristic basis functions (CBFs) that are derived for the highest frequency in the range of interest. These CBFs, once generated, also capture the electromagnetic behavior of the lower frequencies as well. The use of these bases enables us to solve the scattering for any frequency sample in the band without going through the time-consuming process to generate the CBFs anew. To solve radiating problems involving structure with <b>apertures</b> (<b>slots),</b> we can replace the slots with PEC and by applying the CBFM to the entire structure, using appropriate magnetic current densities as sources, together Plane Wave Spectrum (PWS) excitations.
