5|$|If an {{extraterrestrial}} civilization bearing malice towards humanity gained sufficient {{knowledge of}} terrestrial biology and {{weaknesses in the}} immune systems of terrestrial biota, it might be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> extremely potent biological weapons. Even a civilization without malicious intent could inadvertently cause harm to humanity by not taking account of all the risks of their actions.|$|E
5|$|After the {{discovery}} of a natural circularly permuted protein, researchers looked for a way to emulate this process. In 1983, David Goldenberg and Thomas Creighton were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a circularly permuted version of a protein by chemically ligating the termini to create a cyclic protein, then introducing new termini elsewhere using trypsin. In 1989, Karolin Luger and her colleagues introduced a genetic method for making circular permutations by carefully fragmenting and ligating DNA. This method allowed for permutations to be introduced at arbitrary sites.|$|E
5|$|Although Finn {{has chosen}} {{to stay on the}} {{football}} team, all the other dual members instead quit to remain in the glee club. Ken reverses his ultimatum after a conversation with a dismayed Finn and cancels the extra practice, allowing the football players to again do both activities. Meanwhile, Will and Emma spend more time together while Will prepares the mash-up, and soon realize they have strong feelings for one another. Will decides to remove himself from the equation and later tells Emma and Ken that he will not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> their mash-up.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{found the}} Game Gear port {{to be well}} done given the system's less {{powerful}} technology. Electronic Gaming Monthly staff called {{it one of the}} best portable action games. Richard Leadbetter of Sega Magazine believed that since much of the Genesis verions's playability came from the system's technical capabilities, the Game Gear version suffers in that sense; however, he still believed Treasure was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a fun 8-bit port.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the {{development}} of model membranes confirmed that the lipid bilayer is a stable structure that can exist independent of proteins. By “painting” a solution of lipid in organic solvent across an aperture, Mueller and Rudin were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> an artificial bilayer and determine that this exhibited lateral fluidity, high electrical resistance and self-healing in response to puncture, all of which are properties of a natural cell membrane. A few years later, Alec Bangham showed that bilayers, in the form of lipid vesicles, could also be formed simply by exposing a dried lipid sample to water. This was an important advance, since it demonstrated that lipid bilayers form spontaneously via self assembly and do not require a patterned support structure.|$|E
5|$|Between November 27, 2006, and April 1, 2007, 3329 {{images of}} the star WASP-13 by the SuperWASP-North program based at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in the Canary Islands led to the {{identification}} of WASP-13 as host to a potentially transiting object. Photometric follow-up observations were taken on February 16, 2008 using the James Gregory Telescope (JGT) in Scotland, which took 1047 exposures of the star, although the last twenty images taken were obscured by cloud cover and were discarded. Using HD 80408 as a reference star along with JGT measurements, the astronomers investigating the system were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a light curve for the transiting planet.|$|E
5|$|By September 1943, Neddermeyer's {{team had}} grown from five people to fifty. That month, John von Neumann came to Los Alamos at Oppenheimer's request. Von Neumann was {{impressed}} by the implosion concept and, working with Edward Teller, an old friend, made a series of suggestions. Von Neumann was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a sound mathematical model of implosion, enabling Neddermeyer to present a proposal for a greatly expanded research program. Edwin McMillan and Isidor Isaac Rabi recommended that George Kistiakowsky, who had a specialized knowledge in the precision use of explosives, be brought in to help the program. In February 1944, Kistiakowsky became Parsons' deputy for implosion.|$|E

The self starter housing had to be strong to not crack from bumps in roads. Kettering contacted a new local company, the Dayton Steel Foundry. Walther was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> quickly <b>create</b> a mold <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a housing casting to enclose the self starter.|$|R
5|$|Costa Gomes {{argued that}} African {{soldiers}} were cheaper and were better <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> {{a relationship with}} the local populace, a tactic similar to the 'hearts and minds' strategy being used by United States forces in Vietnam at the time. These Flechas units saw action in the territory at the very end stages of the conflict, following the dismissal of Kaúlza de Arriaga {{on the eve of the}} Portuguese coup in 1974 – the Carnation Revolution. The units were to continue to cause problems for the FRELIMO even after the Revolution and Portuguese withdrawal, when the country splintered into civil war.|$|E
5|$|Dino Crisis {{utilizes}} {{an original}} 3D engine with real-time environments, {{as opposed to}} the pre-rendered backgrounds of the Resident Evil series. Mikami chose a real-time engine to enable better cinematic action and more dramatic character depictions that would otherwise be impossible. However, with the real-time engine came the challenge of hardware limitations, making it difficult for the team to create detailed environments. The team had to forego a jungle scene because of this issue. Mikami did however believe the team was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> sufficiently detailed environments despite the hardware's polygon limitations. Like Resident Evil, the game takes place indoors in an enclosed environment. Mikami wanted to keep the claustrophobic feelings, thinking it was better to build fear.|$|E
5|$|During his lifetime, Leonardo was valued as an engineer. In {{a letter}} to Ludovico il Moro, he claimed to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> all sorts of {{machines}} both {{for the protection of}} a city and for siege. When he fled to Venice in 1499, he found employment as an engineer and devised a system of moveable barricades to protect the city from attack. He also had a scheme for diverting the flow of the Arno river, a project on which Niccolò Machiavelli also worked. Leonardo's journals include a vast number of inventions, both practical and impractical. They include musical instruments, a mechanical knight, hydraulic pumps, reversible crank mechanisms, finned mortar shells, and a steam cannon.|$|E

5|$|Glimmer and Taxable {{were very}} similar operations. They were {{executed}} {{in the early hours}} of 6 June 1944 whilst the invasion fleet was approaching Normandy. Taxable simulated an invasion force approaching Cap d'Antifer and Glimmer threatened Pas-de-Calais. By dropping chaff in progressive patterns, Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> the illusion of a large fleet on coastal radar screens. Beneath the chaff, small boats towed radar reflector balloons and simulated the radio traffic expected of a large fleet. Once German forces were drawn to the coast, it was planned that the RAF would attempt to contain them in this region, and away from Normandy, by bombing bridges and roads.|$|E
5|$|In his {{development}} of the ontological argument, Leibniz attempted to demonstrate the coherence of a supremely perfect being. C. D. Broad countered that if two characteristics necessary for God's perfection are incompatible with a third, {{the notion of a}} supremely perfect being becomes incoherent. The ontological argument assumes the definition of God purported by classical theism: that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect. Kenneth Einar Himma claimed that omniscience and omnipotence may be incompatible: if God is omnipotent, then he should be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a being with free will; if he is omniscient, then he should know exactly what such a being will do (which may technically render them without free will). This analysis would render the ontological argument incoherent, as the characteristics required of a maximally great being cannot coexist in one being, thus such a being could not exist.|$|E
5|$|Jean and Reiss left The Simpsons {{after its}} fourth season {{in order to}} create The Critic, an {{animated}} show about film critic Jay Sherman (voiced by Jon Lovitz); the show was executive produced by Brooks. It was first broadcast on ABC in January 1994 and was well received by critics, but did not catch on with viewers and was put on hiatus after six weeks. It returned in June 1994 and completed airing its initial production run. The Critic was moved to the Fox network for its second season. Since The Simpsons also aired on that network, Brooks was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a crossover between it and The Critic.|$|E

5|$|Kakashi reveals to Naruto that Minato {{intended}} {{to combine the}} Rasengan with his elemental chakra {{but was unable to}} complete the technique. Naruto is able to complete his father's work through the use of shadow clones. In order to perform it, Naruto requires the aid of two shadow clones; he provides the chakra, one clone is responsible for the shape transformation, and the other provides the nature transformation. By manipulating the wind-natured chakra of the Wind Release: Rasengan, Naruto was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> four large points, causing the Rasengan to take on the appearance of a giant fūma shuriken, with the Rasengan in the center remaining a perfect sphere.

5|$|Raëlians {{believe that}} {{humanity}} would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> life on other planets only if humanity is peaceful {{enough to stop}} war. In that case, humanity could travel the distances between stars and create life on another planet. Progress in terraforming, molecular biology, and cloning would enable these teams to create continents and life from scratch. Progress in social engineering would ensure that this creation {{would have a better}} chance of both surviving and having the potential to understand its creators. Research on how civilization would occur on another planet would allow scientists to decide what traces of their origin should be left behind so that their role in life creation would someday be revealed. The progress achieved by the science teams would ultimately sustain a perpetual chain of life.|$|E
