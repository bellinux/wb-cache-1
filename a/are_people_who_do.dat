This does not have to do with morality. It has to do with legality. As human beings, we have to protect them as they are. It has to do with civil liberty," [...] said Congresswoman Julieta López, who pushed the bill, from the centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), whose 19 members voted for the law. Luis Alberto Mendoza, deputy of the center-right National Action Party (PAN), which opposed the law, said it was an [...] "attack against the family, which is society's natural group and is formed by a man and a woman." [...] Other than that, the PCS drew little opposition. Bishop Raúl Vera, who headed the Catholic Diocese of Saltillo, declined to condemn the law. While Vera insisted that [...] "two women or two men cannot get married," [...] he also saw gay people as a vulnerable minority. [...] "Today we live in a society that is composed in a different way. There <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not want to marry under the law or in the church. They need legal protection. I should not abandon these people." [...] Unlike Mexico City's law, once same-sex couples have registered in Coahuila, the state protects their rights no matter where they live in the country. Twenty days after the law had passed, the country's first same-sex civil union took place in Saltillo. It was between 29-year-olds Karina Almaguer and Karla Lopez, a lesbian couple from Tamaulipas. Between 2007 and 2010, 196 same-sex couples had entered into a PCS, none of them had been annulled.|$|E

60|$|There it blew a {{good deal}} and rained in a proportion; my native air was more unkind than man's ingratitude, and I must consent to pass {{a good deal}} of my time between four walls in a house lugubriously known as the Late Miss McGregor's Cottage. And now admire the finger of predestination. There was a schoolboy in the Late Miss McGregor's Cottage, home from the holidays, and much in want of 'something craggy to break his mind upon.' He had no thought of literature; it was the art of Raphael that {{received}} his fleeting suffrages; and with the aid of pen and ink and a shilling box of water colours, he had soon turned one of the rooms into a picture gallery. My more immediate duty towards the gallery was to be showman; but I would sometimes unbend a little, join the artist (so to speak) at the easel, and pass the afternoon with him in a generous emulation, making coloured drawings. On one of these occasions, I made the map of an island; it was elaborately and (I thought) beautifully coloured; the shape of it took my fancy beyond expression; it contained harbours that pleased me like sonnets; and with the unconsciousness of the predestined, I ticketed my performance 'Treasure Island.' I am told there <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not care for maps, and find it hard to believe.

60|$|There was, therefore, both {{in theory}} and practice, some {{security}} for the serf, because {{he had come to}} life and rooted. The seigneur could not wait in the field in all weathers with a battle-axe to prevent the serf scratching any living out of the ground, any more than the man in my fairy-tale could sit out in the garden all night with an umbrella to prevent the shrub getting any rain. The relation of lord and serf, therefore, involves a combination of two things: inequality and security. I know there are people who will at once point wildly to all sorts of examples, true and false, of insecurity of life in the Middle Ages; but these <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not grasp what we mean by the characteristic institutions of a society. For the matter of that, there are plenty of examples of equality in the Middle Ages, as the craftsmen in their guild or the monks electing their abbot. But just as modern England is not a feudal country, though there is a quaint survival called Heralds' College--or Ireland is not a commercial country, though there is a quaint survival called Belfast--it is true of the bulk and shape of that society {{that came out of the}} Dark Ages and ended at the Reformation, that it did not care about giving everybody an equal position, but did care about giving everybody a position. So that by the very beginning of that time even the slave had become a slave one could not get rid of, like the Scotch servant who stubbornly asserted that if his master didn't know a good servant he knew a good master. The free peasant, in ancient or modern times, is free to go or stay. The slave, in ancient times, was free neither to go nor stay. The serf was not free to go; but he was free to stay.|$|E

6000|$|In the fated year I came to {{live with}} my father and mother at Kinnaird, above Pitlochry. Then I walked on the red moors and {{by the side of the}} golden burn; the rude, pure air of our {{mountains}} inspirited, if it did not inspire, us, and my wife and I projected a joint volume of bogey stories, for which she wrote [...] "The Shadow on the Bed," [...] and I turned out [...] "Thrawn Janet" [...] and a first draft of [...] "The Merry Men." [...] I love my native air, but it does not love me; and the end of this delightful period was a cold, a fly-blister and a migration by Strathardle and Glenshee to the Castleton of Braemar. There it blew a good deal and rained in a proportion; my native air was more unkind than man's ingratitude, and I must consent to pass a good deal of my time between four walls in a house lugubriously known as the Late Miss M^cGregor's Cottage.

No child but must remember laying his head in the grass, staring into the infinitesimal forest and seeing it grow populous with fairy armies. Somewhat in this way, as I paused upon my map of [...] "Treasure Island," [...] the future character of the book began to appear there visibly among imaginary woods; and their brown faces and bright weapons peeped out upon me from unexpected quarters, as they passed to and fro, fighting and hunting treasure, on these few square inches of a flat projection. The next thing I knew I had some papers before me and was writing out a list of chapters. How often have I done so, and the thing gone on further! But there seemed elements of success about this enterprise. It was to be a story for boys: no need of psychology or fine writing; and I had a boy at hand to be a touchstone. Women were excluded. I was unable to handle a brig (which the Hispaniola should have been), but I thought I could make shift to sail her as a schooner without public shame. And then I had an idea for John Silver from which I promised myself funds of entertainment: to take an admired friend of mine (whom the reader very likely knows and admires as much as I do), to deprive him of all his finer qualities and higher graces of temperament, to leave him with nothing but his strength, his courage, his quickness, and his magnificent geniality, and to try to express these in terms of the culture of a raw tarpaulin. Such psychical surgery is, I think, a common way of [...] "making character"; perhaps it is, indeed, the only way. We can put in the quaint figure that spoke a hundred words with us yesterday by the wayside; but do we know him? Our friend with his infinite variety and flexibility, we know--but can we put him in? Upon the first, we must engraft secondary and imaginary qualities, possibly all wrong; from the second, knife in hand, we must cut away and deduct the needless arborescence of his nature, but the trunk and the few branches that remain we may at least be fairly sure of.|$|E
