25|$|Adebolajo, born in Lambeth to a Christian family, went to Marshalls Park School {{and studied}} {{sociology}} at the University of Greenwich. He {{has a history of}} involvement in radical Islamist activities and had been arrested at a violent protest and later released. According to Anjem Choudary, a radical Muslim cleric, Adebolajo converted to Islam in 2003 and was linked to the outlawed Islamist group <b>al-Muhajiroun.</b> In 2006, Adebolajo was arrested outside the Old Bailey during a protest about the trial of Mizanur Rahman.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, <b>Al-Muhajiroun,</b> an {{international}} organization seeking {{the establishment of}} a global Islamic caliphate, issued a fatwa declaring that all members of The Al-Fatiha Foundation (which advances the cause of gay, lesbian, and transgender Muslims) were murtadd, or apostates, and condemning them to death. Because of the threat and because they come from conservative societies, many members of the foundation's site still prefer to be anonymous so as to protect their identities while they are continuing a tradition of secrecy.|$|E
25|$|In September 2006, Reid {{addressed}} Muslims in {{a run-down}} part of east London, warning them that fanatics {{were looking to}} groom and brainwash children for suicide bombings. During the speech he was confronted and barracked by Abu Izzadeen, also known as Omar or Trevor Brooks. Mr Brooks is {{a leader of the}} UK-banned Al Ghurabaa, an offshoot of the terrorist-supporting <b>Al-Muhajiroun</b> – a man who many accuse of glorifying terrorism and inciting racial hatred during nightly conversations (often using the nom de plume Abu Baraa) on a New York-based chatroom service.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, <b>Al-Muhajiroun,</b> a banned and {{now defunct}} {{international}} organization who sought {{the establishment of}} a global Islamic caliphate, issued a fatwa declaring that all members of Al-Fatiha were murtadd, or apostates, and condemning them to death. Because of the threat and coming from conservative societies, many members of the foundation's site still prefer to be anonymous so as to protect their identity while continuing a tradition of secrecy. Al-Fatiha has fourteen chapters in the United States, as well as offices in England, Canada, Spain, Turkey, and South Africa. In addition, Imaan, a social support group for Muslim LGBT people and their families, exists in the UK. Both of these groups were founded by gay Pakistani activists.|$|E
500|$|With Omar Bakri Muhammad, Choudary helped form an Islamist organisation, <b>al-Muhajiroun.</b> [...] The group {{organised}} several anti-Western demonstrations, {{including a}} banned protest march in London for which Choudary {{was summoned to}} appear in court. [...] The UK government banned <b>Al-Muhajiroun</b> and Choudary {{was present at the}} launch of its intended successor, Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah. [...] He later helped form Al Ghurabaa, which was also banned. [...] Choudary then became the spokesman for Islam4UK. [...] He has been denounced by mainstream Muslim groups, and has been largely criticised in the country's media.|$|E
500|$|Choudary embraced Islamism and, {{with the}} Islamist militant leader Omar Bakri Muhammed, co-founded <b>al-Muhajiroun</b> a Salafi Wahabi organization. The {{two men had}} met at a local mosque, where Bakri was giving a tafsir (an {{interpretation}} of the Qur'an). [...] In 2002, following a bazaar organised by <b>al-Muhajiroun</b> (advertised by leaflet and word of mouth), Choudary gave a talk on education at Slough. [...] His lecture outlined his ideas for a parallel system of Islamic education in the UK and included elements of the group's ideology. [...] In the same year, although they were refused a permit by the then Mayor of London Ken Livingstone, on 25 August the group held a rally in London. [...] Choudary was summonsed to Bow Street Magistrates' Court in January 2003, on charges which included [...] "exhibiting a notice, advertisement or any other written or pictorial matter", [...] "using apparatus for the amplification of sound", [...] "making a public speech or address" [...] and [...] "organising an assembly".|$|E
500|$|Born in the UK on 18 January 1967, Anjem Choudary {{is the son}} of a Welling market trader and is of Pakistani descent. [...] He {{attended}} Mulgrave Primary School, in Woolwich. In 1996, Choudary married Rubana Akhtar, or Akhgar, who {{was then}} 22 years old and had recently joined <b>al-Muhajiroun,</b> which he led at the time. [...] She later became the group's head of women. [...] The couple have four children.|$|E
500|$|Following his deportation, Choudary {{attended}} the launch in London of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah, the intended successor organisation to <b>al-Muhajiroun.</b> [...] Choudary said that Bakri {{was not on}} the committee of the new group, but that [...] "we would love for the sheikh to have a role." [...] The organisation operates mainly through an invitation-only internet forum, to which Choudary contributes under the screen name Abou Luqman. [...] A reporter visiting the site found calls for holy war, and recordings by Osama Bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and Omar Bakri Mohammed.|$|E
500|$|Choudary {{was also}} a {{spokesman}} for Al Ghurabaa, {{believed to have been}} an offshoot of <b>al-Muhajiroun.</b> [...] It was proscribed in 2006 by the then Home Secretary John Reid. [...] Choudary was outraged: [...] "The easy option when one is losing an argument is to ban the opposition voice. ... We [...] are not a military organisation; we have only been vociferous in our views—views concerning everything from the government's foreign policy in Iraq and Afghanistan to the host of draconian laws, which they’ve introduced against us in this country." ...|$|E
500|$|The UK {{government}} had investigated expelling Bakri {{even before the}} terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, and in July 2003 the headquarters of <b>al-Muhajiroun,</b> and the homes of Bakri and Choudary, were raided by the police. [...] The following year, under new anti-terrorist legislation, the government announced that it wanted to ban <b>al-Muhajiroun.</b> [...] In 2005 Bakri learned that he was at risk of prosecution for his support of the 7 July 2005 London bombers, and in August left the UK for Lebanon, where he claimed that he was on holiday. [...] After leaving a television station where he said [...] "I will not return to Britain unless I want to go there as a visitor or as a tourist", he was detained by Lebanon's general security department and held in a Beirut prison. [...] Several days later, Bakri was excluded from returning to Britain by the Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, on the grounds that his presence in Britain was [...] "not conducive to the public good." [...] Choudary condemned the decision and demanded to know what Bakri had done to justify the ban. [...] He claimed that ministers were inventing rules to ensure that Bakri could not return. [...] In November Choudary and three other followers of Bakri were deported from Lebanon, and returned to the UK. [...] Choudary blamed the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for orchestrating their deportations, claiming that the four were there to help Bakri set up a madrasah.|$|E
500|$|From 14 January 2010, Islam4UK was proscribed {{under the}} Terrorism Act 2000, making {{membership}} illegal and punishable by imprisonment. [...] Choudary condemned the order. [...] In {{an interview on}} BBC Radio he said [...] "we are now being targeted as an extremist or terrorist organisation and even banned for merely expressing that" [...] and [...] "I feel this is {{a failure of the}} concept of democracy and freedom." [...] Following his arrest and subsequent release in September 2014 on suspicion of encouraging terrorism, Choudary claimed he was questioned about his membership of or support for proscribed groups including Islam4UK and Need4Khalifah, both of which the government believes are successors to <b>al-Muhajiroun.</b>|$|E
500|$|Choudary {{referred}} to the 11 September 2001 terrorists as [...] "magnificent martyrs". [...] In 2003 he said that <b>al-Muhajiroun</b> would [...] "encourage people to fulfil their Islamic duties and responsibilities", although {{he also said that}} the group was a political movement and not responsible for individual actions. [...] In 2004 he said that a terror attack on British soil was [...] "a matter of time". [...] He refused to condemn the 7 July 2005 London bombings, but accused the Muslim Council of Britain (who had) of [...] "selling their souls to the devil". [...] He blamed the 2013 murder of Lee Rigby, an off-duty British soldier, on British foreign policy.|$|E
500|$|In 2003 or 2004 he {{organised}} an Islamic-themed camping trip, {{at which}} Bakri lectured, on the [...] {{grounds of the}} Jameah Islamiyah School in East Sussex. [...] Advertised by word-of-mouth, the trip was attended by 50Muslim men, {{most of whom were}} members of <b>al-Muhajiroun.</b> [...] Bakri later claimed the camp's activities included lectures on Islam, football and paintballing. [...] In September 2006, following allegations that it was used in the training and recruitment of terrorists, police searched the school. [...] According to testimony from Al Qaeda suspects held at the Guantanamo Bay detainment camp, in 1997 and 1998 Abu Hamza and groups of around 30of his followers held training camps at the school, which included training with AK47 rifles and handguns, and a mock rocket launcher. [...] No arrests were made, and students and faculty were allowed to return on 23 September 2006, the first day of Ramadan.|$|E
500|$|<b>Al-Muhajiroun</b> {{attempted}} a relaunch in June 2009 at Conway Hall, in Holborn. [...] Several speakers {{were invited to}} share a platform with Choudary, but some later claimed {{that they had been}} invited under false pretences. [...] When the group refused to allow women into the meeting, the chairman of the society which runs the hall cancelled the event. [...] He was heckled by many of those in the audience. [...] Choudary took the microphone from the chairman and led chants of [...] "sharia for UK", saying in reference to the exclusion of women: [...] "Jews and Christians will never make peace with you until you either become like them or adopt their ways." [...] Outside the hall, Choudary criticised British society, and predicted that Muslims would make up the majority within one or two decades. [...] When asked why, if society was so bad, he lived here, he replied: [...] "We come here to civilise people, get them {{to come out of the}} darkness and injustice into the beauty of Islam." ...|$|E
500|$|On 13 December 2013 Choudary led a {{march in}} Brick Lane, {{organised}} by the east London-based Sharia Project, demanding {{a ban on}} alcohol being sold by Muslim establishments. An East London Mosque official, speaking of the patrols, identified The Shariah Project as [...] "strongly linked" [...] to Anjem Choudary's banned group <b>Al-Muhajiroun.</b> Abu Rumaysah of The Shariah Project had predicted [...] "hundreds" [...] would join the demonstration, claiming that groups of Muslims would come {{from as far away}} as the Midlands to take part. In the event, only a few dozen protesters took part in the march. Choudary afterwards explained its purpose: “What we did is we posted a notice to the shop owners saying that under Sharia and under the Koran the sale of alcohol is prohibited and if one were to also drink alcohol, that would be 40 lashes. We were there to teach them that just because they are living among non-Muslims is no excuse because Sharia law will be implemented in Britain, and so they should be aware that just because it is not Sharia today, they can’t just do whatever they like.” Choudary said that the Shariah Project group would be arranging many more such rallies.|$|E
500|$|In November 2008, Choudary {{organised}} {{a meeting}} of the then recently formed Islam4UK, which, according to its website, was [...] "established by sincere Muslims as a platform to propagate the supreme Islamic ideology within the United Kingdom as a divine alternative to man-made law", and to [...] "convince the British public about the superiority of Islam ... thereby changing public opinion in favour of Islam in order to transfer the authority and power ... to the Muslims in order to implement the Sharee’ah (here in Britain)". According to Ed Husain, co-founder of the counter-terrorism think-tank the Quilliam Foundation, Islam4UK was a [...] "splinter group of <b>al-Muhajiroun</b> and Hizb ut-Tahrir, the originators of extremism in Britain." [...] The meeting, advertised as a conference to [...] "rise to defend the honour of the Muslims", was held at the Brady Arts and Community Centre in Tower Hamlets. [...] Choudary then announced that Bakri would be speaking, via a video-conference link, although technical problems meant that his address was instead given over a telephone line. [...] When asked by a Muslim woman how the comments of one of the event's speakers could be justified, with regards to Islam being a religion of peace, Choudary stated, [...] "Islam is not a religion of peace ... It is a religion of submission. [...] We need to submit to the will of Allah." ...|$|E
2500|$|Butt (born 20 April 1990) was a Pakistan-born British citizen {{whose family}} came from Jhelum. He {{grew up in}} Britain, living in Plaistow. He had {{a wife and two}} children. Neighbours told the BBC that Butt had been {{reported}} to police for attempting to radicalise children; he had also expressed disgust at the way women dressed. He was known to police as a [...] "heavyweight" [...] member of the banned extremist group <b>al-Muhajiroun.</b> A BBC interviewee said he had a verbal confrontation with Butt in 2013 on the day after another <b>Al-Muhajiroun</b> follower had murdered Fusilier Lee Rigby.|$|E
2500|$|Butt {{was part}} of an <b>al-Muhajiroun</b> {{campaign}} in 2015 to intimidate Muslims who planned to vote in the UK general elections of that year, on the basis that it was forbidden in Islam. He was known for holding extreme views, having been barred from two local mosques. He appeared in a 2016 Channel 4 Television documentary The Jihadis Next Door, which showed him arguing with police over the unfurling of an ISIL black flag in Regent's Park. [...] According to a friend, he had been radicalised by the YouTube videos of the American Muslim hate preacher Ahmad Musa Jibril.|$|E
2500|$|Luton {{has been}} {{identified}} in the media as a home of people with extremist social and religious viewpoints. The Muslim group <b>Al-Muhajiroun</b> was based there before it was banned, {{and the founder of}} the English Defence League is from Luton. A Muslim protest in March 2009 against soldiers returning from the Iraq War was followed by a counter-demonstration opposing sharia law in the United Kingdom. However, many residents say that the numbers of extremists, both Muslims and far-right, are small. Inayat Bunglawala of the Muslim Council of Britain lives in Luton, and a local representative of Churches Together described [...] "the reality of life in the town" [...] as [...] "a healthy interaction between people of different faiths".|$|E
2500|$|HT {{points out}} that the British government, in a {{classified}} report, discounted the conveyor belt theory, stating [...] "We do not believe that it is accurate to regard radicalisation in this country as a linear 'conveyor belt' moving from grievance, through radicalisation, to violence … This thesis seems to both misread the radicalisation process and to give undue weight to ideological factors." [...] (In reply conservative columnist Andrew Giligan writes: [...] "In fact, at least 19 terrorists convicted in Britain have had links with <b>al-Muhajiroun,</b> including Omar Khayam, sentenced to life imprisonment as leader of the “fertiliser bomb” plot, and Abdullah Ahmed Ali, the ringleader of the airliner “liquid bomb” plot, who is also serving life.") ...|$|E
2500|$|Baran {{argues that}} as members become [...] "impatience {{with the lack}} of success HT has had so far in overthrowing governments", they leave the party to create/join [...] "splinter groups" [...] less wedded to the idea that attacks on [...] "enemies of Islam" [...] must wait for a caliph. [...] Baran lists four groups {{involving}} former HT members, the most noted being Omar Bakri Muhammad's group <b>Al-Muhajiroun.</b> Bakri, Muhajiroun and/or it front groups desire to turn the UK into an Islamist state, have praised the 9/11 hijackers as [...] "magnificent", and bin Laden as [...] "a hero who stands for divine justice and freedom from oppression", claim to have recruited many young British Muslims for ‘military service’ jihad in Afghanistan.|$|E
2500|$|In early October 2012, the Bulgarian daily 24 Chasa gained {{access to}} an {{interview}} with a radical Salafi militant leader, Omar Bakri, who said that he recognized the suspect as being Mehdi Ghezali. After reports surfaced linking Ghezali to the attack, Bakri said that he called [...] "my brothers in Great Britain" [...] to determine the identity of the man, who told him that it was Mehdi Ghezali. In addition, Bakri said that his radical organization, <b>Al-Muhajiroun,</b> intended on paying damages to Mustafa Kyosov, the Muslim bus driver who was killed during the attack, but decided against this, because [...] "Muslims are warned not to hang around near Jews if they don't want to get hurt." [...] Bakri also alleged that Bulgaria and Eastern Europe was considered Islamic territory.|$|E
5000|$|An {{organisation}} {{associated with}} the attacks is the group <b>al-Muhajiroun.</b> According to the BBC, some of the perpetrators became interested in jihad during {{the time they were}} involved with <b>al-Muhajiroun.</b> [...] According to Professor Anthony Glees, director of the Brunel Centre for Intelligence and Security Studies - The fertiliser bomb trial has given us the smoking-gun evidence that groups like <b>al-Muhajiroun</b> have had an important part in radicalising young British Muslims, and that this can create terrorists.|$|E
5000|$|Omar Bakri Muhammad and Anjem Choudary {{are known}} to have led <b>Al-Muhajiroun.</b> [...] Bakri founded <b>Al-Muhajiroun</b> in Mecca, Saudi Arabia on 3 March 1983 {{following}} [...] "the 59th anniversary of the destruction of the Ottoman Caliphate," [...] in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. According to at least one scholar (Sadek Hamid), the group was a front for Hizb ut-Tahrir in the Kingdom (where political parties are illegal). According to Bakri, the Hizb ut-Tahrir leadership did not accept the group. As such, Bakri established <b>Al-Muhajiroun</b> independently from Hizb ut-Tahrir.|$|E
