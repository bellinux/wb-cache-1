The bump is not a significant safety problem; rather it is an expensive maintenance issue. A commonly recommended solution is to integrally attach the <b>approach</b> <b>slab</b> to the bridge abutment, which moves the expansion joint typically found at the approach slab/abutment interface to a location further from the bridge where soil settlement is less of a concern and maintenance is easier. For existing structures the typical maintenance activities, such as adding wedges of asphalt to reduce the bump, are temporary fixes and do not address the underlying problem until the only remaining alternative is replacement of the <b>approach</b> <b>slab.</b> Finding ways rapidly make repairs, and thus decreasing the effects on traffic is critical. One promising solution for reducing construction durations, which the Iowa Department of Transportation has been testing and evaluating, is the use of precast concrete pavement and bridge elements. For this study, two different approach slabs, one being precast concrete and the other being cast-in-place concrete, were integrally connected to twin parallel bridges on Iowa Highway 60. The primary objectives of this investigation were to evaluate: the viability of precast approach slabs, the <b>approach</b> <b>slab</b> performance, and the impacts the approach slabs have on the bridge. The Iowa State University Bridge Engineering Center installed a monitoring system on both bridges and the <b>approach</b> <b>slab</b> systems.

40|$|The current {{design of}} seismically {{isolated}} bridges usually combines the use of bearings and stoppers, as a second line of defence. The stoppers allow {{the development of the}} in-service movements of the bridge deck, without transmitting significant loads to the piers and their foundations, while during earthquake they transmit the entire seismic action. Despite the fact that stoppers, which restrain the transverse seismic movements of the deck, are used frequently in seismically isolated bridges, the use of longitudinal stoppers is relatively rare, mainly due to the large in-service constraint movements of bridges. The present paper proposes a new type of external longitudinal stoppers, which are installed in stiff sub-structures-boundaries, aiming at limiting the bridge seismic movements. The parametric investigation, which was conducted in order to identify the seismic efficiency of the external stoppers, showed that the interaction of the bridge with the stiff boundaries can lead to significant reductions in the seismic movements of the bridge.

40|$|Stress {{distribution}} on {{the bridge}} abutment {{plays a key role}} in the design of bridge abutments. Lateral stress on the abutment will be due to backfill and live loads (wheel loads). Lateral stress due to backfill can be determined by classical earth pressure theories that are well documented in the literature. However, the effect of lateral stress distribution due to live loads/wheel loads are typically assumed as an equivalent uniformly distributed load of additional height of surcharge of backfill over the surface of the backfill. IRC recommendation of 1. 2 m height of surcharge is based on engineering judgment and experience. This study aims to predict the lateral stress on bridge abutment more closely to the actual values. A model was developed using finite element package PLAXIS and the lateral stress distribution on abutment for various lanes are obtained.

Main innovations are the use of recycled aggregates for concrete in the <b>approach</b> <b>slab</b> deck, the use of silica fume concrete for the pavement which performs well from the strength, durability and aesthetic points of view and the formal exploration of irregular longitudinal layouts in truss bridges. This formal exploration resulted in the creation of an internal space extremely pleasant for people and avoiding any tunnel sensation. Moreover, the absence of dynamic loads and the light live load allowed the trusses to be designed without using gusset plates. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

Edwards Industry Advancement Award – is a new highway bridge near Thunder Bay, Canada that utilized a modular construction approach facilitated by the extensive use of ultra-high performance fibre-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) to expedite construction, elevate aesthetic value and enhance quality and durability. Almost all structural components were precast in facilities and assembled on site using UHPFRC joints, which have compact geometries with less complexity, superior durability and strength. The precast elements include a unique UHPFRC pier cap and pier column shells, high performance concrete (HPC) box girders, sidewalks/parapet walls, abutment caps, ballast walls, slope paving panels and <b>approach</b> <b>slabs.</b> Aesthetically, the structure achieved a slender and open form {{with the use of}} shallow precast box girders and a unique pier cap visually and structurally integral with the superstructure. The cap beam was prestressed and precast fully with UHPFRC to overcome design challenges such as geometrical limitations and complex loading. The pier cap and girders were made composite using field-cast UHPFRC joints reinforced with stainless steel bars and threaded bolts. The pier columns also utilized a unique design with precast UHPFRC shells serving as an aesthetic stay-in-place form as well as a protective layer for the salt splashes during Thunder Bay’s harsh winter seasons...|$|R
2500|$|Distress and {{serviceability}} loss {{on concrete}} roads {{can be caused}} by loss of support due to voids beneath the concrete pavement slabs. The voids usually occur near cracks or joints due to surface water infiltration. The most common causes of voids are pumping, consolidation, subgrade failure and bridge <b>approach</b> failure. <b>Slab</b> stabilization is a non-destructive method of solving this problem and is usually employed with other Concrete Pavement Restoration (CPR) [...] methods including patching and diamond grinding. The technique restores support to concrete slabs by filing small voids that develop underneath the concrete slab at joints, cracks or the pavement edge.|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of slabs during rough rolling was simulated {{using the}} Finite Element Method (FEM) under various friction coefficients. The plastic strain distribution and the shear strain in slabs during {{vertical and horizontal}} rolling were obtained for both the flat vertical roll and the grooved vertical roll. With increase of friction coefficients between the slab and the rolls, the maximum plastic strain in the <b>slab</b> gradually <b>approaches</b> the <b>slab</b> corner which might result in the edge and corner cracks in slab, {{and the difference between}} the maximum and the minimum shear strains increases, which might result in uneven distribution of texture across the slab in the vertical – horizontal rolling process...|$|R
