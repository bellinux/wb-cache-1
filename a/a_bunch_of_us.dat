They go off in pairs, thirty seconds apart, and after dark you can’t see them; you just hear a roar. But a moment later you’ll see the flame, from the tail cone, coming out of the fighter.

He also suggested adding a cow, to represent the Goddess Hathor. We did have a cow prepared, painted with mythic symbols, but the police stopped it from getting near the Pentagon.

5000|$|On December 13, 1984 Gil {{wrote about}} how he earned the Purple Heart.… 40 years ago today I was a 19 year old combat infantryman in C. F, 309th Inf.Regt., 78th Inf. Division, {{participating}} in {{an attack on the}} German Wehrmacht in theHürtgen Forest in the Ardennes. Freezing cold -- snow covering everything -- in thepre-dawn darkness a flare fired from the German lines suddenly lit up the area andrevealed my company moving down a road - mortar shells and 88 shells began to fallin our midst almost immediately. My friends started dropping all around me - severalkilled instantly, others fatally wounded. I felt a blow on my left leg like someonehad hit me with a baseball bat. I hit the ground and crawled off the road into a lowspot. I realized I had dropped the spare barrel for my machine gun and crawled backout on the road and retrieved it. The company commander (Captain Brey - later killedinstantly) came up and told us to go with him and he would deploy us in the woods. We went in and established our line and came under machine gun fire and mortar fireand more of our company were killed. The captain told us to dig in and I started todig a foxhole in the frozen ground but by this time my leg really hurt and Icouldn’t stand on it and my boot was full of blood. I crawled over to Captain Breyand told him I had been hit in the leg and he told me {{to go back to the}} battalionaid station, which was several hundred yards back near the area where I was woundedin the first place. I had to crawl on my stomach the whole way as the area was underheavy fire but I made it. The medic at the battalion cut off my boot and bandaged myleg and gave me some sulfa pills. Then they put me in a jeep with some other woundedguys - a couple of stretchers and the jeep tore off at high speed for the regimentalaid station under artillery fire most of the way. We finally made it to the aidstation set up in a house and there were a couple of surgeons there working on themost severely wounded. There were quite a few bodies there and numerous guys withsevere head or chest wounds and obviously dying. I was put in an ambulance withseveral others and taken to a railhead where hospital trains were taking the woundedback into France. I don’t remember too much about that except a nurse came aroundevery few hours and gave me a shot of penicillin (pretty new stuff then) and wefinally arrived at Paris where we were taken to a large hospital. A chaplain camearound one day with a copy of general orders awarding <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> the PurpleHeart. I still have my copy. After a week some of us were flown over to England inDC-3’s. I remember all the air force crew had parachutes but none of us wounded hadone. I asked one of the crew what we did if the Luftwaffe shot us down. He said“tough shit buddy.” Fortunately, we made it and when I arrived at the hospital inEngland I was pretty sure that I had probably survived the war. When I look back andrealize how close I came to death at the age of 19 it doesn’t seem possible that Iactually went through that experience and am alive and well today.On Friday October 25, 1985, he again remembered the war when he wrote about a tripto Europe when he worked at Kew and went sightseeing in London. “On the way toTrafalgar Square we and Pat stopped at the site of the War Room in the CabinetBuilding along St. James Park and toured the restored War Museum -very fascinatingto me since I was there at that time and lived through a lot of the history myself.”He remarked that his bad feet, perhaps never recovered from the war, suffered fromthe long walks of sightseeing. On his 72nd birthday (15 January 1997), Gilreflected, “I’m glad to be here when I look back to when I was 19 in the HürtgenForest in December 1944 and didn’t know if I would even get to be 20.” ...|$|E
