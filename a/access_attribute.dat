The detailed contention information is sampled from a short cycle-accurate simulation, “training ” a high-level statistical regression model of contention. This contention model can then be used in simulation to estimate the impact of shared resource accesses at a high level of abstraction, enabling the designers to explore contention-related performance impacts of design decisions. Using the access attribute-based contention models resulted in speedups of 40 X over cycle-accurate simulation, with average simulation errors of less than 1 % with 95 % confidence intervals of about ± 3 %...|$|R

40|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to tune the performance of modern component-based Internet services because: (1) component middleware are complex software systems that expose several independently tuned server resource management mechanisms; (2) session-oriented client behavior with complex data access patterns makes it hard to predict what impact tuning these mechanisms has on application behavior; and (3) component-based Internet services themselves exhibit complex structural organization with requests of different types having widely ranging execution complexity. In this article we show that exposing and using detailed information about how clients use Internet services enables mechanisms that achieve two interconnected goals: (1) providing improved QoS to the service clients, and (2) optimizing server resource utilization. To differentiate among levels of service usage (service access) information, we introduce the notion of the service <b>access</b> <b>attribute</b> and identify four related groups of service access attributes, encompassing different aspects of service usage information, ranging from the high-level structure of client web sessions to low-level fine-grained information about utilization of server resources by different requests.

Multiple-feature costs have been documented previously, {{but it is not clear}} whether the multiple-feature cost arose at the selection (segregating targets from non-targets) stage predicted by the limited-resource account. The cost might instead result from a post-selection difficulty in processing or accessing the contents of the targets. By defining the targets with a selection attribute (color) that is very distinct from the attribute participants must access and report (spatial period), we were able to manipulate the selection process independently from the access stage. We still found a cost for different selection features (colors), suggesting that multiple-feature costs can arise at the selection stage. The cost was only significant however when distracters were present that shared the selection features. The cost manifested not only as greater errors or less precision in reporting the <b>access</b> <b>attribute</b> (spatial period), but also as an increased temporal lag between the physical stimuli and the reported percept. In summary, splitting selection among different features incurred little or no penalty by itself, but selection interference by distracters sharing target features could be large and could slow processing...|$|E

It is an evaluative and cross-sectional study of quantitative approach. A total of 344 children?s family members in Family Health Units took part in the research. Data collection occurred from October 2012 to January 2013 by using the Primary Care Evaluation Tool, child?s version, and a tool structured for collecting the families? socio-demographic data. Data were analyzed in the light of descriptive statistics, distribution of absolute/relative frequencies, calculation of average and construction of scores for the measured attributes, following the guidance contained in the tool?s manual issued by the Health Ministry. In order to analyze the association among the variables, univariate statistical tests and the adaptation of a logistic regression model were used. The study followed the guidelines of the Resolution number 466 / 12 of the National Council of Health, and obtained favorable opinion of the Research Ethics Committee number 044 / 2012 and CAAE number 01295412. 2. 1001. 0107. High scores for the <b>access</b> <b>attribute</b> were verified in their procedural component, use and longitudinality which highlight that the service is reference for infantile care and it has been used as regular source of care. Longitudinality is favored by the existence of a suitable information system, procedural component of the coordination. Nevertheless, it was observed commitment of the structural dimension of access accessibility, of the integrality attribute in both evaluated dimensions available and offered services, which consequently resulted in the low family and community guidance. From the user?s characteristics associated to the satisfactory evaluation of the service, the affiliation degree was highlighted which was presented as possibility for a better evaluation of the Family Health Strategy. Probably, the bond is the factor related to the satisfactory evaluation once it provides favorable conditions for the offer of measured attributes. This result emphasizes the importance of the bond for the quality of primary care services in the child?s health. It can be concluded that the Family Health Strategy still is not directed to the child?s Primary Health Care in the investigated context, but it focuses on attaining satisfactory levels for the evaluated attributes, highlighting the need for improving aspects of the service process and structure, especially related to the access accessibility and integrality attributes, in addition to the attributes derived from family and community guidance with the purpose of qualifying the developed actions...|$|E

Segundo o referencial teÃrico postulado por Starfield, a APS Ã caracterizada por atributos essenciais: acesso de primeiro contato, longitudinalidade, integralidade e coordenaÃÃo da atenÃÃo; e atributos derivados: orientaÃÃo familiar, orientaÃÃo comunitÃria e competÃncia cultural, os quais devem estar presentes nos serviÃos de saÃde para que realmente este esteja orientado para a APS. A partir da avaliaÃÃo da presenÃa e extensÃo dos atributos essenciais e derivados Ã APS, tÃmse elementos consistentes para identificar as fragilidades do sistema e orientar a organizaÃÃo dos serviÃos de saÃde na produÃÃo do cuidado, em especÃfico neste estudo, ao grupo populacional de zero a 12 anos incompletos. Objetivo: Avaliar o grau de orientaÃÃo da atenÃÃo primÃria Ã saÃde da crianÃa em relaÃÃo Ã extensÃo dos atributos da APS. Metodologia: Trata-se de um estudo quantitativo, do tipo avaliativo. Foram {{realizadas}} 548 entrevistas com cuidadores de crianÃas menores de 12 anos atendidas nas 24 unidades de saÃde da Ãrea urbana do municÃpio de Cascavel- PR. As entrevistas foram conduzidas por instrumento prÃprio denominado Instrumento de AvaliaÃÃo da AtenÃÃo PrimÃria - PCATool - Brasil versÃo crianÃa, bem como, por um instrumento formulado pelo grupo de pesquisa, com relaÃÃo aos aspectos socioeconÃmicos das famÃlias. A coleta de dados ocorreu nos meses de outubro de 2012 e fevereiro de 2013. Os dados foram digitados em um banco de dados criado no programa Excel 2010, com dupla entrada e conferÃncia dos dados para maior confiabilidade, posteriormente enviados para o software SPSS 17. 0, sendo calculado a mÃdia, erro padrÃo, mÃnima e mÃxima. As amostras descritivas foram apresentadas por frequÃncias absolutas e relativas. Para obter o escore essencial da APS, foi calculada a mÃdia geral dos atributos e dividido pelo nÃmero de atributos. Para comparaÃÃo da presenÃa e extensÃo dos atributos utilizou-se como ponto de corte os valores de escores &# 8805; 6, 6, definidos como elevados e valores < 6, 6 considerados baixos/insatisfatÃrios. Resultados: Os dados analisados demonstraram que os serviÃos bÃsicos de saÃde pÃblica do municÃpio de Cascavel-PR, nÃo apresentam orientaÃÃo para a APS, pois os atributos essenciais e derivados nÃo foram reconhecidos em sua extensÃo e totalidade pelos cuidadores das crianÃas que utilizam esses serviÃos. O escore geral da APS foi 6, 3, demonstrando a nÃo orientaÃÃo da APS para a atenÃÃo primÃria Ã crianÃa, contribuindo para a nÃo resolutividade da assistÃncia prestada. O atributo acesso de primeiro contato obteve escore mÃdio satisfatÃrio no processo do cuidado â utilizaÃÃo (8, 6), porÃm, relativo Ã estrutura do cuidado â acessibilidade- o escore 5, 5 aponta fragilidade nesse atributo. O baixo escore da estrutura implica em dificuldades de acesso das crianÃas aos serviÃos, bem como, deficiÃncia de estrutura organizacional e recursos humanos para uma assistÃncia integral e de qualidade voltada Ã saÃde infantil. A longitudinalidade tambÃm apresentou baixo escore (6, 1), apontando dificuldade de interaÃÃo entre os serviÃos e as famÃlias das crianÃas ao longo do tempo, o qual implica em um cuidado fragmentado e pouco resolutivo. Na avaliaÃÃo da integralidade da atenÃÃo, os serviÃos disponÃveis e os serviÃos prestados apresentaram escores mÃdios insatisfatÃrios (6, 0 e 6, 1 respectivamente). Nesse sentido, tem-se a necessidade de ampliaÃÃo dos serviÃos ofertados pela atenÃÃo primÃria para que o cuidado Ã crianÃa possa ser resolutivo nesse ponto da atenÃÃo. Dos atributos essenciais, o Ãnico a apresentar escores satisfatÃrios na estrutura (7, 4) e no processo (6, 9) do cuidado referiu-se Ã coordenaÃÃo da atenÃÃo. Os atributos derivados â orientaÃÃo familiar (4, 4) e orientaÃÃo comunitÃria (5, 1) apresentaram escores aquÃm do considerado satisfatÃrio, nÃo integrando a famÃlia e a comunidade no cuidado Ã crianÃa. ConsideraÃÃes: Percebe-se a dificuldade de orientaÃÃo para a APS nos serviÃos de saÃde avaliados pela falta de total extensÃo dos atributos da APS no cuidado, fortalecendo a cultura de assistÃncia curativa e centrada no indivÃduo. Salienta-se a necessidade de ampliaÃÃo da rede de EstratÃgia SaÃde da FamÃlia no municÃpio, alterando o processo de cuidado e o modelo assistencial, assim como a adoÃÃo de um sistema integrado de serviÃos de saÃde. O fortalecimento da APS pode resultar em melhores condiÃÃes de saÃde da populaÃÃo infantil, tendendo Ã reduÃÃo da morbimortalidade por causas evitÃveisIntroduction: The Primary Health Care (PHC) is {{a strategy}} of organization and reorganization of the health system {{as well as the}} change in clinical care practice, constituting the first level of care. According to the theory postulated by Starfield, PHC is characterized by essential attributes: first contact access, longitudinality, comprehensiveness, and coordination of care, and derived attributes: family counseling, community orientation and cultural competence, which must be present in the service health so that this is really oriented PHC. From the evaluation of the presence and extent of the essential attributes and derived the PHC, have become consistent elements to identify the weaknesses of the system and guide the organization of health care services in production, specifically in this study, the population group zero to 12 years old. Objective: To evaluate the degree of orientation of the primary health care of the child in relation to the extension of the attributes of PHC. Methodology: This is a quantitative study, the evaluative. 548 interviews with caregivers of children younger than 12 years who were treated in 24 health units in the urban area of the city of Cascavel - PR were performed. The interviews were conducted by special act called Assessment Tool Primary - PCATool - Brazil child version, as well as by an instrument made by the research group, in relation to socioeconomic families. Data collection occurred from October 2012 and February 2013. Data were entered into a database created in Excel 2010 program, with double entry and checking of data for greater reliability, then sent to the software SPSS 17. 0, the mean, standard error, minimum and maximum being calculated. Descriptive samples were presented as absolute and relative frequencies. For the bulk of the PHC score, the overall average of the attributes was calculated and divided by the number of attributes. For comparison of the presence and extent of attributes was used as cutoff values &# 8805; 6. 6 scores, defined as high and values < 6. 6 were considered low/unsatisfactory. Results: The data showed that the basic public health services of the city of Cascavel - PR, does not have guidance for PHC because the essential attributes and derivatives were not recognized in their full extent and caregivers of children using these services. The overall score of APS was 6, 3, demonstrating the lack of guidance PHC for primary care to the child, not contributing to solving the healthcare provided. The <b>access</b> <b>attribute</b> of first contact had satisfactory mean score in the care process - using (8, 6), however, on the structure of care - accessibility - score 5. 5 points fragility in this attribute. The low score of the structure implies difficulties in children access to services, as well as deficiency of organizational structure and human resources for comprehensive care and quality focused on child health. The longitudinality also showed low score (6, 1), indicating the difficulty of interaction between services and families of children over time, which implies a fragmented and poorly resolutive care. In the evaluation of integrated care services available and services produced unsatisfactory average scores (6, 0 and 6, 1 respectively). In this sense, {{there is a need to}} expand the services offered by the primary care for the child care may be resolving this point of attention. Essential attributes, the one to submit satisfactory scores on the structure (7, 4) and the process (6, 9) care referred to the coordination of care. Derived attributes - family orientation (4, 4) and community orientation (5, 1) had scores below the satisfactory, non integrating family and community in child care. Considerations: We can see the difficulty of guidance for PHC in health services measured by the lack of full extension of the APS attributes of care, strengthening the culture of curative care and focused on the individual. We emphasize the need for expansion of the Family Health Strategy services in the city, changing the process of care and assistance model, as well as the adoption of an integrated system of health services. Strengthening of PHC can result in better health of the child population, tending to reduce morbidity and mortality from preventable cause...|$|E

In particular, the new model specification will track not just different parcel sizes and <b>access</b> <b>attributes,</b> but also various location externalities (e. g., neighborhood diversity, local amenities, and production externalities emerging from innovation diffusion) that affect agent (household and firm) decisions.

A framework is described that provides a domain mapping for heterogenous policies. A fuzzy-based conversion mechanism determines the degree to which an <b>access</b> control <b>attribute</b> of one (service) policy may safely interoperate with an <b>access</b> control <b>attribute</b> of another (service) policy. The approach is scalable in the sense that it is not necessary to a priori specify every pairwise policy interoperation relationship, rather, where obvious interpretations exist then policy relationships are specified, while other relationships are inferred using the fuzzy mechanism. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.
