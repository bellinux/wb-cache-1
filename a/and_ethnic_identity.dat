The novel features Asian-Canadian characters in these lesbian relationships, incorporating racial <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity</b> into a queer understanding of speculative fiction. Salt Fish Girl engages queer ideas in regards to procreation and bodies, as characters are able to give birth without sperm by eating the durian fruit. It was shortlisted for the James Tiptree Jr. award in 2002.|$|E

Sotomayor has supported, while on the court, the informal liberal bloc of justices when they divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines. During her tenure on the Supreme Court, Sotomayor has been identified with concern for the rights of defendants, calls for reform of the criminal justice system, and making impassioned dissents on issues of race, gender <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity.</b>|$|E

40|$|Images {{and interpretations}} of the past, present, and future of the American racial <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> {{landscape}} are contradictory. Many accounts focus on the increasing diversity that results from immigration and differential natural increase {{as well as the}} proliferation of racial <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> categories in census data. Less {{attention has been paid to}} the formation and erosion of racial <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> produced by intermarriage <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> blending. The framers and custodians of census racial classifications assume a "geographic origins" definition of race and ethnicity, but the "de facto" measures in censuses and social surveys rely on folk categories that vary over time and are influenced by administrative practices and sociopolitical movements. We illustrate these issues through an in-depth examination of the racial <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> reporting by whites, blacks, Asians, and Hispanics in the 2000 census. The emerging pattern, labeled here as the "Americanization" of racial <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities,</b> <b>and</b> most evident for whites and blacks, is of simplified racial identities with little acknowledgment of complex ancestries. National origin is the predominant mode of reporting racial <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> among Asians <b>and</b> Hispanics, especially first-generation immigrants. The future of racial <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> is unknowable, but continued high levels of immigration, intermarriage, and social mobility are likely to blur contemporary divisions and boundaries.

25|$|The ruling {{military}} {{elite of}} the sultanate was exclusive {{to those of}} mamluk background, with rare exceptions. Ethnicity served as a major factor separating the mostly Turkic or Turkicized Mamluk elite from their Arabic-speaking subjects. Ethnic origin was {{a key component of}} an individual mamluk's identity, <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity</b> manifested itself through given names, dress, access to administrative positions and was indicated by a sultan's nisba. The sons of mamluks, known as the awlad al-nas, did not typically hold positions in the military elite and instead, were often part of the civilian administration or the Muslim religious establishment. Among the Bahri sultans and emirs, there existed a degree of pride of their Kipchak Turkish roots, and their non-Kipchak usurpers such as sultans Kitbuqa, Baybars II and Lajin were often de-legitimized in the Bahri-era sources for their non-Kipchak origins. The Mamluk elites of the Burji period were also apparently proud of their Circassian origins.|$|E

In her reading of the constitutionality of the Obama health care law favoring the poor and disabled, she sided with Ginsburg against fellow liberals Breyer and Kagan. In dealing with the Chief Justice, Sotomayor had no difficulty in responding to his statement that [...] "the way to stop {{discrimination on the basis of}} race is to stop discrimination on the basis of race," [...] by stating, [...] "I don't borrow Chief Justice Roberts's description of what color-blindness is... Our society is too complex to use that kind of analysis." [...] In the manufacturer liability case of Williamson v. Mazda, which the court decided unanimously, she wrote a separate concurring opinion. Sotomayor's rapport with her clerks is seen as more formalistic than some of the other justices as she requires detailed and rigorous evaluations of cases she is considering with a table of contents attached. When compared to Kagan directly, one of their colleagues stated, [...] "Neither of them is a shrinking violet". Coyle, in her 2013 book on the Roberts Court stated that: [...] "Both women are more vocal during arguments than the justices whom they succeeded, and they have energized the moderate-liberal side of the bench." ...|$|E
