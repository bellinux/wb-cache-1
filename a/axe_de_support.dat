50|$|Haret’s major {{scientific}} {{contribution was}} made in 1878, in his Ph.D. thesis Sur l’invariabilité <b>des</b> grandes <b>axes</b> <b>des</b> orbites planétaires. At {{the time it was}} known that planets disturb each other’s orbits, thus deviating from the elliptic motion described by Johannes Kepler’s First Law. Pierre Laplace (in 1773) and Joseph Louis Lagrange (in 1776) had already studied the problem, both of them showing that the major axes of the orbits are stable, by using a first degree approximation of the perturbing forces. In 1808 Siméon Denis Poisson had proved that the stability also holds when using second degree approximations. In his thesis, Haret proved by using third degree approximations that the axes are not stable as previously believed, but instead feature a time variability, which he called secular perturbations. This result implies that planetary motion is not absolutely stable. Henri Poincaré considered this result a great surprise and continued Haret’s research, which eventually led him to the creation of chaos theory. Félix Tisserand recommended the extension of Haret's method to other astronomic problems and, much later, in 1955, Jean Meffroy restarted Haret’s research using new techniques.|$|R

However its interpretation is complex for cylindrical supports due to their irregular geometry and the various fracture modes induced. A better analysis of the crushing test, altogether with {{a comparison of the}} results obtained with the three-Point Bending test (3 PB) and an analysis of the defects present within the supports, provide a better interpretation of their crushing strength data. Experimental results show that two different fracture modes appear during the crushing test – one under bending configuration and one under crushing configuration – inducing a large scatter of the data. Moreover, a comparison with the 3 PB test shows that the strength measured in crushing is lower and the scatter of the data is larger than the ones obtained in bending. This is a consequence of a Weibull size effect and of the presence of macro-defects within one type of the tested supports. It is concluded that an analysis of the fracture modes activated during crushing has to be carried out to obtain a correct distribution of the strength data. The presence of macro-defects within the micro-structure of the supports decreases drastically the crushing strength, while their influence on the bending strength is more limited.

40|$|Akaract [...] Z-eontrast imaging of {{crystals}} {{at a major}} {{zone axis}} is accurately described as a convolution of the scanning probe intensity profile with an object function sharply peaked at each atomic column. The object function contains the high-angle scattering cross sections and all dynamical diffraction effects, which manifest simply as a channeling effect for each individual atomic column. The channeling effect can be described entirely using highly localized s-type Bloch states. A tight binding formulation shows clearly that neighboring columns can be considered independently, in which case no proximity effects occur at interfaces, {{and it is possible}} to assemble object functions for interfaces, superlattices or complex unit cells from appropriate isolated string strengths which may be calculated using simpler model unit cells. Channeling effects are always less sensitive to column composition than the high-angle cross sections. Therefore, dynamical corrections to an image are always second order, and a first order intuitive interpretation can be obtained directly from the image, with no a priori assumptions on likely interfacial arrangements. These ideas will be illustrated for superlattices of SimGe n and (YBa 2 Cu 307 _x) m fPrBa 2 Cu 3 OT _ x),.
