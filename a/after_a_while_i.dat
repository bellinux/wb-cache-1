500|$|... "Dog Eat Dog" [...] is a style {{parody of}} the Talking Heads. Described as a [...] "tongue-in-cheek look at office life", the song was {{inspired}} by Yankovic's past experience of working in the mailrooms {{as well as the}} traffic department at Westwood One radio station. He noted, [...] "At first I thought [...] was kinda cool that I had a phone and a desk and a little cubicle to call my own, but <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> felt like my soul had been sucked out of me." [...] The song features a line directly parodying the Talking Heads song [...] "Once In a Lifetime": [...] "Sometimes I tell myself, this is not my beautiful stapler/Sometimes I tell myself this is not my beautiful chair!" [...] This mirrors a similar line in the Talking Heads song: [...] "You may tell yourself, this is not my beautiful house/You may tell yourself, this is not my beautiful wife".|$|E
500|$|While Butcher contributed about a {{third of}} the album's lyrics, most of the music on Loveless was written and {{performed}} by Shields. Shields stated, [...] "I'm actually the only musician on the record except for the Colm song [...]" [...] Shields assumed Butcher's guitarist duties during the recording process; Butcher admitted that she had not minded because she felt she [...] "was never a great guitarist". Bassist Debbie Googe did not perform on the album, though she received a credit on the album sleeve. Googe said, [...] "At the beginning I used to go down [...] most days but <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> began to feel pretty superfluous so I went down less." [...] Butcher explained, [...] "for Kevin to actually translate to Debbie what he had in his head and play it right would have been an agonizing process." [...] "It wasn't collaborative at all", Alan Moulder said of the album's recording. [...] "Kevin had a clear view of what he wanted, but he never explained it." ...|$|E

For a moment I froze {{in front of the}} computer, {{thinking}} about writing a letter of complaint to the company for sending us the wrong font. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> checked the Bembo Italic and I slowly began to realise that the fonts were Bembo. I calmed down enough to recall that the typeface was originally designed for metal type, and most of the specimens and texts I saw were set in metal type in text size. That was why the images of the characters did not overlap. I knew that a metal typeface was cut or designed separately for each size, but a film composition or digital face is a kind of compromise having proportions designed for reduction and enlargement. I was overwhelmed to see the huge gap. Then I looked into the types used in Western offset-litho prints to see the digital Bembo types in use... the types that were originally designed for hot-metal often looked too light and feeble... Bembo Book is more or less what I expected." ...|$|E

500|$|Niffenegger is {{an artist}} {{who teaches at the}} Center for Book and Paper Arts at Columbia College Chicago, where she prepares editions of handpainted books. She {{produced}} some of her earlier works in editions of ten copies, which were sold in art galleries. However, she decided that The Time Traveler's Wife {{would have to be a}} novel: [...] "I got the idea for the title, and when I draw I have this big drawing table covered with brown paper, and I write ideas down on the paper. So I wrote down this title and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> started to think about it. I couldn't think of a way to make it a picture book because still pictures don't represent time very well, so I decided to write a novel." [...] She was intrigued by the title because [...] "it immediately defined two people and their relationship to each other". Niffenegger said that its source was an epigraph to J. B. Priestley's 1964 novel Man and Time: [...] "Clock time is our bank manager, tax collector, police inspector; this inner time is our wife." [...] Drawing her central theme from this image, she says, [...] "Henry is not only married to Clare; he's also married to time." [...] Other authors whom Niffenegger has cited as influencing the book include Richard Powers, David Foster Wallace, Henry James, and Dorothy Sayers.|$|E
2500|$|... "I avoided {{working with}} other people for many years, partly out of paranoia, and partly out of an earnest desire to stand on my own. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>I</b> got tired of {{thinking}} that way, and it just seemed natural to do {{the opposite of what}} I had done before. [...] I like making music with other people. I can still make music by myself too.".|$|E
2500|$|During {{this time}} Adams {{continued}} {{to write and}} submit sketches, though few were accepted. In 1976 his career had a brief improvement when he wrote and performed Unpleasantness at Brodie's Close at the Edinburgh Fringe festival. By Christmas, work had dried up again, and a depressed Adams moved {{to live with his}} mother. The lack of writing work hit him hard and low confidence became a feature of Adams's life; [...] "I have terrible periods of lack of confidence [...] I briefly did therapy, but <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> realised it was like a farmer complaining about the weather. You can't fix the weather– you just have to get on with it".|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{just what}} I've been foreboding!" [...] said Marie; [...] "it's just {{what has been}} preying on my health, from day to day, {{bringing}} me downward to the grave, though nobody regards it. I have seen this, long. St. Clare, you will see, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> that <b>I</b> was right." ...|$|R
60|$|At first, I had to shut some gates after me, and now {{and then}} to stand still while the cattle that were lying in the banked-up pathway arose and blundered down among the grass and reeds. But <b>after</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while</b> <b>I</b> seemed to have the whole flats to myself.|$|R

2500|$|Taj Mahal {{has said}} he prefers to do outdoor performances, saying: [...] "The music was {{designed}} for people to move, and it's a bit difficult after a while to have people sitting like they're watching television. That's why I like to play outdoor festivals-because people will just dance. Theatre audiences need to ask themselves: 'What {{the hell is going}} on? We're asking these musicians to come and perform and then we sit there and draw all the energy out of the air.' That's why <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> need a rest. It's too much of a drain. Often I don't allow that. I just play to the goddess of music-and I know she's dancing." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "That's a funny story. I {{was with}} this fella down in Alices Springs and I'd been {{playing by the}} river. We were walking back when we noticed this mob of blackfellas in a circle about a hundred yards to our right. They motioned me to play without speaking. I sat down and played {{a little bit and}} they started laughing. I'd always had this {{reservation}} about my first encounter with top dog players and I thought they were rubbishing me, but with traditional black people communication always happens very slowly and that's how it was. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> got to understand that they were pleased at seeing it being played by a whitefella with his own spirit. Aboriginal people say I play walla walla didgeridu. very fast, attack style." ...|$|E
2500|$|We heard {{something}} was wrong with my dad during the [...] World Cup. He started feeling unwell and then, out of the blue, we were told he only had a few months to live. It was a huge shock because we've always been a very close family. I missed the first couple of Tests in England that year so I could be at home with him. It was obviously the saddest time of my life but those last weeks were maybe some of the most beautiful. It {{gave me a chance to}} say thank you and goodbye. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> realised how lucky I was to do that. It's far harder if a parent is taken away before you have that time together. So his death put cricket in perspective for me. It's just a game – and a very simple game if you keep your mind straight.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, he did, and mouths too. But {{from the}} beginning, when I was a child, I {{have known that}} he was dangerous, and I have thought that he would pass on and forget me <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> And <b>I</b> could have lived without him. Nay, there have been moments when I thought I could learn to love some one else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you mean," [...] cried Margery, pulling away in high good-humor, [...] "you think it is safer near the shore; but I {{am not going to}} row very far this time, and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while</b> <b>I</b> may pull the boat in and rest for a time before {{starting}} back," [...] and then she rowed on with renewed energy.|$|R
2500|$|Carolyn's second child, Betty Jessop, turned {{eighteen}} in 2007 {{and returned}} to the FLDS. As was acknowledged by both parties, Carolyn had to physically force her to leave the FLDS when she was thirteen. Since returning to the FLDS, Betty has openly disputed the claims in Carolyn's book, particularly those alleging that Merril Jessop was abusive, saying [...] "it just makes me want to laugh." [...] She describes her years outside of the sect as traumatic, explaining that public school was a shock and that the task of caring for her siblings fell to her due to her mother's health problems: [...] "With the responsibility landing on me so hard every morning, I was an emotional wreck, and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>I</b> hardened into a frazzled bundle of nerves." [...] She added, [...] "I was such a representation of everything [...] hated so much. I just couldn't deny what was in my heart -- my belief in my religion and my love for my father and my family. I spent four years , and there is nothing there for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{completing}} the tour for Midnite Vultures (1999), Beck and his fiancée, stylist Leigh Limon, ended their nine-year relationship. Three weeks before Beck's 30th birthday, he discovered Limon {{had been having}} an affair with a member of Los Angeles band Whiskey Biscuit. Beck lapsed into a period of melancholy and introspection, during which he wrote the bleak, acoustic-based tracks on Sea Change. He wrote most of the album's 12 songs in one week, but shelved them. [...] "Songs sit in my head for a while," [...] he told Time in 2002. [...] "I have dozens in there, songs from eight years ago that I've written but never recorded. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>I</b> just sort of decide to record them." [...] Beck also strayed from the songs to keep from talking about his personal life, as well as to focus on music and [...] "not really strew my baggage across the public lobby." [...] Eventually, however, he found the songs speak to an experience (a relationship breakup) that is common, and that it would not seem self-indulgent to record them. In 2001, Beck drifted back to the songs and called his frequent producer, Nigel Godrich.|$|E
2500|$|On {{that same}} episode of Raw Is War, Foley then reverted to his Mankind character, who began wearing an untucked {{shirt with a}} loose necktie and ended his feud with The Undertaker. At King of the Ring, the two competed in the second-ever Hell in a Cell match in June 1998 at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena. Before this match, Foley and Terry Funk were {{discussing}} the previous year's Hell in a Cell (which took place at Badd Blood in October) that featured the Undertaker backdropping and slamming Shawn Michaels onto the chain-link ceiling of the cage. Foley and Funk were brainstorming {{ideas about how to}} top that match when Funk said, laughing, [...] "Maybe you should let him throw you {{off the top of the}} cage", Foley replied: [...] "Yeah," [...] I shot back, [...] "then I could climb back up – and he could throw me off again." [...] Man, that was a good one, and we were having a good time thinking completely ludicrous things to do inside, outside, and on top of the cage. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> got serious and said quietly to Terry, [...] "I think I can do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Carnegie," [...] Isabel said, {{lifting her}} eyes for a moment, [...] "I do think, perhaps--I don't know--but perhaps, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while,</b> <b>I</b> could love you. I like you very much; won't that do for the present? Why are you in such a hurry for an answer? Why can't you give me a week or two to decide in?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I see it has,' he answered. Then {{to himself}} he said: 'She can't {{translate}} herself into language. She is incommunicable; she can't render {{herself to the}} intelligence. So she is alone and a law unto herself: she only wants me to explore me, like a rock-pool, and to bathe in me. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> when <b>I</b> am gone, she will see I was not indispensable....' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> sighed <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> (for <b>I</b> was {{beginning}} to melt), and said how much I longed to be a soldier; on which Nora recurred to her infallible 'Ah! now, would you leave me, then? But, sure, you're not big enough for {{anything more than a}} little drummer.' To which I replied, by swearing that a soldier I would be, and a general too.|$|R
60|$|So, {{perhaps the}} world is wise in {{promising}} us the circus. We believe her at first. But <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>I</b> fear, we grow discouraged.|$|E
60|$|So they {{discussed}} it. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> left them, {{and went on}} to the railway station to get as many morning papers as I could.|$|E

60|$|This goitre {{prevails}} so {{extensively in}} this region, that you seldom see {{a person with}} the neck in a healthy condition. The worst of the matter is, {{that in many cases}} of children it induces idiocy.

60|$|Now, if he {{had handed}} me the rod, and then taken another boat and gone home, perhaps I might have known {{what to do with}} the thing <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> but <b>I</b> must say that at that minute I didn't. I held the rod out over the water and let the flies dangle down into it, but do what I would, they wouldn't sink; there wasn't weight enough on them.|$|R
60|$|All {{that day}} and the next I watched and waited in vain for the coming of Yva, but no Yva appeared. I even {{went as far as}} the sepulchre, but it was as empty as were the two crystal coffins, and <b>after</b> waiting <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> returned. Although I did not say so to Bickley, to me it was evident that Oro, as he had said, was {{determined}} to cut off all communication between us.|$|R

60|$|It was {{impossible}} for me to face Helena; I own I was afraid. The cook kindly went upstairs to see who was in Philip's room. It was the housemaid's turn to look <b>after</b> him for <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> <b>I</b> went instantly to his bedside.|$|R
60|$|But <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> Jack and <b>I</b> {{adjusted}} {{ourselves to}} the change in each other and became very good friends again. It was quite a different friendship from the old, {{but it was very}} pleasant. Yes, it was; I will admit that much.|$|R
