5000|$|Federal {{student loan}} {{interest}} rates are established by Congress and listed in § 20 U.S.C. § 1087E(b). Because the {{interest rates are}} established by Congress, interest rates are a political decision. The federal student loan program currently (2010) runs a multibillion-dollar [...] "negative subsidy", or profit, for the federal government. Loans to graduate and professional students are especially profitable because of high interest rates and low default rates. Some scholars have suggested that federal student loan interest rates should be tailored to particular courses of study and reflect the riskiness of those different courses of study. They have also suggested that the program should be run <b>at</b> <b>cost,</b> <b>or</b> below cost, because of the benefits an educated workforce provides to society—lower burdens on public services, lower health costs, higher wages and tax revenues, lower unemployment.|$|E

Loss leader strategy is commonly used by retailers in order to lead the customers into buying products with higher marked-up prices to produce an increase in profits rather than purchasing the leader product which is sold at a lower cost. When a [...] "featured brand" [...] is priced to be sold at a lower cost, retailers tend not to sell large quantities of the loss leader products and also they tend to purchase less quantities from the supplier as well to prevent loss for the firm. Supermarkets and restaurants are {{an excellent example of}} retail firms that apply the strategy of loss leader.|$|E

40|$|A major {{challenge}} {{in the creation of}} custom-designed products lies in the elicitation of customer needs. As customers are frequently unable to accurately articulate their needs, designers typically create one or several prototypes, which they then present to the customer. This process, which we call collaborative prototyping, allows both parties to anticipate the outcome of the design process. Prototypes have two advantages: They help the customer to evaluate the unknown customized product, and they guide both parties in the search for the ideal product specification. Collaborative prototyping involves two economic agents, with different information structures and different [...] -and potentially conflicting [...] -objective functions. This raises several interesting questions: how many prototypes should be built, who should pay for them, and how should they and the customized product be priced. We show that, depending on the design problem and the market characteristics, the designer should offer prototypes at a profit, <b>at</b> <b>cost,</b> <b>or</b> even for free. prototyping, collaboration, customization, search models, search contracts, design services...|$|E
40|$|The {{accounting}} for fixed assets is, in many cases, a straightforward exercise, but it isn’t always {{so when it}} comes to the issue of intangible fixed assets and recognizing such assets on the balance sheet. IAS 38, In¬tan¬gi¬ble Assets, outlines the accounting re¬quire¬ments for in¬tan¬gi¬ble assets, which are non-mon¬e¬tary assets which are without physical substance and iden¬ti¬fi¬able (either being separable or arising from con¬trac¬tual or other legal rights). In¬tan¬gi¬ble assets meeting the relevant recog¬ni¬tion criteria are initially measured at cost, sub¬se¬quently measured <b>at</b> <b>cost</b> <b>or</b> using the reval¬u¬a¬tion model, and amortized on a sys¬tem¬atic basis over their useful lives (unless the asset has an in¬def¬i¬nite useful life, in which case it is not amortized). In today’s emerging economy of knowledge, even some banks have concluded that “soft” assets (like computer programming know-how and information infrastructure) can be a better credit risk than “hard” assets (like buildings). But how should the “soft assets” be valued? There are arguments that balance sheets ignore certain intangibles, but the reporting issues of trying to recognize them are, in my mind, insurmountable. It appears that the assets that really count are the ones accountants can’t count yet. This paper focuses on the nature, recognition and treatment of intangible assets, according the requirements International Financial reporting Standards.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Pentagon considers defenses to counter attacks from ballistic missiles, both long-range strategic and shorter-range theater missiles, to be critical to U. S. national security. The Air Force is developing a new satellite system, called Space-Based Infrared System-low (SBIRS-low) to expand the military's infrared satellite capabilities for supporting ballistic missile defenses. GAO reviewed the Defense Department's (DOD) efforts to acquire SBIRS-low. Specifically, GAO (1) evaluated the cost, schedule, and performance risks of the current acquisition schedule; (2) evaluated the program's technical risks; and (3) determined whether DOD has assessed alternative approaches to SBIRS-low. GAO found that the Air Force's current SBIRS-low acquisition schedule is of high risk of not delivering the system on time or <b>at</b> <b>cost</b> <b>or</b> with expected performance. SBIRS-low has high technical risks because some critical satellite technologies have been judged immature for the current stage of the program. DOD acquisition policy and procedures require that the cost and mission effectiveness of space systems be assessed relative to alternative terrestrial systems. However, the Air Force has not analyzed or identified terrestrial alternatives to the SBIRS-low system because, according to Air Force Space Command officials, terrestrial alternatives do not exist. Nevertheless, studies on {{various aspects of the}} National Missile Defense system by the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization and other groups have pointed out alternatives to SBIRS-low, such as sea- or land-based radar. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRegarding {{financial}} reporting, {{information about}} performances {{is one of}} the preferred items banking institutions are referring to. Therefore, quantitative and qualitative performance indicators are a significant part of annual reports. Reporting about performances raises some other issues: valuation <b>at</b> <b>cost</b> <b>or</b> at fair value, registration versus disclosure. In the case of the banking industry, the accounting information disclosed is all the more important as this sector is highly regulated. The regulation is based on management and structure ratios whose intended effects are the prevention of bank failures, as informational asymmetry between depositors, banks and borrowers can cause economic panics. Within the framework of international accounting standards, fair value is more and more referred to as a mean of valuation in the process of determining the economic income. Furthermore, the international accounting regulation institutions tend to promote comparable performance indicators while maintaining the quality of the disclosures about segments of an enterprise. Nevertheless, except the standards dealing with earnings per share and segment reporting, of all the present standards of the IASB, none is specifying the contents and the form of the information about performances. The adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 by the banking institutions which decided to use in advance the IAS framework from January 1 st 2001 shows the growing importance of fair value in financial statements. The information strategy aimed at the investors which is developed by a lot of European banking institutions consists in the disclosure of voluntary information such as the determination of the income by the way of fair value. The {{purpose of this paper is}} the presentation of the characteristics of this voluntary information. Studying a sample of nineteen European banking institutions, we developed an exploratory research. This research is based on a contents analysis of the voluntary information disclosed (frequency tests).
