Robot Fry and Robot Leela declare their love for each other, and leave together, leaving human Fry to tell human Leela that he will wait <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> for her. Bender decides he is fed up with constantly partying and begins to vibrate from the buildup of excess energy. The Cyclophage suddenly emerges and attempts to eat Leela. Bender's severe vibrations cause one of his eyes to fall out, and the Cyclophage swallows Bender, believing {{him to be a}} cyclops. The device explodes, killing the creature. Bender emerges intact and the Professor declares that Bender expended his excess energy and is now stable. The crew leave to celebrate, and the episode ends with Zapp Brannigan rapidly emerging from the birth machine.|$|E
25|$|A third wire, {{called the}} bond (or earth) wire, is often {{connected}} between non-current-carrying metal enclosures and earth ground. This conductor provides protection from electric shock due to accidental contact of circuit conductors with the metal chassis of portable appliances and tools. Bonding all non-current-carrying metal parts into one complete system ensures {{there is always}} a low electrical impedance path to ground sufficient to carry any fault current for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> for the system to clear the fault. This low impedance path allows the maximum amount of fault current, causing the overcurrent protection device (breakers, fuses) to trip or burn out as quickly as possible, bringing the electrical system to a safe state. All bond wires are bonded to ground at the main service panel, as is the neutral/identified conductor if present.|$|E
25|$|The {{defensive}} team {{tries to}} stop the attacking team from scoring by tackling the player with the ball {{as quickly as possible}} to prevent him gaining more ground. A tackle forces a halt in play for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> the tackled player to return to his feet and play the ball. In that time, the defending team, with the exception of two markers, must move back a minimum of 10 metres towards their end of the field. The attacking team restarts play and continues with its next chance to score via the play-the-ball. After each tackle the attacking team should be closer to their opposition's end of the field. A 2012 New Zealand study found that over 659 tackles are made per game in professional rugby league. Of all the rugby league positions, second-row forward averages the most tackles.|$|E

The Yemenite Jewish practice, however, follows Rabbi Saadiah Gaon who {{required}} that the meat not be larger than half a [...] "rotal" [...] (i.e. ca. 216 grams) when salting. This allows {{the effects of the}} salt to penetrate. Some Orthodox Jewish communities require the additional stricture of submersing raw meat in boiling water prior to cooking it, a practice known as ḥaliṭah (...) , “blanching.” This was believed to constrict the blood lodged within the meat, to prevent its oozing out when it is eaten. The raw meat is left in the pot of boiling water for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> for the meat to whiten on its outer layer. If someone wanted to use the water for soup after making ḥaliṭah in the same pot, he simply scoops out the film, froth and scum that surface in the boiling water. Ḥaliṭah is not required when roasting meat over a fire, as the fire constricts the blood.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the 2011 Assembly election concerns were raised by politicians and others about {{the time it took}} for ballots to be verified and counted. The first result came in at 7:00p.m. on Friday 6 May, nine hours after counting began and 21 hours after polls closed. The announcement of the final results for some constituencies came two days after the polls closed. In contrast, the first result for elections held in Scotland on the same day as the Assembly election came in at 12:54a.m., just under three hours after counting began, and the final result came in at 5:21p.m. on the same day (Friday 6 May).

2500|$|Shakespeare's sonnet cycle has {{overarching}} {{themes of}} great {{love and the}} passage of time. In this sonnet, the speaker is now concentrating on his own death and how the youth is to mourn him after he is deceased. The speaker tells the youth not to mourn {{for him when he}} is dead, and that the youth should only think about him for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to tell the world of his death. The speaker then tells his beloved youth that if even reading this sonnet will cause him to suffer, he should forget the hand that wrote the poem. Joseph Pequigney writes that the sonnet is a [...] "persuasive appeal to be recalled, loved and lamented…a covert counterthesis". Stephen Booth calls this sonnet [...] "a cosmic caricature of a revenging lover." [...] While many critics agree with Peguiney and Booth, and have said that this sonnet is a veiled attempt {{on the part of the}} speaker to actually invoke the youth to mourn him, some critics believe differently. Helen Vendler writes that [...] "There are also, I believe, sonnets of hapless love--intended as such by the author, expressed as such by the speaker." ...|$|E
2500|$|Swinging {{is a form}} of extradyadic sex where {{married couples}} {{exchange}} partners with each other. Swinging was originally called [...] "wife-swapping" [...] but due to the sexist connotations and the fact that many wives were willing to swap partners, [...] "mate swapping" [...] and or [...] "swinging" [...] was substituted (Hyde, DeLamater, & Byers, 2009). The Supreme Court in Canada has ruled swinging is legal <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> place in a private place and is consensual. Swinging can be closed or open, where couples meet and each pair goes off to a separate room or they have sex in the same room (Hyde, DeLamater, & Byers, 2009). The majority of swingers fall into the middle and upper classes, with an above average education and income, and majority of these swingers are White (90%) (Jenks, 1998). [...] A study done by Jenks in 1986 found that swingers are not significantly different from non-swingers on measures such as philosophy, authoritarianism, self-respect, happiness, freedom, equality etc. [...] Swingers tend to emphasize personal values over more social ones. According to Henshel (1973) the initiation into the world of swinging usually is done by the husband.|$|E

2500|$|According to a 2012 investigative {{piece by}} the Somalia Report, the OBP paper {{and other similar}} reports that attempt to {{calibrate}} the global cost of piracy produce inaccurate estimates based {{on a variety of}} factors. Most saliently, instead of comparing the actual costs of piracy with the considerable benefits derived from the phenomenon by the maritime industry and local parties capitalizing on capacity-building initiatives, the OBP paper conflated the alleged piracy costs with the large premiums made by insurance companies and lumped them together with governmental and societal costs. The report also exaggerated the impact that piracy has had on the shipping sector, an industry which has grown steadily in size from 25,000 billion tonnes/miles to 35,000 billion tonnes/miles since the rise of Indian Ocean piracy in 2005. Moreover, the global costs of piracy reportedly represent a small fraction of total maritime shipping expenses and are significantly lower than more routine costs, such as those brought on by port theft, bad weather conditions or fuel-related issues. In the United States alone, the National Cargo Security Council estimated that between $10–$15 billion were stolen from ports in 2003, a figure several times higher than the projected global cost of piracy. Additionally, while the OBP paper alleged that pirate activity has had a significantly negative impact on regional economies, particularly the Kenyan tourism industry, tourist-derived revenue in Kenya rose by 32% in 2011. According to the Somalia Report investigation, the OBP paper also did not factor into its calculations the overall decline in successful pirate attacks beginning {{in the second half of}} 2011, a downward trend largely brought about by the increasing use of armed guards. According to Admiral Terence E. McKnight, ransom demands and payments have risen exponentially and the financers and pirates decided they are willing to wait <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to receive [...] "high seven-figure payouts".|$|E
2500|$|Coonan's casting as Carl was {{announced}} on 6 May 2013, {{when it was}} revealed that the character is Kirsty Branning's (Kierston Wareing) ex-boyfriend and has been in prison, where he had shared a cell with Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). Coonan said of his casting, [...] "EastEnders {{has been a part of}} my life since I was 12 years old. I even remember talking about the storylines in school playgrounds in Tottenham and I am very happy and proud to now be a small part of its life." [...] Executive producer Lorraine Newman said: [...] "It's wonderful to have Daniel Coonan joining us in Walford to play Carl White. Oozing confidence and with a dangerous edge, will Kirsty be able to resist his bad boy charms for long, or can [...] Max [...] save her from the lure of the dark side?" [...] This is Coonan's second role in EastEnders, as he played David Priors in 2011. Coonan said the four-episode role helped him prepare for a bigger role in the programme, though describing his first day on set as Carl, he said, [...] "it still hits you when you walk on to the Square for the very first time. It's like walking into your TV." [...] Coonan filmed his first scene on the Bridge Street market set. Heat reported that Carl's introduction was part of a [...] "rescue plan" [...] to increase ratings for EastEnders, especially with the announced departures of popular characters Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner), Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) and Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), saying [...] "with ever-dwindling ratings and an unusually bare trophy cabinet, producers have been forced to plan some major shake-ups in an attempt to revive the ailing drama with new characters, returning familiar faces and exciting storylines." [...] Coonan later said of being cast, [...] "When they offered the part of Carl to me, I thought about it <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to blink your eyelids. I knew it would be a great character and fun to play. Something like this can massively raise your profile. I'm beaming into thousands of people's homes four times a week." [...] Coonan was originally contracted to appear in 28 episodes over a six-month period, but instead filmed over 60 episodes. After Danny Dyer was cast as Mick Carter in the show, he revealed that he was approached to play Carl.|$|E
