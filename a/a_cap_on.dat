5|$|Cap {{and trade}} is {{designed}} to reduce the {{effects of climate change}} by setting <b>a</b> <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. The cap will decline approximately three percent each year in 2013. The trading will create incentives to reduce the effects of climate change in California communities by reducing greenhouse gases through investments in clean technologies.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Schiff {{sponsored}} eliminating <b>a</b> <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> taxi licenses in Minneapolis. The move angered {{some local}} taxi drivers, who noted that an attending increase in licenses {{would lead to}} greater competition in the local taxicab business. The City Council passed the cap lift, {{and the number of}} Minneapolis taxis doubled between 2010 and 2012.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the {{increasing}} wealth of middle class merchants and traders meant that commoners began emulating the aristocracy, {{and threatened to}} break {{down some of the}} symbolic barriers between the nobility and the lower classes. The response came in two forms: didactic literature warning of the dangers of adapting a diet inappropriate for one's class, and sumptuary laws that put <b>a</b> <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> the lavishness of commoners' banquets.|$|E
25|$|Cap {{structure}} is sometimes expressed as initial adjustment cap / subsequent adjustment cap / life cap, for example 2/2/5 {{for a loan}} with <b>a</b> 2% <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> the initial adjustment, <b>a</b> 2% <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> subsequent adjustments, and <b>a</b> 5% <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> total interest rate adjustments. When only two values are given, this indicates that the initial change cap and periodic cap are the same. For example, <b>a</b> 2/2/5 <b>cap</b> structure may sometimes be written simply 2/5.|$|R

5|$|Premier League clubs {{agreed in}} {{principle}} in December 2012, to radical new cost controls. The two proposals {{consist of a}} break-even rule and <b>a</b> <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> the amount clubs can increase their wage bill by each season.

5|$|In 1993, the Senators {{would sign}} Daigle to a $12.25 million contract, the largest rookie salary in League history, which {{would lead to}} <b>a</b> <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> rookie {{contracts}} a few years later. The club would promote Daigle over Alexei Yashin, nominating Daigle for {{rookie of the year}} over Yashin. His play did not justify full-time status and in 1995, coaches Rick Bowness and Alain Vigneault demoted Daigle to part-time status. The move led to Bowness and Vigneault being fired. In the end, Daigle did not come close to the career the Senators hoped for. After scoring only 74 goals in just over four seasons, he was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers, and is widely {{regarded as one of the}} biggest draft busts in sports history.|$|E
5|$|Course {{officials}} resumed work by drilling shafts {{into the}} surface to form a well and installed <b>a</b> <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> it {{in an attempt to}} reduce the drainage problem before the start of Friday's scheduled sessions. It was mooted by some British press publications that the race would be moved to the track's infield road course but this could not be achieved because the circuit did not hold a licence from motorsport's world governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, to hold an event on this section, and the teams did not bring a suitable aerodynamic package. Drainage problems continued to affect the track leading to the cancellation of the qualifying session, and the starting order was determined by the drivers order in the points' standings. The pole position was awarded to Bräck, his sixth of the season. He was joined on the grid's front row by de Ferran. Andretti was third, Castroneves fourth and Dixon fifth. Dario Franchitti, Patrick Carpentier, Cristiano da Matta, Roberto Moreno and Tony Kanaan rounded out the top ten. Drying efforts continued overnight with additional equipment and extra workers from across England brought in to help improve the track's drainage. Five jet dryers were taken onto the track with additional fuel transported from Sywell Aerodrome to help the vehicles carry out their operation. Additionally, thousands of small holes were created in the track's surface to release moisture.|$|E

5|$|One {{result of}} the {{economic}} and political tensions was the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, in which widespread rural discontent was followed by an invasion of London involving thousands of rebels. The rebels had many demands, including the effective end of the feudal institution of serfdom and <b>a</b> <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> the levels of rural rents. The ensuing violence took the political classes by surprise and the revolt was not fully put down until the autumn; up to 7,000 rebels were executed in the aftermath. As a {{result of the}} revolt, parliament retreated from the poll tax and instead focused on a system of indirect taxes centring on foreign trade, drawing 80% of tax revenues from the exports of wool. Parliament continued to collect direct tax levies at historically high levels up until 1422, although they reduced them in later years. As a result, successive monarchs found that their tax revenues were uncertain, and HenryVI enjoyed less than half the annual tax revenue of the late 14th century. England's monarchs became increasingly dependent on borrowing and forced loans to meet the gap between taxes and expenditure and even then faced later rebellions over levels of taxation, including the Yorkshire rebellion of 1489 and the Cornish rebellion of 1497 during the reign of HenryVII.|$|E
5|$|When he played, Bates {{stood at}} , {{something}} that teammates taunted him about: in Milwaukee spring training camp, players threw <b>a</b> <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> {{the ground and}} addressed {{it as if it}} were Bates. During the MLB off-season, he worked as a substitute school teacher in Houston. Before the World Series, Bates raced against an unchained cheetah in a promotional event for the Cincinnati Zoo at Riverfront Stadium. The premise of the event was to show that a cheetah could defeat a human (with a five-second head start) in a 100-yard race. The cheetah was supposed to chase a toy, but about halfway through the race, Bates' hat fell off, and instead, it went after the hat; Bates won the race. In 2000, the University of Texas inducted him into their Men's Athletics Hall of Honor. , Bates lives in Houston and works for an equipment supplier in the oil and gas industry. He also coaches his daughter's softball team outside of work.|$|E

It was estimated that this could result in 50,000 unemployed families losing an average of £93 a week. He also announced that he would end the universal entitlement to child benefit, and that from 2013 the entitlement would be removed from people paying the 40% and 50% income tax rates.|$|E
25|$|David Cameron, the Conservative Party {{leader of}} the opposition, set out his {{proposal}} for reform in The Guardian.

Setting out a week by week plan Clegg made wide ranging proposals from placing <b>a</b> <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> individual donations to political parties, to replacing the House of Lords with an elected Senate, to allowing a referendum on electoral reform.|$|E

25|$|As Premier, Rae placed <b>a</b> <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> {{enrollment}} into medical schools. The Rae {{government also}} delisted home care from OHIP coverage but {{introduced a new}} comprehensive program to deliver the service mostly on a non-profit basis by publicly run, regional multi-service agencies and passed the Home Care and Community Services Act, 1994 to facilitate this. The Harris government subsequently rejected this model for a brokerage model in which Community Care Access Centres would hire a home care provider to service a region rather than provide the service directly and lifted the 10% limit {{on the use of}} for-profit service delivery that the Rae government had imposed.|$|E
25|$|During 2009, as Congress debated {{proposals}} {{for health insurance}} reform, Romney {{said that he was}} in favor of increased health insurance portability, coverage of pre-existing medical conditions, <b>a</b> <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> malpractice lawsuits, the implementation of a streamlined electronic medical records system, an emphasis on preventative care, loosening restrictions on importation of prescription drugs, and tax benefits aimed at making health insurance more affordable for the uninsured and targeted to promote universal access. He said he opposed efforts to provide non-emergency health coverage to undocumented immigrants and he supported the Hyde Amendment prohibiting government funding for elective abortion. Romney opposed a federal single-payer system, but supported state efforts to reduce the uninsured population.|$|E
25|$|Jindal {{refused to}} accept federal funds to expand Medicaid {{after the passage of}} the Affordable Care Act, costing his state $1.65 billion in federal health-care {{assistance}} for the poor. He supports increased health insurance portability; laws promoting coverage of pre-existing medical conditions; <b>a</b> <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> malpractice lawsuits; an easing of restrictions on importation of prescription medications; the implementation of a streamlined electronic medical records system; an emphasis on preventative care rather than emergency room care; and tax benefits aimed at making health insurance more affordable for the uninsured and targeted to promote universal access. Since Jindal has taken office, over 11,000 uninsured children {{have been added to the}} State's Children's Health Insurance Program. He opposes a federal government-run, single-payer system, but supports state efforts to reduce the uninsured population. He has also supported expanding services for autistic children, and has promoted a national childhood cancer database. In collaboration with Health Secretary Alan Levine, Jindal has drafted the Louisiana Health First Initiative. This plan focuses on expanding health insurance coverage for the state's indigent population, increasing Medicaid choice, reducing fraud, authorizing funding of a new charity hospital, and increasing transparency in Medicaid by making performance measures available over the internet. Jindal supports co-payments in Medicaid. Due to a congressional reduction in federal Medicaid financing rates, the Jindal administration chose to levy the largest slice of cuts on the network of LSU charity hospitals and clinics, requiring some facilities to close.|$|E
