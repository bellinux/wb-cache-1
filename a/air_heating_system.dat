40|$|The {{building}} {{physical behaviour}} of some typical <b>heating</b> <b>systems</b> for churches {{has been investigated}} by simulation and has been validated by experimentation in situ. In a four-year study the most common church <b>heating</b> <b>systems</b> for large, massive monumental churches have been evaluated. This paper gives an overview {{of some of the}} results obtained for floor heating, local bank <b>heating,</b> hot <b>air</b> <b>systems</b> and gas infrared heating. Relative large airflows due to floor heating and local (bank) heating and thermal draught due to cold walls and glazing have been simulated by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and have been compared with experiments. Contamination due to floor heating has been investigated numerically and experimentally. Hot <b>air</b> <b>heating</b> <b>systems</b> cause large temperature stratification and relative humidity drops and the thermal and hygric effects on monumental organs have been predicted by simulation and have been validated in the laboratory and in situ. The dramatic moisture source effect of 'open air' gas infrared systems on monumental buildings clearly has been predicted and has been proved experimentally. Further more thermal irradiance simulations and thermal and hygric modeling have predicted the thermal irradiance effects, resulting in the drying out of a monumental 16 th century wooden pulpit...|$|R

50|$|The Grade II-listed {{church of}} St John the Baptist {{was built in}} 1870 and {{designed}} by Sir Gilbert Scott or his son. The chancel screen and other furnishings were provided by Temple Moore in 1898-99 and rood beam figures by Lang of Oberammergau. The church's very unusual heating system {{was based on the}} Roman Hypocaust. Warm air came through underfloor ducts from a coke-fired stove beneath the church. Originally the fuel for the stove was carried through a 25-foot brick-lined tunnel on a miniature railway which is still in existence but rarely used.

A hot <b>air</b> <b>heating</b> <b>system,</b> an air conditioning system, restrooms and three meeting rooms named after three former pastors were built.

40|$|TRNSAIR is a {{simulation}} program for solar <b>air</b> <b>heating</b> <b>systems</b> {{based on the}} well known dynamic simulation program TRNSYS. The nomograms in the engineering handbook have been calculated by using TRNSAIR. The program uses the algorithms of TRNSYS in combination with a user friendly interface. The program {{will be available for}} Intel based platforms with operating systems WINDOWS NT and WINDOW 95. The program is capable to simulate 6 generic solar <b>air</b> <b>heating</b> <b>systems</b> in combination with a two zone building model. The user can modify the most relevant parameters of the building and the solar air system. Due to the user friendly interface, it might be used even by persons with less experience in using simulation programs. The program has the capability to describe a building with two thermal zones. Each zone is described by length, width and height. The two zones are linked by one common wall. As default the Task 19 reference building is included. For this building the user can choose three different insulation levels, a light or heavy construction (low or high thermal mass) and office or dwelling building type. Additional large volume building is available (only system 1 and system 2 can be attached to this building type). This choice determines the window and wall, -types, -orientations and areas. The building type is connected to present the regime data of the zones like internal gains, heating schedules occupation and ventilation schedules, or set points for the shading device. Beyond these default settings most of the parameters can be changed by the user. The database is extendable with user defined wall types or regime data. It is also possible to define different values for each zone. The schedules of heating, cooling, ventilation and for the use of shading devices may be controlled by time or by set points (e. g. room temperatures) to model different control strategies. (orig.)

5000|$|The term [...] "unglazed air collector" [...] {{refers to}} a solar <b>air</b> <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> that {{consists}} of a metal absorber without any glass or glazing over top. The {{most common type of}} unglazed collector on the market is the transpired solar collector. The technology has been extensively monitored by these government agencies, and Natural Resources Canada developed the feasibility tool RETScreen™ to model the energy savings from transpired solar collectors. Since that time, several thousand transpired solar collector systems have been installed in a variety of commercial, industrial, institutional, agricultural, and process applications in countries around the world. The technology was originally used primarily in industrial applications such as manufacturing and assembly plants where there were high ventilation requirements, stratified ceiling heat, and often negative pressure in the building. With the increasing drive to install renewable energy systems on buildings, transpired solar collectors are now used across the entire building stock because of high energy production (up to 750 peak thermal Watts/square metre), high solar conversion (up to 90%) and lower capital costs when compared against solar photovoltaic and solar water heating.|$|E

50|$|Built in 1873 by {{industrial}} magnate Alfred Krupp, the 269-room mansion (8100 m2) and {{the surrounding}} park of 28 ha served as the Krupp family's representative seat. The city's land register solely lists the property, which at times had a staff of up to 640 people, as a single-family home. At {{the time of its}} construction, the villa featured some technical novelties and peculiarities, such as a central hot <b>air</b> <b>heating</b> <b>system,</b> own water- and gas works and electric internal and external telegraph- and telephone systems (with a central induction alarm for the staff). The mansion's central clock became the reference clock for the whole Krupp enterprise; every clock was to be set with a maximum difference of half a minute. It even acquired its own railway station, Essen Hügel, which is still a regular stop. The Krupp family had to leave the Gründerzeit mansion in 1945, when it was annexed by the allies. Given back in 1952, Villa Hügel is now seat of the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation (major shareholder of Thyssen-Krupp) and was opened for concerts and sporadic yet high-profile exhibitions.|$|E

40|$|Coupling ground heat {{exchangers}} to heat pumps for {{heating and cooling}} grants significant energy savings compared to the <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> <b>systems,</b> due to the source higher thermal stability and its better thermophysic properties. A coupled system, consisting of an horizontal ground heat exchanger linked to an ideal heat pump for cooling, is examined here. The thermal exchange problem is solved in transient conditions using a numerical finite element model to evaluate the flow and thermal fields within the porous medium. The soil temperature distribution is calculated for an heterogeneous and equivalent homogeneous porous medium, determining {{the differences between the}} two cases in terms of volume, shape and energetic performance. The ground heat exchanger adopted has a specific power between 9 and 14 W/m; the heat exchange is mostly controlled by conduction, even if advection and dispersion phenomena concur in defining the thermal plume. The resulting isothermal lines are very similar between the homogeneous and heterogeneous case, at least in the chosen time frame...|$|R
