5|$|A UTI affects {{parts of}} the urinary system {{including}} the urethra, bladder, and kidneys. There is about a one percent risk of UTIs in boys under two years of <b>age,</b> <b>and</b> the majority of incidents occur {{in the first year}} of life. There is good but not ideal evidence that circumcision of babies reduces the incidence of UTIs in boys under two years of <b>age,</b> <b>and</b> there is fair evidence that the reduction in incidence is by a factor of 310 times (100 circumcisions prevents one UTI). Prevention of UTIs does not justify routine use of the procedure, however. Circumcision is most likely to benefit boys who have a high risk of UTIs due to anatomical defects, and may be used to treat recurrent UTIs.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} the domains of performance needed by leaders in <b>aged</b> <b>and</b> community care not-for-profit organisations. Design/methodology/approach – Focus groups and individual interviews were conducted with senior managers employed by faith-based <b>aged</b> <b>and</b> community care not-for-profit organisations, academics in <b>ageing</b> <b>and</b> business fields and senior government employees from <b>aged</b> services departments <b>and</b> agencies in Australia. Results were content transcribed and analysed thematically in order to identify the major themes that emerged. Findings – A total of 37 people participated in the study. The domains of performance identified by participants as required of leaders in <b>aged</b> <b>and</b> community care were: professionalism; collaboration and teamwork; judgement and decision making; communication; scholarship and teaching; management; advocacy; and leadership. The performance requirements that were identified for leaders in <b>aged</b> <b>and</b> community care not-for-profit organisations were broader than just leadership per se. Research limitations/implications – The findings of this study suggest that the <b>aged</b> <b>and</b> community care not-for-profit sector has specific requirements for the performance of its leaders. Leadership is one of a number of performance attributes desirable in leaders in this sector. Practical implications – The <b>aged</b> <b>and</b> community care not-for-profit sector has distinctive needs and specific requirements of its leaders. Originality/value – It is recommended that a broad range of performance attributes are taken into account by <b>aged</b> <b>and</b> community care not-for-profit organisations when recruiting and training staff in leadership positions...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This {{review is}} aimed at {{describing}} the latest advances made in understanding the pathogenesis of vascular <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> hypertension and their underlying molecular mechanisms. RECENT FINDINGS: p 66 shc and endothelin- 1 are highly implicated in vascular <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> hypertension, respectively. Increased production of reactive oxygen species observed in <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> hypertension may provide the missing link interconnecting endothelin- 1 and p 66 shc. Through several studies performed in animal models and patients, both of these targets {{have been shown to}} be highly implicated, although differently, in the pathogenesis of <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> hypertension. SUMMARY: Future research should be directed toward elucidating a mediator or set of mediators which regulate these targets and which may be the common denominator underlying molecular aspects of vascular <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> hypertension...|$|R

40|$|Ageing is {{accompanied}} by a decline in cognitive functions; along with a variety of neurobiological changes. The association between inflammation <b>and</b> <b>ageing</b> is based on complex molecular and cellular changes that we are only just beginning to understand. The hippocampus is one of the structures more closely related to electrophysiological, structural and morphological changes during ageing. In the present study we examined the effect of normal <b>ageing</b> <b>and</b> LPS-induced inflammation on astroglia-neuron interaction in the rat hippocampus of adult, normal <b>aged</b> <b>and</b> LPS-treated adult rats. Astrocytes were smaller, with thicker and shorter branches and less numerous in CA 1 Str. radiatum of aged rats in comparison to adult and LPS-treated rats. Astrocyte branches infiltrated apoptotic neurons of <b>aged</b> <b>and</b> LPS-treated rats. Cellular debris, which were more numerous in CA 1 of <b>aged</b> <b>and</b> LPS-treated rats, could be found apposed to astrocytes processes and were phagocytated by reactive microglia. Reactive microglia were present in the CA 1 Str. Radiatum, often in association with apoptotic cells. Significant differences were found in the fraction of reactive microglia which was 40 % of total in adult, 33 % in <b>aged</b> <b>and</b> 50 % in LPS-treated rats. Fractalkine (CX 3 CL 1) increased significantly in hippocampus homogenates of <b>aged</b> <b>and</b> LPS-treated rats. The number of CA 1 neurons decreased in aged rats. In the hippocampus of <b>aged</b> <b>and</b> LPS-treated rats astrocytes and microglia may help clearing apoptotic cellular debris possibly through CX 3 CL 1 signalling. Our results indicate that astrocytes and microglia in the hippocampus of <b>aged</b> <b>and</b> LPS-infused rats possibl...|$|R
