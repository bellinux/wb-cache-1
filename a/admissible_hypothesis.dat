And should such an hypothesis eventually be proved to be true, in the only {{way in which it}} can be demonstrated, viz. by observation and experiment upon the existing forms of life, the conclusion will inevitably present itself, that the Palaeozoic Mesozoic, and Cainozoic faunae and florae, taken together, bear somewhat the same proportion to the whole series of living beings which have occupied this globe, as the existing fauna and flora do to them.|$|E
40|$|A crucial {{issue in}} {{designing}} learning machines is {{to select the}} correct model parameters. When the number of available samples is small, theoretical sample-based generalization bounds can prove effective, provided that they are tight and track the validation error correctly. The Maximal Discrepancy approach is a very promising technique for model selection for Support Vector Machines (SVM), and estimates a classifier’s generalization performance by multiple training cycles on random labeled data. This paper presents a general method to compute the generalization bounds for SVMs, {{which is based on}} referring the SVM parameters to an unsupervised solution, and shows that such an approach yields tight bounds and attains effective model selection. When one estimates the generalization error, one uses an unsupervised reference to constrain the complexity of the learning machine, thereby possibly decreasing sharply the number of <b>admissible</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> Although the methodology has a general value, the method described in the paper adopts Vector Quantization (VQ) as a representation paradigm, and introduces a biased regularization approach in bound computation and learning. Experimental results validate the proposed method on complex real-world data sets...|$|E
40|$|AbstractStudying the learnability {{of classes}} of {{recursive}} functions has attracted considerable interest {{for at least}} four decades. Starting with Gold’s (1967) model of learning in the limit, many variations, modifications and extensions have been proposed. These models differ in some of the following: the mode of convergence, the requirements intermediate hypotheses have to fulfill, the set of allowed learning strategies, the source of information available to the learner during the learning process, the set of <b>admissible</b> <b>hypothesis</b> spaces, and the learning goals. A considerable amount of work done in this field has been devoted to the characterization of function classes that can be learned in a given model, the influence of natural, intuitive postulates on the resulting learning power, the incorporation of randomness into the learning process, the complexity of learning, among others. On the occasion of Rolf Wiehagen’s 60 th birthday, the last four decades of research in that area are surveyed, with a special focus on Rolf Wiehagen’s work, which has {{made him one of the}} most influential scientists in the theory of learning recursive functions...|$|E
40|$|The Abruzzi-Molise {{sector in}} the Central Apennines {{is a part of}} a fold and thrust belt that has been {{deforming}} since the Late Cretaceous as a result of collision tectonics between the European and Adriatic plates. The superposition of different deformational styles highly reworked the originally complex palaeogeography of this portion of the southern Tethyan margin. Analogue modelling has been performed on thrusting mechanisms in the Abruzzi-Molise area in order to (1) reduce the number of <b>admissible</b> <b>hypotheses</b> regarding palaeogeographic setting, and (2) define thrusting mechanics. Both of these goals are crucial for hydrocarbon exploration purposes. The sandbox apparatus used to simulate the undeformed passive margin consisted of a thin compartment juxtaposed against a thick one along a linear boundary having variable geometries and mechanical stratigraphy; a rigid but mobile backstop was used to deform the stratigraphy in a Coulomb thrust wedge. Results from six experiments show that the geometric relationships between different structural units depend on the distribution of palaeogeographic domains. These domains are defined by mechanical and/or geometrical parameters, such as the orientation between the maximum compression direction and the palaeogeographic boundary, the mechanical stratigraphy and the thickness of the successions reproduced in the models. The present-day tectonic styles and Meso-Cenozoic palaeogeography of the Abruzzi-Molise area are discussed in terms of the mechanisms and structures analysed through the models...|$|R

40|$|The string {{background}} AdS 7 XS 4 {{is adopted}} {{and the early}} universe is modeled in the eleven dimensional SUGRA theory that is dual to this background. Specifically the ground state of the vacuum is associated with an arbitrary distribution of closed, spin- 2 strings, and excited states are modeled as geometric combinations of individual strings. Combinations or combining iterations are, by <b>hypothesis,</b> <b>admissible</b> or geometric if each iteration intrinsically incorporates the metrical scale that is assigned to the individual spin- 2 string. It is demonstrated that a generalization of this process, if appropriately calibrated, establishes theoretical fer-mionic masses that correspond approximately to observed values.

40|$|Abstract — We {{address the}} mutual {{localization}} {{problem for a}} multi-robot system, {{under the assumption that}} each robot is equipped with a sensor that provides a measure of the relative position of nearby robots without their identity. Anonymity generates a combinatorial ambiguity in the inversion of the measure equations, leading to a multiplicity of <b>admissible</b> relative pose <b>hypotheses.</b> To solve the problem, we propose a two-stage localization system based on MultiReg, an innovative algorithm that computes on-line all the possible relative pose hypotheses, whose output is processed by a data associator and a multiple EKF to isolate and refine the best estimates. The performance of the mutual localization system is analyzed through experiments, proving the effectiveness of the method and, in particular, its robustness with respect to false positives (objects that look like robots) and false negatives (robots that are not detected) of the measure process.

40|$|The NASA Orbital Debris Program Office (ODPO) {{recently}} {{commissioned the}} Meter Class Autonomous Telescope (MCAT) on Ascension Island {{with the primary}} goal of obtaining population statistics of the geosynchronous (GEO) orbital debris environment. To help facilitate this, studies have been conducted using MCAT's known and projected capabilities to estimate the accuracy and timeliness in which it can survey the GEO environment. A simulated GEO debris population is created and sampled at various cadences and run through the Constrained <b>Admissible</b> Region Multi <b>Hypotheses</b> Filter (CAR-MHF). The orbits computed from the results are then compared to the simulated data to assess MCAT's ability to determine accurately the orbits of debris at various sample rates. Additionally, estimates of the rate at which MCAT will be able produce a complete GEO survey are presented using collected weather data and the proposed observation data collection cadence. The specific methods and results are presented here...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} initial orbit determination, or {{catalogue}} maintenance, using {{a set of}} unlabelled observations requires a method of choosing which observation was due to which object. Realities of imperfect sensors mean that the association must {{be made in the}} presence of missed detections, false alarms and previously undetected objects. Data association is not only essential to processing observations, it can also {{be one of the most}} signi cant computational bottlenecks. The constrained <b>admissible</b> region multiple <b>hypothesis</b> lter (CAR-MHF) is an algorithm for initial orbit determination using short-arc, optical (angles only), observations of space objects. CAR-MHF uses joint probabilistic data association (JPDA), a well-established approach to multi-target data association. A recent development in the target tracking literature is the use of graphical models to formulate data association problems. Using an approximate inference algorithm, belief propagation (BP), on the graphical model results in an algorithm that is both computationally e cient and accurate. This paper compares association performance on a set of deep-space objects with CAR-MHF using JPDA and BP. The results of the analysis show that by using the BP algorithm there are signi cant gains in computational load, with negligible loss in accuracy in the calculation of association probabilities.
