As late as 1997, he was still receiving awards for his marksmanship, winning the Outstanding American Handgunner of the Year. Until 2000 {{he served as a}} coach for the Olympic shooting team, able to see without the aid of glasses even at the age of 92.

25|$|Regarded as a profuse {{class of}} minor female divinities, they were {{believed}} to inspire those that drank of their waters. Thus potamides, and nymphs in general, were conceived to be endowed with oracular power, to inspire men with the same prophetic gift, and to bestow upon them the natural talent of poetry. Hence, as water is a necessity to all the creation, the water nymphs, along with the gods Dionysus and Demeter, were also worshipped as providing life <b>and</b> <b>blessings</b> to all existing beings, and this attribute is manifested by a diversity of epithets.|$|E
25|$|Timbuktu's rapid {{economic}} growth in the 13th and 14th centuries drew many scholars from nearby Walata (today in Mauretania), leading up to the city's golden age in the 15th and 16th centuries that proved fertile ground for scholarship of religions, arts and sciences. To the people of Timbuktu, literacy and books were symbols of wealth, power, <b>and</b> <b>blessings</b> and the acquisition of books became a primary concern for scholars. An active trade in books between Timbuktu {{and other parts of the}} Islamic world and emperor Askia Mohammed's strong support led to the writing of thousands of manuscripts.|$|E

25|$|The axis mundi (also cosmic axis, world axis, world pillar, {{center of}} the world, world tree), in certain beliefs and philosophies, is the world center, or the {{connection}} between Heaven and Earth. As the celestial pole and geographic pole, it expresses a point of connection between sky and earth where the four compass directions meet. At this point travel and correspondence is made between higher and lower realms.

25|$|Interestingly, all {{the buzz}} about the Packer affair, which looked such a menace in 78, died down {{within a year}} or so, as the richest man in Australia and the ICC managed to reach an agreement. Yet, the changes {{introduced}} by Packer have not only lasted for a considerable time, in fact, these have continued to produce more changes to the game. Cricket is now fully internationalized, {{and at the same time}} fully commercialized. International stars are now richly paid (and so are the commentators), thanks mainly to the backings <b>and</b> <b>blessings</b> of satellite TV channels.

25|$|New Year; {{the grandest}} of all festivals, and a seven-day holiday period for {{government}} officials.

It was also an opportunity for provincial governors to present their recommended candidates for the imperial examination. Although festival ceremonies in Chang'an were lavish, rural people in the countryside celebrated privately at home with their families in age old traditions, such as drinking a special wine, Killing Ghosts and Reviving Souls wine, that was believed to cure illnesses in the following year.|$|E
25|$|Like the Sum of All Men, the Earth King is {{a legendary}} figure among all cultures. The first human Earth King, for {{there have been}} Earth Kings of many races, was a man named Erden Geboren, who united {{humanity}} using wizardly powers granted {{to him by the}} god-like force of Earth to protect his followers from the Toth and reavers. The Toth were eliminated, but the reavers survived. Geboren's nation was eventually split up after his death, and the royal families of most human nations are directly descended from his most trusted lieutenants and related to Geboren through intermarriage. It has become common for small, homemade dolls and icons of the Earth King to be placed at doorways during Hostenfest, an annual harvest festival, to invite the power <b>and</b> <b>blessings</b> of the Earth King into one's home.|$|E

25|$|According {{to various}} {{historical}} sources, {{a complex and}} cosmopolitan society with a refined culture, deeply influenced by Vajrayana Buddhism, flourished in the Srivijayan capital. The 7th century Talang Tuwo inscription described Buddhist rituals <b>and</b> <b>blessings</b> at the auspicious event of establishing public park. The Kota Kapur Inscription mentions Srivijaya military dominance against Java. These inscriptions were in the Old Malay language, the language used by Srivijaya and also the ancestor of Malay and Indonesian language. Since the 7th century, the Old Malay language {{has been used in}} Nusantara (Malay-Indonesian archipelago), marked by these Srivijayan inscriptions and other inscriptions using old Malay language in the coastal areas of the archipelago, such as those discovered in Java. The trade contact carried by the traders at the time was the main vehicle to spread Malay language, since it was the language used amongst the traders. By then, Malay language become lingua franca and was spoken widely by most people in the archipelago.|$|E
25|$|A second clause {{promotes}} alliance {{by making}} reassurances of aid, most likely military support, if either party is {{attacked by a}} third party or by internal forces of rebellion or insurgency. The other stipulations coincide with Hattušiliš' aims (consult Hittite aims section) in that the Hittite ruler placed great emphasis on establishing legitimacy for his rule: each country swore to the other to extradite political fugitives back to their home country and within the Hittite version of the treaty Ramesses II agreed to provide support to Hattušiliš' successors in order to hold the Hittite throne against dissenters. After {{the conclusion of the}} provision detailing the extradition of emigrants to their land of origin, the two rulers call upon the respective gods of Hatti and Egypt to bear witness to their agreement. The inclusion of the gods is a common feature in major pieces of international law since only a direct appeal to the gods could provide the proper means to guarantee adherence to the treaty. Their noted ability to bestow curses <b>and</b> <b>blessings</b> to people is employed as a serious penalty that would be imposed in case of a violation.|$|E
25|$|Being a hub of {{waterway}} transport, Tuen Mun attracted fishermen {{communities in}} the ancient times. The fishermen wished to enjoy the protection <b>and</b> <b>blessings</b> of the heavenly goddess Tin Hau and built a temple at Hau Kok in Kau Hui to worship her and pray for safety. During the Ming Dynasty, the To clansmen, who were engaged in the salt business, migrated to Tuen Mun. They developed close ties with local fishermen and worked together {{for the expansion of}} the Temple. People living in the walled villages also helped in financing its renovation on a number of occasions. The Temple has always been well patronised by worshippers. During the Tin Hau Festival (i.e. the 23rd day of the third month in the Chinese calendar) every year, villagers and fishermen hold a series of celebrations in the open space in front of the temple. They pray for prosperity and peace by staging thanksgiving opera performances as well as dragon and lion dances. Every year, Lunar New Year fair will be organised in the square in front of Tin Hau Temple. Besides, it is also a place for earthen pot gathering.|$|E

500|$|In a 1998 {{interview}} in Christianity Today, Bong Rin Ro of the Asia Graduate School of Theology {{suggested that the}} growth in popularity of prosperity theology in South Korea reflects a strong [...] "shamanistic influence". Bong pointed to parallels between the tradition of paying shamans for healing and the prosperity theology's contractual doctrine about giving <b>and</b> <b>blessings.</b> Asia's economic problems, he argued, encouraged {{the growth of the}} doctrine in South Korea, though he claims it ignores the poor and needy. During the interview, he stated that he saw the problem beginning to be reversed, citing calls for renewed faith and other practices. Cho Yong-gi, pastor of Yoido Full Gospel Church in Seoul, has been criticized for shamanising Christianity. This criticism has focused on his healing and exorcism ministries and his promise of material blessings. Malaysian Christian writer Hwa Yung has defended Cho's healing and exorcism ministries, arguing that he successfully contextualized the Gospel in a culture where shamanism was still prevalent. However, Hwa criticizes Cho's teaching of earthly blessings for not reflecting a trust in God's daily provision and for their heavy focus on earthly wealth.|$|E

Patricia Uberoi called the film a family film in two ways; it is about family relationships, and it is suitable for the entire family to watch. She said that the film {{is not about the}} two leads, but about the family, an ideal family. Tejaswini Ganti has called the film a [...] "paean to filial duty" [...] for how the children are willing to sacrifice their love for the good of their families. The family relationships are also noted for being different from the normal cinematic families of the time due to their mutual civility. Rediff.com noted that [...] "Though the film was initially dismissed as a wedding video, its success indicated that post-liberalisation, Indian audiences still clung to the comfort of the familiar." [...] Jigna Desai said that the film's popularity was due to interactions of the families around the traditional folk wedding practices. In his study on the response to the film, academic Vamsee Juluri concluded that the celebration of the family is HAHKs [...] "most useful contribution to history".|$|E
