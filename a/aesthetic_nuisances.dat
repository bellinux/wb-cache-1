40|$|An {{estimated}} {{half million}} homes in Minnesota {{are not connected}} to public sewer systems. Along with the growing use oflakeshore cabins and the conversion of cabins into year-round homes, many {{have the potential to}} degrade surface and groundwater resources as they depend primarily on individual sewage treatment systems (ISTSs) for the treatment and dispersal of domestic wastewater. Unfortunately, many are in noncompliance with state standards or are hydraulically failing to the surface. Effective treatment options are needed for the thousands oflocations with restrictive soil and site conditions. Many of these sites occur along lakes and streams, creating a potential health hazard to swimmers and others using surface water for drinking water and recreation, leading to increased algal blooms, <b>aesthetic</b> <b>nuisances</b> and degraded fish habitat. The suspended-growth wastewater treatment process is commonly used by municipal wastewater treatment facilities. This biological treatment process is also available at smaller scales for both individual and multiple home use, and are commonly referred to as aerobic treatment units or ATU's. Since the mid- 1990 's, systems using both the suspended-growth and fixed-film treatment processes were evaluated for single-family home use in northern Minnesota (McCarthy et al., 1997, 1998, 1999; 2001; Henneck et al., 1999, 2001; Axler et al., 1999, 2000; Monson Geerts et al., 2000, 2001; Pundsack et al., 2001). This paper provides an overview of the operation and performance of one brand of aerobic treatment unit and a drip dispersal system tested at the northern Minnesota research facility.

30|$|It is {{estimated}} that 932.5 metric tons of commercial poultry droppings manure are generated in Nigeria annually (Musa et al. 2012). Currently, they are mostly considered to contribute to environmental pollution and <b>aesthetic</b> <b>nuisance</b> and thus discarded in Nigeria.|$|R
40|$|This Article {{advocates a}} wider {{judicial}} recognition of nuisance actions based on aesthetic considerations. Contrary {{to the majority}} of legal opinion to the contrary, it is argued that a right to enjoy property should include a right to be free from non-invasive <b>aesthetic</b> or visual <b>nuisances.</b> With modern real estate appraisal methods making it possible to express community aesthetic preferences in monetary terms, courts are now no longer prevented from using these tools in assessing injuries to real estate. Thus, determinations of <b>aesthetic</b> <b>nuisance</b> actions are not any more subjective than the current task of courts in the context of aural and olfactory nuisance disputes. Indeed, the judiciary should resolve conflicts emanating from the unaesthetic uses of land through the Restatement of Torts “objective” balancing test in order to determine what, according to prevailing community standards, is reasonable under the circumstances. The expanded popularity of aesthetic zoning in many municipalities demonstrates anew the social value of aesthetics and thereby illustrates with clarity a very conscious relationship which exists between economic development and American nuisance law. Judicial recognition of police powers to enforce zoning regulations of this order contradicts - clearly - the heretofore seen reluctance of the Common Law to confront aesthetics in the realm of nuisance and thus invites a more contemporary and enlightened judicial response to this legal issue...|$|R
40|$|In {{the forty}} {{years since the}} passage of the {{original}} Clean Air Act, urban air quality has improved significantly in the United States. Less than a century ago, the vast quantity of coal smoke emitted by urban industries was sufficiently great to obscure the sun, often requiring street lamps in the largest industrial cities to remain lighted throughout the day. Urban residents waged a losing battle against the pervasive dust and ash that entered the home, while downtown merchants labored to keep their merchandise free of soot. More than an <b>aesthetic</b> <b>nuisance,</b> the thick air pollution was directly tied to a range of respiratory illnesses and was believed by civic and religious leaders to be at the root of a societal deterioration in morality (Boyer 1978). Perhaps the most lasting implication of industrial air pollution, however, was its influence on urban development patterns. “Smoke suppressed property values, as clean air became a selling point in the suburbs and dirty air became a reason to flee neighborhoods near city centers” (Stradling 1999, 30). It is perhaps ironic that a century of urban decentralization has not succeeded in providing clean air for the majority of Americans. Many modern air quality problem...|$|R
40|$|This Article investigates {{whether a}} right to {{environmental}} hedonism can be claimed and compensated for when the environment is degraded. Building upon the economic and mathematical uncertainties in assessing any claim for loss of enjoyment of the environment, the Article considers the evaluation of environmental harms ex post through use of restorative damages allowed under the Restatement (Second) of Torts - and concludes {{that because of the}} ambiguities in public policy for not only determining what is an appropriate case for an award of restorative damages but also evaluating the nature and the scope of environmental injuries, these damages are deficient as a tool for protecting environmental degradations. The Article then studies the parens patriae powers of the government to manage and to protect the environment as a source for securing the environment and finds justification for its exercise through the application and use of the Doctrine of Public Trust. It concludes by examining the Common Law of nuisance - and especially anticipatory and <b>aesthetic</b> <b>nuisance</b> - concluding, as such, this body of law provides the strongest remedial base for protecting assaults on the environment...|$|R
40|$|The biosimulator system (activated sludge system) {{have proved}} to be very {{effective}} in the treatment of wastewater containing high content of pesticide and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) in terms of organic load and the quality of effluent being obtained after treatment was acceptable for landscape irrigation and for growing plants of ornamental value for commercial use. The biosimulator can be operated without being an <b>aesthetic</b> <b>nuisance</b> at a considerably low Dissolved Oxygen (DO). The efficiency of the biosimulator at high organic load (pesticide inoculated) and the inoculation of strain of Pseudomonas capable of degrading malathion, could be used to minimize time for treating wastewater containing high content of hazardous pesticide. The principal component analysis exposed the groups of correlated variables and their importance in the data structure. Malin -MalOUT, TMC, MalOUT/MalIN and CODOUT/CODIN were highly correlated with each other and emerged as the variables controlling the first component. DO, pH and retention time governed the second component. The third component of PCA essentially repeated the trend exhibited by the first two components. The presence of pesticides or their metabolites, emphasizes the need for conducting monitoring studies, in order to draw a national picture for overall assessment of the situation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the rise of}} air pollution to become a major public and official concern in America during the 25 years after 1945. What had been largely ignored as a sporadic local smoke nuisance {{was seen as a}} nationwide crisis demanding federal intervention by 1970. Although air pollution was among the most salient issues creating a sense of environmental crisis and facilitating the emergence of environmentalism before Earth Day, 1970, recent environmental history studies have largely overlooked it, focusing instead on traditional conservation and wilderness preservation organizations and often criticizing these for their white, male, affluent, "elitist" character. However, the public-health/antipollution wing of early environmentalism drew broader support from women, minorities, and the working class as well, as citizens mobilized regarding real threats, not mere amenities or linguistic constructs. Air pollution was an issue in England, Continental Europe, and America long before 1945 due to health worries and economic damage, yet local government and industry throughout the industrial world long persisted in constructing the issue as merely an <b>aesthetic</b> <b>nuisance,</b> aided by quietist scientific and medical experts. Even after 1945, when major improvements in science and technology expanded control capabilities and understanding, local and state power structures often still ignored the problem and growing public complaints. Consequently, angry citizens increasingly demanded federal intervention to override state/local nonfeasance, and the federal government gradually responded, creating the (now sometimes criticized) present federal regulatory approach to environmental policy. Three case studies [...] Los Angeles, New York City, and rural central Florida [...] depict wider variations, contrasts and similarities in the national battle against air pollution and illustrate why traditional localism and federalism were unable to adequately address such aspects of the problem as recalcitrant interstate industries, interstate pollution problems, or state/local governments deliberately sheltering polluting industries. This thesis also reflects on other persistent problems and patterns in environmental policy, such as the politicization of science and medicine to serve as weapons in legal battles for economic purposes, or the general public's frequent refusal, even while blasting major industrial polluters, to accept fully their own responsibility for causing environmental degradation...|$|R
40|$|Air {{pollution}} from traffic {{is one of}} the main factors considered in the environmental appraisal of road schemes. Currently this appraisal concentrates on the emission and roadside concentration of those regulated pollutants which are potentially harmful to the health or well-being of human, animal or plant life, or to ecological systems. However, vehicle emissions, especially those from diesel vehicles, may also cause a number of <b>aesthetic</b> and <b>nuisance</b> problems, such as visibility reduction, urban soiling and physical irritation. A methodology to investigate the subjective nuisance effects of air {{pollution from}} road traffic on the public has been developed and tested. The data indicates that vehicle-derived air pollution was an issue of high relative importance to the public when compared to other major social issues. On a local level, the physical presence of road traffic and its associated pollution appeared to be the largest contributors to outdoor public environmental nuisance. Indoors, the public appeared to experience only minor disturbances from vehicle-derived pollution, with the average respondent being not very bothered by vehicle-derived smoke, fumes and odour, dust and dirt and general air pollution. Noise appeared to cause the greatest indoor traffic-related nuisance, although many respondents complained about soiling from dust/dirt. The surveys suggest that outdoor disturbance from vehicle-derived air pollution was fairly high, with smoke, fumes and odour causing the greatest annoyance. The main reason given for disturbance from outdoor smoke, fumes and odour and dust/dirt was concern that they would harm the public's health. Other important specific reasons included soiling and the smell of the fumes. The data also suggests that there can be significant differences in disturbance between sites in the same and different cities, between males and females and between different age groups. No significant differences in annoyance were noted between smokers/non-smokers and different socio-economic groupings. In addition, the level of nuisance experienced by people in urban areas did not depend upon the proximity of their home/workplace to a road. <br/...|$|R
40|$|An {{estimated}} half-billion blackbirds and Starlings {{have been}} roosting in the United States each winter {{for many years}} (Meanley and Webb, 1965). Three-fourths of these birds, primarily Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), Common Grackles (Quiscalus quiscula). Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater), and Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) winter in the east (lower Mississippi Valley and eastward to the Atlantic Ocean) where food and climate are apparently more attractive than in the more arid west. In recent years, these birds have come increasingly to public notice because of appar- ent agricultural, health, <b>aesthetic,</b> and <b>nuisance</b> problems (Graham 1976). Considerable effort has been spent developing lethal agents for local control of problem roosts (Lefebvre and Seubert, 1970). This approach has met with considerable opposition (Russell, 1975; Graham, 1976). Unfortunately, little effort has been directed into ecological studies (e. g., daily habitat utilization, food habits, impact on agriculture) of the various roosting species during the winter months. Such studies are essential to: (1) document the mag- nitude of the problems, and thus, set priorities for additional research, methods develop- ment, and control programs; (2) provide the proper background information for the develop- ment of management tools that offer long-term solutions to the problem; and (3) provide the general public with factual information on blackbird and Starling roosts. Attempts have been and are being made {{to determine the extent}} of the agricultural, ecological, and health problems associated with these roosts. Once enough information is obtained, the public can be informed and management policies can be formulated and implemented. One agricultural problem associated with these roosting populations has been the pulling of sprouting wheat by the birds in late fall and winter. Although high losses have been cited in some cases (Russell, 1975), no objective documentation of the problem is available. Our purposes in this study were to: (1) determine the chronology and amount of bird damage to sprouting wheat in the foraging range of a large roosting population and (2) determine which bird species are responsible for the damage and their abundance in re- lation to other roosting species in this area...|$|R
