50|$|<b>Nuclear</b> fission <b>reactors</b> run on <b>nuclear</b> chain reactions, {{in which}} each nucleus that {{undergoes}} fission releases heat and neutrons. Each neutron may impact another nucleus and cause it to undergo fission. The speed of this neutron affects its probability of causing additional fission, as does the presence of neutron-absorbing material. In particular, slow neutrons are more easily absorbed by fissile nuclei than fast neutrons, so a neutron moderator which slows neutrons will increase the reactivity of <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor.</b> On the other hand, a neutron absorber will decrease the reactivity of <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor.</b> These two mechanisms are used to control the thermal power output of <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor.</b>|$|R
