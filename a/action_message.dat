2500|$|The {{mission of}} the Emergency Rocket Communications System was to provide assured {{communication}} to United States strategic forces {{in the event of}} a nuclear attack. ERCS was basically a rocket or missile that carried a UHF transmitter as a payload instead of a nuclear warhead. [...] In the event of a nuclear attack, ERCS would launch the UHF transmitter into low space to transmit an Emergency <b>Action</b> <b>Message</b> (EAM) to Strategic Air Command units.|$|E
2500|$|Vera always {{accompanied}} the woman agents to the departure airfields, if she possibly could. Those {{who were not}} dropped into France by parachute (as were agents like Andrée Borrel and Lise de Baissac) were flown in on Lysanders, a light monowing transport aircraft designed to land on short and rough fields. These planes were met by a [...] "reception committee" [...] consisting of SOE agents and local French helpers. The reception committee's were alerted to imminent arrival of a plane by a BBC <b>action</b> <b>message</b> inserted as a message personnel; these were broadcast across France every evening, mostly for ordinary listeners wishing to contact friends or family separated by war. The messages broadcast for SOE, agreed in advance between HQ and the circuit organizer, usually by wireless signal, sounded like odd greetings or aphorisms–"Le bibou n'est pas un élephént (The owl is not an elephant)–but the reception committee on the ground would know that the message meant a particular (pre-planned) operation would take place.|$|E

50|$|The United States military's Air Force Satellite Communications (AFSATCOM) is {{a network}} of ground and space systems to allow rapid {{dissemination}} of communications to a worldwide audience. AFSATCOM's creation was {{during the height of}} the Cold War to guarantee that Emergency <b>Action</b> <b>Messages</b> would be received by Strategic Air Command nuclear forces.|$|R
50|$|The Green Pine UHF {{communications}} system {{was designed to}} relay Strategic Air Command (SAC) Emergency <b>Action</b> <b>Messages</b> (EAMs) to SAC aircraft. Green Pine was designed in 1967. Each Green Pine station was equipped {{with a variety of}} {{communications system}}s, to ensure that nuclear command and control messages would reach nuclear strategic bombers in Northern latitudes.|$|R

50|$|At {{a higher}} level, the RTMP encapsulates MP3 or AAC audio and FLV1 video {{multimedia}} streams, {{and can make}} remote procedure calls (RPCs) using the <b>Action</b> <b>Message</b> Format. Any RPC services required are made asynchronously, using a single client/server request/response model, such that real-time communication is not required.|$|E
50|$|<b>Action</b> <b>Message</b> Format (AMF) is {{a binary}} format used to {{serialize}} object graphs such as ActionScript objects and XML, or send messages between an Adobe Flash client and a remote service, usually a Flash Media Server or third party alternatives. The Actionscript 3 language provides classes for encoding and decoding from the AMF format.|$|E
50|$|Previously {{available}} only {{as part of}} Adobe LiveCycle Data Services ES, on December 13, 2007 Adobe announced that the technologies included in BlazeDS, along with the <b>Action</b> <b>Message</b> Format specification, were contributed to open source under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL v3) with the source code being available for download from early 2008. BlazeDS can be downloaded from the official page.|$|E
50|$|Emergency War Orders (EWO) are a {{shift in}} the {{standard}} operating procedure of the United States Armed Forces from a peacetime to wartime contingency. Emergency War Orders are activated after a devastating or sneak attack against U.S. forces, requiring swift action for remaining military units to avoid further destruction. Emergency War Orders are normally transmitted in Emergency <b>Action</b> <b>Messages.</b>|$|R
50|$|One {{common use}} for the HFGCS is to place {{telephone}} calls from the aircraft in flight {{by means of the}} Defense Switched Network (DSN) to an Air Force base to obtain local weather conditions, to arrange for refueling, and to inform the base of the number of passengers and crew. The HFGCS also carries Emergency <b>Action</b> <b>Messages.</b>|$|R
50|$|The primary {{communications}} path is via the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) III (U) satellite. There {{are nine}} of these satellites currently in orbit, each one providing six {{super high frequency}} encrypted data and voice channels and a single channel dedicated for Emergency <b>Action</b> <b>Messages</b> which {{would be used to}} direct a nuclear release from the motorcade.|$|R
50|$|SLFCS {{was used}} for United States nuclear forces' command and control {{communications}} for Emergency <b>Action</b> <b>Message</b> dissemination and force direction. Single channel, receive only capability was provided at ICBM launch control centers. The single channel operated between 14 kHz and 60 kHz to receive commands from remotely located Combat Operations Center - Transmit/Receive (T/R) sites; this low frequency range is only slightly affected by nuclear blasts.|$|E

5000|$|AMF: Flash Player allows {{application}} {{data to be}} stored on users computers, {{in the form of}} Local Shared Objects, the Flash equivalent to browser cookies. Flash Player can also natively read and write files in the <b>Action</b> <b>Message</b> Format, the default data format for Local Shared Objects. Since the AMF format specification is published, data can be transferred to and from Flash applications using AMF datasets instead of JSON or XML, reducing the need for parsing and validating such data.|$|E

50|$|The senior NMCC officer directs {{preparation}} of the launch order {{in the form of}} an Emergency War Order (EWO) - a message that contains the chosen war plan, time to launch, authentication codes and codes needed to unlock the missiles before firing them. A second officer will validate that order. The order is then broadcast to each worldwide command and directly to launch crews by releasing an Emergency <b>Action</b> <b>Message</b> (EAM) which is an encoded and encrypted message about 150 characters long.|$|E
50|$|Local shared objects contain {{data stored}} by {{individual}} websites. Data {{is stored in}} the <b>Action</b> <b>Message</b> Format. With the default settings, the Flash Player does not seek the user's permission to store local shared objects on the hard disk. By default, a SWF application running in Flash Player from version 9 to 11 (as of Sept 1, 2011) may store up to 100 kB of data to the user's hard drive. If the application attempts to store more, a dialog asks the user whether to allow or deny the request.|$|E
5000|$|During {{their initial}} days at sea tension between Ramsey and Hunter becomes {{apparent}} {{due to a}} clash of personalities: Hunter's more analytical, cautious approach, as opposed to Ramsey's more impulsive and intuitive approach. The Alabama eventually receives an Emergency <b>Action</b> <b>Message,</b> ordering the launch of ten of its missiles against the Russian nuclear installation, based on satellite information that the Russians' missiles are being fuelled. Before the Alabama can launch its missiles, a second radio message begins to be received, but is cut off by the attack of a Russian [...] loyal to Radchenko.|$|E

5000|$|DCA assumed {{responsibility}} for the Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN), a subsystem of WWMCCS, in December 1971. The MEECN was developed to assure the timely receipt of emergency <b>action</b> <b>messages</b> by worldwide U.S. nuclear forces under nuclear attack by the Soviet Union. DCA served as the MEECN system engineer and provided the broad engineering necessary to ensure a more survivable future network with compatible, interoperable, and secure subsystems.|$|R
50|$|In the U.S. military's {{strategic}} nuclear weapon nuclear command and control (NC2) system, an Emergency <b>Action</b> <b>Message</b> (EAM) is a preformatted message that directs nuclear-capable forces to execute specific Major Attack Options (MAOs) or Limited Attack Options (LAOs) in a nuclear war. Individual countries or specific regions may be included or withheld in the EAM, as specified in the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP). The SIOP was updated annually until February 2003, when it was replaced by Operations Plan (OPLAN) 8044. Since July 2012, the US nuclear war plan has been OPLAN 8010-12, Strategic Deterrence and Force Employment.|$|E
50|$|Adobe Media Server is a hub. Flash based {{applications}} {{connect to}} the hub using Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP). The server can send and receive data {{to and from the}} connected users with live web FLV player installed. Connected clients can make Remote procedure calls (RPC) on the server-side and the server can call methods on specific clients. A SharedObject can be used to synchronize complicated data structures and call remote methods on multiple clients in one go by having clients subscribe to a shared object. Standard ActionScript objects are transported across the NetConnection using the <b>Action</b> <b>Message</b> Format (AMF) which is handled transparently by the server and flash client.|$|E
50|$|On May 1, 2008, Adobe {{announced}} the Open Screen Project, {{with the intent}} of providing a consistent application interface across devices such as personal computers, mobile devices, and consumer electronics. When the project was announced, seven goals were outlined: the abolition of licensing fees for Adobe Flash Player and Adobe Integrated Runtime, the removal of restrictions {{on the use of the}} Shockwave Flash (SWF) and Flash Video (FLV) file formats, the publishing of application programming interfaces for porting Flash to new devices, and the publishing of The Flash Cast protocol and <b>Action</b> <b>Message</b> Format (AMF), which let Flash applications receive information from remote databases.|$|E
5000|$|Flash Override (Y): The National Command Authority (usually the President of the United States) {{has access}} to a FLASH OVERRIDE (FO) capability. FO is not a precedence, but instead {{represents}} the authority and means to override all other traffic, including FLASH precedence messages. In written message traffic, the proword 'Y' is used to indicate a message having the authority to override all other traffic and is usually assigned to Emergency <b>Action</b> <b>Messages</b> (EAM).|$|R
50|$|To {{build an}} interface, a {{developer}} simply drags interface {{objects from the}} palette onto a window or menu. <b>Actions</b> (<b>messages)</b> which the objects can emit are connected to targets in the application's code and outlets (pointers) declared in the application's code are connected to specific objects. In this way all initialization is done before runtime, both improving performance and streamlining the development process. When Interface Builder was a standalone application, interface designers could ship nib files to developers, who would then drop them into their projects.|$|R
5000|$|This {{center is}} not {{directly}} necessary to initiate a nuclear attack, but it essentially serves as a communications/operations center for nearby Washington, D.C., {{particularly with regard to}} maintaining the American end of the famous U.S.-Russia hotline (the so-called [...] "red telephone"). It coordinated the response to events such as the September 11 attacks, the attack on the , and Payne Stewart's plane crash. The NMCC is responsible for generating Emergency <b>Action</b> <b>Messages</b> (EAMs) to launch control centers, nuclear submarines, recon aircraft, and battlefield commanders worldwide.|$|R
