Pyrethrum {{also has an}} <b>allergenic</b> <b>effect</b> that {{commercial}} pyrethroids don't have.In mammals, toxic exposure to pyrethrum can lead to tongue and lip numbness, drooling, lethargy, muscle tremors, respiratory failure, vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, paralysis, and death. Unlike dogs, cats lack a liver enzyme that allows for glucuronidation that allows for metabolism of pyrethrin compounds. Exposure to even low doses may lead to toxicity in some cats.Exposure to pyrethrum in high levels in humans may cause symptoms such as asthmatic breathing, sneezing, nasal stuffiness, headache, nausea, loss of coordination, tremors, convulsions, facial flushing, and swelling. A possibility of damage to the immune system exists {{that leads to a}} worsening of allergies following toxicity. Infants are unable to resourcefully break down pyrethrum due to the ease of skin penetration, causing similar symptoms as adults, but with an increased risk of death.|$|E

ER UP- 666 - 4 is a non toxic substances - LD 50 per oral is above 5000 mg/kg by parameters of acute toxicity. The threshold of a single inhalation influence (LIMac) is at the level 58, 0 ± 2, 3 mg/m 3 (by EEG). Under chronic inhalation influence of volatile components ER UP- 666 - 4, concentration at the level 1, 35 ± 0, 05 mg/m 3 (by EChG) is the threshold of chronic influence (LIMchr) by <b>allergenic</b> <b>effect.</b> High concentrations of volatile components UP- 666 - 4 have general toxic, mutagenic, <b>allergenic</b> <b>effect</b> which caused the development of glomerulonephritis.

40|$|Background Sensitivity to Alternaria allergens {{has been}} {{associated}} with severe asthma and life-threatening exacerbations, and a high prevalence of Alternaria sensitivity has been reported among inner-city populations. Traditionally, epidemiologic studies have measured indoor Alternaria concentrations by cultural analyses; however, the number of viable spores may not be a good proxy for allergen levels. Furthermore, other genera share epitopes with Alternaria that may contribute to the <b>allergenic</b> <b>effect.</b> Objective To compare measures of Alternaria antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with measures of Alternaria and cross-reactive genera (Ulocladium, Curvularia, Epicoccum, and Stemphylium) by cultural analysis. Method Antigen assays and cultural analyses were performed on vacuum-collected bed dust samples collected between June 18, 2002, and February 9, 2004, from 3 inner-city, low-income public housing developments. Results Alternaria antigen was found in all bed dust samples regardless of season. However, culturable Alternaria, Ulocladium, Curvularia, Epicoccum, and Stemphylium were only found in 50 %, 35 %, 6 %, 11 %, and 0 % of bed samples, respectively. No correlations were found between Alternaria antigen and culturable concentrations of Alternaria or of its cross-reactive genera except for marginal correlation with Ulocladium culturable concentrations. Conclusions The results confirm that exposure to Alternaria antigens and allergens can occur {{even in the absence of}} culturable Alternaria or its cross-reactive genera, so further refinement and use of assays are essential for characterizing the distribution and determinants of indoor fungal allergen levels for sensitive populations...|$|E
40|$|Chemicals in our {{environment}} {{with which we}} have repeated skin contact can cause skin sensitisation (contact allergy). To trigger an immune response a compound (hapten) {{must be able to}} penetrate the skin, where it needs to be reactive enough to bind to proteins and form immunogenic complexes that are recognised as foreign. Electrophilicity has been identified as an important characteristic, which enables haptens to react with nucleophilic amino acids in proteins. In this thesis, a specific type of electrophiles, epoxides, have been investigated. Skin sensitising potencies related to physicochemical parameters have been investigated using structure-activity relationship (SAR) data. Studies on the formation of epoxides by abiotic (air oxidation) and biotic (metabolically in skin) activation from unsaturated compounds and the impact on the sensitising potency of such compounds were also performed. Cinnamic alcohol, a fragrance and flavouring compound, is a well-known contact allergen. However, it lacks the necessary structural alerts to function as a hapten and must be activated to be able to act as a sensitiser. In this thesis, cinnamic alcohol was used to study the formation of allergenic oxidation products (i. e. epoxides) by air exposure and metabolically. The autoxidation study was performed to gain knowledge regarding stability of cinnamic alcohol upon air exposure, oxidation products and sensitising potencies. The sensitising potency (as examined by the murine local lymph node assay) of cinnamic alcohol after two weeks of air exposure was enhanced about four-fold. Two strongly sensitising compounds, epoxy cinnamic alcohol and cinnamic aldehyde, were detected in the formed oxidation mixture. Thus, for the first time, it was shown that cinnamic alcohol acts as a prehapten. The bioactivation of cinnamic alcohol, using human liver microsomes, resulted in the same oxidation products although the mechanism for their formation is completely different. In addition, epoxy cinnamic aldehyde was detected. Most likely, the two epoxides and cinnamic aldehyde are all contributing to the sensitising potency of cinnamic alcohol whether they are formed outside the skin or in the skin. Up to now, the contact <b>allergenic</b> <b>effect</b> seen from cinnamic alcohol has only been associated with cinnamic aldehyde formed as a metabolite from cinnamic alcohol. The present findings shed new light on the mechanism behind the <b>allergenic</b> <b>effect</b> of cinnamic alcohol and offer explanations to the many clinical cases of contact allergy to cinnamic alcohol not reacting to the aldehyde. Terminal epoxides are known contact sensitisers present in compounds used in epoxy resin systems (ERS). The most commonly used epoxy resin monomer (ERM), diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA), is causing high rates of occupational contact allergy. Thus, it would be highly advantageous to replace this strongly sensitising compound with less hazardous alternatives, since even a single accidental exposure may induce primary sensitisation to ERM. In this thesis, specially-designed analogues of phenyl glycidyl ether (PGE) and DGEBA, with terminal epoxides intact, were investigated. The results reveal that the design of series of well-defined compounds can give important insights into the SARs thereof and increased knowledge about the structural basis for sensitisation potential. It has been demonstrated, for the first time, how the chemical reactivity and the sensitising potency of terminal epoxides vary with the overall structure of the compound. Using this knowledge regarding SARs of terminal epoxides novel epoxy resin monomers with reduced sensitising potency were achieved for the first time without compromising the technical properties. By modifying the intrinsic reactivity of ERMs, the fundamental and underlying causes of contact allergy to ERS have been addressed. Using these modified analogues with reduced sensitising potency, in addition to regulations and protective clothing, would reduce occupational contact allergy in the future...|$|E

50|$|In grass pollens, {{the major}} allergens (group-1 allergens, main causative agents of hay fever and of {{seasonal}} asthma) are structurally {{linked to a}} sub-group of the β-expansins.

40|$|The {{involvement}} of the nitric oxide (NO) pathway in ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) has been investigated, in vitro and in vivo, in a ciguatoxin (CTX) /mouse model. The induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) synthesis at the mRNA level was kinetically measured using a real-time PCR protocol based on the LightCycler® technology. CTX-pulsed Neuro- 2 a cells (1 ng/mL) and {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} from CTXinjected mice (1 ng/g), were demonstrated to express iNOS in a time-dependent manner. This strongly suggests that NO might be responsible for certain ciguatera symptoms (e. g. hypotension, <b>allergenic</b> <b>effects</b> and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) which could not be solely explained by the activation of voltage-gated sodium channels. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the most currently used drugs for the treatment of CFP are free radical scavengers.

The first is a newly developed poly(l-lactide-co-glycolide), (PLGA), and the second is a blend of PLGA with synthetic poly([R,S]- 3 -hydroxybutyrate) (PLGA/PHB). The implant prototypes comprise PLGA or PLGA/PHB nonwoven fabrics with designed pore structures to create the best conditions for cell proliferation. The bioactivity of the proposed implants was enhanced by introducing a hydroxyapatite material and a biologically active agent, namely, growth factor IGF 1, encapsulated in calcium alginate microspheres. To assess the biocompatibility and bioactivity, allergenic tests and an assessment of the local reaction of bone tissue after implantation were performed.

The effects of inserting substituents on the BQ ring has not been studied in animal assays. However, mandated reduction/elimination of animals used in cosmetics testing in Europe has led to an increased need for alternatives for the prediction of skin sensitization potential. Electron withdrawing and electron donating substituents on BQ were assessed for effects on BQ reactivity toward nitrobenzene thiol (NBT). The NBT binding studies demonstrated that addition of EWG to BQ as exemplified by the chlorine substituted BQDs increased reactivity while addition of EDG as in the methyl substituted BQDs reduced reactivity. BQ and BQD skin allerginicity was evaluated in the murine local lymph node assay (LLNA). BQD with electron withdrawing groups had the highest chemical potency followed by unsubstituted BQ and the least potent were the BQD with electron donating groups.

We examined 410 teenag-ers who permanently lived in industrial cities in Irkutsk region. We studied individual load as per formaldehyde and nitrogen dioxide. We estimated eosinophils content in nasal mucus and determined indexes of leucocytes migration inhibition to for-maldehyde.

40|$|Background: The paper {{presents}} {{the incidence of}} occupational diseases in Poland (2013). Material and Methods: Occupational disease reporting forms, supplied to the Central Register of Occupational Diseases, were used as the study material. The incidence was specified in terms of rates per 100 000 employed people. Results: The number of new cases was 2214 with the incidence rate of 15. 6. The downward trend recorded over several years continues; compared to 2012, {{the number of new}} cases decreased by 7. 8 %. Exposure to dusts (35 % cases), mostly inorganic (carbon, asbestos, and industrial dusts containing free crystalline silica) was {{the most common cause of}} occupational diseases. Among the organic dusts <b>allergenic</b> <b>effects</b> of flour and vegetable dusts predominated. Every 3 rd case of occupational disease was attributable to physical agents, mainly the way the work is done, excessive vocal effort and noise. The sections of national economy with the highest incidence comprised mining and quarrying (271. 1), manufacturing (24. 3), education (22. 4), agriculture, forestry, hunting and fishing (21. 0), human health and social assistance (20. 5). Conclusions: The decreased incidence of ‘traditional’ diseases observed over the recent 15 years and the analysis of the 2013 incidence indicate a need to revise the Polish list of occupational diseases by exposures found in the modern work environment. Particular attention should be paid to conditions prevailing in workplaces with high exposures to industrial dusts containing free crystalline silica. A considerable variation in the incidence of voice disorders in teachers between individual voivodeships (provinces) points to the need for harmonization of the standards of preventive, diagnostic and certification procedures.

This study was thus aimed at characterizing the enzymatic action of crude extracts of said plant after preliminary purification by salting out with ammonium sulfate at two different concentration levels, viz. 30 % and 70 % saturation. The coagulant activity on milk, and the proteolytic activity using casein and azocasein as substrates, of the crude extract and of each precipitated fraction were measured at 37 °C and pH 5. 2. The profile of hydrolysis of the major whey proteins, i. e. α-lactalbumin (α-La), β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was characterized by gel permeation chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) {{in the presence of}} sodium dodecyl sulfate. The 30 % and 70 % saturation fractions exhibited lower coagulant and proteolytic specific activities than the crude extract. However, the relative ratio of coagulant to proteolytic activity, which is a useful indicator of appropriateness for cheesemaking, was higher for the partially purified fractions. The extents of hydrolysis of whey proteins brought about by the partially purified extracts were above those by their crude counterpart, but qualitative hydrolysis patterns were essentially identical to each other; by 24 h, α-La was substantially depleted, whereas β-Lg was very poorly hydrolyzed and BSA was only slightly hydrolyzed.

Platinum group elements (PGEs) are continuously released from VECs and {{the concentrations of}} these metals in the environment have increased significantly {{in the last two}} decades. The VEC-emitted PGEs can interact with different kinds of compounds present in the environment and be transformed into soluble species able to enter the food chain. This study of the speciation and bioavailability of PGEs examines the behavior of these metals in the environment and their potential to affect human health. The speciation of platinum, palladium and rhodium in the presence of inorganic ligands commonly found in the environment and also acetic and oxalic acids (analogues of the most commonly postulated binding sites on humic substances) was investigated through thermodynamic modelling and solubility experiments combined with mathematical modelling, respectively. All of the ligands studied were capable of mobilizing the PGEs as soluble complexes that can be transported easily in environmental and biological systems. In order to evaluate the potential pathways of PGEs from VECs into humans, physiologically-based tests were used to study the uptake of platinum, palladium and rhodium from road dust, powdered exhaust catalyst and metal hydroxide samples by the human respiratory and digestive tracts. PGEs in road dust samples were found to be highly bioavailable (up to 87 %). The greatest PGE bioavailabilities were observed in lung solutions analogous to the fluid with which inhaled particles would come into contact after phagocytosis by cells.

40|$|Public {{discourse}} on genetically modified (GM) foods tends {{to focus on}} those aspects of recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology that heighten concerns about the potential risks of GM foods. Despite this focus of concern, {{a wide range of}} GM foods exist, including those that are modified by conventional approaches, the safety of which has not been assessed in detail. Also in contention is the likelihood of unintended effects with adverse health consequences in foods derived from crops genetically modified by more modern techniques such as rDNA, compared to those derived from crops modified by conventional techniques. Divergent views exist regarding the methods by which unintended effects should be detected and monitored. With advances in genomic technology, boundaries between conventional and modern approaches to genetic modification may become blurred. There is the need for a reliable method to efficiently differentiate GM foods that require more extensive testing and regulatory oversight from those that do not, regardless of the method of modification. I propose a risk-based classification scheme (RBCS) to differentiate foods derived from GM crops based on levels of concern reflecting their potential to produce human health risks. Two categories of health effects are included in the scheme: (1) the potential for toxic/antinutritional effects, and (2) the potential for <b>allergenic</b> <b>effects.</b> To differentiate the sources of uncertainty about GM food risks, intended and unintended changes are classified separately with respect to potential toxic/antinutritional effects. Factors that may affect the level of risk are identified for each category of adverse health effects. Criteria for differentiating potential health risks are developed for each factor. The extent to which each factor satisfies the applicable criteria is rated separately. A concern level for each category of health effects is then determined by aggregating the ratings for the respective factors. This thesis describes the factors, criteria, and aggregation rules used in determining concern levels in the proposed RBCS and the process used in its development. An exploratory evaluation of selected functional aspects of the scheme is provided. The implications of the classification scheme for the graded testing of GM foods are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Diesel {{engine exhaust}} {{is a complex}} mixture of gaseous and {{particulate}} compounds produced during the combustion of diesel fuels. The gas phase includes carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides (NOX), carbon monoxide and small amounts of sulphur dioxide and various organic compounds. Diesel exhaust particles (DEP) contain elemental carbon (EC), organic compounds, sulphates, nitrates and trace amounts of metals and other elements. New technology diesel engines are characterised by a significant reduction of the DEP mass emissions. Occupational exposure to diesel exhaust occurs in mining, construction work, professional driving, agri-culture and other activities where diesel-powered vehicles and tools are applied. The critical health effects of diesel exhaust {{are considered to be}} pulmonary inflammation and lung cancer. For older technology diesel engines, pulmonary inflammatory responses were observed in human volunteers after single exposure at 100 µg DEP/m 3 (~ 75 µg EC/m 3), and in rats after long-term exposure at 210 µg DEP/m 3 (~ 160 µg EC/m 3). Development of lung tumours was seen in rats at 2 200 µg DEP/m 3 (~ 1 650 µg EC/m 3). For new technology diesel engines, pulmonary inflammatory changes were reported in rats after 13 and 130 weeks of exposure at 3. 6 and 4. 2 ppm NO 2 (12 – 13 µg DEP/m 3, ~ 3 µg EC/m 3). The effect was absent at 0. 9 – 1. 0 ppm NO 2 (4 – 5 µg DEP/m 3, ~ 1 µg EC/m 3). No indication of tumour development was detected. Epidemiological studies associate occupational exposure to exhaust from older technology diesel engines with increased lung cancer risk. Based on a log-linear meta-regression model, 45 years of occupational exposure to diesel exhaust at 1, 10 and 25 µg EC/m 3 was estimated to result in 17, 200 and 689 extra lung cancer deaths per 10 000 individuals, respectively, by the age of 80 years. Although data allowing a direct comparison of the carcinogenic potential of exhaust from new and older technology diesel engines are not available, the significant reduction of the DEP mass concentration in the new technology diesel engine exhaust is expected to reduce the lung cancer risk (per kWh). In addition to the critical effects, human and animal inhalation studies associate exposure to older technology diesel engine exhaust with sensory irritation, increased airway resistance, cardiovascular effects, genotoxicity and adjuvant <b>allergenic</b> <b>effects.</b> There are also animal studies indicating neuroinflammatory effects, developmental effects and effects on the male reproductive function. When evaluating the health risk of diesel exhausts it is important to take into account that the transition from “old” to “new” technology diesel engines is expected to take a long time.

40|$|Väitöskirjassa tutkittiin kemiallisesti erilaisten kaupallisten pyretroidiyhdisteiden: Biospray, tehoaine pyretriini, Biokill, tehoaine permetriini ja Ripcord, tehoaine sypermetriini, myrkyllisyyttä. Pyretroidiyhdisteet ovat laajasti kotitalouksissa ja maataloudessa käytettyjä hyönteismyrkkyjä, joihin lähes jokainen törmää (Esim. Raidissa,jota käytetään kärpästen torjuntaan on pyretriiniä ja BioKill-suihkeessa, jota käytetään kotitalouksissa yleisesti esim. ruusujen kirvojen torjuntaan). Tutkimus oli in vitro-tutkimus, jossa ei käytetty koe-eläimiä, vaan pääasiassa ihmisen hermoston ja rintarauhasen soluja, joita altistettin pyretroidiyhdisteillä. Myrkyllisyys todettiin lähinnä solun ennergiatalouden (ATP-energian) muutoksina sekä mikroskoopisessa tarkastelussa. Tutkimuksessa todettiin hermosolujen olevan herkkiä pyretroidiyhdisteille. Yllättävää oli, että pyretriini, joka on eräästä kasvista saatava luonnon yhdiste oli synteettistä yhdistettä (permetriiniä) haitallisempi esim. solukalvolle. Yllättävää oli myös se, että soluviljelmissä mikroskoopiset havainnot osoittivat solujen voivan huonosti jo hyvin alhaisissa pyretroidikonsentraatioissa, vaikka metabolia (mm solun energian kulutus) näytti toimivan vielä erittäin hyvin. Eli mikroskooppitutkimus voisi olla hyvä esitutkimusmenetelmä, kun arvioidaan kemikaalien myrkyllisyyttä. Uutta oli myös se, että pyretroidit näyttivät lisäävän estrogeenin vaikutusta ihmisen maitorauhasen soluissa (syöpäsolulinja). Solujen kasvu oli varsin merkittävää, kun soluviljelmään, jossa oli estrogeeniä mukana lisättiin pyretroidiyhdisteitä. Tarvitaan kuitenkin vielä lisätutkimuksia asian todentamiseksi ja erityisesti mekanismin selvittämiseksi. Pyrethroids are {{insecticides}} {{widely used}} in agriculture and gardening. They form a group of chemically different compounds {{with a high degree}} of efficacy and low human toxicity. Pyrethroids are often regarded as a modern generation of 'safe' insecticides, because they are rapidly metabolised in mammals and ecosystems, which explains their low toxicity. The natural pyrethroid compounds, pyrethrins, were already known in China in the first century AD. In the 1940 s the producing of synthetic pyrethroids began, and pyrethroid compounds are now routinely synthesised by the agrochemical industry. The neurotoxicity of pyrethroids is based on their effects on the neuronal cell membrane. Previously, the voltage-sensitive sodium channel has been studied as a principal molecular target site for pyrethroids. The non-neurotoxic effects referred to are e. g. <b>allergenic</b> <b>effects,</b> oestrogenic effects and interaction with the cell cycle. In the present in vitro study, three commercial pyrethroid products (Biospray, Biokill and Ripcord) were studied. In Biospray S, pyrethrin is the active compound, while Biokill contains permethrin and Ripcord cypermethrin. The neurotoxicity was investigated in studies of neural membrane effects in isolated rat brain synaptosomes, and the acute cell toxic effects were followed in neuronal cell cultures. The hormone-like effects were evaluated in a human breast carcinoma cell line. In synaptosomal membranes, the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) was shown to be a target site for the membrane effect of pyrethroids. Piperonyl butoxide, a well-known synergist of pyrethrin, potentiated the synaptosome ATPase -inhibiting effect of pyrethrin. In the SH-SY 5 Y neuroblastoma cultures, the viability of the cells decreased in acute exposures. The toxic effect was dependent on the chemical structure of the respective pyrethroid compounds. Pyrethroids without an alpha cyano group (pyrethrin and permethrin) were less toxic than cypermethrin with the same group. Microscopic photographs confirmed the result of the biochemical viability tests. The morphological changes were seen in the exposed cultures even at concentrations lower than those obtained with the viability tests. In human breast carcinoma cell line (MCF- 7), pyrethroid compounds had a clearly synergistic effect with oestradiol. At low concentrations, pyrethroids increased markedly the cell proliferative effect of oestradiol, but at high concentrations, their effect was cell toxic. The cell toxicity was studied with two biochemical viability tests: WST- 1 test based on the mitochondrial metabolic enzyme activity and, ATP test based on the total cellular ATP content. The present study showed that the neural membrane integral protein ATPase is a target for the effects of pyrethroids. The different acute toxicities of the test compounds in the neuroblastoma cell line confirmed the toxicity-increasing effect of the alpha cyano group in the pyrethroid structure. The in vitro study on breast carcinoma cell line showed the oestrogen-like effect of pyrethroids, which should receive special attention when the toxic risks of pyrethroids are further evaluated...|$|R

In this study, {{our aim was to}} determine whether tobacco dust has any effect on lung functions and volumes. A questionnaire about working conditions was applied to 448 workers, some of which had been exposed to tobacco dust while others had not, and all workers underwent measurements of spirometric flow and volume. Of the study group, 126 workers were exposed to tobacco dust for more than 10 years and 55 were not. All of these 181 workers were also nonsmokers. There were statistically significant differences between exposed and unexposed workers in FEV 1 (p< 0. 05), PEFR (p< 0. 01) and MMEF (p< 0. 01) percentages. In conclusion, it is thought that exposure to tobacco dust for long periods affects the lung functions and some measurements should be taken in the working area {{to reduce the amount of}} tobacco dust and prevent its inhalation...|$|R
40|$|Surfactants are a {{class of}} {{chemical}} products that have wide applications. The existing commercial surfactants extensively used in the cleaning agents and health care products are produced from petrochemical resources. Besides the limitation of the petrochemical resources and low degradability of the petrochemical-based synthesized surfactants, their toxicity and <b>allergenic</b> side <b>effects</b> on the human health need to be seriously considered which has thus prompted the use of oleochemicals such as palm oil to replace petrochemicals as natural raw material in the surfactants production. In this work, synthesis of palm oil based surfactants was investigated. The reaction of palm oil ethyl esters with polyethylene glycol 600 was selected as a possible approach for synthesis of surfactants. Transesterification of palm oil with ethanol which {{is also known as}} ethanolysis was the basic reaction for the production of palm oil ethyl esters. The optimization and kinetic studies were first conducted on chemical ethanolysis of palm oil. Major parameters including the reaction temperature, molar ratio of the reactants and catalyst concentration were determined by means of design of experiments and response surface methodology through the optimization study. The study showed a reduced cubic model with excellent conformity between the actual values of conversion and the predicted amounts of palm oil ethyl ester conversion. Numerical optimization studies on the reaction showed that high ethyl ester conversions are achievable by minimizing the ethanol usage and reaction temperature, while maximizing the concentration of the alkaline catalyst. A reaction temperature of 25 ˚C, 12 : 1 molar ratio of ethanol:oil and 1. 25 wt...|$|R
40|$|Occupational {{exposure}} to low-molecular-weight (LMW) allergens such as acid anhydrides {{can result in}} occupational asthma, an allergic disease characterized by episodic airway obstruction, airways inflammation, and non specific airways hyperresponsiveness. Since LMW irritants can provoke rather similar effects and since most, if not all, LMW allergens have irritant properties, this study addressed the distinction between <b>allergenic</b> and irritant <b>effects</b> of the respiratory allergen trimellitic anhydride (TMA). BN rats were sensitized by dermal application of TMA or vehicle alone and 3 weeks later were challenged by inhalation of a slightly irritating concentration of TMA or the vehicle. Lung function was measured before, during, and shortly after challenge. One day after challenge, in vivo and in vitro nonspecific airways hyperresponsiveness to methacholine was measured, and bronchoalveolar lavage was performed to measure total protein, lactate dehydrogenase, N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, and total and differential leukocyte numbers in the fluid. In addition, IgE measurements and histopathological examinations of the respiratory tract were carried out. TMA challenge of sensitized, but not sham-sensitized, BN rats reduced breathing frequency during challenge, elevated total and TMA-specific serum IgE levels, and caused a typical allergic asthma-associated airway pathology, as observed earlier. Vehicle challenge did not cause these effects, irrespective of sensitization. Hyperresponsiveness to methacholine was only seen in TMA-sensitized and -challenged rats. These rats also showed increased levels of the biochemical parameters and increased numbers of eosinophils and neutrophils in the lung lavage fluid; TMA challenge of sham-sensitized rats caused similar but markedly less pronounced effects. During TMA challenge of sham-sensitized rats, a breathing pattern typical of irritation was noticed but a clearly distinct pattern was seen upon TMA challenge of sensitized rats. In conclusion, TMA challenge of sensitized rats caused sensitization-dependent asthma-like early changes in breathing pattern that clearly could be distinguished from irritant-induced changes and non-specific airways hyperresponsiveness 24 h after challenge. Sensitization-dependent functional changes were accompanied by inflammatory changes characteristic of asthma and biochemical evidence of airway damage. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

40|$|Aim. To examine an irritating effect, and the presence/absence of {{sensitizing}} {{effect of the}} «Oflinim» ointment, the acute toxicity has been studied to obtain toxicological specification of the remedy being developed. Methods. Toxicological specification of the «Oflinim» developed ointment has been studied by the “acute” experiment on warm-blooded animals – albino “Wistar” rats, albino mice, guinea pigs, “Chinchilla” rabbits according to the toxicological, biochemical and statistical methods. Considering the ointment is a drug for external use, its potential toxicological effect for different routes of administration in human’s organism {{according to the requirements}} has been studied. Due {{to the fact that the}} «Oflinim» ointment contains active pharmaceutical ingredients, which are used both in pharmacy and in medicine, every component is used in low doses, and terms of use is limited to several days, the carcinogenic activity of remedy has not been studied. To identify toxicological specification of the «Oflinim» developed ointment, determination of safety degree at its both gastrointestinal administration (single and multiple use), and administration through integuments has been examined. Irritating effect of the «Oflinim» ointment when applied to skin (single and multiple use), as well as upon contact with the eyes mucous membranes, has been determined. Results. It has been determined by pharmacological studies that median lethal dose (LD 50) at single application to the skin is more than 2500. 0 mg/kg. At single gastrointestinal administration, median lethal dose (LD 50) for warm-blooded animals – albino rats and albino mice was more than 5000 mg/kg. Conclusion. Toxicological specification of the «Oflinim» ointment has been studied by conventional methods and in “acute” experiment on warm-blooded animals – albino rats and albino mice. It has been determined by pre-clinical trials that the developed dosage form can be estimated as toxicologically safe ((LD 50 > 70 g/kg), and it does not show any <b>allergenic</b> and irritating <b>effect</b> on the eyes mucous membranes and skin</p...|$|R

CHANGES IN HAEMOGRAM OF PULMОNARY TB PATIENTS DURING POSITIVE CLІNICAL AND RADIOLOGY IMPROVEMENT N. A. Matsegora, M. Yu. Golubenko, O. Ya. Lekan, L. P. Omelian Odessa National Medical University Summary We studied changes in the complete blood count in 48 patients with infiltrative and disseminated pulmonary tuberculosis before and after treatment against positive clinical and radiographic improvement. The haemogram of patients with tuberculosis varies during the treatment. The mean concentration of haemoglobin in red blood cells and the count of red blood cells in peripheral blood of patients with infiltrative (in 60 % of cases) and disseminated (in 45 % of cases) tuberculosis increased equally: Hb to 139. 5 and 139. 3 g/l; RBC to 4. 33 ∙ 10 ^ 12 /l and 4. 4 ∙ 10 ^ 12 /l, respectively. In 9 (36 ± 9. 2 %) patients with infiltrative tuberculosis, there was a reduction in the average haemoglobin content in red blood cells of patients to 117. 7 g/l, while in disseminated tuberculosis, haemoglobin level did not fall below 132. 7 g/l. The obtained results are explained both by a more intensive haematotoxic effect of tuberculosis infection (in case of significant infiltration) and by a toxic adverse effect of prolonged specific chemotherapy, which these patients require. In the haemogram of patients with infiltrative tuberculosis, there was a greater severity of inflammation events, and in disseminated form – of allergic and autoimmune processes. In favourable cases, quantity and quality of blood cells become normal, reflecting the cessation of bacterial excretion, toxicity, and discussion of foci and areas of infiltration. <b>Allergenic</b> or toxic <b>effects</b> of different antibacterial medicines on haematopoiesis cannot be excluded. They often caused eosinophilia, in some cases - leukocytosis, band left shift, lymphocytosis, rarely leukopenia, which may stimulate the lymphoid and reticular reaction. The results indicate the feasibility to add TB chemotherapy with cytoprotective medicines. Key words: haemogram of patients with tuberculosis...|$|R
