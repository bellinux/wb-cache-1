Once again the RHS helped by providing a venue, free of charge, for The Festival of Floral Decoration held on 14 and 15 July 1959 in order to raise funds.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now located there. Petersen owned the country house [...] "Gimle" [...] near Frogner Church, and led an active upper-class social life there.

5000|$|In 1953 Østby {{competed in}} the Canoe Slalom World Championships in Meran, Italy. He was {{considered}} as being without any sporting hopes for the competition, having no prior experience with whitewater kayaking - the newspaper Verdens Gang quoted him as saying [...] "I don't even {{know what kind of}} boat to use". The participation was essentially regarded as a test to see whether slalom kayaking should be taken up in Norway - where it was largely unknown, despite the country's abundance of whitewater locations. Østby was the only competitor from Norway, but the vice chairman of Norwegian Canoe Association traveled with him to help evaluate the championship. The stay and the travel to Italy were paid for in full by the Italian <b>arrangement</b> <b>committee.</b> As it turned out, whitewater kayaking did not reach Norway until the 1960s and was not organized within the Norwegian Canoe Association until 1972.|$|R

40|$|If {{all goes}} {{according}} to plan you will be reading this President’s message during springtime (or fall depending in which hemisphere you are located) and the birds will be chirping and the flowers will be in bloom {{and one of the}} worst winters on record will be a distant memory. Over the past several months, I heard from members who due to weather conditions were without electricity for several days, who had snow day closures in places where it seldom snows and who received warnings from local authorities to shelter in place.
