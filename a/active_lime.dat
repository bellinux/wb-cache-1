The 19th century prison wall, along with a huge rock outcrop of highly significant geological importance - Withies Wall - was demolished in June 1993 by the quarry owner of the time, despite not seeking permission or having any regard for the scheduled status of the wall. This Victorian security wall had old sentry posts. There was local outcry following this event, and today only a small section of the wall remains.|$|R

40|$|Introduction. The {{article is}} devoted to the {{development}} of techniques for quantitative analysis of lime flower in order to make amendments to existing pharmacopoeian monographs for this herbal drug. Lime inflorescences contain lipophilic biologically active substances (BAS) causing notable antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects and also more polar phenolic compounds with antiulcer activity. Considering this, it’s necessary to regulate all these groups of BAS quantitatively. Materials and methods. For this study six batches of lime flowers harvested in 2008 - 2009 yrs. in Kharkiv, Rivno and Zhitomir regions were used as crude herbal drug. Loss on drying was determined by routine pharmacopoeian procedures. Total content of lipophilic substances was determined gravimetrically after Soxhlet extraction of samples 1, 5, 7 and 10 g in weight with methylene chloride, considering that by its extracting ability this solvent is close to liquefied difluorochloromethane (freon R 22) used by us for obtaining of lipophilic complexes. The duration of complete analytical extraction was determined by infusion of six 10 g assays of lime flowers during 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 hours, then quantity of lipophilic extractives was revealed gravimetrically. Quantity of essential oil in lime flowers was evaluated under the procedure of ЕР 7, 2. 8. 12. Weight of the herbal drug sample was 200 g, distillation rate – 2, 5 - 3, 5 ml/min, volume of distillation liquid (water) – 500 ml, volume of xylene in the graduated tube – 0, 50 ml. Total flavonoid content recalculated to quercetin was determined after hydrolysis with acidified acetone, withdrawing of flavonoid aglycones with ethylacetate and by further spectrophotometry of their complexes with aluminium chloride. All quantitative determinations were replicated five times for each assay. All chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade. Results and discussion. It was found that adequate accuracy of the analysis of lipophilic extractives taken with methylene chloride was achieved if assay weight is not less than 7 g: relative error was less than 2 %. Study of extraction kinetics showed that after 4 hours lipophilic substances soluble in methylene chloride were taken almost completely. Analyzing 6 batches of lime flowers from different Ukrainian regions, it was found that yield of total extractives taken with methylene chloride did fall within insignificant limits – 1, 86 - 2, 26 %, that testifies onto rather stable accumulation of these biologically <b>active</b> substances in <b>lime</b> flowers even despite different climatic conditions. Essential oil content varied in rather wide limits – 0, 34 - 0, 55 ml/kg of herbal drug and considerably depended on harvest place: in the batches from Northwest of Ukraine this value was less than in the Eastern ones. Year of harvesting had less influence on quantity of essential oil in lime flowers. The relative error of the quantitative determinations was within 4 – 8 %. Total flavonoid content in the analyzed batches of lime flowers was considerably variable (from 0, 30 to 0, 52 %) and depended mainly on place of harvesting, and this crude herbal drug from the northwest of Ukraine (Rivno region) showed the highest results among the analyzed samples. Besides, if consider the lower limit regulated by the monograph of Belarusian Pharmacopoeia, p. 370, then only one batch conformed to the norm (not less than 0, 5 %). Therefore it’s recommended to fix the lower limit 0, 3 % for content of total flavonoids in the corresponding monograph draft or analytical normative documentation. The relative error of the quantitative determinations of flavonoids was within 1, 5 – 3, 1 %. Conclusion. Six batches of lime flowers harvested in various regions of Ukraine in 2008 and 2009 yrs. were investigated. Based on the results obtained it is offered to regulate the following quantity parameters in the amended monograph draft for lime flower: total extractives taken with methylene chloride – not less than 1, 8 %, essential oil content – not less than 0, 3 ml/kg, total flavonoid content recalculated as quercetin - not less than 0, 3 %...|$|R

L. mariae-josephi endosymbionts are extremely slowgrowing bacteria with genetic and symbiotic characteristics that differentiate them from Bradyrhizobium strains nodulating Lupinus spp. native of the Iberian Peninsula and adapted to grow in acid soils. Cross-inoculation experiments revealed that all the endosymbiotic isolates from L. mariae-josephi tested are legume-host selective and are unable to nodulate species such as L. angustifolius, and L. luteus.

The main subject of this work was to investigate the consequence of two contrasting levels of soil fertility on the nutritional status of an orange grove [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb. cv. Valencia Late]. The field experiment was conducted in a commercial citrus grove using mature trees distributed in two plots with different values of SOM, phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), but with the same level of <b>active</b> <b>lime.</b> The concentration of nitrogen (N), P, K, magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), Fe, copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and manganese (Mn) in young and mature leaves and flowers was evaluated. The level of Mg and the Mg/Zn ratio in flowers from both plots, although significantly different, only indicated moderate Fe chlorosis, as predicted by a previously developed model, and was consistent with the amount of chlorophyll present in the leaves. However, nutrient partitioning between leaves of contrasting age was very different. Mature leaves from trees grown in the high-fertility plot (HF) had larger concentrations of N, P, and K but lower concentrations of Ca, Fe, and Mn than did those from the low-fertility plot (LF). Young leaves from the LF had more N, P, Mg, Cu, and Mn and less Ca and Fe than did those from the HF.

Five plants of the cultivar ‘Big Top’ grafted onto itself, onto plum rootstock ‘Mr. S. 2 / 5 ’ and onto hybrid peach x almond rootstock ‘GF 677 ’ were grown in 25 -liter containers under three treatments, 0 %, 20 %, 30 % concentration of total lime, obtained by mixing powdered CaCO 3 to a sandy soil. Plants were fertilized with manure and a solid fertilizer in early spring and irrigated in summer periodically with water rich in manganese. After just 28 days, <b>active</b> <b>lime</b> caused a decrease of chlorophyll SPAD index especially in plants grafted on itself, while those grafted on the tolerant ‘GF 677 ’ rootstock behaved better than those grafted on ‘Mr. S. 2 / 5 ’. From June to September, irrigation caused increases in soil Mn concentration and Mn concentration in control plants. This caused first a serious defoliation in BigTop/BigTop plants and then a re-greening of cultivar grafted onto ‘Mr. S. 2 / 5 ’ and ‘GF 677 ’, probably due to the interaction between iron and manganese at high pH. In particular the 20 % CaCO 3 addition to the soil preserved the plants of cultivar grafted onto ‘Mr. S. 2 / 5 ’ from Mn toxicity, as shown by their high chlorophyll content and growth and lower Mn leaf concentrations. Plants grafted onto ‘GF 677 ’ rootstock showed the best behaviour under 30 % CaCO 3 treatment associated to higher Fe(III) -reducing capacity and photosynthetic activity.

40|$|AbstractOne {{method for}} {{reducing}} CO 2, the green house gas emissions is to capture CO 2 before it releases {{into the atmosphere}} and then sequestrate it. <b>Active</b> <b>lime</b> (main component, CaO) {{can be used to}} capture CO 2 in the exhaust gas or in the reactor from fossil fuels utilization effectively. That is calcium oxide (CaO) absorbs CO 2 to yield calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) (Eq. (1)), then the CaCO 3 is thermally decomposed to CaO again and release nearly pure CO 2 (Eq. (2)) for sequestration. To obtain a nearly pure CO 2 stream from CaCO 3 decomposition, the heat for decomposing CaCO 3 can be supplied by combusting fossil fuels, such as coal and natural gas, in a calciner with oxygen fuel combustion. The oxygen diluted by CO 2 (CO 2 cycle) or H 2 O (steam cycle), in order to obtain near pure CO 2 stream from CaCO 3 decomposition. In our previous studie s 4 - 6, it was clarified that calcinations of limestone (main component, CaCO 3) in a fluidized bed calciner can be performed in CO 2 cycle atmosphere when the bed temperature was raised above 1293 K, whereas with 60 % steam cycle in atmosphere, limestone can be decomposed at comparatively lower temperature, such as 1173 K. The decomposition conversions of the limestone were about 95 % and 98 %, in CO 2 cycle and in steam cycle atmospheres, respectively. Reducing the calcinations temperature of limestone was helpful to produce more than 30 % active CaO as shown in previous stud y 4 - 6. In this study, the energy of CaCO 3 calcination process by H 2 O (steam) cycle was analyzed and compared with CaCO 3 calcination process by CO 2 cycle. For process calculations, the mass and energy flows were calculated iteratively, based on the input and output balances, until err [(input–output) /input] was < 0. 01.

Three shoots per vine and five vines per treatment were selected. One hundred mL of each Fe treatment (5 mM) were sprayed on mature leaves (treated), and young leaves (covered) were covered so Fe translocation could be studied. Treatments were repeated once after 2 weeks. Leaf blades were sampled before the first spray application {{and at the end of}} the assay, 4 weeks later, and 2 weeks after the second spray application. Micronutrient content [(Fe, manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) ] in leaf blades was determined and Fe/Mn ratio was calculated as a Fe nutrition index. Leaf chlorophyll content was measured weekly using a noninvasive Minolta SPAD chlorophyll meter. As expected, all Fe treatments resulted in greater leaf Fe concentration than in the untreated control; however, leaves sprayed with Fe-EDTA and Fe-sulfate showed the greatest Fe concentration. As consequence, the largest Fe/Mn ratio was found for Fe-EDTA and Fe-sulfate treatments, although no differences with Fe-EDDS treatment were found. Leaves sprayed with Fe-EDTA chelate showed not only the greatest SPAD readings at the end of the field experiment but also the greatest SPAD readings when measured on covered leaves from the 15 th day after treatment application when compared to untreated control. Covered leaves from all vines sprayed with Fe treatments showed greater Fe concentrations than untreated control but only the Fe/Mn ratio for Fe-EDTA was significantly greater than that of untreated control. The inconsistency between total Fe concentration from the sprayed leaves and SPAD readings in both sprayed and covered leaves suggests that the proposed methodology is valid for assessing the Fe translocation rate from mature to young leaves when foliar fertilization was appliedFinancial support was provided by the AGL 2010 - 18048 Project, funded by the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (Spain).

Ten isolates of L. mariae-josephi endosymbiotic bacteria were obtained using trap-plants and soils from five sampling points within a native plant population area in Llombai (Valencia, Spain). The microsymbionts are extra-slow (ultrabradytrophic) growing bacteria with phenotypic and symbiotic characteristics singularly different from Bradyrhizobium strains nodulating other Lupinus spp. thriving in the Iberian Peninsula and adapted to growth in acidic soils. Cross-inoculation experiments revealed that these L. mariae-josephi endosymbiotic bacteria isolates are unable to nodulate or efficiently fix nitrogen with other Lupinus spp. Their phylogenetic status was examined by a multilocus sequence analysis of four housekeeping genes (16 S rDNA, glnII, recA, atpD) and the symbiotic nodC gene. The 16 S rDNA phylogenetic analysis showed that L. mariae-josephi isolates are related to strains nodulating Retama spp. in northeastern Algeria (Boulila et al., 2009), Phaseolus lunatus from Peru (Ormeño-Orrillo et al., 2006), {{as well as to}} B. elkanii, B. jicamae and B. pachyrhizi species, forming a new clade (Clade I) within the Bradyrhizobium genus. All the single and concatenated glnII+recA and glnII+recA+atpD analyses consistently support the existence of Clade I, and also revealed that, within this clade, the L. mariae-josephi endosymbiotic bacteria belong to a single evolutionary lineage that also includes strains nodulating Retama spp. from northeastern Algeria. Within this new Bradyrhizobium lineage, the phylogenetic analyses performed showed essentially convergent results indicating that the tested L. mariae-josephi isolates nested in three sub-groups that might correspond to novel sister Bradyrhizobium species. Bradyrhizobium Clade I is highly differentiated from the Bradyrhizobium clade (Clade II) that includes currently named Bradyrhizobium species and well-delineated unnamed genospecies. Singularly, all the endosymbiotic bacteria from Lupinus species adapted to acid soils in the Iberian Peninsula and tested in this study are included in Clade II. They are related either to strains of the B. canariense or B. japonicum lineages. The phylogenetic analysis based on the symbiotic nodC gene showed that L. mariae-josephi endosymbiotic bacteria define a novel branch in the nodC Bradyrhizobium tree. This branch groups together with a branch that gathers isolates from recently studied legume symbiosis such as isolates from Retama spp., which suggests the existence of a common unique ancestor for the symbiotic genes of these two groups of bradyrhizobia. In contrast, the symbiotic genes of isolates from other Lupinus spp. from the Iberian Peninsula are clearly related to the B. canariense lineage. The allopatric (geographic) speciation of the L. mariae-josephi bradyrhizobia may result from the colonization of a singular habitat, such as the basic and high calcium carbonate soils of the Valencia area, by its unique legume host...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn-situ CO 2 capture in coal {{utilization}} captures CO 2 during {{coal combustion}} or gasification such as Oxygen fuel combustion or HyPr-RING. coal gasification processes. Regarding Oxufuel combustion, Callide Oxyfuel Project has been being conducted {{as the world}} first project to apply the technology to an existing power plant, Callide A Power Station # 4 unit (30 MWe) with injection of captured CO 2 into the underground. This is a Japan-Australia collaboration project and JCOAL participates in it as a supporting collaborator. JCOAL also proposed a novel coal gasification method-,HyPr-RING (Hydrogen Production by Reaction-Integrated Novel Gasification). HyPr-RING method utilizes a chemical looping with the calcium cycle, in which CaO (or Ca(OH) 2) captures CO 2 during coal gasification completely to form CaCO 3 and release heat for gasification to produce near pure hydrogen in one gasifier. This paper introduces the current developing status of the HyPr-RING method, mainly including the experimental examination of the transition of sorbent particle size distribution, ash and sulfur concentration of materials at several locations of gasification and calcination system for the HyPr-RING process. And the plant cold gas efficiency which should be affected by ash separation was also analyzed. As the results, {{it was found that}} coal ash and sulfur concentrated highly in the process of calcination after cyclone. If it is possible, separate and remove ash and sulfur by applying devices like filter or/and cyclone separator, the plant coal gas efficiency may raise 2 points than that in the previous study in which a part of recycled sorbent was rejected without separation. One method for reducing CO 2, the green house gas emissions is to capture CO 2 before it releases into the atmosphere and then sequestrate it. <b>Active</b> <b>lime</b> (main component, CaO) can be used to capture CO 2 in the exhaust gas or in the reactor from fossil fuels utilization effectively. That is calcium oxide (CaO) absorbs CO 2 to yield calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) (Eq. (1)), then the CaCO 3 is thermally decomposed to CaO again and release nearly pure CO 2 (Eq. (2)) for sequestration. To obtain a nearly pure CO 2 stream from CaCO 3 decomposition, the heat for decomposing CaCO 3 can be supplied by combusting fossil fuels, such as coal and natural gas, in a calciner with oxygen fuel combustion. The oxygen diluted by CO 2 (CO 2 cycle) or H 2 O (steam cycle), in order to obtain near pure CO 2 stream from CaCO 3 decomposition. In our previous studies 4 − 6, it was clarified that calcinations of limestone (main component, CaCO 3) in a fluidized bed calciner can be performed in CO 2 cycle atmosphere when the bed temperature was raised above 1293  K, whereas with 60 % steam cycle in atmosphere, limestone can be decomposed at comparatively lower temperature, such as 1173  K. The decomposition conversions of the limestone were about 95 % and 98 %, in CO 2 cycle and in steam cycle atmospheres, respectively. Reducing the calcinations temperature of limestone was helpful to produce more than 30 % active CaO as shown in previous study 4 − 6. In this study, the energy of CaCO 3 calcination process by H 2 O (steam) cycle was analyzed and compared with CaCO 3 calcination process by CO 2 cycle. For process calculations, the mass and energy flows were calculated iteratively, based on the input and output balances, until err [(input-output) /input] was < 0. 01. Analysis showed that, although H 2 O (steam) cycle calcination had calcination energy more about 3. 6 % than CO 2 cycle due to water evaporation latent heat loss, however, the calcination energy per active CaO was lowest for H 2 O (steam) cycle...|$|E
