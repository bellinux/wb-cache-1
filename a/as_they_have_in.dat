Films are a contemporary form of mythmaking, reflecting our response to ourselves and the mysteries and wonders of our existence.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{situation}} in Iraqi Kurdistan (the three northern governorates with primarily Kurdish populations) is quite different. Due to their better stability, the Kurdish semi-autonomous area enjoys health care superior to that under Saddam. Health workers have not left the provinces for Syria or Jordan, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> sectarian Iraq, and new programs for continuing professional education in major Iraqi Kurdish cities reflect the optimism of the area.|$|E
25|$|Stephen Harper and Jack Layton are {{reported}} to have {{said that if the}} Green Party were included, they would not participate in the Leaders' Debates. Dion said that while he supports May's inclusion, he would not attend if Harper does not, and the Bloc Québécois has stated it will not boycott the debates if May is included. The media consortium in charge of the debate, made up of the CBC, CTV, Global Television and TVA, had decided that it would prefer to broadcast the debates with the four major party leaders, rather than risk not at all or with minimal participation. The Green Party indicated they had begun procedures to lodge a formal complaint with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> past federal elections.|$|E

25|$|If {{you wish}} you may tell the police {{to be careful not}} to rile me. Of course, I am a {{reasonable}} spirit. I take no offense at the way they have conducted their investigations in the past. In fact, they have been so utterly stupid as to not only amuse me, but His Satanic Majesty, Francis Josef, etc. But tell them to beware. Let them not try to discover what I am, for it were better that they were never born than to incur the wrath of the Axeman. I don't think there is any need of such a warning, for I feel sure the police will always dodge me, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the past. They are wise and know how to keep away from all harm.|$|E
2500|$|According to Chappell, [...] "A beaker {{found in}} a pit near the winter {{solstice}} post bore a circle and cross symbol that for many Native Americans symbolizes the Earth and the four cardinal directions. Radiating lines probably symbolized the sun, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> countless other civilizations." [...] The woodhenges were significant to {{the timing of the}} agricultural cycle.|$|E
2500|$|Recent trends. Recently supply {{voltages}} in analog circuits {{have decreased}} (<b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> digital logic) and low-voltage op-amps {{have been introduced}} reflecting this. [...] Supplies of 5V and increasingly 3.3V (sometimes as low as 1.8V) are common. [...] To maximize the signal range modern op-amps commonly have rail-to-rail output (the output signal can range from the lowest supply voltage to the highest) and sometimes rail-to-rail inputs.|$|E

2500|$|A 2006 United Nations report {{stated that}} [...] "there is enough water for everyone", but {{that access to}} it is {{hampered}} by mismanagement and corruption. In addition, global initiatives to improve the efficiency of aid delivery, such as the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, have not been taken up by water sector donors as effectively <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> education and health, potentially leaving multiple donors working on overlapping projects and recipient governments without empowerment to act.|$|E
2500|$|Researchers use {{statistical}} processes on a student's past {{test scores}} {{to predict the}} student's future test scores, {{on the assumption that}} students usually score approximately as well each year <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> past years. [...] The student's actual score is then compared to the predicted score. [...] The difference between the predicted and actual scores, if any, is assumed to be due to the teacher and the school, rather than to the student's natural ability or socioeconomic circumstances.|$|E
2500|$|The 1859 {{publication}} of Charles Darwin's theory {{of natural selection}} put forward an explanation for complexity and adaptation, which reflects scientific consensus {{on the origins of}} biological diversity. In the eyes of some, this provided a counter-argument to the watchmaker analogy: for example, the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins referred to the analogy in his 1986 book The Blind Watchmaker giving his explanation of evolution. Others, however, consider the watchmaker analogy to be compatible with evolutionary creation, opining that the two concepts are not mutually exclusive. In the 19th century, deists, who championed the watchmaker analogy, held that Darwin's theory fit with [...] "the principle of uniformitarianism—the idea that all processes in the world occur now <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the past" [...] and that deistic evolution [...] "provided an explanatory framework for understanding species variation in a mechanical universe." ...|$|E

60|$|We may restate our {{theory as}} follows: If we {{take such a}} belief as 'Othello {{believes}} that Desdemona loves Cassio', we will call Desdemona and Cassio the object-terms, and loving the object-relation.
