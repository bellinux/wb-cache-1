40|$|Introduction. Differentiated thyroid {{carcinoma}} (DTC) {{is a rare}} childhood malignancy, as {{it represents}} 0. 3 - 0. 4 % of pediatric malignancies. Papillary carcinoma {{is the most common}} type of pediatric DTC and it represents about 90 % of <b>all</b> <b>DTC</b> patients. Although rare, DTC arising from dyshormonogenetic goiter is the most serious complication of congenital hypothyroidism. Case report. We presented the development of thyroid papillary carcinoma in a 15 -year-old girl diagnosed with congenital dyshormonogenetic hypothyroidism at neonatal age. Considering the early initiation and proper dosage of hormonal substitution, normal levels of thyreotropin and thyroid hormones were achieved quickly and maintained through a follow-up period. The girl remained euthyroid and asymptomatic until 13. 8 years of age, when she presented with a large multinodular goiter. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy. Pathological examination revealed intrathyroid microcarcinoma in the right lobe. Conclusion. Although differentiated thyroid carcinoma is a rare pediatric malignancy, it is of great importance to have a certain degree of clinical caution and provide a multidisciplinary approach during the follow-up of patients with dyshormonogenetic hypothyroidism...|$|R
40|$|Background Effective {{screening}} procedures and advances in medical imaging technologies have seen increased detection of the differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC). However, management of DTC patients still remains controversial owing {{to differences in}} opinion {{on the extent of}} surgery (thyroid lobectomy or total thyroidectomy) and the need of radioiodine ablation (RIA) post-surgery. Aim This study was aimed to establish a local protocol for DTC management at Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital (DGMAH). The protocol emphasizes on multidisciplinary management whereby, the nuclear medicine physicians, endocrinologists and surgeons decide on the extent of thyroid resection. The protocol emphasizes on total thyroidectomy for <b>all</b> <b>DTC</b> patients since it reduces morbidity and also optimizes the management of patients for further radioiodine treatment. Methods A search of scholar articles for various protocols on management of DTC was conducted using Google search engine, Science Direct and Medline. Abstracts and full texts were reviewed. Results The proposed local protocol for DGMAH emphasizes on a multidisciplinary management approach for DTC patients. Furthermore, only patients who have undergone total thyroidectomy should be managed with radioiodine. Conclusion Total thyroidectomy reduces morbidity and also optimizes the management of patient for further radioiodine treatment...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} how direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising of pharmaceutical products in affected by regulations of the Food and Drug Administration and by market conditions. We {{focus on a}} relatively under-studied segment of the pharmaceutical market [...] the market for smoking cessation products. Because of their proven effectiveness, these products could {{be the key to}} meeting public health goals to reduce smoking. However, in many ways, smoking cessation products have been more heavily regulated than cigarettes. Our empirical analysis uses data on advertising expenditures and data from an archive of print advertisements. The archive includes all smoking cessation product advertisements that appeared in over 13, 000 issues of 28 magazines between January 1985 and May 2002. Our study period begins shortly atfer the first nicotine replacement product was introduced, and covers the evolution of the market as new products are introduced while some of the older products move from prescription to over-the-counter (OTC) status. OTC status eases the disclosure requirements imposed on advertisements of prescription pharmaceuticals, substantially reducing the costs of a print advertisement. Our results suggest that OTC status is associated with an increase in advertising expenditures and the number and pages of magazine advertisements. A current proposal to reduce disclosure requirements on <b>all</b> <b>DTC</b> advertisements of prescription drugs could have similar effects. Our results also suggest that advertising increase with the introduction of new products and with market competition. ...|$|R

"December 2011 "Depth to claypan (DTC) plays an important role for Midwest claypan soils in storing plant-available water for grain crops, but it is unknown how this same soil property affects switchgrass (Panicum virgatum. L.) growth and nitrogen (N) utilization. This research assessed corn (Zea mays L), soybean (Glycine max. L. Merr.) and switchgrass productivity as influenced by the DTC. Plot research was initiated in 2009 in Columbia, Missouri on a range of DTC. Canopy reflectance sensing early in the growing season was effective at estimating yield (p=< 0. 05; r 2 = 0. 70). Corn was sensitive to DTC. The N unaccounted for in corn decreased as DTC increased while switchgrass was unaffected.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the value of 18 F-FDG PET/CT scan in DTC patients with high serum Tg level and negative 131 I WBS. Methods: 69 post-surgical DTC patients with high serum Tg level and negative post ablation 131 I WBS were enrolled in this study. <b>All</b> <b>DTC</b> patients underwent head and neck ultrasound, CT scan and whole-body 18 F-FDG PET/CT, based on the dedicated head and neck protocol. Results: Overall, 92 lesions were detected in 43 (62. 3 %) out of 69 patients with positive 18 F-FDG PET/CT scan, compared to only 39 lesions detected on CT scan in 26 (37. 7 %) out of 69 patients. The sensitivity, accuracy and negative predictive value of 18 F-FDG PET/CT were 88 %, 87 % and 76 %, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of CT scan (67. 2 %, 54. 3 % and 48. 8 %, respectively) (P 0. 05).

40|$|Background: Direct-to-consumer (DTC) {{personal}} genomic testing (PGT) allows {{individuals to}} learn about their genetic makeup without going through a physician, but some consumers share their results with their primary care provider (PCP). Objective: To describe the characteristics and perceptions of DTC PGT consumers who discuss their results with their PCP. Design: Longitudinal, prospective cohort study. Setting: Online survey before and 6 months after results. Participants: DTC PGT consumers. Measurements: Consumer satisfaction with the DTC PGT experience; whether and, if so, how many results {{could be used to}} improve health; how many results were not understood; and beliefs about the PCP's understanding of genetics. Participants were asked with whom they had discussed their results. Genetic reports were linked to survey responses. Results: Among 1026 respondents, 63 % planned to share their results with a PCP. At 6 -month follow-up, 27 % reported having done so, and 8 % reported sharing with another health care provider only. Common reasons for not sharing results with a health care provider were that the results were not important enough (40 %) or that the participant did not have time to do so (37 %). Among participants who discussed results with their PCP, 35 % were very satisfied with the encounter, and 18 % were not at all satisfied. Frequently identified themes in participant descriptions of these encounters were actionability of the results or use in care (32 %), PCP engagement or interest (25 %), and lack of PCP engagement or interest (22 %). Limitation: Participants may not be representative of <b>all</b> <b>DTC</b> PGT consumers. Conclusion: A comprehensive picture of DTC PGT consumers who shared their results with a health care provider is presented.

40|$|Thyroid {{cancer risk}} {{involves}} {{the interaction of}} genetic and environmental factors. The thyroperoxidase (TPO) has {{a key role in}} the iodine metabolism, being essential for the thyroid function. Mutations in the TPO gene are common in congenital hypothyroidism, and there are also signs of the implication of TPO in thyroid cancer. We performed a case-control association study of genetic variants in TPO and differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) in 1, 586 DTC patients and 1, 769 controls including two European populations (Italy: 1, 190 DTC and 1, 290 controls; Spain: 396 DTC and 479 controls). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed separately for each population and each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). From the three studied polymorphisms, significant associations were detected between DTC and rs 2048722 and rs 732609 in both populations (p< 0. 05). In the Italian population, both SNPs showed a negative association (rs 2048722, odds ratio [OR]= 0. 79, 95 % confidence interval [CI]= 0. 63 - 1. 00, p= 0. 045; rs 732609, OR= 0. 72, 95 % CI= 0. 55 - 0. 94, p= 0. 016), whereas in the Spanish population, these SNPs showed a positive association (rs 2048722, OR= 1. 39, 95 % CI= 1. 03 - 1. 89, p= 0. 033; rs 732609, OR= 1. 41, 95 % CI= 1. 06 - 1. 87, p= 0. 018).

40|$|While the {{discovery}} of Viagra is certainly significant, {{it is not what}} has changed the world. There were other treatments for what was referred to as impotence prior to {{the discovery}} of Viagra. What has changed the world is the marketing of this wonder drug. Thus, this dissertation examines the marketing of Viagra to identify the persuasive strategies that Pfizer has used to constitute a nation of ED sufferers and Viagra users as well as promote a drug that is arguably the most famous (or infamous) in the history of modern medicine. These strategies illustrate that there have been four keys to creating the Viagra juggernaut: (1) presuming and asserting a collective identity for consumers taking the drug; (2) offering a narrative that demonstrates this identity; (3) issuing a call to action that affirms this identity; and (4) packaging and selling the drug like a traditional consumer good. The first three of these represent the basic principles of the genre and theory known as constitutive rhetoric (Charland, 1987, 2001; Stein, 2002), which has traditionally been applied to the study of political, not marketing, communication.

Off-label sorafenib is used in Turkey with special permission by the Ministry of Health for this indication. Patients and methods: Patients with advanced DTC and MTC were retrospectively identified from the Turkish Ministry of Health database. Data on these patients were prospectively collected before permission is granted to use sorafenib. Results: Thirty patients with complete data were analyzed: 14 DTC (papillary number [n] = 10; follicular n= 4) and 16 MTC. The median age of the patients was 57 years (range: 28 – 79 years), and there were 18 males and 12 females. <b>All</b> <b>DTC</b> patients were iodine refractory and had received a median three doses of radioactive iodine (range: 1 – 7 doses). Sorafenib was used for a median of 12 months (range: 1 – 49 months). The overall response rate was 20 %, all partial responses, with no complete response. The overall response rate was 14 % in DTC and 25 % in MTC patients. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 17. 1 months (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 7. 3 – 26. 8) and overall survival (OS) was not reached. The 2 -year PFS and OS were 39 % and 68 %, respectively. DTC and MTC patients had similar survival outcomes: median PFS of 21. 3 months (95 % CI: 5. 8 – 36. 7) versus 14. 5 months (95 % CI: 3. 7 – 25. 2), respectively (P= 0. 36), with the median OS not reached in either group (P= 0. 17).

These DTCs are statistically used to analyse vehicles’ health statuses, {{which is why}} correctness in data is desirable. In workshops DTCs can however occur due to work and tests. Nevertheless are they loaded into the database without any notification. In order to perform an accurate analysis of the vehicle health status it would be desirable if such DTCs could be found and removed. The thesis has examined if this is possible by searching for patterns in DTCs, indicating whether the DTCs are generated in a workshop or not. Due to its easy interpretable outcome an Associative Classification method was used {{with the aim of}} categorising data. The classifier was built applying well-known algorithms and then two classification algorithms were developed to fit the data structure when labelling new data. The final classifier performed with an accuracy above 80 percent where no distinctive differences between the two algorithms could be found. Hardly 50 percent of <b>all</b> workshop <b>DTCs</b> were however found.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the level of distress and problems experienced by survivors of differentiated non-medullary thyroid carcinoma (DTC), using the DT and PL and whether this correlates with clinical and demographical variables. PARTICIPANTS, DESIGN AND SETTING: <b>All</b> 205 <b>DTC</b> patients, under follow-up at the outpatient clinic of our university hospital, were asked to fill in the DT and PL, hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), illness cognition questionnaire (ICQ) and an ad hoc questionnaire. Receiver Operator Characteristic analysis (ROC) was used to establish the optimal DT cut-off score according to HADS. Correlations of questionnaires scores with data on diagnosis, treatment and follow-up collected from medical records were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 159 respondents, 145 agreed to participate [118 in remission, median follow-up 7. 2 years (range 3 months- 41 years) ]. Of these, 34. 3 % rated their distress score >/= 5, indicating clinically relevant distress according to ROC analysis. Patients reported physical (86 %) over emotional problems (76 %) as sources of distress. DT scores correlated with HADS scores and ICQ subscales. No significant correlations were found between DT scores and clinical or demographical characteristics except for employment status. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of distress is high among patients with DTC even after long-term remission and cannot be predicted by clinical and demographical characteristics. DT and PL are useful screening instruments for distress in DTC patients and could easily be incorporated into daily practice...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to measure the {{radiation}} exposure rate from differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) patients who had received iodine- 131 (131 I) treatment, and to evaluate hospital discharge planning in relation to three different sets of regulations. We studied 100 patients, 78 females and 22 males, aged 13 to 79 years (mean 44. 40 Â± 15. 83 years) with DTC, in three Groups who were treated with 3. 7, 5. 5 or 7. 4 GBq of 131 I, respectively. The external whole-body dose rates following oral administration of 131 I were measured after each one of the first three hospitalization days. A multivariant linear analysis was performed, considering exposure rates as dependent variables to the administered dose for treatment, age, gender, regional and/or distant metastases, thyroglobulin (Tg), antibodies to Tg and thyroid remnant in the three dose groups. We found that the exposure rates after each of the three first days of hospitalization were 30, 50 and 70 Î¼Svh- 1 at 1 m. <b>All</b> our <b>DTC</b> patients had an acceptable dose rate on days 2 and 3 that allowed their hospital discharge. After only 1 day of hospitalization, just 3 / 11 cases showed not permissible exposure rates above 70 Î¼Svh- 1. In conclusion, it is the opinion of the authors that after measuring the exposure rates, most treated, DTC patients could be discharged after only one day of hospitalization, even some of those treated with high doses of 131 I (7. 4 GBq). Patients, who received the higher doses of 131 I, should not be released before their individual exposure rate is measured...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{association}} between differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) and chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (CLT) {{has been reported}} in literature. Aim: To evaluate the incidence of this association and to determine whether the CLT may influence on the early initial staging of DTC when associated with other variable risks. Study design: Historical (retrospective) cohort. Materials and Methods: Fifty two patients with DTC were evaluated from 1999 to 2009. They were divided into two groups. The first group had 35 patients with DTC without DLT; the second had 17 patients with CLT. Total thyroidectomy was the treatment chosen for all patients. Similarities shared in both groups such as age, gender, histological tumor type, tumor diameter, regional only or with distant metastases, extrathyroidal invasion, multifocality and presence of tumor capsule were considered. T-Student tests and Chi-square tests were applied to analyze the data. Results: The incidence of DTC without CLT was higher that of DTC+CLT (p= 0. 0126). We noticed no statistic differences between the common variables analyzed. Conclusions: CLT occurred in 33 % of the patients with DCT. <b>All</b> cases of <b>DTC</b> were in the early stages...|$|R

50|$|What are “chills” and “freezes” and {{why does}} DTC impose them? Occasionally a problem may arise with a company or its {{securities}} on deposit at DTC. In some of those cases DTC may impose a “chill” or a “freeze” on all the company’s securities. A “chill” is a restriction placed by DTC on {{one or more of}} DTC’s services, such as limiting a DTC participant’s ability to make a deposit or withdrawal of the security at DTC. A chill may remain imposed on a security for just a few days or {{for an extended period of}} time depending upon the reasons for the chill and whether the issuer or transfer agent corrects the problem. A “freeze” is a discontinuation of <b>all</b> services at <b>DTC.</b> Freezes may last a few days or an extended period of time, depending on the reason for the freeze. If the reasons for the freeze cannot be rectified, then the security will generally be removed from DTC, and securities transactions in that security will no longer be eligible to be cleared at any registered clearing agency. Chills and freezes are monitored by DTC's Office of Regulatory Compliance.|$|R
30|$|Patients with bipolar {{disorder}} {{want more information}} about the medications they take and especially about possible side effects (Bowskill et al. 2007). As more people use the Internet as a source of health information, pharmaceutical companies are expanding direct-to-consumer (DTC) promotions onto the web (Choi and Lee 2007). FDA regulation allows broadcast advertisements to reference a web site as a source of prescribing information (FDA 2010), and pharmaceutical web sites provide more detailed information than in print advertisements (Macias and Lewis 2004). Notably, pharmaceutical company web sites for brand name psychiatric medications are usually ranked on the first page in all major search engines, as demonstrated in a search for antidepressants (Graber and Weckmann 2002). There are several areas of concern with pharmaceutical web sites. Some users may not consider pharmaceutical web sites to be advertising (Choi and Lee 2007). Most users feel that pharmaceutical web sites provide information that is comprehensive and not misleading (Wymer 2010), although sites may not provide sufficient information on drug associated risks (Davis et al. 2007; Huh and Cude 2004). In a study of <b>all</b> drugs with <b>DTC</b> expenditures of at least US$ 5 million between January to June 2005, only half the web sites reported all side effects occurring at ≥ 10 % incidence (Davis et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND. Findings of mediastinal uptake of I- 131 after {{surgical}} treatment for differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) are common, especially in young patients. Given {{the frequency of}} false-positive findings, a protocol for diagnostic and their- apeutic strategies would be useful. With the goal of accurately selecting management strategies, the authors analyzed their data and data found elsewhere in the literature for correlations with the incidence of mediastinal I- 131 uptake and with treatment for patients exhibiting such I- 131 uptake. METHODS. <b>All</b> patients with <b>DTC</b> who were treated between 1978 and 2000 at Groningen University Hospital (Groningen. The Netherlands) and who received adjuvant I- 131 ablation therapy {{were included in the}} current analysis, which involved retrospective review of all relevant data. RESULTS. Five hundred four patients with DTC initially underwent total thyroidectomy, with additional I- 131 ablation performed for 489 of these patients. In 48 of 489 patients (9. 8 %), I- 131 uptake was seen in the mediastinum on a posttreatment scan. Analysis of those 48 patients and of cases in the literature demonstrated that serum thyroglobulin levels, risk status, and the presence of thymus on radiologic images were important in the surgical decision-making process. CONCLUSIONS. Mediastinal uptake of I- 131 on posttreatment scans was found in approximately 10 % of patients after total thyroidectomy for DTC. Based on the current data and the data presented in the literature, the authors developed a flow chart for determining appropriate treatment strategies, which included mediastinal dissection for high-risk patients and for patients with serum thyroglobulin levels > 10 ng/mL.

40|$|Background. Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) {{survivors}} are {{at increased risk}} of developing nonsynchronous second primary malignancy (NSPM). This study aims to examine possible risk factors leading to occurrence of NSPM as well as risk factors leading to NSPM-related death in patients with DTC. Methods. Of the 1, 106 patients with DTC managed at our institution, 92 (8. 3 %) patients developed NSPM and 40 (3. 6 %) patients died of NSPM. All causes of death were confirmed by medical record, autopsy report or death certificate. Clinicopathological variables were compared between those without NSPM and with NSPM as well as between those who died of NSPM and did not die of NSPM. Significant variables on univariate analysis were entered into a Cox proportional hazards model. Results. The median latency period from diagnosis of DTC to NSPM was 142. 7 (range 16. 8 – 511. 0) months. For occurrence of NSPM, age at DTC diagnosis C 50 years old [relative risk (RR) = 2. 35], cumulative radioactive iodine (RAI) activity 3. 0 – 8. 9 GBq (RR = 2. 38), and external local radiotherapy (ERT) (RR = 1. 95) were significant risk factors.
