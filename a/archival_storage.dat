40|$|This paper {{describes}} an architecture for an <b>archival</b> data <b>storage.</b> The design enables aggregation of storage resources in scalable fashion {{to achieve a}} highly reliable data storage. Reliability is implemented by using erasure coding which provides the less storage overhead than full replication. Scalability of the architecture is achieved through {{the ability to work}} with multiple different storage locations and a scalable metadata management system. The integrity of the data is ensured through use of cryptographic naming. Feasibility of the proposed design is assessed with a real world implementation named GB-DISK. ...|$|R

5000|$|A {{new source}} was {{introduced}} {{for the scientific}} circulation by Michał Wiszniewski in the mid 19th century, which was a recommendation letter of Russian voivode Mikołaj Sieniawski for Guagninis father and son to the King of Poland Sigismund Augustus dated 25 February 1561. It contained the following phrase in Old Polish language, [...] "Wloch z Werony pan Ambrozy, z szynem ssvym Alexandrem" [...] (Italian out of Verona Mister Ambrosius with his son Alexander). In 1860 Kazimierz Józef Turowski published excerpts out of the [...] "Description of Sarmatian Europe". In his brief article about life and works of the Italian he provides extended quotes of the Franciszek Bohomolec foreword to the 1768 edition. In 1887 Italian historian Carlo Cipolla published a big research [...] "One Italian in Poland and in Sweden {{on the border of}} the 17th century. Biographic information" [...] (Un Italiano nella Polonia e nella Svezia tra il XVI e il XVII secollo. Notizie biografiche). As a result of his search in <b>archival</b> <b>storages</b> of Venetia and Verona, the historian discovered unknown earlier sources to biography of his countryman. Among other researchers about Guagnini was Polish author Antoni Pietkiewicz who edited the Guagnini's information in the Polish [...] "Great General Illustrated Encyclopedia".
