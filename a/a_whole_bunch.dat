5|$|Early Seventies Britain {{was a very}} {{depressing}} {{place with}} both the colour strike and the UK postal workers strike in full swing. It was completely run-down with trash on the streets, and total unemployment—just about everybody was on strike. Everybody was brought up with an education system that told you point blank that if you came from {{the wrong side of}} the tracks...then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at all. Out of that came pretentious moi and the Sex Pistols and then <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> of copycat wankers after us.|$|E
25|$|All I {{suggested}} {{within that}} process was get a good, {{wide selection of}} kids. Let’s get {{a wide selection of}} personalities and temperaments and certainly skill level. Don’t give me <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> of boy scouts who are going to knock it dead out there and don’t give me <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> of absolute beginners who are setup for failure. Give me a wide variety, let’s have regular, normal kids and don’t profile beyond that.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to the mythology, {{the early}} {{moments of the}} March—getting there—was no picnic. People were afraid. We didn't know what we would meet. There was no precedent. Sitting across from me was a black preacher with a white collar. He was an AME preacher. We talked. Every now and then, people on the bus sang 'Oh Freedom' and 'We Shall Overcome,' {{but for the most}} part there wasn't <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> of singing. We were {{secretly}} praying that nothing violent happened.|$|E
5000|$|Cicero {{then begins}} {{to trace the}} origins of oratory in Rome. He {{mentions}} figures like Curius, M. Popilius, Quinius Metellus and even discusses how Cato and Lysias the Athenian resemble {{each other in their}} elegance, character, and brevity. Cicero mentions the idea that Cato is overshadowed by other figures, but is still noteworthy. After Cato, <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new <b>bunch</b> of orators appeared in Rome like Severius Galba. He also provides an example of how Galba was able to win over the court with an amazing, eloquent speech and that his people (in a court case) were freed from all charges.|$|R
50|$|In {{time the}} choir {{recognized}} this discipline and personally came to Victor to acknowledge his intent. Victor worked {{carefully on the}} timing and {{the flow of the}} services. He coordinated tones with the clergy so they and the choir remained in harmony. Yet, during the service he could quickly adjust the choir's pitch to fit the intonation of the clergy when necessary. For Victor, the services were <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> not <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> of pieces. In this even, Metropolitan Sergius was careful, often heard coordinating on which Cherubic hymn version Victor would sing that day so that he could decide on his pitch.|$|R
5000|$|Erin Miller from TV Week {{praised the}} series, saying [...] "Wonderland {{is a lot}} of fun. Its sexy, {{relatable}} and features a group of friends youll wish were your mates. Sure it echoes The Secret Life of Us, but this is <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new <b>bunch</b> of twentysomethings whose relationship and work issues will draw you in." [...] Miller added that she was looking forward to catching up with the gang every week. David Knox from TV Tonight gave the series a mixed review and pointed out that it [...] "feels too white-bread to reasonably reflect suburban Australia". He also observed that the characters are all heterosexual and only one cast member is over 40. Knox commented [...] "Wonderland boasts TVs sexiest cast, which compensates for material that is sometimes pedestrian and antics used in place of character-based humour." [...] He added that the series begins [...] "from a pleasant launch pad, but has big shoes to fill in the Offspring slot. With a bit more grunt it may just get there." ...|$|R
500|$|Former {{executives}} at Sega have mixed {{opinions of the}} 32X. [...] Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves {{as a warning to}} the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the Kinect and PlayStation Move for doing so. [...] Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, [...] "The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on. [...] An add-on device is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device." [...] Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, [...] "I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> of reasons why we couldn’t ultimately do what we had to do with that platform, without third party support and with the timing of Saturn, but I still think the project was a success for a bunch of other reasons. In hindsight, it was not a great idea for <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> of other reasons." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1994, Jackson {{spoke to}} a Billboard {{reporter}} about digital audio. Described as Apogee's president and chief engineer, he said, [...] "digital is finally living up to the warm, natural sound of analogue that we know and love." [...] A decade later, he warned against the belief that bigger specification numbers guarantee better sound quality. He noted that 192kHz sampling rate was often cited as being better than 96kHz because of it being twice as fast [...] "when in reality there's <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> of other influencing factors responsible for any audible improvements." ...|$|E
500|$|Morrison said {{afterwards}} that he [...] "wasn't very happy" [...] with it. [...] "It {{consisted of}} songs {{that were left}} over from before and that they'd finally gotten around to using. [...] It wasn't really fresh. It was <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> of songs that had been hanging around for a while. [...] I was really {{trying to make a}} country and western album." [...] He commented further that he seldom listened to it and had a bad taste in his mouth for both Street Choir and Tupelo Honey.|$|E

500|$|R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck {{wrote the}} main riff and chorus {{to the song}} on a {{mandolin}} while watching television one day. Buck had just bought the instrument and was attempting {{to learn how to}} play it, recording the music as he practiced. Buck said that [...] "when I listened back to it the next day, there was a bunch of stuff that was really just me learning how to play mandolin, and then there's what became 'Losing My Religion', and then <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> more of me learning to play the mandolin." ...|$|E
500|$|James Montgomery from MTV News {{reviewed}} the video for [...] "My First Kiss" [...] positively. Montgomery commented on how simple the song's video was but noted that wasn't a negative, he commented, [...] "like {{pretty much everything}} 3OH!3 do, there's an undeniable charm to both the song and the video. Perhaps it's the power-tool chorus, or the [...] "ooh-ooh-ooh" [...] vocal harmonies. Maybe it's Kesha's sexy ass. Or maybe I just like watching <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> of people lock lips. The whole thing {{is a lot of}} fun. It gets in your head. And hey, it's the summer — school's out, and gleefully stupid is in." ...|$|E
500|$|I've {{been in a}} {{reflective}} state of mind. I've done lot of soul searching and I just felt in a romantic mood when I was writing for [...] so that's what I wrote about... I decided that I {{wanted to work with}} <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> of different producers. [...] Björk's album was one of my favorite for years—it's brilliantly produced. And I also wanted to work with Massive Attack. So obviously, he was on the list. Nellee was the last person I worked with, and it wasn't until then that I got a grip of what the sound of the whole record was, so I had to go back and redo a lot.|$|E

500|$|On March 6, 2014, Big Sean {{released}} his verse {{for the song}} that was cut from the album version of the song. Detailing the song's recording process to MTV, Big Sean said, [...] "Me and [...] was in the studio working on <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> of ideas and [...] came in the conversation. And everybody know Rick Ross albums is events. So Ye pulled a track up, and I was telling him I think it's a banger, it's a smash, and he thought we should give it to Rozay.

500|$|Later in 2010 when {{recording}} {{her third}} album, Here I Am (2011), Rowland credited both Guetta {{and the song}} for inspiring her to pursue a new sound. Rowland relates: [...] "I spent about a year {{of my life in}} Europe really listening to <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> of Europeans DJs and hearing dance music a lot on the radio and really loving it. 'When Love Takes Over' it was my first introduction to dance music [...] it was a whole other monster. It's really a culture and I love it." [...] In 2010, following the success of [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] and the duo's musical chemistry, Guetta was asked to work on Rowland's third studio album. He co-produced a couple of the songs including the album's first single, [...] "Commander".|$|E
500|$|In January 2010, Kevin Greutert, {{who made}} his directorial debut with the sixth film, {{was about to begin}} work on Paramount's Paranormal Activity 2 when Twisted Pictures {{suddenly}} dismissed Hackl and forced Greutert on the project by exercising a [...] "contractual clause" [...] in his contract, much to Greutert's dismay. When Greutert arrived on set two weeks before filming began, he performed a [...] "compressive re-write" [...] of the script. [...] Melton explained that, [...] "He has a lot of ideas, but it's a bit hard and extreme to implement all of these ideas because sets have been built, people have been cast, props have been bought or created, and with the Saw films they are so specific in set design because of the traps. It becomes very problematic and difficult to change things <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> {{right in the middle of}} it".|$|E

Huh!

500|$|Sandra Harding {{says that}} the [...] "moral and {{political}} insights of the women's movement have inspired social scientists and biologists to raise critical questions about the ways traditional researchers have explained gender, sex and relations within and between the social and natural worlds." [...] Some feminists, such as Ruth Hubbard and Evelyn Fox Keller, criticize traditional scientific discourse as being historically biased towards a male perspective. A part of the feminist research agenda is {{the examination of the}} ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in scientific and academic institutions. Physicist Lisa Randall, appointed to a task force at Harvard by then-president Lawrence Summers after his controversial discussion of why women may be underrepresented in science and engineering, said, [...] "I just want to see <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> more women enter the field so these issues don't have to come up anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Here Comes Your Man" [...] was {{released}} {{as a single}} in June 1989, and the song's music video received some airplay on MTV. The cover image, chosen by Francis, comes from a photograph cover designer Simon Larbalestier took of a bulldog terrier for a gallery showing. The Pixies rarely played [...] "Here Comes Your Man" [...] at concerts or at promotional events. Music writer Ben Sisario described this stance as [...] "vintage college-rock 'tude--the hit, the pop song, should be avoided as inauthentic, while the aggro, anticommercial song represents legitimacy." [...] Ivo Watts-Russell stated if Black Francis had been possibly persuaded to release the version of the song recorded during the session for the [...] "Gigantic" [...] single—which he described as [...] "totally streamlined and ready for radio"—that [...] "maybe if a major label company was able to convince people {{to take a more}} commercial route, maybe Pixies would have sold <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> more records than they did. But those steps were just not required back in 1989". The song reached number three on the U.S. Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.|$|E
500|$|In January 1998, 16-year-old Mario Padilla and his 14-year-old cousin, Samuel Ramirez stabbed Mario's mother, Gina Castillo, 45 times, killing her. The case {{became known}} as the [...] "Scream murder" [...] and fell under intense media {{scrutiny}} after the boys claimed they were inspired by Scream and Scream 2. The pair confessed to needing the money acquired from Gina's murder to fund a killing spree, which would include purchasing two Ghostface costumes, as well as a voice-changer used by the character in the film. During their trial, psychologist Madeline Levine who studied the effect of violence on children, stated, [...] "There were <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> of reasons why they acted out that way. But did the movie provide a blueprint? Absolutely." [...] The case was expected to highlight the effect of violent films on teenagers. [...] However, presiding judge John Cheroske ordered that evidence pertaining to Scream be barred and that the case not be referred to as the [...] "Scream murder", refusing media access to the courtroom, intending that the case was tried as murder and nothing else.|$|E

50|$|The {{latest of}} O'Brian's many novels of the sea, {{this is an}} {{intriguing}} story about an early 19th-century British ship as it voyages through the South China Sea. On their way back from concluding a treaty with a local potentate, Captain Jack Aubrey and his crew go {{through a series of}} adventures, including shipwreck and a battle with a French frigate. They end up amidst the cruelty of Botany Bay, the penal colony in New South Wales. The crew are, on the <b>whole,</b> <b>a</b> dignified <b>bunch,</b> and some of the characters are very well drawn, including Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, the ship's Irish doctor and naturalist. Some of the best parts of the book are the descriptions of the flora and fauna of the area, and O'Brian certainly knows his stuff about 19th-century seamanship (although landlubber readers may find themselves confused by some of the technical terminology). Recommended for public libraries.|$|R
500|$|The {{writing process}} {{consumed}} approximately six months, including three months creating notes and analyzing the novel. Zaillian noted that as time progressed, the writing accelerated. [...] "As {{soon as you}} start making decisions," [...] he explained, [...] "you start cutting off {{all of the other}} possibilities of things that could happen. [...] So with every decision that you make you are removing <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> of other possibilities of where that story can go or what that character can do." [...] Given the book's sizable length, Zaillian deleted elements to match Fincher's desired running time. Even so, Zaillan took significant departures from the book. To Zaillian, there was always a [...] "low-grade" [...] anxiety, [...] "but I was never doing anything specifically to please or displease," [...] he continued. [...] "I was simply trying to tell the story the best way I could, and push that out of my mind. I didn't change anything {{just for the sake of}} changing it. There's a lot right about the book, but that part, I thought we could do it a different way, and it could be a nice surprise for the people that have read it." ...|$|E
500|$|Rob Zombie's contribution, Werewolf Women of the SS, starred Nicolas Cage as Fu Manchu; Udo Kier as Franz Hess, {{the commandant}} of Death Camp 13; Zombie's wife, Sheri; and Sybil Danning as SS officers/sisters Eva and Gretchen Krupp (The She-Devils of Belzac). Professional wrestlers Andrew [...] "Test" [...] Martin and Oleg [...] "Vladimir Kozlov" [...] Prudius also featured, plus Olja Hrustic, Meriah Nelson, and Lorielle New as the Werewolf Women. According to Zombie, [...] "Basically, I had two ideas. It was {{either going to}} be a Nazi movie or a women-in-prison film, and I went with the Nazis. There're all those movies like Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS; Fräulein Devil; and Love Camp 7—I've always found that to be the most bizarre genre." [...] Zombie is also quoted as saying [...] "I was getting very {{conceptual}} in my own mind with it. [...] A lot of times these movies would be made like, 'Well, you know, I've got <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> of Nazi uniforms, but I got this Chinese set too. We'll put 'em together!' They start jamming things in there, so I took that approach." ...|$|E
500|$|Waters was an {{aspiring}} filmmaker, intent on making [...] "the trashiest motion pictures in cinema history". Many of his friends, a group {{which came to}} be known as [...] "the Dreamlanders" [...] (and who included Divine, Lochary, Mary Vivian Pearce and Mink Stole), appeared in some of his low-budget productions, filmed on Sunday afternoons. Following the production of his first short film, Hag in a Black Leather Jacket (1964), Waters began production of a second work, Roman Candles (1966). This film was influenced by the pop artist Andy Warhol's Chelsea Girls (1966), and consisted of three 8-millimeter movies played simultaneously side by side. Roman Candles was the first film to star Divine, in this instance in drag as a smoking nun. It featured the Dreamlanders modeling shoplifted clothes and performing various unrelated activities. Being both a short film and of an avant-garde nature, Roman Candles never received widespread distribution, instead holding its premier at the annual Mt. Vernon Flower Mart in Baltimore, which had become popular with [...] "elderly dames, young faggots and hustlers, and of course <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> of hippies". Waters went on to screen it at several local venues alongside Kenneth Anger's short film Eaux d'Artifice (1953).|$|E
