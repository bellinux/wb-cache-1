25|$|According to AI, on June 16, a {{military}} tribunal sentenced Fernando Kutino and two colleagues to 20 years following a brief trial. Kutino was originally charged with incitement to hatred after a May speech {{critical of the}} president; following the speech, broadcast by a radio station owned by Kutino's church, armed assailants in civilian clothes destroyed and looted the station's equipment on May 22, forcing it off the <b>air.</b> <b>Press</b> freedom NGO Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) alleged that the assailants were police officers. The court changed the charge to illegal possession of firearms, criminal conspiracy, and attempted murder (although the alleged victim refused to implicate Kutino). AI claimed that the court used evidence extracted from Kutino's codefendants under torture, and defense lawyers walked out nine days before the guilty verdict to protest {{the conduct of the}} trial.

500|$|Game Show Network (GSN) {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} <b>air</b> <b>Press</b> Your Luck in September 2001, and high viewership ratings prompted the network to order {{a revival of the}} series. Two pilots were taped on February 13, 2002: one with original Press Your Luck host Peter Tomarken and the other hosted by Todd Newton. Newton was ultimately chosen to host the show. Tomarken explained that he was asked to change his style of hosting, saying, [...] "It was terribly hurtful and I think I was doomed before I did [...] I remember being told, 'No, no. Be nice. Be sure everybody likes you.' I took that advice with the pilot. I made the same mistake." [...] Tomarken also acknowledged that GSN wanted to employ a younger host in an effort to attract a younger audience.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{measurement}} testing setup of {{the characteristic}} properties for high temperature superconducting bearing (HTSB) systems is introduced in this paper. The equipment setup can measure the radial and axial forces, temperature, oscillation and rotary {{speed of the}} HTSB simultaneously, so the relation between these properties can be investigated. For example, the decrease of the radial and axial forces, and the increase of the temperature can be measured and analyzed during different rotary speeds of the permanent magnetic rotor. The measurement ranges for the radial and axial force will reach 5 kN and 10 kN. The temperature of the superconductors in HTSB can then be controlled by adjusting the <b>air</b> <b>press</b> inside the dewar which is an easier method compared with a cryocooler...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a parametric {{study on the}} effects of how damage arrestment devices application interacts with a fastener in a composite sandwich panel. The primary objective of the damage arrestment device was to prevent the failure of the composite face sheet, such as crack propagation, around the hole/fastener joint. The damage arrestment devices are made of composite strips that are inserted under the face sheet to increase the overall structural strength of the panel and to prevent the propagation of failure along the hole. This {{was supposed to be a}} quicker and stronger alternative to potted inserts for composite sandwich panels for designer. The manufacturing curing cycle of the composite sandwich specimens has been carried out by using a Tetrahedron Composite <b>Air</b> <b>Press.</b> The press has been used to fabricate composite sandwich panels by applying constant pressure and variable heat to create panels with dimensions of 5 ” x 2 ” x. 552 ”. The panels were stacked using a polyurethane foam, Last-A-Foam FR- 6710 with two layers of a carbon-fiber/epoxy weave, LTM 45, on both sides of the foam. The specimens were loaded under a compressive strain of 0. 5 mm/min. The damage arrestment devices’ thickness was varied and tested under both monotonic and fatigue loading. 	 The experimental results indicate that as the thickness of the device increased the overall strength of the part increased at a parabolic curve with it topping at a thickness of 0. 065 ” and a strength increase of 109 %. Under fatigue loading, a control group test case and damage arrestment device configuration case was tested. The experimental results indicate that both cases have similar fatigue trends but shows that the damage arrestment specimens are stronger due to the increase of structural strength. 	 The experimental results were compared with numerical results or Finite Element Model. The results showed that numerical results can capture the linear or elastic portion of the experimental results having identical Elastic Modulus values. The models do differ in the maximum displacement of the specimen and the failure mode around the hole of the composite sandwich panel. The discrepancy in displacement and the failure mode was attributed to inaccurate loading on the hole of the composite sandwich panel and non-linear modeling of the solution. The correlation between the FEM and the experimental data was good enough in predicting the trends of the composite sandwich panels...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} effort {{explored the}} possibility of using interwoven conductive and nonconductive fibers in a composite laminate for structural health monitoring (SHM). Traditional SHM systems utilize fiber optics, piezoelectrics, or detect defects by nondestructive test methods by use of sonar graphs or x-rays. However, these approaches are often expensive, time consuming and complicated. The primary objective of this research was to apply a resistance based method of structural health monitoring to a composite structure to determine structural integrity and presence of defects. The conductive properties of fiber such as carbon, copper, or constantan - a copper-nickel alloy - can be utilized as sensors within the structure. This allows the structure to provide feedback via electrical signals to a user which are essential for evaluating the health of the structure. In this research, the conductive fiber was made from constantan wire which was embedded within a composite laminate; whereas prepreg fiberglass, a nonconductive material, serves as the main structural element of the laminate. A composite laminate was constructed from four layers of TenCate 7781 “E” fiberglass and BT 250 E- 1 resin prepreg. Integrating the constantan within the composite laminate provides a sensory element which supplies measurements of structural behavior. Thus, with fiberglass, epoxy, and a constantan conductive element, a three-part composite laminate is developed. Test specimens used in this research were fabricated using a composite <b>air</b> <b>press</b> with the recommended manufacturer cure cycle. A TenCate BT 250 E- 1 Resin System and 7781 2 ̆ 2 E 2 ̆ 2 impregnated glass-fiber/epoxy weave was used. A constantan wire of 0. 01 ” gauge diameter was integrated into the composite structure. The composite laminate specimen with the integrated SHM system was tested under tensile and flexural loads employing test standards specified by ASTM D 3039 and D 7264, respectively. These test methods were modified to determine the behavior of the laminate in the elastic range only. A tension and flexural delamination test case was also developed to investigate the sensitivity of the SHM system to inherent defects. Moreover, material characteristic tests were completed to validate manufacturer provided material characteristics. The specimens were tested while varying the constantan configurations, such as the sensor length and orientation. A variety of techniques to integrate the sensor were also investigated. Two different measurement methods were used to determine strain. Strain measurements were made with Instron Bluehill 2 software and correlated to strain obtained by the structural health monitoring system {{with the use of a}} data acquisition code written to interact with a micro-ohm-meter. The experimental results showed good agreement between measurements made by the two different methods of measurement. Observations discovered that varying the length of the sensor element improved sensitivity, but resulted in different prediction models when compared to cases with less sensor length. The predictions are based on the gauge factor, which was determined for the each test case. This value provides the essential relationship between resistance and strain. Experiments proved that the measured gauge factor depended greatly on the sensor length and orientation. The correlation was of sufficient accuracy to predict strain values in a composite laminate without the use of any added tools or equipment besides the ohm-meter. Analytical solutions to the loading cases were developed to validate results obtained during experiments. The solutions were in good agreement with the experimental results...|$|E
