50|$|Ivy: A quiet, {{intelligent}} {{child who}} loves reading books. She has fiery orange hair and is <b>always</b> <b>wearing</b> a pink, purple, or blue headband. Ivy {{can be described}} as a girly girl since she is <b>always</b> <b>wearing</b> skirts and dresses. Her favorite color is pink.|$|R

25|$|American judges {{frequently}} wear black robes. American {{judges have}} ceremonial gavels, although American judges have court deputies or bailiffs and {{contempt of court}} power as their main devices to maintain decorum in the courtroom. However, {{in some of the}} Western United States, like California, judges did not <b>always</b> <b>wear</b> robes and instead wore everyday clothing. Today, some members of state supreme courts, such as the Maryland Court of Appeals wear distinct dress. In Italy and Portugal, both judges and lawyers wear particular black robes.|$|E

25|$|Haredi {{women wear}} blouses {{covering}} the elbow and collarbone, and skirts {{that cover the}} knees while standing and sitting. The ideal sleeve and skirt length varies by community. Some women try not to follow fashion, while others wear fashionable, but modest, clothing. Haredi women avoid skirts with slits, preferring instead kick-pleats. They also avoid overly eye-catching colors, especially bright red, as well as clothing that is tight. Many will only wear closed-toe shoes, and <b>always</b> <b>wear</b> stockings, the thickness of which varies by community.|$|E
25|$|In the {{universities}} of the UK {{there are days}} called scarlet days or red letter days. On such days, doctors of the university may wear their scarlet 'festal' or full dress gowns instead of their undress ('black') gown. This is more significant for the ancient universities such as Oxford and Cambridge where academic dress is worn almost daily, the black undress gown being worn on normal occasions {{as opposed to the}} bright red gowns. Since most universities have abandoned academic dress to the graduation ceremony (where doctors <b>always</b> <b>wear</b> scarlet), the significance of scarlet days has all but disappeared.|$|E
25|$|According to tradition, Jewish men, {{married or}} not, must cover their heads. The most common head {{covering}} is the kippah (Hebrew: skull cap), known as yarmulke in Yiddish. Orthodox men wear something {{on their heads}} at almost all times, while non-Orthodox men may cover their heads only when performing some religious act, or when eating. Few cover the entire head. Almost all will bathe with the head uncovered, but sleeping varies by community or family practice. The exact nature of this practice, and how binding it is, {{is a matter of}} dispute among halakhic authorities. Wearing a hat is not required by Jewish law, and those who wear a hat <b>always</b> <b>wear</b> a kippah underneath; however, there are some rabbis, especially in Hasidic Judaism, who require a double head covering - of kippah and hat or tallis - during prayer.|$|E

500|$|The von Neumanns, Klara and John, {{were active}} {{socially}} within the Princeton academic community. His white clapboard house at 26 Westcott Road {{was one of}} the largest in Princeton. He took great care over his clothing, and would <b>always</b> <b>wear</b> formal suits, once riding down the Grand Canyon astride a mule in a three-piece pin-stripe. Hilbert is reported to have asked at von Neumann's 1926 doctoral exam: [...] "Pray, who is the candidate's tailor?" [...] as he had never seen such beautiful evening clothes.|$|E
500|$|A {{first year}} student and self proclaimed hoodlum. He <b>always</b> <b>wear</b> a black long coat. He is very {{resilient}} and manages to surprise watchers by battling against the odds. [...] He is the heir of the Demon Exorcist family. His family's supernatural power {{is called the}} Dragon's Fist, which gives them {{the ability to take}} supernatural powers from others and use it as their own. This power is often feared and misunderstood by others which caused Souichiro to be socially rejected. He is actually stronger than Bob.|$|E
500|$|Commercial divers {{refer to}} diving {{operations}} where the diver starts and finishes the diving operation at atmospheric pressure as surface oriented, or bounce diving.

Surface-supplied divers almost <b>always</b> <b>wear</b> diving helmets or full face diving masks.

500|$|Bolton Wanderers' home colours {{are white}} shirts with navy and red trim, {{traditionally}} worn with navy shorts and white socks. Their away kits have been varied over the years, with navy kits and yellow kits {{among the most}} popular and common. Bolton did not <b>always</b> <b>wear</b> the white kit they do today; in 1884 they wore white with red spots, leading to the club's original nickname of [...] "The Spots". The traditional navy blue shorts were dispensed with in 2003, in favour of an all-white strip, but they returned in 2008. The club had previously experimented with an all-white kit in the 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the various}} yell practices, the Aggie Yell Leaders wear either maroon (seniors) or white (juniors) T-shirts and denim {{overalls}} that they decorate with maroon paint, often featuring their graduation year and various {{depictions of the}} A traditions. [...] During sporting events, they <b>always</b> <b>wear</b> a white button-down shirt and white pants.|$|E
2500|$|At this point, MGM began {{trying to}} {{distinguish}} Harlow's public persona from that of her screen characters, changing her childhood surname from common [...] "Carpenter" [...] to chic [...] "Carpentier", claiming that writer Edgar Allan Poe {{was one of her}} ancestors and publishing photographs of Harlow doing charity work to change her image from that of a tramp to an all-American girl. This transformation proved difficult; once, Harlow was heard muttering, [...] "My God, must I <b>always</b> <b>wear</b> a low-cut dress to be important?" ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{are also}} {{alternative}} endings, where verse nine states: [...] "There {{is a moral}} to this tale", and {{is followed by a}} chorus of [...] "Don't go without your hat / Don't go without your hat / On Ilkey moor baht 'at" [...] (which is sung commonly within West Yorkshire), or [...] "Don't go a courtin' Mary Jane" [...] (another variation known in the Scouting movement). [...] Alternatively, verse nine is sung as [...] "There is a moral to this tale", and verse ten as [...] "When courtin' <b>always</b> <b>wear</b> a hat".|$|E
2500|$|F) {{when the}} {{chaperon}} {{needed to be}} removed, in warm weather, or {{in the presence of}} a person much higher in rank (and, usually, in church) it could be put over the shoulder with the patte and cornette hanging on opposite sides, or round the shoulders. [...] Which came forward and which went back varies considerably, but more often the bourrelet went behind. [...] Possibly the chaperon was secured to the shoulder, as the assemblage often looks rather precarious. [...] Donor figures in religious paintings <b>always</b> <b>wear</b> their chaperons in this way, as they are figuratively in the presence of the saints or the Madonna.|$|E

[...] In 1897, the Association moved to orange and maroon to save {{cleaning}} costs. [...] The Cactus Yearbook {{at the time}} listed the University colors as either gold or orange and white until the 1899 Cactus declared the University colors to be gold and maroon. Students at the University's medical branch in Galveston (UTMB) {{were in favor of}} royal blue. [...] By 1899, a UT fan could have worn any of yellow, orange, white, red, maroon, or even blue.|$|E
