50|$|ASPS is an {{extremely}} rare cancer. While sarcomas comprise about 1% of all newly diagnosed cancers, and 15% of all childhood cancers, ASPS comprises less than 1% of sarcomas. According to the American Cancer Society, about 9530 new cases of soft tissue sarcoma will be diagnosed in the USA in 2006. This predicts under 100 new cases of ASPS.

40|$|During {{the night}} {{turbulence}} {{can often be}} very intermittent, occurring in sudden vigorous bursts after prolonged periods of low-intensity. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain intermittency. The present study focuses {{on the role of}} porous surface elements, which influence the mean wind profile near the surface and therefore the shear characteristics. The shape of this profile plays a vital role in the mechanism that causes the flow to destabilize. Direct numerical simulations of a pressure driven stably stratified flow are used to study the development of initial instabilities into breaking waves and the possibility of a subsequent collapse of turbulence and return to a weakly turbulent state. To better understand the parameter space associated with the occurrence of intermittency, we conduct a linear stability analysis which provides critical values for the Richardson number in relation to the canopy characteristics. This enables one to make <b>an</b> a-priori <b>educated</b> <b>guess</b> of the conditions that favor intermittency, which are subsequently studied in more detail using the DN...|$|R

50|$|Empiric {{therapy or}} {{empirical}} therapy is therapy {{based on experience}} and, more specifically, therapy begun {{on the basis of}} <b>a</b> clinical <b>educated</b> <b>guess</b> in the absence of complete or perfect information. Thus it is applied before the confirmation of a definitive diagnosis or in the absence of complete understanding of mechanism, whether the biological mechanism of pathogenesis or the therapeutic mechanism of action. The name shares the same stem with empirical evidence, involving an idea of practical experience. Empiric therapy is most often used when antibiotics are given to a person before the specific bacterium causing an infection is known. Fighting an infection sooner rather than later is important to minimize morbidity, risk, and complications, so there is value in getting started with good information rather than waiting around for better information. Examples of this include antibiotics given for pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and suspected bacterial meningitis in newborns aged 0 to 6 months. Empiric antibiotic therapy thus may be thought of as taking the initiative against an anticipated and likely cause of infectious disease.|$|R
30|$|Our {{discussion}} {{emphasizes that}} it is hard to choose an optimal polynomial recovery strategy, mainly due to the fact that one can either optimize the decoding time or the success probability but not both (unless a predefined trade-off between the two criteria can be selected). From our discussion, we have chosen the final decoding strategy from experimental observations and <b>a</b> final <b>educated</b> <b>guess.</b> However, it must be stressed that a Guruswami-Sudan strategy is not necessarily the best strategy. For example, whenever one wants to successfully decode even if ω=k, then the iterated Lagrange strategy is optimal, and if ω≥(u+k)/ 2, then the Reed-Solomon decoding strategy yields to the best decoder. It seems therefore reasonable to develop a dynamic decoder switching between different strategies depending on the expected values for ω given u and k. This is an interesting topic; the analysis of which we leave open for future research. The reader should be aware of the fact that from an attacker’s point of view, other strategies can be much more efficient—e.g. strategies that employ the statistics of the protected features as, for example, a false-accept attack.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade great efforts {{have been made to}} {{efficiently}} study the behaviors of rare-event systems.

The work contained here is directed at further development of one of these sets of methods and theories. Specifically, a new theory of dynamics in the Langevin path space is developed with emphasis on generating and sampling Langevin trajectories that exhibit rare transitions. The quest to formulate path dynamics or path sampling is not new. Rather, this work offers a new formulation of an old idea while keeping in mind two key issues: first, whatever theory and methods are developed they should be accessible to those simply seeking methods and easy to implement, since the goal is application to complex, large dimensional systems.

40|$|We {{consider}} SUSY-like {{events with}} two decay chains, each terminating in an invisible particle, whose true energy and momentum are not {{measured in the}} detector. Nevertheless, <b>a</b> useful <b>educated</b> <b>guess</b> about the invisible momenta can still be obtained by optimizing a suitable invariant mass function. We review and contrast several proposals in the literature for such ansatze: four versions of the M_T 2 -assisted on-shell reconstruction (MAOS), {{as well as several}} variants of the on-shell constrained M_ 2 variables. We compare the performance of these methods with regards to the mass determination of a new particle resonance along the decay chain from the peak of the reconstructed invariant mass distribution. For concreteness, we consider the event topology of dilepton ttbar events and study each of the three possible subsystems, in both a ttbar and a SUSY example. We find that the M_ 2 variables generally provide sharper peaks and therefore better ansatze for the invisible momenta. We show that the performance can be further improved by preselecting events near the kinematic endpoint of the corresponding variable from which the momentum ansatz originates.

However, humans are often able to interpret novel word forms (that is, words they have not seen before) without difficulty.

40|$|This chapter {{deals with}} the problem of {{answering}} a keyword query over a relational database. To do so, one needs to understand the meaning of the keywords in the query, “guess” its possible semantics, and materialize them as SQL queries that can be executed directly on the relational database. The focus of the chapter is on techniques that do not require any prior access to the instance data, making them suitable for sources behind wrappers or Web interfaces or, in general, for sources that disallow prior access to their data in order to construct an index. The chapter describes two techniques that use semantic information and metadata from the sources, alongside the query itself, in order to achieve that. Apart from understanding the semantics of the keywords themselves, the techniques are also exploiting the order and the proximity of the keywords in the query to make <b>a</b> more <b>educated</b> <b>guess.</b> The first approach is based on an extension of the Hungarian algorithm for identifying the data structures having the maximum likelihood to contain the user keywords. In the second approach, the problem of associating keywords into data structures of the relational source is modeled by means of a hidden Markov model, and the Viterbi algorithm is exploited for computing the mappings.

40|$|Further {{improvements}} on {{the novel}} method for state of charge (SOC) determination of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells based on the impedance spectra classification are presented. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is applied to impedance spectra of a LFP cell, with each impedance spectrum representing a distinct SOC for a predefined temperature. As a SVM is a binary classifier, only the distinction between two SOC can be computed in one iteration of the algorithm. Therefore a search pattern is necessary. A balanced tree search was implemented with good results. In order to further improvements of the SVM method, this paper discusses two new search pattern, namely a linear search and an imbalanced tree search, the later one based on <b>an</b> initial <b>educated</b> <b>guess.</b> All three search pattern were compared under various aspects like accuracy, efficiency, tolerance of disturbances and temperature dependancy. The imbalanced search tree shows {{to be the most}} efficient search pattern if the initial guess is within less than ± 5  % SOC of the original SOC in both directions and exhibits the best tolerance for high disturbances. Linear search improves the rate of exact classifications for almost every temperature. It also improves the robustness against high disturbances and can even detect a certain number of false classifications which makes this search pattern unique. The downside is a much lower efficiency as all impedance spectra have to be evaluated while the tree search pattern only evaluate those on the tree path...|$|R

A study done in western New York examined the river chub, or Nocomis micropogon. The main predators for small river fish such as this are other bigger fish and birds.
