40|$|Radiolabelled assays and compound-specific {{stable isotope}} {{analysis}} (CSIA) {{were used to}} assess methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) biodegradation in an unleaded fuel plume in a UK chalk aquifer, both in the field and in laboratory microcosm experiments. The (14) C-MTBE radiorespirometry studies demonstrated widespread potential for aerobic and anaerobic MTBE biodegradation in the aquifer. However, delta(13) C compositions of MTBE in groundwater samples from the plume showed no significant (13) C enrichment that would indicate MTBE biodegradation at the field scale. Carbon isotope enrichment during MTBE biodegradation was assessed in the microcosms when dissolved O(2) was not limiting, compared with low in situ concentrations (2 mg/L) in the aquifer, {{and in the absence of}} O(2). The microcosm experiments showed ubiquitous potential for <b>aerobic</b> MTBE <b>biodegradation</b> in the aquifer within hundreds of days. <b>Aerobic</b> MTBE <b>biodegradation</b> in the microcosms produced an enrichment of 7 parts per thousand in the MTBE delta(13) C composition and an isotope enrichment factor (epsilon) of 1. 53 parts per thousand when dissolved O(2) was not limiting. However, for the low dissolved O(2) concentration of up to 2 mg/L that characterizes most of the MTBE plume fringe, <b>aerobic</b> MTBE <b>biodegradation</b> produced an enrichment of 0. 5 - 0. 7 parts per thousand, corresponding to an epsilon value of - 0. 22 parts per thousand to - 0. 24 parts per thousand. No anaerobic MTBE biodegradation occurred under these experimental conditions. These results suggest the existence of a complex MTBE-biodegrading community in the aquifer, which may consist of different aerobic species competing for MTBE and dissolved O(2). Under low O(2) conditions, the lower fractionating species have been shown to govern overall MTBE C-isotope fractionation during biodegradation, confirming the results of previous laboratory experiments mixing pure cultures. This implies that significant <b>aerobic</b> MTBE <b>biodegradation</b> could occur under the low dissolved O(2) concentration that typifies the reactive fringe zone of MTBE plumes, without producing detectable changes in the MTBE delta(13) C composition. This observed insensitivity of C isotope enrichment to MTBE biodegradation could lead to significant underestimation of <b>aerobic</b> MTBE <b>biodegradation</b> at field scale, with an unnecessarily pessimistic performance assessment for natural attenuation. Site-specific C isotope enrichment factors are, therefore, required to reliably quantify MTBE biodegradation, which may limit CSIA as a tool for the in situ assessment of MTBE biodegradation in groundwater using only C isotopes.

In this study, carbon and hydrogen isotopic fractionation effects during biodegradation of benzene under anaerobic conditions with different terminal-electron-accepting processes are reported for the first time. Different enrichment factors (ɛ) for carbon (range of − 1. 9 to − 3. 6 ‰) and hydrogen (range of − 29 to − 79 ‰) fractionation were observed during biodegradation of benzene under nitrate-reducing, sulfate-reducing, and methanogenic conditions.

NAs are ubiquitous; occurring naturally in hydrocarbon deposits (petroleum, oil sands, bitumen, and crude oils) and also have widespread industrial uses.

However, the diversity of microbial communities involved in NA-degradation, and the mechanisms by which NAs are biodegraded, are poorly understood.

40|$|Ethanol {{can affect}} the {{biodegradation}} of gasoline hydrocarbons in groundwater. High concentrations of ethanol can be toxic to subsurface microorganisms that are otherwise capable of degrading hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX). At lower concentrations, ethanol may hinder BTEX degradation through substrate competition and the depletion of inorganic nutrients (e. g., nitrogen and phosphorus), oxygen and other electron acceptors needed for BTEX degradation. A series of laboratory experiments were designed to study the effect of ethanol on aquifer microorganisms and on <b>aerobic</b> BTEX <b>biodegradation.</b> A microcosm experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of ethanol on the biodegradation of BTEX. Microcosms were set up with Borden aquifer material and groundwater in which oxygen and nutrients were not limited. These microcosms contained BTEX in combination {{with a range of}} ethanol concentrations. Under these favourable conditions, the presence of ethanol up to concentrations of 1. 9 % (v/v) (equivalent to 15000 mg/L) caused little inhibition of BTEX degradation. Further experiments were conducted to study the antimicrobial effects of higher concentrations of ethanol. Following exposure to ethanol concentrations of 25 % (v/v) or higher, microbial activity and survival was significantly diminished. Results suggest that a high concentration ethanol slug will {{have a major impact on}} the microbial community but that there would likely be potential for recovery. The recovery potential was examined further in laboratory column experiments designed to simulate a dynamic field situation where a high ethanol pulse is followed by a BTEX plume. These column experiments were conducted with Borden aquifer material and groundwater under aerobic conditions. The concentration of the ethanol pulse was 25 % (v/v), which was expected to significantly alter the microbial population without destroying it. Following the ethanol exposure, groundwater and BTEX were allowed to flow through one column to simulate the reinoculation of microorganisms from upgradient groundwater advecting into the contaminated zone. The other column was fed with sterile groundwater and BTEX to evaluate the regeneration of within-column microorganisms that survived the ethanol exposure. Recovery in both columns was rapid. Unfortunately, during the recovery phase, sterility of the influent groundwater could not be maintained. As a result, recovery by regeneration could not be evaluated. Nonetheless, it is evident that recovery in terms of <b>aerobic</b> BTEX <b>biodegradation</b> was significant under the conditions of the column experiment.

40|$|Naphthenic acids (NAs) are carboxylated alkanes and cycloalkanes {{concentrated}} in wastewater during oil sands processing. The general chemical formula is C{n}H{n+Z}O{ 2 }, where n represents {{the number of}} carbon atoms and Z specifies a homologous family with 0 - 6 rings (Z= 0 to Z=- 12). The wastewater is acutely toxic to surface water organisms and is stored in tailings ponds with over 230 million m³ of fines tailings and free water. The purpose of this thesis {{was to provide a}} preliminary evaluation of the potential attenuation of NAs during groundwater flow from the ponds. Laboratory studies were conducted to evaluate possible attenuation mechanisms. Aerobes from aquifer material degraded 60 % of the NAs over 20 weeks in laboratory microcosms. The greatest decrease occurred in the low molecular weight bicyclic homologues with 12 to 16 carbons. The microbial activity confirms that aerobic naphthenate-degrading bacteria occur naturally in the glacial aquifer near Suncor's Pond 2 / 3. These results support the hypothesis that limited <b>aerobic</b> <b>biodegradation</b> of the smaller components of NAs could occur relatively rapidly under field conditions. There was no measurable decrease in NA concentration over six months in anaerobic microcosms, although microbial activity did lead to sulfate-reducing and methanogenic conditions. The theoretical retardation in glacio-fluvial sands was calculated using soil-water partitioning coefficients (K{d}) determined by batch equilibration experiments using a mixture of naturally occurring naphthenic acids as well as the nine surrogates. The retardation (porosity of 0. 3, bulk density of 1. 5 g/mL) ranged from 1. 2 to 2. 6. However, no measurable sorption was seen at the field sites. Detailed characterization allows us to examine how the proportions of homologue, or groups of molecules with the same molecular weight and number of cycloalkane rings, vary. <b>Aerobic</b> <b>biodegradation</b> favoured removal of low molecular weight NAs. A 15 % mass loss attributed to sorption caused no changes in the 3 D signature. Thus, changes in NA "signature" in groundwater systems were then attributed to <b>aerobic</b> <b>biodegradation.</b> Three plumes were examined for evidence of attenuation of NAs via biodegradation. First, the individual samples were classified as background, possibly process-affected or process-affected using a combination of Piper diagrams, the stable isotopes oxygen- 18 and deuterium, dissolved chloride and sodium, as well as the total naphthenic acids concentration. Second, in order to estimate attenuation due to dispersive dilution, a linear correlation line was drawn between various conservative tracers and the naphthenic acids concentration. This allowed the identification of certain samples as possibly having a lower concentration of NAs than could be expected from simple dispersive dilution. Third, the 3 D signature of certain samples were examined for the presence of the <b>aerobic</b> <b>biodegradation</b> 3 D signature.

The {{aim of this study}} was to identify members of the Pseudomonas species from oil-polluted soil, investigate their diversity and compare it to phytopatogenic strains isolated from host-plants near marked site. Isolates were described phenotypically according to carbon assimilation, fluorescence on King B medium and susceptibility patterns to 5 different heavy metals. In addition, they were characterized genotypically using plasmid profile and fingerprints obtained with the (GTG) 5 primer. We have observed high heterogeneity within the Pseudomonas strains collected from oil- contaminated soils. Phenotyping and (GTG) 5 pattern showed that similarities between strains ranged from 55...|$|R
40|$|Aerobic {{bacteria}} that grow on vinyl chloride (VC) have been isolated previously, but their diversity and distribution are largely unknown. It is also unclear whether such bacteria {{contribute to the}} natural attenuation of VC at chlorinated-ethene-contaminated sites. We detected <b>aerobic</b> VC <b>biodegradation</b> in 23 of 37 microcosms and enrichments inoculated with samples from various sites. Twelve different bacteria (11 Mycobacterium strains and 1 Nocardioides strain) capable of growth on VC as the sole carbon source were isolated, and 5 representative strains were examined further. All the isolates grew on ethene in addition to VC and contained VC-inducible ethene monooxygenase activity. The Mycobacterium strains (JS 60, JS 61, JS 616, and JS 617) all had similar growth yields (5. 4 to 6. 6 g of protein/mol), maximum specific growth rates (0. 17 to 0. 23 day− 1), and maximum specific substrate utilization rates (9 to 16 nmol/min/mg of protein) with VC. The Nocardioides strain (JS 614) had a higher growth yield (10. 3 g of protein/mol), growth rate (0. 71 day− 1), and substrate utilization rate (43 nmol/min/mg of protein) with VC but was much more sensitive to VC starvation. Half-velocity constant (Ks) values for VC were between 0. 5 and 3. 2 μM, while Ks values for oxygen ranged from 0. 03 to 0. 3 mg/liter. Our results indicate that aerobic VC-degrading microorganisms (predominantly Mycobacterium strains) are widely distributed at sites contaminated with chlorinated solvents {{and are likely to}} be responsible for the natural attenuation of VC...|$|R
40|$|Understanding prokaryotic {{transformation}} of recalcitrant pollutants and the in-situ metabolic nets require {{the integration of}} massive amounts of biological data. Decades of biochemical studies together with novel next-generation sequencing data have exponentially increased information on aerobic aromatic degradation pathways. However, the majority of protein sequences in public databases have not been experimentally characterized and homology-based methods are still the most routinely used approach to assign protein function, allowing the propagation of misannotations. AromaDeg is a web-based resource targeting aerobic degradation of aromatics that comprises recently updated (September 2013) and manually curated databases constructed based on a phylogenomic approach. Grounded in phylogenetic analyses of protein sequences of key catabolic protein families and of proteins of documented function, AromaDeg allows query and data mining of novel genomic, metagenomic or metatranscriptomic data sets. Essentially, each query sequence that match a given protein family of AromaDeg is associated to a specific cluster of a given phylogenetic tree and further function annotation and/or substrate specificity may be inferred from the neighboring cluster members with experimentally validated function. This allows a detailed characterization of individual protein superfamilies as well as high-throughput functional classifications. Thus, AromaDeg addresses the deficiencies of homology-based protein function prediction, combining phylogenetic tree construction and integration of experimental data to obtain more accurate annotations of new biological data related to <b>aerobic</b> aromatic <b>biodegradation</b> pathways. We pursue in future the expansion of AromaDeg to other enzyme families involved in aromatic degradation and its regular update. Database URL: [URL]...|$|R
