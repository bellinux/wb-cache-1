Analysis of vibration related phenomena is a solution commonly applied in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems.

Both patients required extensive investigation culminating in identifying lymph nodes amenable to biopsy under endobronchial ultrasound guidance. It was not until both patients received anti-tuberculous chemotherapy alongside anti-arrhythmic management that any improvement to their condition was witnessed. Therefore, we recommend that the clinician should have a high index of suspicion for TB in any patient presenting with a broad-complex tachycardia that is not responding to standard first line management, especially if the patient is from a high risk background.

Abundant human plasma proteins were removed by immunodepletion. Depleted plasma samples were then digested to peptides with trypsin, fractionated by basic reversed phase and each fraction analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This sample processing and analysis method enabled identification of low levels of trypanosome proteins in pooled plasma from late stage sleeping sickness patients infected with Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense.

Therefore, the TS results for ne and Te can be used to calibrate passive diagnostic methods which are often based on plasma models.

40|$|Migration technique, {{which is}} {{normally}} used in geophysical prospecting, is proposed {{to locate and}} image multiple delamination damages in a laminated composite plate. In this simulation study, an <b>active</b> <b>diagnostic</b> system with a linear array of actuators/sensors is used to excite/receive the lowest mode of flexural waves in the laminate. The wavefield scattered from the damages and sensor array data are synthesized using a two-dimensional explicit finite difference scheme to model wave propagation in the laminate based on the Mindlin plate theory. A prestack reverse-time migration technique is then adopted to interpret the synthetic sensor array data and to visualize the damages. The phase and group velocities of flexural waves in the composite plate are derived from the dispersion relations, and subsequently an excitation-time imaging condition specifically for migration of waves in the plate is introduced based on ray tracing and group velocity. Then the prestack reverse-time migration is performed using the same finite difference scheme to back-propagate the scattered energy to the damages. During the migration process, the laminate is imaged in terms of velocity of the transverse deformation. The locations and dimensions of the damages can be visually displayed. Simulated results demonstrate that multiple delamination damages can be successfully identified and the resulting image correlates well with the target damages.

We studied site-specific liver and biliary cancers in first-generation immigrants to Sweden with an aim to search for aetiological clues and to find evidence for indigenous incidence rates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used the nation-wide Swedish Family-Cancer Database to calculate standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) in immigrants compared to native Swedes. RESULTS: A total of 1428 cancers were identified in immigrants whose median ages (years) at immigration were 27 for men and 26 for women and whose median diagnostic ages were 64 and 66, respectively. The highest SIRs of 6. 7 for primary liver cancer were observed for men from East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Increased SIRs were recorded for male immigrants from previous Yugoslavia (1. 78), Southern Europe (2. 91), Turkey (2. 15) and Asian Arab countries (2. 89). For gallbladder cancer, only women from the Indian subcontinent (3. 84) and Chile (2. 34) had increased risk while some Northern European immigrants showed decreased risks. CONCLUSIONS: Primary liver cancer was increased in immigrants from endemic regions of hepatitis B virus infection but also from large regions lacking cancer incidence data, North Africa, Asian Arab countries, Turkey and previous Yugoslavia; these are probably intermediary risk regions for this infection. The consideration of these regions as risk areas would justify <b>active</b> <b>diagnostic</b> and vaccination programs.

The {{aim is to}} solve the self-coordinated {{problems}} and to analyse the basic factors influencing on the space amplification and light absorption in the electric-discharged CO* 002 -lasers. The self-coordinated description of processes in the active media of technological lasers has been represented. The decrease of Gauss mode amplification by a volumetric recombination and also the diffusion of the excitated molecules {{as a source of}} additional amplification have been shown. The application package developed was used for interpretation of the experiments on the <b>active</b> media <b>diagnostics.</b> The methods for measurement of the turbulent diffusion coefficient according to the amplification (absorption) of Gauss beam have been proposed.

Four key issues are presented including optimization of spectral instrumentation, feasibility of a motional Stark effect (MSE) evaluation based on line ratios, "first-mirror" test-bed experiments at the tokamak TEXTOR, and finally the role of integrated data analysis for the conceptual layout of the change exchange recombination spectroscopy and MSE diagnostic.
