5|$|Ebla's first kingdom is {{an example}} of early Syrian {{centralized}} states, and {{is considered one of the}} earliest empires by scholars, such as Samuel Finer, and Karl Moore, who consider it the first-recorded world power.

5|$|Musicians {{and critics}} {{vary in their}} {{appraisal}} of Tristano as a musician. Some describe his playing as cold and suggest that his innovations had little impact; others state that he was <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>between</b> bebop and later, freer forms of jazz, and assert that he is less appreciated than he should be because commentators found him hard to categorize and because {{he chose not to}} commercialize.|$|E
5|$|One central {{coenzyme}} is {{adenosine triphosphate}} (ATP), the universal energy currency of cells. This nucleotide {{is used to}} transfer chemical energy between different chemical reactions. There {{is only a small}} amount of ATP in cells, but as it is continuously regenerated, the human body can use about its own weight in ATP per day. ATP acts as <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>between</b> catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism breaks down molecules, and anabolism puts them together. Catabolic reactions generate ATP, and anabolic reactions consume it. It also serves as a carrier of phosphate groups in phosphorylation reactions.|$|E

Its shape and façade are response to Azerbaijan's special {{request for the}} creation of a widely visible and visually effective landmark as <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>between</b> Asia and Europe that will be noticed in an international context. The LED lights were upgraded to allow different dynamic lighting scenarios to appear in order to highlight the membrane façade and create moods appropriate for the different stages of the events.|$|E

5|$|There were {{repeated}} attempts by some Polish academics and philosophers, many {{related to the}} prewar Lwów–Warsaw school – such as Leszek Kołakowski, Stanisław Ossowski and Adam Schaff – to develop a specific form of Polish Marxism. Their attempts to create <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>between</b> Poland's history and Marxist ideology were mildly successful, although stifled due to the regime's unwillingness to risk {{the wrath of the}} Soviet Union for deviating too far from the Soviet party line. Kołakowski, a leading revisionist, was verbally attacked by Gomułka in 1957, expelled from the party in 1966 and in 1968 had to emigrate.|$|E

5|$|By 1892, Imaginos {{is living}} in a mansion in Cornwall and has a nine-year-old granddaughter.

Some fans see Les Invisibles' actions in favour of England against Spain as a sort of vengeance for the extermination by the conquistadores of their worshippers in Central America, while others view their intervention as only part of the mysterious scheme carried on by the alien entities through the centuries ("In the Presence of Another World").|$|E

5|$|From 1927, Lee was {{actively}} {{involved with the}} SCCCI, initially as General-Secretary, then as President. Under his leadership, the SCCCI supported the establishment of Nanyang University and convinced the British to grant citizenship to Chinese immigrants {{who had lived in}} Singapore for eight years. Lee was Chairman of the Ee Hoe Hean Club from 1933–1935 and 1941–1945. Lee was also one of six Hokkien representatives in the Overseas Chinese Association (OCA), which acted as <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>between</b> the Chinese community and Japanese military administration during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. During an OCA assignment to the Endau Settlement in Malaysia, his convoy was ambushed by the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army and everyone in the convoy was shot. Only Lee survived, as a bullet hit a Buddhist medallion on his chest; this inspired him to spread Buddhism in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|The Arp2/3 {{complex is}} {{composed}} of seven subunits: Arp2, Arp3, p41/ARPC1, p34/ARPC2, p21/ARPC3, p20/ARPC4, p16/ARPC5. The subunits Arp2 & Arp3 closely resemble monomeric actin allowing for a thermodynamically stable actin-like dimer. p41 has been proposed to interact with nucleation promoting factors (NPFs) because it is only known to have minor contacts with the mother filament {{and there is a}} major loss of nucleation efficiency in the absence of p41. p34 and p20 dimerize to form a structural backbone that mediates the interaction with the mother filament. p21 forms <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>between</b> Arp3 and the mother filament, increasing nucleation efficiency. p16 tethers Arp2 {{to the rest of the}} complex.|$|E
5|$|The communists' {{principal}} rivals {{were the}} veterans of the Armia Krajowa movement, Mikołajczyk's Polish People's (Peasant) Party (Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe; PSL), and {{the veterans of}} the Polish armies which had fought in the West. Of particular practical importance was Mikołajczyk's People's Party, because it was legally recognized by the communists and thus able to function within the political arena. The People's Party wanted to prevent the communists from monopolizing power and eventually establish a parliamentary polity with a market economy by winning the promised elections. Mikołajczyk hoped that an independent Polish state, friendly with the Soviet Union, {{would be allowed to}} act as <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>between</b> the east and the west.|$|E
