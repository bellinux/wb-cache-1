5|$|Atlantis: the Lost Empire {{was meant}} to provide <b>a</b> <b>springboard</b> <b>for</b> an {{animated}} television series entitled Team Atlantis, which would have presented the further adventures of its characters. However, because of the film's under-performance at the box office, the series was not produced. On May 20, 2003, Disney released a direct-to-video sequel called , consisting of three episodes planned for the aborted series. In addition, Disneyland planned to revive its Submarine Voyage ride with an Atlantis theme with elements from the movie and the ride was promoted with a meet-and-greet by the movie's characters. These plans were canceled and the attraction was re-opened in 2007 as the Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage, its theme based on the 2003 Disney·Pixar animated film Finding Nemo.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of his {{conversion}} in 1625 onwards, Baltimore took care to cater for the religious needs of his colonists, both Catholic and Protestant. He had asked Simon Stock to provide priests for the 1625 expedition, but Stock's recruits arrived in England after Aston had sailed. Stock's own ambitions for the colony appear to have exceeded Baltimore's: in letters to De Propaganda Fide in Rome, Stock claimed the Newfoundland settlement could act as <b>a</b> <b>springboard</b> <b>for</b> the conversion of natives not only in the New World but also in China, the latter via a passage he believed existed from the east coast to the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Operation Winter '94 {{pushed back}} {{the front line}} of the VRS by about , {{capturing}} much of the Livanjsko field. The attack failed to achieve its primary objective but it brought the Croatian forces within striking distance of the Drvar–Knin road. Operation Winter '94 was followed by Operation Leap1 (Operacija Skok1) on 7 April 1995, which improved HV positions on Mount Dinara on the southern rim of the field, dominating the area around the RSK capital. The Croatian forces renewed their advance with Operation Leap2 between 4 and 10 June, allowing them to directly threaten Bosansko Grahovo on the Drvar–Knin road, and to secure the remainder of the valley. The improved Croatian dispositions around Livanjsko field provided <b>a</b> <b>springboard</b> <b>for</b> further offensive action on this front during Operation Summer'95.|$|E

5|$|While {{during the}} late 1920s and early 1930s {{relations}} with the Soviet Union became normalized to a degree, from 1938 on, the Soviets, anxious that Finland {{could be used as}} <b>a</b> <b>springboard</b> <b>for</b> an invasion, started negotiations to conclude a military agreement. At the same time, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's desire to recover the territories of Tsarist Russia lost during the chaos of the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War made Finland an obvious target. Due to the nature of Soviet demands, which included the installation of Soviet military facilities on Finnish soil, these negotiations went nowhere.|$|E

25|$|The city of Havana {{was founded}} by the Spanish in the 16th century and due to its {{strategic}} location it served as <b>a</b> <b>springboard</b> <b>for</b> the Spanish conquest of the Americas, becoming a stopping point for treasure-laden Spanish galleons returning to Spain. King Philip II of Spain granted Havana the title of City in 1592. Walls as well as forts were built to protect the old city. The sinking of the U.S. battleship Maine in Havana's harbor in 1898 was the immediate cause of the Spanish–American War.|$|E
25|$|Any re-introduced event would, {{unlike the}} 1900 version, also likely include a women's event.

25|$|Textiles and {{clothing}} {{is one of}} the largest manufacturing and exporting processes in the country and a huge employment absorber. The Egyptian apparel industry is attractive for two reasons. Firstly, its proximity to European markets, whose rapidly changing fashions require quick replenishment. Egypt's geographical proximity to style-conscious Europe is a logistical advantage. Secondly, the production of garments is a low-capital and high-labor-intensive industry, and the local population of 66 million provides a ready workforce as well as a natural local consumer market that acts as <b>a</b> <b>springboard</b> <b>for</b> exports.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{argues that}} the advent of powerful, {{affordable}} output devices offers {{the potential for a}} vastly expanded landscape of computationally-enriched mathe-matical craft activities in education. While mathematical crafts have a venerable history in classrooms, they have also suffered from a reputation of being both intellectually marginal and technologically retrograde. Nonetheless, this paper argues that craft activities have both intellectual and emotional affordances that are relatively lacking in ‘traditional’ computer-based education; and that the combination of crafts and computation (facilitated by novel output devices and materials) can render such activities still more valuable. <b>As</b> <b>springboards</b> <b>for</b> discussion, the paper describes three software applications geared toward computational crafts (HyperGami, HyperSpider, and MachineShop). Each of these systems highlights its own particular set of issues relevant to the development of output technolo-gies. Using these three systems as objects-to-think-with, the paper describes a wide variety of possible craft activities that could be invented or pursued in the near future with the aid of appropriately designed output devices...|$|R
5000|$|The Remagen affair {{caused a}} great {{stir in the}} German Supreme Command. Remagen should have been {{considered}} a basis for termination of the war. Remagen created a dangerous and unpleasant abscess within the last German defenses, and it provided <b>an</b> ideal <b>springboard</b> <b>for</b> the coming offensive east of the Rhine. The Remagen bridgehead made the other crossing of the Rhine a much easier task for the enemy. Furthermore, it tired German forces which should have been resting to withstand the next major assault.|$|R
25|$|The Confederate victory buoyed Southern sympathizers in Missouri {{and served}} as <b>a</b> <b>springboard</b> <b>for</b> a bold thrust north that carried Sterling Price and his Missouri State Guard as far as Lexington. In late October, a {{convention}} organized by Jackson met in Neosho and passed out an ordinance of secession. Although the state remained in the Union {{for the remainder of}} the war, the Battle of Wilson's Creek effectively gave the Confederates control of southwestern Missouri. Today, the National Park Service operates Wilson's Creek National Battlefield on the site of the original conflict.|$|E
25|$|In early October 1943, Hitler {{was persuaded}} by his Army Group Commander in Southern Italy, Field Marshal Albert Kesselring, that the defence of Italy should be {{conducted}} {{as far away from}} Germany as possible. This would {{make the most of the}} natural defensive geography of Central Italy, whilst denying the Allies the easy capture of a succession of airfields; each one being ever closer to Germany. Hitler was also convinced that yielding southern Italy would provide the Allies with <b>a</b> <b>springboard</b> <b>for</b> an invasion of the Balkans with its vital resources of oil, bauxite and copper.|$|E
25|$|Fassbinder {{used his}} {{theatrical}} work as <b>a</b> <b>springboard</b> <b>for</b> making films; {{and many of}} the Anti-Theater actors and crew worked with him throughout his entire career (for instance, he made 20 films each with actresses Hanna Schygulla and Irm Herrmann). He was strongly influenced by Brecht's Verfremdungseffekt (alienation effect) and the French New Wave cinema, particularly the works of Jean-Luc Godard. Fassbinder developed his rapid working methods early. Because he knew his actors and technicians so well, Fassbinder was able to complete as many as four or five films per year on extremely low budgets. This allowed him to compete successfully for the government grants needed to continue making films.|$|E
