5|$|Mason {{was born}} in 1725, most likely {{in what is now}} Fairfax County, Virginia. His father died when he was young, and his mother managed the family estates until he came of age. He married in 1750, built Gunston Hall, and lived the life of a country squire, supervising his lands, family, and slaves. He briefly served in the House of Burgesses and {{involved}} himself in community affairs, sometimes serving with his neighbor George Washington. As tensions grew between Britain and the American colonies, Mason came to support the colonial side, and used his knowledge <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> <b>to</b> help the revolutionary cause, finding ways to work around the Stamp Act of 1765 and serving in the pro-independence Fourth Virginia Convention of 1775 and the Fifth Virginia Convention of 1776.|$|E
5|$|The jamming {{operations}} were effective, {{but the decision}} to pack {{a large number of}} aircraft into relatively small airspace made it certain that German night fighters would locate some aircraft. At this time, German policy was to commit only Experten to battle as they had the skill <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> <b>to</b> find and shoot down Allied bombers. The first fighters were being vectored onto their targets as the bombs began to fall on Ladbergen. Four pilots claimed all eight of the Lancasters lost on the raid out of a operating force of some 203 bombers. Geschwaderkommodore of NJG 4, Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer claimed two; Hauptmann (Captain) Hermann Greiner claimed three; Hauptmann Josef Kraft claimed two, while Major Martin Drewes claimed one.|$|E

25|$|The {{fundamental}} principles of Jainism {{revolve around the}} concept of altruism, not only for humans but for all sentient beings. Jainism preaches the view of Ahimsa – to live and let live, thereby not harming sentient beings, i.e. uncompromising reverence for all life. It also considers all living things to be equal. The first Tirthankara, Rishabhdev introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings, from extending knowledge <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> <b>to</b> others to donation, giving oneself up for others, non-violence and compassion for all living things.|$|E

In his place, the producers tapped Steven Hill to play District Attorney Adam Schiff, a character loosely based on real-life New York County District Attorney Robert Morgenthau. Hill brought prestige <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> <b>to</b> the show and, as such, the producers allowed Hill to give insight on the direction he thought the character should go.|$|E

Eleven hundred Bengali officers and 23,000 soldiers were interned in West Pakistan, awaiting repatriation to Bangladesh.

25|$|Karl Giberson {{argues that}} when {{discussing}} compatibility, some scientific intellectuals often ignore the viewpoints of intellectual leaders in theology and instead argue against less informed masses, thereby, defining religion by non intellectuals and slanting the debate unjustly. He argues that leaders in science sometimes trump older scientific baggage and that leaders in theology do the same, so once theological intellectuals {{are taken into}} account, people who represent extreme positions like Ken Ham and Eugenie Scott will become irrelevant. Cynthia Tolman notes that religion {{does not have a}} method per se partly because religions emerge through time from diverse cultures, {{but when it comes to}} Christian theology and ultimate truths, she notes that people often rely on scripture, tradition, reason, <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> <b>to</b> test and gauge what they experience and what they should believe.|$|E
25|$|With {{both his}} courage <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> <b>to</b> draw from, Cézanne created a hybrid art-form. He {{combined}} {{on the one}} hand the imitative and the immobile, a system left over from the Renaissance, and the mobile on the other; together to forming a hybrid. His own generation would see in his contradictory codes nothing more than impotence, unaware of his intentions. However, the next generation would see in Cézanne greatness, precisely because of this duality. Cézanne was seen simultaneously as a classicist by those who chose to see in his work the imitation of nature and perspective, and as a revolutionary by those who saw in him a revolt against imitation and classical perspective. Timid, yet clearly manifest, was the will to deconstruct. Artists {{at the forefront of the}} Parisian art scene at the outset of the 20th century would not fail to notice these tendencies inherent in the work of Cézanne, and decided to venture still further.|$|E

In mid-June, The Wall Street Journal reported that Clinton's shortlist included Representative Xavier Becerra from California, Senator Cory Booker from New Jersey, Senator Sherrod Brown from Ohio, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro from Texas, Mayor of Los Angeles Eric Garcetti from California, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, Labor Secretary Tom Perez from Maryland, Representative Tim Ryan from Ohio, and Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts. Subsequent reports stated that Clinton was also considering Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, retired Admiral James Stavridis, and Governor John Hickenlooper of Colorado. In discussing her potential vice presidential choice, Clinton stated {{that the most important}} attribute she looked for was the ability <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> <b>to</b> immediately step into the role of president.|$|E

25|$|The split of 1955-56 largely {{involved}} tactical {{disagreements over}} how to move the UE's progressive program and brand of unionism forward {{in the face of}} the AFL-CIO merger. It proved a bitter disappointment to UE activists who had managed to bring the union successfully through the hardest years of the McCarthy period and the Cold War but who were now unable to keep the union together. Most locals in the UE's New York-north Jersey district (UE District 4) voted to go into the IUE reasoning that they had the strength <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> <b>to</b> influence the policies of the newer union. While this move was resented by UE activists elsewhere, especially in Pennsylvania and the midwest, the District 4 activists felt that the UE forces could soon have regained control of the re-united organization had the whole union followed their lead. By the mid-1960s, the former UE activists in IUE shops played a role in helping to bring about James Carey's ouster in a disputed election. Carey's departure eventually opened the way for the co-ordinated bargaining which partially healed the two decade old division in the industry.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{creating}} {{the show that}} was to become Shortland Street, Caterina De Nave set out to pursue many goals, {{one of which was}} to have strong powerful women as primary characters to counter stereotype the weak and vulnerable women often portrayed in dramas. De Nave and Television New Zealand also wished for as wide demographics as possible and many measures were set about to ensure the soap would reach a diverse audience. To fulfill this, De Nave created the roles of teenagers such as Nick Harrison, Stuart Neilson and Kirsty Knight to draw in a young audience. Family units were also commonly used in soap operas to sustain a wide variety of demographics in one group of characters and as such, the characters of Nick and Stuart were built around a family unit, with the single mother of Nick's, Jenny, being created to represent single parent families. Jenny was characterized to embody the strong matriarch De Nave wished to portray. Maggie Harper had just started a 4-year course on the natural healing technique, the Feidenkrais method, when she was cast in the role. She was said to bring her own strength <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> <b>to</b> the part. Jenny made her debut on the show's second episode, screened 26 May 1992.|$|E
