5|$|In {{the final}} round, Aaron Armstrong did not participate. He was {{replaced}} by then 24-year-old Emmanuel Callander, {{who was born in}} northern Trinidad <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not participate in any event besides the relay. Burns, Thompson and Bledman remained. During the final round, Trinidad and Tobago finished the relay in 38.06seconds, originally earning a silver medal behind the Jamaican team (37.10seconds), which set an Olympic and a world record with its performance. Jamaica was subsequently stripped of their gold medal due to doping charges and Trinidad and Tobago was awarded the gold. The Japanese team (38.15seconds) earned the bronze medal -- later promoted to silver -- in the event, placing immediately behind Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E
5|$|The Moldavians {{made the}} first move by sending musicians {{to the middle of}} the valley. The sound of drums and bugles made Suleiman think that the entire Moldavian army awaited him there. Instead, the centre of the valley held the Székely forces and the Moldavian {{professional}} army, which were ordered to make a slow retreat when they encountered the enemy. Suleiman ordered his troops to advance and, when they made enough progress, the Moldavian artillery started to fire, followed by archers and handgunners firing from three different directions. The archers could not see the enemy for the fog, and, instead, had to follow the noise of their footsteps. The Moldavian light cavalry then helped to lure the Ottoman troops into the valley by making hit-and-run attacks. Ottoman cavalry tried to cross the wooden bridge, causing it to collapse. Those Ottoman soldiers who had managed to survive the attacks from the artillery and the archers, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not get caught in the marshes, had to confront the Moldavian army, together with the Székely soldiers further up the valley. The 5,000 Székely soldiers were successful in repelling the 7,000 Ottoman infantrymen. Thereafter, they made a slow retreat, as instructed by Stephen, but were later routed by the Ottoman sipahi, while the remaining Ottoman infantry attacked the Moldavian flanks.|$|E
5|$|Upon Carroll's {{return to}} Maryland, Hart was incensed {{both at the}} threat to his own power {{and the idea of}} a Catholic officeholder in the colony. Hart demanded that Carroll take the oath of allegiance, which he was willing to do, and the oath of abjuration {{confirming}} the Protestant succession to the English throne, which Carroll was not willing to do. Carroll began to act in the capacity authorized by the proprietor's commission, and Hart turned to the upper house of the colonial legislature for relief. Rejecting Carroll's arguments in support of his right to hold government offices, the assembly resisted his attempts to exercise the commission and, near the end of 1716, passed a series of laws confirming and restricting the oath requirements for officeholders, which were anti-Catholic by intent. Carroll's case may have been undermined {{when he came to the}} defense of his nephew, who had raised a toast to the Catholic James Stuart. Stuart had tried to take the British throne during a rebellion in 1715 and was extremely unpopular with Protestants in the colony. The proprietor, whose position had been so recently restored <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not want to risk the loss of the colony, confirmed the decision of the assembly. Carroll's commission was formally revoked on 20 February 1717. According to a later account Hart gave to the assembly, Carroll began a campaign to undermine the Governor. There is no evidence that Hart was accurate, but the assembly passed stricter anti-Catholic laws in 1718, including disfranchisement, stripping Catholic males of the right to vote.|$|E

The accounts conveyed by other contributors have been left unaltered, to be taken, together with Mrs. Maverick's material, as illustrative of this phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Attendees {{included}} the king, officers and other dignitaries in rows of seats, {{as well as}} half of the inhabitants of Athens in the stands. Since {{it was one of}} the first mass gatherings in the city's modern history, neither the people nor the police had any previous experience with maintaining the order at such an event. The press of that time lauded the Games as being positive, but they were a disappointment for thousands of Athenians who could not see anything from the rear stands <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not understand this kind of event. The site was also unsuited for the sports and the weather was too cold. Moreover, the athletic competition had a more game-like than sportive character: as the competitors were not individuals who were seriously dedicated to athletics, the Organising Committee accepted the participation of workers, porters, etc., who were attracted by the monetary prizes of the Games. According to the press of the time, many comical incidents took place during the games: for instance, a policeman, who was assigned to watch over the crowds, left his post and participated in the races. Even a beggar, who pretended to be blind, participated in the races.|$|E

500|$|The State of California {{created the}} Donner Memorial State Park in 1927. It {{originally}} consisted of [...] surrounding the monument. Twenty years later, {{the site of}} the Murphy cabin was purchased and added to the park. In 1962, the Emigrant Trail Museum was added to tell the history of westward migration into California. The Murphy cabin and Donner monument were established as a National Historic Landmark in 1963. A large rock served as the back end of the fireplace of the Murphy cabin, and a bronze plaque has been affixed to the rock listing the members of the Donner Party, indicating who survived <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not. The State of California justifies memorializing the site because the episode was [...] "an isolated and tragic incident of American history that has been transformed into a major folk epic".

He joined the Scharnhorst, the Stahlhelm's youth organisation as a small boy in the 1930s, and later the Hitler Youth when the Nazis came to power in 1933. Influenced by his family's values, he felt that Nazism was advantageous to Germany and believed that the Nazis [...] "were the people who wanted the best for Germany <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> something about it." [...] He participated in the burning of books written by Jews and other authors that the Nazis considered degenerate in the belief that he was helping Germany free itself from an alien culture, and considered that National Socialism was having a positive effect on the economy, pointing to lower unemployment.|$|E
500|$|Salinger's final {{interview}} was in June 1980 with Betty Eppes of The Baton Rouge Advocate, {{which has been}} represented somewhat differently, depending on the secondary source.

According to the first account, the interview ended [...] "disastrously" [...] when a local passer-by from Cornish attempted to shake the famous author's hand, at which point Salinger became enraged. A further account of the interview published later in The Paris Review, purportedly by Eppes as author, has been disowned by Eppes and separately ascribed as a derived work of Review Editor George Plimpton.|$|E
