While scroll operations are normally carried out manually by the user, {{in the context of}} RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) techniques this work considers a presentation mode in which the image grid is automatically scrolled. Through experiments carried out with 50 testers, we have investigated user performance while looking for specific target subjects within large collections of images. Different numbers of columns and scrolling speeds have been considered. The search task implied both clicking on the identified target pictures and simply vocally stating their visual recognition. To this purpose, and to identify possible specific gaze behaviours, eye tracking technology has been exploited. The obtained results show that number of columns and scroll speed do affect search performance. Moreover, the userâs gaze tends to focus on different screen areas depending on the values of these two parameters.

50|$|The project {{started in}} September 1987 with an advance {{borehole}} using {{state of the}} art technology. The borehole reached its target depth of 4,000 metres in April 1989. The results of this drilling were used as parameters for the main borehole - for example the temperature gradient was higher than originally expected. The main drilling started on 8 September 1990 about 200 metres away from the advance borehole for an envisaged depth of 10,000 metres. The first 7,500 metres were using an <b>automatic</b> <b>vertical</b> drill head so that the lateral deviation could be limited to 12 metres. Due to the expected failure of the electronics below that depth a conventional drill head was used below that point. Due to brittleness and ductility the borehole was deforming multiple times, requiring to backfill the hole and start drilling again from a higher place. These operations continued for the last year of the project - the timing and budget constraints {{put an end to the}} efforts to go deeper. The drilling ended on 12 October 1994 after 1,468 days at a depth of 9,101 metres and about 300 metres lateral deviation showing a temperature of 265 °C. The planned three main experiments were performed until 31 December 1994. The facilities were being partially dismantled until 31 December 1995.|$|R
40|$|Background: Free ranging {{foraging}} {{animals can}} vary their searching intensity {{in response to}} the profitability of the environment by modifying their movements. Marine diving animals forage in a three dimensional space and searching intensity can be varied in both the horizontal and vertical planes. Therefore understanding the relationship between the allocation of searching effort in these two spaces can provide a better understanding of searching strategies and a more robust identification of foraging behaviour from the multitude of foraging indices (FIs) available. We investigated the movement of a widespread marine coastal predator, the harbour seal (Phoca vitulina), and compared two sets of foraging indices reflecting searching intensity respectively in the horizontal plane (displacement speed, extensive vs. intensive movement types, residence time) and in the vertical dimension (time {{at the bottom of a}} dive). We then tested how several factors (dive depth, direction of the trip with respect to haul-out site, different predatory tactics, the presence of factors confounding the detection of foraging, and temporal resolution of the data) affected their relationships. Results: Overall the indices only showed a very weak positive correlation across the two spaces. However controlling for various factors strengthened the relationships. Resting at sea, a behaviour intrinsically static in the horizontal plane, was found to be strongly negatively related to the time spent at the bottom of the dives, indirectly weakening the relationship between horizontal and <b>vertical</b> foraging <b>indices.</b> Predatory tactic (benthic vs. pelagic) was found to directly affect the relationship. In benthic (as opposed to pelagic) foraging a stronger positive relationship was found between <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>indices.</b> Conclusions: Our results indicated that movement responses, leading to an intensification of search, are similar in the two spaces (positive relationship), but additional factors need to be taken into account for this relationship to emerge. Foraging indices measuring residence in the horizontal plane tend to be inflated by resting events at sea, while <b>vertical</b> <b>indices</b> tend to distinguish mainly between periods of activity and inactivity, or of benthic and pelagic foraging. The simultaneous consideration of horizontal and vertical movements, as well as topographic information, allows additional behavioural states to be inferred, providing greater insight into the interpretation of foraging activity...|$|R
