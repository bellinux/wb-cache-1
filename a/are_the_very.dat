5|$|B.cuneata is {{very unusual}} in {{apparently}} suffering no seed loss due to granivory. In nearly all other species, burrowing insect larvae eat {{a large proportion}} of seeds, and birds cause further losses in breaking open cones in search of larvae to eat. The seed-eating insects are mostly species-specific, and it appears that no insect species has adapted to B.cuneata. Possible reasons for this <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> low seed counts, and the rarity of the species, both of which offer little incentive for adaptation to the species. There is also no evidence of granivores feeding on seed after it has fallen. As a result, this species has the highest rate of seed viability recorded for a Banksia species: in one study, 74% of all seed produced in the previous 12 years was viable. This was largely accounted for by seed under 9 years old, about 90% of which is viable. After the ninth year, viability is lost rapidly as the follicles decay and senescence sets in. Seed production itself starts very slowly. On average, plants aged between 5 and 12 years have about 18 seeds stored in their canopy. Storage increases exponentially, however, and 25-year-old plants often have tens of thousands of seeds. Seed production probably never plateaus. In fact, by the time a plant is twenty years old it has accumulated such a great weight of cones that major branches begin to break away; and by the age of thirty, plants have broken branches more often than not. As plants age, branch breakage increasingly leads to plant death, and it is unlikely that any plants live to more than 45 years.|$|E

Traditional plain X-rays are less useful in the imaging of soft tissues such as the brain or muscle.|$|E

500|$|The Great Escape, which Albarn {{told the}} public was the last {{instalment}} in the band's Life Trilogy, was released in September 1995 to ecstatic reviews.

500|$|After {{the fleet}} arrived in July 1776, Admiral Howe made several {{attempts}} to open communications with Continental Army General George Washington.

[...] Lord Howe then {{sent a letter to}} Benjamin Franklin detailing a proposal for a truce and offers of pardons. [...] After Franklin read the letter in Congress on July 30, he wrote back to the admiral that [...] "Directing pardons to be offered to the colonies, who <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> parties injured, [...] can have no other effect than that of increasing our resentments. [...] It is impossible we should think of submission to a government that has with the most wanton barbarity and cruelty burnt our defenseless town, [...] excited the savages to massacre our peaceful farmers, and our slaves to murder their masters, and is even now bringing foreign mercenaries to deluge our settlements with blood." [...] He also pointed out to the admiral that [...] "you once gave me expectations that reconciliation might take place."
