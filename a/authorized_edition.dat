500|$|By 2011, Maus {{had been}} {{translated}} into about thirty languages. [...] Three translations were particularly important to Spiegelman: French, as his wife was French, and because of his respect for the sophisticated Franco-Belgian comics tradition; German, given the book's background; and Polish. [...] Poland was the setting {{for most of the}} book and Polish was the language of his parents and his own mother tongue. [...] The publishers of the German edition had to convince the German culture ministry of the work's serious intent to have the swastika appear on the cover, per laws prohibiting the display of Nazi symbolism. [...] Reception in Germany was positive—Maus was a best-seller and was taught in schools. [...] The Polish translation encountered difficulties; as early as 1987, when Spiegelman planned a research visit to Poland, the Polish consulate official who approved his visa questioned him about the Poles' depiction as pigs and pointed out how serious an insult it was. [...] Publishers and commentators refused to deal with the book for fear of protests and boycotts. [...] Piotr Bikont, a journalist for , set up his own publishing house to publish Maus in Polish in 2001. [...] Demonstrators protested Mauss publication and burned the book in front of Gazetas offices. [...] Bikont's response was to don a pig mask and wave to the protesters from the office windows. [...] The magazine-sized Japanese translation was the only <b>authorized</b> <b>edition</b> with larger pages. [...] Long-standing plans for an Arabic translation have yet to come to fruition. [...] A Russian law passed in December 2014 prohibiting the display of Nazi propaganda led to the removal of Maus from Russian bookstores leading up to Victory Day due to the swastika appearing on the book's cover.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} popular construction of femininity in the United States during World War II {{and the ways}} in which a set of mass market series books for girls participated in and reflected the persuasive campaigns of government, private industry, and mass media to script feminine roles and behaviors in the United States during and shortly after World War II. The dissertation illustrates and explains how the Whitman <b>Authorized</b> <b>Editions</b> for Girls, and especially Invisible Scarlett O???Neil, the first female superhero in the American culture industry, reflected and modeled the lives of women in three stages. Overall, cultural representations of women began as domestic paragons of good behavior and traditional feminine beauty, changed into women working in traditionally male jobs to maintain and defend the homefront, and then gracefully returned to the domestic sphere. Geertz???s (1973) idea of common sense as cultural system is extended to consider the cultural symbolism and cultural presuppositions that impacted the stories and were presented in the stories of the Whitman <b>Authorized</b> <b>Editions</b> for Girls. While studies have been done concerning the intertwining of propaganda imperatives and adult popular fiction, this dissertation helps bridge the literature gap between propaganda studies and children???s popular fiction. Further, the cultural definitions and uses of Denning (1987), Cawelti (1976), and Wright (2001) are extended to examine a set of formula fictions based on newspaper strips, comic books, and motion-picture stars. In addition, the work of McGrath (1973) and Albrecht (1956) concerning the interaction of popular fiction and popular culture, the work of Gates (2003) concerning fantasy, and the work of Butler (1990) concerning identity and gender are extended to analyze how The Whitman <b>Authorized</b> <b>Editions</b> For Girls reinforced the social norms of the World War II period and operated as cultural fantasies of American femininity during this period. However, as Nava (1992) points out, the auditioning of identity through the consuming of cultural norms can sometimes be an empowering moment of finding identity and power in that identity. Many a reader may have grown up to fight crime without being invisible and to wear pants beyond 1945. I like to think they did...|$|R

"The Crown-Prince, {{reading this}} bad Book of Machiavel's, years ago, had been struck, as all honest souls, {{especially}} governors or apprentices to governing, must be, {{if they thought}} of reading such a thing, with its badness, its falsity, detestability; and came by degrees, obliquely fishing out Voltaire's opinion as he went along, {{on the notion of}} refuting Machiavel; and did refute him, the best he could. Set down, namely, his own earnest contradiction to such ungrounded noxious doctrines; elaborating the same more and more into clear logical utterance; till it swelled into a little Volume; which, so excellent was it, so important to mankind, Voltaire and friends were clear for publishing. Published accordingly it was; goes through the press next Summer (1740), under Voltaire's anxious superintendence: [Here, gathered from Friedrich's Letters to Voltaire, is the Chronology of the little Enterprise:--1738, MARCH 21, JUNE 17, [...] "Machiavel a baneful man," [...] thinks Friedrich. [...] "Ought to be refuted by somebody?" [...] thinks he (date not known). 1739, MARCH 22, Friedrich thinks of doing it himself. Has done it, DECEMBER 4;--"a Book which ought to be printed," [...] say Voltaire and the literary visitors. 1740, APRIL 26, Book given up to Voltaire for finished; Book appears, [...] "end of SEPTEMBER," [...] when a great change had occurred in Friedrich's title and position.] for the Prince has at length consented; and Voltaire hands the Manuscript, with mystery yet with hints, to a Dutch Bookseller, one Van Duren at the Hague, who is eager enough to print such an article. Voltaire himself--such his magnanimous friendship, especially if one have Dutch Lawsuits, or business of one's own, in those parts--takes charge of correcting; lodges himself in the 'Old Court' (Prussian Mansion, called VIEILLE COUR, at the Hague, where 'Luiscius,' figuratively speaking, may 'get an alms' from us); and therefrom corrects, alters; corresponds with the Prince and Van Duren, at a great rate. Keeps correcting, altering, till Van Duren thinks he is spoiling it for sale;--and privately determines to preserve the original Manuscript, and have an edition of that, with only such corrections as seem good to Van Duren. A treasonous step on this mule of a Bookseller's part, thinks Voltaire; but mulishly persisted in by the man. Endless correspondence, to right and left, ensues; intolerably wearisome to every reader. And, in fine, there came out, in Autumn next,"--the Crown-Prince no longer a Crown-Prince by that time, but shining conspicuous under Higher Title,--"not one ANTI-MACHIAVEL only, but a couple or a trio of ANTI-MACHIAVELS; as printed 'at the Hague;' as reprinted 'at London' or elsewhere; the confused Bibliography of which has now fallen very insignificant. First there was the Voltaire text, <b>Authorized</b> <b>Edition,</b> 'end of September, 1740;' then came, in few weeks, the Van Duren one; then, probably, a third, combining the two, the variations given as foot-notes:--in short, I know not how many editions, translations, printings and reprintings; all the world being much taken up with such a message from the upper regions, and eager to read it in any form.|$|E

40|$|American novelist Catharine Maria Sedgwick had {{an unusually}} long career and her books were reprinted in Britain {{in a variety}} of {{circumstances}} and formats. Both her first novel, A New-England Tale (1822), and her last, Married or Single? (1857), appeared in London editions arranged by her or her American publishers, as did many of her books in between (including travel, children’s and conduct books). However, her works also appeared in unauthorized reprints. Sedgwick thus makes an interesting case study of how law and custom regulated the reprinting of American literary texts in Great Britain after 1820. Focusing on the British reprinting of American literature through Sedgwick’s case reveals changes in practice over several decades and illuminates an understudied phase in British publishing history: the emergence of cheap reprints of American novels in the late 1830 s. Scholars have analyzed how James Fenimore Cooper and Washington Irving negotiated British publishing and copyright. Both men resided in Britain for extended periods in the 1820 s and 1830 s, giving them a legal and logistical edge, and built long-term relationships with prominent London publishers (Cooper with Henry Colburn and Richard Bentley, and Irving with John Murray). Furthermore, because Cooper turned out novels annually, competing publishers anticipated their appearance. 1 In contrast, Sedgwick produced books regularly, but not annually, shifted US and authorized London publishers multiple times and negotiated the British market primarily from across the Atlantic. While Irving and Cooper’s cases, and especially Cooper’s, illuminate Sedgwick’s, her career reveals more typical trade practices. Sedgwick’s pursuit of British publication of her books required close attention to publishing procedures and the timing of editions. Her negotiations with publishers, sometimes aided by brothers and nephews trained in the law, also shed light on her authorship and approach to the literary marketplace. The modest proceeds from British editions suggest that her desire to become known on the British cultural scene motivated her more than money. In the 1820 s, the high-priced <b>authorized</b> <b>editions</b> of Sedgwick’s novels were a novelty for British readers. By the late 1830 s, however, the cheap editions of contemporary novels already common in the USA became increasingly common in Britain, and she began to pursue <b>authorized</b> <b>editions</b> in order to fend off unauthorized reprints. She also, however, pursued <b>authorized</b> <b>editions</b> less consistently after 1835, while concurrently British publishers began issuing competing cheap editions of her books, including the novels of the 1820 s and 1830 s. These cheap reprints both undermined Sedgwick’s control over her works and made her newly visible to a wider class of British readers...|$|R
