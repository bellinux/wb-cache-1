40|$|Inertial {{microfluidics}} is {{a promising}} tool for many lab-on-a-chip applications. Particles in channel flows with Reynolds numbers above one undergo cross-streamline migration to a discrete set of equilibrium positions in square and rectangular channel cross sections. This effect {{has been used}} extensively for particle sorting and the analysis of particle properties. Using the lattice Boltzmann method, we determine equilibrium positions in square and rectangular cross sections and classify their types of stability for different Reynolds numbers, particle sizes, and channel aspect ratios. Our findings thereby help to design microfluidic channels for particle sorting. Furthermore, we demonstrate how an axial control force, which slows down the particles, shifts the stable equilibrium position towards the channel center. Ultimately, the particles then stay on the centerline for forces exceeding a threshold value. This effect is sensitive to particle size and channel Reynolds number <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>an</b> efficient method for particle separation.

This phenomenon can be viewed as an abnormal multisensory integration process as here the synesthetic percept is aberrantly fused with the stimulated modality. Indeed, recent synesthesia research has focused on multimodal processing even outside of the specific synesthesia-inducing context and has revealed changed multimodal integration, thus suggesting perceptual alterations at a global level. Here, we focused on audio-visual processing in synesthesia using a semantic classification task in combination with visually or auditory-visually presented animated and in animated objects in an audio-visual congruent and incongruent manner. Fourteen subjects with auditory-visual and/or grapheme-color synesthesia and 14 control subjects participated in the experiment. During presentation of the stimuli, event-related potentials were recorded from 32 electrodes. The analysis of reaction times and error rates revealed no group differences with best performance for audio-visually congruent stimulation indicating the well-known multimodal facilitation effect.

At 8 s, we observe low offshore group velocities best explained by {{the influence of the}} water layer and thick water-laden sediments. At long periods (20 - 30 s), group velocities are lower on the South Island relative to its offshore flanks, due to thickened crust beneath the island, with the lowest velocities primarily beneath the Southern Alps. Group velocity azimuthal anisotropy fast directions near the Alpine Fault align with the direction of relative plate motion between the Australian and Pacific plates. In the southern portion of the island, fast directions rotate anticlockwise, likely in response to a decrease in dextral shearing away from the plate boundary. Azimuthal anisotropy fast directions align with absolute plate motion offshore on the Pacific plate.

The first order topography between the Himalayan Frontal Thrust and the Main Boundary Thrust shows a marked lateral variation along strike of the mean gradient, characterised by a very small mean slope angle (ca. 1 °) in correspondence with the reentrants and higher values (ca. 3 °) in the salient. These tectonic and topographic features also show a good correspondence with the peculiar macroseismic field of the 1905 event(s), which is characterised by two distinct intensity maxima, separated by {{a distance of about}} 150 km, clearly overlapping the two major tectonic reentrants.

Surprisingly, even if DNA replication or mitosis is inhibited, centrosome duplication can still occur [1 – 5]. Thus, it remains unknown how centrosome duplication is coordinated with the cell cycle. Here, we show that centrosome duplication requires cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk 2) in mammalian cells. We have found that in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, whereas centrosome duplication is not inhibited by hydroxyurea (HU) treatment, which arrests the cells in S phase, it is inhibited by mimosine treatment, which arrests the cells in late G 1 phase. Cdk 2 activity was higher in HU-treated cells than in mimosine-treated cells. Remarkably, inhibition of the Cdk 2 activity in HU-treated cells with butyrolactone I or roscovitine [6], or by expression of the Cdk inhibitor p 21 Waf 1 /Cip 1, blocked the continued centrosome duplication. Moreover, overexpression of Cdk 2 reversed the inhibition of centrosome duplication by mimosine treatment.
