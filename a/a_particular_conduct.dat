40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis presents two frequency switchable micro strip line filters. It also presents a third filter {{that has the potential}} for frequency and bandwidth reconfiguration. All of these filters are reconfigured using an optically activated silicon switch. This method of tuning is very simple, cheap, and effective. Three new, fixed frequency, filters were also developed as a bi-product of the research presented in this thesis. These filters are smaller than their predecessors, or conventional counterparts. Two Metallodielectric Electromagnetic BandGap (MEBG) low-pass filters, number amongst the new filter designs. These low-pass filters offer a sharper rate of cut-off than is associated with the conventional stepped-impedance filter. They also provide a deep, broad, and well defined stop-band. A miniatursed triangular patch band-pass filter is also presented. This work develops on research by Hong, Lancaster, et al. Design equations and/or modelling aids are presented for each of the new filter structures. On occasions these modelling aids {{take the form of a}} lumped-element equivalent circuit together with a series of polynomial equations for determining the element values. Modelling aids, of this nature, are presented for the cymbal resonator band-pass filter. The study into frequency tuneable filters led to an investigation of <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>conduct</b> polymer and the production of a tutorial on dielectric measurement...|$|E

The basic idea is to transform a convex optimization problem with a non-differentiable objective function into an unconstrained non-convex problem, upon which, via gradient descent, reaching a globally optimum solution is guaranteed.

40|$|In {{his recent}} book Attempts, Gideon Yaffe {{suggests}} that attempts should be criminalized because of a principle he dubs the "Transfer Principle. " This principle holds that if <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> form of <b>conduct</b> is legitimately criminalized, then the attempt to engage in that form of conduct is also legitimately criminalized. Although Yaffe provides a powerful defense of the Transfer Principle, in this paper I argue that Yaffe's argument for it ultimately does not succeed. In particular, I formulate two objections to Yaffe's argument for the Transfer Principle. First, I argue that a basic assumption about criminalization, on which Yaffe's argument crucially depends, is incomplete, and Yaffe's own attempt to supplement it undermines his argument for the Transfer Principle. Second, I argue that Yaffe's argument does not properly account {{for the fact that}} those who merely attempt a crime and those who complete it might sometimes be responding to reasons in different ways. Accordingly, I conclude that Yaffe has not succeeded in establishing the truth of the Transfer Principle. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|R

At the same time, Hands notes that Knight's methodological plurahsm was accompanied by a theoretical monism. Whereas Knight was a pluralist about the various categories of human inquiry, he also held the traditional neoclas-sical view that economics is the investigation of goal-directed rationality, where 'economic laws in any 'very strict and distinctive meaning are reached through isolating by abstraction <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> aspect of <b>conduct</b> and ignoring much that is quite as real and importanf (Knight, 1946, p. 111).

40|$|This article {{explains}} why the child welfare process {{was used in the}} 2008 San Angelo, Texas raid on the FLDS community which resulted in the removal of more than 400 children from their families.

The criminal justice system contains many more time honored protections of civil liberties than the child welfare system. In addition, using the child welfare system contains one additional danger: the contamination and expansion of child welfare law to permit coercive intervention, authorizing state officials to remove children from families based on notions of morality.

40|$|Abstract: One of {{the most}} {{influential}} and known view regarding the morality of war is the Just War Theory wherein certain requirements must be met in order to justify a war being fought by a state. The traditional Just War Theory judges wars in two principles, the justice of resorting into war in the first place, jus ad bellum and the justice in the conduct of war, jus in bello. Most just war theorists claim that the two must be independent of each other, that is, one may find himself in a war wherein the jus ad bellum is just, meaning the justice of war itself is just, while the jus in bello is unjust, and vice versa. This paper will tackle and evaluate the conditions given by the just war theory. Also, this paper will argue that jus ad bellum and jus in bello must be not be independent of each other when justifying a war. Jus in bello must follow from jus ad bellum and the two principles must be met before one can say that <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> war is just. The dependence of the two principles will also imply that the cause has a great bearing in determining whether <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> action or <b>conduct</b> in war is just or unjust. This will also be an argument against the “moral equality of soldiers. ...|$|R
40|$|A spatial {{instrument}} {{is defined as}} a display device which has been either geometrically or symbolically enhanced to better enable a user to accomplish <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> task. Research <b>conducted</b> {{over the past several years}} on 3 -D spatial instruments has shown that perspective displays, even when viewed from the correct viewpoint, are subject to systematic viewer biases. These biases interfere with correct spatial judgements of the presented pictorial information. It is also found that deliberate, appropriate geometric distortion of the perspective projection of an image can improve user performance. These two findings raise intriguing questions concerning the design of head-mounted spatial instruments. The design of such instruments may not only require the introduction of compensatory distortions to remove the neutrally occurring biases but also may significantly benefit from the introduction of artificial distortions which enhance performance. These image manipulations, however, can cause a loss of visual-vestibular coordination and induce motion sickness. Additionally, adaptation to these manipulations is apt to be impaired by computational delays in the image display. Consequently, the design of head-mounted spatial instruments will require an understanding of the tolerable limits of visual-vestibular discord...|$|R

During the period corresponding to the transition from life to death, when the human being who is about to relinquish life for good lives, suffers, understands and needs assistance, most of the physicians adopt <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> detachment <b>conduct.</b> The physician’s participation in assisting the patient, constant until then, natural, sharply decreases the moment the diagnosis has become, ''there is nothing else to be done". This phrase “there is nothing else to be done” should be only the conclusion of one phase of the assistance given by a physician, the curative, healing assistance and the beginning of another one, the phase of “assisting the dying person”, a phase that has to {{be an integral part of}} the physician’s mission which represents a more difficult medicine, much more demanding for the physician. At this point, assistance, treatments depend on the ability of the person providing assistance to endure the fear of death in which he is included himself. The necessity of meeting the needs of the dying people has led to the drafting of “a charter of the rights of the dying”. Such charter was drafted during the symposium, “Terminally ill patient and helping person ” organized by Wayne State University, Detroit, USA. Taking into account the idea that the dying person “has the right to live until the end ” within the best possible conditions the palliative care have been developed.
