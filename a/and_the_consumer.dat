5|$|In net {{metering}} {{the price of}} the electricity produced {{is the same as the}} price supplied to the consumer, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> is billed on the difference between production and consumption. Net metering can usually be done with no changes to standard electricity meters, which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference, and because it allows homeowners and businesses to generate electricity at a different time from consumption, effectively using the grid as a giant storage battery. With {{net metering}}, deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month. Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kWh credits. Excess credits upon termination of service are either lost, or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above, as can be excess annual credits. In New Jersey, annual excess credits are paid at the wholesale rate, as are left over credits when a customer terminates service.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{an energy}} trading and pricing problem for microgrids with {{uncertain}} energy supply.

Figure 3 clearly shows that, with {{a rise in the}} income of the consumer, the initial budget line B1 moves outward parallel to itself to B2 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> now chooses X' bundle to the initial bundle X*. The figure shows that, the demand for X2 has risen from X21 to X22 with an outward shift of the budget line from B1 to B2 (caused due to rise in the income of the consumer). This essentially means that, good X2 is a normal good as the demand for X2 rose with an increase in the income of the consumer.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{recognizing}} how {{crony capitalism}} weakened the economy due to collusion {{between government and}} big business and adhering to the Catholic social principle of subsidiarity, President Aquino {{set out on a}} course of market liberalization agenda {{while at the same time}} emphasizing solidarity, people empowerment and civic engagement to help alleviate poverty in the country. The Aquino administration also sought to bring back fiscal discipline in order as it aimed to trim down the government's budget deficit that ballooned during Marcos' term through privatization of bad government assets and deregulation of many vital industries. As president, Aquino sought out to dismantle the cartels, monopolies and oligopolies of important industries that were set up by Marcos cronies during the dark days of Martial Law, particularly in the sugar and coconut industries. By discarding these monopolies and allowing market-led prices and competition, small farmers and producers were given a fair chance to sell their produce and products at a more reasonable, competitive and profitable price. This, in a way, also helped a lot in improving the lot of farmers who are in dire need of increasing their personal income and earnings. It was also during Aquino's time that vital economic laws such as the Built-Operate-Transfer Law, Foreign Investments Act <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Consumer</b> Protection and Welfare Act were enacted.|$|E

500|$|PEDs, in {{combination}} with price elasticity of supply (PES), {{can be used to}} assess where the incidence (or [...] "burden") of a per-unit tax is falling or to predict where it will fall if the tax is imposed. For example, when demand is perfectly inelastic, by definition consumers have no alternative to purchasing the good or service if the price increases, so the quantity demanded would remain constant. [...] Hence, suppliers can increase the price by the full amount of the tax, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> would end up paying the entirety. In the opposite case, when demand is perfectly elastic, by definition consumers have an infinite ability to switch to alternatives if the price increases, so they would stop buying the good or service in question completely—quantity demanded would fall to zero. [...] As a result, firms cannot pass on any part of the tax by raising prices, so they would be forced to pay all of it themselves.|$|E
