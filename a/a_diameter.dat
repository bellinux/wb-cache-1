5|$|NGC 1664 is {{a fairly}} large open cluster, with <b>a</b> <b>diameter</b> of 18 arcminutes, and {{moderately}} bright, with a magnitude of 7.6, comparable to several other open clusters in Auriga. One open cluster with a similar magnitude is NGC 1778, with a magnitude of 7.7. This small cluster has <b>a</b> <b>diameter</b> of 7 arcminutes and contains 25 stars. NGC 1857, a small cluster, is slightly brighter at magnitude 7.0.

Far dimmer than the other open clusters is NGC 2126 at magnitude 10.2. Despite its dimness, NGC 2126 is as concentrated as NGC 1857, having 40 stars in <b>a</b> <b>diameter</b> of 6 arcminutes.|$|E

50|$|The {{different}} {{sounds of}} these tonal families of pipes arise from their individual construction. The tone of a flue pipe {{is affected by}} {{the size and shape of}} the pipes as well as the material out of which it is made. A pipe with <b>a</b> wide <b>diameter</b> will tend to produce a flute tone, a pipe with <b>a</b> medium <b>diameter</b> <b>a</b> diapason tone, and a pipe with <b>a</b> narrow <b>diameter</b> <b>a</b> string tone. <b>A</b> large <b>diameter</b> pipe will favor the fundamental tone and restrict high frequency harmonics, while <b>a</b> narrower <b>diameter</b> favors the high harmonics and suppresses the fundamental. The science of measuring and deciding upon pipe diameters is referred to as pipe scaling, and the resulting measurements are referred to as the scale of the pipe.|$|R

5|$|NGC 678 and NGC 680 are a pair {{of galaxies}} in Aries that are only about 200,000 light-years apart. Part of the NGC 691 group of galaxies, both are at a {{distance}} of approximately 130 million light-years. NGC 678 is an edge-on spiral galaxy that is 4.5 by 0.8 arcminutes. NGC 680, an elliptical galaxy with an asymmetrical boundary, is the brighter of the two at magnitude 12.9; NGC 678 has a magnitude of 13.35. Both galaxies have bright cores, but NGC 678 is the larger galaxy at <b>a</b> <b>diameter</b> of 171,000 light-years; NGC 680 has <b>a</b> <b>diameter</b> of 72,000 light-years. NGC 678 is further distinguished by its prominent dust lane. NGC 691 itself is a spiral galaxy slightly inclined to our line of sight. It has multiple spiral arms and a bright core. Because it is so diffuse, it has a low surface brightness. It has <b>a</b> <b>diameter</b> of 126,000 light-years and is 124 million light-years away. NGC 877 is the brightest member of an 8-galaxy group that also includes NGC 870, NGC 871, and NGC 876, with a magnitude of 12.53. It is 2.4 by 1.8 arcminutes and is 178 million light-years away with <b>a</b> <b>diameter</b> of 124,000 light-years. Its companion is NGC 876, which is about 103,000 light-years from the core of NGC 877. They are interacting gravitationally, as they are connected by a faint stream of gas and dust. Arp 276 is a different pair of interacting galaxies in Aries, consisting of NGC 935 and IC 1801.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, Albert Michelson and Francis Pease {{mounted a}} 6-meter {{interferometer}} {{on the front}} of the 2.5-meter telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory.
