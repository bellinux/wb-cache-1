40|$|If the Planck {{scale is}} around a TeV in {{theories}} with large extra dimension, then gravitons should {{be produced in}} high energy hadronic collisions at the LHC. In this paper we compute the direct graviton production cross section in a pp and PbPb collision at LHC at \sqrt s^{NN}= 14 TeV and 5. 5 TeV respectively. The graviton production cross section in <b>a</b> lead-lead <b>collision</b> is enhanced in comparison to <b>a</b> pp <b>collision</b> at LHC depending upon the minimum transverse energy of the jet E_{T,jet}^{min} above which the graviton production cross section is computed. For two extra dimensions and above E_{T,jet}^{min} = 100, 500, 1000, 1500 GeV the ratio of graviton production cross sections in <b>a</b> PbPb <b>collision</b> to that in <b>a</b> pp <b>collision</b> {{is found to be}} 2220, 400, 43, 2. For four extra dimensions this ratio is found to be 470, 100, 10, 0. 5. In the Randall-Sundrum model the radion production cross section is also found to be enhanced in <b>a</b> lead-lead <b>collision</b> over that in <b>a</b> pp <b>collision</b> at LHC. The ratio of the radion production cross sections in <b>a</b> PbPb <b>collision</b> to that in <b>a</b> pp <b>collision</b> at LHC is found to be 1650, 460, 180, 67, 23, 1 for radion of masses 100, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000 GeV respectively.

40|$|We briefly {{review the}} dilepton {{experiments}} at BEVALAC/SIS and SPS energies for p + p, p + A and <b>A</b> + <b>A</b> <b>collisions</b> {{as well as}} our present understanding of the data within transport theoretical simulations.

The implications of the off-shell dynamics – relative to the conventional on-shell transport dynamics – are discussed for proton spectra, high energy γ, pion, kaon and antikaon production from GANIL to AGS energies in comparison to experimental data. ...|$|R
