50|$|<b>As</b> <b>cattle</b> {{breeding}} {{was never}} a main {{source of income for}} Kfarsghab, it is possible that Morh Kfarsghab was used in winter for the Mullberry silkworms which represented a major activity in the region.|$|R
5|$|In the 12th {{century the}} ancient parish of Leigh {{was made up}} of six townships, {{including}} Pennington, Bedford, Westleigh, Atherton, Astley, and Tyldesley cum Shakerley. Weekly markets were held by the parish church and <b>a</b> <b>cattle</b> fair held twice-yearly.|$|E
5|$|In the gated {{community}} of Vista Verde, teenager Josh Comstock is riding his motorcycle, unaware {{that he is}} being followed by an unseen man driving a van. He is later stopped by the driver and pacified with <b>a</b> <b>cattle</b> prod. The following morning, Comstock's mother finds a corpse in his bed—but {{it is not that}} of her son.|$|E
5|$|The killer—Willi Borgsen (Van Quattro)—is next seen attacking pigs in {{a trailer}} using <b>a</b> <b>cattle</b> prod. Borgsen is accosted by the pigs' owner, and {{responds}} by turning the cattle prod on him. The victim's body is later found in a nearby thicket. Black examines the scene, determining from the bootprints and evidence of the cattle prod being used that the killer works in a slaughterhouse.|$|E
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>cattle</b> traffic {{increased}} it {{was found}} that more wagons were needed. The Victorian Railways decided on a bogie design rather than more four-wheelers. So in 1928, 25 vans were constructed, the MM class.|$|R

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>cattle</b> egret will weakly {{defend the}} area around a grazing animal against others of the same species, but if the area is swamped by egrets it will give up and {{continue}} foraging elsewhere. Where numerous large animals are present, cattle egrets selectively forage around species that move at around 5–15steps per minute, avoiding faster and slower moving herds; in Africa, cattle egrets selectively forage behind plains zebras, waterbuck, blue wildebeest and Cape buffalo. Dominant birds feed nearest to the host, and obtain more food.|$|E
5|$|Birckenbuehl's son Charlie is kidnapped {{from his}} bedroom, again subdued with <b>a</b> <b>cattle</b> prod.

The town's swimming instructor, Adam Burke (Brian Taylor) is interviewed, as he had contact with both missing boys through his coaching. Black discovers that Burke's son had been killed in a hit-and-run accident; Black also receives post containing a paint swatch with the number 528 on it, but he is unsure of its meaning.|$|E
5|$|Britain was {{the world}} leader in the {{construction}} of railways, and their use to expand trade and coal supplies. The first successful locomotive-powered line in Scotland, between Monkland and Kirkintilloch, opened in 1831. Not only was good passenger service established by the late 1840s, but an excellent network of freight lines reduce the cost of shipping coal, and made products manufactured in Scotland competitive throughout Britain. For example, railways opened the London market to Scottish beef and milk. They enabled the Aberdeen Angus to become <b>a</b> <b>cattle</b> breed of worldwide reputation.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} 20 years of settlement, {{there was only}} limited contact between the {{settlers}} and Aboriginal people. Joseph Franklin purchased land in the Brindabellas in 1849 and attempted to set up <b>a</b> <b>cattle</b> farm. His livestock were slaughtered by the local Aboriginal people and he was driven {{back out of the}} mountains. The rush of prospectors into the Kiandra area through the Brindabellas and the mountains {{to the west of the}} ACT as a result of the Kiandra goldrush led to conflict with the Aboriginal people. By the time Franklin returned to the Brindabellas in 1863, the indigenous population had been significantly reduced.|$|E
5|$|Farmers rely on weather {{forecasts}} {{to decide}} what work to do on any particular day. For example, drying hay is only feasible in dry weather. Prolonged periods of dryness can ruin cotton, wheat, and corn crops. While corn crops can be ruined by drought, their dried remains {{can be used as}} <b>a</b> <b>cattle</b> feed substitute in the form of silage. Frosts and freezes play havoc with crops both during the spring and fall. For example, peach trees in full bloom can have their potential peach crop decimated by a spring freeze. Orange groves can suffer significant damage during frosts and freezes, regardless of their timing.|$|E

5|$|R.C.

R.C. MacLeod stated his belief that the flag would only have been waved twice, and so rejected the tradition of it being unfurled at the Battle of Bloody Bay—because the MacLeods were on the losing side! R.C. MacLeod also wondered if it had been waved in 1600, when the clan was in a desperate state in the midst of warring with the Macdonalds of Sleat.|$|E
5|$|Reich {{was born}} {{the first of two}} sons to Leon Reich, a farmer, and his wife Cäcilie (née Roniger) in Dobzau, Galicia, then part of Austria-Hungary, now in Ukraine.

5|$|Schouler {{leaves the}} city to become <b>a</b> <b>cattle</b> rancher.

Even though she has saved over $200 {{in addition to the}} original $5,000 from the lottery ticket, Trina is unwilling to spend her money. Money becomes increasingly scarce, with the couple forced to sell their possessions. McTeague finally snaps and bites Trina's fingers in a fit of rage. Later, he goes fishing to earn money, taking Trina's savings (now totaling $450).|$|E

5|$|Sleaford was {{primarily}} an agricultural town until the 20th century, supporting <b>a</b> <b>cattle</b> market, with seed companies, such as Hubbard and Phillips, and Sharpes International Seeds, being {{established in the}} late 19th century. The arrival of the railway made the town favourable for malting. Industry has declined, and in 2011 the most common occupations are in wholesale and retail trade, health and social care, public administration and defence and manufacturing. Regeneration of the town centre {{has led to the}} redevelopment of the old industrial areas, including the construction of the National Centre for Craft & Design on an old wharf.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian Air Force sent five {{fixed-wing}} aircraft and three helicopters {{to the region}} for an extensive search and rescue (SAR) operation.

He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.|$|E
