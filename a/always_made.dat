5|$|Caldas has a {{tradition}} of embroidery (bordado) possibly dating to the 15th century. Legend has it that Queen Leonor's handmaidens, seeing the monarch without her usual brilliance after selling off her jewellery, embroidered her cloak so that it appeared to have golden threads. Caldas embroidery is almost <b>always</b> <b>made</b> with three shades of molasses brown thread on white linen, and on rare occasion with white thread on brown linen. Known for its symmetry, the craft's common themes include arachnids, spirals, angles, birds, hearts, crowns, and shrimp nets.|$|E
5|$|For 1968, Austrian Jochen Rindt {{replaced}} Hulme, who {{had left}} to join McLaren. Repco produced a more powerful version of their V8 to maintain competitiveness against Ford's new Cosworth DFV, but it proved very unreliable. Slow communications between the UK and Australia had <b>always</b> <b>made</b> identifying and correcting problems very difficult. The car was fast—Rindt set pole position twice during the season—but Brabham and Rindt finished only three races between them, and ended the year with only ten points.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as the}} {{composition}} of the blazon is agreed to by both parties a final grant could then be created. This {{takes the form of a}} handmade colourfully illuminated and decorated Letters Patent. The letter is written and painted in vellum by a College artist and scrivener. The grant is then signed and sealed by the King of Arms, it is then handed to the petitioner, authorising the use of arms blazoned therein as the perpetual property of himself and his heirs. A copy of the grant is <b>always</b> <b>made</b> for the College's own register.|$|E

5|$|In {{his major}} {{theoretical}} statement, 'Opera and Drama' (1852), Wagner {{objected to the}} music of Meyerbeer, asserting its superficiality and incoherence in dramatic terms; this work contains Wagner's well-known put-down of Meyerbeer's operas as 'effects without causes'. It also contains the sardonic crack that ' never could have dreamt that it would some day occur to the Bankers, for whom he had <b>always</b> <b>made</b> their music, to make it for themselves'. 'Jewishness in Music' was reissued in 1869, (after Meyerbeer's death) in an extended form, with a far more explicit attack on Meyerbeer. This version was under Wagner's own name – and as Wagner had by now a far greater reputation, his views obtained far wider publicity. These attacks on Meyerbeer (which also included swipes at Felix Mendelssohn) are regarded by Paul Lawrence Rose as a significant milestone in the growth of German anti-Semitism.|$|E
5|$|Lambertia formosa grows as a {{spreading}} shrub to 2m (7ft) tall, {{with one}} or more stems arising from a woody base known as a lignotuber. The new growth is covered with a fine brownish hair. The stiff leaves are arranged in whorls of 3, or sometimes up to 4 to 6, on the stems, and are linear to narrow-oblanceolate in shape. Measuring anywhere from 1 to 8cm (0.4–3in) in length and 0.2–0.7cm wide, they have a pointed tip or apex. Flowers are seen at any time of the year, but more often over spring and summer (September to January). Their bases are covered by greenish and reddish bracts. The inflorescences are almost <b>always</b> <b>made</b> up of seven smaller individual flowers (less than 1% of flowerheads have either six or eight flowers), known as florets, and can be shades of red or pink in colour. The tubular perianths are 4.5cm (1.6in) long, with the styles protruding another 1–1.5cm (0.5in) beyond. Flowering is followed by the development of woody fruit which measure 2–3 by 1–2cm. They have two 1–1.5cm sharp horny protuberances, and a 0.5cm 'beak', initially pale green in colour before fading to a grey-brown. These woody follicles each have two flat, winged seeds that are retained until burnt by fire.|$|E

50|$|Sex is a man's supreme game; his {{own private}} and {{perennial}} Olympics. He must <b>always</b> be <b>made</b> to feel {{that he is the}} dominant force, even if the woman generates the state of play.|$|R

50|$|A non-quantitative {{description}} of his third law that Nernst gave {{at the very beginning}} was simply that the specific heat can <b>always</b> be <b>made</b> zero by cooling the material down far enough. A modern, quantitative analysis follows.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of land at The Holden Arboretum is maintained {{in a natural}} state. Even though it gives the appearance of being untouched, crucial management decisions are <b>always</b> being <b>made</b> to maintain the diversity and health of these areas.|$|R

25|$|Eden, who was well-mannered, well-groomed, and good-looking, <b>always</b> <b>made</b> a {{particularly}} cultured appearance.

25|$|Captain Keay {{moved from}} Ariel to Oberon {{in the autumn}} of 1868 - Ariel {{disappeared}} on passage from London to Australia in 1872. It is generally assumed that she was fatally pooped - her fine lines <b>always</b> <b>made</b> her at risk of this.|$|E
5000|$|The {{absence of}} {{accreditation}} was <b>always</b> clearly <b>made</b> known by SIT to potential students, {{as well as}} employing organizations. For employment purposes, accreditation is of less importance since a degree from an accredited school was required for regular admission to SIT.|$|R
60|$|Moreover, the {{considerations}} of Section 6 {{are based on}} yet a second assumption, which, {{in the light of}} a strict consideration, appears to be arbitrary, although it was <b>always</b> tacitly <b>made</b> even before the introduction of the theory of relativity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Three {{and three}} make six, three and three <b>always</b> have <b>made</b> six, and three and three always will make six!" [...] cried Fred in a girlish tone of voice. [...] "So what's {{the use of}} asking a {{question}} like that?" ...|$|R

25|$|Since the {{emergence}} of philosophy, sages and self-proclaimed wizards <b>always</b> <b>made</b> enormous efforts to find the secret of youth, both for themselves and for their noble patrons and sponsors. It was widely believed that some potions may restore the youth.|$|E
25|$|Until recently, the guqin's strings were <b>always</b> <b>made</b> {{of various}} {{thicknesses}} of twisted silk, {{but since then}} most players use modern nylon-flatwound steel strings. This was {{partly due to the}} scarcity of high quality silk strings and partly due to the newer strings' greater durability and louder tone.|$|E
50|$|Regardless of the patient, {{pronouncement}} {{of death}} must <b>always</b> be <b>made</b> with absolute certainty {{and only after}} it has been determined that the patient is not a candidate for resuscitation. This type of decision is rather sensitive, and can be difficult to make.|$|R
5000|$|Vierlings {{generally}} {{consist of}} two matching shotgun barrels, a [...]22 caliber rimfire rifle barrel and a centerfire rifle barrel.

25|$|Until {{well into}} the 20th century {{and the advent of}} {{mechanized}} trail grooming, cross-country tracks were <b>always</b> <b>made</b> by the first skiers to pass through undisturbed, fresh snow and leave a parallel set of ski tracks behind them. Certain local and regional trails are available where the passage of skiers is the sole source of tracks.|$|E
25|$|In some stories, the {{question}} remains unresolved of whether formal justice will ever be delivered, such as Five Little Pigs and Endless Night. According to P. D. James, Christie often, but not <b>always,</b> <b>made</b> the unlikeliest character the guilty party. Savvy readers could sometimes identify the culprit by simply identifying the least likely suspect.|$|E
25|$|As he aged, Bean {{spent much}} of his profits helping the poor of the area, and <b>always</b> <b>made</b> sure that the schoolhouse had free {{firewood}} in winter. He died peacefully in his bed on 16 March 1903, after a bout of heavy drinking in San Antonio. He and a son, Sam Bean (1874–1907), are interred at the Whitehead Memorial Museum in Del Rio.|$|E

30|$|Nigeria {{is good in}} the {{formulation}} of policies, but poor at implementation ([Onibokun 1998]).
