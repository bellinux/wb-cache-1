40|$|Background: Undesirable {{outcomes}} {{in health care}} are associated with patient harm and substantial excess costs. Coarctation of the aorta (CoA), {{one of the most}} common congenital heart diseases, can be repaired with stenting but requires monitoring and subsequent interventions to detect and treat disease recurrence and aortic wall injuries. <b>Avoidable</b> <b>costs</b> associated with stenting in patients with CoA are unknown. Methods: We developed an economic model to calculate potentially <b>avoidable</b> <b>costs</b> in stenting treatment of CoA in the United Kingdom over 5 years. We calculated baseline costs for the intervention and potentially avoidable complications and follow-up interventions and compared these to the costs in hypothetical scenarios with improved treatment effectiveness and complication rates. Results: Baseline costs were £ 16 688 ($ 25 182) per patient. <b>Avoidable</b> <b>costs</b> ranged from £ 137 ($ 207) per patient in a scenario assuming a 10 % reduction in aortic wall injuries and reinterventions at follow-up, to £ 1627 ($ 2455) in a Best-case scenario with 100 % treatment success and no complications. Overall costs in the Best-case scenario were 90. 2 % of overall costs at Baseline. Reintervention rate at follow-up was identified as most influential lever for overall costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed a considerable degree of uncertainty for <b>avoidable</b> <b>costs</b> with widely overlapping 95 % confidence intervals. Conclusions: Significant improvements in the treatment effectiveness and reductions in complication rates are required to realize discernible cost savings. Up to 10 % of total baseline costs could be avoided in the best-case scenario. This highlights the need to pursue patient-specific treatment approaches which promise optimal outcomes...|$|R

Tradable permits have a large impact on profits for the generators and British Coal.

However, the transmission system may restrain the output capability of the power plant, especially, if the power plant is located in an area of non-expandable transmission system. In this situation, any disturbance in the nearby transmission system may force the plant to generate lower than its rated value, which disables it from selling the remaining available generated power to the costumers and also increases the cost of energy not supplied.

40|$|A {{quarter of}} a century ago, nuclear policy was the {{dominating}} issue in Swedish politics. There was a strong public opinion in favour of doing without nuclear power, but also a strong coalition of the electricity intensive industry and their suppliers in favour of nuclear expansion. The anti-nuclear movement was dispersed by a national referendum, presenting three alternatives, all including statements of future nuclear decommissioning. After the referendum nuclear investment continued so that Sweden produced more electricity nuclear per capita then {{any other country in the}} world. The over capacity that followed resulted in electricity prices so low that the last reactor investments were clearly unprofitable. As competition was introduced, and electricity prices fell further, not even <b>avoidable</b> <b>costs</b> at the older plants could be covered.

This research and analysis calculates savings from 1997 through 2015 will equal a total of $ 376. 32 billion, if a PROMETHEUS Payment system had been implemented. This research also indicates that utilizing a PROMETHEUS Payment Model could potentially increase the quality of health care. The PROMETHEUS model focuses on driving down the costs of services by limiting the need for patient readmissions. The PROMETHEUS Model allows a set amount for Potentially <b>Avoidable</b> <b>Costs</b> (PAC) and the PAC’s incentivize hospitals and doctors to prevent <b>avoidable</b> <b>costs</b> in order to collect the PAC stipend as a bonus.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to assess}} the {{economic}} loss associated with clinical (CM) and subclinical (SCM) mastitis under current Swedish farming conditions. Stochastic simulation was used to investigate the impact of mastitis on technical and economic results of a 150 -cow dairy herd. The yearly <b>avoidable</b> <b>cost</b> of mastitis, assuming that the initial incidence (32 and 33 cases of CM and SCM per 100 cow-years, respectively) could be reduced by 50 %, was estimated at € 8 095. This figure corresponded to 5 % of the economic net return for the herd given the initial incidence of mastitis. Expressed as an average per cow/year, the <b>avoidable</b> <b>cost</b> of mastitis was estimated at € 54. The economic loss associated with mastitis could not be reduced by discarding milk with high somatic cell count, because {{this resulted in a}} substantial decrease of the volume of sold milk which was not offset by the increase in milk price. Cases of CM and SCM were on average associated with an average economic loss of € 275 and € 60, respectively. Reduced milk production constituted the major cost component of the economic loss caused by mastitis. The magnitude of yield loss associated with mastitis occurring in different stages of lactation was assessed using mixed linear models. The dataset was collected in a research herd between 1987 and 2004, and consisted of weekly test-day records sampled in 1200 lactations. The most extensive yield loss was estimated when CM developed in early lactation and when SCM (modelled by means of increased somatic cell count) occurred in late lactation. The 305 -day yield loss associated with CM varied between 0 and 705 kg milk in primiparous cows and between 0 and 902 kg milk in multiparous cows, depending on lactation week at onset. Most cases of CM developed {{in the first week of}} lactation and resulted in a yield loss of 578 and 782 kg milk in primiparous and multiparous cows, respectively. Daily yield loss at an SCC of 500 000 cells/ml ranged from 0. 7 to 2. 0 kg milk in primiparous cows and from 1. 1 to 3. 7 kg milk in multiparous cows. The yield loss in an average 305 -day lactation affected by SCM was 150 and 450 kg milk in primiparous and multiparous cows, respectively...|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem in managing product {{development is the}} optimal timing, frequency, and fidelity of sequential testing activities that are carried out to evaluate novel product concepts and designs. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model that treats testing as an activity that generates information about technical and customer-need related problems. An analysis of the model results in several important findings. First, optimal testing strategies need to balance the tension between several variables, including the increasing cost of redesign, {{the cost of a}} test as function of fidelity, and the correlation between sequential tests. Second, a simple form of our model results in an EOQ-like result: The optimal number of tests (called the Economic Testing Frequency or ETF) is the square root of the ratio of <b>avoidable</b> <b>cost</b> and the cost of a test. Third, the relationship between sequential tests can have an impact on optimal testing strategies. If sequential tests are increasing refinements of one another, managers should invest their budgets in a few high-fidelity tests, whereas if the tests identify problems independently of one another it may be more effective if developers carry out a higher number of lower-fidelity tests. Using examples, the implications for managerial practice are discussed and suggestions for further research undertakings are provided.

However, a reliable data storage system does not guarantee data entering reliability. We aimed to evaluate if double-blind control of the data manager might have any effect on data-reliability. Our secondary aim was to assess the influence of the inserting position in the insertion-sheet on data-entry accuracy and the effectiveness of electronic controls in identifying data-entering mistakes. Methods A cross-sectional survey and single data-manager data entry. Data from PACMeR_ 02 survey, which had been conducted within a framework of the SESy-Europe project (PACMeR_ 01. 4), were used as substrate for this study. We analyzed the electronic storage of 6446 medical charts. We structured data insertion in four sequential phases. After each phase, the data stored in the database were tested in order to detect unreliable entries through both computerized and manual random control. Control was provided in a double blind fashion. Results Double-blind control of the data manager didn't improve data entry reliability. Entries {{near the end of the}} insertion sheet were correlated with a larger number of mistakes.

40|$|Most {{development}} objectives {{focus on the}} well-being of individuals. Poli-cies are targeted to increase the percentage of individuals who avoid poverty, who can read, who are free from hunger and illness, or who can find gainful employment. Individual welfare, however, is based {{in large part on}} a com-plex set of interactions among family members. Until recently most policy analyses implicitly viewed the household as having only one set of preferences. This assumption has been a powerful tool for understanding household behavior, such as the distribution of tasks and goods. But a growing body of evidence suggests that this view is an expe-dience that comes at considerable, and possibly <b>avoidable,</b> <b>cost.</b> The article argues that more effective policy instruments will emerge from analyzing the processes by which households balance the diverse interests of their members. E xperience in several sectors shows that, when policymakers neglect pat-terns of distribution within households, they do so at their peril. Con-sider government attempts to target programs to individuals in certain age groups, rather than to households: nutritionists, for example, recognizing the vulnerability of preschool children, often target supplementary feeding to this age group. International experience, however, indicates that such interven-tions will not succeed unless the actions of other household members are taken into account; households often reduce the amount of food given to the target child at home and distribute it among the child's siblings (Beaton and Ghassemi 1982; Kennedy and Alderman 1987).

The discussion in the wider canvas of the national scenario is substantiated {{by focusing on the}} Kerala power sector, taken for illustrative purpose. It is shown that much of the capacity/energy deficit we experience today could be easily avoided with some achievable functional improvement in the power sector. We also estimate, on some very plausible assumptions, the <b>avoidable</b> <b>cost</b> of inefficiency at a few amenable functional levels and find it to represent about one-third of the reported cost of electricity supply in India in 1997 - 98 ! Given such scope for cost reduction, the attempts at tariff hikes amount to transferring the inefficiency onto the customers. Based on these observations, we argue that the present system predicament is due to problems that are just internal to the system. This then implies that there do remain sufficient quarters for remedial exercises, meant to remove the problems that {{stand in the way of}} the SEBs' improved performance.

Health care services are increasingly utilizing reminder systems to manage these negative effects. This study explores the effectiveness of reminder systems for promoting attendance, cancellations, and rescheduling of appointments across all health care settings and for particular patient groups and the contextual factors which indicate that reminders are being employed sub-optimally. We used three inter-related reviews of quantitative and qualitative evidence. Firstly, using pre-existing models and theories, we developed a conceptual framework to inform our understanding of the contexts and mechanisms which influence reminder effectiveness. Secondly, we performed a review following Centre for Reviews and Dissemination guidelines to investigate the effectiveness of different methods of reminding patients to attend health service appointments. Finally, to supplement the effectiveness information, we completed a review informed by realist principles to identify factors likely to influence non-attendance behaviors and the effectiveness of reminders. We found consistent evidence that all types of reminder systems are effective at improving appointment attendance across a range of health care settings and patient populations. Reminder systems may also increase cancellation and rescheduling of unwanted appointments. “Reminder plus”, which provides additional information beyond the reminder function may be more effective than simple reminders (ie, date, time, place) at reducing non-attendance at appointments in particular circumstances. We identified six areas of inefficiency which indicate that reminder systems are being used sub-optimally. Unless otherwise indicated, all patients should receive a reminder to facilitate attendance at their health care appointment. The choice of reminder system should be tailored to the individual service. To optimize appointment and reminder systems, health care services need supportive administrative processes to enhance attendance, cancellation, rescheduling, and re-allocation of appointments to other patients...|$|E
