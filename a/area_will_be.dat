5|$|From 1932 to 1992, Birkebeinerrittet, a mass ski {{marathon}} between Rena and Lillehammer, {{has used}} Stampesletta as a start or goal area, depending on if the race ran from Lillehammer to Rena {{or in the}} opposite direction. Since 1992, the goal area was moved to Birkebeineren Ski Stadium. Birkebeinerrittet, a cycle version of the ski marathon, has its goal area at Stampesletta. The half-marathon terrain race Birkebeinerløpet uses Stampesletta as its start and goal area. During the 1994 Winter Olympics, Stampesletta was used for medal ceremonies for all non-skating events. The backdrops for the podium was built using ice and snow, with the podium itself being made from ice from the glacier Jostedalsbreen. This contrasted with the surrounding pine elements. Attendance was free, and between 25,000 and 30,000 people attended the medal ceremonies. Lillehammer is scheduled to host the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics. The Stampesletta <b>area</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> used for the opening and closing ceremonies with a spectator capacity of 6,000 to 8,000; existing and new buildings nearby {{will be used for}} the Olympic Village.|$|E
5|$|Segments {{are further}} divided into work areas, {{indicated}} by brackets {{in the list}} above. Work {{is scheduled to begin}} in Segments 2 and 4 and proceed from north to south within each segment before moving on to Segments 1 and 3. The first work <b>area</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> in the cities of South San Francisco and San Bruno. Within each work area, the first activity will be tree pruning and removal (scheduled duration, two months) followed by construction of the foundations for the overhead contact system poles (scheduled duration, three to five months). Once the foundations are complete, construction of the traction power substation (estimated at twelve months in duration) and pole and wire installation (estimated at three months) will work in parallel. Schedules have been announced for Segment 2, Work Areas 5 (South City/San Bruno), 4 (Millbrae/Burlingame), and 3 (San Mateo). Traction power substations have been confirmed for South San Francisco and Burlingame, with another traction power substation in the city of San Mateo at a site yet to be named.|$|E

25|$|Adsorption is {{the process}} of {{trapping}} atoms or molecules that are incident on a surface; therefore the adsorption capacity of a material increases with its surface area. In three dimensions, the maximum surface <b>area</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> obtained by a structure which is highly porous, such that atoms and molecules can access internal surfaces. This simple qualitative argument suggests that the highly porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) should be excellent candidates for hydrogen storage devices.|$|E
25|$|The {{new airport}} will share only one runway with the {{existing}} one – the current runway will become the north runway of the new airport. Most of the old Schönefeld Airport, including the terminal and apron areas, will undergo complete urban redevelopment following its closure.

30|$|The {{spatial pattern}} of China’s {{minority}} {{population has been}} formed through a historical process and relates very closely with {{the current status of}} socio-economic development. As a result, the basic differences between ethnic groups will still exist in the foreseeable future. With progress in the economy, society and urbanization, the ethnic minority <b>areas</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> greatly developed. The redistribution of minority population will change with increasing population movements. However, the overall distribution pattern of minority populations and the relative backward situation of ethnic <b>areas</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> maintained for a long time.|$|R

25|$|It is {{impossible}} for a German soldier to distinguish between partisans and non-partisans... The regiment's {{view is that the}} area must be subdivided into a) pacified areas, b) areas threatened by gangs, c) gang infested areas. In areas threatened by gangs the men should be permitted to leave town and work only in groups; all males passing through such areas alone or in small groups must be shot or imprisoned at once... The bandit infested area must be swept clean of all males. Up to specific point in time, males up to the age of 50 will be seized and turned over to the economic office as laborers. After the deadline, men in this <b>area</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> shot.|$|E

25|$|SSS {{can make}} {{changes to the}} Handbook {{as long as there}} is a {{proposal}} made and brought to Senate's attention. If the motion passes, it goes to the Principal. If the Principal agrees, the proposed bill would then go to the Superintendent to look at. If the Superintendent agrees with the bill, the bill will then be brought upon the School Board to decide the proposed bill should be passed. If the bill passes, the bill will then be written into effect the next school year, and the affected <b>area</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> changed in the Handbook. Newfound SSS has changed some of the policies around school, including the usage of technology, as well as eating in the academic wings. If the motion fails, the proposal will go back to the appropriate committee in which they will make the necessary edits in order to improve the proposal. Most of the time the motion fails is because of the wording, or the proposal is not deemed necessary. In order for such proposal to pass, the motion must have the majority ruling in favor of the proposal.|$|E

40|$|The Dutch {{government}} aims at a {{transport system}} which is `sustainable safe'.
