The man, who has some work which he must do, desires to leave the woman in absolute safety while he does it. It {{is not an easy}} problem, but he solved it in an original fashion, and so effectively that her presence was not even known to the landlady who supplies her with food. The printed messages, as is now evident, were to prevent her sex being discovered by her writing. The man cannot come near the woman, or he will guide their enemies to her. Since he cannot communicate with her direct, he has recourse to the <b>agony</b> <b>column</b> of a paper. So far all is clear." ...|$|E

Obviously by advertisement through a newspaper. There seems no other way, and fortunately we need concern ourselves with the one paper only. Here are the Daily Gazette extracts of the last fortnight. 'Lady with a black boa at Prince's Skating Club'--that we may pass. 'Surely Jimmy will not break his mother's heart'--that appears to be irrelevant. 'If the lady who fainted on Brixton bus'--she does not interest me. 'Every day my heart longs--' Bleat, Watson--unmitigated bleat! Ah, this is a little more possible. Listen to this: 'Be patient. Will find some sure means of communications. Meanwhile, this column. G.' That is two days after Mrs. Warren's lodger arrived. It sounds plausible, does it not? The mysterious one could understand English, even if he could not print it. Let us see if we can pick up the trace again. Yes, here we are--three days later. 'Am making successful arrangements. Patience and prudence. The clouds will pass. G.' Nothing for a week after that. Then comes something much more definite: 'The path is clearing. If I find chance signal message remember code agreed--One A, two B, and so on. You will hear soon. G.' That was in yesterday's paper, and there is nothing in to-day's. It's all very appropriate to Mrs. Warren's lodger. If we wait a little, Watson, I don't doubt that the affair will grow more intelligible." ...|$|R

5000|$|Holmes and Dr. Watson {{break into}} Oberstein's empty house {{and examine the}} windows, finding that the grime has been smudged, {{and there is a}} bloodstain.

Some messages from the Daily Telegraph <b>agony</b> <b>column,</b> all seeming to allude to a business deal, are also found, posted by [...] "Pierrot", and this gives Holmes an idea.

50|$|EAST {{and other}} autism {{charities}} were besieged by {{phone calls from}} distressed parents following the article by Dr Vernon Coleman, a former general practitioner who was renowned for his outspoken views in his <b>agony</b> uncle <b>column</b> ‘’Casebook’’ in the Sunday People. Spencer-Thomas, whose elder son has severe autism, condemned Coleman’s remarks as “irresponsible, medically unsound and deeply hurtful” to families that had a child with autism. Coleman had also claimed that diagnoses of hyperactivity and autism were “misused by middle-class, aspirational parents to excuse the behaviour of their obnoxious children.” Spencer-Thomas challenged Coleman to spend 24 hours caring for his son {{in the presence of}} fully trained carers who understood the devastating and debilitating effects of autism. Coleman declined to take up the challenge and refused to withdraw his remarks. But Spencer-Thomas had the last word when he referred the matter to the Press Complaints Commission and the newspaper’s editor, Bridget Rowe, printed an apology.|$|R
5000|$|YS's content varied widely, {{occasionally}} {{ignoring the}} subject of computers entirely. As the Spectrum scene diminished and there was less software to review, this happened more frequently. In 1992, under the editorship of Andy Hutchinson, several 'lifestyle' type sections were introduced. These included Haylp!, an <b>agony</b> aunt <b>column,</b> and The World (later retitled Flip!), which contained reviews of films and books. This section included The Killer Kolumn From Outer Space, dedicated to science fiction news, rumours and reviews. It was written by Dave Golder, {{who went on to}} be the second editor of the successful SFX. Writing in the 100th issue of that publication, Golder cited his earlier work on YS and described SFX as [...] "like hundreds of Killer Kolumns stapled together". Flip! was discontinued, but the Killer Kolumn was kept on until the penultimate issue in 1993. A similar page to Flip!/The World had existed in 1987-88 called Street Life, but this had also contained Spectrum game charts.|$|R
40|$|Any {{cohabiting}} couple, {{married or}} unmarried, may at some stage find their relationship has deteriorated {{to such an}} extent that one or both partners contemplate abandoning it. This study examines the factors around that decision at two points in New Zealand’s history: 1950, when the country was settling back into peacetime life after World War II (WWII), and 1980, when romantic relationships and the family itself had been subjected to critique by the liberalising tides of social change in the West of the 1960 s and 1970 s, and by which time the divorce rate had increased significantly. It examines the <b>agony</b> aunt <b>columns</b> in the widely-read New Zealand Woman’s Weekly in both years to detect the nature of those changes, on the assumption that these relatively unedited voices from the past, discussing their relationships with the ‘expert’ – but actually amateur – advisor, the agony aunt, can reveal how troubled individuals thought about these matters and how underlying values and beliefs about love, marriage and divorce may have changed in the thirty years between. The study revealed that, although references to traditional expectations of love and marriage were more numerous in the 1950 columns than in the 1980 ones, traces of traditional attitudes could be found in the latter and of more liberal and more feminist attitudes in the former. In 1980 a higher standard of behaviour appears to have been expected than in 1950 within both de facto and de jure marriages; in 1950 the agony aunt was more likely to advise the correspondents to remain in unsatisfactory marriages. Where the 1950 columns encouraged women into a stoical acceptance of inequalities in their marriages and advised the use of coquetry and other artful ploys to ‘manage’ husbands ¬– who were characterised as ‘vain’ – the 1980 columns encouraged correspondents to practise ‘open communication’, and in particular not to put up with physical violence – a subject which could now be discussed (deplored) in public as it could not in 1950. Along with this sub-text of attempting to attain more equitable romantic relationships, the 1980 agony aunt could also refer her correspondents to the ‘experts’ at Marriage Guidance – a network of counselling services which had arisen in the interim. This study has been limited by its time frames and use of a single genre. Research into later data sets (for example, the columns in 2010, a further 30 years into the future) could reveal how attitudes to love, marriage and divorce have continued to change in New Zealand. In addition, the advent in the 1980 columns of letters from older children and teenagers seeking advice about their custody arrangements suggests the need for further research into the historical lived experiences of some children of divorce...|$|R
