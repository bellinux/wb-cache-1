This study investigates the behaviour of tilted-shaped angle shear connectors under monotonic loading using experimental push out tests. Eight push-out specimens are tested to investigate the effects of different angle parameters on the ultimate load capacity of connectors. Two different tilted angles of 112. 5 and 135 degrees between the angle leg and steel beam are considered. In addition, angle sizes and lengths are varied. Two different failure modes were observed consisting of concrete crushing-splitting and connector fracture. By increasing the size of connector, the maximum load increased for most cases.

40|$|<b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>recent</b> <b>researches,</b> it is {{desirable}} to extend Industrial Robots (IR) applicability to strategic fields such as heavy and/or fine deburring of customized parts with complex geometry. In fact, from a conceptual point of view, anthropomorphic manipulators could effectively provide an excellent alternative to dedicated machine tools (lathes, milling machines, etc.), by being both flexible (due to their lay-out) and cost efficient (20 - 50 % cost reduction as compared to traditional CNC machining). Nonetheless, in order to successfully enable high quality Robotic Deburring (RD), {{it is necessary to}} overcome the intrinsic robot limitations (e. g. reduced structural stiffness, backlash, time-consuming process planning/optimization) by means of suitable design strategies and additional engineering tools. Within this context, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to present recent advances in design methods and software platforms for RD effective exploitation. Focusing on offline methods for robot programming, two novel approaches are described. On one hand, practical design guidelines (devised via a DOE method) for optimal IR positioning within the robotic workcell are presented. Secondly, a virtual prototyping technique for simulating a class of passively compliant spindles is introduced, which allows for the offline tuning of the RD process parameters (e. g. feed rate and tool compliance). Both approaches are applied in the design of a robotic workcell for high-accuracy deburring of aerospace turbine blades...|$|E
40|$|N and P found {{naturally}} in soils, however agricultural activities increased {{the concentration of}} these nutrients resulting in poor water quality and eutrophication. Excessive concentration of P {{is the most common}} cause of eutrophication in fresh water lakes and reservoirs while N is the key controlling nutrient in ocean. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>recent</b> <b>researches,</b> a comparison between N and P resulted in a general rule that reduction of N loading cannot decrease eutrophication as that of P. To be able to assess the potential of nonpoint source P pollution and to develop proper management strategies to reduce P losses to surface waters, it is essential to understand the major processes involved in P transport. Terrestrial processes are responsible for P inputs from upland and riparian areas while aquatic processes include stream bank inputs and in stream P inputs, outputs and transformations. This study focuses in modeling dissolved P load from Lake Tana Basin. Semi-distributed model is used considering the contribution of base flow; interflow and overland flow to dissolved P. Amazingly, the model predicted phosphorus load with an excellent efficiency with limited data we have and many constraints. Parameter analysis indicated that the contribution of overland flow to dissolved P is higher in most of Lake Tana Basin catchments hence agricultural could be the major source of P in the stream. The fertilized areas would also have great contribution to surface runoff P concentration. Some management practices are proposed from literatures to reduce P load. Keywords...|$|E

The aim of this study was to ascertain the expression of kisspeptin, its receptor (kiss 1 r), and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), and to explore the role on the development and maintenance of the reproductive function of developing female rats. MethodsExpressions of the kisspeptin/kiss 1 r system were examined by immunohistochemistry and Real time Quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). Expressions of estradiol (E 2), luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ResultsExpression of the kisspeptin/kiss 1 r system increased time dependently with aging, and their peak expression was demonstrated in the adult stage. GnRH showed a similar expression pattern to that of the kisspeptin/kiss 1 r system. ELISA results demonstrated that the E 2, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone secretion increased time dependently from infancy to prepuberty to puberty. However, E 2  level decreased significantly in adult rats. Morphological changes of ovaries showed that primordial follicles, primary follicles, and growing follicle inhabited the dominant status in infancy, prepuberty, and puberty stages, respectively. ConclusionGnRH neurons may play an intermediate role in the activation and maintenance of the reproductive function regulated by the kisspeptin/kiss 1 r system, which may also indirectly regulate the serum level of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and E 2...|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: Learning Language is a skill {{which is}} {{acquired}} in early childhood. So, language gradually developed and new words and new structures slowly added to language knowledge. Hearing sense {{is the most}} important acquisition for of language and hearing disorder is a barrier for natural language acquiring. The {{purpose of this study is}} comparison between morphological and syntactic features of 4 to 5 years old severe to profound hearing impaired and normal children. Materials and Method: This cross-sectional study performed on 10 normal-hearing children with mean age of 4 - 5, from Gazvin kindergartens and 10 hearing impaired children with similar IQ and age from Nioosha Rehabilitation Center. The language and non language information was received by spontaneous and descriptive speech, and questionnaire, respectively and for comparing syntax comprehension, Specific language impairment test was used. Then these results were compared between two groups. Results: Difference between spontaneous speech and descriptive speech in hearing impaired child is just like normal child. These differences are that the number of utterance, the mean of lexical morpheme, functional morpheme in spontaneous speech is greater than descriptive speech but the mean length of utterance and richness of vocabulary in descriptive speech is greater than spontaneous speech. Mean of lexical morpheme, functional morpheme and richness of vocabulary related to morphological part and the number of utterance, the mean length of utterance and syntax comprehension related to syntax, in spontaneous and descriptive speech of normal children speech is greater than hearing impaireds`. Conclusion: <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>recent</b> <b>researches,</b> compared with normal child, the hearing impaired child nearly never to reach equal level, and for this reason, training for this group is necessary. It is concluded that although these children have severe to profound hearing loss they are developing their language by auditory training, hearing aid, language therapy and educational assistance and they only have delay in period of language learning. In the other words, language growth of a 4 - 5 year old hearing impaired child is almost similar to a 3 year old normal child...|$|E
