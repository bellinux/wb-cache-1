His father named him in honour of Argentine footballer Diego Maradona despite the rivalry between the two nations, and he has an elder brother named Jair after Brazilian player Jairzinho.

5|$|The {{rejection}} of the Tanner sighting as crucial to the timeline allowed investigators to focus on another sighting of a man carrying <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>that</b> night, this one reported by Martin and Mary Smith, on holiday from Ireland.

5|$|The {{figure of}} Joan of Arc {{represents}} both a common person and <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>that</b> was free from society's corruption. Between the editions, however, Southey's understanding {{of politics and}} religion began to change, and this {{is reflected in the}} changes of Joan of Arc for the second edition. Joan was originally a character that had a natural understanding of religion that was connected to a Socinian form of Christianity. She, as a child, was ignorant of Church and of theology except what was revealed to her directly. However, this was replaced in the second edition with Joan having a more traditional form of religion that was provided to her during her youth.|$|E
5|$|The {{sighting}} by Jane Tanner, {{one of the}} Tapas Seven, of a man carrying <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>that</b> night {{became an}} important part of the early investigation. She had left the restaurant just after 21:00 to check on her own daughter, passing Madeleine's father on Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins on his way back to the restaurant from his 21:05 check. He had stopped to chat to a British holidaymaker, but neither man recalled having seen Tanner. This puzzled the Portuguese police, given how narrow the street was, and led them to accuse Tanner of having invented the sighting.|$|E
60|$|A changeling, {{according}} to folk-lore and fairy tale, is <b>a</b> fairy <b>child</b> <b>that</b> the fairies substitute for <b>a</b> human <b>child</b> <b>that</b> they have stolen. The changeling was generally sickly, shrivelled {{and in every}} way repulsive. Here the poet reverses the superstition, substituting the angels for the mischievous fairies, who bring <b>an</b> angel <b>child</b> {{in place of the}} lost one. Whittier has a poem on the same theme, The Changeling.|$|R

25|$|The {{inspiration}} for the name came from a Pee-wee brand miniature harmonica and the surname of an energetic boy Reubens knew from his youth. Reubens thought the name Pee-wee Herman was a name that sounded too real to be made up, and like a real name a parent would give <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>that</b> they didn't really care about.|$|E
25|$|In fact, barren mothers often {{call upon}} the spirit to cure their affliction. Many traditions hold that Mami Wata herself is barren, so if she gives a woman <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> <b>that</b> woman {{inherently}} becomes more distanced from the spirit's true nature. The woman will thus {{be less likely to}} become wealthy or attractive through her devotion to Mami Wata. Images of women with children often decorate shrines to the spirit.|$|E

25|$|This {{scientific}} breakthrough established standards {{and became an}} agent of change for women suffering from the afflictions of infertility and for women {{who did not want}} to pass on genetic disorders to their children.

Although donor embryo transfer as practiced today has evolved from the original non-surgical method, it now accounts for approximately 5% of in vitro fertilization recorded births.|$|E

That was very clear and I thought, 'Well, there's not much I can do. I can just, sort of, stand by and watch.' It's very difficult, seeing your mother, going through her emotional problems and drinking and then behaving in that manner… Her condition became quite bad. It worsened and she did have an alcoholic breakdown and landed in the hospital.|$|E

However, to keep the audience focused and use imagination to depict situations and places that do not cater to the average person, the number of visions of the past and extreme situations of the plot kept increasing all the time for the project.|$|E

25|$|If a male {{does not}} {{successfully}} prevent an intrasexual rivals' attempt at mating, {{there are many}} risks. If the female becomes fertilised, then the male loses the opportunity to reproduce with that partner {{for an extended period}} of time and his genes will not be passed on to the offspring. Moreover, the male may invest years of time, resources and energy into <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>that</b> is not genetically his own. If this becomes public knowledge, the individual may also face public humiliation, and as a result this could reduce his social status and affect his future chances to reproduce. There are also ‘opportunity costs’; wherein the male could have been spending lost time pursuing alternative mating options.|$|E
25|$|Even {{after the}} 2013 reform, marital rape when {{the wife and}} husband live {{together}} continued {{not to be a}} crime in India. Article 376B of the 2013 law made forced sexual intercourse by a man with his wife – if she is living separately – a crime, whether under a decree of separation or otherwise, punishable with at least a 2-year prison term. Forced sex by a man on his wife may also be considered a prosecutable domestic violence under other sections of Indian Penal code, such as Section 498(A) as well as the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005. The crime of sexual assault on <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> <b>that</b> is anyone below the age of eighteen, is further outlined and mandatory punishments described in The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012.|$|E
