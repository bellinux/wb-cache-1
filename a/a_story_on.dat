5|$|Bennett {{declined}} the offer to be Dole's running mate but suggested Kemp, a man described as Dole's antagonist. On August 16, 1996, the Republican Party chose Kemp as its vice presidential , running alongside former Senator Dole. Kemp {{was seen as}} a means to attract conservative and libertarian-minded voters like those of tough nomination-challengers Forbes and Pat Buchanan. Kemp was chosen over Connie Mack, John McCain, and Carroll Campbell, and it is assumed that this was partly because Kemp had several former staffers in influential positions as Dole's senior advisors. Dole had had a long history of representing the budget-balancing faction of the Party, while Kemp had had a long history of representing the tax-cutting advocates, and Kemp's tax-cutting fiscal track record was seen as the perfect fit for the ticket. When Kemp became Dole's running mate in 1996, they appeared {{on the cover of the}} August 19, 1996 issue of Time magazine, but the pair barely edged out <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>on</b> the reported discovery of extraterrestrial life on Mars, which was so close to being the cover story that Time inset it on the cover and wrote about how difficult the decision was.|$|E

5|$|K. V. Vijayendra Prasad was {{watching}} a Marathi film where two warriors Sivaji and Tanaji are attacked by Mughal Army. Once the duo can reach Sinhagad fort, they can kill the army together effectively. While Sivaji escapes to the fort for support, Tanaji fights with the army and dies in the process leaving Sivaji in grief. Prasad took this as an inspiration and wrote <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>on</b> the theme of reincarnation of a bodyguard who serves a queen. He fights 100 warriors and dies {{in his attempt to}} re-enthrone his queen after she is overthrown by her conspirators. He is reborn after 400 years and fulfils his ambition of placing her on the throne by making her a Chief Minister or a popular social worker like Medha Patkar. It was subsequently rejected and after fifteen years, his son director S. S. Rajamouli selected this script, but made several changes to it. Rajamouli re-characterised the queen as a princess to create a vital love story for the film, as he felt that the relationship between a queen and a bodyguard would be only about loyalty and honesty.|$|E
