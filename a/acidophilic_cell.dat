40|$|Abstract Background Insulin-like-growth factor II (IGF II) {{has been}} implicated in the {{pathogenesis}} of neoplasm of different tissues, including liver of rats and men. This growth factor is believed to exert its effect during cellular proliferation. During the process of development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), different hepatic altered foci appear. They {{are believed to be}} the putative precursors of HCC in rats and in men. Thus, to study the role of the gene in a defined model of hepatocarcinogenesis was the target to elucidate its role in various cancer phenotypes during the entire development stage of cancer, right from earlier preneoplastic lesions to HCC Methods Antisense in situ hybridization technique was used here to characterize the type(s) of foci in which IGF II mRNA had expressed during the development of hepatocarcinogenesis-induced by diethylnitrosamine and promoted by phenobarbital in rats. Various focal lesions have been categorized depending on the stages and sizes along with IGF II expression patterns in them. Immunohistochemical detection for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was made to detect the role of the gene in preneoplastic and neoplastic cellular proliferation. Results IGF II expression was located in the glycogen-storage <b>acidophilic</b> <b>cell</b> foci maximally followed by mixed cell lesions and the least in basophilic lesions. The expression of IGF II was found to be predominant in the HCC. The expression of gene was also located at the peripheral cells of spongiosis hepatis which are believed to be the precursor of ito cell carcinoma. It was noted that there is a direct correlation between IGF II expression and Immunohistochemical detection for PCNA. Conclusion It may be concluded that IGF II gene expression plays an important role during the development of neoplasia and the gene expresses in the sequence of events leading from glycogen-rich-acidophilic lesions to glycogen poor basophilic lesions to HCC with an expression pattern of “high-low-high” in terms of degree of expression. Moreover, the essential role of the gene at the immediate initiation stage of carcinogenesis (first few weeks) and during HCC development cannot be ignored. Thus this expression {{can be used as a}} suitable marker for very early detection of the cancerous process and can save numbers of future cancer victims by very early detection of this disease. </p...|$|E

In mammotrophs, heavy PRL labeling was observed over secretory granule matrices (including the immature matrices at the trans Golgi surface) and also over Golgi cisternae. In contrast, in somatotrophs heavy GH labeling {{was restricted to}} the granule matrices; vesicles and tubules at the trans Golgi region showed some and the Golgi cisternae only sparse labeling. All somatotrophs and mammotrophs were heavily positive for GH and PRL, respectively, and were found to contain small amounts of the other hormone as well, which, however, was almost completely absent from granules, and was more concentrated in the Golgi complex, admixed with the predominant hormone. Mixed somatomammotrophs (approximately 26 % of the <b>acidophilic</b> <b>cells)</b> were heavily positive for both GH and PRL. Although admixed within Golgi cisternae, the two hormones were stored separately within distinct granule types. A third type of granule was found to contain SgII. Spillage of small amounts {{of each of the}} three secretory proteins into granules containing predominantly another protein was common, but true intermixing (i. e., coexistence within single granules of comparable amounts of two proteins) was very rare.

Materials were obtained during neurosurgical procedures. These were fixed in cold 1. 0 % OsO_ 4 solution buffered with veronal acetate, and embedded in methacrylate resin. The blocks were sectioned with the LKB 3314 A Sjostrand ultra-microtome and examined in an HS- 5 electron microscope (Hitachi). The results obtained are summarized as follows : 1) In both adenomas, tumor cells {{seem to be in}} close contact with each other, are irregular in shape, and are often attracted to the blood vessels. 2) In the acidophilic adenoma, multinucleated and giant cells can be often seen, while tumor cells of the chromophobic adenomas are generally small. 3) The nuclei of the acidophilic adenomas are often irregular in shape. 4) In both adenoma cells, the nuclei are homogeneous and dense, filled with fine granules, and nucleoli can be often observed. 5) The cells of both adenomas contain secretory granules of homogeneous electron density. Almost all of the chromophobic adenoma cells contain only a few granules, while the <b>acidophilic</b> adenoma <b>cells</b> generally contain more-granules. The number of the granules in the <b>acidophilic</b> adenoma <b>cells</b> varied from that of the densely granulated cells to cells resembling chromophobic cells in the normal adenohypophysis of the animals. 6) In both adenoma cells, the size of secretory granules is 50 〜 300 mμ in diameter and is not constant. Some <b>cells</b> resemble the <b>acidophilic</b> <b>cells</b> and others, the basophilic cells in the normal adenohypophysis of the animals. 7) The endoplasrnic reticulum is well developed in many of the <b>acidophilic</b> adenoma <b>cells.</b> In the chromophobic adenoma cells, the vacuolated endoplasrnic reticulum is extremely developed. 8) Mitochondria and the Golgi apparatus can be seen in both adenoma cells but their distribution, quantity, and size vary in each cell. 9) In addition, in the case of acidophilic adenoma, the polygonal cells with very electron dense nuclei and cytoplasm are rarely observed. Furthermore, in the chromophobic adenomas, the largely vacuolated giant cells with less dense cytoplasm, dense cells, and the small cells with large granules near the blood capillaries are sometimes observed. 10) In the acidophilic adenoma, almost all of the blood vessels are sinusoid surrounded by the electron dense perisinusoidal space.

40|$|A {{description}} is given {{of the structure}} and vascularization of the lampern gill. A comparison of the cellular components of the gill epithelium taken from lamperns at various stages of their spawning migration show that certain types of cells are common to all animals.

40|$|ABSTRACT The ultrastructural {{localization}} {{of growth}} hormone and prolactin in cow anterior pituitary was studied by double immunocytochemical labeling using specific antibodies and protein A-gold particles of different sizes. The two hormones {{were found in}} specific somatotrophs and mammotrophs {{as well as in}} somatomammotropic cells which were multinucleated and predominantly arranged in clusters in the central area of the Iobules. In these mixed cells the two hormones were packaged (a) in different granules of the same cell, (b) in the same granules where they were segregated in different portions of the granule content, or (c) in the same granules but evenly intermixed. The relative proportion of these three types of granules varied in somatomammotrophs of different animals. A single large Golgi complex was generally present in somatomammotrophs. Small, immature granules containing either growth hormone or prolactin or both hormones were found randomly distributed along Golgi stacks. This suggests that in these cells the two hormones are processed in the same Golgi cisternae and that mechanism(s) exist(s) to sort out the two hormones from each other. <b>Acidophilic</b> <b>cells</b> of the anterior pituitary have been amon...|$|R

Rats with hypercholecystokininaemia that {{had had a}} pancreaticobiliary diversion (PBD) operation and sham operated rats served as controls. Fundectomised rats showed {{a significant increase in}} pancreatic weight and total DNA and protein content compared with sham operated rats. DNA flow cytometry showed a significantly higher ratio of tetraploid to diploid nuclei in pancreatic tissue after fundectomy than after sham operation. Mean values of all these variables were significantly lower after fundectomy than after PBD. <b>Acidophilic</b> atypical acinar <b>cell</b> foci of the pancreas were diagnosed in both fundectomised and PBD operated rats, but not in sham operated controls. The volume density and 3 H-thymidine labelling index of the <b>acidophilic</b> atypical acinar <b>cell</b> foci were significantly lower after fundectomy than after PBD. Changes consistent with pancreatic adenoma were diagnosed in the PBD group only.

There is, however, proof of its apocrine and paracrine function of cellular growth factor, a function enhancing mitogenesis and lymphocyte differentiation at the site of inflammation and thereby their own production of yet other mediators and immunomodulators - including interleukines (IL) and growth factors. PRL also directly interferes with the synthesis of some acute-phase proteins in the liver (stimulating, e. g., alpha- 2 -macroglobulin synthesis).

40|$|An {{hereditary}} type of dwarfism in {{the rabbit}} has been described. In {{contrast to the}} dwarfs described in other animals, this type is evident at birth and conforms to the classification, nannosomia primordialis, as used in human pathology. In homozygous form the variation is lethal and produces a miniature individual approximately one-third {{the size of its}} normal sibs. Heterozygous animals are approximately two-thirds the size of normal sibs at birth and never attain an equal stature. The expression of the variation is modified by genetic factors carried by a line of cretinoid animals and, rarely, dwarfs derived from crosses with this line survive for 1 to 2 months. The striking changes in such survivors are hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the <b>acidophilic</b> <b>cells</b> of the pituitary and atrophy of the gonads. Such changes are not present in ordinary dwarfs and it is concluded that the acidophilic hyperplasia represents the influence of the modifying factors of the cretinoid line and supplies the growth hormone responsible for survival. The gonadotropic hormone is not supplied by the secretory activity of these cells and as a result the gonads atrophy. The evidence at hand indicates that the primary effect of the dwarfing gene is an inhibition of the secretory functions of the pituitary. In homozygous individuals, the inhibition is complete and the variation is expressed as a lethal dwarf. In heterozygous animals, the function of the organ is altered, producing an undersized individual. The modifying factors of the cretinoid line act either to partially remove the inhibition or to alter the constitution of the animal so that life is possible for a short period without the full complement of pituitary hormones...|$|R
40|$|A {{role for}} glucocorticosteroids in the {{evolution}} of the fetal liver erythron in vivo has been proposed. If direct, such an intervention implies the presence of receptor sites in the cells of the erythroid cell lines. To test this hypothesis cell suspensions were prepared from liver haematopoietic tissue obtained from rat fetuses aged 13, 14, 17 and 20 days. Their composition was determined by light microscopy. The populations consisted essentially of cells of the erythroid line: juvenile cell types (progenitor and basophilic cells) predominated in tissue collected at 13 and 14 days of gestation, more mature types (polychromatic and <b>acidophilic</b> <b>cells)</b> became more abundant at 17 and 20 days of gestation. Suppressible binding of glucocorticosteroid at 4 =deg studied on these suspensions, using[3 H]dexamethasone. Binding sites were found at all stages of gestation studied. The mean number per cell (for the entire erythroid population) was roughly 3600, 3500, 2300 and 1700 at 13, 14, 17 and 20 days of gestation respectively, without any change in the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd: 5 =. =x 0 =- to 6 =. =x 0 =- mol/l). Suspensions contain-ing essentially progenitor cells were prepared from erythropoietic cells from livers obtained at 14 and 16 days of gestation, using a rabbit immune serum against rat erythrocytes in the presence of an excess of complement. These cells had 1800 and 1600 receptor sites per cell respectively (same Kd as above). No receptors were found on circulating adult or fetal erythrocytes. The results strongly suggest that there is an uneven distribution of the number of the glucocorticosteroid binding sites per cell amongst the different cell types of the erythroid line.

The employment, in particular, of cells from mouse tumour ascitic fluids to support the growth of viruses (1 - 3) and in biochemical work involving homogenisation and the preparation of cell fractions (4, 5) made it appear that a study defining the fine structure of the cells in such mouse tumour exudates, would be of value. The ascites form of mouse Sarcoma 37 was selected to start the work, since electron microscope observations had already been made on fresh, thinly spread whole ceils from it (6). In addition, this ascites tumour,: among other peculiarities, was known to produce a high percentage of reaction cells in its ascitic fluids (7, 8), many of them <b>acidophilic</b> peritoneal <b>cells.</b> Since the turnout cells were basophilic, an electron microscope investigation of the morphology of the cell population in Sarcoma 37 ascitic fluids using thin sectioning techniques...|$|R
40|$|The tumour {{cells and}} the {{reaction}} cells in Sarcoma 37 ascitic fluids have been studied in thin sections with the electron microscope. The reaction cells were either leucocytes or much larger <b>acidophilic</b> peritoneal <b>cells</b> of the same dimensions as the tumour cells; the peritoneal cells formed as much as 20 per cent of the large cell population. The fine structure of the cells is described and some new observations recorded. It {{has been found that}} the cell membrane of eosinophil granulocytes has a laminated composition and the characteristic granules of these cells a double limiting membrane. The pores in the double nuclear membrane of the peritoneal cells have been observed to have a fine line running across them. In the tumour cells, a rounded granular body with a central dense area has been found in the region of the centrosome; these cells were also seen to contain rows of parallel smooth surfaced cisternae lying 150 mµ apart similar to those hitherto only observed in spermatids. There was a feltwork of fine filaments in the cytoplasm of the centrosome region of the tumour cells. The cytoplasmic fine structure underlying the basophilia of the tumour cells and the acidophilia of the peritoneal cells is compared and discussed...|$|R
40|$|THE HEMATOPOIETIC and {{immune systems}} are {{reported}} to be modulated by various neuropeptides (1 – 7). Neuropeptides, such as substance P and substance K, were reported to induce the release of interleukin (IL) - 1, tumor necrosis factor-�, and IL- 6 from human blood monocytes (3). The DW/J dwarf mice, which lack <b>acidophilic</b> anterior pituitary <b>cells</b> and are deficient in GH and other anterior pituitary-derived hormones, were found to exhibit {{a decrease in the}} number of peripheral blood cells including erythroid, myeloid, and lymphoid lineages (4, 5). Recently, it was reported that the high level of messenger RNA (mRNA) for neuropeptide Y was expressed in B cell precursor lymphoblasts from acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, implying a role of neuropeptide Y in B cell development and/or pathologic disorders of B cells (6). However, the precise roles of individual neuropeptides in regulating hematopoietic system are not yet elucidated...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of LEW and F 344 strain rats to the pancreatic carcinogen azaserine was compared using {{the size and}} number of azaserine-induced <b>acidophilic</b> acinar <b>cell</b> foci and nodules as parameters in a 4 -month experiment. A second experiment compared the effect of corn oil intake by gavage and dietary routes on the growth of azaserine-induced pancreatic lesions in LEW rats. A third experiment tested the activity of benzyl acetate in regard to its ability to induce acinar cell foci or to promote the growth of such foci in azaserine-treated rats. The results showed that equivalent doses of azaserine induce two to seven times more foci in LEW than in F 344 rats, and that LEW rats have {{a higher incidence of}} "spontaneous" foci than F 344 rats. Azaserine-treated LEW rats that were given 5 mL corn oil/kg body weight 5 days per week by gavage developed more acinar cell foci than rats fed a basal diet (chow). Addition of an equivalent amount of corn oil to chow had a similar effect of enhancing the development of foci. Rats of neither strain developed acinar cell foci when benzyl acetate was given by gavage or in the diet nor was there evidence that benzyl acetate has a significant effect on the development of foci in azaserine-treated rats. These studies also demonstrate that the azaserine/rat model of pancreatic carcinogenesis which was developed in LEW rats can be adapted for use with F 344 rats...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{cholecystokinin}} in dietary fat-promoted pancreatic carcinogenesis {{was investigated}} in azaserine-treated rats, using lorglumide, a highly specific cholecystokinin-receptor antagonist. The animals were killed 8 months {{after the start of}} treatment. Cholecystokinin, but not dietary unsaturated fat, increased pancreatic weight. Rats treated with cholecystokinin developed more <b>acidophilic</b> atypical acinar <b>cell</b> nodules, adenomas and adenocarcinomas than control animals. Rats maintained on the high-fat diet developed significantly more adenomas and adenocarcinomas than controls given a diet low in unsaturated fat. Lorglumide largely inhibited the enhancing effect of cholecystokinin, but not of dietary fat, on pancreatic carcinogenesis indicating that {{it is unlikely that the}} promoting effect of dietary unsaturated fat on pancreatic carcinogenesis is mediated via cholecystokinin. Chemicals/CAS: azaserine, 115 - 02 - 6; cholecystokinin, 9011 - 97 - 6, 93443 - 27 - 7; lorglumide, 97964 - 56 - 2; Azaserine, 115 - 02 - 6; Cholecystokinin, 9011 - 97 - 6; Dietary Fats; lorglumide, 97964 - 56 - 2; Proglumide, 6620 - 60 - 6; Receptors, Cholecystokini...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} enthalpy of combustion of <b>acidophilic,</b> iron-oxidising lithotrophic <b>cells</b> {{was determined to}} be − 23. 98 kJ g(cells) − 1. This value is identical to that reported for the enthalpy of combustion for the bacteria E. coli and M. methylophilus. Using an average value for the standard entropy of formation of cell mass gave a Gibbs energy for the growth reaction of + 57 kJ equiv− 1. This figure is significantly different from that previously reported. The ability of iron-oxidising cells to produce biomass is evaluated in terms of a thermodynamic model. The theoretical yield of biomass was found to be most sensitive cytoplasmic pH and to the value of the Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + couple (E° 2). E° 2 is in turn dependent on the speciation of iron in solution and process water quality. The observed yields of cell mass are ca. 30 % of the maximum theoretical yield calculated from thermodynamic principles...|$|R
40|$|Two {{cases of}} yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic adverse events (YEL-AVD) were {{identified}} by review of correspondence received at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Ft. Collins, CO). The cases occurred in Indiana and Maryland in 1973 and 1978, respectively. One patient, a 75 -year-old man with multi-organ failure died, and the other, a 31 -year-old woman, was hospitalized for 14 days. Onset was 3 – 6 days after vaccination. The illness was characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic and renal dysfunction, and (in the fatal case), shock and coagulopathy, compatible with YEL-AVD. Liver pathology showed diffuse, spotty necrosis, <b>acidophilic</b> degeneration, Kupffer <b>cell</b> hyperplasia, and microvesicular fat. No virological confirmation was obtained, so that both cases remain classified as “suspect. ” The 1973 case is the earliest record of YEL-AVD; until now, the earliest known case of YEL-AVD had been in 1975 in Brazil, and most subsequent cases have been reported after 1995...|$|R
