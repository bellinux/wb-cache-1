Rohde responded [...] "You have to understand, it's a giant complicated machine sitting on top of, like, a 46-foot tall tower {{in the middle of a}} finished building. So, it's really hard to fix, but we are working on it. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> work on it.

60|$|March.--Embarked on an {{excursion}} to Paestum, with Sir William Gell and Mr. Laing-Meason, {{in order}} to see the fine ruins. We went out by Pompeii, which we had visited before, and which fully maintains its character {{as one of the most}} striking pieces of antiquity, where the furniture treasure and household are preserved in the excavated houses, just as found by the labourers appointed by Government. The inside of the apartments is adorned with curious paintings, if I may call them such, in mosaic. A meeting between Darius and Alexander is remarkably fine.[520] A street, called the street of Tombs, reaches a considerable way out of the city, having been flanked by tombs on each side as the law directed. The entrance into the town affords an interesting picture of the private life of the Romans. We came next to the vestiges of Herculaneum, which is destroyed like Pompeii but by the lava or molten stone, which cannot be removed, whereas the tufa or volcanic ashes can be with ease removed from Pompeii, which it has filled up lightly. After having refreshed in a cottage in the desolate town, we proceed on our journey eastward, flanked by one set of heights stretching from Vesuvius, and forming a prolongation of that famous mountain. Another chain of mountains seems to intersect our course in an opposite direction and descends upon the town of Castellamare. Different from the range of heights which is prolonged from Vesuvius, this second, which runs to Castellamare, is entirely composed of granite, and, as is always the case with mountains of this formation, betrays no trace of volcanic agency. Its range was indeed broken and split up into specimens of rocks of most romantic appearance and great variety, displaying granite rock as the principal part of its composition. The country on which these hills border is remarkable for its powers of vegetation, and produces vast groves of vine, elm, chestnut, and similar trees, which grow when stuck in by cuttings. The vines produce Lacryma Christi in great quantities--not a bad wine, though the stranger requires to be used to it. The sea-shore of the Bay of Naples forms the boundary on the right of the country through which our journey lies, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> approach to the granite chain of eminences which stretch before us, as if to bar our passage.|$|E
