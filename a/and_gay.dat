5|$|AIDS {{was first}} {{clinically}} observed in 1981 in the United States. The initial cases were {{a cluster of}} injection drug users <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems. Soon thereafter, additional gay men developed a previously rare skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Many more cases of PCP and KS emerged, alerting U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak. The earliest retrospectively described case of AIDS {{is believed to have}} been in Norway beginning in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Although {{homosexuality}} among females {{has taken}} place in many cultures in history, a recent phenomenon is the development of family among same-sex partners. Before the 1970s, the idea that same-sex adults formed long-term committed relationships was unknown to many people. The majority of lesbians (between 60% and 80%) report being in a long-term relationship. Sociologists credit the high number of paired women to gender role socialization: the inclination for women to commit to relationships doubles in a lesbian union. Unlike heterosexual relationships that tend to divide work based on sex roles, lesbian relationships divide chores evenly between both members. Studies have also reported that emotional bonds are closer in lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> relationships than heterosexual ones.|$|E

Delany, Marion Zimmer Bradley and Melissa Scott. However, such meetings did not necessarily indicate whole-hearted acceptance within the fan community, <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> and lesbian fans were not regarded as a unified interest group. Informal gatherings at conferences and the attempted creation of a newsletter for LGBT fans drew little notice.|$|E

5|$|In Hall's time, Paris {{was known}} for having a {{relatively}} large and visible gay and lesbian communityâ€“ in part because France, unlike England, had no laws against male homosexuality. Marcel Proust's novels continued in their influence upon 1920s Parisian society depicting lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> subculture. When Stephen first travels to Paris, {{at the urging of}} her friend Jonathan Brockettâ€“ who may be based on NoÃ«l Cowardâ€“ she has not yet spoken about her inversion to anyone.

40|$|Attitudes toward lesbians <b>and</b> <b>gays</b> vary across {{national}} populations, and {{previous research has}} found relatively more accepting attitudes in the Netherlands {{as compared to the}} United States. In this study, we compared beliefs about and attitudes toward lesbians <b>and</b> <b>gays</b> in samples of Dutch and American heterosexual adolescents, utilizing survey data from 1, 080 American adolescents (mean age = 15. 86 years) attending two schools and from 1, 391 Dutch adolescents (mean age = 16. 27 years) attending eight schools. Findings indicated the Dutch participants were more tolerant of lesbians <b>and</b> <b>gays,</b> after adjusting for the gender, age, and racial/ethnic minority status of the participants. However, between-country differences were attenuated by accounting for the beliefs about lesbians <b>and</b> <b>gays</b> that participants used to justify their attitudes. American participants were more likely to justify their attitudes using beliefs related to social norms and religious opposition, while the Dutch participants were more likely to justify their attitudes using beliefs related to individual rights and the biological/genetic basis of homosexuality. The results suggest that the relative importance of particular beliefs about lesbians <b>and</b> <b>gays</b> to attitudes at the group level may be context dependent but also that certain beliefs are salient to attitudes {{across national}} contexts...|$|R
