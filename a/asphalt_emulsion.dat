40|$|PURPOSES: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the effect of physical characteristics of <b>emulsion</b> <b>asphalt</b> and aggregate on performance of chip seal pavements. METHODS: In order to evaluate the performance of chip seal materials, the sweep tests and Vialit Plate Shock tests were conducted on the mixtures with five <b>emulsion</b> <b>asphalt</b> binders and three aggregate types. The sweep tests was intended to investigate the change of bonding properties between <b>emulsion</b> <b>asphalt</b> and aggregate with curing time. The Vialit Plate Shock test was used to evaluate the bonding properties of chip seal materials at low temperatures. RESULTS:Results from sweep tests showed that polymer modified <b>emulsion</b> <b>asphalt</b> can reduce the curing time by 1. 5 hour comparing with typical <b>emulsion</b> <b>asphalt.</b> It is also found that the Flakiness Index of aggregates and absorption rate of binder are the major factors affecting the bonding properties of chip seal materials. The Vialit Plate Shock test results showed that the average aggregate loss of CRS- 2 is ten times higher than CRS- 2 P No. 2 indicating that the use of polymer additives in <b>emulsion</b> <b>asphalt</b> can improve the performance of chip seal materials in low temperature region. CONCLUSIONS: The use of polymer in <b>emulsion</b> <b>asphalt</b> can decrease the curing time of chip seal materials and increase the bonding properties between aggregates and asphalt binder.

40|$|This {{project was}} an effort to better {{characterize}} <b>asphalt</b> <b>emulsions</b> that are typically used in cold in-place recycling (CIR) applications. A simple approach was presented that treated the cured residue as asphalt binder and applied the standard Superpave specifications to the material. A literature review examined methods that have historically been used to produce, characterize, and apply <b>asphalt</b> <b>emulsions.</b> Four emulsions were tested in this project: CRS- 2 P, CSS- 1, EE, and HFMS- 2 P. The emulsions were cured two ways, the first being allowed to sit overnight in a pan at room temperature, and the second being a modified RTFOT approach. Air cured samples were also aged in the PAV. These residues were then tested with the BBR and DT at low temperatures and with the DSR at high and intermediate temperatures. AASHTO MP 1 specifications were applied in order to characterize the emulsions by PG grade. Following this, AASHTO MP 1 a specifications were followed in order to find the critical cracking temperature of the emulsions. Master curves were constructed from the DSR tests of complex shear modulus vs. frequency. Finally, a sample mix design was presented using these emulsions and an empirical equation to predict the dynamic modulus of the mixture. Local Road Research Boar...|$|R

5000|$|Warm mix asphalt {{concrete}} (commonly abbreviated as WMA) {{is produced by}} adding either zeolites, waxes, <b>asphalt</b> <b>emulsions,</b> or sometimes even water to the asphalt binder prior to mixing.

The usage of these additives in hot mixed asphalt (above) may afford easier compaction and allow cold weather paving or longer hauls. Use of warm mix is rapidly expanding.

40|$|One {{remediation}} {{option for}} metal contaminated soil {{is to consider}} the use of waste containing soils to serve as aggregate for construction purposes. The resulting product should pass the requisite RPA regulatory leaching test (TCLP: Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure) and be less available to receptors for environmental reasons and have suitable physical properties for construction purposes such as road base, covers, berms, and fill. The incorporation of petroleum contaminated soils into asphalt for reuse is becoming more common.

40|$|International audienceWhen a {{caustic soda}} {{solution}} is slowly {{added up to}} a cationic oil-in-water emulsion, prepared with dodecylamine as surfactant, the chemical equilibrium is altered. As a consequence, a progressive viscosity diminution is observed until complete emulsion destabilization. Original cationic emulsions are stable thanks to the droplet electrical double layer formed by the ionized surfactant adsorption on the liquid interface at very low pH values. However, the alkali addition changes the chemical equilibrium in different ways, such as reducing the hydronium ion concentration, allowing for dodecylamine deionization and increasing the ionic species concentration. These changes {{and the fact that}} the emulsion's droplet size and distribution remain constant (noticed by granulometric measurements) during the process, let us assuming that viscosity decreases as a consequence of the overall positive layer charge diminution. However, emulsion destabilization can be explained in terms of some formulation parameters such like SAD or HLD.

40|$|International audienceThe use of <b>asphalt</b> <b>emulsions</b> {{for road}} {{fabrication}} is rapidly gaining in importance mainly due to energy savings, less environmental impact, and better {{properties of the}} final product. However, the formulation of these emulsions still requires a better understanding, particularly concerning their breaking phenomena. When a cationic model emulsion is contacted with a solid having a negative-charged surface, physicochemical driving forces result in the emulsion destabilization. As a consequence, a viscosity reduction of the remaining emulsion is observed, {{as well as the}} emulsion breakup through a heteroflocculation mechanism provided the solid surface is large enough. Emulsion systems at equilibrium, containing cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), paraffin oil, and Fontainebleau's sandstone powder and having different droplet sizes, are studied. The results show that the dispersed oil fraction decreases after each addition of sandstone aliquots, and this depends on the concentration of CPC in the continuous phase of the emulsion. As the droplet size and distribution remain constant during the process, it is assumed that the emulsion heteroflocculation is the result of direct oil droplets adhesion on the sand surface, followed by their coalescence around the sand particles...|$|R
