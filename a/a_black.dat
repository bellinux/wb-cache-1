5|$|<b>A</b> <b>black</b> hole is {{a region}} of spacetime exhibiting such strong {{gravitational}} effects that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form <b>a</b> <b>black</b> hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed. In many ways <b>a</b> <b>black</b> hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.|$|E

5|$|A tidal {{disruption}} {{event of}} this sort is when a star interacts with a supermassive black hole shredding the star, {{and in some cases}} creating a relativistic jet which produces bright emission of gamma ray radiation.

5|$|Although the State Arms {{were granted}} in 1969, {{municipal}} heraldry {{had already been}} using the black swan symbolism since 1926, when the coat of arms of Perth were granted with <b>a</b> <b>black</b> swan as a charge {{in the first quarter}} and black swan supporters. This was followed by Northam (1953, black swan crest) and Bunbury (1959, black swan crest). Following the grant of the State Arms, municipal arms continued this tradition: Fremantle (1971, charge), Gosnells (1978, charge), Melville (1981, supporters) and Subiaco (1984, crest).

Fear of <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Planet explores themes about organization and empowerment within the black community, social issues affecting African Americans, and race relations at the time.
