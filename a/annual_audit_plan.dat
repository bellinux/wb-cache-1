It presents and discusses the definition of internal auditing by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA). Other relevant disciplines are also included - external audit and assurance. The importance of these disciplines is demonstrated in the example of Enron. The thesis presents the International Professional Practices Framework, especially its key components - standards. The end of this section is devoted to {{a description of the}} individual parts of an internal audit project. The second part is dedicated to planning internal audit engagements. Planning is based on the risks, therefore, there is a description of banking risks.

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: A {{technique}} {{that may be}} used to incorporate Risk Based Internal Auditing (RBIA) in the IT environment is to follow <b>annual</b> <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> methodology steps. The IT infrastructure elements are linked to the business processes which they support. Their ranking are based on the risk assessments of the business process, the business process priority, the dependency of the business process on IT and the IT infrastructure element’s own risk assessment. CobiT is used as an auditing method, i. e. best practice guidance to audit against...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to offer an overview over risk management cycle by focusing on prioritization and treatment, in order to ensure an integrated approach to risk management and assessment, and establish the â€˜top 8 - 12 â€™ risks report within the organization. The interface with Internal Audit is ensured by the implementation of the scoring method to prioritize risks collected from previous generated risk report. Methodology/approach: Using evidence from other research in the area and the professional expertise, this article outlines an integrated approach to risk assessment and risk management reporting processes, by separating the risk in two main categories: strategic and operational risks. The focus is on risk prioritization and scoring; the final output will comprise a mix of strategic and operational (â€˜top 8 - 12 â€™) risks, which should be used to establish the annual Internal Audit plan. Originality/value: By using an integrated approach to risk assessment and risk management will eliminate the need for a separate Internal Audit risk assessment over prevailing risks. It will reduce the level of risk assessment overlap by different functions (Tax, Treasury, Information System) over the same risk categories as a single methodology, is used and will align timings of risk assessment exercises. The risk prioritization by usage of risk and control scoring criteria highlights the combination between financial and non-financial impact criteria allowing risks that do not naturally lend themselves to a financial amount to be also assessed consistently. It is emphasized the usage of score method to prioritize the risks included in the <b>annual</b> <b>audit</b> <b>plan</b> in order to increase accuracy and timelines...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse company-specific factors {{associated}} with adoption of risk-based auditing. It seeks to explore the role of internal auditing in enterprise risk management (ERM). Design/methodology/approach – Findings are drawn from a questionnaire survey, sent in 2006, to all 96 chief internal auditors who were members of the Institute of Portuguese Internal Auditors. Findings – In planning an <b>annual</b> schedule of <b>audits,</b> the adoption of a risk-based approach is statistically significant in international firms (p= 0. 05) and companies listed on the Portuguese stock market (p= 0. 10). There is a strong (but not significant) association between risk-based <b>annual</b> <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> and entities which are private, in the finance sector, and large. In <b>planning</b> each <b>audit</b> engagement, adoption of a risk-based approach is correlated positively with entity size. Internal auditing is more proactive in the implementation of ERM in smaller organisations, and is more important in the finance industry and the private sector. Practical implications – A better understanding emerges of factors associated with the adoption of risk-based auditing, together with an enhanced appreciation of the role of internal auditing in ERM. Originality/value – The paper reveals the specific characteristics of companies that are associated with the adoption of risk-based approaches in the internal audit process. It is the first paper published about risk-based internal auditing in Portugal. Internal auditing, Portugal, Risk management...|$|R

40|$|The use of share {{incentive}} schemes {{as part of}} the remuneration structure for the head of internal audit or the Chief Audit Executive (CAE) is one mechanism available to a company to incentivise its senior executives and to ensure they add value to the company they manage. This can however lead to challenges as internal auditors have always had to fulfil two contradictory roles: being an employee in a company and being an objective person involved in rendering independent assurance services for the same company. It is, therefore, important for internal auditors to strike the correct balance that ensures they are perceived as sufficiently independent to achieve their objectives in terms of the <b>annual</b> internal <b>audit</b> <b>plan.</b> Care must also be taken to ensure that the share incentives do not have a negative influence on the level (or perceived level) of independence and objectivity the CAE demonstrates. This is the first South African study to investigate the use of share {{incentive schemes}} for CAEs. This study used structured interviews in a multiple case study approach to identify the views of the chairpersons of audit committees (CACs) on the use of share incentive schemes for their CAEs. The study found that share incentive schemes were used to incentivise CAEs mostly over the medium term. The study also found that although the CACs had little oversight over the remuneration of the CAEs, they nevertheless did consider the use of share incentive schemes to be an acceptable remuneration mechanism.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether country (Australia or Japan) and client type (public sector or private sector) impact the auditor's client risk assessments, {{subsequent}} <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> decisions (<b>planned</b> <b>audit</b> hours) and <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> responsiveness to client risk assessments. Design/methodology/approach – The study is based on previously developed <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> models and uses working paper-sourced data of planned auditor effort and nine client risk assessments. The study samples are taken from public and private sector audit engagements of two major audit firms in Australia and Japan, respectively. Findings – Evidence is found that country and client type do have an impact on the auditor's client risk assessments and <b>planned</b> total <b>audit</b> hours, but they do not moderate <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> responsiveness to client risk assessments. Research limitations/implications – The test variable is confounded by the country and client type characteristics inherent in the study's samples. If the differences are caused by country, this suggests that <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> decisions vary across countries, even when the same auditing standards are adopted. However, if they are caused by client type, this suggests that the same audit approach (i. e. the audit risk model) is applied differently depending on client characteristics. Practical implications – These findings are useful to international standard setters, audit practice quality control and training, and audit research. Originality/value – No prior study has examined the role of country and client type on the auditor's client risk assessments and <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> decisions. Further, no prior study has examined whether the relationship between the auditor's client risk assessments and <b>audit</b> <b>planning</b> decisions is moderated by country and client type. <b>Audit</b> <b>planning,</b> <b>Audit</b> risk model, Australia, Client risk assessments, Country and client-type, Japan, Private sector, Public sector...|$|R
