25|$|In October 1887 Portal {{was ordered}} to attempt a {{reconciliation}} between the king of Abyssinia and the Italian government. To succeed in such a mission was almost impossible, but he made every effort, and showed rare judgement and coolness in travelling through a disturbed country. He returned on 31 December, without effecting his purpose, but with a considerably enhanced reputation. He was made CB, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Mission to Abyssinia (1888) he gave {{an account of the}} expedition.|$|E

500|$|Following the match, Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{claimed that}} the gesture he made had been {{intended}} for the media and not Liverpool fans: [...] "The signal of close your mouth was not for them but for the press, they speak too much <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion they try to do everything to disturb Chelsea. Wait, don't speak too soon. We lost two matches <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion you (the media) try to take confidence from us and put pressure on us." [...] Mourinho was happy that Chelsea had won but said the victory was not special: [...] "It's just one more. I had a few before this, I'm very happy to win. It's important for the fans, for the club and especially for the players." [...] Striker Eiður Guðjohnsen said Chelsea's victory was down to their hard work ethic: [...] "It was a very intense and even game {{and it was hard}} to break them down, but hard work pays off in the end." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s {{until her death}} in 2002, Howard {{returned}} to her lifelong fascination with light, night skies, the reflective surface of water. In these last paintings, there is a recurrence of circular elements, an abstraction of natural forms and a balancing of darkness and light. [...] Howard has stated: [...] "In my painting (as in all my work) I am deeply involved with light as the movement and inter-action of colours; the integrity of colour and form, hence with {{the integrity of the}} total work which has to do with spirit and abstract essence, not representation. I am preoccupied with life's ambiguities and dualities <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> later work I am reaching more and more from the dark toward light, freedom, and a transcending exuberance." ...|$|E
500|$|Ne-Yo's third album, Year of the Gentleman, was {{released}} internationally on August 5, 2008. Speaking to noted UK R writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning Blues & Soul, Ne-Yo explained the thinking behind its title: [...] "To me Year of the Gentleman {{is all about}} a persona, a swag and a charm. I made {{an assessment of the}} music business. <b>And,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> personal opinion, the essence of the gentleman is absent right now. Everybody kinda looks the same, everybody's kinda doing the same thing, everybody's kinda rude and full of themselves. Whereas a gentleman is calm, courteous, kind, charming... So that title basically represents me trying to lead by example, and showing these cats {{what it is to be}} a gentleman in this business still." ...|$|E

[...] Yang's friendship with Meredith has been looked upon as [...] "sisterhood", and Yang has repeatedly referred to the former as [...] "her person". This led to the two being dubbed [...] "the twisted sisters". At the conclusion of season three, the duo went on a [...] "honeymoon" [...] together, and Rhimes called it her favorite detail of the finale.|$|E

500|$|Marina Sirtis, {{who played}} Lwaxana's {{daughter}} Deanna Troi on the show, [...] thought that compared to earlier episodes, [...] "Half a Life" [...] showed a different {{side of her}} character's mother. Lwaxana's interactions in the episode, argues Sirtis, considerably broadened the character; previous episodes {{had a tendency to}} become centered around Deanna and Lwaxana. Sirtis and director Les Landau felt that the plot of [...] "Half a Life" [...] resembled a morality play. [...] Landau noted the similarity between the episode and the morality play-style plots that franchise creator Gene Roddenberry included in [...] [...] "It deals with the whole issue of growing old and how society deals with the elderly <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind, {{it was one of the}} most pertinent story-lines I have done", Landau recalled.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Häkkinen stated that his good start was instigated by modifications made to his car's engine. His win was praised by the Vice President of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport Norbert Haug. [...] "Mika had a great race," [...] he said. [...] "His victory may have looked easy, but {{it was tough to}} achieve <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> view this was one of his best drives ever." [...] Michael Schumacher said that although he was unable to catch Häkkinen, he was happy to finish in second position. Coulthard said that he believed that his car's suffered from balance issues before taking his first pit stop which accounted for his lack of pace. He also added that spending time behind back-markers during the second stint hindered his attempts to overtake Michael Schumacher but admitted that third position was his best possible result.|$|E
500|$|Explaining how Ben Stiller {{came to be}} cast in {{the role}} of Greg, Roach states: [...] "I saw Meet the Parents as an anxiety dream, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> view nobody plays that kind of {{material}} better than Ben." [...] Additionally, Roach was impressed with Stiller's creative and ad lib abilities stating that [...] "he has lots of great ideas and he's very skilled at loose improvisation." [...] Stiller's character Gaylord [...] "Greg" [...] Focker is a nurse who loves his girlfriend and tries desperately to impress her parents by any means which includes telling harmless little lies which are then covered up with bigger lies and elaborate cover-up schemes. The film's script was initially written with Jim Carrey {{in the role of}} Greg and contained much more physical comedy, something that Stiller did not think would be successful with himself playing the role. This resulted in deletion of some scenes but also in introduction of at least one unscripted scene that was completely improvised by Stiller. Roach cast Stiller only after it became clear that Carrey would not be taking on the role.|$|E

500|$|Hanna's {{associates}} {{alleged that}} Bushnell had delayed {{the appointment of}} Hanna so that Foraker could be Ohio's senior senator. [...] Herbert Croly, in his biography of Hanna, agreed, and McKinley biographer H.Wayne Morgan also states that Bushnell delayed Hanna's commission for this reason. Hanna biographer William Horner considers this motive possible. [...] In his memoirs, Foraker denied this, stating that Sherman had not resigned from the Senate until the afternoon of March4, 1897 (the date on which the president and Congress were sworn in) so that Sherman could formally introduce Foraker to the Senate. [...] Sherman, according to Foraker, was also unwilling to resign until he had been confirmed as Secretary of State, which {{took place on the}} afternoon of March4. [...] Foraker noted that he had been senator-elect since his selection by the legislature in January 1896 [...] "and there was no vacancy for which Mr. Hanna could be qualified, except only that to be created by the retirement of Mr. Sherman, and Mr. Sherman refused to retire until I was sworn <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> seat".|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the betting scandal, Stern revised the {{guidelines}} on the behavior of NBA referees during the Board of Governors' meeting in 2007. Despite the labor agreement for referees, which restricted them from participating in almost all forms of gambling, it was revealed that about half of the NBA's officials had made bets in casinos, albeit not with sportsbooks. In addition, almost all referees had admitted to engaging in some form of gambling. Stern stated that [...] " [...] ban on gambling is absolute, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> view it is too absolute, too harsh and was not particularly well-enforced over the years". The gambling rules were revised to allow referees to engage in several forms of betting—though not on sports. There were several other referee-related rule changes made: the announcement of referees of a game was moved from 90 minutes before tip-off to the morning of the game, to reduce the value of the information to gamblers; referees received more in-season training and counseling [...] on gambling; more thorough background checks were carried out; the league declared its intention to analyze the statistical relationship between NBA games and referees' gambling patterns for those games; and the interactions between referees and NBA teams were made easier and more formal.|$|E
500|$|Bain Capital's {{leveraged}} buyouts sometimes led to layoffs, either {{soon after}} acquisition or later after {{the firm had}} concluded its role. Exactly how many jobs Bain Capital added compared to those lost because of these investments and buyouts is unknown, owing {{to a lack of}} records and Bain Capital's penchant for privacy on behalf of itself and its investors. Maximizing the value of acquired companies and the return to Bain's investors, not job creation, was the firm's primary investment goal. Bain Capital's acquisition of Ampad exemplified a deal where it profited handsomely from early payments and management fees, even though the subject company itself later went into bankruptcy. Dade Behring was another case where Bain Capital received an eightfold return on its investment, but the company itself was saddled with debt and laid off over a thousand employees before Bain Capital exited (the company subsequently went into bankruptcy, with more layoffs, before recovering and prospering). Referring to the layoffs that sometimes occurred, Romney said in 2007: [...] "Sometimes the medicine is a little bitter but it is necessary {{to save the life of}} the patient. My job was to try and make the enterprise successful, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> view the best security a family can have is that the business they work for is strong." ...|$|E

500|$|Beyoncé {{met with}} Polachek's bandmate of Chairlift, Patrick Wimberly, who collaborated {{with her sister}} Solange Knowles {{at that time and}} went with her on tour. During the tour, Beyoncé {{expressed}} her admiration of Wimberly, adding that she would [...] "love to get in the studio some time". Wimberly later contacted Beyoncé's management, and Polachek and himself were later invited to a studio in Manhattan to work on Beyoncé self-titled fifth studio album. They stayed in the studio for a week and when the duo was asked to submit the tracks to Beyoncé's team, Polachek added one song with complete production and a missing verse she had written while being on tour in the United Kingdom. At that time, she felt that the song [...] "could be a good album track for Chairlift, but it would be incredibly sexy if Beyoncé did it". Polachek further elaborated about the differences between her version of [...] "No Angel" [...] and Beyoncé's rendition, saying, [...] "Her groove was different—my vocals were jumpier, and hers were more like panting. <b>And</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> version the synths detuned really quickly for a second; she did the same thing but with her voice. It sounds like the whole song melts." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing her own {{reaction}} to the storyline, Smith has commented; [...] "I was psyched. I {{thought it was a}} great idea." [...] She revealed that the writers have not fully divulged Hahn's romantic backstory to her, explaining; [...] "a lot of it is still vague. I mean, there's what the writers think and what I've sort of thought, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind. Maybe I had a crush in high school or in college or something— there was something, but I don't think it's ever— I think it might be her first time." [...] Continuing with this theme, Smith also spoke with Kristin Dos Santos for E! about her character's lack of definitive romantic history, jesting; [...] "I'll look at the script next week and be like [...] "Oh my God, I've been a lesbian for years and I didn't know." [...] She also discussed the meetings with GLAAD she and Ramirez attended, and their impact on her portrayal of the storyline, explaining: [...] "It was actually very helpful because they did talk about their own personal lives, and how, I guess if you're an open person, and life is change, then anything can happen. And it could really rock your world I imagine, if you all of a sudden thought that you might be in love with a woman and maybe you weren't before." ...|$|E
500|$|After a {{game against}} Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road in September 2010, manager Kenny Jackett said Millwall's {{hooligan}} problems are {{to a certain extent}} exaggerated by media sensationalism. [...] "I see it as unjust. We are an easy club to criticise <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> time , the way we have been reported is unfair", he said. Other examples of this include archive footage of their hooligan element's past bad behaviour being shown, when disorder has occurred at other grounds, not involving them. During a game between Millwall and Huddersfield Town, The Observer reported that a Huddersfield Town fan had thrown a coin at a linesman, and that some Millwall fans had intervened, and handed the culprit over to police. The News of the World, however, bore the headline: [...] "Millwall Thugs Deck Linesman With Concrete". This has led to a siege mentality among supporters of the club, which gave rise to the Millwall fans' famous terrace chant, No one likes us, we don't care, being sung in defiant defence of themselves and their team. In April 2013, Millwall met Wigan Athletic in a semi-final of the FA Cup. Millwall lost the game 2–0. Towards the end of the match, violence broke out in part of the stand allocated to Millwall, with individuals fighting amongst themselves and then against police, resulting in 14 arrests, of which two were Wigan supporters. In January 2014, a Millwall fan ripped a linesman's flag after a corner was not given to his side during {{a game against}} Leicester City; Millwall lost 1–3.|$|E
