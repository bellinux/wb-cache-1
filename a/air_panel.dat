25|$|Before {{a diving}} {{operation}} {{it is usually}} necessary {{to set up the}} surface supply equipment. There are a number of components which must be connected in the correct order, with checks at various stages to ensure that there are no leaks and everything functions correctly. Most diving contractors will have comprehensive checklists that are used to ensure that the equipment is connected in the appropriate sequence and all checks are done. Some checks are critical to the safety of the diver. The compressor must be set up so that it gets uncontaminated air to the intake. Filters should be checked in case they need to be changed. Air supply hoses will be connected to the <b>air</b> <b>panel</b> and checked for leaks, umbilicals connected to the panels and helmets, and the communications equipment connected and tested. Before the umbilical is connected to the helmet or full face mask, the umbilical should be blown through to ensure there is no dirt inside, and the non return valve on the bailout block must be given a function test. This is important, as it is there to prevent backflow of air up the umbilical if the line is cut, and if it fails the diver may suffer a helmet squeeze, or a neck dam flood.|$|E

40|$|Aluminium {{honeycomb}} sandwich panels have potential applications as a protective mechanism {{that can be}} used to prevent failure of an important structure subjected to impact loading. Therefore it is important to fully understand the resistance of the sandwich panels subjected to impact loading conditions. The main objective of this work was to study the resistance of sandwich panels with different aluminium honeycomb cores, <b>air</b> sandwich <b>panels</b> (no core between the two face sheets) and monolithic plates of equivalent mass subjected to impact from foam projectiles. The deformation and the elastic spring-back of the {{honeycomb sandwich}} panels and the monolithic plates have been compared and discussed. The resistance of the panels and plates has been quantified by their back-face deflection with respect to the projectile impulse. Five different types of aluminium honeycombs have been used as the core material. The front-face sheet and the back-face sheet of the honeycomb sandwich panels are made of aluminium plate with 1 mm thickness. Cylindrical ALPORAS aluminium foams with a relative density between 9 % and 11 % are employed as the metal foam projectiles. They are fired at several hundred metres per second towards the centre of the panels and plates using a gas gun. The deflection histories of the back-face have been measured using a laser displacement sensor. From the deflection histories, the maximum deflection and the final deflection of the back-face can be distinguished. Deformation modes and failure modes of the individual component have been observed and classified into several categories. Moreover, the deflections of the honeycomb sandwich panels have been compared with deflections from <b>air</b> sandwich <b>panels.</b> It is found that the honeycomb sandwich panels outperform both the <b>air</b> sandwich <b>panels</b> and the monolithic plates within an impulse range of 2. 25 kNsm(- 2) similar to 4. 70 kNsm(- 2). Outside this operational range, the advantages associated with employing the honeycomb sandwich panels as a protective structure upon impact of foam projectiles diminishes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
