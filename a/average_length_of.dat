The relationship is believed to be a coincidence. Light exposure does not appear to affect the menstrual cycle in humans.

5|$|Hypogeomys australis is an extinct rodent {{from central}} and southeastern Madagascar. First {{described}} in 1903, it {{is larger than}} its close relative, the living Hypogeomys antimena, which occurs further west, but otherwise similar. <b>Average</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the femur (upper leg bone) is 72.1mm, compared to 63.8mm in H.antimena. One of the few extinct rodents of Madagascar, it survived to at least around 1536 BP based on radiocarbon dating. Little is known of its ecology, but it may have lived in burrows like its living relative and eaten some arid-adapted plants.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus tao is {{a fossil}} bat in the genus Miniopterus from the Pleistocene of Zhoukoudian in China. It is known {{from a number}} of mandibles (lower jaws), which were {{initially}} identified as the living species Miniopterus schreibersii in 1963 before being recognized as a separate species, M. tao, in 1986. Miniopterus tao is larger than living M. schreibersii and has more closely spaced lower premolars and more robust talonids (back groups of cusps) on the lower molars. The back part of the mandible is relatively low and on it, the coronoid and condyloid processes are about equally high. The <b>average</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the mandible is 12.0mm.|$|E
40|$|With {{health care}} costs rising, {{increased}} {{attention has been paid}} to the human resource practices of hospitals. This chapter examines the effects that staffing levels and wages of registered nurses have on hospitals 2 ̆ 7 <b>average</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> stay. Based on data from 352 California hospitals, we show that both increased staffing levels and wage rates relate to decreased <b>average</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> stay. Furthermore, based on our most complete and accurate models, it appears that wage may be more effective for improving the <b>average</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> stay than would increasing the quantity of RNs. The results of this chapter have a number of implications for human resource practices of RNs and for future research on health care management practices...|$|R

5|$|The {{length of}} time that a typical {{prisoner}} was kept at the Bastille continued to decline, and by Louis XVI's reign the <b>average</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> detention was only two months. Prisoners would still be expected to sign a document on their release, promising {{not to talk about}} the Bastille or their time within it, but by the 1780s this agreement was frequently broken. Prisoners leaving the Bastille could be granted pensions on their release by the Crown, either as a form of compensation or as a way of ensuring future good behaviour – Voltaire was granted 1,200 livres a year, for example, while Latude received an annual pension of 400 livres.|$|E
5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the surface as the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to the <b>average</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} the {{gestation}} period tends to vary greatly, though 110 days is the <b>average</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> time. In {{the final stages of}} pregnancy, dominant females provide their developing offspring with higher androgen levels than lower-ranking mothers do. The higher androgen levels the result of high concentrations of ovarian androstenedione are thought to be responsible for the extreme masculinization of female behavior and morphology. This has the effect of rendering the cubs of dominant females more aggressive and sexually active than those of lower ranking hyenas; high ranking male cubs will attempt to mount females earlier than lower ranking males. The average litter consists of two cubs, with three occasionally being reported. Males take no part in the raising of young. Giving birth is difficult for female hyenas, as the females give birth through their narrow clitoris, and spotted hyena cubs are the largest carnivoran young relative to their mothers' weight. During parturition, the clitoris ruptures in order to facilitate the passage of the young, and may take weeks to heal.|$|E

Grocery prices change much more frequently than magazine prices - frozen orange juice prices change every two weeks, while magazine prices change every three years! Wages in some industries change once per year on average, while others change per quarter and others once every two years. One might hope that a model with homogenous representative price or wage setting would be a good approximation to this more complex world, but most likely some degree of heterogeneity will be required to describe reality accurately." ...|$|R
