30|$|The {{phosphate}} rock dissolution {{can be carried}} out through two main routes, namely partial <b>acidulation</b> and complete <b>acidulation.</b> Both routes could be performed by organic or mineral acids. The partial dissolution of {{phosphate rock}}s is based on the <b>acidulation</b> of one third of the phosphate material by acids to produce soluble monocalcium phosphate which is known in the fertilizer industry as superphosphate. The studied phosphate rock samples are remarked by different contents of their radioactive elements. However, in the complete <b>acidulation,</b> the sulphuric acid is advantageous since it is the only acid which forms gypsum (phosphogypsum) as an insoluble precipitate (CaSO 4.2 H 2 O). Consequently, phosphoric acid can be separated from the slurry directly by filtration. The effect of phosphate rock <b>acidulation</b> with acetic acid (RPAA), citric acid (RPCA), and PR added with composted orange peel (RPOM) compared to triple superphosphate (TSP) for corn plants is studied by (El Gala and Bordeny 2004). They concluded that <b>acidulation</b> of phosphate rock is important for increasing the available phosphorus from phosphate rock and improving crop yield from the P-deficient soil.|$|E

In 1985, application rates were 0, 6. 5, 13. 0, and 19. 5 kg P ha− 1 {{for each of the}} P fertilizers. In 1986, half of the plots received the same rates of P as in 1985 and half of the plots received no additional P.

Newly hatched Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner, 1808) and H.

Non-acidulated olivine also appeared to cause a decline in larval weight. Wollastonite at rates of up to 3. 3 % Si had no significant effect on larval weight whether acidulated or not. A similar effect was observed for H. [*]punctigera. Very few insects survived to emergence on diets containing the higher rates of acidulated olivine. Olivine contains quantities of heavy metals, particularly nickel, cobalt and chromium, which can be toxic to insects.

40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to determine the}} effect of grinding on the <b>acidulation</b> of phosphate rock. Bench-scale work was carried out in a one quart, laboratory ball mill made of stainless steel. The mill was equipped with a heating chamber so that the material could also be dried in the mill;The results from this work indicated that a normal superphosphate product suitable for commercial use could be obtained within an hour after the addition of the first acid. The product had low moisture and low free acid contents, and under suitable conditions, granular form. The mixing action of the balls resulted in good heat transfer during drying with little danger of overheating the product. Consequently, the drying air temperature had little effect on the product except in the rate of production. The reaction was sufficiently rapid in the mill so that no preliminary grinding period was necessary before the drying operation was started. Low <b>acidulation</b> ratios resulted in low conversions as in any normal superphosphate process. Low acid concentrations were more conducive to a rapid reaction between the rock and acid. Below an acid strength of about 55 percent, however, there was no further advantage in dilution;The favorable results of the bench-scale work led to the construction of a pilot plant to determine whether the process could be carried out on a larger scale and on a continuous basis. The process was built around a heated tube mill with a stainless steel lining and a feeding mechanism. Heating was indirect.

The biogenic sulfide production results in metal biocorrosion and reservoir souring, and SRB are typically the main bacterial group involved in these harmful processes in petroleum industries. The biogenic hydrogen sulfide production causes the <b>acidulation</b> and plugging of petroleum reservoirs and biocorrosion of metal surfaces of pipelines and tanks (Nemati et al. 2001 a). Moreover, the sulfide is explosive in high concentrations. SRB may grow in pipes and tanks forming biofilms, leading to the biodegradation of the metal surface (Zuo 2007). Finally, the accumulation of SRB biomass causes reduced oil recovery (Muyzer and Stams 2008; Nemati et al. 2001 b; Postgate 1965). Therefore, in petroleum industries, it is mandatory to control and inhibit SRB growth, which is usually done by biocide dosage (Korenblum et al. 2010; Videla 2002).

Phosphate rock (PR), indigenous to the region, e. g. at Tahoua in Niger and Tilemsi in Mali, is suitable for direct application. Partial <b>acidulation</b> of low-solubility PR improves agronomic effectiveness. Long-term soil-fertility management trials indicate that although application of mineral fertilizers increase yields, they alone cannot sustain productivity. When mineral fertilizers are combined with other technologies, such as the return of crop residues and manure, productive and sustainable production systems are possible. Water-use efficiency increased dramatically with the addition of plant nutrients. Technologies for landsurface management and water harvesting, and appropriate cropping systems with careful varietal selection all contribute to the optimization of soil-water use. Future research should focus on water and nutrient interactions and on understanding why presently available improved technologies are not adopted by farmers even when using a participatory approach...|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} work, it was optimized {{the reaction conditions}} for the chemistry esterification of unsaponifiable matter in soybean oil deodorizer distillate. The process involves (i) alkaline hydrolysis of saponifiable matter; (ii) <b>acidulation</b> of soaps and (iii) acid catalyzed esterification of resulting total fatty acid. To determine the best process conditions to get the higher conversion rates of total fatty acids to ethylic esters, preserving the tocopherols, it was used, to analyze the results, the response surface methodology in a 2 nd order factorial planning. In the step (i) saponification of soybean oil deodorizer distillate saponifiable matter using NaOH:total fatty acids molar ratio = 2 : 1, temperature = 80 ° 0 and reaction time of 40 min. In the step (ii) the resulting soaps were rapidly and stoichiometricatiy converted in free fatty acids with sulfuric acid (23 %), using an acid molar excess of 50 %, at 80 ° 0, for 40 min and under atmospheric pressure. In the step (iii) the optima conditions for the esterification reaction of soybean oil deodorizer distillate were: ethanol:total fatty acids molar ratio from 8. 4 to 11. 2 : 1, H 2 SO 4 concentration from 0. 9 to 1. 5 % and reaction time from 1. 3 to 2. 8 h, with ethyl esters conversion rates up to 98 %. The mathematical model obtained is predictive and statistically significant (p< 0. 05). The total tocopherol losses during the process were less than 10. 5 %...|$|E
40|$|Tropical upland regions {{have both}} the world's highest {{population}} growth rates and {{a preponderance of}} soils less suitable for agriculture. Nitrogen deficiency is almost universal, while acid infertility and the related problem of P deficiency affect more than 40 f tropical soils. Nutrient depletion, as opposed to inherent infertility, affects large areas due to continuous cropping with few inputs. Nitrogen management requires a continual supply of N {{that can be achieved}} through fertilization, green manuring, legume rotations or leguminous tree-shrub fallows. Rotations and fallows usually require foregoing one or more staple crop harvests, which is not feasible for smallholder farmers in land-limited areas. In such areas there are few options for farmers except mineral N fertilizers. Phosphorus availability can be built up in soils, but to achieve this, external inputs of inorganic P are essential. Use of P-efficient crops, or mobilisation of soil organic P by various means, are temporary solutions since they involve only offtake with no addition. Phosphorus additions may be either as soluble processed fertilizers or indigenous phosphate rocks (PRs). Most tropical PR deposits are unreactive and require processing before use. Some lower-cost options include partial <b>acidulation,</b> blending with soluble P sources or microbial solubilization. The relevance of microbial solubilization in particular requires testing at larger scale. There are no magic solutions to soil nutrient deficiencies or toxicities; to maintain productivity mineral fertilizers are necessary. They should be used in judicious amounts and coupled with improved organic matter management...|$|E
40|$|A sizable {{amount of}} {{technical}} {{information has been}} accumulated {{on the effects of}} agricultural applications of the natural mineral product called Sul-Fe. This technical information supports the field observations of farmers, landscapers and gardeners who have used the product. Sul-Fe is often evaluated in terms of its sulphur content alone. When compared to elemental sulphur (100 % sulphur), the 18 to 21 % sulphur content of Sul-Fe seems relatively low. However, as the following technical data indicates, when judged on actual effects, Sul-Fe's complex mixture of minerals has several advantages over elemental sulphur. When judged on the basis of soil <b>acidulation,</b> Sul-Fe has more immediate effects than elemental sulphur. The rapid acidifying effect is due to Sul-Fe's content of crystalline sulphuric acid. Sul-Fe also has long-term effects on soil pH due to its content of sulphur and sulfides and the time required to oxidize these materials. Elemental sulphur contains sulphur in only one chemical form which must be microbially oxidized before it becomes reactive in the soil solution, a reaction that takes quite some time in some soils. Sul-Fe is thus better than elemental sulphur in terms of immediate effects and comparable in terms of long term effects. Applied blends of Sul-Fe supplemented with elemental sulphur may provide for a maximization of both short and long term effects. An additional benefit derived from the use of Sul-Fe is the addition to the soil of a variety of trace nutrients including iron, calcium, zinc, copper, manganese, magnesium, and molybdenum...|$|E
40|$|In {{the process}} of {{phosphate}} rock <b>acidulation,</b> several impure P compounds may be formed along with the desirable Ca and NH 4 phosphates. Such compounds normally reduce the content of water-soluble P and thus the agronomic effectiveness of commercial fertilizers. In order to study this problem, a greenhouse experiment consisting of three consecutive corn crops was conducted in samples of a Red-Yellow Latosol (Typical Hapludox) in a completely randomized design (6 x 2 x 2), with four replicates. Six commercial fertilizers were added to 2 kg of soil {{at a rate of}} 70 mg kg- 1 P, based on the content of soluble P in neutral ammonium citrate plus water (NAC + H 2 O) of the fertilizers. Fertilizer application occurred either in the original form or leached to remove the water-soluble fraction, either by mixing the fertilizer with the whole soil in the pots or with only 1 % of its volume. The corn plants were harvested 40 days after emergence to determine the shoot dry matter and accumulated P. For the first crop and localized application, the elimination of water-soluble P from the original fertilizers resulted in less bioavailable P for the plants. For the second and third crops, the effects of P source, leaching and application methods were not as evident as for the first, suggesting that the tested P sources may have similar efficiencies when considering successive cropping. The conclusion was drawn that the water-insoluble but NAC-soluble fractions of commercial P fertilizers are not necessarily inert because they can provide P in the long run...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} starter culture and {{chemical}} <b>acidulation</b> {{on the growth}} and enterotoxigenesis of Staphylococcus aureus strain S- 6 in Italian dry salami under commercial manufacturing conditions was studied. The experimental design included two levels of S. aureus (104 and 105 /g), three levels of starter culture (0, 105, and 106 /g), three levels of initial pH (pH 0) (6. 1, 5. 5, and 4. 8), two manufacturing plants, and three replications. S. aureus growth in the salami was affected significantly (P < 0. 005) by pH 0, initial levels of S. aureus (staph 0) and lactic acid bacteria (LAB 0), day of fermentation, and by the interactions of pH 0 × day, pH 0 × LAB 0, LAB 0 × staph 0, pH 0 × staph 0, and pH 0 × location of fermentation. In general, the lower the pH 0 and the higher the LAB 0, the greater the inhibition of S. aureus. The LAB levels during the fermentation were affected significantly (P < 0. 005) by pH 0, LAB 0, day of fermentation, location, LAB 0 × pH 0, and LAB 0 × day. Derived regression equations related level of S. aureus and LAB at any day of fermentation {{to a number of}} microbiological and chemical variables. Close similarity of observed and predicted levels of S. aureus and LAB growth demonstrated the usefulness of the experimental approach in evaluating the safety of a process. No detectable enterotoxin or thermonuclease was found at any stage of processing even when S. aureus reached levels of 107 /g of salami...|$|E
40|$|With {{a growing}} {{population}} but scarce primary phosphorus sources, recycling of the vital element {{has become an}} important research area throughout the last decades. Several streams in society are potential resources for recirculation but municipal sewage {{is considered one of}} the most available materials. With current technologies in wastewater treatment, over 95 % of the influent phosphorus is captured in the sludge along with a variety of other nutrients. However, due to increasing fractions of pharmaceutical residues and heavy metals also following the sludge, direct use as fertiliser is being phased out in most European countries in favour of extraction methods. Extraction of nutrients from the sludge is problematic mainly because of dewaterability difficulties. Thus, pretreatment of the material is required to access the desired components at a reasonable cost and energy consumption. Hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) is a technology showing high potential for treatment of wet carbonaceous material without necessity of prior drying. The resulting product is hygenised, essentially free from pharmaceuticals and easily dewatered. In this Master’s thesis principal conditions for release of phosphorus from HTC converted digested sludge under acid leaching have been experimentally investigated. Dependence of time, temperature, dry solids (DS) content of HTC sludge and pH have been studied. Also, differences arising from acid type have been considered by comparing <b>acidulation</b> with sulphuric acid and hydrochloric acid. A short investigation of the recovery of the dissolved phosphorus from leachate by precipitation was also performed where calcium ions were added to both sulphuric and hydrochloric acid leachates. Extraction of phosphorus from HTC converted sludge has shown to be easier than from pure metal phosphates under comparable leaching conditions and pH values. Also, the dissolved phosphorus concentrations obtained in the presence of HTC converted sludge was higher than for theoretical equilibrium concentrations where all phosphorus is in the form of iron(III) or aluminium(III) phosphate. A maximum leachate phosphorus concentration was around 2500 mg/L, recorded in leaching experiments performed at a dry HTC product concentration of 10 % (w/w) in an extraction solution of water acidified with sulphuric acid. Leaching procedures performed at pH values between 2 and 1 with 1 and 5 % DS HTC product resulted in dissolution of 90 % of ingoing phosphorus at an acid charge of 0. 5 kg H 2 SO 4 /kg DS HTC product. At this chemical charge, release of phosphorus from converted sludge is fast. Similar amounts of dissolved phosphorus were recorded after 15 min as after 16 h retention time. Possibly, time dependence becomes relevant at lower charges. The dissolution of phosphorus is negatively affected by temperature increases at moderate acid loads, and by possibly by hydrochloric acid at pH values below 2. Addition of calcium gave a dissolved phosphorus reduction of 99. 9 % in both the sulphuric acid and hydrochloric acid leachates. Gypsum, CaSO 4, also precipitates from the sulphuric acid leachate resulting in 67 % more dry mass. Due to high release of metals during <b>acidulation,</b> the precipitate was also contaminated with large fractions of metals in addition to calcium. In summary, this investigation has demonstrated that up to 90 % of the phosphorus content of the HTC converted sludge can be released by acid leaching, and almost 100 % of the phosphorus can be recovered from the leachate by precipitation with calcium ions...|$|E
