Some critics of such games call them [...] "pay-to-win" [...] or [...] "p2w" [...] games. A common suggestion for avoiding pay-to-win is that payments should only be used to broaden the experience without affecting gameplay. For example, games such as Maplestory, Dota 2, and League of Legends only allow the purchase of cosmetic items, meaning that a [...] "free-to-play player" [...] will be on the same level as a player who has spent money on the game. Some suggest finding a balance between a game that encourages players to pay for extra content that enhances the game without making the free version feel limited by comparison. This theory is that players who do not pay for items would still increase awareness of it through word of mouth marketing, which ultimately benefits the game indirectly. In response to concerns about players using payments to gain an advantage in game, titles such as World of Tanks have explicitly committed to not giving paying players any advantages over their non-paying peers, while allowing the users buying the [...] "gold" [...] or [...] "premium" [...] ammo and expendables without paying the real money. However, features helping to grind easier, such as purchasing a 100% training level or experience points, remain available for the paying customers only.|$|E

60|$|But {{how is this}} to be done? The road to {{it is a very}} plain one. We shall gain all we want if we {{make the}} South really prosperous; for with {{prosperity}} will come roads, schools, churches, printing presses, industry, thrift, intelligence, and security of life and property. Hitherto the prosperity of the South has been factitious; it has been a prosperity of the Middle Ages, keeping the many poor that a few might show their wealth in the barbarism of showy equipages and numerous servants, and spend in foreign cities the wealth that should have built up civilization and made way for refinement at home. There were no public libraries, no colleges worthy of the name; there was no art, no science,--still worse, no literature but Simms's: there was no desire for them. We do not say it in reproach; we are simply stating a fact, and are quite aware that the North is far behind Europe in these things. But we are not behind her in the value we set upon them; are even before her in the price we <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> them, and are in the way to get them. The South was not in that way; could not get into it, indeed, so long as the labor that made wealth was cut off from any interest in its expenditure, nor had any goal for such hopes as soared away from the dreary level of its lifelong drudgery but in the grave and the world beyond it. We are not blind to what may be said on the other side, nor to that fatal picturesqueness, so attractive to sentimental minds and so melancholy to thoughtful ones, which threw a charm over certain exceptional modes of Southern life among the older families in Virginia and South Carolina. But there are higher and manlier kinds of beauty,--barer and sterner, some would call them,--with less softly rounded edges, certainly, than the Wolf's Crag picturesqueness, which carries the mind with pensive indolence toward the past, instead of stirring it with a sense of present life, or bracing it with the hope of future opportunity, and which at once veils and betrays the decay of ancient civilizations. Unless life is arranged for the mere benefit of the novelist, what right had these bits of last-century Europe here? Even the virtues of the South were some of them anachronisms; and even those that were not existed side by side with an obtuseness of moral sense that could make a hero of Semmes, and a barbarism that could starve prisoners by the thousand.|$|E
