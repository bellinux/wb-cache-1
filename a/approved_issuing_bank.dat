50|$|With {{independence}} from Britain in 1960, Article 118 of the Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus, which came into {{force on the}} island on 1 April 1960, gave the President and Vice-President of Cyprus the right {{to establish a new}} central bank, called in the Constitution the 'Issuing Bank' and appoint its Governor. Article 119 sets out the responsibilities of the Governor and the <b>Issuing</b> <b>Bank,</b> Article 120 states that the Governor of the <b>Issuing</b> <b>Bank</b> shall abide by future relevant laws enacted by the Republic of Cyprus, and Article 121 gives the Government of the Republic of Cyprus the right to convert the <b>Issuing</b> <b>Bank</b> into a Central Bank if it wishes. In effect the <b>Issuing</b> <b>Bank</b> was a continuation of the former colonial Currency Board {{within the framework of the}} Constitution of the new Republic, but the Constitution gave the right to the Republic to convert it into a Central Bank if it chose to do so. A decision to do this was taken in 1963, and the <b>Issuing</b> <b>Bank</b> was replaced that year by the Central Bank of Cyprus.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we present}} an on-line {{electronic}} payment system for low-value transaction. We use the concept of signcryption for each communication between any pair of entities and offers token updation instantly as an add-on feature to existing on-line e-cash systems where token is the payment instrument (containing electronic cash) which acts as an electronic wallet. In our system, the token is issued and authenticated by <b>Issuing</b> <b>Bank</b> (token issuer). Merchant veriﬁes the user and sends authenticated transaction details to <b>Issuing</b> <b>Bank.</b> Later <b>Issuing</b> <b>Bank</b> veriﬁes approval of both customer and merchant. The merchant is also veriﬁed by its ﬁnancial institution. Unlike the existing e-payment system question of double spending of e-cash arises because each transaction are made uniquely identiﬁable and updation is instantly done by <b>Issuing</b> <b>bank.</b> Hence no separate protocols are needed to be developed for handling disputes. The proposed scheme provide anonymity, authenticity, conﬁdentiality and fairness...|$|R

50|$|The tactics {{remain the}} same as {{consumers}} are tricked into joining membership into a savings club. The suit asserts that the other Defendants are vital to the improper billing scheme. First, Vertrue transmits a consumer’s credit card data to the related credit card network, which the complaint alleges was MasterCard. MasterCard verifies the consumer’s identity and, the lawsuit states, analyzes the transaction {{to determine whether it}} is fraudulent. MasterCard transmits the relevant data to the cardholder’s <b>issuing</b> <b>bank</b> which, if it authorizes the charge, sends a verification message to MasterCard, which then informs the <b>issuing</b> <b>bank</b> that the charge has been authorized, according to the suit. The suit claims that the <b>issuing</b> <b>bank</b> then informs Vertrue of the authorization, at which point the purchase is completed and the <b>issuing</b> <b>bank</b> and MasterCard subsequently “clear” and “settle” all of Vertrue’s charges for that day, at which point the illicitly obtained funds are sent to Vertrue. The suit contends that all the Defendants are well aware of the illegal scheme, but they nonetheless participate in order to obtain substantial transaction fees.|$|R

40|$|Process of {{international}} trade is complicated and risky. Risks will be more considerable when times come to deal with receiving/sending payments from/to unknown business partners in remote geographic areas. Employing documentary letters of credit (LC) {{is one of the}} ways to reduce payment risk in international business especially when partner’s financial standing is unknown to each other. By using the LC as method of payment, parties will shift payment obligation from buyer as a natural person to the guarantee of bank as a legal person. The process of using LC is complicated and involves different players and relations between them. Amongst all relations in process of LC transaction, relation between <b>issuing</b> <b>bank</b> and beneficiary is the most complicated and least clear from legal stand point. This article tries to shed light on vague aspects of relations between <b>issuing</b> <b>bank</b> and beneficiary by studying obligations of the <b>issuing</b> <b>bank</b> towards beneficiary under the law of documentary letters of credit while comparing provisions of UCP with English Common Law on subject matter. Main objective of paper is providing {{answer to the question of}} what is the role of <b>issuing</b> <b>bank</b> in the process of LC transaction and which liabilities does it have towards beneficiary? Article consists of five main parts. Part one will provide an introduction to function and relation among different parties in process of an international LC transaction. Further, it endeavors to tap on principle of autonomy and strict compliance as governing principles of documentary letters of credit. Part two and three will take a comprehensive look at legal basis of relations between <b>issuing</b> <b>bank</b> and beneficiary, as well as bank’s obligations under documentary credit law. Part four will discuss liabilities of <b>issuing</b> <b>banks</b> towards beneficiary and finally part five will touch upon situation in which bank will right to recourse against beneficiary...|$|R
