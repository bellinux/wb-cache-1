5|$|Adams also {{rebuilt the}} Navy, adding six fast, {{powerful}} frigates, {{most notably the}} USS Constitution. To pay for the military buildup, Congress imposed new taxes on property: the Direct Tax of 1798. It was the first (and last) such federal tax. Taxpayers were angered, especially in southeast Pennsylvania, where the bloodless Fries's Rebellion broke out among rural German-speaking farmers who protested {{what they saw as}} <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> republican liberties and to their churches.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the militias}} that were then {{competing}} for power interpreted the UN troops' presence as <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> hegemony. Consequently, several gun battles {{took place in}} Mogadishu between local gunmen and peacekeepers. Among these was the Battle of Mogadishu of 1993, a US apprehension of two high-ranking lieutenants of faction leader Aidid. The UN soldiers eventually withdrew altogether from the country on 3 March 1995, having incurred more significant casualties.|$|E
5|$|Steamboat {{companies}} rightly saw nationwide railroads as <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> business. On May 6, 1856, {{just weeks}} after the bridge was completed, a steamboat captain deliberately crashed the Effie Afton into the bridge. The owner of the Effie Afton, John Hurd, {{filed a lawsuit against}} the Rock Island Railroad Company. Abraham Lincoln was the lead defense lawyer for the railroad company. The decision of the United States Supreme Court upheld the right to bridge navigable streams, therefore the bridge was allowed to remain.|$|E
50|$|When the Portuguese colonised part of Goa in {{the sixteenth}} century, they based their {{operations}} in the central district of Tiswadi, notably in the international emporium 'City of Goa', now Old Goa. <b>As</b> <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> maritime supremacy increased, they built forts on various hillocks, especially along the coast.

5|$|After the lynchings {{of their}} {{prominent}} competitors, the WSGA's {{control over the}} range was undisputed, until a group of smaller ranchers led by a local cowboy named Nate Champion formed the Northern Wyoming Farmers and Stock Growers' Association (NWFSGA) {{to compete with the}} WSGA. Upon hearing this, the WSGA immediately viewed Champion's association as <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> hold on the stock interests. The WSGA then blacklisted members of the NWFSGA from the round-ups in order to stop their operations. However, the latter refused the orders to disband and instead publicly announced their plans to hold their own round-up in the spring of 1892.|$|E
5|$|Although the Junta of Seville was defeated, {{a new one}} {{was created}} afterwards, the Regency Council. The Primera Junta did not swear loyalty to it, but the Royal Audiencia did so in {{defiance}} of the local authority. The Junta summoned them, along with former viceroy Cisneros, and exiled them to Spain with the pretext that there was <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> lives. The Junta appointed new members for the Audiencia loyal to the revolution. Moreno wrote in the Gazeta that the Audiencia attacked the good faith of the government, and that the Junta left their usual moderation {{for the safety of the}} people.|$|E
5|$|Mallards {{are also}} preyed upon by other {{waterside}} apex predators, {{such as the}} grey heron, European herring gull, the wels catfish, and the northern pike. Crows (Corvus) are also known to kill ducklings and adults on occasion. Also, mallards may be attacked by larger anseriformes such as swans (Cygnus) and geese during the breeding season, and are frequently driven off by these birds over territorial disputes. Mute swans (C. olor) {{have been known to}} attack or even kill mallards if they feel that the ducks pose <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> offspring.|$|E

Fifty-two participants wrote a narrative describing {{a situation where}} they received <b>a</b> major <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> self-esteem and <b>a</b> situation where they received <b>a</b> minor <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> self-esteem. They then answered questions regarding the experience of ego-shock following the event described in each narrative. Ego-shock was reported following major self-esteem <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> greater degree than following minor self-esteem threats. Additional analyses revealed that ego-shock is an immediate and automatic process. The long-term effects of major self-esteem <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> the individual are discussed...|$|R

5|$|The {{efforts of}} the two monarchs could not yield the desired result because the French, upon {{learning}} of their request, responded promptly to what they perceived as <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> interests in the Pacific. On 27 March 1889, the French warship Dives landed on Rurutu carrying the colonial governor of French Oceania, Étienne Lacascade. British and French sources provide differing accounts of Teuruarii's response to Lacascade's arrival. According to the British, the King was initially reluctant {{to agree to a}} French protectorate but ultimately decided to give his acquiescence. According to the French, however, King Teuruarii and his chiefs had personally petitioned Governor Lacascade to take over the islands, largely contrary to the desire {{of the majority of the}} islanders.|$|E
5|$|Though the Queen Regent, Mary of Guise, made no {{move against}} Knox, his {{activities}} caused concern among the church authorities. The bishops of Scotland viewed him as <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> authority and summoned him to appear in Edinburgh on 15 May 1556. He was accompanied to the trial by so many influential persons that the bishops decided to call the hearing off. Knox was now free to preach openly in Edinburgh. William Keith, the Earl Marischal, was impressed and urged Knox to write to the Queen Regent. Knox's unusually respectful letter urged her to support the Reformation and overthrow the church hierarchy. Queen Mary took the letter as a joke and ignored it.|$|E
5|$|A {{storm in}} the {{southern}} Atlantic caused the loss of several ships, and the six remaining ships eventually rendezvoused in the Mozambique Channel before proceeding to Calicut in India. Cabral was originally successful in negotiating trading rights, but Arab merchants saw Portugal's venture as <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> monopoly and stirred up an attack by both Muslims and Hindus on the Portuguese entrepôt. The Portuguese sustained many casualties and their facilities were destroyed. Cabral took vengeance by looting and burning the Arab fleet and then bombarded the city in retaliation for its ruler having failed to explain the unexpected attack. From Calicut the expedition sailed to the Kingdom of Cochin, another Indian city-state, where Cabral befriended its ruler and loaded his ships with coveted spices before returning to Europe. Despite the loss of human lives and ships, Cabral's voyage was deemed a success upon his return to Portugal. The extraordinary profits resulting {{from the sale of}} the spices bolstered the Portuguese Crown's finances and helped lay the foundation of a Portuguese Empire that would stretch from the Americas to the Far East.|$|E

5|$|According to medieval scholar Richard Zeikowitz, the Green Knight {{represents}} {{a threat to}} homosocial friendship in his medieval world. Zeikowitz argues that the narrator of the poem seems entranced by the Knight's beauty, homoeroticising him in poetic form. The Green Knight's attractiveness challenges the homosocial rules of King Arthur's court and poses <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> way of life. Zeikowitz also states that Gawain seems to find Bertilak as attractive as the narrator finds the Green Knight. Bertilak, however, follows the homosocial code and develops a friendship with Gawain. Gawain's embracing and kissing Bertilak in several scenes thus represents not a homosexual but a homosocial expression. Men of the time often embraced and kissed and this was acceptable under the chivalric code. Nonetheless, the Green Knight blurs the lines between homosociality and homosexuality, representing the difficulty medieval writers sometimes had in separating the two.|$|E
5|$|As the GTA and PVE launch further {{attacks on}} the Shivans, it is quickly {{discovered}} that what is left is unorganised, leading the alliance to co-ordinate a full invasion of their main strongholds, as other systems they occupied slowly return under Terran and Vasudan control. But as the last remaining threat from the Shivans is crushed, officers in the highest echelons of the GTI effect an attempt to cover-up plans for a coup against the GTA by going after the Krios, the only ship aware of the plot and thus <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> plans. However, the pilots sent out by the Krios during the final fight with the Shivans, return early, arriving in time to discover the treason and alert GTA command. Realising {{that much of the}} GTI has gone rogue and fighting against the alliance, the remnants of the GTI loyal to the GTA cause is merged with its battle-groups and begins conducting operations to bring down the ringleaders, including the capture of the Repulse.|$|E
5|$|Bormann's {{power and}} {{effective}} reach broadened considerably during the war. By early 1943, the war produced a labour crisis for the regime. Hitler created a three-man committee {{with representatives of}} the State, the army, and the Party in an attempt to centralise control of the war economy. The committee members were Hans Lammers (head of the Reich Chancellery), Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, chief of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Armed Forces High Command; OKW), and Bormann, who controlled the Party. The committee was intended to independently propose measures regardless of the wishes of various ministries, with Hitler reserving most final decisions to himself. The committee, soon known as the Dreierausschuß (Committee of Three), met eleven times between January and August 1943. However, they ran up against resistance from Hitler's cabinet ministers, who headed deeply entrenched spheres of influence and were excluded from the committee. Seeing it as <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> power, Goebbels, Göring, and Speer worked together to bring it down. The result was that nothing changed, and the Committee of Three declined into irrelevance.|$|E

5|$|In the 1850s, Germans made up Davenport's largest {{settlement}} group. By 1858, {{more than}} one-fifth of Davenport's nearly 11,000 residence were Germans. The growing city had {{a need for}} a railroad bridge to cross into Illinois. Before a bridge was built, privately owned ferryboats transported passengers, wagons, and cargo across the Mississippi River. In 1856, the first railroad bridge built across the Mississippi River connecting Davenport and Rock Island, IL. It was built by the Rock Island Railroad. Steamboaters saw nationwide railroads as <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> business. On May 6, 1856, just weeks after it was completed, a steamboater crashed the Effie Afton steamboat into the bridge.

5|$|Joseph's {{reforms were}} deeply unpopular within the Austrian Netherlands. The Enlightenment had made few inroads into the territory, {{and it was}} widely distrusted as a foreign {{phenomenon}} which was not compatible with traditional local values. The majority of the population, especially influenced by the Church, believed the reforms to be <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> own cultures and traditions which would leave them worse off. Even in pro-Enlightenment circles, the reforms caused discontent which were seen as not sufficiently radical and not far reaching enough. Popular opposition was centered on the provincial states, in particular Hainaut, Brabant and Flanders, {{as well as their}} law courts. There was a wave of critical pamphleting. In some towns, riots broke out and the militia had to be called to suppress them. The Estate of Brabant called a lawyer, Hendrik Van der Noot, to defend their position publicly. Van der Noot publicly accused the reforms of violating the precedents established by the Joyous Entry of 1356 which was widely regarded as a traditional bill of rights for the region.|$|E

5|$|Leaders of El Grito de Lares {{who were}} in exile in New York City joined the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee, founded on December 8, 1895 to {{continue}} the quest for independence. In 1897, {{with the aid of}} Antonio Mattei Lluberas and Fidel Velez, the local leaders of the independence movement of the town of Yauco, they organized another uprising, which became known as the Intentona de Yauco. On March 26, 1897, there was a second and last major attempt to overthrow the Spanish government. The local conservative political factions, which believed that such an attempt would be <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> struggle for autonomy, opposed such an action. Rumors of the planned event spread to the local Spanish authorities, who acted swiftly {{and put an end to}} what would be the last major uprising in the island to Spanish colonial rule.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, King James became {{increasingly}} unpopular in England. He alienated otherwise supportive Tories with {{his attempts to}} relax the Penal Laws, and he issued the Declaration of Indulgence in 1687, which established some freedom of religion, a move opposed by the Anglican church hierarchy. He increased {{the power of the}} regular army, an action seen by many Parliamentarians as <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> authority, and placed Catholics in important military positions. James also attempted to place sympathizers in Parliament who he hoped would repeal the Test Act, which required a strict Anglican religious test for many civil offices. Some Whigs and Tories set aside their political differences when his son and potential successor James was born in June 1688, and they conspired to replace him with his Protestant son-in-law William, Prince of Orange. The Dutch prince had tried fruitlessly to get James to reconsider his policies; he agreed to an invasion, and the nearly bloodless revolution that followed in November and December 1688 established William and his wife Mary as co-rulers.|$|E
5|$|Cornelio Saavedra {{was aware}} that the Junta would be {{resisted}} by factions still loyal to the old authorities. It was resisted locally by the Cabildo and the Royal Audiencia; the nearby plazas of Montevideo and Paraguay did not recognize it; and Santiago de Liniers organized a counter-revolution at Córdoba. During this early period, the Junta worked united against the royalist threats. Mariano Moreno, the secretary of war, drafted the decrees and regulations to deal with royalists. First, a decree ordered punishment for anyone attempting to generate disputes, and for those concealing conspiracies against the Junta or other people. The Royal Audiencia swore loyalty to the Regency Council, in defiance to the Junta, so they were summoned, along with former viceroy Cisneros, and exiled to Spain with the pretext that there was <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> lives. The Junta appointed new members for the Audiencia loyal to the revolution. Moreno organized as well the Paraguay campaign and the First Upper Peru campaign, to the plazas that resisted the Junta. The second one, headed by Francisco Ortiz de Ocampo, would move to Córdoba and attack the counter-revolution; before marching to Upper Peru. Ocampo's initial orders were to capture the counter-revolutionary leaders {{and send them to}} Buenos Aires, so that they could be judged. When the counter-revolution became stronger Moreno called the Junta and proposed that the enemy leaders should be shot {{as soon as they were}} captured instead of brought to trial. The new orders were carried out by Juan José Castelli. Cornelio Saavedra supported all these measures.|$|E
