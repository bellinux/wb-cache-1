40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that sympatric bumblebee species form mimicry rings to profit from learnt avoidance behaviour by predators. This hypothesis can be tested by comparing the predation rates of local bumblebees with those of imported nonnative bumblebees, whose coat colour {{is different from that}} of local bees, so that their coloration is unfamiliar to local predators. To test whether populations of non-native bumblebees suffer higher worker loss rates during foraging, we conducted transplant experiments in the UK, Germany and Sardinia. The loss rates of foraging workers of four Bombus terrestris populations (Bombus terrestris canariensis, Bombus terrestris terrestris, Bombus terrestris sassaricus and Bombus terrestris dalmatinus) were compared, evaluating data from 989 foragers, whose flight times were monitored precisely (over 8258 h of foraging). While all of these workers display a bright UV-reflecting abdominal tip, the colours in other body parts differ strongly to the eyes of avian predators. The hypothesis that foragers from the non-native bumblebee populations, which differ in coloration from the local native population, would suffer higher predation risk was not upheld. In contrast, in one location (Sardinia) the native population had the highest loss rate. The consistent population rank order we found in terms of forager losses indicates that such losses are more prominently affected by factors other than the familiarity of local predators with <b>aposematic</b> <b>colour</b> patterns...|$|E
40|$|Heliconius {{butterflies}} {{are found}} across the neo-tropics, with bright <b>aposematic</b> <b>colour</b> patterns. These Müllerian mimics show striking colour pattern convergence across species, while paradoxically showing striking diversity within species. Thus Heliconius wing patterns {{have become an}} excellent system for understanding the repeatability of evolution. This work has {{identified a number of}} genes that appear to be involved in colour pattern control across species, such as optix and cortex, which respectively control red and yellow pattern elements. However, this work has only looked at the genetic basis of colour pattern in a small number of species, and primarily focusses on just two; H. melpomene and H. erato. I first use a population genomics approach to try to identify whether optix controls the hindwing rays phenotype in two poorly studied species; H. demeter and H. aoede. I identify both divergence associated with colour pattern at this optix, as well as another putative colour pattern control locus in H. aoede, the ommochrome pathway gene cardinal. Further, I use Quantitative trait loci analysis to explore the genetics of colour pattern in H. melpomene, confirming WntA as the gene controlling the ‘broken band’ phenotype and I identify a locus associated with red-orange pigmentation, while also exploring the role of minor effect loci in quantitative colour pattern variation. Finally, I use the natural diversity at two hybrid zones, in conjunction with phylogenetic discordance at mimicry loci, to identify putative regulatory enhancers associated with colour pattern shifts, investigate introgression across species at this fine genetic scale, and the possible role of colour pattern introgression in Heliconius speciation. This work reveals both interesting cases of convergent genetic evolution, independent genetic evolution and introgression, showing that a variety of evolutionary processes have shaped Heliconius mimicry across species...|$|E
40|$|International {{audience}} 1. Aposematic animals advertise their {{defences to}} predators via warning signals that often are bright colours combined with black patterns. Predation {{is assumed to}} select for large pattern elements and conspicuousness of warning signals because this enhances avoidance learning of predators. However, conspicuousness of the colour pattern can vary among individuals of aposematic species, suggesting that warning signal expression may be constrained by opposing selection pressures. If effective warning signals are costly to produce, variation in signal expression may be maintained via physiological trade-offs. To understand the costs of signalling that might underlay both physiological and ecological trade-offs, {{it is crucial to}} identify the pigments involved in aposematic traits, how they or their precursors are acquired and how their production and ⁄ or deposition interact with other physiological processes. 2. We characterized the pigments responsible for the genetically and phenotypically variable orange-black warning signal of the hairy larvae of an Arctiid moth, Parasemia plantaginis. We tested orange and black coloured hairs for the presence of six candidate pigment types using high-performance liquid chromatography, spectral and solubility analyses. 3. After excluding the presence of carotenoids, ommochromes, pterins and pheomelanins in orange hairs, our results suggest that tiger moth larvae produce their orange warning signal by depositing both diet-derived flavonoids and trace levels of synthesized eumelanin in their hairs. The nearby black hairs are coloured by eumelanin. 4. In light of previous studies, we conclude that although a large orange patch increases the 1 larvae's antipredator efficacy, variation in the size of orange patches within a population can be driven by scarcity of flavonoids in diet. However, traces of eumelanin found in the orange hairs of the larvae may also {{play a significant role in}} the maintenance of the signal pattern on poor quality diets. 5. The goal of the future studies will be to test the condition dependence of pigment deposition in <b>aposematic</b> <b>colour</b> patterns by directly manipulating relevant nutritional parameters such as dietary flavonoid or nitrogen content (i. e. amino acid content) ...|$|E

40|$|In nature, {{many animals}} use body {{coloration}} {{to communicate with}} each other. For example, colorations can be used as signals between individuals of the same species, but also to recognise individuals of other species, and if they may comprise a threat or not. Many animals use protective coloration to avoid predation. The two most common strategies of protective coloration are camouflage and aposematism. Camouflaged animals have coloration that minimises detection, usually by matching colours or structures in the background. Aposematic animals, on the other hand, signal to predators that they are defended. The defence can be physical structures, such as spikes and hairs, or chemical compounds that make the animal distasteful or even deadly toxic. In order for the warning signal to be effective, the predator has to recognise it as such. Studies have shown that birds for example, that are important visual predators on insects, learn to recognise and avoid unpalatable prey faster if they contrast the background or have large internal contrasts. Typical examples of aposematic species have conspicuous colours like yellow, orange or red, often in combination with black. My thesis focuses on the appearance and function of <b>aposematic</b> <b>colour</b> patterns. Even though researchers have studied aposematism for over a century, there is still a lot we do not know about the phenomenon. For example, as it is crucial that the predators recognise a warning signal, aposematic colorations should assumingly evolve homogeneously and be selected for maximal conspicuousness. Instead, there is an extensive variation of colours and patterns among warning colorations, and {{it is not uncommon to}} find typical cryptic colours, such as green and brown in <b>aposematic</b> <b>colour</b> patterns. One hypothesis to this variation is that an aposematic coloration does not have to be maximally signalling in order to be effective, instead it is sufficient to have distinct features that can be easily distinguished from edible prey. To be maximally conspicuous is one way to achieve this, but not the only way. Another hypothesis is that aposematic prey that do not exhibit maximal conspicuousness can exploit both camouflage and aposematism in a distance-dependent fashion, by being signalling when seen close up but camouflaged at a distance. Many prey animals also make use of both strategies by shifting colour at different ecological conditions such as seasonal variations, fluctuations in food resources or between life stages. Yet another explanation for the variation may be that prey animals are usually exposed to several predator species that vary in visual perception and tolerance towards various toxins. The aim with this thesis is, by studying their functions, to understand why aposematic warning signals vary in appearance, specifically in the level of conspicuousness, and if warning coloration can be combined with camouflage. In paper I, I investigated if the colour pattern of the aposematic larva of the Apollo butterfly (Parnassius apollo) can switch function with viewing distance, and be signalling at close range but camouflaged at a distance, by comparing detection time between different colour variants and distances. The results show that the natural coloration has a dual distance-dependent function. Moreover, the study shows that an aposematic coloration does not have to be selected for maximal conspicuousness. A prey animal can optimise its coloration primarily by avoiding detection, but also by investing in a secondary defence, which presence can be signalled if detected. In paper II, I studied how easily detected the coloration of the firebug (Pyrrhocoris apterus), a typical aposematic species, is at different distances against different natural backgrounds, by comparing detection time between different colour variants. Here, I found no distance-dependent switch in function. Instead, the results show that the coloration of the firebug is selected for maximal conspicuousness. One explanation for this is that the firebug is more mobile than the butterfly larva in study I, and movement is often incompatible with efficient camouflage. In paper III, I investigated if a seasonal related colour change in the chemically defended striated shieldbug (Graphosoma lineatum) is an adaptation to optimise a protective coloration by shifting from camouflage to aposematism between two seasons. The results confirm the hypothesis that the coloration expressed in the late summer has a camouflage function, blending in with the background. Further, I investigated if the internal pattern as such increased the effectiveness of the camouflage. Again, the results are in accordance with the hypothesis, as the patterned coloration was more difficult to detect than colorations lacking an internal pattern. This study shows how an aposematic species can optimise its defence by shifting from camouflage to aposematism, but in a different fashion than studied in paper I. The aim with study IV was to study the selection on aposematic signals by identifying characteristics that are common for colorations of aposematic species, and that distinguish them from colorations of other species. I compared contrast, pattern element size and colour proportion between a group of defended species and a group of undefended species. In contrast to my prediction, the results show no significant differences between the two groups in any of the analyses. One explanation for the non-significant results could be that there are no universal characteristics common for aposematic species. Instead, the selection pressures acting on defended species vary, and therefore affect their appearance differently. Another explanation is that all defended species may not have been selected for a conspicuous aposematic warning coloration. Taken together, my thesis shows that having a conspicuous warning coloration is not the only way to be aposematic. Also, aposematism and camouflage is not two mutually exclusive opposites, as there are prey species that exploit both strategies. It is also important to understand that prey animals are exposed to various selection pressures and trade-offs that affect their appearance, and determines what an optimal coloration is for each species or environment. In conclusion, I hold that the variation among warning colorations is larger and coloration properties that have been considered as archetypically aposematic may not be as widespread and representative as previously assumed...|$|E

40|$|It has {{generally}} been assumed that warningly coloured organisms pay a cost associated with their increased visibility, because naïve predators notice and eat them. This cost is offset by their enhanced protection from educated predators who associate the colour pattern with unprofitability. However, some {{studies have suggested that}} avoidance of novel prey by avian predators (“dietary conservatism”) can actually place novel colour morphs at a selective advantage over familiar ones, even when they are highly conspicuous. To test this idea, we experimentally simulated the appearance of a single novel-coloured mutant in small populations (20 individuals) of palatable artificial prey. The colour morph frequencies in each “generation” were determined by the relative survival of the previous generation under predation by birds. We used wild-caught European robins Erithacus rubecula foraging on pastry “prey” of different colours. The aim was to test whether prey selection by predators prevented or facilitated the novel colour morph persisting in the prey population over successive generations. We found that the novel colour morph quickly increased to fixation in 14 / 40 prey “populations”, and at least once each in 8 of the 10 birds tested. Novel mutants of the classic <b>aposematic</b> <b>colours</b> (red and yellow) reached fixation most frequently, but even the green and blue novel morphs both increased to fixation in 2 / 40 trials. Novel colours reached fixation significantly faster than could be accounted for by drift, indicating active avoidance by the birds. These results suggest that a novel colour morph arising in a prey population can persist and increase under the selective pressure imposed by predators, even to the local exclusion of the original morph, despite being fully palatable. The consequences of this finding are discussed in relation to receiver psychology, the evolution of aposematism and the existence of polymorphism in Müllerian mimics...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} visual {{signalling}} between plant and animals {{is often a}} combination of exciting discoveries {{and more often than}} not; highly controversial hypotheses. Plants and animals interact mutualistically and antagonistically creating a complex network of species relations to some extent suggesting a co evolutionary network. In this study, I investigate two basic research questions: the first is how plants utilize <b>aposematic</b> and cryptic <b>colours?</b> The second is how animals are affected by the colour signals broadcasted by plants? By using the avian eye model, I discover how visual signals/colours from plants are actually perceived, and the effects of these signals on birds (not human) perception. Aposematism and crypsis are common strategies utilized by animals, yet little evidence is known of such occurrences in plants. <b>Aposematic</b> and cryptic <b>colours</b> were evaluated by studying different colouration strategy through the ontogeny of two native heteroblastic New Zealand plants: Pseudopanax crassifolius and Elaeocarpus hookerianus. To determine the potential effect of colour signals on animals, I investigated an evolutionary theory of leaf colours constraining the conspicuousness of their fruit colour counterparts. Based on the available data, I also conducted a community level analysis about the effects of fruit colours and specific avian frugivores that might be attracted to them. Finally, I examined the fruit colour selection by a frugivorous seed dispersing insect; the Wellington Tree Weta (Hemideina crassidens). My result shows that <b>aposematic</b> and cryptic <b>colours</b> are successfully applied by plants to either warn or remain inconspicuous from browsing herbivores. The evidence I presented lends support to the Moa browsing hypothesis in relation to constraining the conspicuousness of their fruit colour counterparts. Based on the cryptic plant colourations. However, the same level of selective interaction could not be inferred for frugivore fruit colour selection based on avian vision. I demonstrated that leaf reflectance does not constrain/influence the conspicuousness of fruit colours. There was also no fruit colour diversity based on geographical location. Fruit colour alone is not sufficient to influence a specific frugivore assemblage. Other environmental factors and species interaction must be taken into account. Weta proved to possess colour vision capable of colour perception even in low light conditions. Weta also consistently selected naturally blue streaked and manipulated blue coloured fruits of Coprosma acerosa in a binary test. This supports the idea of weta co- evolving with fruit colours of certain divaricating plants in New Zealand. I suggest that the fruit colours of New Zealand are shaped by the combined selection pressure from birds, lizards/geckos and weta...|$|R
40|$|The one-trial passive {{avoidance}} {{learning task}} {{is commonly used}} in avian research to explore anatomical, cellular and molecular parameters of learning and memory. Many factors are known to influence the effectiveness and/or duration of such learning events. Combinations of novel odours, such as pyrazine, and <b>aposematic</b> <b>colours,</b> such as brig ht yellow or red, {{have been shown to}} induce a long-lasting aversion to food crumbs in 'visual' predators, including birds such as the domestic chick (1). The aim {{of this study was to}} (a) examine whether visual complexity played a role in the generation of an aversive response to a novel visual stimulus and (b) to establish whether the duration of memory of an aversive experience could be modified by altering the visual properties of the stimulus. In the first experiment, naﶥ domestic chicks were trained on a weakly aversive one-trial passive avoidance bead task, in which chicks were allowed to peck at a bead coated with a 10 % solution of the bitter-tasting and odorous substance methylanthranilate (MeA). The chicks were trained with (allowed to peck) one of four differently coloured beads dipped in 10 % MeA. Chrome, black, yellow or black-and-yellow striped beads were used. 'Recall' of the aversive bead was examined by presenting the (clean) training bead 24 h after training and monitoring avoidance to it compared to a 'neutral' white bead. A high proportion (63 %) of chicks trained with the black and yellow striped bead avoided it 24 h after training, whereas little or no avoidance was seen in response to chrome, yellow or black beads. In a second experiment naﶥ domestic chicks were all trained once only with a black and yellow striped bead coated in a 10 % MeA solution, but this time, were tested 24 h later, once only, with either a black, a yellow or a black and yellow striped bead. Nearly 60 % of chicks tested with a black and yellow striped bead showed avoidance of the bead, whereas only 23 % of those tested with a black bead and 14 % tested with a yellow bead showed avoidance. These results confirm the importance of complex warning colouration, when paired with a novel olfactory cue and a bitter taste, in avoidance learning. We conclude that the chicks' response to monochromatic colours (e. g. yellow or black) is not affected by their previous experience with a conspicuously patterned stimulus (yellow and black stripes). Moreover, it suggests a predisposition for chicks to attend to aversive cues associated with 'naturalistic' high contrast colour cue combinations such as black and yellow.

40|$|Alpine {{landscape}} with natural fragmentation restricts gene flow among populations and causes spatio-genetic structuring (high genetic differentiation) in species living there. Consequently, alpine habitat fragmentation and dispersal barriers should make isolated populations such as wood tiger moth (Parasemia plantaginis) populations prone to lose genetic diversity by local adaptation and fixation of fittest phenotype in each local population. This species {{is also known}} to be <b>aposematic.</b> Yellow <b>colour</b> on the males’ hind wings in wood tiger moth is presumed to work more efficiently against visual hunting predators due to increased conspicuousness. In addition, in field experiments with wood tiger moth, females with red hind wings were avoided more than those with orange hind wings. Therefore, yellow and red phenotypes are expected to reach fixation by directional selection in each given local population. Alternatively, uniform stabilizing selection imposed by predators can lead to constant allele frequencies throughout their distribution range. However, this species are very variable across its entire distribution both locally and regionally. Despite this dramatic variation for P. plantaginis throughout its range, {{it is not clear}} if observed phenotypic variation matches genetic divergence among populations. The main objective of the thesis was to investigate the spatio-temporal population genetic structure and differentiation of P. plantaginis population over two consecutive years in different Alpine regions in Italy, Austria, and Switzerland. The investigation was conducted using the pattern of variation at 10 microsatellite loci and in a 664 bp portion of the COI gene in the mtDNA. Expected heterozygosity was high and similar within all regions. Bayesian analyses revealed just one P. plantaginis population as a whole. This was supported by pairwise FST value, AMOVA and COI results, which indicated no differentiation among populations during two successive sampling years 2009 - 2010. Hence, high genetic diversity and weak population differentiation suggest high gene flow and/ or high population density in P. plantaginis. We speculate that in spite of extensive gene flow, this species remain morphologically polymorphic because the homogenizing effect of high gene flow has been compensated by differential environmental and ecological selective forces along the altitudinal gradient. However, given high gene flow (both current and past), and lack of strong post-settlement selection pressure, selective forces due to altitude are not strong enough to significantly differentiate the studied population in terms of microsatellites and mtDNA...|$|R
