25|$|In some Central African areas, {{malicious}} magic {{users are}} believed by locals {{to be the}} source of terminal illness such <b>as</b> <b>AIDS</b> and cancer. In such cases, various methods are used to rid the person from the bewitching spirit, occasionally physical and psychological abuse. Children may be accused of being witches, for example a young niece may be blamed for the illness of a relative. Most of these cases of abuse go unreported since the members of the society that witness such abuse are too afraid of being accused of being accomplices. It is also believed that witchcraft can be transmitted to children by feeding. Parents discourage their children from interacting with people believed to be witches.|$|E
