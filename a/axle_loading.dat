5|$|The {{maximum speed}} of {{suburban}} electric multiple units and locomotive hauled trains is 115km/h, with diesel multiple units permitted up to 130km/h {{on the same}} track, and up to 160km/h on specified lines. The maximum <b>axle</b> <b>loading</b> of freight wagons is 20 tonnes, with locomotives of up to 22 tonne <b>axle</b> <b>loading</b> operating.

5|$|Richard Maunsell was {{appointed}} CME of the SECR in 1913, following the enforced retirement of Harry Wainwright, {{who had left}} a range of competent but unspectacular locomotive classes that struggled {{to cope with the}} increased train lengths and loadings. Maunsell reviewed the situation and planned to introduce six standard classes – using only two boiler designs – which would work the entire traffic of the railway. The first of these was the Nclass 2-6-0, which gave the SECR a capable mixed-traffic locomotive. For the express passenger design that could cope with the heavy boat trains, Maunsell wanted to enlarge the existing Lclass 4-4-0 with Walschaerts valve gear and an enlarged superheater, but this design would have resulted in a too heavy <b>axle</b> <b>loading.</b> Maunsell's newly recruited assistants, G.H.Pearson and Harold Holcroft from the Great Western Railway at Swindon and James Clayton from the Midland Railway at Derby, had recently been involved in the design of large passenger tank engines and persuaded him to use the 2-6-4 wheel arrangement, which would allow the class to operate at high speeds on the poor-quality track in north Kent.|$|E
25|$|<b>Axle</b> <b>loading</b> limits a problem: For larger tank locomotives, {{it is hard}} to {{put much}} fuel and water aboard without {{requiring}} more axles than a rigid frame can handle.|$|E
30|$|The <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of a wagon is {{the total}} wagon weight (empty wagon weight[*]+[*]load on the wagon) resting on the <b>axle.</b> Higher <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> means fewer {{requirements}} of wagons, which is good from the operator and customer point of view. <b>Axle</b> <b>load</b> is therefore an important design factor in the engineering of railways, designed to tolerate a maximum weight‐per‐axle (<b>axle</b> <b>load).</b> If it exceeds the maximum rated <b>axle</b> <b>load,</b> it will cause more damage to the track so, for infrastructure managers, a lower or safer <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> limit is desirable. In this regard [23] remind us that: ‘the negative impacts of increased <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> occur primarily {{in the areas of}} track and bridge maintenance and renewal, and freight car maintenance’.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} is ballasted to a 25 t <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> - {{a reduction}} to 23 t <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> with reduced {{starting tractive effort}} is optional.|$|R
40|$|A new {{identification}} {{methodology for}} dynamic <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> using the superposition principle and influence surface concept was {{proposed in the}} companion paper, in which the effects of {{various factors such as}} bridge inertia force, measurement station, vehicle speed, traveling route, number of vehicles, road surface condition, and noise level were investigated through numerical simulations. In this study the proposed methodology is applied to identify the <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> of a test truck traveling across an existing bridge. The <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> time-histories are obtained and compared to the static <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> of the test truck. The results show that the identified dynamic <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> are fluctuating around their static counterparts. The dynamic impact factor and load amplification factor for the <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> under different vehicle speeds and road surface con-ditions are also studied. Being able to identify the real dynamic <b>axle</b> <b>loads,</b> the methodology can be applied to improve the current bridge-weigh-in-motion techniques that usually require a smooth road surface and slow vehicle movement to mini-mize the dynamic effects. The developed methodology will also be useful in identifying real dynamic vehicle forces on bridges, which will provide more reliable live load information for site-specific bridge fatigue assessment and performance evaluation...|$|R
25|$|Primarily {{designed}} for branch line and shunting services, the X class proved very successful on main line heavy goods duties as well. Their light <b>axle</b> <b>loading</b> {{made it possible}} for them to work {{on a wide variety of}} lines, and for many years after their introduction the X class were the dominant freight-hauler on Tasmanian railways. They were also used on passenger trains.|$|E
25|$|Railroads {{generally}} preferred locomotives {{with fewer}} axles, to reduce maintenance costs. The {{number of axles}} required was dictated by the maximum <b>axle</b> <b>loading</b> of the railroad in question. A builder would typically add axles until the maximum weight on any one axle was acceptable to the railroad's maximum <b>axle</b> <b>loading.</b> A locomotive with a wheel arrangement of two lead axles, two drive axles, and one trailing axle was a high-speed machine. Two lead axles were necessary to have good tracking at high speeds. Two drive axles had a lower reciprocating mass than three, four, five or six coupled axles. They were thus able to turn at very high speeds due to the lower reciprocating mass. A trailing axle was able to support a huge firebox, hence most locomotives with the wheel arrangement of 4-4-2 (American Type Atlantic) were called free steamers {{and were able to}} maintain steam pressure regardless of throttle setting.|$|E
25|$|The {{class were}} painted British Railways Freight Black without lining. The British Railways crest was {{located on the}} tender side. Given the British Railways power {{classification}} 9F, the locomotives were numbered in the 92xxx series, between 92000 and 92250. Because of its status as the last steam locomotive constructed at Swindon, No. 92220 was named Evening Star and turned out in British Railways Brunswick Green livery, which was usually reserved for express passenger locomotives. Several locomotives allocated to the Western Region, including no. 92220, bore a blue spot on the cab side below the number, to denote the <b>axle</b> <b>loading</b> under the former GWR's system of weight classification.|$|E
30|$|The {{weight of}} the vehicle {{is one of the}} {{parameters}} that can affect the response of the bridge directly. Especially when the load is dynamic, the response can be amplified with respect to static loads. Three different truck loads were employed to examine this parameter; partially (83 %) loaded HS 15 - 44 truck (SP- 17), fully loaded H 15 - 44 truck (SP- 0), and fully loaded HS 20 - 44 truck (SP- 14). SP- 0, SP- 14, and SP- 17 have properties of such weights. All the trucks represent a class-V vehicle (according to AASHTO) with one rear and one front axle. The distance between axles is 14 ft. H 20 - 44 truck has rear <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 32  kips and front <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 8  kips. H 15 - 44 truck has rear <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 24  kips and front <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 6  kips; whereas, the partially loaded H 15 - 44 truck has rear <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 20  kips and front <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 5  kips.|$|R
50|$|Initially the <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> was {{expected}} to be a light 18 t and the power at ~. In practice, the German locomotives had an <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 21 t (which is normal for this type of diesel locomotive).|$|R
30|$|The SUSTRAIL study (2014) puts a high {{priority}} on {{the improvement of the}} rail system as a whole and emphasises an increase in <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> limits (to 22.5  t / 25  t), depending on different operational scenarios [34]. Some infrastructures, usually ore lines, are designed and maintained for even higher <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> than those suggested above. For example, heavy haul transport with <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> up to 30  t is well developed in Sweden, although for specific circumstances that may not be copied to other railways in general. Advances in rail vehicle bogie and general rail vehicle dynamics, through better suspension characteristics, are expected to reduce direct damage to track and allow increasingly high <b>axle</b> <b>loads.</b> An increase of <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> on existing lines can be costly but, if this is done systematically at renewal of the lines, the marginal cost will often be small.|$|R
25|$|The Class GL {{was then}} {{transferred}} from Glencoe {{to work the}} line between Stanger and Empangeni in the late 1940s. However, since the loads on this route did not fully justify {{the use of the}} powerful Class GL while their great weight and high <b>axle</b> <b>loading</b> restricted them to mainlines laid with heavy rail, they were eventually replaced by less powerful, more modern and more economical Class GMA locomotives. Though briefly considered as hump shunters at Bloemfontein, the Class GL had outlasted its use and after some forty-two years of working the most difficult terrain on the SAR, they were withdrawn from service in 1972.|$|E
25|$|The New South Wales Government did {{not wish}} the company to remain as a main line operator, or to {{purchase}} it themselves; while South Australian train crews were not happy to work trains across the state border due {{to a loss of}} favourable industrial conditions. When the company purchased its diesel locomotives, a number of structures, including bridges, were modified (loading gauge and <b>axle</b> <b>loading)</b> to carry standard gauge, as the company ordered the wider bogies needed to operate on standard gauge. By 1967, the Silverton Tramway Company had offered to build a standard gauge line for a fixed sum, and transfer the line to New South Wales soon after. This line would have run from Cockburn to Broken Hill on an alignment that had some interaction with the existing Crystal Street station, but the Commonwealth Government rejected it as it wished for the line to be built on a new alignment.|$|E

40|$|In the past, damage {{resulted}} from load application to highway pavements {{focused primarily on}} the magnitude and frequency of <b>axle</b> <b>loads.</b> In recent years, the effect of increased truck tire pressure on flexible pavements responses has become a subject of great concern.

50|$|The <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of a {{wheeled vehicle}} {{is the total}} weight felt by the roadway for all wheels {{connected}} to a given axle. Viewed another way, it is the fraction of total vehicle weight resting on a given <b>axle.</b> <b>Axle</b> <b>load</b> is an important design consideration in the engineering of roadways and railways, as both are designed to tolerate a maximum weight-per-axle (axle load); exceeding the maximum rated <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> will cause damage to the roadway or rail tracks.|$|R
40|$|Traditional ways {{to acquire}} {{information}} on truck axle and gross weight are expensive {{and subject to}} bias, and {{this led to the}} development of weight-in-motion (WIM) techniques. Most of the existing WIM systems have been developed to measure only the static <b>axle</b> <b>loads.</b> However, dynamic <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> are also important. Some systems use instrumented vehicles to measure dynamic <b>axle</b> <b>loads,</b> but are subject to bias. All of this prompted the need to develop a system to measure the dynamic <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> using an unbiased random sample of vehicles. This paper aims to introduce four methods in determining such dynamic <b>axle</b> <b>loads</b> from bridge responses, The four methods are interpretive method I, interpretive method II, time domain method, and frequency-time domain method. Examples and experiments in laboratory show that all the four methods are feasible and the time domain method and frequency-time domain method give very good results even when 5 % noise is added to the simulated input data...|$|R
500|$|As {{the class}} {{appeared}} during the War, there were no heavily laden Continental Boat Trains from Dover and Folkestone, for {{which they had been}} designed. They were, however, used on express trains on the South Western Main Line to Southampton and to Exeter [...] In August 1945, a series of test runs were made between London Victoria and Dover and from October the class were used on the resumed Continental expresses. The prestigious Bournemouth Belle Pullman train was reinstated in October 1946 and entrusted to the class for the next two decades. However, their heavy <b>axle</b> <b>loading</b> and length meant that they were banned from many areas of the Southern Railway, and, later, the British Railways Southern Region network.|$|E
500|$|Maunsell and Holcroft {{completed}} {{plans for}} a new 3-cylinder locomotive in 1919. Designated N1, the new design was an attempt to increase the operational flexibility and power of the SECR 2-6-0 without substantially increasing <b>axle</b> <b>loading.</b> Holcroft's previous employment as an engineer involved with the GWR's 4300class meant that the N1 used the same Churchward features as the Nclass to aid standardisation and the manufacture of parts. These included the use of long-travel valves for free running at speed, right-hand drive in the cab and [...] driving wheels. The retention of the 2-6-0 wheel arrangement meant ample accommodation for the Nclass' tapered boiler with Belpaire firebox. As with the Nclass, detail design on the N1 was left to another of Maunsell's assistants, James Clayton, who brought functional Midland Railway influences to the design: the loading gauge-friendly shape of the cab, the tender and the large-diameter smokebox. The smokebox housed a large superheater, regulator valve and snifting (anti-vacuum) valves. [...] The N1 also retained Walschaerts valve gear on both outside cylinders.|$|E
500|$|The next {{development}} was {{the introduction of}} surface milling, which began at Hatfield in 1986 and at Swinefleet in the following year. Once an area had been drained, all vegetation {{was removed from the}} surface, and a thin layer of peat was removed by a mechanical harvester. It was stockpiled on the moors, and later loaded into wagons by a Hymec loader, to be bagged at the works. Most peat by this time was used for compost or in growbags. The milled peat was much finer than the previous peat sods, and the mesh-sided wagons were unsuitable for transporting it. A programme of fitting wooden boards to the insides of the wagons was begun, but by 1989, solid steel wagons were being fabricated, reusing the frames from the original wagons. All the wagons at Hatfield had been upgraded by May 1990, with those at Swinefleet completed afterwards. Trains of the new wagons were much heavier, particularly when loaded with milled peat, and the existing locomotives were inadequate. Tenders were invited for some more powerful locomotives, and three machines were ordered from Schöma of Germany. Two were delivered to Hatfield in 1990, and the third went to Swinefleet in 1991. Each consisted of a CHL-60G master unit, rated at [...] with a bonnet and cab, and a CHL-60T slave unit, looking more like a flat-bed truck, with a second hydraulic motor. They were much more powerful than the engines they replaced, with the four-axle arrangement ensuring that the <b>axle</b> <b>loading</b> was low enough for the existing track, and they were very popular with their operators. By the late 1990s, they were wearing out, and enquiries were made, with a view to purchasing replacements. Alan Keef designed a Bo-Bo locomotive for use on the moors, but the cost was too great, and the company rebuilt two of the Schoma locomotive and slave units. The work included replacing the original 5-cylinder engines with 6-cylinder models, improving the sanding gear and driver's seating arrangements, and fitting a more reliable air-conditioning system for the cab. Lack of funds prevented the third Schoma being upgraded. They worked on Thorne Moors removing stockpiled peat until 21 October 2005, and on Hatfield Moors until 2006. They were stored at Hatfield once rail operation had ceased, and were still there in 2008.|$|E

50|$|The {{first two}} figures gave the <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> in Mp. However, {{in order to}} ensure numbers fell within the {{allocated}} range, the number 50 had to be added. So, for example, locomotives with an <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> of 10 Mp were given the serial number 60.|$|R
30|$|Aluminothermic welding of rails {{is widely}} used within the railway {{industry}} for in-track welding during re-railing operations and defect removal [3]. The process suffers from variable quality in finished welds due to inherent limitations in the field. Under high <b>axle</b> <b>load</b> conditions, the recent failures in aluminothermic welds represent {{one of the main}} risks for a catastrophic derailment and a major limitation to further increases in <b>axle</b> <b>loads.</b> Improved rail welding and track maintenance practices would be required to meet the performance demands of higher <b>axle</b> <b>loads.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The lighter <b>axle</b> <b>loading</b> {{allowed the}} trains to travel faster than {{conventional}} services along lines not suited to full-speed running, {{such as the}} Edinburgh to Aberdeen line.

The Corporation applied for an increase in the <b>axle</b> <b>loading,</b> specifying the weight as [...] "over 42 tons". Milner, the newest of the two locomotives, dating from 1879, did not perform well, and was replaced by a Hudswell Clarke 0-6-0 side tank, also named Milner in May 1909. The original Milner was sold to the North Wales Granite Company at Conwy in 1914. Following discussions with the Board of Trade in 1906, the Corporation and the North Eastern Railway had obtained permission for three passenger trains per week to pass over the goods yard and sidings at Pateley Bridge, so that excursions could continue up to Lofthouse between June and September only. Despite the agreement, when the first excursion was due to make the journey on 14 September 1907, the NER decided not to allow their stock to pass onto the Nidd Valley Light Railway, nor to allow the Corporation engine and carriages to come to their station, and so the passengers had to walk between the two stations. In order to avoid confusion for parcels traffic, Lofthouse station became Lofthouse-in-Nidderdale on 12 December 1907, and Wath became Wath-in-Nidderdale in February 1908 for similar reasons.|$|E
