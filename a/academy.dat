40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} and influential social and intellectual phenomena of the early modern period, Italian <b>academies</b> have traditionally been studied individually or in the context of specific cities, and then mostly in the Italian language. While this approach has resulted in a wealth of information on single institutions and figures, the absence of a critical reading of the broader phenomenon remains an important lacuna in the scholarship on Italian culture and the early modern period in Europe. Cutting across various disciplines from history of the book to literary criticism to intellectual history, this far-reaching volume traces the network of early modern Italian <b>Academies</b> and explains how they served as the basis for later intellectual networks such as the European 'Republique des lettres'. This book examines Italian <b>academies</b> as one {{of the most}} important social and intellectual phenomena of the Italian peninsula in the early modern period. It argues that <b>academies</b> should be studied as networks of individuals and his critical reading adds an important aspect of early modern social networks and their impact on European culture. Italian <b>Academies</b> and Their Networks, 1525 - 1700 : From Local to Global is divided into four chapters that explore the representations of Italian <b>academies</b> from the sixteenth century to our days, <b>academies</b> and politics in Venice, illustrated biographies as 'facebooks' in four different <b>academies,</b> and Italian <b>academies</b> an as the basis for later networks.
