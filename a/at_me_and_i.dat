25|$|I {{just want}} to say that when I was 16 or 17 years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at Duluth National Guard Armory and I was three feet away from him… and he looked <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> just have some kind of feeling that he was – I don’t know how or why – but I know he was with us all the time we were making this record in some kind of way.|$|E
500|$|Virgil Earp {{reported}} afterward, [...] "Two shots {{went off}} right together. Billy Clanton's {{was one of}} them." [...] Wyatt testified, [...] "Billy Clanton leveled his pistol at me, but I did not aim at him. I knew that Frank McLaury had {{the reputation of being}} a good shot and a dangerous man, and I aimed at Frank McLaury." [...] He said he shot Frank McLaury after both he and Billy Clanton went for their revolvers: [...] "The first two shots were fired by Billy Clanton and myself, he shooting <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shooting at Frank McLaury." [...] Morey agreed that Billy Clanton and Wyatt Earp fired first. Clanton missed, but Earp shot Frank McLaury in the stomach.|$|E
500|$|Barbara Steele as Elizabeth. [...] This was Steele's {{first film}} since her {{break-through}} horror performance in Mario Bava's Black Sunday (1960). [...] The actress recalled {{that she was}} [...] "in awe" [...] of Price during the production and described the filming of their final scene together as surprisingly physical: [...] "Our major confrontation where he strangles me was done in one take…He really went <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had the bruises on my throat to prove it. [...] Afterward, he was so concerned he had hurt me—a perfect gentleman—a truly kind figure {{in spite of his}} image." [...] While watching the daily rushes of the movie, Corman became convinced that Steele's [...] "thick working class English accent" [...] was not blending well with the other cast members, so after the filming was completed he had all of her dialogue dubbed by a different actress.|$|E
60|$|Ham glanced <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{suddenly}} <b>I</b> felt a {{shock that}} struck me back.|$|R
60|$|She made a dive <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> before <b>I</b> {{could escape}} caught {{me in her}} strong young arms <b>and</b> hugged <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> seriously, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{began to}} {{perceive}} a certain coldness in her pretty eyes. [...] "I suppose your distances are so great?" ...|$|R
500|$|On May 19, Debbie Swenson {{placed a}} call to her biggest supporter, Randall van der Woning. She told him that Kaycee had not {{actually}} been her own child, but rather a foster daughter. She requested that he keep Kaycee's identity secret. Van der Woning did as requested and kept the information to himself; however, this had the side effect of allowing the Metafilter investigation to continue. As more and more evidence mounted {{that the story of}} Kaycee had been cobbled together using misdirection and borrowed facts, Swenson emailed the truth to him, and he, in turn, posted it to the In Living Colours blog on May 20: Kaycee Nicole had never existed. [...] "I didn't know the reactions would be so strong", Swenson said. [...] "I knew it was wrong and every day it ate <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> couldn't take it." [...] She now claimed that Kaycee was a composite of three people she had known with cancer, none of whom were her daughter.|$|E
2500|$|.....continued to be {{friendly}} to the audience, which made them even madder, {{because they were so}} mad and I didn't care! They were shaking their fists <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thought that at any minute there'd be a riot. So I took it as far as I thought I could, and then thanked them and left.|$|E
2500|$|Wainwright became {{addicted}} to crystal meth {{in the early}} 2000s and temporarily lost his vision. His addiction reached its peak in 2002, during {{what he described as}} [...] "the most surreal week of my life." [...] During that week, he played a cameo role in the UK comedy television program Absolutely Fabulous, spent several nights partying with George W. Bush's daughter Barbara, enjoyed a [...] "debauched evening" [...] with his mother and Marianne Faithfull, sang with Anohni of Antony and the Johnsons for Zaldy's spring 2003 collection, and experienced recurring hallucinations of his father throughout. He decided after that he [...] "was either going to rehab or I was going to live with my father. I knew I needed an asshole to yell <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> felt he fit the bill." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, isn't it? And {{so early}} in the voyage, too." [...] She looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> could not forbear a smile of {{appreciation}} she smiled back.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{stranger}} laughed <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>at</b> first; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{found some}} {{pleasure in the}} humiliation I then felt. But it did not last long, for presently he grew sober <b>and</b> advised <b>me</b> {{to run away from}} home and seek adventure.|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> hesitated. <b>I</b> {{felt that}} I was paying the double penalty {{of being a}} young man, and of being perhaps a little too eager as well.|$|R
60|$|And Charmian looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{knew she}} {{wondered}} where I had got it.|$|E
60|$|Captain Seccombe stared <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> at Captain Seccombe. Reuben Colenso stood {{wringing}} his cap.|$|E
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{saw that}} he did not know what I meant. I explained.|$|E
60|$|A tear {{burst from}} out its source and fell upon the {{emaciated}} hand of my father. He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> wistfully, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> felt a slight pressure that denoted affection.|$|R
60|$|She {{stood looking}} <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and,</b> of course, <b>I</b> {{stood looking at}} her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye! I {{had meant}} {{to speak to you}} of this ere now--but you always avoid me ... you scarce will look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> ... <b>and</b> ... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wished to ask you if I had {{offended}} you?" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{he looks}} <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> seen {{that he had}} got it in the neck, right enough.|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{saw that}} she was putting in a bit of the old drenched-irises stuff.|$|E
60|$|After {{the noisy}} {{congratulations}} were {{over and the}} Rube had gone, Spears looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> looked at him.|$|E
6000|$|Cotton looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> interrogatively, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> nodded. [...] "You {{can safely}} trust even family secrets to Mr. Dixon. He is, or will be, {{one of the}} {{foremost}} lawyers in the Dominion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are {{you going}} to speak in the tows hall to-night?" [...] the boy demanded. I {{admitted}} it. He went off, pausing once to stare back <b>at</b> <b>me....</b> Maude <b>and</b> <b>I</b> walked on.|$|R
60|$|Another effort set <b>me</b> <b>at</b> liberty, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> stood erect before him.|$|R
6000|$|DOWN {{the stone}} stairs Girls with their large {{eyes wide with}} tragedy Lift looks of shocked and momentous emotion [...] up <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> smile.|$|E
6000|$|Now Quilla looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> rose {{to speak}} but could not, since all {{that came from}} my lips was laughter. At length I said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You put me out, {{standing}} there {{staring at me}} through your horrid spectacles!" [...] she said irritably. [...] "Don't look <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will tell you directly." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{when they}} set the bier down on the threshold, they looked at one another, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> whispered. <b>I</b> knew why. They {{felt as if it}} were not right to lay him down in the same quiet room.|$|R
50|$|Don Calfa, 76, American actor (The Return of the Living Dead, Weekend <b>at</b> Bernie's, <b>Me,</b> Myself <b>and</b> <b>I).</b>|$|R
60|$|Beatrice Haldane looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> again <b>I</b> {{felt that}} she could still draw my soul to the surface for {{inspection}} if she desired to. I also fancied she knew her power, and wished to exercise it, but not from pride in its possession.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} her. She was {{gazing at the}} Ghost. I {{followed}} her gaze, but could see nothing unusual. She looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> looked inquiry back.|$|E
60|$|But {{he looked}} so serious after he had made me that light answer, that the Major raised his eyebrows <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> raised mine at the Major.|$|E
60|$|She did not answer, {{but looked}} <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{told her to}} shut her left eye, but to be very {{particular}} not to turn around again without lowering her pistol.|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> more attentively, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{noticed a}} quick {{movement}} {{of her hands}} towards each other.|$|R
60|$|The {{report of}} a rifle, {{discharged}} near <b>at</b> hand, awakened <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> looked around to see the scout reloading his rifle.|$|R
