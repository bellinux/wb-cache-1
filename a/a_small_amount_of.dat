5|$|At high {{pressures}} (more {{than about}} 20atm or twoMPa), {{a mixture of}} helium and oxygen (heliox) can lead to high-pressure nervous syndrome, a sort of reverse-anesthetic effect; adding <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> nitrogen to the mixture can alleviate the problem.|$|E

5|$|Chirality {{can also}} be {{incorporated}} into a phase by adding a chiral dopant, which may not form LCs itself. Twisted-nematic or super-twisted nematic mixtures often contain <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> such dopants.|$|E
5|$|Helium {{produced}} between 1930 and 1945 {{was about}} 98.3% pure (2% nitrogen), which was adequate for airships. In 1945, <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> 99.9% helium was produced for welding use. By 1949, commercial quantities of Grade A 99.95% helium were available.|$|E

50|$|Most legumes contain tannins. Red-colored beans {{contain the}} most tannins, and white-colored beans have the least. Peanuts without shells {{have a very}} low tannin content. Chickpeas (garbanzo beans) have <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> tannins.|$|R
5|$|The ground {{currently}} has a seated stand {{along one side}} of the pitch, which was constructed in 1992, three covered terraces and <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> uncovered terracing. In 1998 the ground was flooded when a nearby reservoir overflowed and the river which runs alongside the ground burst its banks.|$|E
5|$|Appendicitis {{may present}} with vomiting, {{abdominal}} pain, and <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> diarrhea {{in up to}} 33% of cases. This {{is in contrast to}} the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis. Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea. Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea. One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.|$|E
5|$|At {{standard}} temperature and pressure, thorium is slowly attacked by water, {{but does not}} readily dissolve in most common acids, {{with the exception of}} hydrochloric acid, where it dissolves leaving a black insoluble residue of ThO(OH,Cl)H. It dissolves in concentrated nitric acid containing <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> catalytic fluoride or fluorosilicate ions; if these are not present, passivation can occur, as with uranium and plutonium.|$|E

5|$|Chemists {{who studied}} {{platinum}} dissolved it in aqua regia (a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids) to create soluble salts. They always observed <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> a dark, insoluble residue. Joseph Louis Proust {{thought that the}} residue was graphite. The French chemists Victor Collet-Descotils, Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy, and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin also observed the black residue in 1803, but did not obtain enough for further experiments.|$|E
5|$|Fallout from {{atmospheric}} {{nuclear testing}} prior to 1980 contributed <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> californium to the environment. Californium isotopes with mass numbers 249, 252, 253, and 254 {{have been observed}} in the radioactive dust collected from the air after a nuclear explosion. Californium {{is not a major}} radionuclide at United States Department of Energy legacy sites since it was not produced in large quantities.|$|E
5|$|Finally, in {{sympatric}} speciation species diverge without geographic isolation or changes in habitat. This form is rare since even <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> gene flow may remove genetic differences between {{parts of a}} population. Generally, {{sympatric speciation}} in animals requires the evolution of both genetic differences and non-random mating, to allow reproductive isolation to evolve.|$|E
30|$|This study aims {{to present}} a new {{application}} of the framework in a full scale lignite production, where the initial resource model generation is automated based on a short-term model. This would immediately increase the production efficiency in a real mining environment, by simply giving the opportunity to react on the changes of the resource model with newly gained information. Moreover, using the real-time updating framework would also decrease the frequency of material misallocation. Having an improved resource model helps to have <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> actual lignite being incorrectly allocated to the waste dump. And similarly, <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> actual waste send to the stockpile.|$|R

5|$|First {{recorded}} and surveyed in 1840, North Island {{has been a}} seasonal camp for western rock lobster fishermen {{since the beginning of}} the 20th century, and this remains the principal focus of human activity on the island.

5|$|For {{several years}} in the 1950s and 1960s, a {{by-product}} of potassium production called Alkarb was a main source for rubidium. Alkarb contained 21% rubidium, with the rest being potassium and <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> caesium. Today the largest producers of caesium, such as the Tanco Mine, Manitoba, Canada, produce rubidium as a by-product from pollucite.|$|E
5|$|Most 17th-century Muscovites {{received}} little education, {{and there were}} low levels of literacy even among the nobility, education for whom typically consisted of a little reading, writing, and <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> history and geography. Religious scholars were usually the exception to this rule and were often also taught grammar, mathematics, and foreign languages. Two of Tsar Alexis' children—Feodor, and his sister Tsarevna Sophia—received a thorough education from the religious scholars of Kiev, and could speak Latin and Polish.|$|E
30|$|The main {{difference}} between CountingLab’s method and the benchmark model {{lies in the}} construction of many small models that use <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> data, each. It seems plausible that noise has a greater negative effect on such approaches.|$|R

50|$|Some {{environmental}} situations, {{such as the}} tadpoles {{living in}} <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> water, which would naturally heat to higher temperatures, is known to trigger the tadpoles to develop at a faster rate, developing into adults frogs within 14 days.|$|R
