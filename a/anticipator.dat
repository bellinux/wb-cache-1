Based on an empirical analysis of a diverse set of consumer and industrial innovations introduced in the US over the past 100 years, we find that entrants during the pre-firm take-off stage (termed Creators) have higher survival rates than later entrants that enter between the firm and sales take-off (termed <b>Anticipators),</b> and both of these entrant types have higher survival rates than firms that enter after the sales take-off (termed Followers). Notably, survival rates for Creators and <b>Anticipators</b> do not depend on entry time within the cohort group, i. e., what matters is whether an entrant enters {{before or after the}} take-off, not whether it entered first in its cohort.

40|$|With the {{increased}} penetration of intermittent {{renewable energy sources}} (RESs) in future grids (FGs), balancing between supply and demand will become more dependent on demand response (DR) and energy storage. Thus, FG feasibility studies will need to consider DR for modelling nett future demand.

The conventional demand model in the optimisation formulation is augmented by including the aggregated effect of numerous users equipped with rooftop photovoltaic (PV) -storage systems. The proposed model is suited for system studies at higher voltage levels in which users are assumed to be price <b>anticipators.</b> As a case study, the effect of the demand model is studied on the load profile, balancing and loadability of the Australian National Electricity Market in 2020 with {{the increased}} penetration of RESs.

This paper is concerned with Patinkin's sociology. Hi approach by emphasizing the "central message " of a particular work, neglects the received sociological theory of knowledge in a way that compromises his entire investigation. This contention is illustrated by looking at Keynes's German contenders. They had anticipated Keynesian theories and applied them in the years before the General Theory was published. Nevertheless, they rejected aspects of Keyne ian economics after the appearanced the General Theory.

40|$|Empirical {{findings}} suggest that members of socially disadvantaged groups who join a better-valued group through individual achievement tend to express low concern for their disadvantaged ingroup (e. g., denial of collective discrimination, low intent to initiate collective action). In the present research, we investigated whether this tendency occurs solely for individuals who have already engaged in social mobility, or also for individuals who psychologically prepare themselves, that is ‘anticipate’, social mobility. Moreover, we examined the role of group identification in this process. In two studies, {{we looked at the}} case of ‘frontier workers’, that is people who cross a national border every day to work in another country where the salaries are higher thereby achieving a better socio- economic status than in their home-country. Study 1 (N = 176) examined attitudes of French nationals (both the socially mobile and the non-mobile) and of Swiss nationals toward the non-mobile group. As expected, results showed that the mobile French had more negative attitudes than their non-mobile counterparts, but less negative attitudes than the Swiss. In Study 2 (N = 216), we examined ingroup concern at different stages of the social mobility process by comparing the attitudes of French people who worked in Switzerland (mobile individuals), with those who envisioned (<b>anticipators),</b> or not (non-anticipators), to work in Switzerland. The findings revealed that anticipators’ motivation to get personally involved in collective action for their French ingroup was lower than the non-anticipators’, but higher than the mobile individuals’. Moreover, we found that the decrease in ingroup concern across the different stages of social mobility was accounted for by a lower identification with the inherited ingroup. These findings corroborate the deleterious impact of social mobility on attitudes toward a low- status ingroup, and show that the decrease in ingroup concern already occurs among individuals who anticipate moving up the hierarchy. The discussion focuses {{on the role of the}} discounting of inherited identities in both the anticipation and the achievement of a higher-status identity...|$|R
40|$|While {{monitoring}} eye movements during visual world paradigm studies, {{earlier research}} {{showed that the}} appropriate second noun phrase (NP 2) is anticipated as upcoming referent before this NP is auditorily encountered, when enough information is available to guide the anticipation process. Anticipatory effects are determined in both SVO-languages (e. g. English) and verb-final languages using case-markers (e. g. Japanese). Dutch lacks case- marking but allows verb-second SVO and verb-final SOV sentences. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether participants anticipate an upcoming NP 2 object in Dutch SVO and SOV sentences. As SOV sentences are embedded clauses that cannot occur on their own, they were preceded by a main clause. Since we wanted to compare sentence constructions that were contentwise as equal as possible we did the same for the main SVO clauses. While linguistically encountering the two preceding main clauses, the different structure and prosody indicated already the word order of the upcoming critical sentence, i. e. SVO or SOV. For the SVO sentences, the preceding main clause, the subject NP 1 and the verb provided information for object NP 2 anticipation. In the SOV case, the information provided by the subject NP 1 becomes extra important, as it was the only linguistic element that could be used as a guider of what element was coming next. To investigate whether the NP 1 can lead NP 2 anticipation, concrete and abstract NP 1 s preceded the NP 2, such as the abstract NP 1 ‘girl’ and the concrete NP 1 ‘pilot’. It was hypothesized that if the NP 2 was concrete, the lexical semantics of the NP provided enough information to come up with an upcoming NP 2 object in SOV sentences, without the need of a verb. Overall, results showed that participants primarily preferred to look at the NP 1 image during the spoken sentence. After sentence offset, a wrap-up effect of fixations to the NP 2 was determined in all conditions, possibly indicating a late interpretation and integration of the NP 2 with the previous constituents. Across all conditions, the NP 2 image received proportionally as much fixations as the distractor images until sentence offset. This demonstrates that in both SVO and SOV sentences, upcoming NP 2 s were not anticipated. A possible explanation is that Dutch listeners are less pro-active <b>anticipators</b> because of the flexibility of Dutch word orders. The anticipatory process becomes too costly as the risk of anticipating upcoming constituents incorrectly is too high...|$|R

40|$|Part I of this Article briefly {{examines}} {{the concept of}} “corporate governance” and argues for dating the concept’s origins to the debates of the 1920 s. Part II then moves on to examine early scholarly and popular discussions {{of the separation of}} ownership and control. After surveying the historical developments that produced the recognizably modern corporate economy {{around the turn of the}} century, it examines early scholarly and popular discussions of the separation of ownership and control, focusing on three major thinkers, Louis D. Brandeis, Walter Lippmann, and Thorstein Veblen. It argues that, while each of these authors examined the separation of ownership and control, they did not agree on its contours or impact. They did not necessarily see the separation of ownership and control as a problem for shareholders, and some did not see it as a problem at all. To portray these authors simply as <b>anticipators</b> of Berle and Means is to misunderstand the arguments they actually made and to miss the ways in which ideas about the separation of ownership and control were slowly developed. Part III, the heart of this Article, focuses on Berle and Means’s most significant predecessor in the debates over corporate governance, William Z. Ripley, and his 1920 s crusade for better corporate governance, culminating in his book Main Street and Wall Street. It discusses how Ripley, already one of the best-known economists of his day, launched a campaign in 1925 against financial and legal innovations that were, he claimed, allowing corporate managers to wrest control of corporations away from their owners—shareholders scattered across the country. In speeches and a series of articles in the Atlantic magazine, Ripley hammered corporate leaders and pushed for a range of reforms in corporate law and governance intended to provide new protections for shareholders. His campaign drew wide attention and gained notice from Wall Street and the President of the United States. Ripley was not alone during the 1920 s; his work is only the best-remembered of a series of scholarly and popular works that turned a spotlight on the separation of own- ership and control and the spread of shareholding. Thus, it was during the 1920 s that recognizably modern views of the separation of ownership and control, and its consequences, took form. Finally, in Part IV, the Article turns to Berle and Means. It discusses both their connections to earlier theorists and crusaders, and the ways in which they transcended their predecessors. The Modern Corporation and Private Property broke with its predecessors by providing a technically sophisticated and empirically based legal and economic analysis of the separation of ownership and control, and by setting that analysis within a narrative describing how the modern corporation had come to dominate American economy and society...|$|R

In the controller, a precursor population meter implemented as a finite filter of the power history provides effective and accurate estimation of the delayed neutron precursor population. In this dissertation, techniques of transient identification are developed to detect unexpected events. Neural networks are used to identify different types of transients based on the distinct features extracted from the transients by matching pursuit decomposition or by shiftable wavelet transformation. The techniques have been shown to work well in extensive tests...|$|E
40|$|Two {{kinds of}} knowledge, i. e. {{declarative}} knowledge and procedural knowledge, should be represented {{and used in}} applied Al system in medicine. The authors constructed a knowledge representation form which is suitable for the description of declarative knowledge. Basic classifications can be represented in a form of hierarchy. The authors introduced description of relations between hierarchies(cross-hierarchy representation) instead of former 2 -dimensional tabular descriptions. The authors applied this form of knowledge representation to an antibiotics medication counseling system called <b>ANTICIPATOR...</b>|$|E
40|$|This short {{communication}} {{deals with}} the introduction of the concept of <b>anticipator,</b> which is one who anticipates, in the framework of computing anticipatory systems. The definition of anticipation {{deals with the}} concept of program. Indeed, the word program, comes from “pro-gram” meaning "to write before" by anticipation, and means a plan for the programming of a mechanism, or a sequence of coded instructions that can be inserted into a mechanism, or a sequence of coded instructions, as genes or behavioural responses, that is part of an organism. Any natural or artificial programs are thus related to anticipatory rewriting systems, as shown in this paper. All the cells in the body, and the neurons in the brain, are programmed by the anticipatory genetic code, DNA, in a low-level language with four signs. The programs in computers are also computing anticipatory systems. It will be shown, at one hand, that the genetic code DNA is a natural <b>anticipator.</b> As demonstrated by Nobel laureate McClintock [8], genomes are programmed. The fundamental program deals with the DNA genetic code. The properties of the DNA consist in self-replication and self-modification. The self-replicating process leads to reproduction of the species, while the self-modifying process leads to new species or evolution and adaptation in existing ones. The genetic code DNA keeps its instructions in memory in the DNA coding molecule. The genetic code DNA is a rewriting system, from DNA coding to DNA template molecule. The DNA template molecule is a rewriting system to the Messenger RNA molecule. The information is not destroyed during the execution of the rewriting program. On the other hand, it will be demonstrated that Turing machine is an artificial <b>anticipator.</b> The Turing machine is a rewriting system. The head reads and writes, modifying the content of the tape. The information is destroyed during the execution of the program. This is an irreversible process. The input data are lost.

40|$|Wireless {{networks}} {{introduce new}} possibilities for computer networking. They also bring some new problems, while enhancing some already established ones. One new {{problem is a}} network 2 ̆ 7 s increased sensitivity to its environment, while the issues of failure detection, and efficient network routing, are examples of traditional problems that have been exacerbated. The possibility and severity of partition on a network is another problem {{that has been made}} worse by the use of wireless solutions. In the case of wireless partitions, there is less scope for predicting a failure than in traditional networks, or judging it correctly as such once it has happened. This is due to the current lack of experience in predicting the characteristics of the wireless medium, as well its inherent unpredictability. This document describes and evaluates solutions for a network location information dissemination protocol, and a framework for a wireless network partition <b>anticipator</b> that uses this location information service. The location service presents a process for relative and absolute user location tracking, network view construction, and routing table construction. The partition <b>anticipator</b> framework analyses the output of the location dissemination service and makes inferences for network quality based on an expert system knowledge base. Potential partitions between nodes, as well as excellent quality connections are highlighted as being interesting...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{combined}} perspective over groupware and attentive user interfaces. The problem that we address is how to attenuate the distracting effects of the multiple interruptions that characterize computer-mediated collaboration, while maintaining the necessary notion of group awareness. We introduce a framework of group attention consisting of collaboration facets, information flows, and attentive devices. Based on known psychological factors we propose four such devices: the time separator, the opportunity seeker, the change emphasizer, and the activity <b>anticipator.</b> Finally, we demonstrate the framework role {{in the design of}} an electronic brainstorming tool...|$|E
