5|$|In total, {{ten people}} were {{admitted}} to hospital with radiation sickness: the four scrap collectors, the two scrapyard employees, the scrapyard owner, her husband, her mother, and her maid. Of these, four people (those {{working at the}} scrapyard) were estimated to have received radiation doses of over 6 gray (Gy). All patients were ultimately referred to Rajavithi Hospital, where they received inpatient care. All {{but one of the}} patients developed <b>agranulocytosis</b> or bicytopenia (depletion of white blood cells and/or platelets). Several also developed burns, and one (the first scrap collector) had to have his finger amputated. Three patients (the two scrapyard workers and the owner's husband) ultimately died of uncontrolled infection and sepsis, all within two months of exposure.|$|E
25|$|The terms <b>agranulocytosis,</b> granulocytopenia and {{neutropenia}} {{are sometimes}} used interchangeably. <b>Agranulocytosis</b> implies a more severe deficiency than granulocytopenia. Neutropenia indicates a deficiency of neutrophils (the most common granulocyte cell) only.|$|E
25|$|Clozapine-induced <b>agranulocytosis</b> can be transient.|$|E
25|$|Previous {{hypersensitivity}} (including jaundice, <b>agranulocytosis,</b> etc.) to phenothiazines, especially chlorpromazine, {{or any of}} the excipients in {{the formulation}} being used.|$|E
25|$|In <b>agranulocytosis,</b> the {{concentration}} of granulocytes (a major class of white blood cells that includes neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils) drops below 500 cells/mm³ of blood.|$|E
25|$|Clozapine {{carries a}} black box warning for drug-induced <b>agranulocytosis.</b> Without monitoring, <b>agranulocytosis</b> occurs in about 1% {{of people who}} take {{clozapine}} {{during the first few}} months of treatment; the risk of developing it is highest about three months into treatment, and decreases substantially thereafter, to less than 0.01% after one year. Within the context of trials, the potentially dangerous white blood cell decline seems to be more frequent in children and adolescents and in the elderly than in young adults or people of middle age.|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{effects of}} {{captopril}} include cough due {{to increase in}} the plasma levels of bradykinin, angioedema, <b>agranulocytosis,</b> proteinuria, hyperkalemia, taste alteration, teratogenicity, postural hypotension, acute renal failure, and leukopenia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Agranulocytosis</b> may be asymptomatic, or may {{clinically}} {{present with}} sudden fever, rigors and sore throat. Infection of any organ may be rapidly progressive (e.g., pneumonia, urinary tract infection). Septicemia may also progress rapidly.|$|E
25|$|Not {{licensed}} {{for use in}} the US and Canada. Licensed for use in Australia and the UK. Can cause {{blood dyscrasias}} (including <b>agranulocytosis)</b> and consequently both the BNF and AMH recommend regular complete blood count monitoring.|$|E
25|$|To be precise, {{neutropenia}} is {{the term}} normally used to describe absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) of less than 500 cells per microlitre, whereas <b>agranulocytosis</b> is reserved for cases with ANCs of less than 100 cells per microlitre.|$|E
25|$|Hematologic effects, such as neutropenia, <b>agranulocytosis</b> {{and other}} blood dyscrasias, have {{occurred}} during therapy with ACE inhibitors, especially {{in patients with}} additional risk factors (see Warnings). Patients should be advised to report symptoms such as sore throat or fever to their physician.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} manifestations of a {{hypersensitivity}} reaction to sulfa drugs are rash and hives. However, {{there are several}} life-threatening manifestations of hypersensitivity to sulfa drugs, including Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, <b>agranulocytosis,</b> hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, fulminant hepatic necrosis, and acute pancreatitis, among others.|$|E
25|$|Clozapine was {{synthesized}} in 1958 by Wander AG, a Swiss pharmaceutical company, {{based on}} the chemical structure of the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine. The first test in humans in 1962 was considered a failure. Trials in Germany in 1965 and 1966 {{as well as a}} trial in Vienna in 1966 were successful. In 1967 Wander AG was acquired by Sandoz. Further trials took place in 1972 when clozapine was released in Switzerland and Austria as Leponex. Two years later it was released in West Germany, and Finland in 1975. Early testing was performed in the United States around the same time. In 1975, after reports of <b>agranulocytosis</b> leading to death in some clozapine-treated patients, clozapine was voluntarily withdrawn by the manufacturer. Clozapine fell out of favor {{for more than a decade}} despite unclear reasons for the <b>agranulocytosis</b> which occurred in Finland, the rate of which was 20 times higher than had been reported in any other country. However, when studies demonstrated that clozapine was more effective against treatment-resistant schizophrenia than other antipsychotics, the FDA and health authorities in most other countries approved its use only for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and required Restricted Distribution, a Patient Registry and regular hematological monitoring to detect granulocytopenia, before <b>agranulocytosis</b> develops. In December 2002, clozapine was approved in the US for reducing the risk of suicide in schizophrenic or schizoaffective patients judged to be at chronic risk for suicidal behavior. In 2005 FDA approved criteria to allow reduced blood monitoring frequency.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} {{tranquilizer}} or antipsychotic medication, chlorpromazine (Thorazine), a typical antipsychotic, {{was discovered in}} 1951 and introduced into clinical practice shortly thereafter. Clozapine (Clozaril), an atypical antipsychotic, fell out of favor due to concerns over drug-induced <b>agranulocytosis.</b> Following research indicating its effectiveness in treatment-resistant schizophrenia {{and the development of}} an adverse event monitoring system, clozapine re-emerged as a viable antipsychotic. According to Barker (2003), the three most-accepted atypical drugs are clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine. However, he goes on to explain that clozapine is usually the last resort when other drugs fail. Clozapine can cause <b>agranulocytosis</b> (a decreased number of white blood cells), requiring blood monitoring for the patient. Despite the effectiveness of clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, agents with a more favorable side-effect profile were sought-after for widespread use. During the 1990s, olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine were introduced, with ziprasidone and aripiprazole following in the early 2000s. The atypical anti-psychotic paliperidone was approved by the FDA in late 2006.|$|E
25|$|Cobb {{returned}} to New York City in 1953 and found {{work as an}} interpreter and translator. Her friend Warren Broglie, manager of the Waldorf Astoria, referred clients to her. Towards the end of 1953, Cobb worked briefly for Foster Wheeler, a firm that was building a refinery in Colombia. In the summer of 1954, Cobb was treated for <b>agranulocytosis</b> at Beth-El Hospital in New York.|$|E
25|$|Clozapine {{also carries}} five black box warnings, {{including}} warnings for <b>agranulocytosis,</b> {{central nervous system}} depression, leukopenia, neutropenia, seizure disorder, bone marrow suppression, dementia, hypotension, myocarditis, orthostatic hypotension (with or without syncope) and seizures. Lowering of the seizure threshold may be dose related and slow initial titration of dose may decrease the risk for precipitating seizures. Slow titration of dosing may also decrease the risk for orthostatic hypotension and other adverse cardiovascular side effects.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone may rarely {{cause more}} severe side effects such as anaphylaxis, renal failure, {{hepatitis}} (two reported cases, neither serious), <b>agranulocytosis,</b> DRESS syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Five cases {{of breast cancer}} in patients who took spironolactone for prolonged periods of time have been reported. It should also be used with caution in people with some neurological disorders, anuria, acute kidney injury, or significant impairment of renal excretory function with risk of hyperkalemia.|$|E
25|$|When {{carbamazepine}} is concurrently {{used with}} clozapine, {{it has been}} shown to decrease plasma levels of clozapine significantly thereby decreasing the beneficial effects of clozapine. Patients should be monitored for “decreased therapeutic effects of clozapine if carbamazepine” is started or increased. If carbamazepine is discontinued or the dose of carbamazepine is decreased, therapeutic effects of clozapine should be monitored. The study recommends carbamazepine to not be used concurrently with clozapine due to increased risk of <b>agranulocytosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Antiproliferative {{actions on}} bone marrow and GI tissue: Due to the drug's {{preference}} for rapidly proliferating tissues, bone marrow depression (anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, or even rarely <b>agranulocytosis)</b> may occur. Aplastic anemia {{has also been}} seen. Bone marrow toxicity can be irreversible and may cause death, particularly in immunocompromised patients. GI toxicity may be severe or rarely fatal and consists of anorexia, abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, duodenal ulcer, GI hemorrhage, nausea, vomiting, and ulcerative colitis.|$|E
25|$|Burimamide {{was still}} insufficiently potent for oral administration, and further {{modification}} of the structure, based on modifying the pKa of the compound, {{led to the development}} of metiamide. Metiamide was an effective agent; it was associated, however, with unacceptable nephrotoxicity and <b>agranulocytosis.</b> The toxicity was proposed to arise from the thiourea group, and similar guanidine analogues were investigated until the ultimate discovery of cimetidine. The compound was synthesized in 1972 and evaluated for toxicology by 1973. It passed all trials.|$|E
25|$|The {{potency of}} burimamide {{was still too}} low for oral administration. And efforts on further {{improvement}} of the structure, based on the structure modification in the stomach due to the acid dissociation constant of the compound, {{led to the development}} of metiamide. Metiamide was an effective agent; however, it was associated with unacceptable nephrotoxicity and <b>agranulocytosis.</b> It was proposed that the toxicity arose from the thiourea group, and similar guanidine analogues were investigated until the discovery of cimetidine, which would become the first clinically successful H2 antagonist.|$|E
25|$|The Centers for Disease Control traced {{outbreaks}} of <b>agranulocytosis</b> among cocaine users, in the US and Canada between March 2008 and November 2009, {{to the presence}} of levamisole in the drug supply. The Drug Enforcement Administration reported that, as of February 2010, 71% of seized cocaine lots coming into the US contained levamisole as a cutting agent. Levamisole is an antihelminthic (i.e. deworming) drug used in animals. The reason for adding levamisole to cocaine is unknown, although it can be due to their similar melting points and solubilities.|$|E
25|$|Treatment with antithyroid {{medications}} must {{be given}} for six months to two years to be effective. Even then, upon cessation of the drugs, the hyperthyroid state may recur. The risk of recurrence is about 40–50%, and lifelong treatment with antithyroid drugs carries some side effects such as <b>agranulocytosis</b> and liver disease. Side effects of the antithyroid medications include a potentially fatal reduction {{in the level of}} white blood cells. Therapy with radioiodine is the most common treatment in the United States, while antithyroid drugs and/or thyroidectomy are used more often in Europe, Japan, and {{most of the rest of}} the world.|$|E
25|$|The main antithyroid {{drugs are}} {{carbimazole}} (in the UK), methimazole (in the US), and propylthiouracil/PTU. These drugs block the binding of iodine and coupling of iodotyrosines. The most dangerous side effect is <b>agranulocytosis</b> (1/250, more in PTU). Others include granulocytopenia (dose-dependent, which improves on cessation of the drug) and aplastic anemia. Patients on these medications {{should see a}} doctor if they develop sore throat or fever. The most common side effects are rash and peripheral neuritis. These drugs also cross the placenta and are secreted in breast milk. Lugol's iodine {{may be used to}} block hormone synthesis before surgery.|$|E
25|$|One-third of {{patients}} have their tumors discovered {{because they have}} an associated autoimmune disorder. As mentioned earlier, {{the most common of}} those conditions is myasthenia gravis (MG); 10–15% {{of patients}} with MG have a thymoma and, conversely, 30–45% of patients with thymomas have MG. Additional associated autoimmune conditions include thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity, pure red cell aplasia and Good syndrome (thymoma with combined immunodeficiency and hypogammaglobulinemia). Other reported disease associations are with acute pericarditis, <b>agranulocytosis,</b> alopecia areata, ulcerative colitis, Cushing's disease, hemolytic anemia, limbic encephalopathy, myocarditis, nephrotic syndrome, panhypopituitarism, pernicious anemia, polymyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, scleroderma, sensorimotor radiculopathy, stiff person syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus and thyroiditis.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} which {{antipsychotic}} {{to use for}} a specific patient is based on benefits, risks, and costs. It is debatable whether, as a class, typical or atypical antipsychotics are better. Both have equal drop-out and symptom relapse rates when typicals are used at low to moderate dosages. There is a good response in 40–50% of patients, a partial response in 30–40%, and treatment resistance (failure of symptoms to respond satisfactorily after six weeks to two of three different antipsychotics) in the remaining 20%. Clozapine is an effective treatment for those who respond poorly to other drugs, but it has the potentially serious side effect of <b>agranulocytosis</b> (lowered white blood cell count) in 1–4% of patients.|$|E
25|$|Another underrecognized and {{potentially}} life-threatening side effect spectrum is gastrointestinal hypomotility, which may manifest as severe constipation, fecal impaction, paralytic ileus, bowel obstruction, acute megacolon, ischemia or necrosis. Colonic hypomotility {{has been shown}} to occur in up to 80% of people prescribed clozapine when gastrointestinal function is measured objectively using radiopaque markers. Clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility currently has a higher mortality rate than the better known side effect of <b>agranulocytosis.</b> A Cochrane review found little evidence to help guide decisions about the best treatment for gastrointestinal hypomotility caused by clozapine and other antipsychotic medication. Monitoring bowel function and the preemptive use of laxatives for all clozapine-treated people {{has been shown to}} improve colonic transit times and reduce serious sequelae.|$|E
25|$|Since thiazide diuretics {{affect the}} {{transport}} of electrolytes and water in the kidney, they can be responsible for abnormalities of water balance and electrolyte levels. Removal of too much fluid can cause volume depletion and hypotension. Various electrolyte abnormalities may result, including hyponatremia (low sodium), hypokalemia (low potassium), hypochloremia (low chloride), hypomagnesemia (low magnesium), hypercalcemia (high calcium), and hyperuricemia (high uric acid). These may result in dizziness, headache, or heart arrhythmias (palpitations). Serious, though rare, side effects include aplastic anemia, pancreatitis, <b>agranulocytosis,</b> and angioedema. Metolazone, like other thiazide diuretics, may unmask latent diabetes mellitus or exacerbate gout, especially by interacting with medicines used to treat gout. In addition, thiazide diuretics, including metolazone, are sulfonamides; those with hypersensitivity to sulfonamides ("sulfa allergy") may also be allergic to metolazone.|$|E
25|$|The dose-limiting {{side effects}} are liver damage, lung disease and immunosuppression. The most common side effects (occurring in >1% of those treated with it) are, in {{approximately}} descending order of frequency: diarrhea, respiratory tract infections, hair loss, high blood pressure, rash, nausea, bronchitis, headache, abdominal pain, abnormal liver function tests, back pain, indigestion, urinary tract infection, dizziness, infection, joint disorder, itchiness, weight loss, loss of appetite, cough, gastroenteritis, pharyngitis, stomatitis, tenosynovitis, vomiting, weakness, allergic reaction, chest pain, dry skin, eczema, paraesthesia, pneumonia, rhinitis, synovitis, cholelithiasis and shortness of breath. Whereas uncommon side effects (occurring in 0.1-1% of those {{treated with the}} drug) include: constipation, oral thrush, stomatitis, taste disturbance, thrombocytopenia and hives. Rarely (in 0.1% of those treated with it) it can cause: anaphylaxis, angiooedema, anaemia, <b>agranulocytosis,</b> eosinophilia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, vasculitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, severe infection, interstitial lung disease, cirrhosis and liver failure.|$|E
25|$|Iron {{overload}} is {{an unavoidable}} consequence of chronic transfusion therapy, necessary {{for patients with}} beta thalassemia. Iron chelation is a medical therapy that avoids the complications of iron overload. The iron overload can be removed by Deferasirox, an oral iron chelator, which has a dose- dependent effect on iron burden. Every unit of transfused blood contains 200–250mg of iron and the body has no natural mechanism to remove excess iron Deferasirox is a vital part in the patients health after blood transfusions. During normal iron homeostasis the circulating iron is bound to transferrin, but with an iron overload, the ability for transferrin to bind iron is exceeded and non-transferrin bound iron is formed. It represents a potentially toxic iron form due to its high propensity to induce oxygen species and is responsible for cellular damage. The prevention of iron overload protects patients from morbidity and mortality. The primary aim is to bind to and remove iron from the body and a rate equal to the rate of transfusional iron input or greater than iron input. During clinical trails patients that received Deferasirox experienced no drug-related neutropenia or <b>agranulocytosis,</b> which was present with other iron chelators. Its long half life requires it to be taken once daily and provides constant chelation. Cardiac failure is a main cause of illness from transfusional iron overload but deferasirox demonstrated the ability to remove iron from iron-loaded myocardial cells protecting beta thalassemia patients from effects of required blood transfusions.|$|E
500|$|The {{choice of}} which {{antipsychotic}} to use {{is based on}} benefits, risks, and costs. It is debatable whether, as a class, typical or atypical antipsychotics are better. Amisulpride, olanzapine, risperidone, and clozapine {{may be more effective}} but are associated with greater side effects. Typical antipsychotics have equal drop-out and symptom relapse rates to atypicals when used at low to moderate dosages. There is a good response in 40–50%, a partial response in 30–40%, and treatment resistance (failure of symptoms to respond satisfactorily after six weeks to two or three different antipsychotics) in 20% of people. Clozapine is an effective treatment for those who respond poorly to other drugs ("treatment-resistant" [...] or [...] "refractory" [...] schizophrenia), but it has the potentially serious side effect of <b>agranulocytosis</b> (lowered white blood cell count) in less than 4% of people.|$|E
