5|$|Realizing {{that the}} {{phenomenon}} {{occurring in the}} room is far older than the house, Jill theorizes that the stone tape can be recorded over again and <b>again,</b> <b>like</b> magnetic recording tape; the maid's death was simply the most recent and clearest recording. Independently continuing her research, Jill realizes that the maid's death was masking a much older recording, left many thousands of years ago. Brock cruelly dismisses her findings, and forces Jill to take a two-month leave to prevent her from continuing her research.|$|E
5|$|As a Postelsia alga grows, its stipe thickens in {{the same}} manner as a tree's trunk. The cells beneath the epidermis, called the meristoderm, divide rapidly to form rings of growth, <b>again,</b> <b>like</b> a tree. However, the greater {{flexibility}} of Postelsia stipe over that of a woody tree makes for some distinct differences. Postelsia must be thicker than a tree of equal height in order to support itself. However, the stipe is very much more suited to the coastal habitat, as it allows the seaweed to bend with the constant wave action. Such an environment would cause the inflexible, woody tree to break.|$|E

50|$|During 1942 and 1943, the {{national}} championship was reinstated, but <b>again,</b> much <b>like</b> the first two times, there were problems and the championship was canceled. <b>Again</b> much <b>like</b> in 1939 and 1941, there were only regional championships held during 1944 and 1945, and again, these title are now considered national championships.|$|R

25|$|It is {{said that}} a certain marvellous and {{incredible}} occurrence, and very like a fable, happens every year {{to the people of}} Lucomoryae, namely, that they die on the 27th of November, which among the Russians is dedicated to St. George, and come to life <b>again</b> <b>like</b> the frosts in the following spring, generally on the 24th of April.|$|E
25|$|He almost won the 2008 NAPA Auto Parts 200, {{dominating}} <b>again</b> <b>like</b> in 2007 {{but when}} a thunderstorm blew the track, Ambrose tried to slow for a pit stop. Nonetheless his car slid across pit road too fast unable to stop because of the waters; thus he earned a black-flag for a pass-through penalty. He ended up third in the final results behind race winner Ron Fellows.|$|E
25|$|This gag has two mouthguards, {{similar to}} those worn by {{football}} and hockey players. One rests on the lower teeth of the wearer while the other is against the top. <b>Again,</b> <b>like</b> sports mouthguards, these mouthguards can be softened in boiling water to fit {{to the mouth of}} the wearer. The mouthguards are attached to a front faceplate, like most plug gags, and straps from the front to the back.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} in a law of 21 February 1795 set steps of return to freedom of religion and reconciliation with the since 1790 refractory Catholic priests, but any religious signs outside churches or private homes, such as crosses, clerical garb, bell ringing, remained prohibited. When the people's enthousiasm for attending church grew to unexpected levels the government backed out and in October 1795 <b>again,</b> <b>like</b> in 1790, required all priests to swear oaths on the Republic.|$|E
25|$|The movie {{takes place}} everywhere, {{and it takes}} place nowhere. It's a city built of pieces of cities. A corner from one place, another from some place else. So, you don't really know where you are.

You're there, but you don't know where you are. It's like every time you travel, you'll be lost.|$|E
25|$|<b>Again,</b> <b>like</b> chylomicrons, VLDL {{particles}} circulate and encounter {{lipoprotein lipase}} (LPL) expressed on endothelial cells. Apolipoprotein C-II activates LPL, causing hydrolysis of the VLDL particle {{and the release}} of glycerol and fatty acids. These products can be absorbed from the blood by peripheral tissues, principally adipose and muscle. The hydrolyzed VLDL particles are now called VLDL remnants or intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs). VLDL remnants can circulate and, via an interaction between apolipoprotein E and the remnant receptor, be absorbed by the liver, or they can be further hydrolyzed by hepatic lipase.|$|E

25|$|Stokes, <b>again</b> <b>like</b> {{his brother}} Frederick, played cricket for Blackheath Cricket Club and for Kent from 1877 to 1880. He made his {{first-class}} debut for Kent on 4 June 1877 in the seven-wicket victory against Hampshire. He played two more matches during the 1877 season, {{but did not}} appear for Kent over the following two campaigns. He played for an R Page XI against Colchester Garrison in a one-day first-class match on 12 August 1879. Stokes made his final first-class appearance on 22 July 1880, scoring the winning runs in a 10-wicket win over Sussex.|$|E
25|$|His wide-ranging {{interests}} {{included the}} Greeks and the Romans. <b>Again,</b> <b>like</b> all other Arabic historians, he was unclear on Greece before the Macedonian dynasty that produced Alexander the Great. He {{is aware that}} there were kings before this, but is unclear on their names and reigns. He also seems unfamiliar with such additional aspects of Greek political life as Athenian democratic institutions. The same holds for Rome prior to Caesar. He is, though, the earliest extant Arabic author to mention the Roman founding myth of Romulus and Remus.|$|E
25|$|A revised {{prototype}} with longer-span wings, the Firefly III {{was built}} to Specification N21/26 as a carrier-based fighter to replace the Fleet Air Arm's Fairey Flycatchers, first flying on 17 May 1929. Like the land-based fighter, it was rebuilt with more metal components as the Firefly IIIM, and <b>again</b> <b>like</b> the Firefly II, was beaten by a design produced by Hawker, {{in this case the}} Hawker Nimrod. Although no production orders ensued, the Firefly IIIM was fitted with floats and used as a trainer by the RAF's High Speed Flight preparing for the 1931 Schneider Trophy race.|$|E

As in every other community in the City, there will be zero tolerance for behavior which doesn’t respect the celebrated diversity of our communities.

The Home For Halloween website will help promote your events so please let us know about what you have planned in your community.|$|E
25|$|Internally, the Athlon is a fully seventh {{generation}} x86 processor, {{the first}} of its kind. Like the AMD K5 and K6, the Athlon dynamically buffers internal micro-instructions at runtime resulting from parallel x86 instruction decoding. The CPU is an out-of-order design, <b>again</b> <b>like</b> previous post-5x86 AMD CPUs. The Athlon utilizes the Alpha 21264's EV6 bus architecture with double data rate (DDR) technology. This means that at 100MHz, the Athlon front side bus actually transfers at a rate similar to a 200MHz single data rate bus (referred to as 200MT/s), which was superior to the method used on Intel's Pentium III (with SDR bus speeds of 100MHz and 133MHz).|$|E
25|$|In 1670, however, hetman Doroshenko tried {{once again}} to take over Ukraine, and in 1671 Khan of Crimea, Adil Giray, {{supportive}} of the Commonwealth, was replaced with a new one, Selim I Giray, by the Ottoman sultan. Selim entered into an alliance with the Doroshenko's Cossacks; but <b>again</b> <b>like</b> in 1666–67 the Cossack-Tatar forces were dealt defeats by Sobieski. Selim then renewed his oath of allegiance to the Ottoman Sultan and pleaded for assistance, to which the Sultan agreed. Thus an irregular border conflict escalated into a regular war in 1671, as the Ottoman Empire was now prepared to send its regular units onto the battlefield {{in a bid to}} try to gain control of that region for itself.|$|E

25|$|<b>Again,</b> <b>like</b> Salerno, {{there were}} serious {{problems}} with the landings. The commander, Lieutenant General John P. Lucas, did not exploit as aggressively as {{he might have done}} and was relieved for it. Lucas believed that if he had pushed too far, his forces could have been cut off by the Germans. But as the whole purpose of the invasion was to attack the German lines behind Monte Cassino and break out into the Italian areas which were undefended, the idea that Lucas thought he should land then sit and do nothing is incredible. The Germans came even closer than Salerno to breaking up the beachhead. They pushed through the defences to the last line before the sea. Again massive firepower on the Allied side saved the beachhead.|$|E
25|$|At A {{level in}} 2010, Trafford {{performed}} the best and, <b>again</b> <b>like</b> its results at GCSE, {{is one of}} the best areas in England. The lowest performing area is, again, Knowsley but followed by Rochdale. Knowsley has had some dreadful results at A-level; Halewood Academy, its last school sixth-form, closed in 2016; there is now no school-based A-level provision in Knowsley, it is provided by the Knowsley Community College. For traditional counties, Lancashire gets excellent results at A-level, being one of the best in England. Areas also performing above the England average, in order of results, are Blackpool, Warrington, Wigan, Cheshire West and Chester, Bury, Cumbria, Wirral, and Stockport. Blackpool performs not particularly well at GCSE, yet produces much better results at A level – even better than Cheshire West and Chester, and the third best in the region.|$|E
25|$|By taking {{command in}} person in Natal, Buller had allowed the overall {{direction}} of the war to drift. Because of concerns about his performance and negative reports from the field, he was replaced as Commander in Chief by Field Marshal Lord Roberts. Roberts quickly assembled an entirely new team for headquarters staff and he chose military men from far and wide: Lord Kitchener (Chief of Staff) from the Sudan; Frederick Russell Burnham (Chief of Scouts), the American scout, from the Klondike; David Henderson from the Staff College; Neville Bowles Chamberlain from Afghanistan; and William Nicholson (Military Secretary) from Calcutta Like Buller, Roberts first intended to attack directly along the Cape Town – Pretoria railway but, <b>again</b> <b>like</b> Buller, was forced to relieve the beleaguered garrisons. Leaving Buller in command in Natal, Roberts massed his main force near the Orange River and along the Western Railway behind Methuen's force at the Modder River, and prepared to make a wide outflanking move to relieve Kimberley.|$|E
