2500|$|As the taped {{conversation}} continued, {{the jury}} heard Saldívar's {{reaction to the}} news of Selena's death after her phone picked up a local radio station's signal. In an angry voice, Saldívar asked Young why he had kept the singer's condition from her, since she wanted to visit Selena at the hospital, believing she was still alive. Young told Saldívar not to believe the radio announcement, {{and that he did}} not know about Selena's current condition. The conversation then switched to Saldívar blaming Quintanilla, Jr. for the murder claiming that he threatened to kill her. She explained to Young that she bought the gun for protection after finding her car tires deliberately slashed. She also told him how Quintanilla, Jr. sexually abused her by [...] "sticking a knife" [...] in her vagina, threatening to murder her if she went to the police. When asked about what happened in her motel room, Saldívar exclaimed: [...] "I bought this gun to kill myself, not her, and she told me, 'Yolanda, I don't want you to kill yourself.' <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about that when I took it out and pointed it to my head, and when I pointed it to my head, she opened the door. I said 'Selena, close that door,' and when I did that gun went off." ...|$|E

He {{just dropped}} in <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about you--at least I was--and I had heard that Harry St. Maur was paying you marked {{attention}} before you came west--and--and that some people thought you were engaged--and so--and so--" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{happened}} to be down at Corky's place when the first copies of The Children's Book of American Birds bobbed up. Muriel Singer was there, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> of things in general {{when there was a}} bang at the door and the parcel was delivered.|$|E
5000|$|... 2015: Luke Ablett, {{for when}} {{speaking}} about the murder of Masa Vuketic, saying [...] "another woman killed by a man <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about why women shouldn't walk in parks. What is wrong Australia?" ...|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} we {{perceived}} the veteran observer had vanished <b>and</b> that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> to ourselves.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've been {{haunted by}} the memory of you. I <b>was</b> rude <b>and</b> stupid. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about the suffrage--and I rather scoffed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Belsky? It was {{the first}} night I saw him, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about Americans, {{and he began to}} tell me about an American friend of his, who was very conscientious. I thought it must be you the fust moment," [...] said Clementina, smiling with an impersonal {{pleasure}} in the fact.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thady, you know, was dining with me yesterday, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> over Ballycloran and old Flannelly's money matters; and I was, you see, {{just making}} a bad tenant's excuses to him, {{and so on}} from one thing to another, till we got talking about you, Feemy;--in short, he didn't seem quite happy about you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, is it you, Mr. Barker?" [...] {{he asked}} in a note of surprise. [...] "I am glad to see you. I had been {{intending}} to come and look you up again. Will you sit down? Mr. Evans was here the other night, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> of you. I hope you are all well?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I only {{mentioned}} his name, because, as I said, {{he was over}} with us the other day at Framley, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> all <b>talking</b> about your affair." ...|$|R
60|$|That evening, when I {{was quite}} cooled down, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> to Mr. Poplington about the hay-making and the free-and-easy {{way in which}} {{everybody}} came together, {{he was a good}} deal surprised that we should think that there was anything uncommon in that, coming from a country where everybody was free and equal. Jone was smoking his pipe, and when it draws well and he's had a good dinner and I haven't anything particular to say, he often likes to talk slow and preach little sermons.|$|R
6000|$|... "Call Mr. Finn A 1 to his face! Well,--upon my honour I don't {{know why}} I should not. Lord Chiltern says he rides beautifully, <b>and</b> if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about riding I might do so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{perfectly}} ridiculous of me," [...] she murmured, [...] "but I was just telling Dick--he is back again for another four days' leave <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about you at luncheon time--that I wasn't feeling very well, and your coming in {{like that was}} quite a shock. I am absolutely all right now. Do please sit down and explain," [...] she begged, motioning him to a chair.|$|E
5000|$|Although Blaze of Noon {{could have}} been {{dismissed}} as out-of-date and more 1930s than 1940s fare, Bosley Crowther noted in his favourable review in The New York Times, [...] "... youthful filmgoers who were mere babes in Lindbergh's salad days (<b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> to a youngster recently who didn't even know who Lindbergh was) will probably find this aerial romance an agreeably entertaining thing." ...|$|E
5000|$|Co-writer Odie Blackmon told Roughstock that [...] "Buxton had {{a little}} piece of the verse and melody and the word 'pieces.' We all started talking about it and what it meant to us. None of us are young folks any more. We've all lived some life <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about the pieces of our lives ... all the {{different}} pieces that has brought us to where we are today, whether they were good or bad pieces." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike today's AS, autistic psychopathy {{could be}} found in people of all levels of intelligence, {{including}} those with intellectual disability. Asperger defended the value of high-functioning autistic individuals, writing [...] "We are convinced, then, that autistic people have their place in the organism of the social community. They fulfill their role well, perhaps better than anyone else could, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> of people who as children had the greatest difficulties and caused untold worries to their care-givers." [...] Asperger also believed some would be capable of exceptional achievement and original thought later in life. His paper was published during wartime and in German, so it was not widely read elsewhere.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{asked you}} when it was you last saw him--previous, I mean, to his second descent at Venice. You wouldn't say, <b>and</b> as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> of a matter {{comparatively}} more important I let it pass. But the fact remains, you know, my dear, that you haven't told me." ...|$|R

5000|$|Because it was {{the last}} year of the plague, and the year of the great fire of London, which of course ended the plague by burning the slums down ... In this kind of game you’re always {{looking for a way to}} up the tension and frankly make the world a little more perilous, and justify why there aren’t giant crowds of people at the market. Then people had the idea for swarms of rats, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> {{independently}} about possession, and we wondered if you should be able to possess rats and if they could clean up corpses so you don’t have to hide them. All these pieces just worked together.|$|E
5000|$|During this time, Busiek {{had many}} letters {{published}} in comic book letter columns, and originated {{the theory that}} the Phoenix was a separate being who had impersonated Jean Grey, and that therefore Grey had not died — a premise which made its way from freelancer to freelancer, and which was eventually used in the comics. Busiek explains, [...] "A couple of years later, after I’d broken in, I attended my first convention as a pro, in Ithaca, New York, and I stayed at Roger Stern's house. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about how much we liked the new X-Men, and he said, 'It's just a pity there's no way to bring Jean Grey back,' and I said, 'Sure there's a way, there's always a way.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|By this time, Cline {{controlled}} her own career, {{making it}} clear to all involved that she could stand up to any man, verbally and professionally, {{and was ready to}} challenge them if they interfered with her. At a time when concert promoters often cheated stars by promising to pay them after the show but skipping out with the money before the concert ended, Cline demanded her money before she took the stage: Her [...] "No dough, no show" [...] became the rule. According to friend Roy Drusky in The Real Patsy Cline: [...] "Before one concert, we hadn't been paid. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about who was going to tell the audience that we couldn't perform without pay. Patsy said, 'I'll tell 'em!' And she did!" [...] Dottie West recalled with amazement some 25 years later that [...] "It was common knowledge around town that you didn't mess with 'The Cline!'" ...|$|E
5000|$|In his 1944 paper, as Uta Frith {{translated}} from the German in 1991, Asperger wrote, [...] "We are convinced, then, that autistic people have {{their place in the}} organism of the social community. They fulfill their role well, perhaps better than anyone else could, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> of people who as children had the greatest difficulties and caused untold worries to their care-givers." [...] Based on Frith's translation, however, Asperger initially stated: [...] "Unfortunately, in the majority of cases the positive aspects of autism do not outweigh the negative ones." [...] Psychologist Eric Schopler wrote in 1998:Asperger’s own publications did not inspire research, replication, or scientific interest prior to 1980. Instead, he laid the fertile groundwork for the diagnostic confusion that has grown since 1980.|$|R

5000|$|On March 16, 2016, Fabolous {{confirmed}} he was {{releasing a}} project with Jadakiss, [...] "Oh yeah man, {{he came to}} my party out at CIAA in Charlotte <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about doing a couple things and one was to do a mixtape…I wanna do a mixtape, but we're gonna go through iTunes too." [...] In October 2016, Lenny “Kodak Lens” Santiago, Senior Vice President of Roc Nation, told fans {{to prepare for the}} joint project. “Be excited about Fabolous and Jadakiss and what they’ve <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> about for months,” he told Rap-Up. On January 17, 2017, the official trailer for the album was released. It's a blend of The Blair Witch Project, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and Friday the 13th. It's about a young woman running for her life, only to be disappointed, in tears, and haunted by a familiar yet frightening tune.|$|R
5000|$|... "That's Why God Made the Radio" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Joe Thomas, Brian Wilson, Jim Peterik, and Larry Millas for the American rock band The Beach Boys. It was the first new single from the band in 20 years and was {{included}} on the band's 29th studio album, That's Why God Made the Radio. The album was recorded {{to coincide with the}} band's 50th anniversary, which featured a reunion tour of the surviving co-founders. According to the song's co-writer Peterik: and I were at an Italian restaurant <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about radio and how great songs used to sound through the AM radio coming through your oval speaker on your Plymouth Valiant and I said, [...] "Man, that was the best sound of all," [...] and Brian said, [...] "Yeah, that's why God made the radio." [...] Of course, I wrote that down. He didn't realize how brilliant it was, or maybe he did, but that's when we wrote that song.|$|E
50|$|Edman {{spent his}} early years at the Institute {{designing}} and producing a machine that automated protein sequencing. In 1958 RMIT graduate Geoffrey Begg was employed as a junior laboratory assistant to Edman and became intimately involved in the project. Describing how the idea came to fruition, Begg said, “I was sitting having {{a cup of tea}} with some of the research blokes one day, just after I’d joined in 1958, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about how repetitive their analysis work was…I asked them why they didn’t invent a machine to speed up all the repetitive work. I was only a laboratory assistant and they all laughed, so I forgot about it. But apparently Dr Edman had been thinking about the same thing. He heard about this and asked me if I could make a model of a possible machine.” The next day, Begg brought an electric motor from home and aided by his glass blowing skills, showed that the idea was feasible. Begg spent much of the following year working on the machine, which {{came to be known as}} ‘Matilda’.|$|E
5000|$|... "I had an Irish ship captain {{sitting in}} the port of New York with a ship full of munitions destined for Israel. He had phony bills of lading and {{was to take the}} {{shipment}} outside the three-mile limit and transfer it on to another ship. But a large sum of money had to be handed over, and I didn't know how to get it to him. If I walked out the door carrying the cash, the Feds would intercept me and wind up confiscating the munitions."I went downstairs to the bar and Sinatra came over, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking.</b> I don't know what came over me, but I told him what I was doing in the United States and what my dilemma was. And {{in the early hours of}} the following morning I walked out the front door of the building with a satchel, and the Feds followed me. Out the back door went Frank Sinatra, carrying a paper bag filled with cash at $1 million. He went down to the pier, handed it over, and watched the ship sail".|$|E

50|$|Studies {{of how we}} know {{in ethics}} divide into {{cognitivism}} and non-cognitivism; {{this is similar to}} the contrast between descriptivists and non-descriptivists. Non-cognitivism is the claim that when we judge something as right or wrong, this is neither true nor false. We may for example be only expressing our emotional feelings about these things. Cognitivism can then be seen as the claim that when we talk about right <b>and</b> wrong, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about matters of fact.|$|R
40|$|Spatio-temporal {{databases}} {{deal with}} geometries changing over time. In general, geometries cannot only change in dis-crete steps, but continuously, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> about moving objects. If only {{the position in}} space of an object i s relevant, then moving point is a basic abstraction; if also the extent is of interest, then the moving region abstraction captures moving as well as growing or shrinking regions. We propose {{a new line of}} research where moving points and moving regions are viewed as three-dimensional (2 D space + time) or higher-dimensional entities whose structure and behavior is captured by modeling them as abstract data types. Such types can be integrated as base (attribute) data types into relational, object-oriented, or other DBMS data models; they can be implemented as data blades, cartridges, etc. for ex-tensible DBMSs. We expect these spatio-temporal data types to play a similarly fundamental role for spatio-temporal data-bases as spatial data types have played for spatial databases. In this paper we consider the need for modeling spatio-temporal data types on two different levels of abstraction. ...|$|R
5000|$|One {{day came}} to him an {{official}} call. He went to the officers affairs and met with Major General Saad Salim who said to him, there are instructions for {{him to return to}} the service. He said to him, sorry, and while speaking with him entered the office Major General Abdel-Moneim Khalil who had served with him in Yemen and whom he knew. He asked him what are you doing here? He said to him: They sent him and they want him to return to the army and he refused. He said to him, wait for me until I pray 'Asr (afternoon). He then returned and said to him, I'll tell you a story then you can make your decision and then said: We were in a meeting with President Anwar Sadat <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about tanks and he asked us: [...] "Where is Orabi?" [...] We told him Orabi on pension. He said: Orabi to be back to the Army. When Major General Abdel-Moneim Khalil told him this dialogue, he was influenced by the words of President Sadat. He said to Major General Saad Salim: Yes I will return to service.|$|E

[...] I go [...] "Well, it has to happen or I quit", and he’s like [...] "Well, it's not going to", and I go [...] "Okay, then I quit." [...] So then I just did the Europe tour. I did a whole Europe tour, 60 shows in 65 days, and I did it all with people who I was mad at and I'd quit on, and as the thing went on and I realized how much pressure was off of me, it just became more fun, and then when I left I was really sad to go.|$|E

2500|$|Asperger's 1944 work, Autistic psychopathy in childhood, {{found that}} {{four of the}} 200 {{children}} studied had difficulty with integrating themselves socially. Although their intelligence levels appeared normal, the children lacked nonverbal communication skills, failed to demonstrate empathy with their peers, and were physically clumsy. Their verbal communication was either disjointed or overly formal, and their all-absorbing interest in a single topic dominated their conversations. Asperger named the condition [...] "autistic psychopathy", and described it as primarily marked by social isolation. Asperger described those patients as like [...] "little professors", and believed the individuals he described {{would be capable of}} exceptional achievement and original thought later in life. [...] Asperger's paper defended the value of high-functioning autistic individuals, writing [...] "We are convinced, then, that autistic people have their place in the organism of the social community. They fulfill their role well, perhaps better than anyone else could, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> of people who as children had the greatest difficulties and caused untold worries to their care-givers."
