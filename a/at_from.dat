5|$|Several modern {{commentators}} regard Staunton as {{de facto}} World Champion after his match victory over Saint-Amant, although that title {{did not yet}} formally exist. After Saint-Amant's defeat, no other Frenchmen arose to continue the French supremacy in chess established by Philidor, Deschapelles, La Bourdonnais and Saint-Amant. Some contemporary English commentators, mainly in Staunton's Chess Player's Chronicle, and some later writers hailed Staunton as the world champion.All presented <b>at</b> <b>From</b> Chess Player's Chronicle vol. 5 p. 92 and p. 128.|$|E

5|$|The {{geometric}} {{thickness of}} the ε ring is not precisely known, although the ring is certainly very thin—by some estimates as thin as 150m. Despite such infinitesimal thickness, it consists of several layers of particles. The ε ring is a rather crowded place with a filling factor near the apoapsis estimated by different sources <b>at</b> <b>from</b> 0.008 to 0.06. The mean size of the ring particles is 0.2–20.0m, and the mean separation is around 4.5 times their radius. The ring is almost devoid of dust, possibly due to the aerodynamic drag from Uranus's extended atmospheric corona. Due to its razor-thin nature the ε ring is invisible when viewed edge-on. This happened in 2007 when a ring plane-crossing was observed.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a common}} belief among the Poles that most Jews were Bolsheviks and Communists, in league with the enemy of the Polish state, Soviet Russia. The Polish army stated that any Jews it killed were militants and {{collaborators}} engaged in actions against the Polish army. Having been fired <b>at</b> <b>from</b> Jewish homes, Polish soldiers took this {{as an excuse to}} break into many Jewish homes and stores, beating the Jews and robbing them, desecrating synagogues, arresting hundreds, depriving them of food and drink for days and deporting them from the city; such abuses were, however, not supported by – and even specifically forbidden by – the Polish high command.|$|E
5|$|The ground {{offensive}} in Glina commenced {{with a single}} SAO Krajina soldier tasked with firing on a JNA armoured vehicle from an area close to the police station. This attempted false flag attack was designed to make the vehicle crew believe {{that they were being}} fired on by the Croatian police, inducing them to fire at the police station. The original shooter was observed by the police and shot <b>at</b> <b>from</b> the station, which was in turn fired upon by the JNA. A JNA colonel at the scene then threatened to use force against the Serb rebels unless they left the scene. Following consultations with Vasiljković, the SAO Krajina forces moved on towards Viduševac, where they shot at a number of civilian buildings including a school and a church, before turning to approach the police station from a different direction. The assault, supported by mortar fire, continued until the following day. The police station was captured on 27 July at 11:08. According to SAO Krajina military reports, 27 Croatian military and police personnel were killed in the fighting. Croatian sources reported the deaths of two policemen and the wounding of two others, as well as the deaths of two civilians, including a German journalist killed by sniper fire. The killed journalist, Egon Scotland, a reporter of the Süddeutsche Zeitung, was leaving Glina with a fellow reporter in a clearly marked car, when he was fatally wounded. The same source indicates that the remaining Croatian police officers managed to pull out of Glina to Viduševac.|$|E

25|$|The famine {{stemmed from}} a variety of factors. Economic {{mismanagement}} and the loss of Soviet support caused food production and imports to decline rapidly. A series of floods and droughts exacerbated the crisis. The North Korean government and its centrally planned system proved too inflexible to effectively curtail the disaster. Estimates of the death toll vary widely. Out of a total population of approximately 22 million, somewhere between 240,000 and 3,500,000 North Koreans died from starvation or hunger-related illnesses, with the deaths peaking in 1997. A 2011 U.S. Census Bureau report put the likely number of excess deaths during 1993 to 2000 <b>at</b> <b>from</b> 500,000 to 600,000.|$|E

25|$|On 10 September 1939 {{the policy}} of {{collective}} punishment was introduced, resulting in destruction of villages and towns {{in the path of}} Polish defence lines. In Bogusze and in Lipówka in Suwałki County residents were massacred by the Wehrmacht as soon as the Poles retreated. Some 30 other settlements in the vicinity were burned down in the counties of Bielsk, Wysokie Mazowieckie, Suwałki and Łomża, even though there were not used by the retreating Polish forces. Around Białystok 19 villages were completely destroyed.

His radio was taken from him and his pistol was misplaced during the attack. The Police Association's request for routine carrying of firearms for all officers after this incident was dismissed by the Police Commissioner. The current firearm training and issuing policy has been criticised. Not all police officers receive regular firearm training nor do their vehicles contain a secured firearm. In October 2015, unarmed officers at a routine police checkpoint at Te Atatu South who pursued a vehicle that sped off from the checkpoint were shot <b>at</b> <b>from</b> the offender's vehicle. In December 2015, the Police Association referring to the incident requested that all frontline officers receive firearm training and that their vehicle contain a secured firearm; this was rejected.|$|E
