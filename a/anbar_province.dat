5|$|The United States {{military}} in <b>Anbar</b> <b>Province</b> {{had a series}} of reorganizations in late 2009 and early 2010. The last non-American foreign forces left Iraq on 31 July 2009 and Multi-National Forces West became United States Force– West. On 23 January 2010, the Marines formally left both <b>Anbar</b> <b>Province</b> and Iraq, transferring American military commitments over to the United States Army's 1st Armored Division. The Army promptly merged United States Division West with United States Division– Baghdad, creating United States Division– Center to advise Iraqi forces in both Anbar and Baghdad. In December 2010, the 25th Infantry Division assumed responsibility for <b>Anbar</b> <b>Province.</b> On 7 December, the United States transferred its last base in <b>Anbar</b> <b>Province,</b> Al Asad, to the Iraqi Government. One week later, hundreds of Fallujah residents celebrated the pullout by burning American flags in the city.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Fall of Baghdad, the US Army turned <b>Anbar</b> <b>Province</b> {{over to a}} single regiment, the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR). With only several {{thousand}} soldiers, that force had little hope of effectively controlling Anbar.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013, clashes {{involving}} tribal militias, Iraqi security forces, and the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) {{broke out}} throughout western Iraq. Then, in January 2014, ISIL militants successfully {{took control of}} Fallujah and Ramadi, bringing much of <b>Anbar</b> <b>Province</b> under their control.|$|E
50|$|In December 2006, enough control {{had been}} exerted {{over the city}} to {{transfer}} operational control of the city from American forces to the 1st Iraqi Army Division. During the same month, the Fallujah police force began major offensive operations under their new chief. Coalition Forces, as of May 2007, are operating in direct support of the Iraqi Security Forces in the city. The city is one of <b>Anbar</b> <b>province's</b> centers of gravity in a newfound optimism among American and Iraqi leadership {{about the state of}} the counterinsurgency in the region.|$|R
2500|$|On 5 January 2013, a 53-minute {{video was}} {{released}} on YouTube in which al-Douri encouraged recent Sunni protests in Nineveh and <b>Anbar</b> <b>provinces</b> against Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, saying that [...] "the people of Iraq and all its nationalist and Islamic forces support you until the realization of your just demands for {{the fall of the}} Safavid-Persian alliance." [...] The message, which showed the Ba'athist leader sitting behind a desk with a small Saddam era flag on it, was partially broadcast on the Al Arabiya news channel. In the video, released just before the Iraqi Army Day on 6 January, Douri claimed to be somewhere in Iraq's Babil Province. However, former U.S intelligence officials believe it was filmed in Damascus, Syria. Hours after the tape was released, Iraqi military intelligence arrested Abdul Rahman Mohammed Ibrahim, the nephew of al-Douri, in Saladin Province.|$|R
50|$|Four provinces {{are part}} of the {{semi-autonomous}} region Kurdistan with their Elections in September 2013, two <b>provinces</b> (<b>Anbar,</b> Nineveh) requested to postpone their elections due to security reasons.|$|R
5|$|According to top Marine officials, the {{elections}} {{were designed to}} help enfranchise the Iraqi government by including Iraqi citizens in its formation. Only 3,775 voters (2 percent of the eligible population) cast ballots in <b>Anbar</b> <b>Province</b> due to a Sunni boycott. The simultaneous elections for the provincial council were won by the Iraqi Islamic Party, which suffered from a perceived lack of legitimacy but nevertheless would dominate the Anbar legislature until 2009.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in February 2008, US forces began {{returning}} {{political and}} military control of <b>Anbar</b> <b>Province</b> to Iraqis. On 14 February, 1st Battalion 7th Marines withdrew from Hīt. Two days later, American and Iraqi forces conducted a joint heliborne operation meant {{to show off the}} Iraqi security forces. More significantly, in late March, both Iraqi Army divisions in <b>Anbar</b> <b>Province,</b> the 1st and 7th Divisions, were sent south to participate in the Battle of Basra. Their participation helped win the battle for the government forces and showcased the major improvements to the Iraqi Army. On 26 March 2008, B Squadron of the British SAS as part of Task Force Knight were called upon to hit a terrorist bomb makers house in the early hours, after trying to call him out and receiving no response they stormed the house, they received a hail of fire and four men were wounded and a terrorist from another building joined in the firefight. With Helicopter support, they pressed on and the SAS chased their targets into another house who used civilians as hostages who were then accidentally killed beside the terrorists, One SAS operator was killed.|$|E
5|$|MEF {{commander}} Major General Richard Zilmer {{responded to}} press queries about {{the statement that}} <b>Anbar</b> <b>Province</b> was lost. Zilmer said that he agreed with the assessment, but added that his mission was only to train Iraqi security forces. He added {{that if he were}} asked to achieve a wider objective he would need more forces, but that sending more Americans to Anbar would not pacify the province—that the only path to victory was for the Sunnis to accept the Government of Iraq.|$|E
5000|$|Many criticisms {{leveled at}} the IFHS {{estimate}} have originated from {{authors of the}} Lancet survey or others associated with that survey. Some of these criticisms relate to an idea that respondents would have a fear of giving information about violence-related deaths to government interviewers who represented [...] "one side of the conflict" [...] and the reliance on Iraq Body Count's data in dangerous areas (<b>Anbar</b> and Nineveh <b>provinces</b> and parts of Baghdad).|$|R
50|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the 20 April provincial elections, the first since the {{withdrawal}} of US forces in 2011, tensions were high in Iraq as Sunni groups claimed they were being marginalized by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's Shiite dominated government. A number of large scale attacks linked to the Sunni umbrella group Islamic State of Iraq were carried out in early 2013 in an attempt to destabilize the country ahead of the elections. At least fourteen election candidates were murdered, while <b>Anbar</b> and Nineveh <b>provinces</b> postponed elections because of security concerns. Four other provinces did not hold elections on 20 April.|$|R
500|$|In May, the 13th MEU {{moved into}} Tharthar, a [...] {{area that was}} AQI's last Anbar refuge. Their goal was to cut off insurgent travel between <b>Anbar</b> and Salahuddin <b>Provinces</b> into Baghdad and to uncover weapons caches. Resistance was light and many insurgents fled. The insurgents laid over 400 mines to slow the Marines down. In one operation, Marines found 18 tons of {{homemade}} explosives and [...] of ammonium nitrate fertilizer. They uncovered several mass graves, containing a total of over 100 victims left behind by AQI. Tharthar was cleared by August. Operation Alljah {{was one of the}} last significant Anbar offensives. By late October, weeks passed without casualties.|$|R
5|$|Violence {{continued}} through {{the last months of}} 2011. In September, a bus carrying Shia pilgrims from neighboring Karbala Governorate was stopped outside of Ramadi and 22 were executed, prompting threats from Karbala to annex parts of southern <b>Anbar</b> <b>Province,</b> including the city of Nukhayb. In November, the provincial council in Anbar announced that it was considering whether to form a semi-autonomous region with other provinces in the Sunni areas of Iraq.|$|E
5|$|AQI {{launched}} {{a series of}} attacks in Jordan in late 2005 that were partially based out of Anbar. The group had already unsuccessfully attacked the Trebil checkpoint along the Jordanian border with <b>Anbar</b> <b>Province</b> in December 2004. In August, two US warships in Aqaba, the USS Kearsarge and the USS Ashland, were attacked with rockets; the cell which carried out the attacks then fled into Iraq. On 9 November, three Iraqis from Anbar carried out suicide bombings in Amman, killing 60. A fourth bomber, also from Anbar, was caught.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine gas {{was also}} used during the Iraq War in <b>Anbar</b> <b>Province</b> in 2007, with insurgents packing truck bombs with mortar shells and {{chlorine}} tanks. The attacks killed two people from the explosives and sickened more than 350. Most of the deaths were caused {{by the force of}} the explosions rather than the effects of chlorine since the toxic gas is readily dispersed and diluted in the atmosphere by the blast. In some bombings, over a hundred civilians were hospitalized due to breathing difficulties. The Iraqi authorities tightened security for elemental chlorine, which is essential for providing safe drinking water to the population.|$|E
50|$|On 14 August, it was {{announced}} that the operation ended. Coalition and Iraqi security forces pushed into areas previously not under their control, and they also ejected insurgent groups from their strongholds in Northern Babil, eastern <b>Anbar</b> and Diyala <b>provinces</b> and on the southern outskirts of Baghdad. During the operation, Iraqi and Coalition forces conducted intelligence raids against al Qaeda in Iraq and the Iranian-backed cells nationwide, with a heavy emphasis on cells in Baghdad, Diyala, and central and northern Iraq. Operation Arrowhead Ripper continued for another five days until 19 August with more intense street fighting in Baquba. The operations continued into operation Phantom Strike.|$|R

50|$|In May, the 13th MEU {{moved into}} Tharthar, a 970 sq mi {{area that was}} AQI's last Anbar refuge. Their goal was to cut off insurgent travel between <b>Anbar</b> and Salahuddin <b>Provinces</b> into Baghdad and to uncover weapons caches. Resistance was light and many insurgents fled. The insurgents laid over 400 mines to slow the Marines down. In one operation, Marines found 18 tons of {{homemade}} explosives and 48000 lb of ammonium nitrate fertilizer. They uncovered several mass graves, containing a total of over 100 victims left behind by AQI. Tharthar was cleared by August. Operation Alljah {{was one of the}} last significant Anbar offensives. By late October, weeks passed without casualties.|$|R
5|$|The Iraq War in <b>Anbar</b> <b>Province,</b> {{also known}} as the Al Anbar campaign, {{consisted}} of fighting between the United States military, together with Iraqi Government forces, and Sunni insurgents in the western Iraqi province of Al Anbar. The Iraq War lasted from 2003 to 2011, but the majority of the fighting and counterinsurgency campaign in Anbar took place between April 2004 and September 2007. Although the fighting initially featured heavy urban warfare primarily between insurgents and U.S. Marines, insurgents in later years focused on ambushing the American and Iraqi security forces with improvised explosive devices (IED's), large scale attacks on combat outposts, and car bombings. Almost 9,000 Iraqis and 1,335 Americans were killed in the campaign, many in the Euphrates River Valley and the Sunni Triangle around the cities of Fallujah and Ramadi.|$|E
5|$|The {{last major}} {{military}} action in <b>Anbar</b> <b>Province</b> occurred on 26 October 2008, {{when a group of}} Army Special Forces conducted a raid into Syria to kill Abu Ghadiya, the leader of a network of foreign fighters who were traveling through Syria. Anbar continued to play a large role in the Iraqi insurgency. That same month AQI announced the formation of the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), an umbrella group led by Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, a cleric from Anbar. After both Al-Baghdadi and Al-Masri were killed in Tikrit in April 2010, the US believed the new leader of AQI/ISI was Abu Dua al-Badri, a former Emir of Rawa who was married to a woman from Fallujah.|$|E
5|$|In August 2006, several tribes {{located in}} Ramadi {{and led by}} Sheikh Abdul Sattar Abu Risha began to form what would {{eventually}} become the Anbar Awakening, which later led to the tribes revolting against AQI. The Anbar Awakening helped turn the tide against the insurgents through 2007. American and Iraqi tribal forces regained control of Ramadi in early 2007, {{as well as other}} cities such as Hīt, Haditha, and Rutbah. More hard fighting still followed throughout the Summer of 2007 however, particularly in the rural western River Valley, due largely to its proximity to the Syrian border and the vast network of natural entry points for foreign fighters to enter Iraq, via Syria. In June 2007 the U.S. turned a majority of its attention to eastern <b>Anbar</b> <b>Province</b> and secured the cities of Fallujah and Al-Karmah.|$|E
50|$|In recent months, American and Iraqi {{forces have}} struck {{powerful}} blows against al Qaeda terrorists and violent extremists in <b>Anbar</b> and other <b>provinces.</b> In recent days, our troops and Iraqi allies {{launched a new}} offensive called Phantom Strike. In this offensive, we are carrying out targeted operations against terrorists and extremists fleeing Baghdad and other key cities -- {{to prevent them from}} returning or setting up new bases of operation. The terrorists remain dangerous and brutal, as we saw this week when they massacred more than 200 innocent Yezidis, a small religious minority in northwestern Iraq. Our hearts go out to the families of those killed, and our troops are going to go after the murderers behind this horrific attack.|$|R
50|$|In Operation Phantom Phoenix, over January-July 2008, the multi-national {{force in}} Iraq {{attempted}} {{to hunt down}} the last 200 Al-Qaeda extremists in the eastern Diyala Governorate, which resulted in 900 ‘insurgents’ being killed and 2,500 captured, and 59 US, 776 Iraqi, three Georgian and one UK soldiers killed. By May 2008, according to Newsweek, US and Iraqi military offensives had driven AQI from Al <b>Anbar</b> and Diyala <b>Provinces,</b> leaving AQI holed up {{in and around the}} northern city of Mosul.The effect of the US troop surge between June 2007 and January 2009, together with American-funding of Sunni groups fighting AQI (see section 2007 US arming militias against AQI), was—according to The Washington Post—the killing or detention of ‘scores of AQI leaders’.|$|R
50|$|The {{training}} camp, {{located in}} a remote region near Lake Tharthar, which is next to the Sunni <b>Anbar</b> and Salahuddin <b>provinces,</b> was the largest guerrilla training camp that had been discovered in the war by then, according to Iraqi officials. The camp was shared by Ba’ath party loyalists and members of Al-Qaeda. The insurgents had planned to attack the city of Samarra, which was located some 55 kilometers east of the lake, {{with a large number}} of car bombs. No insurgents were captured alive or dead. The remote site contained ramshackle huts and tents, along with boats used by insurgents to cross the lake. The camp was well defended with guard towers, bunkers and barbed wire. There was an estimated 120 insurgents in the camp at the time.|$|R
25|$|The {{division}} {{returned to}} Iraq in February 2004 and {{took control of}} the Al <b>Anbar</b> <b>province</b> in western Iraq; it was the lead unit in Operation Vigilant Resolve and Operation Phantom Fury in 2004. During February and March 2005, the division was relieved by the 2nd Marine Division concluding the largest relief in place {{in the history of the}} Marine Corps. In 2006, the division again deployed to Iraq as the ground combat element for I MEF in the Al <b>Anbar</b> <b>province.</b> It returned to MCB Camp Pendleton in early 2007.|$|E
25|$|The 2nd Marine Regiment {{deployed}} to Iraq in January 2005 {{as part of}} the 2nd Marine Division in the Al <b>Anbar</b> <b>Province</b> in western Iraq and returned home in March 2006.|$|E
25|$|On July 29, 2006, Baucus's nephew Marine Cpl. Phillip E. Baucus {{was killed}} in combat in Al <b>Anbar</b> <b>Province.</b> Phillip, a 28-year-old {{resident}} of Wolf Creek, Montana, {{had been a member}} of the 3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, 1st Marine Division, I Marine Expeditionary Force.|$|E
40|$|Although {{there have}} been several {{attempts}} to tabulate civilian casualties in the Iraq War, the effect of these casualties on the Iraqi population and insurgent organizations has not been thoroughly examined. From the literature of the motives and mechanisms behind the formation and expansion of insurgencies, as well as the culture and values of Iraqi society, it is expected that increased civilian casualties will create grievance among the population, causing support for insurgents and increased attacks on coalition forces. This paper statistically analyzes data on Iraqi civilian and coalition force casualties to determine if there is a causal relationship between the two variables. It also recognizes the limitations and potential biases of the available data. Control variables are included in the statistical analysis to compare the influence of civilian casualties to competing theories of insurgency formation. Analysis demonstrates that while civilian casualties and coalition casualties have a positive relationship, significant causality between the two variables cannot be established. Alternative hypotheses examine unique factors in <b>Anbar</b> and Baghdad <b>provinces</b> and the role of focus events in insurgent activity. The paper concludes with recommendations for further study. by Jessica Eve Karnis. Thesis (S. M. and S. B.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Political Science, 2006.

40|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{published}} molecular information concerning plant viruses from Iraq, this study was initiated to investigate the diversity of viruses infecting potato and vegetables in Iraq on a molecular basis. Based on the economic importance and incidence worldwide, eight virus genera were investigated in 175 potato and vegetable samples collected from fields in Baghdad, <b>Anbar</b> and Najaf <b>provinces</b> in Iraq. Using genus/family specific primers, published in the literature, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were performed to screen samples for potyviruses, begomoviruses, carlaviruses, tombusviruses, potexviruses, cucumoviruses, tobamoviruses and alfamoviruses. Circular DNA viruses were screened by rolling circle amplification (RCA). Products resulting from PCR/RT-PCR and RCA were cloned and sequenced and data obtained were used for sequence analyses. The above approach led to the first molecular characterisation of three potyviruses; Potato virus Y (PVY), Bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) and Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV), one begomovirus; Tomato yellow leaf curl virus, two carlaviruses, Potato virus S (PVS) and Cowpea mild mottle virus (CPMMV) and one tombusvirus; Grapevine Algerian latent virus (GALV) in Iraqi potato and vegetable samples. Based on nucleotide (nt) sequence analyses, BYMV from broad bean and ZYMV from zucchini were 97 % and 99 % identical to equivalent sequences from the GenBank sequences, respectively. Two PVY strains were distinguished when sequences from potato and tomato showed 99 % maximum nt identity to equivalent PVYO: N and PVYNTN GenBank sequences, respectively. Full-length sequence from tomato amplified by RCA showed 99 % maximum nt identity to equivalent TYLCV sequences from the GenBank. Sequence comparison of carlavirus sequences isolated from potato and cowpea were 99 % and 96 % identical to equivalents PVS and CPMMV sequences from the GenBank, respectively. All tombusvirus sequences amplified from tomato and eggplant showed 93 % maximum nt identity to equivalent GALV GenBank sequences. The high similarities (93 - 99 %) of virus sequences isolated suggest, viruses isolated may have been introduced into Iraq from other countries, through international trading of plant materials used for cultivation as Iraq import most of plant materials for agriculture...|$|R
25|$|The Free Iraqi Army, {{created to}} emulate the FSA, {{soldiers}} and supplies crossed from <b>Anbar</b> <b>Province</b> into Syria. Sunni armed groups inside in the western Sunni-majority provinces of Iraq formed the Free Iraqi Army and have been supportive of the Syrian uprising against the Syrian government.|$|E
25|$|Caravan with wing hardpoints. An ISTAR version {{built by}} ATK armed with Hellfire {{missiles}} {{is used by}} the Iraqi air force. The AC-208 received its combat debut in January 2014 when the Iraqi Air Force began employing it against insurgents in <b>Anbar</b> <b>province.</b> One aircraft crashed in March 2016.|$|E
25|$|On April 15, 2014 the Iraqi Justice Ministry {{announced}} that it had closed the prison amid fear {{that it could be}} taken over by Sunni insurgents that control much of <b>Anbar</b> <b>Province.</b> All 2,400 inmates were moved to other high-security facilities in the country. It was not made clear if the closure is temporary or permanent.|$|E
25|$|Since December 2013, ongoing clashes have {{occurred}} throughout western Iraq between tribal militias, Iraqi security forces, and ISIL. In early January 2014, ISIL militants successfully captured {{the cities of}} Fallujah and Hīt, bringing much of <b>Anbar</b> <b>Province</b> under their control. In June 2014 ISIL took over the Iraqi city of Mosul. By December 2015, the Islamic State covered a vast landlocked territory in western Iraq and eastern Syria, with a population estimate of 2.8 to 8 million people.|$|E
25|$|Individual battalions of the 2nd Marines {{have participated}} in {{stability}} and security operations in Iraq and Afghanistan on a seven-month rotating basis. The most notable actions in Iraq occurred in the Sunni stronghold of Al <b>Anbar</b> <b>province</b> during the battles for Fallujah during which the 2nd Battalion 2nd Marines {{was attached to the}} 1st Marine Regiment in 2004 to participate in Operation Vigilant Resolve and Operation Phantom Fury. These intense urban fights were reminiscent of the house-to-house fighting required during the Battle of Seoul during the Korean War in 1950 and the Battle of Hue.|$|E
25|$|The Iraq War troop {{surge of}} 2007 {{supplied}} the US military with more manpower for operations, {{and dozens of}} high-level AQI members being captured or killed. Between July and October 2007, al-Qaeda in Iraq {{was reported to have}} lost its secure military bases in Al <b>Anbar</b> <b>province</b> and the Baghdad area. During 2008, a series of US and Iraqi offensives managed to drive out AQI-aligned insurgents from their former safe havens, such as the Diyala and Al Anbar governorates, to the area of the northern city of Mosul.|$|E
25|$|On March 13, {{a senior}} Iraqi general {{reported}} that ISIL has fully {{withdrawn from the}} city of Ar-Rutbah to Al-Qa'im, after they began leaving the night before. The withdrawal was confirmed by a member of Anbar's security council. It was also reported that ISIL had abandoned the town of Kabisa as well, and they had also withdrawn from Hīt to some degree, with Iraqi warplanes bombing the retreating militants. This {{was the first time that}} ISIL has withdrawn from a major urban area without an actual fight, and the retreat came after recent losses on the battlefield for ISIL in Syria and in the <b>Anbar</b> <b>Province,</b> including a recent offensive on Hīt. However, ISIL returned to the town on the following day.|$|E
