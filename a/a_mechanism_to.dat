5|$|In a paper {{published}} in Nature in January 2013, {{scientists from the}} European Bioinformatics Institute and Agilent Technologies proposed <b>a</b> <b>mechanism</b> <b>to</b> use DNA's ability to code information {{as a means of}} digital data storage. The group was able to encode 739 kilobytes of data into DNA code, synthesize the actual DNA, then sequence the DNA and decode the information back to its original form, with a reported 100% accuracy. The encoded information consisted of text files and audio files. A prior experiment was {{published in}} August 2012. It was conducted by researchers at Harvard University, where the text of a 54,000-word book was encoded in DNA.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to {{research}} conducted by the Musée suisse de l'appareil photographique at Vevey, much more {{is known about the}} pigeon cameras developed {{at about the same time}} by the Swiss clockmaker Christian Adrian Michel (1912–1980) in Walde. He was assigned to the Swiss Army's carrier pigeons service in 1931, and in 1933 he began work on adapting Neubronner's panoramic camera to 16mm film, and improving it with <b>a</b> <b>mechanism</b> <b>to</b> control the delay before the first exposure and to transport the film between exposures. Michel's camera, patented in 1937, weighed only , and may have been one of the first to have a timer operated by clockwork.|$|E
5|$|The {{transition}} from an aquatic, lobe-finned fish to an air-breathing amphibian {{was a significant}} and fundamental one in the evolutionary history of the vertebrates. For an organism {{to live in a}} gravity-neutral aqueous environment, then colonize one that requires an organism to support its entire weight and possess <b>a</b> <b>mechanism</b> <b>to</b> mitigate dehydration, required significant adaptations or exaptations within the overall body plan, both in form and in function. Eryops, an example of an animal that made such adaptations, refined many of the traits found in its fish ancestors. Sturdy limbs supported and transported its body while out of water. A thicker, stronger backbone prevented its body from sagging under its own weight. Also, through the reshaping of vestigial fish jaw bones, a rudimentary middle ear began developing to connect to the piscine inner ear, allowing Eryops to amplify, and so better sense, airborne sound.|$|E

25|$|The {{decentralization}} process remained very slow.
