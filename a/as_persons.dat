5|$|The empire's {{population}} was classified into white people, {{also referred to}} as Europeans, and non-white people, variously referred to <b>as</b> <b>persons</b> of colour, negros and natives. The largest ethnic grouping in the empire was Indians (including what are now Pakistanis and Bangladeshis), who were classified into a number of individual South Asian ethnic groups. The following table gives the population figures for white people and non-white, in the empire and its territories, in 1814 and 1901.|$|E
5|$|In a Hindu {{caste system}} that was conspicuously present, Brahmins enjoyed a privileged {{position}} as providers of knowledge and local justice. These Brahmins were normally involved in careers that revolved around religion and learning {{with the exception of}} a few who achieved success in martial affairs. They were patronised by kings, nobles and wealthy aristocrats who persuaded learned Brahmins to settle in specific towns and villages by making them grants of land and houses. The relocation of Brahmin scholars was calculated to be in the interest of the kingdom as they were viewed <b>as</b> <b>persons</b> detached from wealth and power and their knowledge was a useful tool to educate and teach ethical conduct and discipline in local communities. Brahmins were also actively involved in solving local problems by functioning as neutral arbiters (Panchayat).|$|E

In early decision, 620 out of 3,520 applicants were admitted, for an acceptance rate of 17.61%. In regular decision, 1,573 out of 32,772 applicants were admitted, for an acceptance rate of 4.79%. For the Class of 2021, 2,185 out of 37,389 applicants were admitted for an overall acceptance rate of 5.8%, making Columbia {{the third most}} selective college in the United States behind Stanford and Harvard and the 2nd most selective college in the Ivy League. According to the 2012 college selectivity ranking by U.S. News & World Report, which factors admission and yield rates among other criteria, Columbia was tied with Yale, Caltech and MIT as the most selective colleges in the country. Columbia is a racially diverse school, with approximately 52% of all students identifying themselves <b>as</b> <b>persons</b> of color. Additionally, 50% of all undergraduates received grants from Columbia. The average grant size awarded to these students is $46,516.

The status of non-human primates has generated much debate, particularly through the Great Ape Project (GAP), which argues that great apes (gorillas, orangutans, chimpanzees, bonobos) should be given limited legal status {{and the protection of}} three basic interests: the right to live, the protection of individual liberty, and the prohibition of torture.|$|E

25|$|Various animistic {{cultures}} also comprehend as stones <b>as</b> <b>persons.</b> Discussing ethnographic work conducted {{among the}} Ojibwe, Harvey noted that their society generally conceived of stones as being inanimate, but with two notable exceptions: {{the stones of}} the Bell Rocks and those stones which are situated beneath trees struck by lightning, which were understood to have become Thunderers themselves. The Ojibwe conceived of weather as being capable of having personhood, with storms being conceived of <b>as</b> <b>persons</b> known as 'Thunderers' whose sounds conveyed communications and who engaged in seasonal conflict over the lakes and forests, throwing lightning at lake monsters. Wind, similarly, can be conceived as a person in animistic thought.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the issue of}} depersonalization and the subjective need for objectification and provides a means of understanding and developing a possible solution. Through the basic observation of an overlap between Behavioral Genetics, Neuroscience, Philosophy, Psychology, Physiognomy, the visual language and the artistic practice, one can begin {{to take note of}} the affects of our environments on an individualistic level. Through creative practice {{and the use of the}} visual language, one may develop an individualistic form of therapy. In recent years we have drifted away from the science of visual language and the basic aesthetic experience. The visual language and the basic aesthetic experience allow the depersonalized individual to engage in conversation and observation through an object of the visual language to the biological inner self <b>as</b> <b>person.</b> Through this conversation one may find comfort in the acknowledgment of the biological inner self <b>as</b> <b>person</b> from the other <b>as</b> <b>person</b> in hopes to subdue the subjective need for objectification. One may also gain a better understanding of the individualistic correlation between one 2 ̆ 7 s environment and one 2 ̆ 7 s biological inner self <b>as</b> <b>person...</b>|$|R

25|$|In the United States {{since its}} early history, Native Americans, Africans and Europeans were {{considered}} to belong to different races. For nearly three centuries, the criteria for membership in these groups were similar, comprising a person's appearance, their social circle (how they lived), and their known non-White ancestry. History played a part, <b>as</b> <b>persons</b> with known slave ancestors were assumed to be African (or, in later usage, black), {{regardless of whether they}} also had European ancestry.|$|E
