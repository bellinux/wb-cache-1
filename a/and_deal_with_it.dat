2500|$|Scorsese and Pileggi {{collaborated on}} the screenplay, {{and over the}} course of the 12 drafts it took to reach the ideal script, the {{reporter}} realized [...] "the visual styling had to be completely redone... So we decided to share credit". They decided which sections of the book they liked and put them together like building blocks. Scorsese persuaded Pileggi that they did not need to follow a traditional narrative structure. The director wanted to take the gangster film <b>and</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> episode by episode, but start in the middle and move backwards and forwards. Scorsese would compact scenes and realized that if they were kept short, [...] "the impact after about an hour and a half would be terrific". He wanted to do the voiceover like the opening of Jules and Jim (1962) and use [...] "all the basic tricks of the New Wave from around 1961". The names of several real-life gangsters were altered for the film: Tommy [...] "Two Gun" [...] DeSimone became the character Tommy DeVito; Paul Vario became Paulie Cicero, and Jimmy [...] "The Gent" [...] Burke was portrayed as Jimmy Conway. Pileggi and Scorsese decided to change the title of their film to Goodfellas because two contemporary projects, the 1986 Brian De Palma film Wise Guys and the 1987–1990 TV series Wiseguy had used similar titles.|$|E

For {{you need}} not think {{that even if you}} {{obtained}} a majority of representatives in the existing parliament, you could immediately compel any system of business, broadly contrary to that now established by custom.

Be assured that no great change for the better can ever be easily accomplished, or quickly; nor by impulsive, ill-regulated effort, nor by bad men; nor even by good men, without much suffering. The suffering must, indeed, come, one way or another, in all greatly critical periods; the only question, for us, is whether we will reach our ends (if we ever reach them) through a chain of involuntary miseries, many of them useless, and all ignoble; or whether we will know the worst at once, <b>and</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> by the wisely sharp methods of Godsped courage.|$|E
60|$|He {{began to}} reform the {{marriage}} laws. He did his utmost not to think especially of Lady Harman and himself while he was doing so. He would just take up the whole question <b>and</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> in a temperate reasonable way. It was so necessary to be reasonable and temperate in these questions--and {{not to think of}} death as a solution. Marriages to begin with were too easy to make and too difficult to break; countless girls--Lady Harman was only a type--were married long before they could know the beginnings of their own minds. We wanted to delay marriage--until the middle twenties, say. Why not? Or if by the infirmities of humanity one must have marriage before then, there ought to be some especial opportunity of rescinding it later. (Lady Harman ought {{to have been able to}} rescind her marriage.) What ought to be the marriageable age in a civilized community? When the mind was settled into its general system of opinions Mr. Brumley thought, and then lapsed into a speculation whether the mind didn't keep changing and developing all through life; Lady Harman's was certainly still doing so.... This pointed to logical consequences of an undesirable sort....|$|E
6000|$|Victoria was silent, the {{recollection}} of the talk between Mr. Tooting and Mr. Crewe running through her mind, and Mr. Tooting's {{saying that he had}} done [...] "dirty things" [...] for the Northeastern. She felt that this was something she could not tell her father, nor could she answer his argument with what Tom Gaylord had said. She could not, indeed, answer Mr. Flint's argument at all; the subject, as he had declared, being too vast for her. And moreover, as she well knew, Mr. Flint was a man whom other men could not easily answer; he bore them down, even as he had borne her down. Involuntarily her mind turned to Austen, and she wondered what he had said; she wondered how he would have answered her father--whether he could have answered him. And she knew not what to think. Could it be right, in a position of power and responsibility, to acknowledge evil <b>and</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> as evil? That was, in effect, the gist of Mr. Flint's contention. She did not know. She had never (strangely enough, she thought) sought before to analyze the ethical side of her father's character. One aspect of him she had shared with her mother, that he was a tower of defence and strength, and that his name alone had often been sufficient to get difficult things done.|$|E

60|$|I {{have been}} led to see and feel this more and more, as I {{consider}} the service which the flowers and trees, which man was at first appointed to keep, were intended to render to him in return for his care; and the services they still render to him, {{as far as he}} allows their influence, or fulfils his own task towards them. For what infinite wonderfulness there is in this vegetation, considered, as indeed it is, as the means by which the earth becomes the companion of man--his friend and his teacher! In the conditions which we have traced in its rocks, there could only be seen preparation for his existence;--the characters which enable him to live on it safely, and to work with it easily--in all these it has been inanimate and passive; but vegetation is to it as an imperfect soul, given to meet the soul of man. The earth in its depths must remain dead and cold, incapable except of slow crystalline change; but at its surface, which human beings look upon <b>and</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with,</b> <b>it</b> ministers to them through a veil of strange intermediate being: which breathes, but has no voice; moves, but cannot leave its appointed place; passes through life without consciousness, to death without bitterness; wears the beauty of youth, without its passion; and declines to the weakness of age, without its regret.|$|E
60|$|The {{intellectual}} {{trouble in}} the matter, as it presents itself to me, comes in upon this, that the question does not lie in one plane. So many discussions ignore this fact, <b>and</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> on one plane only. For example, we may take the whole business on {{the plane of the}} medical man, ignoring all other considerations. On that plane it would probably be almost easy to reason out a working system. It never has been done by the medical profession, as a whole, which is fairly understandable, or by any group of medical men, which is the more surprising, but it would be an extremely interesting thing to have done and a material contribution to the sane discussion of this problem. It would not solve it but it would illuminate certain aspects. Let the mere physiological problem be taken. We want healthy children and the best we can get. Let the medical man devise his scheme primarily for that. Understand we are shutting our eyes to every other consideration but physical or quasi- physical ones. Imagine the thing done, for example, by a Mr. Francis Galton, who had an absolutely open mind upon all other questions. Some form of polygamy, marriage of the most transient description, with reproduction barred to specified types, would probably come from such a speculation. But, in addition, {{a number of people who}} can have only a few children or none are, nevertheless, not adapted physiologically for celibacy. Conceive the medical man working that problem out upon purely materialistic lines and with an eye to all physiological and pathological peculiarities. The Tasmanians (now extinct) seem to have been somewhere near the probable result.|$|E
60|$|Now, Deville's process {{depends upon}} three points,--upon intense heat, {{blowpipe}} action, and {{the volatility of}} certain metals. We {{know that there are}} plenty of metals that are volatile; but this, I think, {{is the first time that}} it has been proposed to use the volatility of certain metals--such as gold and palladium--for the purpose of driving them off and leaving something else behind. He counts largely upon the volatility of metals which we have not been in the habit of considering volatile, but which we have rather looked upon as fixed; and I must endeavour to illustrate these three points by a few experiments. Perhaps I can best show you what is required in the process of heating platinum by using that source of heat which we have here, and which seems to be almost illimitable--namely, the voltaic battery; for it is only in consequence of the heat that the voltaic battery affects the platinum. By applying the two extremities of the battery to this piece of platinum-wire, you will see what result we shall obtain. You perceive that we can take about this heating agent wherever we like, <b>and</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> as we please, limiting it in any way. I am obliged to deal carefully with it; but even that circumstance will have an interest for you in watching the experiment. Contact is now made. The electric current, when compressed into thin conducting-wires offering resistance, evolves heat to a large extent; and this is the power by which we work. You see the intense glow immediately imparted to the wire; and if I applied the heat continuously, the effect of the current would be to melt the wire. As soon as the contact is broken, the wire resumes its former appearance; and now that we make contact again, you perceive the glow as before. [The experiment was repeated several times in rapid succession.] You can see a line of light, though you can scarcely perceive the wire; and now that it has melted with the great heat, if you examine it, you will perceive that it is indeed a set of irregularities from end to end--a set of little spheres, which are strung upon an axis of platinum running through it. It is that wire which Mr. Grove described as being produced at the moment when fusion of the whole mass is commencing. In the same manner, if I take a tolerably thick piece of platinum, and subject it to the heat that can be produced by this battery, you will see the brilliancy of the effect produced. I shall put on a pair of spectacles for the experiment, as there is an injurious effect of the voltaic spark upon the eyes, if the action is continued; and it is neither policy nor bravery to subject any organ to unnecessary danger; and I want, at all events, to keep the full use of my eyes to the end of the lecture.|$|E
