50|$|Aeroplankton (or <b>aerial</b> <b>plankton)</b> {{are tiny}} lifeforms that float and drift in the air, {{carried by the}} current of the wind; they are the {{atmospheric}} analogue to oceanic plankton.|$|E
50|$|Ephemera danica {{can reach}} an imago size of 15 - 20 mm in males, while females are larger, {{reaching}} 16 - 25 mm. This mayfly, with its characteristic markings and three tails (Cerci), {{is the most}} commonly seen of British Ephemeridae. Imago wings are translucent with dark veining, while in subimago they are dull and yellowish with brown veins. Moreover forelegs and the tails of the spinners are very much longer than in duns. Mouthparts are non-functional, as adults do not feed. These insects {{are part of the}} <b>aerial</b> <b>plankton</b> and usually they are food for swallows, trouts and many amphibians and spiders.|$|E
40|$|Orb-weaving spiders (Araneidae) are {{commonly}} regarded as generalist insect predators but resources provided by {{plants such as}} pollen {{may be an important}} dietary supplementation. Their webs snare insect prey, but can also trap <b>aerial</b> <b>plankton</b> like pollen and fungal spores. When recycling their orb webs, the spiders may therefore also feed on adhering pollen grains or fungal spores via extraoral digestion. In this study we measured stable isotope ratios in the bodies of two araneid species (Aculepeira ceropegia and Araneus diadematus), their potential prey and pollen to determine the relative contribution of pollen to their diet. We found that about 25 % of juvenile orb-weaving spiders' diet consisted of pollen, the other 75 % of flying insects, mainly small dipterans and hymenopterans. The pollen grains in our study were too large to be taken up accidentally by the spiders and had first to be digested extraorally by enzymes in an active act of consumption. Therefore, pollen {{can be seen as a}} substantial component of the spiders' diet. This finding suggests that these spiders need to be classified as omnivores rather than pure carnivores...|$|E
40|$|The California fishery for Pacific {{mackerel}} (Scomber japonicus) {{has declined}} precipitously since 1990. Statewide landings during 1995 continued the downward trend, and totaled only 9, 185 short tons. During {{the last few}} years, the principal cause of reduced catches has been low biomass and poor availability on the traditional fishing grounds in southern California waters. Cannery closures since 1993 may have also affected demand. Several sources of information {{are available on the}} status of the Pacific mackerel stock, all of which suggest a decline in stock biomass compared to the late 1970 's and 1980 's. Landing statistics, available since 1978 for both the U. S. and Mexican fisheries, show reduced catches during recent years. Catch rates for the southern California Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel (CPFV) fleet have also shown declining trends since the 1970 's. Other fishery- independent data from spotter pilot aerial observations and California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) ichthyoplankton surveys indicate lower abundance compared to the early 1980 's. We used a tuned virtual population analysis (VPA) model called ADEPT to estimate Pacific mackerel biomass. The model finds the best statistical fit between fishery-based, age-structured biomass estimates and other data from <b>aerial</b> observations, <b>plankton</b> surveys, CPFV catch data, and a spawner-recruit relation. Based on the estimated number of fish in each year class during the last quarter of 1995 (including the 1995 year class), and using certain assumptions for expected fishing mortality {{during the first half of}} 1996, we project that the Pacific mackerel biomass will be 52, 000 tons at the beginning of the 1996 / 97 fishing season, on July 1, 1996. There is a large degree of uncertainty in our 1996 biomass estimate because the 1995 year class (fish of age one) comprises most of the biomass. The Fish and Game Code specifies that when the biomass is between 20, 000 and 150, 000 tons, the season's quota shall be 30 percent of the total biomass in excess of 20, 000 tons. Using that formula and our projection for July 1, 1996, we recommend a commercial fishery quota of 9, 600 tons for the 1996 / 97 fishing season. (26 pp. ...|$|R
40|$|The California fishery for Pacific mackerel, Scomber japonicus, has {{declined}} precipitously since 1990, and statewide landings during 1994 totaled only 11, 070 short tons. The principal {{cause of the}} low catches has been low biomass and poor availability on the traditional fishing grounds in southern California waters. Several sources of information {{are available on the}} status of the Pacific mackerel stock. Landing statistics were available since 1978 for both the U. S. and Mexican fisheries, and both fisheries show similar declines during recent years. Other fishery-independent data from <b>aerial</b> observations and <b>plankton</b> surveys (mackerel larvae samples) also show declines in abundance compared to the early 1980 's. We used a tuned virtual population analysis (VPA) model called ADEPT to estimate Pacific mackerel abundance. The model finds the best statistical fit between fishery-based age-structured biomass estimates and other data from the aerial observations and the plankton surveys. A model-derived biomass estimate for July 1, 1994 was 71, 000 tons. Based on the estimated number of fish in each year class at the end of 1994, and using certain assumptions concerning expected fishing mortality {{during the first half of}} 1995, we project that the Pacific mackerel biomass will be 56, 000 tons at the beginning of the 1995 / 96 fishing season, on July 1, 1995. The Fish and Game Code specifies that when the biomass is between 20, 000 and 150, 000 tons, the season's quota shall be 30 percent of the biomass in excess of 20, 000 tons. Using that formula and our projection for July 1, 1995, the commercial fishery quota for the 1995 / 96 fishing season is 10, 800 tons. (21 pp. ...|$|R
40|$|In 1984 - 5 the carabids and staphylinids on ten {{isolated}} limestone outcrops and intervening {{blanket peat}} within the Moor House Reserve, Cumbria, were investigated. In 1986 a subsidiary study on similar habitats {{was made at}} Tailbridge Hill, Cumbria. Pitfall and window traps sampled beetles {{from the ground and}} air respectively. Numbers and alpha diversities of carabids and staphylinids were higher on the Moor House limestone outcrops than on the blanket peat. The outcrops acted as isolates to many species, but also suffered considerable contamination by adjacent peat faunas. Limestone species taken on outcrops exhibited a positive species: area relationship consistent with island biogeographical theory. Peat species taken on outcrops showed a negative species: area relationship. Overall, species of staphylinid were positively, and carabid, negatively, correlated with outcrop size. Dispersal of species between habitats was influenced by body size, degree of hygrophily and flight activity. Flight by carabids was negligible, but most staphylinids could fly. Weather conditions were probably the primary cause of this difference between taxa. Flight by staphylinids was related to the stability of the habitat or resources involved. All Nomadic species could fly whereas flight by Peat species was negligible. Limestone species showed relatively high levels of flight activity attributable to the need of many rarer species for regular dispersal between outcrops to spread the risk of extinction. The aerial fauna at Moor House had three components, with species deriving from the immediate habitat, moorland habitats nearby, or regions beyond the Reserve. A considerable influx of staphylinids (and aphids) onto the Reserve occurred in July-October as <b>aerial</b> <b>plankton</b> was carried in from the west by prevailing winds. The applicability of island biogeography theory to the Moor House system, and to 'habitat islands' in general, is discussed...|$|E
