25|$|On October 15, 2015, Runway 10R/28L was commissioned. The new 7,500-foot runway {{will be used}} almost {{exclusively}} for landings toward the east up until 10 p.m. daily.

However, the runway sits on the southernmost part of the airfield which aligns roughly with Irving Park Road in Bensenville. Since the runway is several miles from the passenger terminals, the average taxi time is estimated at about 20 minutes.

500|$|Increasing {{temperatures}} tend {{to increase}} evaporation {{which leads to}} more precipitation. [...] As average global temperatures have risen, average global precipitation has also increased. [...] Precipitation has generally increased over land north of 30°N from 1900 to 2005, but declined over the tropics since the 1970s. [...] Eastern portions of North America have become wetter. [...] There {{has been an increase}} in the number of heavy precipitation events over many areas during the past century, as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughts—especially in the tropics and subtropics. [...] Over the contiguous United States, total annual precipitation increased at an average rate of 6.1percent per century since 1900, with the greatest increases within the East North Central climate region (11.6percent per century) and the South (11.1percent). Hawaii was the only region to show a decrease (−9.25percent). [...] From this excess precipitation, crop losses are expected to increase by US$3billion (2002 dollars) <b>annually</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> next 30 years.|$|E

500|$|The Wildlife Conservation Society, which {{supports}} the Prospect Park Zoo {{through a combination}} of private funds and subsidies from the city, is vulnerable to funding shortfalls such as the one on April 15, 2003, when Mayor Michael Bloomberg published his [...] "doomsday budget" [...] proposal for the fiscal year beginning in July 2003. Among other cuts to help close an overall $3.8 billion budget deficit, the Mayor proposed to cut all city funding for the Prospect Park Zoo and the Queens Zoo, as well as trim funding for the New York Aquarium and the Bronx Zoo. The two zoos were the smallest among the facilities managed by the Wildlife Conservation Society, and had the lowest annual attendance rates, approximately 200,000 for each threatened zoo. In contrast, the Bronx Zoo boasted annual attendance of two million and the Central Park Zoo enjoyed one million visitors <b>annually.</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> next two months, the fate of the two zoos hung in limbo while the city's executive branch and City Council hammered out a compromise budget.
