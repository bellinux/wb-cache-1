5|$|The date of Krishna's {{birth is}} celebrated every year as Janmashtami. According to mythologies in the Jain tradition, Krishna was {{a cousin of}} Neminatha, the 22nd Tirthankara of the Jains. Neminatha is {{believed}} in the Jain tradition {{to have been born}} 84,000 years before the 9th-centuryBCE Parshvanatha. Based on interpreting the events <b>and</b> <b>circumstances</b> described in the Puranas, several Indian sources place Krishna as an actual historic person and to a much later period, about 3100BCE.|$|E

5|$|The various musical themes {{associated}} with the Rhinemaidens are regarded as among the most lyrical in the entire Ring cycle, bringing to it rare instances of comparative relaxation and charm. The music contains important melodies and phrases which are reprised and developed elsewhere in the operas to characterise other individuals <b>and</b> <b>circumstances,</b> and to relate plot developments {{to the source of}} the narrative. It is reported that Wagner played the Rhinemaidens' lament at the piano, on the night before he died in Venice, in 1883.|$|E

5|$|A {{black hole}} is {{a region of}} spacetime exhibiting such strong {{gravitational}} effects that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate <b>and</b> <b>circumstances</b> of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed. In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the general}} custom of Europe {{in the late}} {{classical}} and early Middle Ages, he was popularly recognised after his death as a saint, along with several hundred other Welsh men and women. But the date <b>and</b> <b>circumstances</b> of {{the foundation of the}} church, and of Padarn's life were long forgotten when it was decided in the twelfth century that he should be commemorated in a Vita or Latin Life, following the example of the Life of St David written at Llanbadarn about 1090. That in turn had followed a European tradition of writing such lives. They are not biographies as we understand them today. Instead they were hagiographies, designed to elevate the saint’s status as a holy person of miraculous achievements.|$|E
5|$|In April 2016, {{after missing}} the initial October 2015 deadline, Caltrain {{requested}} {{a third party}} review of the CBOSS project from the American Public Transportation Association (APTA). APTA noted that Caltrain was not effectively managing the project schedule and cost because of generally poor communication between Caltrain's project management and Parsons, and Caltrain's project manager {{did not have the}} technical experience or authority to resolve technical and contractual issues with Parsons. In February 2017, Caltrain terminated its contract with Parsons for failure to perform on time and budget and announced potential litigation. Parsons filed suit on February 22, saying delays were due to changing client requirements <b>and</b> <b>circumstances</b> beyond their control. Caltrain filed suit a week later, seeking $98million in damages; although the system has been mostly installed, testing is still incomplete.|$|E

The rules were constantly altered and elaborated upon by the political decision makers in Washington and Vientiane and bore little relation to the reality on the ground.

5|$|The {{chronology}} <b>and</b> <b>circumstances</b> {{surrounding the}} conclusion of Lǫgmaðr's reign are uncertain. According to one source, he voluntarily resigned the kingship and journeyed to Jerusalem where he died. This account could be evidence that he died on crusade: one possibility is the First Crusade, perhaps in the entourage of Robert II, Duke of Normandy; another possibility is the so-called Norwegian Crusade, in the entourage of Sigurðr Magnússon, King of Norway. Although one source claims that Lǫgmaðr's trek to the Holy Land was undertaken in remorse for the cruelty he had inflicted upon Haraldr, {{another possibility is that}} he was forced into exile instead. Whatever the case, it is apparent that about a decade after Magnús' death, the Crovan dynasty was restored to the kingship in the person of Lǫgmaðr's youngest brother.|$|E
5|$|The king {{determined}} the tax levels based on need <b>and</b> <b>circumstances</b> {{in the kingdom}} while ensuring that an undue burden was not placed on the peasants. The land owner or tenant paid a variety of taxes, including land taxes, produce taxes and payment of the overhead for maintenance of the Gavunda (village head). Land taxes were varied, based on type of land, its produce and situation and ranged from 8% to 16%. A Banavasi inscription of 941 mentions reassessment of land tax due to the drying up of an old irrigation canal in the region. The land tax may have been as high as 20% to pay for expenses of a military frequently at war. In most of the kingdom, land taxes were paid in goods and services and rarely was cash accepted. A portion of all taxes earned by the government (usually 15%) was returned to the villages for maintenance.|$|E
5|$|The year <b>and</b> <b>circumstances</b> of Ragnall's {{death are}} uncertain, as {{surviving}} contemporary sources failed to mark his demise. According to clan tradition {{preserved in the}} Book of Clanranald, Ragnall may have died in 1207. However, no corroborating evidence supports this date, and {{there is reason to}} believe that dates in this source are unreliable. In fact, this source misplaces Somairle's death by sixteen years, which may indicate that Ragnall himself died some sixteen years earlier (in 1191). If this date is correct then Ragnall's death may be related to his defeat suffered at the hands of his brother. However, the Chronicle of Mann, which records the 1192 conflict between Ragnall and Áengus, gives no hint of Ragnall's demise in its account. Another possibility is that Ragnall may have been slain sometime around 1209 and 1210, during yet more internal conflict amongst the meic Somairle.|$|E

Still, legislation may be necessary and proper to meet all the various cases <b>and</b> <b>circumstances</b> to be affected by it, and to prescribe proper modes of redress for its violation in letter or spirit.

5|$|While {{there is}} a general {{consensus}} on the cause <b>and</b> <b>circumstances</b> of Bhimsen's death, {{there is a}} disagreement on the exact date of his death. Baburam Acharya contends that Bhimsen attempted suicide on 28 July in his house and died nine days later on 5 August by the banks of Bishnumati; while Henry Oldfield, K.L. Pradhan, and Gyanmani Nepali contend that the suicide was attempted on 20 July and the death occurred nine days later on 28 July in his house, only after which his dead body was disposed by the banks of Bishnumati.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surprise}} death of Malamir in 836, the Bulgarian throne passed to Presian I (836–852), who too was likely underage. As {{evidenced by the}} Presian Inscription from Philippi, Isbul retained his position as kavhan and his decisive influence in the Bulgarian court. In 837, the Slavic tribe of the Smolyani (Smolenoi), who inhabited the lower Nestos (Mesta) River and Western Thrace near Drama, rose against their Byzantine rulers. The inscription of Philippi mentions large-scale Bulgarian activity in the lands of the Smolyani. The Bulgarian forces were led by Isbul, {{as well as the}} ichirgu-boil (commander of the capital garrison) and the head priest. As the inscription is damaged, it is unclear who Presian and Isbul supported in that conflict. However, during this campaign the Bulgarian army conquered most of Macedonia including Philippi, where the inscription was found. From that point on, Isbul disappears from the sources, and there is no information about the date <b>and</b> <b>circumstances</b> of his death.|$|E

5|$|Early lyrics {{drew on the}} band's {{blues and}} folk roots, often mixing lyrical {{fragments}} from different songs. Many of the band's songs dealt with themes of romance, unrequited love and sexual conquest, which were common in rock, pop and blues music. Some of their lyrics, especially those derived from the blues, have been interpreted as misogynistic. Particularly on Led Zeppelin III, they incorporated elements of mythology and mysticism into their music, which largely grew out of Plant's interest in legends and history. These elements were often taken to reflect Page's interest in the occult, which resulted in accusations that the recordings contained subliminal satanic messages, {{some of which were}} said to be contained in backmasking; these claims were generally dismissed by the band and music critics. Susan Fast argues that as Plant emerged as the band's main lyricist, the songs more obviously reflected his alignment with the West Coast counterculture of the 1960s. In the later part of the band's career Plant's lyrics became more autobiographical, and less optimistic, drawing on his own experiences <b>and</b> <b>circumstances.</b>|$|E
