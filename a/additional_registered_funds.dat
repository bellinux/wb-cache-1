5000|$|In {{addition}} to these three main registers, men and women often have an <b>additional</b> <b>register</b> specific to their sex.

[...] This register {{is also known as}} the whistle register. [...] Both men and women, women even more so than men, often require training to easily access the pitches within these registers. Men and women with lower voices rarely sing in these registers. Lower voiced women in particular receive very little if any training in the flageolet register. Men have one more <b>additional</b> <b>register</b> called the strohbass, which lies below the chest voice. Singing in this register is hard on the vocal cords, and therefore, is hardly ever used.|$|R

We present such algorithms for two restricted variants of the shortest path problem. First, we describe how to report a simple path between two arbitrary nodes in a given tree. Using a technique called “computing instead of storing”, we obtain a naive algorithm that needs quadratic time and a constant number of <b>additional</b> <b>registers.</b> We then show how to improve the running time to linear by applying a technique named “simulated parallelization”. Second, we show how to compute a shortest geodesic path between two points in a simple polygon in quadratic time and with constant work-space. Submitted...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analysis}} Swiss <b>registered</b> <b>funds</b> of hedge funds. Thus, {{a well-defined}} universe is analysed {{which is quite}} unique among fund of hedge funds research. I found similar results like previous research for the survivorship bias which accounts for about 1 % of the annual mean performance. Contrary to existing studies for other universes is the negative backfill bias for Swiss <b>registered</b> <b>funds</b> of hedge funds between 0. 09 % and 0. 41 %. Possible explanations could be high initial cost or small assets in the start up phase. I also {{found it to be}} crucial if a parametric or non-parametric test is used to evaluate the mean returns. Since most of the parametric tests are not significant, but the signs of the difference are mostly identical, the parametric test is in most cases not accurate. I conclude that the construction of the “hedgegate Swiss Funds of Hedge Funds Index ” can absorb most of the biases and therefore leads to a quite representative performance for the Swiss fund of hedge funds market...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the register file requirements of dynamically scheduled processors using register renaming and dispatch queues running the SPEC 92 benchmarks. We looked at processors capable of issuing either four or eight instructions per cycle and found that in most cases implementing precise exceptions requires {{a relatively small number}} of <b>additional</b> <b>registers</b> compared to imprecise exceptions. Systems with aggressive non-blocking load support were able to achieve performance similar to processors with perfect memory systems at the cost of some <b>additional</b> <b>registers.</b> Given our machine assumptions, we found that the performance of a four-issue machine with a 32 -entry dispatch queue tends to saturate around 80 registers. For an eight-issue machine with a 64 -entry dispatch queue performance does not saturate until about 128 registers. Assuming the machine cycle time is proportional to the register file cycle time, the 8 -issue machine yields only 20 % higher performance than the 4 -issue machine due in part to the cycle time impact of additional hardware. ...|$|R
