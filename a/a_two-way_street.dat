5|$|But {{transmission}} of Ca2+ is not unidirectional; rather, it is <b>a</b> <b>two-way</b> <b>street.</b> The {{properties of the}} Ca2+ pump SERCA and the channel IP3R present on the ER membrane facilitate feedback regulation coordinated by MAM function. In particular, the clearance of Ca2+ by the MAM allows for spatio-temporal patterning of Ca2+ signaling because Ca2+ alters IP3R activity in a biphasic manner. SERCA is likewise affected by mitochondrial feedback: uptake of Ca2+ by the MAM stimulates ATP production, thus providing energy that enables SERCA to reload the ER with Ca2+ for continued Ca2+ efflux at the MAM. Thus, the MAM is not a passive buffer for Ca2+ puffs; rather it helps modulate further Ca2+ signaling through feedback loops that affect ER dynamics.|$|E
5|$|In {{downtown}} Adrian, {{the highways}} previously split into an uncommon arrangement of one-way streets. This arrangement {{was similar to}} a traffic circle in how the traffic was routed through the central business district on Church, Broad, Front and Winter streets. The first one-way pairing started on Main Street at the intersection with Winter Street. Northbound traffic continued on Main Street, while southbound traffic was routed along Winter Street. At Church Street, westbound Bus. US223/northbound M-52 turned east for a block on Church and then north onto Broad Street. Then the highway designations continued on Broad Street three blocks north to Front Street, passing {{to the east of}} the downtown businesses. The designations were then routed west along Front Street. At Main Street, M-52 turned back north again as <b>a</b> <b>two-way</b> <b>street.</b> In the opposite direction, southbound M-52 traffic was diverted from Main west on Front Street. Front Street west of Main Street carried southbound M-52 and westbound Bus. US223 traffic one block west to Winter Street, which then turned down Winter. Westbound Bus. US223 traffic turned west along Maumee Street while eastbound Bus. US223 followed southbound M-52 down Winter to Main Street. This arrangement was ended in November 2009 when the City of Adrian converted all of the one-way streets to two-way traffic. Downtown streets had been converted to one-way traffic between 1950 and 1973.|$|E

25|$|Broadway {{once was}} <b>a</b> <b>two-way</b> <b>street</b> for its entire length. The present status, {{in which it}} runs one-way {{southbound}} south of Columbus Circle (59th Street), came about in several stages. On June 6, 1954, Seventh Avenue became southbound and Eighth Avenue became northbound south of Broadway. None of Broadway became one-way, but the increased southbound traffic between Columbus Circle (Eighth Avenue) and Times Square (Seventh Avenue) caused the city to re-stripe that section of Broadway for four southbound and two northbound lanes. Broadway became one-way from Columbus Circle south to Herald Square (34th Street) on March 10, 1957, in conjunction with Sixth Avenue becoming one-way from Herald Square north to 59th Street and Seventh Avenue becoming one-way from 59th Street south to Times Square (where it crosses Broadway). On June 3, 1962, Broadway became one-way south of Canal Street, with Trinity Place and Church Street carrying northbound traffic. Another change was made on November 10, 1963, when Broadway became one-way southbound from Herald Square to Madison Square (23rd Street) and Union Square (14th Street) to Canal Street, and two routes – Sixth Avenue south of Herald Square and Centre Street, Lafayette Street, and Fourth Avenue south of Union Square – became one-way northbound. Finally, {{at the same time}} as Madison Avenue became one-way northbound and Fifth Avenue became one-way southbound, Broadway was made one-way southbound between Madison Square (where Fifth Avenue crosses) and Union Square on January 14, 1966, completing its conversion south of Columbus Circle.|$|E

[...] Hence, if theories are theory-laden then so are the senses, and perception itself {{can be seen as a}} species of abductive inference, its difference being that it is beyond control and hence beyond critique – in a word, incorrigible. [...] This in no way conflicts with the fallibility and revisability of scientific concepts, since it is only the immediate percept in its unique individuality or [...] "thisness" [...] – what the Scholastics called its haecceity – that stands beyond control and correction. [...] Scientific concepts, on the other hand, are general in nature, and transient sensations do in another sense find correction within them.
