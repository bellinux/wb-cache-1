5|$|Connected {{protected}} areas {{are important for}} the conservation of slow lorises because these primates are not adapted to travel long distances on the ground. Training for enforcement officials helps improve identification and the <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> legal protection. Sanctuaries and rescue facilities are available to provide both temporary and lifelong care for confiscated slow lorises. Zoo populations of some species have not bred much and have grown too old to reproduce, although the pygmy slow loris is doing well at some facilities, such as the San Diego Zoo.|$|E

The money for their startup came from the $5000 that Lefkow had obtained while on America's Funniest Home Videos. The idea to make bacon spreadable came from a customer's request. Together, they created interest in their products by going to numerous sporting events dressed in bacon costumes and used social networking sites to raise <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> company.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarians {{were for}} a long time grouped with Ctenophores in the phylum Coelenterata, but {{increasing}} <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla. Modern cnidarians are generally classified into four main classes: sessile Anthozoa (sea anemones, corals, sea pens); swimming Scyphozoa (jellyfish) and Cubozoa (box jellies); and Hydrozoa, a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms, and has both sessile members such as Hydra and colonial swimmers such as the Portuguese Man o' War. Staurozoa have recently been recognised as a class in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa, and the parasitic Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa are now recognized as highly derived cnidarians rather than more closely related to the bilaterians.|$|E

Drugs commonly alleged to induce psychotic symptoms include alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, cathinones, psychedelic drugs (such as LSD and psilocybin), κ-opioid receptor agonists (such as enadoline and salvinorin A) and NMDA receptor antagonists (such as phencyclidine and ketamine).|$|E
25|$|Much of Stieve's {{research}} was conducted during the 1930s, after the Nazi Party had come to power in Germany.

The Nazis imprisoned and executed many of their political opponents, and their corpses became Stieve's primary research material, with his full <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> origin. While much of his work is still considered valuable—among other things, he provided scientific evidence that the rhythm method was not effective in preventing pregnancy—it is considered tainted by his effective collaboration with the Nazi regime's political repression, especially in light of its later genocides.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} suggests that impairment in theory of mind negatively affects clinical insight, the patient's <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> mental illness. Insight requires theory of mind—a patient {{must be able to}} adopt a third-person perspective and see the self as others do. A patient with good insight would be able to accurately self-represent, by comparing oneself with others and by viewing oneself from the perspective of others. Insight allows a patient to recognize and react appropriately to his symptoms; however, a patient who lacks insight would not realize that he has a mental illness, because of his inability to accurately self-represent. Therapies that teach patients perspective-taking and self-reflection skills can improve abilities in reading social cues and taking the perspective of another person.|$|E

According to Candradhara Sarma, Turiya state is where the foundational Self is realized, it is measureless, neither cause nor effect, all prevading, without suffering, blissful, changeless, self-luminous, real, immanent in all things and transcendent.

25|$|Various studies {{indicate}} that the perceived intention to move (have moved) can be manipulated. Studies {{have focused on the}} pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) of the brain, in which readiness potential indicating the beginning of a movement genesis has been recorded by EEG. In one study, directly stimulating the pre-SMA caused volunteers to report a feeling of intention, and sufficient stimulation of that same area caused physical movement. In a similar study, it was found that people with no visual <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> body can have their limbs be made to move without having any awareness of this movement, by stimulating premotor brain regions. When their parietal cortices were stimulated, they reported an urge (intention) to move a specific limb (that they wanted to do so). Furthermore, stronger stimulation of the parietal cortex resulted in the illusion of having moved without having done so.|$|E
