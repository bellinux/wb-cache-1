While I thought <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>making</b> your fortune (as <b>you</b> said <b>you</b> <b>were)</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>making</b> {{yourself}} a beggar, eh? Dear me! And so it comes to pass that I hold every security you could scrape together, and a bill of sale upon the--upon the stock and property,' said Quilp standing up and looking about him, as if to assure himself that none of it had been taken away.

(Kobusa et al, 1982) There are two {{possible explanations for}} the perception that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not <b>making</b> any progress in the Alexander Technique: 1) <b>You</b> <b>are</b> not <b>making</b> any progress in the Alexander Technique. 2) <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> progress but <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not aware of it. If {{it is the case}} that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not <b>making</b> any progress then there are three possible reasons for that: 1) <b>You</b> <b>are</b> badly taught 2) <b>You</b> <b>are</b> wrongly applying the principles and procedures 3) The whole thing is a load of nonsense and doesn’t work anyway Let us begin with number three.
