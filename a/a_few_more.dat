5|$|A {{tropical}} {{wave that}} crossed Central America organized and {{developed into a}} tropical depression on June 27. Contrary to forecasts, the depression did not strengthen further because of strong wind shear. By June 29, the depression had become a remnant low, which was observed as a swirl of clouds for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> days before dissipating.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the year, Hudson's colony was {{the first}} {{established}} settlement in present-day Summit County. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> settlers arrived in 1801, and in 1802 the settlement became officially known as Hudson Township.|$|E
5|$|Sarria {{continued}} to perform and agitate at the Black Cat until, after some 15years of unrelenting police pressure, the bar lost its liquor license in 1963. The Black Cat stayed open as a luncheonette for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> months before finally closing for good in February 1964.|$|E

5|$|A quick cut later, the costumed {{character}} {{is looking at}} the camera again with hands at its sides. After <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> jump cuts in which they turn to the right and back again, the figure stands still, then looks to its left slowly. The figure looks down to where a box with various triangular sections appears, then to their right as the image seems to fragment briefly. For the remainder of the video, the cloaked figure stands still with its back to the wall, with the camera apparently handheld again and occasional video effects briefly doubling the image.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave formed Tropical Depression Nine-E on August 26. It was {{upgraded to}} {{a tropical storm}} and named Genevieve the next day. It moved westward and nearly strengthened to a hurricane, peaking in intensity on August 28. At that point, the cyclone encountered cooler waters, which caused it to weaken slowly, weakening to a depression on August 30. The depression hung on until it lost convection on the September 2. A swirl of remnant clouds persisted for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> days. Genevieve had no impact on land, with no reports of casualties or damage being received by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E

60|$|The {{moon was}} rising dimly in the watery sky; {{the rain had}} ceased; the {{friendly}} darkness which had hidden the French position from the German scouts was lessening every moment.

5000|$|Tucumcari is {{the setting}} {{of one of the}} first scenes in Sergio Leone's 1965 film For <b>a</b> <b>Few</b> Dollars <b>More,</b> {{starring}} Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Gian Maria Volontè. However, this is a prochronism, as Tucumcari was founded many years after the historical period in which For <b>a</b> <b>Few</b> Dollars <b>More</b> takes place.|$|R
5|$|After the Lancastrians {{had ceased}} loosing their arrows, Fauconberg ordered his archers {{to step forward}} again to shoot. When they had {{exhausted}} their ammunition, the Yorkists plucked arrows off {{the ground in front}} of them—arrows loosed by their foes—and continued loosing. Coming under attack without any effective response of its own, the Lancastrian army moved from its position to engage the Yorkists in close combat. Seeing the advancing mass of men, the Yorkist archers shot <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> volleys before retreating behind their ranks of men-at-arms, leaving thousands of arrows in the ground to hinder the Lancastrian attack.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{eagerness to}} start out again, Amundsen waited until mid-October and the first hints of spring. He was ready to leave on 15October, but was held up by the weather for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> days. On 19October 1911 the five men, with four sledges and fifty-two dogs, began their journey. The weather quickly worsened, and in heavy fog the party strayed into the field of crevasses that Johansen's depot party had {{discovered}} the previous autumn. Wisting later recalled how his sledge, with Amundsen aboard, nearly disappeared down a crevasse when the snow bridge broke underneath it.|$|E
5|$|Evidently {{the great}} mass of laboring men failed to {{comprehend}} the situation. Too much then, as now, capital was their enemy, not their friend. Too much then, as now, in their way of thinking, there was no limit {{to the ability of}} capital. They did not see that capital could not pay wages, buy raw material and manufacture goods unless it could sell its products and get returns. And if <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> intelligent did see these things the pressure of hungry wives and children obscured all reason and they were ready to go along on anything that offered a shadow of relief.|$|E

5|$|In 1866 William C. Clayton {{became the}} institute's {{principal}} and {{presided over the}} school for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> terms.

5|$|In Mauritius, a {{total of}} 200people {{evacuated}} to storm shelters due to the cyclone. The island was under a Cyclone Warning Class III for 36hours, and for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> hours it was under a Cyclone Warning Class IV, the latter meaning wind gusts of 120km/h (75mph) were reported or expected. Prior to the storm affecting the area, officials in Réunion closed schools and also issued a temporary driving ban. Due {{to the threat of}} the storm, several flights in and out of Mauritius, Réunion, and Rodrigues were canceled. Fishermen were banned from sailing out to sea.|$|E

5|$|M-34 was {{designated}} and {{signed with the}} beginning of the state highway system around July1, 1919, along a route that extended to either end of its current routing. These western and eastern extensions were added to other highways during the 1920s, shortening M-34 to roughly its current length. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> changes were made in the mid-1950s and 1960s resulting in the modern routing. M-34 has a short, unsigned sibling, Connector 34, which is better known as Industrial Drive in the Adrian area.|$|E
5|$|McGovern–Hatfield {{was put up}} for a vote {{again in}} 1971, with {{somewhat}} weaker provisions designed to gain more support. In polls, a large majority of the public now favored its intent, and McGovern took his name off a final form of it, as some senators were just objecting to him. Nevertheless, in June 1971, it failed to pass again, gaining only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> votes than the year before. McGovern was now certain that the only way the war would come to a quick end was if there was a new president.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptian {{artillery}} {{failed to}} breach the walls, so Ibrahim decided to launch two ships with cannons {{and have them}} bombard the Maniot defences from the sea. He also combined this attack with infantry assaults, however these failed as the invaders were driven back from the walls eight times. The attacks lasted for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> days before the Egyptians and Ottomans were forced to retreat when news arrived that Kolokotronis was approaching their rear with 2,000 men. The Maniots chased the Egyptians up to Kalamata before withdrawing. Ibrahim lost 2,500 men at Vergas and the Greek losses are unknown.|$|E

5|$|The French did {{not pursue}} the Austrians {{immediately}} {{because they were}} exhausted from two straight days of vicious fighting. After recuperating, they chased the Austrians and caught up with them at Znaim in mid-July. Here Charles signed an armistice with Napoleon and agreed to end the fighting. Military conflict between France and Austria was effectively ended, although <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> months of diplomatic wrangling were required to make the result official.|$|E
5|$|The Frenchmen {{were caught}} off guard and five were killed, with three seriously wounded.

They managed to capture the armoury and proclaimed victory.
