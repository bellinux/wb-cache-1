50|$|<b>Amiflamine</b> shows {{preference}} for inhibiting MAO-A in serotonergic relative to noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons. In other words, at low doses, {{it can be}} used to selectively inhibit MAO-A enzymes in serotonin cells, whereas at higher doses it loses its selectivity. This property is attributed to amiflamine's higher affinity for the serotonin transporter over the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters, as transporter-mediated carriage is required for <b>amiflamine</b> to enter monoaminergic neurons. Other RIMAs such as Esfand, etryptamine & moclobemide would also be expected to behave similarly.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amiflamine</b> (FLA-336) is a {{reversible}} inhibitor of {{monoamine oxidase}} A (MAO-A), thereby being a RIMA, and, {{to a lesser}} extent, semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO), {{as well as a}} serotonin releasing agent (SRA). It is a derivative of the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical classes. The (+)-enantiomer is the active stereoisomer.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{pretreatment}} with either saline or the monoamine oxidase-A inhibitors clorgyline and <b>amiflamine</b> upon the total activity, locomotion and rearing behaviour {{of the rat}} induced by various doses of the monoamine precursor L-tryptophan was studied by use of automated activity boxes. <b>Amiflamine</b> (2. 5 and 5. 0 mg kg- 1, i. p.) increased in a dose-dependent manner total activity {{and to a lesser}} extent, locomotion when given 60 min before L-tryptophan (100 mg kg- 1, i. p.). The increased activity was seen after <b>amiflamine</b> plus either 25 or 75 mg kg- 1 L-tryptophan. Rearing behaviour was not affected. Analysis of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) and its deaminated metabolite 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5 -HIAA) by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection indicated that in both frontal cortex and hypothalamus, <b>amiflamine</b> (at both doses) increased 5 -HT and reduced 5 -HIAA concentrations. Combination of <b>amiflamine</b> with L-tryptophan (100 mg kg- 1, i. p.) resulted in a higher 5 -HT concentration being found than after <b>amiflamine</b> alone. L-Tryptophan treatment alone did not change 5 -HT concentrations but increased 5 -HIAA concentrations. Clorgyline, at a dose of either 1 or 5 mg kg- 1 i. p. plus L-tryptophan (25 or 100 mg kg- 1, i. p.) did not increase total activity, locomotion or behaviour. A number of possible explanations for the differences in the behavioural effects of clorgyline and <b>amiflamine</b> when given with L-tryptophan are discussed. It is concluded that in addition to monoamine oxidase-A inhibition, other pharmacological effects of the drugs, such as 5 -HT release (<b>amiflamine)</b> and inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylation (clorgyline) may be of importance in determining the magnitude of the increase in activity when the compounds are given together with L-tryptophan...|$|E
40|$|Monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) (<b>amiflamine</b> (AMF) and 4 -methylthioamphetamine (MTA)) and MAO-B (Ldeprenyl) inhibitors {{were found}} to be {{cytotoxic}} in a concentration-dependent manner for RCHTcells derived from adult rat hypothalamus. The cytotoxic effects were increased when the inhibitors were co-incubated with dicoumarol and especially with 25 mM AMF+ 100 mM dicoumarol (2. 5 -fold; P < 0. 001). The treatment of RCHT cells solely with AMF induced a marked decrease in the expression of DT-diaphorase mRNA.

40|$|The {{ejaculatory}} {{response and}} other {{components of the}} 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) behavioural syndrome induced by 5 -methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5 -MeODMT) (3 mg kg- 1, i. p.) were studied following single and repeated treatment of rats with eight different monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. Single and repeated treatment with the 5 -HT agonist 5 -MeODMT, and with low doses of the potent releaser of 5 -HT, p-chloroamphetamine (PCA) were {{also included in the}} study. Repeated but not single treatment with 5 -MeODMT reduced strongly but reversibly the ejaculatory response and the behavioural responses. Repeated but not single treatment with the nonselective and irreversible MAO inhibitors nialamide and pargyline reduced markedly the ejaculatory response but only slightly the 5 -HT behavioural responses. Repeated treatment with the irreversible MAO-B inhibitor (-) -deprenyl, with the irreversible MAO-A inhibitor, clorgyline, with the reversible MAO-A inhibitor moclobemide, and with low doses of PCA did not affect either of the responses. Repeated but not single combined treatment with clorgyline plus PCA caused an almost complete blockade of all the four responses. The selective and reversible MAO-A inhibitors (as well as 5 -HT releasers) <b>amiflamine,</b> alpha-ethyltryptamine, and alpha-methyltryptamine reduced markedly the ejaculatory response after both single and repeated treatments. The behavioural responses were blocked only after repeated treatment. It is concluded that single and repeated treatments of rats with different MAO inhibitors do not produce a common alteration in 5 -HT 2 receptor functions. Repeated treatment with 5 -MeODMT caused a blockade of 75 - 95 % of the ejaculatory response and 5 -HT behavioural responses. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
