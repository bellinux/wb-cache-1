5|$|Although {{the newly}} formed BJP was {{technically}} distinct from the Jana Sangh, the bulk of its rank and file were identical to its predecessor, with Vajpayee being its first president. Historian Ramachandra Guha writes that the early 1980s were marked by <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> violence between Hindus and Muslims. The BJP initially moderated the Hindu nationalist stance of its predecessor the Jana Sangh to gain a wider appeal, emphasising its links to the Janata Party and the ideology of Gandhian Socialism. This was unsuccessful, as it won only two Lok Sabha seats in the elections of 1984. The assassination of Indira Gandhi {{a few months earlier}} resulted in <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> support for the Congress which won a record tally of 403 seats, contributing to the low number for the BJP.|$|E
40|$|Lateral bending of {{the trunk}} during terrestrial, quadrupedal {{locomotion}} was analyzed in four species of lizards, using high-speed videography and computerized motion analysis. The focus of the analysis was whether lizards produce a standing or <b>a</b> traveling <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> bending in the trunk during locomotion. Lizards with well-developed limbs (Cnemidophorus tigris and Dipsosaurus dorsalis) exhibit <b>a</b> standing <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> lateral bending at low speeds, which is replaced by <b>a</b> traveling <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> bending as velocity increases. Lizards with diminutive limbs (Gerrhonotus kingii and Eumeces multivirgatus) exhibit <b>a</b> traveling <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> lateral bending, even at the lowest speeds recorded. These results are {{not consistent with the}} ideas that lizards produce <b>a</b> standing <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> lateral bending during locomotion or that amniote vertebrates have lost the ability to produce <b>a</b> traveling <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> lateral flexion due to a change in the central pattern generator that controls locomotion...|$|R
