5|$|Euler also {{pioneered the}} use of <b>analytic</b> methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two {{disparate}} branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, <b>analytic</b> number theory. In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of hypergeometric series, q-series, hyperbolic trigonometric functions and the <b>analytic</b> theory of continued fractions. For example, he proved the infinitude of primes using the divergence of the harmonic series, and he used <b>analytic</b> methods to gain some understanding of the way prime numbers are distributed. Euler's {{work in this area}} {{led to the development of}} the prime number theorem.|$|E

5|$|The logical {{positivism}} movement {{originated in the}} Vienna Circle and was continued by British philosopher A. J. Ayer. The Vienna Circle adopted the distinction between <b>analytic</b> and synthetic statements: <b>analytic</b> statements are those whose meaning is contained within the words themselves, such as definitions, tautologies or mathematical statements, while synthetic statements make claims about reality. To determine whether a synthetic statement is meaningful, the Vienna Circle developed a verifiability theory of meaning, which proposed that for a synthetic statement to have cognitive meaning, its truthfulness must be empirically verifiable. Because claims about God cannot be empirically verified, the logical positivists argued that religious propositions are meaningless.|$|E

25|$|One may ask <b>analytic</b> {{questions}} about algebraic numbers, and use <b>analytic</b> means to answer such questions; {{it is thus}} that algebraic and <b>analytic</b> number theory intersect. For example, one may define prime ideals (generalizations of prime numbers {{in the field of}} algebraic numbers) and ask how many prime ideals there are up to a certain size. This question can be answered by means of an examination of Dedekind zeta functions, which are generalizations of the Riemann zeta function, a key <b>analytic</b> object at the roots of the subject. This {{is an example of a}} general procedure in <b>analytic</b> number theory: deriving information about the distribution of a sequence (here, prime ideals or prime numbers) from the <b>analytic</b> behavior of an appropriately constructed complex-valued function.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} derive new {{insights}} from data using advanced machine learning or <b>analytics</b> techniques {{can enhance the}} decision-making process in companies. Nevertheless, {{researchers have found that}} the actual application of <b>analytics</b> in companies is still in its initial stages. Therefore, this paper studies by means of a descriptive survey the application of <b>analytics</b> with regards to five different aspects as defined by the DELTA model: data, enterprise or organization, leadership, targets or techniques and applications, and the analysts who apply the techniques themselves. We found that the <b>analytics</b> organization in companies matures with regards to these aspects. As such, if companies started earlier with <b>analytics,</b> they apply nowadays more complex techniques such as neural networks, and more advanced applications such as HR <b>analytics</b> and predictive <b>analytics.</b> Moreover, <b>analytics</b> is differently propagated throughout companies as they mature with a larger focus on department-wide or organization-wide <b>analytics</b> and a more advanced data governance policy. Next, we research by means of clustering how these characteristics can indicate the <b>analytics</b> maturity stage of companies.
