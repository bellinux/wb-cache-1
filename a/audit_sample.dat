Using formulae endorsed by the American Statistical Association, they identify a sample size for each race they intend to verify. The size of the sample depends primarily the margin of victory in the targeted race. Votes in the sample are then manually counted and compared to the computer-tabulated results. If the <b>audit</b> <b>sample</b> produces the same result as the computer-tabulated results, within the selected risk limit, the outcome is confirmed and the audit is complete. If the <b>audit</b> <b>sample</b> does not confirm the original winner within the risk limit, a larger sample is selected and counted.

40|$|PURPOSE: The two {{approaches}} to audit sampling; statistical and nonstatistical {{have been examined}} in this study. The overall {{purpose of the study}} is to explore the current extent at which statistical and nonstatistical sampling approaches are utilized by independent auditors during auditing practices. Moreover, the study also seeks to achieve two additional purposes; the first is to find out whether auditors utilize different <b>sampling</b> techniques when <b>auditing</b> SME´s (Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise) and big companies and the second is to find out some common selection methods that are used by auditors for selecting statistical or nonstatistical <b>audit</b> <b>samples</b> during <b>audit</b> <b>sampling</b> practices.   METHOD: The population that has been investigated consists of professional auditors residing in Umeå-Sweden. Data for the study was collected by conducting semi-structured interviews and convenient sampling; a non-probability sampling technique was used for respondent’s selection. An interviewed guide was sent to respondents in advance with the objective of giving them the opportunity to have both mental and psychological preparations prior to each interview scheduled date. The semi-structured interview technique was adopted because it was a suitable approach to extract valuable information and in-depth explanations from auditors about the current extent of the use of statistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling</b> and nonstatistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling</b> during <b>auditing</b> practices. Ultimately, the selected respondents actively participated in which they thoroughly expressed their views and experiences about <b>audit</b> <b>sampling,</b> statistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling,</b> and nonstatistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling.</b>   RESULTS: Statistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling</b> and nonstatistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling</b> were found to be used most often by auditors when auditing the financial statements of big companies compare to SME´s where nonstatistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling</b> is most often used. Therefore, both statistical and nonstatistical samplings are in dominant utilization by auditors in Sweden. <b>Audit</b> <b>samples</b> are selected through random selection method and systematic selection methods when using statistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling</b> and for nonstatistical audit sampling; items are selected by the use of professional judgment. However, auditors in Sweden are more inclined with the use of random selection method for statistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling</b> and their professional judgment for nonstatistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling.</b> The main reasons for the auditors using both statistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling</b> and nonstatistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling</b> are to minimize risks and to guarantee high quality audit. The conclusion of the study was that auditors in Sweden use both statistical and nonstatistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling</b> techniques when <b>auditing</b> big companies, use nonstatistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling</b> when <b>auditing</b> SME´s, select <b>samples</b> using random selection method and systematic selection method for statistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling</b> and for nonstatistical <b>audit</b> <b>sampling,</b> items are selected within the parameters of their professional judgment...|$|R

Bias and variance of the turnover estimates caused by classification errors are estimated by a bootstrap resampling approach. In addition, we study the extent to which manual selective editing at micro level can improve the accuracy. Our analyses reveal which industries do not meet preset quality criteria. Surprisingly, more selective editing can result in less accurate estimates for specific industries, and a fixed allocation of editing effort over industries is more effective than an allocation in proportion with the accuracy and population size of each industry.

When the number of inspectees is large enough, bounded SRS is nearly as good as any efficient audit rule, which demands the lowest committed budget necessary to implement the target audit probability.

40|$|Objective: To gain {{a deeper}} {{understanding}} of the clinical journey taken by orofacial pain patients from initial presentation in primary care to treatment by oral and maxillofacial surgery. Design: Retrospective <b>audit.</b> <b>Sample</b> and methods: Data were collected from 101 consecutive patients suffering from chronic orofacial pain, attending oral and maxillofacial surgery clinics between 2009 and 2010. Once the patients were identified, information was drawn from their hospital records and referral letters, and a predesigned proforma was completed by a single examiner (EVB). Basic descriptive statistics and non-parametric inferential statistical techniques (Krushal-Wallis) were used to analyse the data. Data and discussion: Sixdefinitive orofacial pain conditions were represented in the data set, 75 % of which were temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Individuals within our study were treated in ninedifferent hospital settings and were referred to 15 distinct specialties. The mean number of consultations received by the patients in our study across all care settings is seven (SD 5). The mean number of specialities that the subjects were assessed by was three (SD 1). The sample set had a total of 341 treatment attempts to manage their chronic orofacial pain conditions, of which only 83 (24 %) of all the treatments attempted yielded a successful outcome. Conclusion: Improved education and remuneration for primary care practitioners as well as clear care pathways for patients with chronic orofacial pain should be established to reduce multiple re-referrals and improve efficiency of care. The creation of specialist regional centres for chronic orofacial pain may be considered to manage severe cases and drive evidence-based practice. Â© 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We wonder what is actually sampling and how did it appear? Audit sampling involves the application of audit procedures to less than 100 % of items within an account balance or class of transactions. Nowadays the technique is indispensable, the economic entities operating with sophisticated computer systems and large amounts of data. Economic globalization and complexity of capital markets has made possible not only the harmonization of international accounting standards with the national ones, but also the convergence of international accounting and auditing standards with the American regulations. International Standard on Auditing 530 and Statement on Auditing Standard 39 are the two main international and American normalized referentials referring to audit sampling. This article discusses the origin of audit sampling, mentioning {{a brief history of}} the method and different definitions from literature review. The two standards are studied using Jaccard indicators in terms of the degree of similarity and dissimilarity concerning different issues. The Jaccard coefficient measures the degree of convergence of international auditing standards (ISA 530) and U. S. auditing standards (SAS 39). International auditing standards and American auditing standards, study the sampling problem, both regulations presenting common points with regard to accepted sampling techniques, factors influencing the <b>audit</b> <b>sample,</b> treatment of identified misstatements and the circumstances in which sampling is appropriate.

In 2008, the UK National Prescribing Centre (NPC) issued guidance regarding the minimum information to be communicated upon hospital discharge. This study evaluates the extent of adherence to this guidance and identifies predictors of adherence. Methods: This was an audit of discharge summaries received by medical practices in one UK primary care trust of patients hospitalized for 24 h or longer. Each discharge summary was scored against the applicable NPC criteria which were organized into: ‘patient, admission and discharge’, ‘medicine’ and ‘therapy change’ information. Results: Of 3444 discharge summaries audited, 2421 (70. 3 %) were from two teaching hospitals and 906 (26. 3 %) from three district hospitals. Unplanned admissions accounted for 2168 (63. 0 %) of the <b>audit</b> <b>sample</b> and 74. 6 % (2570) of discharge summaries were electronic. Mean (95 % CI) adherence to the total NPC minimum dataset was 71. 7 % [70. 2, 73. 2]. Adherence to patient, admission and discharge information was 77. 3 % (95 % CI 77. 0, 77. 7), 67. 2 % (95 % CI 66. 3, 68. 2) for medicine information and 48. 9 % (95 % CI 47. 5, 50. 3) for therapy change information. Allergy status, co-morbidities, medication history and rationale for therapy change were the most frequent omissions. Predictors of adherence included quality of the discharge template, electronic discharge summaries and smaller numbers of prescribed medicines. Conclusions: Despite clear guidance regarding the content of discharge information, omissions are frequent. Adherence to the NPC minimum dataset might be improved by using comprehensive electronic discharge templates and implementation of effective medicines reconciliation at {{both sides of the}} health interface...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop methodology of assessing the quality of the <b>audit</b> <b>sampling.</b> The use of the sampling leads to existence of the risks when an auditor's conclusion, made on the basis of a total sample may be different from the conclusion drawn on the basis of the audit procedures carried out in respect of all population elements. To solve this problem we have created the theoretical model, illustrating the following: the relationship between the audit risk and the methods of the unit’s selection; the relationship between the efficiency of the audit, evaluation of internal control and audit scope; the use of <b>sampling</b> in the <b>audit</b> for internal control testing and substantive procedures...|$|R

Since the incomes from the insurance premiums from vehicle insurance and third-party vehicle insurance have the dominant share of the insurance company's income, the application of this method will be shown in the audit examination of these incomes - incomes from VI and TPVI premiums. For investigating the applicability of these methods in testing the income of other insurance companies, we shall implement the method of variable <b>sampling</b> in the <b>audit</b> testing of the premium income from the three leading insurance companies in Serbia, 'Dunav', 'DDOR' and 'Delta Generali' Insurance...|$|R
