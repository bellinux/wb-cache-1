5|$|Coker {{grew up in}} Linden, New Jersey {{and became}} an Eagle Scout in Troop 32 of Saint Elizabeth's Catholic Church in Linden on January 27, 1959. He has stated that his passion for Scouting {{is one of the}} things that got him through his 6.5years as a POW in North Vietnam, to the point that at times <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{remember}} was the Scout Oath, but not the names of his family members.|$|E
5|$|Kubrick {{shared a}} love of film with his school friend Alexander Singer, who {{after graduating from high}} school had the {{intention}} of directing a film version of Homer's The Iliad. Through Singer, who worked in the offices of the newsreel production company, The March of Time, Kubrick learned that it could cost $40,000 to make a proper short film, money he could not afford. However, he had $1500 in savings and managed to produce a few short documentaries fueled by encouragement from Singer. He began learning <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> about filmmaking on his own, calling film suppliers, laboratories, and equipment rental houses.|$|E
5|$|On 31 January 2017, Jesé {{signed for}} Las Palmas on loan {{until the end}} of the season, with club {{chairman}} Miguel Ángel Ramírez revealing that the player had taken a massive pay cut in order to join his hometown club. The next day, he was presented in front of 9,000 fans at the Estadio de Gran Canaria, and pledged to do <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> to help the club qualify for European football. He debuted for the club on 6 February, coming on as a second-half substitute for Vicente Gómez in a 1−0 loss away to Granada, and made his first start the following week in a loss to Sevilla by the same scoreline.|$|E

5|$|A Cape Coloured of Indian and Portuguese ancestry, D'Oliveira left South Africa {{primarily}} because the era's apartheid legislation seriously restricted his career prospects on racial grounds and barred {{him from the}} all-white Test team. He qualified for Worcestershire County Cricket Club through residency in 1964 and first played for England two years later. The consequences of D'Oliveira's possible inclusion in the 1968–69 MCC tour of South Africa were discussed by English and South African cricketing bodies as early as 1966. Manoeuvring by cricketing and political figures in both countries did little to bring the matter to a head. The MCC's priority was to maintain traditional links with South Africa and have the series go ahead without incident. South Africa's Prime Minister B.J. Vorster sought to appease international opinion by publicly indicating that D'Oliveira's inclusion would be acceptable, but secretly did <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> to prevent it.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{arrived at}} Maracaibo {{to find the}} city largely deserted, its {{residents}} having been forewarned of his approach by the fortress's troops. He spent three weeks in the city, ransacking and plundering what he could. Privateers searched the surrounding jungle to find the escapees; they, {{and some of the}} remaining occupants, were tortured to find where money or treasure had been hidden. Satisfied he had stolen <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> he sailed south across Lake Maracaibo, to Gibraltar. The town's occupants refused to surrender, and the fort fired enough of a barrage to ensure Morgan kept his distance. He anchored a short distance away and his men landed by canoe and assaulted the town from the landward approach. He met scant resistance, as many of the occupants had fled into the surrounding jungle. He spent five weeks in Gibraltar, and there was again evidence that torture was used to force residents to reveal hidden money and valuables.|$|E

25|$|Demeter of Mysia had {{a seven-day}} festival at Pellené in Arcadia. Pausanias passed the shrine to Demeter at Mysia {{on the road}} from Mycenae to Argos but <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> draw out to explain the archaic name was a myth of an eponymous Mysius who venerated Demeter.|$|E
25|$|His son, William Rutter Dawes, {{was born}} on 17 Dec. 1797, and christened at Portsea, Hampshire, on 11 Feb 1798. Trained as a clergyman, he became an {{astronomer}} of note.

25|$|Many {{accounts}} {{have been}} given of the many creature comforts he provided his comrades of the 8th Cavalry Regiment during imprisonment. They were both spiritual and physical. He provided endless hours of prayer and what nourishment he could find to <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{to keep them from}} starving to death.|$|E

25|$|Captain Bucey was not {{unaware of}} how busy and {{profitable}} the season would be. In anticipation of extending the BC Express's route {{all the way}} to Tête Jaune Cache, he rode the CPR to Edmonton, Alberta and then took the GTP to Tête Jaune Cache. From there he canoed downstream with a companion to Fort George, learning <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> about {{the upper reaches of the}} new route.|$|E
25|$|Even so, Maurice did <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> to {{reinforce}} his troops on Balkans, as Slavic pillaging continued. He hoped to acquire more money by cutting the soldiers' payment by a quarter. Announcing these plans {{led to a}} mutiny on the Persian front in 588, which in turn forced Maurice to abandon the idea. As a consequence, in the Balkans Maurice had only limited means to keep the Avars and Slavs at bay {{for the next three}} years.|$|E
25|$|He {{was in a}} {{small boat}} {{sculling}} across the harbour together with another crew member Able Seaman Cecil Barber near to where the Ben Seyr was docked. In testimony Barber said that {{as they approached the}} dock gates Kneale fell into the water and although Barber did <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> to save him, he subsequently drowned. An inquest into Kneale's death was held later that night on board the Ben Seyr in order to allow the vessel to sail on the night tide.|$|E

25|$|Konstantin {{sympathized with}} the Poles and, {{ignoring}} {{the advice of}} his brother's generals, he ended martial law and embarked on a program of liberalization. Polish was reinstated as the official language, universities were opened and Konstantin appointed Poles to administrative positions, gathering a distinguished court of Poles and Russians around him. Konstantin did <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> to appease the Poles, but his well-meant reforms did not go far enough for the Polish nationalists who wanted nothing short of independence, by force if necessary.|$|E
25|$|Kagemni {{may have}} written {{instructions}} for his sons {{and they are}} known as the Instructions of Kagemni. The instructions {{are part of the}} Prisse Papyrus, which also contains the teachings of Ptahhotep. At the end of the text regarding Kagemni, it is mentioned that after he learnt <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> about the nature of men, he wrote down what he had learnt so as to pass it onto his children. The text then proceeds to mention that the King of Upper and Lower Egypt Huni had died and was succeeded by Sneferu. Kagemni was appointed as overseer of the pyramid town and Vizier by Sneferu.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the race, Henri and Francis Pélissier were the best. They both finished before the rest in stage two, with Henri crossing the line first. In the third stage, Henri, leading the race, wanted to stop. Organizer Desgrange did <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> to change Pélissier's mind, and finally Pélissier started to race again. He was already 45 minutes behind, and the next three hours he was chasing the rest. He finally caught up, and finished second in the sprint, after his brother Francis. After that victory, Henri Pélissier said that he was a thoroughbred {{and the rest of the}} cyclists were work horses, which made the other cyclists angry. During that third stage, Léon Scieur punctured four times, and lost two hours.|$|E

25|$|There were no {{poor people}} {{in the land of}} Oz, because {{there was no such thing}} as money, and all {{property}} of every sort belonged to the Ruler. Each person was given freely by his neighbors whatever he required for his use, which is as much as anyone may reasonably desire. Every one worked half the time and played half the time, and the people enjoyed the work as much as they did the play, because it is good to be occupied and to have something to do. There were no cruel overseers set to watch them, and no one to rebuke them or to find fault with them. So each one was proud to do <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> for his friends and neighbors, and was glad when they would accept the things he produced.|$|E
25|$|In May 1813, as {{the heir}} {{presumptive}} of the kingdoms of Denmark and Norway, Christian was sent as stattholder (the Danish king's highest representative in overseas territories) to Norway {{to promote the}} loyalty of the Norwegians to the House of Oldenburg, which had been very badly shaken by the disastrous results of Frederick VI's adhesion to the falling fortunes of Napoleon I of France. Christian did <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> personally to strengthen the bonds between the Norwegians and the royal house of Denmark. Though his endeavours were opposed by the so-called Swedish party, which desired a dynastic union with Sweden, he placed himself {{at the head of}} the Norwegian party of independence after the Treaty of Kiel had forced the king to cede Norway to the king of Sweden. He was elected Regent of Norway by an assembly of notables on 16 February 1814.|$|E
25|$|De Keyser's {{career was}} not limited to Amsterdam, and his {{international}} contacts helped him {{to keep in touch with}} the mainstream of European architecture. The Amsterdam city administrators sent him to England where he worked with Inigo Jones (1573-1652). Jones was the first English architect who went to Italy to learn <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> about classical architecture. He studied the famous treatises written by the Roman architect Vitruvius (circa 30 BC), and his intimate knowledge of the work of Palladio (1518-1580) gave him the nickname the English Palladio. The Banqueting House in London, designed for the Stuart monarchs, became the prototype of classical architecture in England. When De Keyser returned to Amsterdam one of Jones’ assistants, Nicholas Stone, joined him. Stone worked with De Keyser in Amsterdam from 1607 to 1613 and even became his son-in-law. De Keyser attention to England and English architecture reflect Amsterdam's position as a commercial centre in Europe.|$|E
