40|$|Abstract:- Submerged <b>arc</b> <b>surfaced</b> layers, {{obtained}} using half-automatic welding device, {{were investigated}} {{in the present}} work. Structural steel C 45 was deposited under the flux AMS 1 (chemical composition: more than 50 % of SiO 2 and MnO) mixed with chromium, molybdenum, graphite powder and powder of inoculant SiCaBa. Changing quantity of inoculant powder added to the flux, layers of various structure and mechanical properties were composed; while feeding of low carbon wire of 1. 2 mm in diameter were continuously delivered into the welding zone. Initial and secondary hardness of layers, alloyed with chromium, molybdenum, manganese and silicon, was increased by powder of the SiCaBa. The opportunity of structural steel deposition using milling chips of high speed steels was estimated. Chips spread on the surface were fused under the flux AMS 1, when arc was struck between welding wire and the substrate; layers were alloyed with alloying elements, presented in the chips and flux.

40|$|A novel ultra-wideband (UWB) TEM {{horn antenna}} fed by a microstrip-type {{transition}} is designed. The feeding structure is directly realized by a microstrip {{line with the}} merit of compact size and UWB. To broaden the low frequency band, an <b>arc</b> <b>surface</b> is added {{at the end of}} the flare plates. Numerical simulation is applied to discuss the effect of the geometry construction which contains the microstrip-type transition and the circular <b>arc</b> <b>surface</b> at the end of radiating arm. Return loss, radiation pattern, and gain of the fabricated antennas are measured. The measured results show that the antenna yields a wide bandwidth ranging from 1 [*]GHZ to 10. 3 [*]GHz with return loss less than − 10 [*]dB. The antenna also achieves unidirectional radiation patterns with stable antenna gain. These characteristics imply that the compact antenna may be used for detecting buried objects in the wall or UWB communication systems of band like GSM, Wi-Fi, and so forth...|$|E
40|$|Unusual {{electronic}} {{property of}} a Weyl semi-metallic nanowire is revealed. Its band dispersion exhibits multiple subbands of partially flat dispersion, originating from the Fermi arc states. Remarkably, the lowest energy flat subbands bear a finite size energy gap, implying that electrons in the Fermi <b>arc</b> <b>surface</b> states are susceptible of the spin Berry phase. This {{is shown to}} be a consequence of spin-to-surface locking in the surface electronic states. We verify this behavior and the existence of spin Berry phase in the low-energy effective theory of Fermi <b>arc</b> <b>surface</b> states on a cylindrical nanowire by deriving the latter from a bulk Weyl Hamiltonian. We point out that in any surface state exhibiting a spin Berry phase pi, a zero-energy bound state is formed along a magnetic flux tube of strength, hc/(2 e). This effect is highlighted in a surfaceless bulk system pierced by a dislocation line, which shows a 1 D chiral mode along the dislocation line. Comment: 9 pages, 9 figure...|$|E

Powder of unalloyed aluminum was fed into the plasma during the PTA surfacing and TiAl-based intermetallic layers were successfully synthesized. The surface layers had no cracks and porosities with optimized conditions of the PTA surfacing.

40|$|Purpose: Plasma Transferred <b>Arc</b> <b>surfacing</b> is {{increasingly}} used in applications where enhancement of wear, corrosion and heat resistance of materials surface is required. The shape of weld bead geometry {{affected by the}} PTA Welding process parameters {{is an indication of}} the quality of the weld. In the paper the modelling, analysis and optimization of weld bead parameters of nickel based overlay deposited by plasma transferred <b>arc</b> <b>surfacing</b> are made. Design/methodology/approach: The experiments were conducted based on a five factor, five level central composite rotatable design and a mathematical model was developed using multiple regression technique. The direct and interaction effects of input process parameters of PTA Hardfacing on weld bead geometry are discussed. Finally, Microsoft Excel Solver has been used to optimize the process parameter with a view to economize the powder and achieve the desirable bead dimensions. Findings: Penetration, dilution and total area are increased when the welding current is increased but reinforcement marginally increases and then decreases. Penetration, weld width, dilution and total area decrease when travel speed is increased. Reinforcement increases slightly and then decreases. Practical implications: The developed mathematical models can be used to predict the dimensions of the weld bead and dilution.

40|$|Weyl semimetals are {{conductors}} whose low-energy bulk excitations are Weyl fermions, whereas their surfaces possess metallic Fermi <b>arc</b> <b>surface</b> states. These Fermi <b>arc</b> <b>surface</b> {{states are}} protected by a topological invariant associated with the bulk electronic wavefunctions of the material. Recently, {{it has been shown}} that the TaAs and NbAs classes of materials harbor such a state of topological matter. We review the basic phenomena and experimental history of the discovery of the first Weyl semimetals, starting with the observation of topological Fermi arcs and Weyl nodes in TaAs and NbAs by angle and spin-resolved surface and bulk sensitive photoemission spectroscopy and continuing through magnetotransport measurements reporting the Adler-Bell-Jackiw chiral anomaly.

40|$|In a topological insulator, {{it is the}} {{electrons}} on the surface or edge that carry the signature of topology. Recently, a novel topological state has been proposed in metals or semimetals (gapless) whose band-structure {{is similar to that}} of a three-dimensional analog of graphene. However, to this date the signature of its topology remains an open question. We report the experimental discovery of a pair of polarized Fermi <b>arc</b> <b>surface</b> state modes in the form of a new type of two-dimensional polarized electron gas on the surfaces of Dirac semimetals. These Fermi <b>arc</b> <b>surface</b> states (FASS) are observed to connect across an even number of bulk band gapless nodes and found to have their spin uniquely locked to their momentum. We show that these states are distinctly different from the topological surface states (TSS) seen in all known topological insulators. Our observed exotic two-dimensional states not only uncover the novel topology of gapless Dirac metals (such as sodium tribismuth Na$_ 3 $Bi) but also opens new research frontiers for the utilization of topological Fermi arc electron gases for a wide range of fundamental physics and spintronic studies.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a locomotive dynamic model {{to study the}} coupler compressed stability and locomotive running safety under severe longitudinal compressive forces, taking into account {{a new model of}} the flattened pin coupler and buffer system employed by heavy-haul locomotives. In this new model, the <b>arc</b> <b>surface</b> contact friction element is built up {{for the first time to}} simulate the compressed contact friction process between the arc surfaces of the coupler tail and the following plate. An improved nonlinear mathematical model of buffers and a coupler rotation angle stop element are also included. After validating the presented locomotive dynamic model by comparing its calculated results with test data, simulations are carried out to analyse the influences of the coupler-tail <b>arc</b> <b>surface</b> and locomotive secondary suspension parameters on the coupler compressed stability and locomotive running safety. Results indicate that the friction coefficient and the arc radius of the coupler-tail arc surfaces have a remarkable influence, and that the locomotive secondary lateral stop and lateral stiffness also have a significant effect. Optimising these parameters could significantly improve the coupler compressed stability and locomotive running safety.

Depending on the magnitude and interplay between the intravalley and intervalley interactions, the Fermi arc connects two nearby or distant valleys. Moreover, the emergence of additional Fermi contours (closed curves not intersecting the Weil points) can be understood in the simplest four-valley approximation.

The candidates in this family are compounds with different chemical formulas AB 2, ABC, ABC 2, and ABCD and their Fermi levels are predominantly populated by nontrivial Weyl fermions. Symmetry of the system requires that the Weyl nodes with opposite chirality are well separated in momentum space. Adjacent Weyl points have the same chirality, thus these Weyl nodes would not annihilate each other with respect to lattice perturbations. As Fermi <b>arcs</b> and <b>surface</b> states connect Weyl nodes with opposite chirality, the large separation of the latter in momentum space guarantees the appearance of very long <b>arcs</b> and <b>surface</b> states.
