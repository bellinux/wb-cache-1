5|$|At 7:45am local time, the ladle in {{question}} {{separated from the}} overhead iron rail that connected it to the blast furnace while it was being positioned over a worktable in preparation to pour out its contents. All 30 tons of liquid steel, which was at a temperature of approximately 1,500 degrees Celsius (2,730 F), was spilled. This liquid steel then burst through the windows <b>and</b> <b>door</b> of an adjoining room five meters away where workers had gathered during a change of shifts, engulfing that room entirely.|$|E

5|$|Although {{most of the}} {{writings}} that have survived from this period are religious in nature, there is sufficient literary evidence that secular writing was also popular in the imperial court. Some of these writings carry useful information on urban life, grandeur of the imperial and provincial courts, royal weddings and ceremonies. Other works refer the general town planning, fortifications and ordnance details at Vijayanagara and other important cities, irrigation reservoirs, merchants and shops dealing {{in a variety of}} commodities. On occasion, authors dwell on mythical cities that reflect their idealised views on contemporary life. Commonly found in these works are description of artists and professionals and their relationship with the court. These included poets, bards, composers, painters, sculptors, dancers, theatrical performers and even wrestlers. Others who find mention are political leaders, ambassadors, concubines, accountants, goldsmiths, moneylenders and even servants <b>and</b> <b>door</b> keepers.|$|E
5|$|In the 15th {{century the}} {{clerestory}} {{was added to}} the nave, along with the Perpendicular two-storied south porch; these reconstruction works necessitated the repositioning of the door on the south aisle, and the building of the present-day western wall of the nave, with a great window <b>and</b> <b>door</b> also in the Perpendicular style. Stained glass windows were installed in the clerestory, but their contents were not recorded, and only small fragments of the mediaeval glass survive today: the arms of the Cheyne family, a human figure, and a shield with fragments of coloured glass, possibly the impaled arms of Woburn and Leicester. A staircase in the porch led to a parvise above; local tradition holds that Thomas Harding was held in the parvise prior to his execution in 1532. The porch also contains a stoup dating from the late 14th century, which although much damaged has survived all subsequent restorations and remodellings unaltered.|$|E

40|$|Keywords：Natural ventilation, {{residential}} building, cooling, {{air change}} rates Abstract. Assessing the energy saving of natural ventilation is difficult, especially for large scale naturally ventilated buildings, {{due to the}} lack of deterministic data and method. This paper presents a method, integrating simulation by both software of DeST-h and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in typical meteorological year (TMY) in Guangzhou, to evaluate quantitatively the natural ventilation cooling effect. The results showed that the cooling effect of natural ventilation was influenced by the windows <b>and</b> <b>doors</b> switching. Air conditioning operating hours reduction in the living room can reach 509 h by natural ventilation during the occupied time with the windows <b>and</b> <b>doors</b> opened, which can reach 325 h with the windows opened <b>and</b> <b>doors</b> closed. The cooling effect of natural ventilation was more significant in windows <b>and</b> <b>doors</b> opened case than that in windows opened <b>and</b> <b>doors</b> closed case. Annual rate of cooling loads reduction in rooms and building were 0. 34 ~ 10. 50 % and 6. 14 % respectively. It is necessary to organize and design building opening to maximize the natural ventilation using...|$|R

5|$|The first {{room from}} the {{corridor}} was the living room, with a wainscot, pilasters, cornice, <b>and</b> <b>door</b> and window frames all of Spanish cedar, and a mantelpiece imported from an Italian chateau. Walls are paneled in green silk, mirroring the rug and furnishings. In its early history, the walls were inlaid with embossed Italian leather. The drawing room, {{sometimes referred to as}} the music room, salon, or parlor was at the center, with paneled walls in ivory white and gold, with gilded moldings and ornaments. There are richly interlaced panels above the doorways with paintings inserted in them. The mantle dates to around 1700, and is of mottled purple and white marble, and has a built-in mirror above it. The room has richly gilt chandeliers hanging from ornamental reliefs in the otherwise plain ceiling. Furniture was of tapestry and gold, with a light rug and yellow and gold curtains at the windows and doors.|$|E
5|$|To {{replace the}} aging Class C trains, from 1985 to 1987, ten T4s were {{converted}} to T1300. They were equipped with a pantograph, received a new front and the doors were moved. Six additional T4s were converted in 1989, and given the designation T8. These only had the pantographs equipped and kept the same front <b>and</b> <b>door</b> arrangement. With {{the introduction of the}} T1300, the western lines could remove the conductor and have single-manned trains with the motorman selling tickets. The T1300-units have had better regularity than the older models they replaced. However, because they are designed for a closed system with automatic train protection, the braking systems are not sufficiently dimensioned for when the drivers use line of sight to regulate the speed and distances between trains. The 1300 units were numbered 1301–1349. After the conversions, Oslo Sporveier operated 49 T1300-cars and 146 T1000-cars. The trains were originally painted red with a beige cheatline.|$|E
