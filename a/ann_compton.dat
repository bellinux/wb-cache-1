50|$|Shaw {{is widely}} {{known for the}} {{question}} he posed to Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Michael Dukakis at his second Presidential debate with George H. W. Bush during the 1988 election, which Shaw was moderating. Knowing that Dukakis opposed the death penalty, Shaw {{asked him if he}} would support an irrevocable death penalty for a man who hypothetically raped and murdered Dukakis's wife. Dukakis responded that he would not; critics felt he framed his response too legalistically and logically, and did not address it sufficiently on a personal level. Kitty Dukakis, among other public figures, found the question inflammatory and unwarranted at a presidential debate. Several journalists also on the panel with Shaw, including <b>Ann</b> <b>Compton,</b> Andrea Mitchell, and Margaret Garrard Warner, expressed an interest in leaving Dukakis's name out of the question.|$|E

40|$|This {{is a plan}} - a {{hypothesis}} in which some ideas are developed for {{the building of a}} path and parks. Through the use of imagery texture, and materials a sense of the possible is evoked. This is also an exploration of designer as an advocate for the user and the used. The forgotten elements. The spaces between. The earth, the river, the senses [...] The site is Brattleboro, Vermont. There is a physical opportunity in Brattleboro to turn the town around. The backs of the old warehouses, the railroad, and the grade change to the Connecticut River are all resources. The possibility for living spaces and markets and recreation is created by the development of a pathway and series of small incursions into the built landscape of the area. by <b>Ann</b> <b>Compton.</b> Thesis (M.
