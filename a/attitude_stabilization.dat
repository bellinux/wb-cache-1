40|$|In {{the past}} several years, a plethora of {{spacecraft}} control techniques have been developed that address the challenging <b>attitude</b> tracking, <b>stabilization</b> and disturbance rejection requirements of these missions. One major aspect that has been typically missing in the research area of attitude control development is the experimental validation of the theoretical results.

40|$|A passive {{magnetic}} <b>attitude</b> <b>stabilization</b> {{system is}} simple, easy to realize, cheap {{and does not}} require software development and energy consumption. Due to these features the passive magnetic <b>attitude</b> <b>stabilization</b> system {{is one of the}} most common <b>attitude</b> <b>stabilization</b> systems implemented on board of small satellites. This system is based on a permanent magnet, which has to provide a restoring torque to align an oriented axis of the satellite with the Earth's magnetic field direction, and a energy dissipation system of the satellite angular motion, which can consist on a set of magnetic hysteresis rods. Despite the simplicity of this <b>attitude</b> <b>stabilization</b> system, predicting performance in orbit and evaluating the obtainable accuracy is not trivial. The main problem is represented by necessity of an accurate modelling of the hysteresis rod magnetization and by the evaluation of the main magnetic parameters of the rods. This paper deals with sizing, choice of the material, manufacturing process, arrangement of a set of hysteresis rods on board small satellites and with the development of an experimental setup to measure hysteresis rod parameters.

50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of magnetorquers is that very high magnetic flux densities are needed if large craft {{have to be}} turned very fast. This either necessitates a very high current in the coils, or much higher ambient flux densities than are available in Earth orbit. Subsequently, the torques provided are very limited and only serve to accelerate or decelerate the change in a spacecraft's attitude by minute amounts.
