50|$|The PRB M3A1 variant has two {{secondary}} fuze wells, and {{is often}} deployed with a M30 <b>anti-lift</b> <b>device.</b> The M30 fuze detonates the mine if it is lifted more than 3 cm. It is also a minimum metal mine, with the only metal components being two spring steel wire strikers and two aluminium percussion caps.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The typical {{configuration}} of anti-handling devices used with M15 anti-tank landmines. The upper diagram shows a pull-fuze screwed into a secondary fuze {{well in the}} side of the mine. Additionally, an M5 <b>anti-lift</b> <b>device</b> has been screwed into another fuze well, hidden under the mine. An inexperienced deminer might detect and render safe the pull-fuze, but then be killed when he lifted the mine, triggering the M5 pressure-release firing device underneath. The lower diagram shows two anti-tank landmines connected by a cord attached to the upper mine's carrying handle. The cord is attached to a pull fuze installed in a secondary fuze well in the bottom mine.|$|E

5000|$|The M63 has an <b>anti-lifting</b> <b>device,</b> {{attempting}} {{to pull the}} mine {{out of the ground}} will result in pressure on the stakes prongs, triggering the mine.|$|R
50|$|The mine can {{be fitted}} with two main fuzes, the RO-5 and the RO-9 fuse. The RO-5 fuse may be fitted with an RO-3 <b>anti-lifting</b> <b>device,</b> which will trigger the mine {{if it was}} raised.|$|R
5000|$|The mine has a {{secondary}} fuze well for an <b>anti-lifting</b> <b>device</b> and a mechanical anti-handling device was also produced for the mine, {{although this is}} reported to have never been used. The mine is currently being phased out of service with the British army. The mine is found in Afghanistan, Angola, Cyprus, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Lebanon, Libya, Namibia, Oman, Somalia, and Zambia.|$|R
50|$|The MKT Mod 72 is an Albanian circular, metal-cased {{anti-tank}} blast mine, {{a copy of}} the Russian TM-46. Two {{versions of}} the mine are produced, the PX designated version of the mine is fitted with a secondary fuze well in the base of the mine that accepts an MUV type <b>anti-lifting</b> <b>device.</b> The mine uses a mechanical pressure fuze similar to the Russian MV-5.|$|R
