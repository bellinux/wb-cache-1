5000|$|Hexokinase 3 {{also known}} as HK3 is an enzyme which in humans is encoded by the HK2 gene on {{chromosome}} 5. Hexokinases phosphorylate glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), {{the first step in}} most glucose metabolism pathways. This gene encodes hexokinase 3. Similar to hexokinases 1 and 2, this <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzyme</b> is inhibited by its product glucose-6-phosphate. by RefSeq, Apr 2009 ...|$|E
5000|$|The kinetic {{properties}} of <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzymes</b> are often {{explained in terms}} of a conformational change between a low-activity, low-affinity [...] "tense" [...] or T state and a high-activity, high-affinity [...] "relaxed" [...] or R state. These structurally distinct enzyme forms have been shown to exist in several known <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzymes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Whereas enzymes without coupled domains/subunits display normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics, most <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzymes</b> have {{multiple}} coupled domains/subunits and show cooperative binding. Generally speaking, such cooperativity results in <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzymes</b> displaying a sigmoidal {{dependence on the}} concentration of their substrates in positively cooperative systems. This allows most <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzymes</b> to greatly vary catalytic output in response to small changes in effector concentration. Effector molecules, {{which may be the}} substrate itself (homotropic effectors) or some other small molecule (heterotropic effector), may cause the enzyme to become more active or less active by redistributing the ensemble between the higher affinity and lower affinity states. The binding sites for heterotropic effectors, called allosteric sites, are usually separate from the active site yet thermodynamically coupled. Allosteric Database (ASD, http://mdl.shsmu.edu.cn/ASD) [...] provides a central resource for the display, search and analysis of the structure, function and related annotation for allosteric molecules, including <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzymes</b> and their modulators. Each enzyme is annotated with detailed description of allostery, biological process and related diseases, and each modulator with binding affinity, physicochemical properties and therapeutic area.|$|R

5000|$|Glycogen {{phosphorylase}} was {{the first}} <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzyme</b> to be discovered. This accomplishment {{was one of many}} landmark achievements made by Carl and Gerty Cori. In 1943, with the help of Arda Green, the pair illustrated that glycogen phosphorylase existed in either the [...] or b forms depending on its phosphorylation state, {{as well as in the}} R or T states based on the presences of AMP.|$|E
50|$|The {{reactions}} {{which is}} the formation of 5'-phosphoribosyalamine from glutamine and PRPP catalysed by PRPP amino transferase is the site point for purine synthesis.The enzyme is an <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzyme,</b> {{so it can be}} converted from IMP, GMP and AMP in high concentration binds the enzyme to exerts inhibition while PRPP is in large amount binds to the enzyme which causes activation So IMP, GMP and AMP are inhibitors while PRPP is an activator. Between the formation of 5'-phosphoribosyl, aminoimidazole and IMP, there is no known regulation step.|$|E
50|$|PFK1 is an <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzyme</b> whose {{activity}} {{can be described}} using the symmetry model of allosterism whereby there is a concerted transition from an enzymatically inactive T-state to the active R-state. F6P binds with a high affinity to the R state but not the T state enzyme. For every molecule of F6P that binds to PFK1, the enzyme progressively shifts from T state to the R state. Thus a graph plotting PFK1 activity against increasing F6P concentrations would adopt the sigmoidal curve shape traditionally associated with allosteric enzymes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Allosteric</b> <b>enzymes</b> are {{generally}} larger in mass than other enzymes. Different {{from having a}} single subunit enzyme, in this case they are composed of multiple subunits, which contain active sites and regulatory molecule binding sites.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{allostery}} in which macromolecules switch between two different conformations {{is a central}} theme in biological processes ranging from gene regulation to cell signaling to enzymology. <b>Allosteric</b> <b>enzymes</b> pervade metabolic processes, yet a simple and unified treatment {{of the effects of}} allostery in enzymes has been lacking. In this work, we take a step toward this goal by modeling <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzymes</b> and their interaction with two key molecular players—allosteric regulators and competitive inhibitors. We then apply this model to characterize existing data on enzyme activity, comment on how enzyme parameters (such as substrate binding affinity) can be experimentally tuned, and make novel predictions on how to control phenomena such as substrate inhibition...|$|R
50|$|They include <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzymes</b> that {{catalyze}} {{the production}} of glucose-1-phosphate from a glucan such as glycogen, starch or maltodextrin. Phosphorylase is also a common name used for glycogen phosphorylase in honor of Earl W. Sutherland Jr. who in the late 1930s discovered the first phosphorylase.|$|R
50|$|The {{negative}} signaling by FcγRIIB {{is mainly}} important for regulation of activated B cells. The positive B cell signaling is initiated by binding of foreign antigen to surface immunoglobulin. The same antigen-specific antibody is secreted {{and it can}} feedback-suppress, or promote negative signaling. This negative signaling is being provided by FcγRIIB.: Experiments using B cell deletion mutants and dominant-negative enzymes have firmly established an important role for SH2-domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase (SHIP) in negative signaling. Negative signaling through SHIP appears to inhibit the Ras pathway through SH2 domain competition with Grb2 and Shc and may involve consumption of intracellular lipid mediators that act as <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzyme</b> activators or that promote entry of extracellular Ca2+.|$|E
5000|$|Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} regulatory enzymes (...) of glycolysis. It is an <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzyme</b> made of 4 subunits and controlled by many activators and inhibitors. PFK-1 catalyzes the important [...] "committed" [...] step of glycolysis, the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate and ATP to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and ADP. Glycolysis is the foundation for respiration, both anaerobic and aerobic. Because phosphofructokinase (PFK) catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation to convert fructose-6-phosphate into fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and ADP, it {{is one of the}} key regulatory and rate limiting steps of glycolysis. PFK is able to regulate glycolysis through allosteric inhibition, and in this way, the cell can increase or decrease the rate of glycolysis in response to the cell's energy requirements. For example, a high ratio of ATP to ADP will inhibit PFK and glycolysis. The key difference between the regulation of PFK in eukaryotes and prokaryotes is that in eukaryotes PFK is activated by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. The purpose of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is to supersede ATP inhibition, thus allowing eukaryotes to have greater sensitivity to regulation by hormones like glucagon and insulin.|$|E

Lipscomb, Jr. in the chemistry department at Harvard University where he focused on the large <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzyme</b> aspartate carbamoyltransferase.In 1991, he {{accepted a}} tenure-track position at the University of California, Berkeley in the chemistry department with a joint appointment in neurobiology. His initial research as an assistant professor focused on structural neurobiology and immunology, combining chemistry, structural biology and protein chemistry with a specific biological interest in understanding how the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily works. A seminal collaboration for Stevens was with Professor Peter G. Schultz where they jointly published a series of Science and Nature papers describing the immunological evolution of antibodies through careful structural studies. In 1999, Stevens left Berkeley to take a tenured position at The Scripps Research Institute. While at The Scripps Research Institute, Stevens has helped to found and establish the Joint Center for Structural Genomics, Joint Center for Innovative Membrane Protein Technologies, and the GPCR Network, all funded by the National Institutes of Health with direct guidance from NIGMS. In 2012, Stevens was recruited to found the iHuman Institute at ShanghaiTech University. In 2014, Stevens moved his lab from The Scripps Research Institute to the University of Southern California, where he is currently the Provost Professor of Biological Sciences and Chemistry and he founded the Bridge Institute to converge the arts and sciences.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Allosteric</b> <b>enzymes</b> are {{enzymes that}} change their {{conformational}} ensemble upon binding of an effector, {{which results in}} an apparent change in binding affinity at a different ligand binding site. This [...] "action at a distance" [...] through binding of one ligand affecting the binding of another at a distinctly different site, {{is the essence of}} the allosteric concept. Allostery plays a crucial role in many fundamental biological processes, including but not limited to cell signaling and the regulation of metabolism. <b>Allosteric</b> <b>enzymes</b> need not be oligomers as previously thought, and in fact many systems have demonstrated allostery within single enzymes.In biochemistry, allosteric regulation (or allosteric control) is the regulation of a protein by binding an effector molecule at a site other than the enzyme's active site.|$|R
40|$|Strong diffusional {{mixing and}} short {{delivery}} times typical for micrometer and sub-micrometer reaction volumes {{lead to a}} special situation where the turnover times of individual enzyme molecules become the largest characteristic time scale of the chemical kinetics.

30|$|Phosphofructokinase (PFK), an <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzyme,</b> is {{responsible}} for glycolytic oscillations. PFK can lead to instabilities beyond which a new state can be organized in time and in space [78]. A positive feedback {{is responsible}} for periodic behavior. These far-from-equilibrium oscillatory mechanisms come {{within the field of}} dissipative structures initially described by Illia Prigogine [79]. Elevated PFK- 1 activity is characteristic of cancer cells and is induced in response to oncogenes [80].|$|E
50|$|Biosynthetic {{pathways}} {{are often}} highly regulated such that building-blocks are synthesized only when supplies are low. Very often, a {{high concentration of}} the final product of a pathway inhibits the activity of enzymes that function early in the pathway. Often present are <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzymes</b> capable of sensing and responding to concentrations of regulatory species. These enzymes are similar in functional properties to aspartate transcarbamoylase and its regulators. Feedback and allosteric mechanisms ensure that all twenty amino acids are maintained in sufficient amounts for protein synthesis and other processes.|$|R
40|$|The {{steady-state}} kinetics of {{the reaction}} catalyzed by glycogen phosphorylase b from rabbit skeletal muscles has been studied {{in a wide range}} of the concentrations of adenosine 5 ′-monophosphate in the direction of glycogen synthesis under the conditions of saturation of the enzyme by glycogen. The kinetic model has been proposed to describe the bell-shaped dependence of the initial rate of the enzymatic reaction on the concentration of adenosine 5 ′-monophosphate. The parameters of the equation for the initial rate of the enzymatic reaction are calculated by the nonlinear regression method. The conformational transitions in the glycogen phosphorylase b molecule compatible with the proposed kinetic mechanism are discussed. A distinguishing feature of the <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzymes</b> is an existence of the distinct spatially separated site, in which the binding of the allosteric effector occurs. <b>Allosteric</b> <b>enzymes,</b> as a rule, consist of two or more subunits and have at least two catalytic and two allosteric sites [1]. One of the approaches to elucidation of the mechanism of the site interaction in the enzyme molecule is the study of the kinetic mechanism of allosteric regulation of the enzymatic activity. Glycogen phosphorylase (1, 4 -α-D-glucan: orthophosphate glycosyltransferase, EC 2. 4. 1. 1) catalyzes the reversible phosphorolytic splitting off the terminal glycose residues of the polysaccharide chains of glycogen in the form of α-D-glucose 1 -phosphate...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{cells can}} be viewed as {{networks}} formed by molecular machines. The coordination in operations of individual machines in such networks is not externally imposed, but develops internally as a result of interactions between the machines, through a self-organization process. As an example, we consider a population of <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzymes</b> with product activation and show that this network can undergo spontaneous transitions to different synchronous regimes corresponding to just-in-time production. Analyzing a toy model of cross-coupled neural networks, we find furthermore that similar synchronization transitions are possible when the dynamics of individual elements is highly complex...|$|R

When the concentrations of the chemicals are fixed at the boundaries, dynamic dissipative structures are shown to arise in the form of propagating concentration waves. The model is applied to the phosphofructokinase reaction and suggests that a spatiotemporal organization may originate at a macroscopic (supracellular) level from the glycolytic system...|$|E

40|$|Monovalent-cation-activated enzymes are abundantly {{represented}} in plants {{and in the}} animal world. Most of these enzymes are specifically activated by K+, whereas {{a few of them}} show preferential activation by Na+. The monovalent cation specificity of these enzymes remains elusive in molecular terms and has not been reengineered by site-directed mutagenesis. Here we demonstrate that thrombin, a Na+-activated <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzyme</b> involved in vertebrate blood clotting, can be converted into a K+-specific enzyme by redesigning a loop that shapes the entrance to the cation-binding site. The conversion, however, does not result into a K+-activated enzyme...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} aspect of understanding protein allostery, and of artificial effector design, is the characterization and prediction of substrate- and effector-binding sites. To find binding sites in <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzymes,</b> {{many of which are}} oligomeric with allosteric sites at domain interfaces, we devise a local centrality measure for residue interaction graphs, which behaves well for both small/monomeric and large/multimeric proteins. The measure is purely structure based and has a clear geometrical interpretation and no free parameters. It is not biased towards typically catalytic residues, a property that is crucial when looking for non-catalytic effector sites, which are potent drug targets...|$|R
40|$|An {{allosteric}} ribozyme {{has been}} designed using the hammerhead ribozyme as the active site and aflavin-specific RNA aptamer as a regulatory site. We constructed six variants {{with a series of}} base pairs in the linker region (stem II). Under single turnover conditions, kinetic studies were carried out in the absence and presence of flavin mononucleotide (FMN). Interestingly, FMN addition did not influence the cleavage rate of constructs with a 5 - 6 bp linker but stimulated the catalytic activity of those bearing a shorter linker. In particular, the apparent k cat of Rz 3 increases by approximately 10 -fold upon addition of saturating amounts of FMN. To determine the rate constants(K m 4 and k cat), the ribozyme regulated most effectively by FMN was further investigated. FMN mainly affected the k cat value, reflecting the rate limiting conformational change step of the overall cleavage reaction, depending on helix formation in stem II. Probably, FMN influences the orientation of structures necessary for the cleavage reaction through stem II formation. The result of chemical modification revealed that binding of FMN to the aptamer domain induced the helix formation in stem II required for catalytic activity. Therefore, a specific FMN-mediated allosteric interaction seems to promote a conformational alteration from an open to a closed structure in stem II. The concept of conformational modification in the allosteric effect is consistent with other <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzymes,</b> suggesting that such a conformational change is a fundamental feature of <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzymes</b> in biological systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{proteins}} with desired properties through genetic engineering is generally restricted by the mutations tolerance of the starting scaffold. Gain in thermostability {{is known to}} increase the robustness of proteins toward substitutions. With the aim of generating <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzymes</b> selectable by phage display, we managed to highly improve the tolerance of a TEM- 1 β-lactamase toward loop insertional mutagenesis upon stabilization. A highly diverse collection of mutants endowed with complex potential binding sites was built by insertion of random peptides and mutations in three contiguous surface loops near the active site. Stabilization {{increased the number of}} active triple mutants (6. 6 x 107) by 70 fold. The gain in stability also abolished the requirement for a stabilizing disulfide bridge in the degenerated N-terminal loop. This increase in diversity is believed to promote the selection of clones with new binding abilities that might predispose the protein to exhibit allosteric effects. Twelve clones recognizing nickel were selected by phage display and 25 % of them showed allosteric regulation upon metal ions binding. The enzyme prestabilization along with a possible stiffening of the scaffold did not seem to alter the selection of allosteric clones. Besides, the insertions of the stabilizing mutations in a previously described allosteric clone activated by aminoglycosides had no impact on the regulation properties of the enzyme. These results validate the choice of the stabilized TEM- 1 β-lactamase as a scaffold for engineering <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzymes.</b> (BIOL 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R

Thus, the same enzyme exhibits negative cooperativity for GTP (an effector) and glutamine (a substrate) and positive cooperativity for ATP and UTP (both substrates). In {{the process of the}} delineation of these phenomena, diagnostic procedures for negative cooperativity were developed. Application of these procedures to other enzymes indicates that negative cooperativity is a characteristic of many of them.

Biosensors use tissues, whole cells, artificial membranes or cell components like proteins or nucleic acids as receptors, coupled to a physicochemical signal transducer. <b>Allosteric</b> <b>enzymes</b> exhibit a catalytic activity that is modulated by specific effectors, through binding to receptor sites that are distinct from the active site.

The regulation of the activation of these catalyzing enzymes is needed in order to regulate the whole reaction speed, so {{that it is possible to}} obtain the amount of product required at any time, that makes regulatory enzymes have a biological importance. Therefore, regulatory enzymes, by its controlled activation and are of two types: <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzymes</b> and covalently modulated enzymes; however, an enzyme can combine both types of regulation.|$|R
40|$|Enzymes and ribozymes {{constitute}} two biological catalysts. The {{activity of}} many natural enzymes is {{regulated by the}} binding of ligands that have different structures than their substrates; these ligands are consequently called allosteric effectors. In most <b>allosteric</b> <b>enzymes,</b> the <b>allosteric</b> binding site lies {{far away from the}} active site. This implies that communication pathways, must exist between these sites. While mechanisms of allosteric regulation were developed more than forty years ago, they continue to be revisited regularly. The improved understanding of these mechanisms has led {{in the past two decades}} to projects to transform several unregulated enzymes into allosterically regulated ones either by rational design or directed evolution techniques. More recently, ribozymes have also been the object of similar successful engineering efforts. in this., review, after briefly summarising recent progress in the theories of allosteric regulation, several strategies to engineer <b>allosteric</b> regulations in <b>enzymes</b> and ribozymes are described and compared.
