500|$|... "I'm {{often asked}} 'has {{federation}} turned out as you expected?' Well yes and no. By and large {{the sort of}} thing we expected has happened but with differences. We knew the constitution was not perfect; {{it had to be a}} compromise with all the faults of a compromise... But, in spite of the unforeseen [...] strains and stresses, the constitution has worked, on the whole, much <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it would. I think it now needs revision, to meet the needs of a changed world. But no-one could wish the work undone, who tries to imagine, what, in these stormy days, would have been the plight of six disunited Australian colonies." ...|$|E
500|$|Lillywhite {{believed}} that the African influences had not translated well onto the album, remarking: [...] "It's a pity because {{the whole idea of}} Morocco as a big idea was great. When the big idea for U2 is good, that is when they succeed the most, but I don't think the spirit of what they set out to achieve was translated. Something happened that meant it did not come across on the record." [...] The Edge concurred, admitting that the group erred by [...] "starting out experimental and then trying to bring it into something that was more accessible". He added, [...] "I think probably we should have said, 'It's an experimental work. That's what it is.'" [...] Mullen refers to the album as [...] "No Craic on the Horizon" [...] and said, [...] "It was pretty fucking miserable. It turns out that we're not as good <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> we were and things got in the way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Japan's naked {{shorting}} ban {{started on}} November 4, 2008, and was originally scheduled to run until July 2009, but was extended through October of that year. Japan's Finance Minister, Shōichi Nakagawa stated, [...] "We decided (to {{move up the}} short-selling ban) <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it could be dangerous for the Tokyo stock market {{if we do not}} take action immediately." [...] Nakagawa added that Japan's Financial Services Agency would be teaming with the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission and Tokyo Stock Exchange to investigate past violations of Japanese regulations on stock short-selling. The ban was subsequently extended through October 2010.|$|E

5000|$|<b>We</b> gave much <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> to whom <b>we</b> should invite <b>as</b> speaker. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> {{wanted to}} have a typical great man {{representative}} of Rugby Football, so we came to Aspatria and invited the president Mr Bob Hanvey to Corpus Christi College, and no-one could have spoken better." ...|$|R
5000|$|Harry Cole, {{leader of}} the party stated his party was named as such because [...] "with the {{coalition}} treating the electorate <b>as</b> zombies, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> we’d illustrate the strength of feeling by bringing our cause direct to Parliament".|$|R
2500|$|Bartholomew Gosnold {{explored}} the harbor in 1602, and his mate Gabriel Archer wrote: [...] "The fifteenth day of May we had again {{sight of the}} land, which made ahead, being <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> an island, by reason of a large sound that appeared westward {{between it and the}} main, for coming to the west end thereof, we did perceive a large opening, we called it Shoal Hope. Near this cape we came to anchor in fifteen fathoms, where we took great store of codfish, for which we altered the name, and called it Cape Cod. Here we saw sculls of herring, mackerel, and other small fish, in great abundance. This is a low sandy shoal, but without danger..." ...|$|E
60|$|MAGGIE [that {{sense of}} justice again]. I think you should let the young man explain. It mayn't be so bad <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|E
60|$|Accordingly, we ranged {{the valley}} round, high and low, {{until we had}} visited, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought,</b> {{every nook and cranny}} in it and then, much dispirited, {{returned}} home.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I do {{not like}} calling {{servants}} by anything but their true names,' answered Albinia; 'it {{does not seem to}} me treating them with proper respect to change their names, <b>as</b> if <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> them too good for them. It is using them like slaves.|$|R
5000|$|Talking {{about the}} song, Babydaddy stated: [...] "It's a song we had fun making so while it wasn't {{necessarily}} true to {{the direction of}} the album or what most people might think of <b>as</b> Scissors, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> {{it would be good to}} just get out there in between albums." ...|$|R
60|$|SMITH. After {{the melancholy}} games of last night, Deakin, {{which no one}} deplores so much <b>as</b> George Smith, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> we'd trot round--didn't us, Hump?--and see how you and your bankers was a-getting on.|$|R
6000|$|Now I come {{to think}} it over, was that young man as dense-headed <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought?</b> or was he—no, impossible! {{there was such a}} simple, child-like {{expression}} about him! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought,</b> Doctor; {{we are in}} {{the middle}} of that thicket. Now I will go and dress if you will keep guard here with your rifle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's too bad; {{and just}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> our fifteen or sixteen {{thousand}} dollars {{of the amount}} was safe. I wonder what the bank people at home will say now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... § 29. The {{thing that}} must first strike {{us in this}} respect, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> turn our <b>thoughts</b> to the poem, is, unquestionably, the {{formality}} of its landscape.|$|R
60|$|Now, my father, {{for awhile}} we were silent and {{alone in the}} hut, and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> sat I <b>thought</b> I heard a rat stir in the thatch.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good by, Handel!" [...] Herbert {{called out}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> started. I <b>thought</b> what a blessed fortune it was, {{that he had}} found another name for me than Pip.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{distance}} {{is not quite}} so far <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it was. It was a thirty miles' march, and two sixties. We attacked them at daybreak, {{on the third day}} after leaving." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think Magdalen {{is feeling}} the reaction, after yesterday," [...] said Mrs. Vanstone, quietly. [...] "It is just <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought.</b> Now the {{theatrical}} amusements are all over, she is fretting for more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I expect to, but it isn't {{going to}} be so easy <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought.</b> The owner of the ship has sent his son to watch me, and he and those other lads are rather clever." ...|$|E
6000|$|THE ARCHDEACON. O Mammon, Mammon! I am punished now for bowing {{the knee}} to him. Is there {{nothing left of}} your settlement? Fifty {{thousand}} dollars a year it secured to you, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> all <b>thought.</b> Only half the securities could be called speculative. The other half were gilt-edged. What has become of it all? ...|$|R
40|$|A case of {{ipsilateral}} pelvic transitional {{cell carcinoma}} and {{renal cell carcinoma}} (RCC), in an 82 -year-old male is presented. We diagnosed this case as pelvic tumor preoperatively with retrograde pyelography and computed tomography. Operatively renal tumor was found and diagnosed <b>as</b> RCC. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> it difficult to diagnose as RCC preoperatively. To date, this case is the 13 th reported case diagnosed clinically...|$|R
6000|$|... "The truth is, Uncle Prosper, that we {{have all}} felt {{that we have}} been in your black books; and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have not <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> {{deserved}} it, there has been a little coolness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} what I think we had better do?" [...] {{returned}} the young major. [...] "Let's stop Brassy and have a straight talk with him. I don't think he's quite as bad <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> he might be." ...|$|E
6000|$|Thora had {{begged for}} a further {{allowance}} of beer for them, or even to broach a cask of wine. [...] "For," [...] said she, [...] "they are none such fiends <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought,</b> if one knows how to take them courteously." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That only {{shows that}} we are not as near the island <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought.</b> But it won't be long of--See! There it comes," [...] said the hermit. [...] "Now, Winnie, cling to my arm and put your trust in God." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As hard, but scarce as dexterously," [...] said Friedel, [...] "and {{be called}} for our pains the wild {{mountain}}eers. I heard the men-at-arms saying I sat my horse {{as though it}} were always going up or down a precipice; and Master Schmidt went into his shop the other day shrugging his shoulders, and saying we hailed one another across the market-place <b>as</b> if <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> Ulm was a mountain full of gemsbocks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She'll {{never do}} that," [...] said the mother. [...] "Lottie says Ellen thinks he's just perfect. He cheers her up, and takes {{her out of}} herself. We've always acted with her <b>as</b> if <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> she was {{different}} from other girls, and he behaves to {{her as if she}} was just like all of them, just as silly, and just as weak, and it pleases her, and flatters her; she likes it." ...|$|R
40|$|A 29 -year-old {{pregnant}} woman with recurrent pericardial effusion and a cardiac tumor, diagnosed as an angiosarcoma, {{was treated with}} surgical resection of the tumor followed by radiotherapy. Immediately after completion of radiotherapy, she developed bilateral breast masses, which were also confirmed <b>as</b> angiosarcomas. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> {{this might be the}} first case of bilateral angiosarcoma of the breast metastasizing to heart mimicking a primary cardiac angiosarcoma, although we could not conclude with certainty that angiosarcoma of the heart was not the primary site...|$|R
60|$|We {{stood still}} with pale faces {{and stared at}} each other, the lantern {{in the middle and}} the glimmering gems below, as though we were conspirators about to commit a crime, instead of being, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought,</b> the most {{fortunate}} men on earth.|$|E
60|$|We {{thought this}} a very humorous answer {{on the part}} of the boy at first, and {{somebody}} gave him twopence as a reward for his ready wit; but when he persisted in keeping up the joke, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought,</b> too long, we got vexed with him.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have come}} out, Maria," [...] Bertie called. [...] "The coast is clear for you. The water {{is not so}} deep <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> it was, and you can walk out {{to the point where}} the roof comes down on to the water without getting out of your depth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. We and our {{families}} have received great indignities from the Boers; {{and although we}} are conscious {{that we should be}} of little use <b>as</b> troops, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> could do service as scouts on our own account, and have been lucky in inflicting some blows on them. I was fortunate enough to attract Colonel Yule's attention at Dundee, and he furnished me with an open letter addressed to you, and to officers commanding stations, saying that we had done so." ...|$|R
30|$|From our research, {{the notion}} of culture has been {{improved}} a lot. It is not <b>as</b> simple <b>as</b> <b>we</b> originally <b>thought.</b> There are {{many different ways of}} living, beliefs, and core values, and what we witness cannot fully express the culture of a group or an organization. If we want to understand explicitly what culture is, we must get to know the backgrounds and histories of the insiders from that cultures, as well as subcultures.|$|R
