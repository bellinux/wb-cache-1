2500|$|Aminoallyl {{nucleotide}} is a nucleotide with {{a modified}} base containing an <b>allylamine.</b> They {{are used in}} post-labeling of nucleic acids by fluorescence detection in microarray. They are reactive with N-Hydroxysuccinimide ester group which helps attach a fluorescent dye to the primary amino group on the nucleotide. These nucleotides are known as 5-(3-aminoallyl)-nucleotides since the aminoallyl group is usually attached to carbon 5 of the pyrimidine ring of uracil or cytosine. The primary amine group in the aminoallyl moiety is aliphatic and thus more reactive compared to the amine groups that are directly attached to the rings (aromatic) of the bases. Common names of aminoallyl nucleosides are initially abbreviated with aa- or AA- to indicate aminoallyl. The 5-carbon sugar is indicated {{with or without the}} lowercase [...] "d" [...] indicating deoxyribose if included or ribose if not. Finally the nitrogenous base and number of phosphates are indicated (i.e. aa-UTP = aminoallyl uridine triphosphate).|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} and synthesise {{the evidence for}} efficacy and cost effectiveness of topical treatments for superficial fungal infections of the skin and nails of the feet. DESIGN: Systematic review. INTERVENTIONS: Topical treatments for superficial fungal infections. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cure confirmed by culture and microscopy for skin and by culture for nails in patients with clinically diagnosed fungal infections. RESULTS: Of 126 trials identified in 121 papers, 72 (57. 1 %) met the inclusion criteria. Placebo controlled trials yielded pooled relative risks of failure to cure skin infections: <b>allylamines</b> (0. 30, 95 % confidence interval 0. 24 to 0. 38); azoles (0. 54, 0. 42 to 0. 68); undecenoic acid (0. 28, 0. 11 to 0. 74); and tolnaftate (0. 46, 0. 17 to 1. 22). Although meta-analysis of 11 trials comparing <b>allylamines</b> and azoles showed a relative risk of failure to cure of 0. 88 (0. 78 to 0. 99) in favour of <b>allylamines,</b> there was evidence of language bias. Seven reports in English favoured <b>allylamines</b> (0. 79, 0. 69 to 0. 91), but four reports in foreign languages showed {{no difference between the}} two drugs (1. 01, 0. 90 to 1. 13). Neither trial of nail infections showed significant differences between alternative topical treatments. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Allylamines,</b> azoles, and undecenoic acid were efficacious in placebo controlled trials. There are sufficient comparative trials to judge relative efficacy only between <b>allylamines</b> and azoles. <b>Allylamines</b> cure slightly more infections than azoles but are much more expensive than azoles. The most cost effective strategy is first to treat with azoles or undecenoic acid and to use <b>allylamines</b> only if that fails...|$|R
