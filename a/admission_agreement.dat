40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{proportion}} of emergency department (ED) attendances that would be suitable for primary care and the inter-rater reliability of general practitioner (GP) assessment of primary care suitability. DESIGN OF STUDY: Survey of GPs' agreement of suitability for primary care on a random anonymised sample of all ED patients attending over a 1 -month period. SETTING: ED of a UK Hospital serving a population of 600 000. METHOD: Four GPs independently used data extracted from clinical notes to rate the appropriateness for management in primary care as well as need for investigations, specialist review or <b>admission.</b> <b>Agreement</b> was assessed using Cohen's κ. RESULTS: The mean percentage of patients that GPs considered suitable for primary care management was 43 % (range 38 - 47 %). The κ for agreement was 0. 54 (95 % CI 0. 44 to 0. 64) and 0. 47 (95 % CI 0. 38 to 0. 59). In patients deemed not suitable for primary care, GPs {{were more likely to}} determine the need for specialist review (relative risks (RR) = 3. 5, 95 % CI 3. 0 to 4. 2, p< 0. 001) and admission (RR= 3. 9, 95 % CI 3. 2 to 4. 7, p< 0. 001). In patients assessed as suitable for primary care, GPs would initiate investigations in 51 % of cases. Consensus over primary care appropriateness was higher for paediatric than for adult attenders. CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of patients attending ED could be managed by GPs, including those requiring investigations at triage. A stronger agreement among GPs over place of care may be seen for paediatric than for adult attenders. More effective signposting of patients presenting with acute or urgent problems and supporting a greater role for primary care in relieving the severe workflow pressures in ED in the UK are potential solutions...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{admission}} of guilt has always had an attenuation effect on the punishment, meant to encourage the persons which have committed a crime to admit their deeds and {{to cooperate with the}} authorities in order to find out the truth of the case. In the last years, the legislator has used the {{admission of}} guilt to obtain a diminution of the duration of the trials and a relief of the courts of law. The Law no 202 / 2010 known as Small Reform Law has brought a simplified procedure for judgment the cases regarding the defendants which admit their deeds. The new settlement was a success, the procedure being used quite often. The new Criminal Procedure Code comes with a new regulation also known in other legislations as Plea bargaining. The simplified procedure for judgment is also stipulated. That is why we have to ask if <b>admission</b> guilt <b>agreement</b> has a change to succeed in our legislation and {{to be used in the}} legal practice or is meant to fall into disuse ab initio.

We find that FDI reacts positively to RTAs only if they offer liberal admission rules. Dispute settlement provisions play a minor role.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} (a) whether doctors {{involved in}} the process of emergency surgical admission could agree about which patients should be admitted, (b) whether there were consistent differences between doctors in different specialty groups, and (c) whether these opinions were greatly influenced by non-clinical factors. DESIGN: Independent assessment of summarised case histories by three "expert" clinicians (two consultant surgeons and one general practitioner (GP)), by a group of 10 GPs, and by a group of 10 junior and senior surgeons. Experts, but not other observers, scored admissions both independently and as a consensus group. Observers indicated for each patient whether they would admit, would not admit, or were unsure. SETTING: An urban general hospital with teaching status. SUBJECTS: Fifty consecutive patients admitted to the general surgical unit as emergencies during 1995. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of admissions considered unnecessary or uncertain: agreement between observers on these proportions: effect of social and procedural factors on the admission decision. RESULTS: Between 8 and 34 % of admissions were considered unnecessary and 20 - 38 % of unclear necessity. Agreement between the groups of clinicians was not good. GPs and consultant surgeons showed the poorest agreement (kappa = 0. 08 to 0. 25, 4 comparisons), and the GPs scored a higher percentage of admissions as unnecessary (34 v 8 - 12 %). After discussion, the consensus group achieved good to very good agreement (kappa 0. 61 - 0. 84).

30|$|Multivariate {{analysis}} {{in this study}} showed that satisfactory outcome was inversely associated with old age, history of hypertension, and severity of stroke at admission. Severity of stroke at <b>admission</b> was in <b>agreement</b> with multiple studies in a systematic review (Counsell and Dennis 2001), as well as increasing age as a predictor of unsatisfactory outcome (Hier and Edelstein 1991; Kwakkel et al. 1996). However, older age appeared protective for longer term survival while vascular risk factors such as hypertension appeared to have little effect (Counsell and Dennis 2001). It is possible that risk factors for stroke survival in Africa may differ from other settings. For example, older individuals may be less likely to have an extended support system of adult care givers than their younger counter parts. Perhaps in a setting where formal healthcare is scarce, family support may be more the norm and have a protective effect in stroke recovery. More information is needed, especially concerning the influence of social demographics on stroke outcome in addition to many other predictor variables (Counsell and Dennis 2001; Hier and Edelstein 1991; Kwakkel et al. 1996).|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to discuss why the European Community decided to {{integrate}} admission policies toward immigrants in the Treaty on European Union (TEU) in 1991. Immigration represents a complex policy field in the Community, and co-operation has proved difficult. From {{the last half of}} the 1980 s, there was general agreement that co-operation was necessary. However, there were strong disagreements concerning the actual content of this co-operation. At the Maastricht summit in December 1991, the states agreed upon a complex compromise: visa policies became part of the supranational co-operation in the Community. Asylum and external border policies were placed in a new piller, called the Third Pillar. Its area of responsibility was co-operation in justice and home affairs in the Union. In these policy fields the member states still enjoyed national sovereignity. My intention with the thesis is two-fold. First of all, I discuss why the member states actually agreed to include these policy areas in the framework of the Community. Secondly, I seek to identify factors that might explain the content of the final compromise. The analysis concentrates on the period from the Single European Act negotiations, starting in 1985, to the Maastricht surnmit in 1991. I focus on three member states, Germany, the United Kingdom and France. I base my research on two theoretical schools in the literature on European integration. The intergovernmental approach focuses on the national governments, and explains integration as a result of domestic politics and interstate bargains. The neo-functionalist approach postulates that the integration process will move forward as a result of an internal dynamic inside the Community. Integration in one area creates political and functional forces necessitating integration in other sectors as well. In the analysis, two main explanations stand out as particularly crucial for the fact that the states actually agreed to integrate admission policies. The first concerns the immigration problem in the member states. New immigration flows were combined with a reduced will to receive immigrants. Simultaneously, national strategies to control the borders failed, and immigration emerged as an international problem. This caused a shift in the interests of the member states in favour of integration. A second main explanation concerns the Single European Act. Its aim to create an internal market with free movement of persons, would imply an abolishment of the internal frontiers. This made common policies at the external borders necessary. Behind the complexity of the agreement, is the composition of national interests, combined with the interstate bargains prior to the Maastricht summit. It was mainly the opposing positions of Germany and the United Kingdom that accounted for the character of the agreement. The strong disagreements resulted in a compromise that complied with some of the requests of both countries. The fact that the solution was, with the exception of visa policy, intergovernmental, must be seen as a result of British opposition to any form of supranational admission policy co-operation. Supranational visa policies and ambitious plans for the future asylum and border policies, on the other hand, were the result of German pressure, combined with British feer of becoming isolated from future co-operation. The member states had different motives for accepting the admission policy compromise. Germany, more than any other country, needed burden sharing with respect to immigration policies. Admission policy integration was also consistent with a more general integration strategy, aiming to complete the internal market. The British government feared isolation, and had to concentrate the use of veto on other parts of the TEU. When it comes to France, the <b>admission</b> policy <b>agreement</b> harmonised with the initial preferences of the French government...|$|R
40|$|Transfer {{articulation}} is {{an important}} policy issue in Virginia. With increasing economic strains on federal and state budgets, pressure on key actors in higher education, and critical teacher shortages, an opportunity presented itself to investigate state transfer policy and articulation agreements designed to facilitate student transfer. Articulation agreements are policy instruments designed to facilitate a seamless transfer of both students and credits from the community college system into senior institutions. Over the last decade increased articulation activity {{has taken place in}} the Commonwealth of Virginia driven by higher education costs and articulation specific to teacher preparation due to teacher shortages. This study is an effort to add to the literature by linking the presence of one articulation agreement to increased enrollments of Virginia Community College System (VCCS) associate degree holders into a 5 -year teacher preparation program at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). Select academic outcomes of associate degree holders, students who took coursework in the VCCS, and native students were also examined for comparative purposes. The study engaged a quantitative, nonexperimental, cross-sectional research methodology using existing data related to the 5 -year teacher preparation program at VCU. The data collected for the study originated from the initial teacher licensure Master of Teaching (M. T.) programs which include early/elementary, and secondary (6 - 12) programs in English, foreign languages, history/social studies, mathematics, sciences, and special education. A master file containing 2, 349 observations was created from which samples were then drawn for hypotheses testing. Ordinary Least Square regression, multiple regression, and binary logistic regression were used and the results indicated the presence of the 2004 VCU/VCCS Teacher Education Provision <b>Admission</b> (TEPA) articulation <b>agreement</b> had no impact on enrollment likelihood. Earning an associate degree was a strong predictor of graduation likelihood in the teacher preparation program and associate degree holders could also expect to earn fewer cumulative hours in the program—a potential savings of time and money. Total community college credits earned was a strong predictor of teacher licensure likelihood. Race had no impact on elapsed time spent in the teacher preparation program. The findings of this study suggest the mere presence of an articulation agreement does not guarantee increased enrollments into an academic program, in this case, a 5 -year teacher preparation program. Student outcomes also suggest earning the associate degree had significant effects post transfer, almost doubling graduation likelihood. Licensing likelihood is positively affected by total community college credits earned. Results of the models testing common measures of student academic success—cumulative GPA, Praxis I performance, and GRE performance had no impact on graduation likelihood. Since the extant research is not robust on 5 -year teacher preparation programs, further research is recommended specifically on 5 -year programs related to the effectiveness of articulation agreements on enrollments—in addition to post transfer student outcomes...|$|R
