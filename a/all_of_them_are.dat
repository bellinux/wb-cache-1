5|$|The {{chlorine}} oxides are well-studied {{in spite of}} their instability (<b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> endothermic compounds).

None of them can be made from directly reacting the elements.|$|E
5|$|About twenty {{isotopes}} and six {{nuclear isomers}} (excited states of an isotope) of berkelium have been characterized with the mass numbers ranging from 235 to 254. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> radioactive. The longest half-lives are observed for 247Bk (1,380years), 248Bk (over300years) and 249Bk (330days); the half-lives {{of the other}} isotopes range from microseconds to several days. The isotope which is the easiest to synthesize is berkelium-249. This emits mostly soft β-particles which are inconvenient for detection. Its alpha radiation is rather weak – 1.45% {{with respect to the}} β-radiation – but is sometimes used to detect this isotope. The second important berkelium isotope, berkelium-247, is an alpha-emitter, as are most actinide isotopes.|$|E

5|$|There {{are five}} major {{pathways}} {{in the brain}} connecting other brain areas with the basal ganglia.

5|$|Actinides {{are typical}} metals. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> soft {{and have a}} silvery color (but tarnish in air), {{relatively}} high density and plasticity. Some {{of them can be}} cut with a knife. Their electrical resistivity varies between 15 and 150 µOhm·cm. The hardness of thorium {{is similar to that of}} soft steel, so heated pure thorium can be rolled in sheets and pulled into wire. Thorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium, but is harder than either of them. All actinides are radioactive, paramagnetic, and, with the exception of actinium, have several crystalline phases: plutonium has seven, and uranium, neptunium and californium three. The crystal structures of protactinium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more similar to those of the 3d-transition metals.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to popular}} demand from citizens, Ben restarts the youth {{basketball}} league, although {{with only two}} teams. They are coached by Ron (Nick Offerman), who is extremely strict and disciplined with his players, and Andy (Chris Pratt), who is very laid back and lets his kids go out of control. Tom (Aziz Ansari), who referees the game, becomes jealous when his ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) arrives to support Ron. Tom insists he is happy with his new girlfriend Lucy (Natalie Morales) and does not mind that Wendy is dating Ron. However, Tom repeatedly calls false fouls against Ron's players until <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> benched. When Ron and Wendy get angry, Tom ejects them from the games and declares it a forfeit, which concerns Lucy.|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} Isabella, Clear {{and the other}} realize that <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> still alive due to the Flight 180 {{survivors}} having gotten off the plane. While driving to the hospital, {{they are involved in}} a car accident that leaves Eugene needing medical help and eventually leads to the deaths of Kat and Rory. Following their deaths, Clear, Kimberly and Thomas go to the hospital to save Isabella. While they do succeed in finding her in time and ensuring her infant survives, Kimberly has another premonition that reveals to her Isabella was never meant to die in the pileup, meaning they're still in danger. Understanding the situation, Clear tries to find Eugene's room. Finding him contained by an oxygenated room, she opens the door, subsequently loosening the plug of Eugene's defibrillator, creating a spark that incinerates Eugene's room, burning her and Eugene.|$|E

5|$|Fatigue: fatigue is {{very common}} and {{disabling}} in MS, {{and at the same}} time it has a close relationship with depressive symptomatology. When depression is reduced fatigue also tends to improve, so patients should be evaluated for depression before other therapeutic approaches are used. In a similar way, other factors such as disturbed sleep, chronic pain, poor nutrition, or even some medications can contribute to fatigue; medical professionals are therefore encouraged to identify and modify them. A few medications have been studied to treat MS-related fatigue, such as amantadine pemoline (which is a psychostimulant also used for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy), or modafinil, as well as psychological interventions of energy conservation, but the effects of <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> small. Fatigue is therefore a very difficult symptom to manage for which no drugs are recommended.|$|E
5|$|The Rosetta Stone is a {{fragment}} of a larger stele. No additional fragments were found in later searches of the Rosetta site. Owing to its damaged state, {{none of the three}} texts is absolutely complete. The top register, composed of Egyptian hieroglyphs, suffered the most damage. Only the last 14 lines of the hieroglyphic text can be seen; <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> broken on the right side, and 12 of them on the left. The following register of demotic text has survived best; it has 32 lines, of which the first 14 are slightly damaged on the right side. The final register of Greek text contains 54 lines, of which the first 27 survive in full; the rest are increasingly fragmentary due to a diagonal break at the bottom right of the stone.|$|E
5|$|The project's {{finalization}} {{lasted for}} two years due to {{the intention of the}} team behind it to improve it as much as possible. According to Gočeva and the producer Micevski, the group's members' acquaintance with each other helped them in setting the right musical direction with the recording of Makedonsko Devojče 2. Musically, the album is similar to its predecessor; the songs are characterized by elements of Macedonian traditional music, but are adapted to a modern style which is contemporary {{at the time of the}} release of the album, thus intertwining pop and jazz elements. The lyrics cover emotional states of sadness, happiness, love and longing experienced by a mellow woman. The songs were written and composed specifically for Gočeva, taking into account her wide vocal range and musical versatility; <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> sang without using any backing vocals.|$|E

5|$|In a later period, the two central {{cells of}} the rear wall have been {{combined}} by breaking the partition in between to house the Ganesha image. The old entrance was also widened during the conversion to the Ganesha temple. There are two other smaller entrances to the hall. All entrances bear marks of sockets for fixing wooden doors, added during the conversion, and still have doors. The hall also has traces of plaster and paintings, both added during the conversion and renewed in later times - possibly {{as late as the}} 19th century. The Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency (1882) records that the hall was plastered and white-washed. The paintings depicted Ganesha's childhood, marriage preparations, battle with demons and so forth, along with scenes of other Hindu deities like Devi, Krishna, Vishnu and Shiva. Some of the cells fitted with wooden doors were used for storage. Nine Sati memorials were added on the left wall during the conversion, each is {{in the shape of a}} long pillar with an arched top, and to the right of each pillar a hand raised above the elbow, with an open palm, signifies Sati's blessing. While three panels were plain, the other memorials were sculpted. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> worn out, but one of them hints that its subject may be the immolation of Sati on her husband's funeral pyre.|$|E
