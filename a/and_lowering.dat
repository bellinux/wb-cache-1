5|$|Among the lanthanides, {{lanthanum}} is exceptional as it {{does not}} have any 4f electrons; indeed, the sudden contraction <b>and</b> <b>lowering</b> of energy of the 4f orbital that is important for the chemistry of the lanthanides only begins to happen at cerium. Thus it is only very weakly paramagnetic, unlike the strongly paramagnetic later lanthanides (with the exceptions of the last two, ytterbium and lutetium, where the 4f shell is completely full). Furthermore, since the melting points of the trivalent lanthanides are related to the extent of hybridisation of the 6s, 5d, and 4f electrons, lanthanum has the second-lowest (after cerium) melting point among all the lanthanides: 920°C. The lanthanides become harder as the series is traversed: as expected, lanthanum is a soft metal. Lanthanum has a relatively high resistivity of 615nΩm at room temperature; in comparison, the value for the good conductor aluminium is only 26.50nΩm. Lanthanum is the least volatile of the lanthanides. Like most of the lanthanides, lanthanum has a hexagonal crystal structure at room temperature. At 310°C, lanthanum changes to a face-centered cubic structure, and at 865°C, it changes to a body-centered cubic structure.|$|E

5|$|Since the redevelopments to Celtic Park and Hampden Park were {{completed}} in the late 1990s, Ibrox has had the smallest capacity {{of the three major}} stadiums in Glasgow. Rangers have since explored options to increase capacity. After opening the Bar 72 area in 2006, chief executive Martin Bain said that the scheme could be replicated in the Copland Stand. A report in the Daily Record in April 2007 claimed that Rangers were planning to increase capacity to 57,000, principally by removing the JumboTron screens <b>and</b> <b>lowering</b> the pitch to accommodate more seating. These plans were said to be dependent for finance upon improved performance by the team. In January 2008, Rangers announced that they were investigating three options to further develop Ibrox. One of the proposals would have resulted in a capacity of 70,000, by replacing three of the stands with a bowl-type structure. These plans were shelved by October 2008, however, due to the late-2000s financial crisis.|$|E
5|$|The hot-Jupiters and warm-Jupiters {{are thought}} to have {{migrated}} to their current orbits during or following their formation. A number of possible mechanisms for this migration have been proposed. Type I or Type II migration could smoothly decrease the semimajor axis of the planet's orbit resulting in a warm- or hot-Jupiter. Gravitational scattering by other planets onto eccentric orbits with a perihelion near the star followed by the circularization of its orbit due to tidal interactions with the star can leave a planet on a close orbit. If a massive companion planet or star on an inclined orbit was present an exchange of inclination for eccentricity via the Kozai mechanism raising eccentricities <b>and</b> <b>lowering</b> perihelion followed by circularization can also result in a close orbit. Many of the Jupiter sized planets have eccentric orbits which may indicate that gravitational encounters occurred between the planets, although migration while in resonance can also excite eccentricities. The in situ growth of hot Jupiters from closely orbiting super Earths has also been proposed. The cores in this hypothesis could have formed locally or at a greater distance and migrated close to the star.|$|E

5|$|The power {{struggle}} in the Presidium was not resolved by the elimination of Beria.

He also sought public support by lowering retail prices <b>and</b> <b>lowering</b> the level of bond sales to citizens, which had long been effectively obligatory. Khrushchev, on the other hand, with his power base in the Party, sought to both strengthen the Party and his position within it. While, under the Soviet system, the Party was to be preeminent, it had been greatly drained of power by Stalin, who had given much of that power to himself and to the Politburo (later, to the Presidium). Khrushchev saw that with the Presidium in conflict, the Party and its Central Committee might again become powerful. Khrushchev carefully cultivated high Party officials, and was able to appoint supporters as local Party bosses, who then took seats on the Central Committee.|$|E

5|$|Following peak intensity, the {{combination}} of increasing wind shear <b>and</b> <b>lowering</b> sea surface temperatures began to slowly weaken Iselle, bringing it below Category4intensity early on August5. Continued wind shear caused the storm to further degrade and its eye to become ragged in appearance. The NHC downgraded Iselle below major hurricane intensity at 18:00UTC that day. At 00:00UTC on August6, forecasting responsibility transferred from the NHC to the Central Pacific Hurricane Center(CPHC). Although wind shear began to decrease thereafter, abundant dry air caused Iselle to rapidly weaken, dropping to Category1 intensity on August6. However, the suppressed wind shear allowed for the hurricane to reorganize and maintain a large eye as it tracked towards Hawaii, and Iselle reached its secondary peak intensity with winds of 100mph (155km/h) at 00:00UTC on August7, making it a minimal Category2 hurricane. Only slow degradation of Iselle's structure followed, though on August7, the storm's eye had faded and the CPHC estimated that Iselle had weakened to a minimal hurricane. Becoming increasingly disorganized, Iselle weakened to a tropical storm the next day before making landfall at 12:30UTC along the Kau coast of Hawaii island with winds of 60mph (95km/h). The mountainous terrain of the island largely disrupted the main cyclonic circulation of Iselle, which manifested {{as a collection of}} small vortices south of the Hawaiian islands. Due to the loss of any sustained thunderstorm activity at the storm's center, the CPHC decided to downgrade Iselle to a remnant area of low pressure on August9; at the time, the disturbance was centered roughly 200mi (320km) west-southwest of Honolulu.|$|E
