5|$|Infamous was {{developed}} by Sucker Punch Productions, {{with a team of}} 60 people working for about three years. Though they could have opted to request the necessary funds from Sony to increase the team size <b>and</b> <b>finish</b> <b>the</b> game in two years, producer Brian Fleming noted that Sucker Punch's iteration-based development approach worked better with a smaller team size.|$|E
5|$|The {{net result}} was that little work was done on the Waterloo Medal. In 1832, the Master of the Mint, Lord Auckland, noted that the dies had been long delayed. In 1836, the new Master, Henry Labouchere, also complained about the delay, feeling the medal could be {{finished}} in 18 months. He offered Pistrucci extra payment if he would take on four apprentices <b>and</b> <b>finish</b> <b>the</b> Waterloo Medal. Pistrucci declined.|$|E
5|$|Borgarello won {{his second}} stage with his {{victory in the}} seventh stage, out-sprinting Micheletto and Carlo Durando. In the final sprint, Micheletto felt that Durando encroached him and moved ahead; this action caused the Italian fans to rush on to the track in anger. The police then moved the two riders to a bar, until the crowd dispersed. Micheletto won his second stage of the race two days later. Before {{the start of the}} final stage, Micheletto became sick and Pavesi {{convinced}} him to continue the race <b>and</b> <b>finish</b> <b>the</b> final stage. Borgarello won his third stage of the race, while Atala-Dunlop consolidated their lead and the race win by having two riders, Micheletto and Galetti, finish in the top four.|$|E

5|$|Eberardo Pavesi {{dominated}} the difficult ninth stage that contained the major climbs of the Nava, Tenda, and San Bartolomeo. Pavesi {{went on to}} win the stage by close to six minutes over the second-place finisher Luigi Ganna. The race's tenth and final stage was marred by rain. Race leader Carlo Galetti crashed into a hay wagon early on in the stage and sustained some heavy wounds, he would get back on his bike <b>and</b> <b>finish</b> <b>the</b> stage in fifth place. Despite the rain in Milan, many spectators still came to watch the riders arrive. Luigi Ganna was the first rider to cross the finish line in Milan and in doing so, he won his third stage of the 1910 Giro d'Italia. Carlo Galetti won the Giro d'Italia by a margin of eighteen points over Pavesi. Galetti and his team, Atala-Continental, won the team classification.|$|E
5|$|If {{the mayor}} dies in office, resigns, or {{is unable to}} carry out his/her duties and he/she did not {{designate}} an acting mayor, {{the president of the}} Board of Supervisors becomes acting mayor until the full Board select a person to fill the vacancy <b>and</b> <b>finish</b> <b>the</b> previous mayoral term. (In the case that both the president of the Board of Supervisors and the mayor are incapacitated, the order of succession is followed.) This has happened six times: James Otis died in office and was succeeded by George Hewston, Eugene Schmitz was removed and succeeded by Charles Boxton, Charles Boxton resigned and was succeeded by Edward Robeson Taylor, James Rolph resigned and was succeeded by Angelo Rossi, George Moscone was assassinated and was succeeded by Dianne Feinstein, and Gavin Newsom resigned and was succeeded by Ed Lee.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis led the British forces southward in the {{aftermath}} of the December26 battle. Leaving 1,400 men under Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mawhood in Princeton, Cornwallis advanced on Trenton with about 5,000 men on January2. His advance was significantly slowed by defensive skirmishing by American riflemen under the command of Edward Hand, and the advance guard did not reach Trenton until twilight. After assaulting the American positions three times, and being repulsed each time, Cornwallis decided to wait <b>and</b> <b>finish</b> <b>the</b> battle the next day. Washington moved his army around Cornwallis's camp that night and attacked Mawhood at Princeton the next day. That defeat prompted the British to withdraw from most of New Jersey for the winter.|$|E

5|$|Players cast {{a fishing}} line {{into the ocean}} and use motion {{controls}} to avoid fish as the hook sinks and to catch as many fish as possible as the reel retracts. Players then touch the screen to shoot fish {{out of the sky}} for money that can be spent on upgrades. Nijman developed the idea during a television show about tuna fishermen. The game was first released as Flash game Radical Fishing with the same basic mechanics. A year after Vlambeer began their iOS development, Gamenauts released Ninja Fishing, a clone of the game that hurt Vlambeer morale. The team worked on other games and spoke publicly about the situation to a standing ovation at the 2012 Game Developers Conference before resolving to scrap the majority of their work <b>and</b> <b>finish</b> <b>the</b> game. Artist Greg Wohlwend moved in with iOS developer Zach Gage to work 14-hour days on the game.|$|E
5|$|Rather than a single, {{overarching}} plot, {{the story}} of Legend of Mana is composed of a multitude of quests split into three main quest arcs, numerous other quests, and a final quest arc. Each main quest arc contains optional side-quests {{in addition to the}} main quests. Whenever the player completes the required portions of one of the quest arcs they are allowed to begin the final arc <b>and</b> <b>finish</b> <b>the</b> game, even if the other arcs have not yet been started or completed. The three main quest arcs prior to the final arc are: the Jumi arc, the Larc and Sierra arc, and the Matilda and Irwin arc.|$|E
5|$|Sastre's {{team had}} been the one setting the pace in the peloton just before the climb, but fell off when Philip Deignan spun out and tumbled off the road into a ditch. Deignan's bike was damaged and he {{sustained}} numerous visible scrapes and bruises, but he managed to continue <b>and</b> <b>finish</b> <b>the</b> stage with the last gruppetto. Sastre himself seemed to be off the form he had had before the rest day, and by virtue of Pellizotti's stage win and two-minute gap over the reigning Tour de France champion, he fell from third to fifth in the overall classification with Pellizotti moving up to third.|$|E

5|$|The River Severn is {{considered}} a navigable river and Gloucester {{used to be an}} important port, with shipping having to deal with the bore. Vessels can ride the tide up from Sharpness to Gloucester. The tide will outstrip the vessel but by timing the journey correctly, a barge can reach Gloucester at high water. Descending is more difficult, and barges often needed to start their descent with one tide, lay up before crossing Longney Sands, <b>and</b> <b>finish</b> <b>the</b> descent at the next tide. These inconveniences in accessing Gloucester were overcome when the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal was opened in 1827, bypassing the need for shipping to use the river to reach Gloucester.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} first start of the 2011–12 season in Stevenage's first home win of the campaign, playing the first 76 minutes in a 4–2 victory over Rochdale on 3 September 2011 Byrom scored his first goal {{of the season in}} the club's {{emphatic}} 6–1 away victory against Colchester United in December 2011, scoring the sixth goal after a fine individual run <b>and</b> <b>finish.</b> <b>The</b> following month, on 14 January 2012, Byrom doubled his goal tally for the season when he scored with a first-time finish from Luke Freeman's cross in Stevenage's 5–1 win over Rochdale at Spotland. Byrom scored in Stevenage's televised FA Cup tie away at Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur in that year, scoring from the penalty spot to give Stevenage a brief lead before Tottenham came back to secure a 3–1 win. He went on to score two further goals during the latter stages of the season; once in a 2–2 draw away at Sheffield United, and the other in a 3–0 win over Bury, {{on the last day of}} the regular season as Stevenage secured a play-off place following their sixth-place finish. He played in both play-off semi-final legs, which Stevenage lost 1–0 on aggregate to Sheffield United. He made 40 appearances during the season, scoring five times. Despite appearing regularly under new manager Gary Smith, Byrom rejected the offer of a contract extension, and left Stevenage in May 2012. During his successful three-year spell with the club, he made 100 appearances in all competitions, scoring eleven goals.|$|E
5|$|They fly to Spain {{separately}} and meet in Barcelona. They decide their schedule, where {{they plan to}} visit Costa Brava, Seville, and Pamplona. On the way to Costa Brava, Imran and Kabir find it annoying that Arjun works even during the trip. Imran nonchalantly throws Arjun's mobile phone out of their car while {{he is in the}} middle of an official call. This leads to a heated argument. Arjun, in a fit of rage, accuses Imran of having an affair, four years prior, with Arjun's previous girlfriend Sonali (a topic which was very sensitive both to Arjun and Imraan). After being pacified by Kabir, they eventually resume their journey. Upon reaching their destination, they meet an Anglo Indian named Laila (Katrina Kaif) on a beach. Imran flirts with her and makes Arjun jealous. Kabir reveals that he has chosen deep sea diving as their first sport, and they later find that Laila is their diving instructor. Arjun, who cannot swim and is aquaphobic, receives assistance from Laila. She helps him overcome his fears <b>and</b> <b>finish</b> <b>the</b> sport successfully. Upon a request by Laila, they attend the La Tomatina festival with her in Buñol and meet Nuria (Ariadna Cabrol), who falls in love with Imraan. Meanwhile, Natasha becomes suspicious of Kabir's involvement with Laila when she sees them via webcam and crashes his bachelor party trip, much to Kabir's discomfort in front of his friends. Imran spends time with Nuria, and Arjun with Laila. After the boys leave, Laila realises she has fallen in love with Arjun and chases them on a bike, not wanting to regret their partition if they do not meet in future. She and Arjun express their feelings for each other with a passionate kiss.|$|E
