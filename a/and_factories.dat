5|$|Following the Napoleonic wars, Denmark lost Norway and was {{excluded}} from international trade {{for some years}} which caused a recession for Aarhus' trade-based economy that lasted until the 1830s.

5|$|Belgium was {{the first}} country in {{continental}} Europe to experience the Industrial Revolution, and was the most intensively industrialized {{country in the world}} throughout most of the period.

5|$|Both the St. Louis German and Irish {{communities}} urged neutrality at the 1914 {{outbreak of}} World War I, which {{contributed to a}} resurgent nativism after U.S. entry into the war in 1917. As a result, German St. Louisans suffered some discrimination during the war, and St. Louisans repressed elements of German culture. Commerce was not dramatically affected by the war. However, leading up to and before World War I, the population started to decrease as men were needed {{to work at the}} artillery plants <b>and</b> <b>factories</b> that were closer to the Atlantic.|$|E

The population in the Bay Area grew faster than even Houston as processing plants <b>and</b> <b>factories</b> were built and expanded. Ellington Air Force Base was built to the southeast of Houston (adjacent to modern Clear Lake City) and became a major air field and flight training center during the wars.|$|E

5|$|On 1 July 1945, the United States Third Fleet sortied from Leyte Gulf in the Philippines {{under the}} command of Admiral William Halsey to attack the Japanese home islands. Halsey's plans {{included}} the use of battleships and cruisers to bombard military facilities <b>and</b> <b>factories.</b> To prepare for these attacks, US Navy submarines sailed into Japan's inshore waters to search for naval mines. USAAF B-29 Superfortress and B-24 Liberator aircraft also conducted photo reconnaissance flights over much of Japan in search of airfields and facilities which could be attacked by the Third Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the past}} century, batik making in Sri Lanka has become firmly established. The Sri Lankan batik {{industry}} is a small scale industry which can employ individual design talent and mainly deals with foreign customers for profit. It is now the most visible of the island's crafts with galleries <b>and</b> <b>factories,</b> large and small, having sprung up in many tourist areas. Rows of small stalls selling batiks can be found all along Hikkaduwa's Galle Road strip. Mahawewa, on the other hand, {{is famous for its}} batik factories.|$|E

5|$|The {{winter of}} 1946–1947 was a harsh European winter {{noted for its}} effects in the United Kingdom. It caused severe hardships in {{economic}} terms and living conditions. There were massive disruptions of energy supply for homes, offices <b>and</b> <b>factories.</b> Animal herds froze or starved to death. People suffered from the persistent cold, and many businesses shut down temporarily. When warm weather returned, the ice thawed and flooding was severe in most low-lying areas.|$|E
5|$|At {{one meeting}} in October 1853, he shared the {{platform}} with John B. Horsfall and Chartist leader Ernest Jones, whose Labour Parliament Grimshaw {{was involved in}} the following year as one of the two delegates from Preston, along with Wallace Beever. The Labour Parliament was partly a response to a lock-out of around 20,000 mill workers by the employers in Preston; its aim was to organise a levy on wages to support operatives who went on strike or were locked out. Those paying the levy were to elect a committee to buy and look after land <b>and</b> <b>factories</b> and the Parliament would meet on a yearly basis. However, the plan did not gain support among all Chartists and the plans never materialised.|$|E
5|$|Boston's harbor {{activity}} was significantly curtailed by the Embargo Act of 1807 (adopted during the Napoleonic Wars) and the War of 1812. Foreign trade returned after these hostilities, but Boston's merchants had found alternatives for their capital {{investments in the}} interim. Manufacturing became {{an important component of}} the city's economy, and the city's industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance by the mid-19th century. Boston remained one of the nation's largest manufacturing centers until the early 20th century, and was notable for its garment production and leather-goods industries. A network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region facilitated shipment of goods and led to a proliferation of mills <b>and</b> <b>factories.</b> Later, a dense network of railroads furthered the region's industry and commerce.|$|E

5|$|By 1911, {{warehouses}} <b>and</b> <b>factories</b> cramped the Prairie Avenue District. Large industry overtook {{the district}} by 1950. Early 21st century deindustrialisation, urban congestion, and historic preservation {{have brought the}} return of trendy buildings, and restored as well as renovated structures. Simultaneously new infill housing is resuscitating the district. Now, the historic northern section of the street {{is part of the}} Chicago Landmark Prairie Avenue District that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was declared a Chicago Landmark on December 27, 1979, and added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 15, 1972. The historic district includes the 1800 and 1900-blocks of South Prairie, the 1800 block of South Indiana and 211 through 217 East Cullerton.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} {{colliery}} site had become crowded, and included a brickworks that used fireclay and shale spoil from the pit. It was surrounded by housing <b>and</b> <b>factories</b> in what {{was one of the most}} industrial parts of Manchester. The ready supply of coal encouraged the development of Manchester's chemical industry around the colliery and in the northeast of the city generally. A factory producing carbolic acid from coal tar was established in 1857, and sulphuric acid and naphthalene were produced from 1865 in nearby Blackley, later the site of ICI's Dyestuff's Division.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, Massachusetts {{became a}} {{national}} leader in the American Industrial Revolution, with factories around cities such as Lowell and Boston producing textiles and shoes, <b>and</b> <b>factories</b> around Springfield producing tools, paper, and textiles. The economy transformed from one based primarily on agriculture to an industrial one, initially making use of water-power and later the steam engine to power factories. Canals and railroads were used for transporting raw materials and finished goods. At first, the new industries drew labor from Yankees on nearby subsistence farms, and later relied upon immigrant labor from Europe and Canada.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Arlington's largest {{employers}} remained its shingle mills and saw mills. Other industries, including dairy processing, mechanical shops, stores, <b>and</b> <b>factories,</b> became prominent after World War I, {{during a period}} of growth for the city. The Great Depression of the 1930s forced {{all but one of the}} mills to close, causing unemployment to rise in Arlington and neighboring cities. The federal government established a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp near Darrington to create temporary jobs; the young men built structures and conducted firefighting in the Mount Baker National Forest. The Works Progress Administration and Civil Works Administration funded the construction of the city's sidewalks, a high school, and a municipal airport that opened in 1934.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{is a very}} {{convenient}} way {{to transfer}} energy, {{and it has been}} adapted to a huge, and growing, number of uses. The invention of a practical incandescent light bulb in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power. Although electrification brought with it its own dangers, replacing the naked flames of gas lighting greatly reduced fire hazards within homes <b>and</b> <b>factories.</b> Public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting. In the late 20th century and in modern times, the trend has started to flow in the direction of deregulation in the electrical power sector.|$|E

The Allies landed in Sicily in July 1943 and in Italy in September. Meanwhile, American and British bomber fleets based in Britain began operations against Germany {{and in an}} effort to destroy German morale many sorties were intentionally given civilian targets. Soon German aircraft production could not keep pace with losses and without air cover the Allied bombing campaign became even more devastating. By targeting oil refineries <b>and</b> <b>factories,</b> they crippled the German war effort by late 1944.|$|E
