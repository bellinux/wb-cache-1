5|$|The Paramhamsa monks, who are loners, are to {{be found}} in deserted houses, in temples, straw huts, on ant hills, sitting under a tree, on sand beds near rivers, in {{mountain}} caves, near waterfalls, in hollows inside trees, or in wide open fields. The Upanishad states that these loners have advanced far in their path of reaching Brahman – they <b>are</b> <b>pure</b> in mind, they are the Paramahamsas.|$|E

In Lebanon iron oxide has a red color instead of the brown beige color which is common in {{northern}} countries. The reason is a different chemical reaction caused by the high temperature which produces {{a different kind of}} iron oxide.|$|E

Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E
5|$|Selenium {{is found}} in metal sulfide ores, where it {{partially}} replaces the sulfur. Commercially, selenium is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores, most often during production. Minerals that <b>are</b> <b>pure</b> selenide or selenate compounds are known but rare. The chief commercial uses for selenium today are glassmaking and pigments. Selenium is a semiconductor and is used in photocells. Applications in electronics, once important, have been mostly supplanted by silicon semiconductor devices. Selenium is still used in a few types of DC power surge protectors and one type of fluorescent quantum dot.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds {{crystallize}} in {{the diamond}} cubic crystal system (space group Fdm) and consist of tetrahedrally, covalently bonded carbon atoms. A second form called lonsdaleite, with hexagonal symmetry, {{has also been}} found, but it is extremely rare and forms only in meteorites or in laboratory synthesis. The local environment of each atom is identical in the two structures. From theoretical considerations, lonsdaleite {{is expected to be}} harder than diamond, but the size and quality of the available stones are insufficient to test this hypothesis. In terms of crystal habit, diamonds occur most often as euhedral (well-formed) or rounded octahedra and twinned, flattened octahedra with a triangular outline. Other forms include dodecahedra and (rarely) cubes. There is evidence that nitrogen impurities {{play an important role in}} the formation of well-shaped euhedral crystals. The largest diamonds found, such as the Cullinan Diamond, were shapeless. These diamonds <b>are</b> <b>pure</b> (i.e. type II) and therefore contain little if any nitrogen.|$|E

5|$|The {{colour pattern}} varies, ranging from very light-coloured {{specimens}} with small, incomplete, dark dorsal crossbars to entirely brown ones with faint or clear, darker brown markings, {{and on to}} melanistic individuals that are entirely dark and lack any apparent dorsal pattern. However, most {{have some kind of}} zigzag dorsal pattern down the entire length of their bodies and tails. The head usually has a distinctive dark V or X on the back. A dark streak runs from the eye to the neck and continues as a longitudinal series of spots along the flanks. Unusual for snakes, the sexes are possible to tell apart by the colour. Females are usually brownish in hue with dark-brown markings, the males <b>are</b> <b>pure</b> grey with black markings. The basal colour of males will often be slightly lighter than that of the females, making the black zigzag pattern stand out. The melanistic individuals are often females.|$|E
5|$|The {{information}} available in Romania for the King Carol I Bridge in Cernavodă, {{as well as}} the results of scientists in France, say that the myths <b>are</b> <b>pure</b> fiction. First of all the Romanian government never finalised the construction contract with the company of Gustave Eiffel or with another foreign company, making the decision to build the bridge only with local companies. The Cernavodă Bridge was made entirely by Romanians, fulfilling the design of Anghel Saligny, which was also the supervisor of the site. In these conditions, not knowing if the contract will be approved, it is unlikely that a foreign company would build the whole superstructure of the bridge. On the other hand, in Austria–Hungary {{there was no need to}} construct a low bridge like the Faidherbe because of the trade routes on the Danube River.|$|E
5|$|An apex predator, Smilodon {{primarily}} hunted large mammals. Isotopes {{preserved in}} the bones of S.fatalis in the La Brea Tar Pits reveal that ruminants like bison (Bison antiquus, which was {{much larger than the}} modern American bison) and camels (Camelops) were most commonly taken by the cats there. In addition, isotopes {{preserved in the}} tooth enamel of S.gracilis specimens from Florida show that this species fed on the peccary Platygonus and the llama-like Hemiauchenia. In rare cases, Smilodon may have also targeted glyptodonts, based on a Glyptotherium skull that bears elliptical puncture marks consistent with the size and diameter of its canine teeth. This was a juvenile glyptodont with an incompletely developed cephalic shield (head armor). Isotopic studies of dire wolf (Canis dirus) and American lion (Panthera leo atrox) bones show an overlap with S.fatalis in prey, which suggests that they were competitors. The availability of prey in the Rancho La Brea area was likely comparable to modern East Africa. As Smilodon migrated to South America, its diet changed; bison were absent, the horses and proboscideans were different, and native ungulates such as toxodonts and litopterns were completely unfamiliar, yet S.populator thrived as well there as its relatives in North America. The differences between the North and South American species {{may be due to the}} difference in prey between the two continents. Smilodon probably avoided eating bone and would have left enough food for scavengers. Smilodon itself may have scavenged dire wolf kills. It has been suggested that Smilodon was a scavenger that mainly used its canines for display to assert dominance over carcasses, but this theory is not supported today as no modern terrestrial mammals <b>are</b> <b>pure</b> scavengers.|$|E
