50|$|On May 11, 2011 the Chairman of the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB), TomAllen, {{announced}} that the FASAB issued Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) 40, Definitional Changes Related to Deferred Maintenance and Repairs: <b>Amending</b> <b>Statement</b> of Federal Financial Accounting Standards 6, Accounting for Property, Plant, and Equipment.SFFAS 40 represents {{a first step toward}} improved reporting on deferred maintenance and repairs. The Board is working, and will continue to work, closely with stakeholders interested in improved reporting on deferred maintenance and repairs. By addressing definitional issues as a first step, the Board will facilitate continued cooperation. Two areas in need of improvement relate to (1) the lack of comparability when assessing asset condition both within and among agencies and (2) measurement and reporting practices that vary greatly among agencies. These issues arise—in part—due to agencies having differing interpretations regarding the definition of “deferredmaintenance” in SFFAS 6. “Redefining the term ’maintenance’ to include repair activities and better reflect asset management practices is an initial step in resolving the problems noted,” according to Chairman Allen. “However, the Board also plans to address measurement and reportingissues through continued consultation with stakeholders which could lead to theissuance of additional guidance and/or standards.|$|E

5000|$|In the U.K. the new 1898 Birmingham <b>Amended</b> <b>Statement</b> of Faith (BASF) {{replaced}} BSF 1884 as a 'touchstone' but did {{not cause}} a significant division in Britain outside London, and even today many British ecclesias continue to have either local statements predating 1884, 1877, or modern statements.

5000|$|Prior to the {{developing}} dispute in Britain over special constables, in America another dispute had been simmering concerning the atonement.

Walker and Birmingham were unwilling to take sides and with two ecclesias at Buffalo, both claiming to follow the Birmingham <b>Amended</b> <b>Statement</b> of Faith, Walker stated [...] "We are not aware that the ecclesias named are at variance with us" [...] although the two ecclesias did not fellowship each other.|$|R

5000|$|Roberts {{was also}} {{involved}} in debates within the Christadelphian movement, which in some cases resulted in divisions. For example, 1865 marked separation from George Dowie of Edinburgh who was teaching {{the doctrine of the}} existence of a supernatural devil. Roberts' brother-in-law, William Norrie, initially sided with Dowie, but Dowie's group did not long survive his death. As an [...] "Arranging Brother" [...] of Birmingham Temperance Hall Ecclesia he was directly involved in the compilation of the Birmingham Statement of Faith (1877), and by letter from overseas agreed with minor amendation to the BASF (Birmingham <b>Amended</b> <b>Statement</b> of Faith) in 1898.

50|$|They tend {{to operate}} organisationally fairly similarly, {{although}} there are different emphases. Despite their differences, the Central, Old Paths, Dawn and Berean fellowships generally subscribe to the Birmingham <b>Amended</b> <b>Statement</b> of Faith (BASF), though the latter two have additional clauses or supporting documents to explain their position. Most Unamended ecclesias use the Birmingham Unamended Statement of Faith (BUSF) with one clause being different. Within the Central fellowship individual ecclesias also may have their own statement of faith, whilst still accepting the statement of faith of the larger community. Some ecclesias have statements around their positions, especially on divorce and re-marriage, making clear that offence would be caused by anyone in that position seeking to join them at the 'Breaking of Bread' service. Others tolerate a degree of divergence from commonly held Christadelphian views.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this Statement No. 57 is a address {{issues related to the}} use of the alternative measurement method and the frequency and timing of measurements by employers that participate in agent multiple-employer other postemployment benefit (OPEB) plans (that is agent employers). This <b>Statement</b> <b>amends</b> <b>Statement</b> No. 45, Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pension, to permit an agent employer that has an individual-employer OPEB plan with fewer than 100 total plan members to use the alternative measurement method, at its option, regardless of the number of total plan members in the agent multiple-employer OPEB plan in which it participates. Consistent with this change to the employer-reporting requirements, this <b>Statement</b> also <b>amends</b> a <b>Statement</b> No. 43, Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefit Plans Other Than Pension Plans, requirement that a defined benefit OPEB plan obtain an actuarial valuations. The amendment permits the requirement to be satisfied for an agent multiple-employer OPEB plan by reporting an aggregation of results of actuarial valuations of the individual- employer OPEB plan or measurements resulting from use of the alternative measurement method for individual-employer OPEB plans that are eligible. In addition, this Statement clarifies that when actuarially determined OPEB measures are reported by an agent multiple-employer OPEB plan and its participating employers, those measures should be determined as of a common date and at a minimum frequency to satisfy the agent multiple-employer OPEB plan’s financial reporting requirements...|$|R
