500|$|According to Howard Linecar in {{his book}} on British coin designs and designers, [...] "Pistrucci held the cutting of these dies [...] as a {{bargaining}} counter in his relentless efforts to obtain the post of Chief Engraver at the Royal Mint". Pistrucci asked each new Master of the Mint for appointment to the position, until in 1828, amid Treasury concerns <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> was being paid Pistrucci, he was made Chief Medallist, a new position, at a reduced salary; William Wyon became Chief Engraver.

In the very few {{interviews}} I've made, it doesn't matter how long we've talked to each other, the headline is still just about my paycheck." [...] After extensive media coverage of his earnings, PewDiePie posted a video, expressing his frustration at the extensive media coverage over his income. In the video he claimed, [...] "We did raise a million dollars for charity, and very few articles picked up on that, but here it is everywhere how much money I make", adding, [...] "It seems like the whole world cares more <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> I make than I do myself."

One such review came from Fraser McAlpine of BBC, who opened, [...] "It's {{one of the fundamental}} laws of pop, anything which tips a nod to 'You Spin Me Round (Like A Record)' by Dead Or Alive is going to be worth a listen." [...] He continued, [...] "Even though this is just a song written {{from the perspective of a}} randy man watching a pole-dancer and bragging <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> he has [...] in a manner which would make Akon blush, there's just something kind of cute about the whole thing." [...] McAlpine attributed this to the song's [...] "Tigger-beat", explaining, [...] "How can anything too sordid be going on when everyone is bouncing around like they're on spacehoppers?" [...] Bill Lamb of About.com commented, [...] "You will hear echoes of another pop classic, but the new song stands on its own feet." [...] However, he noted that while pop music fans would appreciate it, hip hop listeners would likely dismiss it, and he added that [...] "t's not groundbreaking by any means".|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the school}} {{district}} continues to struggle with low high school graduation rates and low standardized test scores, {{the former mayor of}} Newark, Cory Booker, insists, [...] "Newark, New Jersey can become one of the first American cities to solve the crisis in public education." [...] This vision for better school district is also shared by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who made a $100 million donation to Newark Public Schools in 2010. [...] "Every child deserves a good education. Right now that's not happening," [...] he says. The management has been criticized: while interviews with administration regarding Newark's schools were always positive, highlighting, of course, only the good aspects of the huge monetary donation, new contracts were being created, money was being hemorrhaged, and the district was going broke.

2500|$|Eves' campaigning {{followed}} a straightforward pattern. Eves would highlight {{one of the}} five elements of the platform and then attack Dalton McGuinty for opposing it.

Under budgetary pressures current and future, goals for support and visioning face increased scrutiny and a demand for return on investment.

The 2008 IT budget of a midsize state university on the East Coast, shown in Figure 1, demonstrates the amount of money at stake, even though the 2. 1 million budget is modest compared to the budgets of larger institutions. Decisions <b>about</b> where and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> to spend cannot be left to traditional models or 2 ̆ 2 gut feelings. 2 ̆ 2 A solid understanding of needs, however conceptualized, is the critical first step in providing an IT office with data crucial for sustainable innovation, as well as helping it solve and forecast problems...|$|R
40|$|At {{regional}} honors conferences, {{which typically}} occur {{around the same}} time as the NCAA and NIT basketball tournaments, many of us have facetiously wondered aloud whether basketball teams and their coaches spend as much time talking about honors as we spend talking about basketball. Back on our home campuses, a more serious connection between honors and athletics programs often takes the form of mutual recruitment efforts, schedule coordination, arrangement of make-up tests, co-advising, and enthusiastic attendance at sports events when honors students are in the competition. Many honors programs and colleges also sponsor their own sports events, fielding intramural teams or hosting Frisbee tournaments. Academics’ attitudes toward sports programs are often complex; a faculty member might simultaneously play pick-up volleyball with her students, have season tickets to the school’s football games, and grumble loudly <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> attention and <b>money</b> are devoted to the athletic budget. Some of that complexity occurs among honors administrators as well.

40|$|The {{literature}} on EU integration has long {{recognized that the}} European Commission has promoted a pan‐European civil society {{in order to increase}} the legitimacy of the supranational institutions. While we know the Commission fosters EU civil society by encouraging their formal and informal participation in the EU policymaking processes and by directly funding them (Mahoney 2004), we have, until now, known very little <b>about</b> just <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> the Commission has been granting EU civil society organizations and to which segments of European civil society. This paper tests whether the Commission’s stated goals and the assumptions of EU integration scholars are reflected in the reality of its funding practices. We present analyses from two original databases: 1. The Commission’s own registry of 685 civil society organizations which includes information about the groups and the funding they have received from the Commission; and 2. A database of 1, 164 civil society groups that received funding from the Commission from 2003 ‐ 2007. The findings show that the Commission’s funding decisions do indeed reflect its goals of supporting a supranational EU civil society through its support of groups organized at the EU‐level (over groups organized at the national and sub‐national level) and through its support of EU integration groups; European youth, education and intercultural exchange groups; and citizenship, democracy promotion and education groups. The findings also show however, {{that when it comes to}} societal cohesion, the Commission’s funding practices are not in line with its rhetoric. Rather than equal funding across member states, or extra support for the civil society groups of the new member states, it is the oldest and wealthiest members that are receiving the largest numbers of grants and the largest amounts of funding. The analysis, compiled from funding documents recently released through the European Transparency Initiative, is the first systematic study of the types of groups that are receiving funding and the factors that explain those funding patterns...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} tobacco {{industry}} responsibility for population {{health problems and}} compensation for their treatment has been growing since the 1960 s. In 1999, the state attorneys general collectively launched the largest class action lawsuit in US history and sued the tobacco industry to recover the costs of caring for smokers. In {{what became known as}} the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA), states were rewarded billions of dollars and won concessions regarding how cigarettes could be advertised and targeted to minors. Ten years after this settlement, <b>much</b> is known <b>about</b> <b>how</b> MSA monies were distributed and how states have used the money. There is some understanding <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of the <b>money</b> went toward offsetting the health-care costs attributable to smoking and whether resources were allocated to efforts to reduce smoking in a particular state. However, there are few data on what effect, if any, the MSA had on tobacco control locally and nationally. This commentary explores these issues, as well as how the tobacco industry has evolved to offset the losses incurred by the settlement. Finally, an analysis of the complexities of current tobacco policy making is provided so that physicians and other health-care advocacy groups can more completely understand the present-day political dynamics and be more effective in shaping tobacco control policy in the future...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Through four rounds of base closures and realignments between 1988 and 1995, the Department of Defense (DOD) expected to reduce its domestic infrastructure and provide needed dollars for high priority programs, such as weapons modernization. Although DOD projects it will realize significant recurring savings from the closures and realignments, Congress continues to raise questions <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>much,</b> if any, <b>money</b> has been saved through the base closure process. Two GAO reports issued in late 1998 concluded that net savings from the four closure rounds were substantial but that the cost and savings estimates {{used to calculate the}} net savings were imprecise. This report reviews (1) the basis for DOD's recent increase in net savings projected to be realized from the closure process and (2) GAO's previous observations on the basis for savings from base closure and realignment actions and the precision of the cost and savings estimates. DOD's fiscal year 2001 budget request and documentation show that it now expects net savings of about $ 15. 5 billion through fiscal year 2001 and about $ 6. 1 billion in annual recurring savings thereafter, an increase from the $ 14. 2 billion and about $ 5. 6 billion, respectively, DOD reported in fiscal year 1999. GAO's analysis of the data showed that the net savings increase through fiscal year 2001 was due primarily to an overall reduction of about $ 723 million in reported costs and an increase of about $ 610 million in expected savings resulting from the closures. The net savings for the four rounds of base closures and realignments are substantial and are related to decreased funding requirements in specific operational areas. Reviews by the Congressional Budget Office, the DOD Inspector General, and the Army Audit Agency have affirmed that net savings are substantial after initial investment costs are recouped. However, those same reviews also showed that the estimates are imprecise and should be viewed as a rough approximation of the likely savings. ...|$|R
