25|$|Local {{cooking in}} Macau {{consists}} of a blend of Cantonese and Portuguese cuisines. Many unique dishes resulted from the spice blends that the wives of Portuguese sailors used {{in an attempt to}} replicate European dishes. Its ingredients and seasonings include those from Europe, South America, Africa, India, and Southeast Asia, as well as local Chinese ingredients. Typically, Macanese food is seasoned with various spices and flavours including turmeric, coconut milk, cinnamon and bacalhau, giving special aromas and tastes. Famous dishes include minchi, capella, galinha à Portuguesa, galinha à Africana (African chicken), bacalhau, Macanese chili shrimps <b>and</b> <b>stir-fry</b> curry crab. Pork chop bun, ginger milk and Portuguese-style egg tart are also very popular in Macau. Especially from Lord Stow's Bakery in Coloane where the first Macau-style egg tart was invented (a blend of British and Portuguese styles).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT In a {{study of}} {{marketing}} opportunities for fresh, dark chicken meat, focus group participants (n = 34) provided qualitative information concerning potential products and packaging concepts. Results of the focus groups indicated that the participants were willing to purchase new, convenient poultry products made from dark chicken meat. Specific dark meat products the participants were willing to buy included boneless, skinless thighs, kabob cubes, <b>and</b> <b>stir-fry</b> strips. Consumers desired clear packaging for the products but {{did not want the}} packaging to be microwaveable or ovenproof. Acceptance of chicken kabob chunks <b>and</b> <b>stir-fry</b> strips of varying piece sizes (2. 54, 3. 81, and 5. 08 cm) and seasoning concentrations (1. 6, 2. 1, and 2. 6 %) was evaluated by consumers (n = 83) using a nine-point hedonic scale. The most preferred products were a 5. 08 cm (2 in) kabob with 2. 6 % seasoning and a stir-fry strip with 2. 6 % seasoning. A simulated supermarket setting test was conducted to verify findings from a mailed survey (n = 115) and actual purchase behavior by consumers (n = 121). A calculated desirability index indicated a ranked preference to be: breasts> kabobs> stir-fry> boneless, skinless thighs> bone-in, skin-on thighs.

40|$|The {{concentration}} of carcinogens in the airborne dust of 33 homes in Hong Kong was studied {{to identify the}} sources and measure the amounts of 7 polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) including benzo(a) pyrene. The 24 hr samples were collected from kitchens and living rooms of working class homes and analyzed by HPLC. The mean levels of PAH in air and dust were comparatively low, with cooking fires and incense associated with significant increases, and window ventilating fans with significant decreases in PAH concentrations. Perceived pollution sources like water heaters, cigarette smoke, <b>and</b> <b>stir‐fry</b> cooking, led to reduced airborne PAH levels because human responses to these emission sources were to increase natural and mechanical ventilation. The data indicated that compensation behaviours can over‐ride the effects of emission sources, and help explain why measures of increased ventilation from open windows and doors were generally associated with higher PAH levels. The {{results of this study}} show that indoor air quality in homes varies with cultural practices, behavioural responses, and climate...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the postharvest {{behavior}} of detached leaves from pak choy (Brassica rapa var. chinensis), an Asian leafy vegetable commonly used in salad <b>and</b> <b>stir-fry</b> mixes. Color, ethylene production, soluble sugars, starch and proteins were measured during storage of leaves at 2 °C, 10 °C and 20 °C. The main limiting factor on storage life was yellowing at 10 °C and 20 °C and physiological damage {{in the form of}} wilting at 2 °C. At 20 °C, ethylene evolution occurs concurrently with yellowing with a rapid decline in sugar concentration immediately prior to yellowing. As temperature was lowered, both ethylene production and sugar decline slowed or became negligible. The rate of soluble sugar decline (in particular, glucose) appears mainly responsible for the regulation of yellowing in detached pak choy leaves with a minimal role for ethylene. Refrigeration of detached pak choy leaves appears to be an ideal technique for the extension of storage life due to the slowing of the rate of sugar decline, which appears to be a key determinant of leaf yellowing.

40|$|Three cooking methods, namely boiling, steaming, <b>and</b> <b>stir-frying</b> for 5 to 10 min, {{were used}} to {{evaluate}} the effect on nutrient components, free amino acids, L-ascorbic acid, total phenolic contents, and antioxidant capacities of bamboo shoots (Phyllostachys praecox). Results showed that boiling <b>and</b> <b>stir-frying</b> had a great effect on the nutrient components and they decreased the contents of protein, soluble sugar, and ash, and caused a great loss in the total free amino acids (decreased by 38. 35 % and 34. 86 %, respectively). Significant differences (P< 0. 05) in free amino acids were observed in the samples cooked by different methods. Stir-fried bamboo shoots had a high fat content which increased by 528. 57 % because of the addition of edible oil. After boiling, the L-ascorbic acid and total phenolic contents were significantly reduced, while steaming increased total phenolic content by 3. 98 % <b>and</b> <b>stir-frying</b> well-preserved L-ascorbic acid (78. 87 % of its previous content). Results of the antioxidative property study showed that stir-frying could increase antioxidant capacities of bamboo shoots.

25|$|Another {{study from}} Zhejiang University {{examined}} the nutritional value of broccoli after five common cooking techniques; steaming, boiling, microwaving, <b>stir-frying</b> <b>and</b> <b>stir-frying</b> followed by deep frying. The {{study found that}} the two most common methods of home cooking in China, <b>stir-frying</b> <b>and</b> <b>stir-frying</b> combined with deep frying in soybean oil, resulted in a much greater loss of chlorophyll, soluble protein, soluble sugar and vitamin C. The method which affected these values the least was steaming. Stir frying for five minutes and stir frying combined with boiling caused the highest loss of glucosinolates which according to this study are best preserved by steaming. A study performed by the Spanish National Research Counsel stir fried the broccoli for only 3 minutes 30 seconds and found that nutritional value of these broccoli samples varied depending on which cooking oil was used. Comparing these results to an uncooked sample, the study found that phenolics and vitamin C were reduced more than glucosinolates <b>and</b> minerals. <b>Stir-frying</b> with soybean, peanut, safflower or extra virgin olive did not reduce glucosinolates, <b>and</b> broccoli <b>stir-fried</b> with extra virgin olive oil or sunflower oil had vitamin C levels similar to uncooked broccoli. These levels were significantly lower with other edible oils.|$|R
