5|$|In 1881, {{a report}} was {{commissioned}} on water resources {{within a reasonable}} distance of Cardiff. The report concluded that the Taff Fawr scheme would fulfil the town's requirements <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> cost and {{it was decided to}} create Llanishen Reservoir. Construction of the reservoir started in 1882 by the engineer James Simpson for the Cardiff Waterworks Company and was completed in 1886.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, a {{biochemical}} polymorphism {{study was}} conducted in four sample areas of the species. Electrophoretically demonstrable variation was found in one or more populations at 15 of 39 (38%) of the loci examined, and two and sometimes three alleles per locus were detected. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>least,</b> the findings give an indication of the kind of genetic variation that may be found between populations within a species. The amount of variation was similar to findings in examinations of Peromyscus polionotus, Sigmodon, and Dipodomys.|$|E

5|$|The {{geographical}} {{isolation and}} recent glacial history of Shetland {{have resulted in}} a depleted mammalian fauna and the brown rat and house mouse are two of only three species of rodent present on the islands. The Shetland field mouse is the third and the archipelago's fourth endemic subspecies, of which there are three varieties on Yell, Foula and Fair Isle. They are variants of Apodemus sylvaticus and archaeological evidence suggests that this species was present during the Middle Iron Age (around 200 BC to AD 400).

5|$|The {{outcome of}} a {{successful}} military campaign could vary in {{its impact on the}} defeated polity. In some cases, entire cities were sacked, and never resettled, as at Aguateca. In other instances, the victors would seize the defeated rulers, their families, and patron gods. The captured nobles and their families could be imprisoned, or sacrificed. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> severe end of the scale, the defeated polity would be obliged to pay tribute to the victor.|$|E
5|$|The {{applications}} from Tone intrigued the Directory, which understood that by attacking Ireland {{they would be}} striking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> defensible part of the British Isles. Support for the British government was weakest there and the United Irishmen optimistically claimed {{to be able to}} raise an irregular army of as many as 250,000 waiting to join the French once they had landed, with the additional attraction that a successful establishment of an Irish Republic would prove an ideological coup for the French Republic. Finally and most significantly, a large expeditionary force in Ireland could provide an ideal springboard for an invasion of Britain, especially in combination with a plan then under development to land 2,000 uniformed criminals in Cornwall, who would distract the British Army during the invasion of Ireland and could potentially provide a beachhead for future operations.|$|E
