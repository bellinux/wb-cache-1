5|$|Burnet made {{significant}} contributions to influenza research; he developed techniques to grow and study the virus, including hemagglutination assays. He worked on a live vaccine <b>against</b> <b>influenza,</b> but the vaccine was unsuccessful when tested during World War II. His interest in the influenza receptor led him to discover the neuraminidase that is secreted by Vibrio cholerae, which later provided the foundation for Alfred Gottschalk's significant work on glycoproteins and the neuraminidase substrate, sialic acid. Between 1951 and 1956, Burnet worked on the genetics of influenza. He examined the genetic control of virulence and demonstrated that the virus recombined at high frequency; this observation was not fully appreciated until several years later, when the segmented genome of influenza was demonstrated.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of convincing {{evidence}} of toxicity of thiomersal when used as a vaccine preservative, the USPHS and AAP determined that thiomersal should be removed from vaccines as a purely precautionary measure. This action {{was based on the}} precautionary principle, which assumes that there is no harm in exercising caution even if it later turns out to be unnecessary. The CDC and AAP reasoned that despite {{the lack of}} evidence of significant harm in the use of thiomersal in vaccines, the removal of this preservative would increase the public confidence in the safety of vaccines. Although thiomersal was largely removed from routine infant vaccines by summer 2001 in the U.S., some vaccines continue to contain non-trace amounts of thiomersal, mainly in multi-dose vaccines targeted <b>against</b> <b>influenza</b> and tetanus.|$|E

It is usually well tolerated. A vaccine made for one year may not be useful in the following year, since the virus evolves rapidly. Antiviral drugs such as the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir, among others, have been used to treat influenza.

25|$|People {{who work}} with poultry and swine, {{especially}} those with intense exposures, {{are at increased risk}} of zoonotic infection with influenza virus endemic in these animals, and constitute a population of human hosts in which zoonosis and reassortment can co-occur. Vaccination of these workers <b>against</b> <b>influenza</b> and surveillance for new influenza strains among this population may therefore be an important public health measure. Transmission of influenza from swine to humans {{who work with}} swine was documented in a small surveillance study performed in 2004 at the University of Iowa. This study, among others, forms the basis of a recommendation that people whose jobs involve handling poultry and swine be the focus of increased public health surveillance. Other professions at particular risk of infection are veterinarians and meat processing workers, although the risk of infection for both of these groups is lower than that of farm workers.|$|E
500|$|Many viruses undergo {{frequent}} mutations {{that result}} in changes in amino acid composition of their important proteins. Epitopes located on the protein may also undergo alterations in the process. Such an altered epitope binds less strongly with the antibodies specific to the [...] unaltered epitope that would have stimulated the immune system. This is unfortunate because somatic hypermutation does give rise to clones capable of producing soluble antibodies that would have bound the altered epitope avidly enough to neutralize it. But these clones would consist of naive cells which {{are not allowed to}} proliferate by the weakly binding antibodies produced by the priorly stimulated clone. This doctrine is known as the original antigenic sin. This phenomenon comes into play particularly in immune responses <b>against</b> <b>influenza,</b> dengue and HIV viruses. This limitation, however, is not imposed by the phenomenon of polyclonal response, but rather, against it by an immune response that is biased in favor of experienced memory cells against the [...] "novice" [...] naive cells.|$|E

LAIV efficacy versus placebo was 95. 4 % [95 % confidence interval: 88. 5, 98. 1] (year 1) and 88. 5 % [77. 4, 94. 9] (year 2) <b>against</b> moderate/severe <b>influenza</b> and 91. 4 % [77. 9, 96. 7] (year 1) and 84. 2 % [56. 7, 94. 3] (year 2) <b>against</b> milder <b>influenza.</b> The relative efficacy of LAIV versus IIV was 52. 2 % [31. 6, 66. 6] for moderate/severe influenza and 45. 0 % [28. 6, 57. 5] for milder <b>influenza.</b> Efficacy <b>against</b> all <b>influenza</b> illnesses, regardless of severity, is critical to prevent influenza illness and transmission in the community...|$|R

40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} issues of {{vaccination}} of workers in social services <b>against</b> seasonal <b>influenza</b> in homes for the elderly. Furthermore, this diploma thesis deals with possible ethical dilemmas in connection with cancellation of mandatory vaccination <b>against</b> seasonal <b>influenza</b> {{as a result of}} the change of legislation in 2010. The thesis is divided into a theoretical and a practical part. The theoretical part summarizes the basic information concerning seasonal influenza, its impact and prevention, and also provides an overview of long stay services focused on homes for the elderly. In the theoretical part there are also described the basic aspects relating to ensuring the quality of the service provided. Results of the quantitative research carried out in six homes for the elderly are presented and evaluated in the practical part of the thesis. The main goal of the diploma thesis is to map trends concerning the immunization coverage of workers in social services <b>against</b> seasonal <b>influenza,</b> opinions of these workers, their attitudes towards and motivation for such vaccination. Survey research shows that the cancellation of mandatory vaccination <b>against</b> seasonal <b>influenza</b> had a negative impact on immunization coverage of the workers in social services and that in the past the most common reason for vaccination was the duty laid down by law. Moreover, it follows from the results of the research that currently the main reason for refusal of vaccination lies in distrust in efficiency of vaccination. The research has also shown the importance of practising physicians' recommendations for vaccination and their irreplaceable part in provision of information about influenza. The secondary aim of the thesis was to discover how the workers in homes for the elderly perceive the impact of sickness rate of workers in social services caused by seasonal influenza on functioning of the organisation and on the quality of the services provided. As the research has shown, the workers do not believe that incapacity for work due to influenza has an impact on the functioning and quality of the services provided. Another secondary aim of this thesis was to obtain an overview of possible motivation of the workers in homes for the elderly for increase in immunization coverage <b>against</b> seasonal <b>influenza.</b> It follows from the results of the research in question that the strongest motivation for the workers would be represented by reintroduction of mandatory vaccination. The third secondary aim of the thesis was to identify possible ethical dilemmas with respect to change in duty of vaccination <b>against</b> seasonal <b>influenza.</b> These dilemmas are defined in the conclusion of the practical part of the thesis. The results may be utilized as resource materials for motivation of both the senior employees and other employees of the homes for the elderly for vaccination <b>against</b> seasonal <b>influenza</b> with respect to protection of their clients...|$|R
