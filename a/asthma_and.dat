This study assessed BMI in a Canadian sample of <b>asthma</b> outpatients, <b>and</b> evaluated associations between BMI <b>and</b> levels of <b>asthma</b> severity, <b>asthma</b> control, <b>and</b> asthma-related quality of life. A total of 382 adult asthma patients underwent demographic and medical history interviews {{on the day of}} their clinic visit. Patients’ self-reported height and weight were used to calculate BMI (kg/m 2). Asthma severity was classified according the GINA (2002) guidelines.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Fraction of exhaled {{nitric oxide}} (Feno) and blood {{eosinophil}} count (B-Eos) values, markers {{of local and}} systemic eosinophilic inflammation, respectively, are increased in asthmatic patients. Little {{is known about the}} relation of these markers to reported wheeze <b>and</b> <b>asthma</b> events in a random population sample. OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the individual and independent values of B-Eos and Feno in relation to wheeze, <b>asthma</b> diagnosis, <b>and</b> <b>asthma</b> events in a cross-sectional study. METHODS: Feno and B-Eos values were measured in 12, 408 subjects aged 6 to 80 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007 - 2008 and 2009 - 2010. Current wheeze <b>and</b> <b>asthma</b> diagnosis, as well as <b>asthma</b> attacks <b>and</b> asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits within the last 12 months, were assessed by means of questionnaires. RESULTS: Intermediate or high Feno values and intermediate or high B-Eos values were independently associated with having <b>asthma,</b> wheeze, <b>and</b> <b>asthma</b> attacks. However, only intermediate and high B-Eos values were independently associated with asthma-related ED visits. High Feno (≥ 50 ppb) and B-Eos (≥ 500 cells/mm(3)) values rendered an adjusted odds ratio of 4. 5 of having wheeze, 5. 1 of having asthma, 5. 4 for <b>asthma</b> attacks, <b>and</b> 2. 9 for asthma-related ED visits compared with normal Feno (< 25 ppb) and B-Eos (< 300 cells/mm(3)) values. CONCLUSIONS: Exhaled nitric oxide and B-Eos values offered independent information in relation to the prevalence of wheeze, <b>asthma</b> diagnosis, <b>and</b> <b>asthma</b> events in this random population sample. The clinical importance of these findings in asthmatic patients with regard to phenotyping and individualized treatment, considering both local and systemic eosinophilic inflammation, needs to be determined...|$|R

METHODS: We selected children <b>and</b> adolescents with <b>asthma</b> (7 - 17 years of age) from the Pediatric Pulmonology Outpatient Clinic of the State University of Campinas Hospital de Clínicas, located in the city of Campinas, Brazil. <b>Asthma</b> control <b>and</b> <b>asthma</b> severity were assessed by the <b>Asthma</b> Control Test <b>and</b> by the questionnaire based on the Global Initiative for Asthma, respectively. The patients also completed the Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ), validated for use in Brazil, in order to evaluate their {{quality of life}}. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 11. 22 ± 2. 91 years, with a median of 11. 20 (7. 00 - 17. 60) years. We selected 100 patients, of whom 27, 33, and 40 were classified as having controlled asthma (CA), partially controlled <b>asthma</b> (PCA), <b>and</b> uncontrolled <b>asthma</b> (UA), respectively. As for asthma severity, 34, 19, and 47 were classified as having mild asthma (MiA), moderate <b>asthma</b> (MoA), <b>and</b> severe <b>asthma</b> (SA), respectively. The CA and the PCA groups, when compared with the NCA group, showed higher values for the overall PAQLQ score and all PAQLQ domains (activity limitation, symptoms, and emotional function; p < 0. 001 for all).

40|$|Genetics of parentally {{reported}} <b>asthma,</b> eczema <b>and</b> rhinitis in 5 -yr-old twins C. E. M. van Beijsterveldt and D. I.

Information on <b>asthma,</b> eczema <b>and</b> rhinitis was obtained by parental report. Parents were asked whether a physician had ever diagnosed the condition. Complete data were available for 8, 633 5 -yr-old twin pairs born between 1986 and 1998. The frequency of parentally reported <b>asthma,</b> eczema <b>and</b> rhinitis was 8. 7, 16. 8 and 4. 4 %, respectively, and was higher in males than females. Genetic factors accounted for, 90 % of the variance in the susceptibility to <b>asthma,</b> eczema <b>and</b> rhinitis. The magnitude of genetic factors did not differ between males and females. The remaining part of the variance was explained by environmental factors not shared by family members. The phenotypic correlations between parentally reported <b>asthma,</b> eczema <b>and</b> rhinitis were moderate and mainly mediated by the same genetic factors. The high heritability and the limited influence of shared environmental factors may point to gene x environment interactions. Future research should focus on this type of interaction processes...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundAchieving good asthma {{control has}} become the major goal of asthma treatment. Studies have {{reported}} {{a high rate of}} psychiatric disorders among asthma patients, though the impact of these disorders on <b>asthma</b> control <b>and</b> quality of life remains unexplored. This study evaluated the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in 406 adult <b>asthma</b> patients, <b>and</b> associations between psychiatric status, levels of <b>asthma</b> control, <b>and</b> asthma-related quality of life. MethodsConsecutive asthma patients presenting to the asthma clinic underwent a brief, structured psychiatric interview, completed the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) <b>and</b> <b>Asthma</b> Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), and reported the frequency of bronchodilator use in the past week. All patients underwent standard pulmonary function testing. ResultsA total of 34 % (n= 136) of patients had one or more psychiatric diagnosis, including major depression (15 %), minor depression (5 %), dysthymia (4 %), panic disorder (12 %), generalized anxiety disorder (5 %), and social phobia (4 %). Though there were no differences in pulmonary function, patients with versus without psychiatric disorders had worse ACQ and AQLQ scores and reported greater bronchodilator use, independent age, sex <b>and</b> <b>asthma</b> severity. ConclusionsResults suggest that psychiatric disorders are prevalent among asthmatics and are associated with worse <b>asthma</b> control <b>and</b> quality of life.
