30|$|The {{formation}} <b>of</b> <b>AgCl</b> {{has been}} investigated by many scientific papers, but in other media and under different conditions. The formation <b>of</b> <b>AgCl</b> on silver electrodes has been specifically studied in chloride media [24 – 26]. Formation of the first layer follows an adsorption-desorption mechanism, then a thin film <b>of</b> <b>AgCl</b> grows due to diffusion. As the AgCl film is discontinuous, ion transport takes place via spaces between grains <b>of</b> <b>AgCl.</b> As the film thickens, the spaces between the AgCl grains close up and the ion transport occurs mainly via micro-channels running through the AgCl grains [24]. In these studies [24 – 26], the thickness <b>of</b> the <b>AgCl</b> layer is <b>of</b> the order of tens of μm, and Ag+ ions are produced by the anodic potential. The formation <b>of</b> <b>AgCl</b> on archaeological silver objects occurs under different conditions. Accelerated corrosion tests were conducted to study the corrosion film observed on archaeological objects [14, 23], but these standard test samples also had a fine layer of corrosion products. Removing the protective oxide film is necessary to support the formation of silver chloride. In our analysis, we did not identify the presence of Ag 2 O. Jaro M. [27] suggested that in burial conditions (e.g. in crypts or graves), ammonia dissolves silver oxides, and silver ions react to form silver chloride, chlorargyrite (AgCl). Organic decomposition products (ammonia, nitrates, acetic acid, H 2 S) favour the initial corrosion process [6]. Silver chloride does not create a protective layer, thus the metal can be completely transformed into silver chloride.|$|R

Three stages of lattice fluctuations were identified and correlated to the structural evolution. During the steady state, a quasi-layered growth mode of Ag in both vertical and lateral directions were observed due to the confinement <b>of</b> <b>AgCl</b> lattices.

30|$|However, as {{to these}} {{three groups of}} Ag/Au/AgCl hollow NWs, the {{different}} photocatalytic performances are decided by the synergetic activities of semiconductors and noble metals. In this Ag/Au/AgCl hollow NWs, the different ratio of Au, Ag, and AgCl could influence the production and separation effective of charges. Specifically, {{the total number of}} noble metal atoms (Au and Ag) is reduced gradually from S 1 to S 3. The LSPR effect of Au and Ag is reduced correspondingly. According to the aforementioned theory, excess amount of noble metal is not beneficial to improve the photocatalytic activity of semiconductor, because excess SPR electrons can consume the holes on VB <b>of</b> <b>AgCl.</b> In addition, when the ratio of Au and Ag is increased gradually, in order to reach the new balance of Fermi level, the Au is more electronegative and Ag is more electropositive. This electropositive surface of Ag is propitious to form a Cl 0 with Cl−. Thus, the large ratio of Au and Ag could improve the photocatalytic performance. On the other hand, the absorption range of Ag NWs is 320 [*]~[*] 600  nm, and the theoretical absorption band <b>of</b> <b>AgCl</b> is 380  nm. The PRET effect of Ag could partially match with the band gap <b>of</b> <b>AgCl,</b> it promotes the AgCl to produce more electron/hole pairs. More metal Ag in these Ag/Au/AgCl hollow NWs is more favorable for photocatalytic reaction. But the influences of former two factors are greater than the third one. Moreover, AgCl as a wide bandgap semiconductor could absorb UV light for effective UV light-driven photocatalytic performance. The content <b>of</b> <b>AgCl</b> in samples S 1, S 2, and S 3 is increased gradually, and the photocatalytic activities are also increased in theory. While the AgCl not only acts as photocatalyst under UV light, it also provides a carrier for charge separation and provides an electron donator for the oxidation of Cl− and the holes in noble metal. Thus, more AgCl in these Ag/Au/AgCl hollow NWs are more favorable. After the comprehensive <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the two systems (Ag/Au bimetals and AgCl semiconductor), it proposes that the photocatalytic performances of S 1, S 2, and S 3 should be improved gradually. But in fact, S 2 shows the best photocatalytic activity, because morphology is another important factor to influence the photocatalytic performances. The increased amount <b>of</b> <b>AgCl</b> in S 3 could encapsulate the Ag/Au bimetals, and it prevents most of light absorption of noble metal. This proclaim can be confirmed by the SEM images (Additional file  1 : Figure S 1 c and S 1 d) and UV-vis spectrum (Fig.  5). Additionally, the increased Au atoms could also prevent the Ag contact with Cl−. And the photocatalytic activity <b>of</b> <b>AgCl</b> under UV light cannot be neglected.

40|$|Electrically {{conductive}} {{films are}} key components in most printed and flexible electronics applications. For the solution processing of conductive films, inks containing silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) remain important {{because of their}} relatively easy processing and generally low resistivity after a sintering procedure. Because the commonly used, moderate sintering temperatures of 150 - 300 °C are still too high for most low-cost flexible substrates, expanding the knowledge of surface-ink interactions that affect the sintering temperature is desirable. It is known that chloride ions can assist the sintering of AgNP films by displacing capping agents on the surfaces of AgNPs. However, very {{little is known about}} other possible Cl-AgNP interactions that affect the resistivity and no interaction having the opposite effect (sintering inhibition) has been identified before.
