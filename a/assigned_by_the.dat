5|$|The Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW—Supreme Command of the Armed Forces) kept {{separate}} Knight's Cross lists, one {{for each}} of the three military branches, Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy), Luftwaffe (Air force) and for the Waffen-SS. Within each of these lists a unique sequential number was assigned to each recipient. The same numbering paradigm was applied to the higher grades of the Knight's Cross, one list per grade. The sequential numbers greater than 143 for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords are unofficial and were <b>assigned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (AKCR) and are therefore denoted in parentheses. The recipients are ordered chronologically and numbered by the official sequential number <b>assigned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> OKW. The rank listed is the recipient's rank at the time the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves was awarded.|$|E

5000|$|The {{algorithm}} is often presented as assigning objects to <b>the</b> nearest cluster <b>by</b> distance. <b>The</b> standard algorithm aims at minimizing the WCSS objective, and thus <b>assigns</b> <b>by</b> [...] "least sum of squares", {{which is exactly}} equivalent to <b>assigning</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> smallest Euclidean distance. Using a different distance function other than (squared) Euclidean distance may stop the algorithm from converging. Various modifications of k-means such as spherical k-means and k-medoids have been proposed to allow using other distance measures.|$|R

While Harry is being sorted, the Hat {{suggests}} that he be placed into Slytherin which is known to house potential dark witches and wizards, but when Harry objects, the Hat sends him to Gryffindor. Ron and Hermione are also sorted into Gryffindor. Draco is sorted into Slytherin, like his whole family before him.|$|E
5|$|Captain Joseph Miceli, <b>assigned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Navy to {{lead the}} {{technical}} investigation into the explosion, had supervised the preparation of powder and shells used in Iowa's 16-inch guns. Thus, according to Thompson, Miceli had {{a conflict of interest}} in ensuring that the powder, ammunition, or guns were not at fault in the explosion. After being briefed on the NIS's focus on Hartwig, Miceli directed his investigative team to determine how Hartwig had initiated the explosion using an electrical or chemical detonator.|$|E

5|$|The Assaf dynasty (also called Banu Assaf) were a Sunni Muslim {{and ethnic}} Turkmen dynasty of chieftains {{based in the}} Keserwan region of Mount Lebanon.

5|$|Emergency {{ambulances}} {{are highly}} {{likely to be}} involved in hazardous situations, including incidents such as a road traffic collision, as these emergencies create people who are likely to be in need of treatment. They are required to gain access to patients as quickly as possible, and in many countries, are given dispensation from obeying certain traffic laws. For instance, {{they may be able to}} treat a red traffic light or stop sign as a yield sign ('give way'), or be permitted to break the speed limit. Generally, the priority of the response to the call will be <b>assigned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> dispatcher, but the priority of the return will be decided by the ambulance crew based on the severity of the patient's illness or injury. Patients in significant danger to life and limb (as determined by triage) require urgent treatment by advanced medical personnel, and because of this need, emergency ambulances are often fitted with passive and active visual and/or audible warnings to alert road users.|$|E

5|$|From 1911 to 1921, the north–south {{section of}} modern NY251 near Scottsville {{was part of}} Route15, an {{unsigned}} legislative route <b>assigned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> New York State Legislature. The first portion {{of what is now}} NY251 to receive a posted designation was the segment east of NY64 in Mendon, which was part of the signed NY15 from 1924 to 1930. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY251 was assigned to an alignment extending from Gates to Victor via Scottsville, utilizing modern NY386 north of Scottsville and its current alignment east of the village. NY251 was truncated to begin at NY383 in Scottsville on July 1, 1977, at which time the former routing of NY251 between Scottsville and Gates became part of an extended NY386.|$|E
5|$|Gwendolyn: Marko's former fiancée, {{who joins}} The Will's {{pursuit of the}} family. Gwendolyn first appears {{at the end of}} issue #8, having been <b>assigned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Secretary General of Wreath High Command to check on The Will and helps him rescue Slave Girl from Sextillion in order to spur him to {{complete}} his mission. Marko and Alana's wedding rings, which also function as translator devices, were originally those of Gwendolyn's grandparents, who had the rings enchanted with a translator spell because they spoke two different dialects of Wreath's native language. She wears her grandparents' translation pendant around her neck, which was forged with the rings as part of the same set. She resists The Will's advances, though she reveals she loves him while attempting to get medical attention for him after he suffers a near-fatal injury.|$|E
5|$|Logan tells Parker that he {{will not}} be seeing her in the summer because he will be on a surfing trip with Dick. Mac (Tina Majorino) and Max (Adam Rose) spend all their time together. Piz tells Veronica about another {{internship}} in Neptune, but she dodges his attempts to ask which one he should take. Keith meets Liam Fitzpatrick (Rod Rowland), who states that the robberies will not stop. Apollo learns that Veronica was not <b>assigned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> school paper, and Veronica tells him the truth, but he refuses a paternity test. Some people begin to grow dissatisfied with Keith’s handling of the robberies, while Apollo’s father claimant appears in Neptune. Veronica searches for Apollo, learning from his former roommate that Apollo did not actually write the book, and he was never a child soldier. However, Wallace (Percy Daggs III) urges her not to expose him as a hoax, as his book as actually helping charities that aid child soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Lying {{near the}} constellation's {{northern}} border with Telescopium is Alpha Pavonis, {{the brightest star}} in Pavo. Its proper name — Peacock — is an English translation of the constellation's name. It was <b>assigned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office in the late 1930s; the Royal Air Force insisted that all bright stars must have names, the star hitherto having lacked a proper name. Alpha has an apparent (or visual) magnitude of 1.91 and spectral type B2IV. It is a spectroscopic binary system, one estimate placing the distance between the pair of stars as 0.21 astronomical units (AU), or half the distance between Mercury and the Sun. The two stars rotate around each other in a mere 11 days and 18 hours. The star system is located around 180 light years away from Earth.|$|E
5|$|Modi {{became an}} RSS sambhag pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, {{overseeing}} RSS {{activities in the}} areas of Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979 he {{went to work for the}} RSS in Delhi, where he was put to work researching and writing the RSS's version of the history of the Emergency. He returned to Gujarat a short while later, and was <b>assigned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> RSS to the BJP in 1985. In 1987 Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the BJP won comfortably; Modi's planning has been described as the reason for that result by biographers. After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the BJP; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role, and Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the highway}} {{was taken over by}} the state of New York in the 1910s and 1920s. In 1908, the section of modern NY250 in Fairport between Church and High Streets became part of Route20, an {{unsigned}} legislative route <b>assigned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> New York State Legislature. The definition of the route was altered in 1921, taking the route on a more southerly course that used the portion of what is now NY250 between NY31 and NY31F instead through eastern Monroe County. NY250 was assigned to its current alignment as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.|$|E

Shackleton's expertise in the polar regions had been recognised by the War Office, and with the temporary rank of major, he was preparing the contingent for a winter deployment to Murmansk. Shackleton had already recruited several veterans of the Endurance to serve with him and arranged for Worsley, keen for action, {{to be transferred to}} join the contingent.

5|$|Schenn {{played his}} first NHL game on November 26, 2009, against the Vancouver Canucks after being called {{up on an}} {{emergency}} basis and signed to an amateur, one-game try-out contract. At {{the time of his}} debut, Schenn was the third youngest player of all-time to skate for the team. On March 3, 2010, he was signed to a three-year contract with the Kings. After training camp for the 2010–11 season, Schenn made the Kings roster but saw limited playing time. He appeared in nine games with the Kings, and spent time with the Manchester Monarchs of the American Hockey League (AHL) for conditioning purposes. On December 3, 2010, the Kings returned Schenn to the Brandon Wheat Kings. Following the Saskatoon Blades' exit from the 2011 WHL Playoffs, he was <b>assigned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Kings back to the Monarchs on April 17, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Territories {{that had}} been conquered since the early 15th century were governed as condominiums by the cantons. Reeves for these territories were <b>assigned</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Tagsatzung {{for a period of}} two years; the posts changed bi-annually between the cantons. The Aargau had been annexed in 1415. The western part belonged to Bern, while the eastern part {{comprised}} the two condominiums of the former County of Baden in the north and the Freie Ämter ("Free Districts") in the south. The Free Districts had been forcibly recatholized after the Reformation in Switzerland, and the Catholic cantons, especially Lucerne, Zug, and Uri considered these districts part of their sphere of influence and the reeves typically came from these cantons. The Thurgau, which had been annexed in 1460, was also a condominium of the Confederacy.|$|E
