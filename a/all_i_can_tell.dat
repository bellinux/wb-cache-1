500|$|During a {{performance}} at a May 2004 Blue Jays-Rangers game in Toronto, Hung {{revealed that he}} would begin work on a second album. He said that it [...] "will include original songs and cover songs... There will be more bands this time. That's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you." [...] Hung also {{announced that he was}} taking singing lessons before starting the recording sessions. When interviewed by MTV News in June 2004, he said that recording was [...] "gonna be a much slower process than the first time. Right now I'm concentrating on just picking songs... starting to practice them and things like that." [...] Producers submitted the songs to Koch Records, and Hung said in the interview that the label had [...] "some ideas and stuff, and we'll see. It's still early — very, very early." ...|$|E
500|$|.....of [...] that I have read, the {{negative}} ones often {{say something to}} the effect that the book is just like the game, so why read it? What those readers may not realize is that I was hired to novelize the game. That means taking the game and turning it into a book [...] or, put another way, I did what I was hired to do. ...there must be some folks who feel that I wrote the Chief out of character. That's news to me. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you is that the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E
2500|$|<b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> {{you is that}} it {{completely}} and utterly changed my life. I was a white hippie boy and then I saw exit wounds from M1 rifles out of the backs of two people I knew.|$|E
6000|$|... "Had I {{come on the}} {{previous}} day, and had I been able then to <b>tell</b> her <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> her now, would it have made no difference?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It came {{addressed}} in your hand," [...] replied Julia; [...] "we had nearly {{to pull the}} house down to get it in, that is <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you are {{a friend}} to Germany," [...] he replied, [...] "you {{probably}} know <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you. If you are inclined towards friendship with us, then it is as well that you should know everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I shouldn’t be {{much the}} better for that, you see,” says I. “For <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell,</b> {{it might have been}} whole empty yesterday.” ...|$|E
60|$|LEVER. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you is: This {{is as far}} as we've got, and we {{want more}} money before we can get any farther.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shouldn't be {{much the}} better for that, you see," [...] says I. [...] "For <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell,</b> {{it might have been}} whole empty yesterday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{all about}} that young woman," [...] said Emily, with a toss of her head. [...] "And from <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hear <b>tell,</b> she wasn't worth {{fighting}} for. As for you, Bill, I wonder at you; so I do." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Fosbrook kissed her, saying, [...] "My dear little girl, <b>I</b> cannot <b>tell.</b> <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{certainly}} <b>tell</b> you is, that He {{hears the}} prayers of good children, and if it be better for her and for you He will give her back to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{just the}} difficulty. <b>I</b> defend you <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> and <b>tell</b> my {{brothers}} that you've not done anything they wouldn't do in a minute, if {{only half a}} farm depended on it, while, in your case, {{it may be more}} than a hundred." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Alton gravely. [...] "He did, but he tacked {{a kind of}} {{condition}} on to it, and--well, that's about <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you, Charley." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is better}} not to understand," [...] he answered. [...] "It is even better for Joan to believe what she does. That is <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> {{you about}} the new religion," [...] went on Flambeau carelessly. [...] "It claims, of course, that it can cure all {{physical}} diseases." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} queer--you know--these last few days, but no pain." [...] He struck his broad chest several times, {{cleared his throat}} with a {{powerful}} [...] "Hem!" [...] and repeated: [...] "No. No pain. Good {{for a few years}} yet. But I am bothered with <b>all</b> this, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{seen the}} house! Well;--there's {{something}} in that. The house is <b>all</b> there, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you. I'm {{not a bit}} afraid but what you'll like the house. But if we were engaged, I could do everything for you. Where would you be, going into San Francisco all alone? Oh, Miss Melmotte, I do admire you so much!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't talk of it! Now it's <b>all</b> settled, Jamie, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> {{you that}} I'd sooner see you dead {{at my feet}} than that you should break your word to Mary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{you have}} it still,' said Elizabeth; 'deliver it up, if you please; {{it is the best}} of <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you, I had a cursory view of it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have read}} the account of this--terrible thing, and you have heard <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you. Doubtless you have formed some idea {{concerning}} it. Would you mind telling it to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was the lonesomest and craziest sound I've ever heard," [...] {{declared}} Peter, [...] "and that is <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you. It was crazier {{than the}} voice of Old Man Coyote." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must run}} the risk, my dear; your {{intimate}} knowledge of Miss Silvester may be of the greatest assistance {{to me in the}} next step I take. You shall know <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you, but <b>I</b> must warn you first. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only admit you into my confidence by startling you with a great surprise. Do you follow me, so far?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll get <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{first and}} <b>tell</b> on them afterward," [...] he thought, and allowed Tom, and Sam to conduct {{him into the}} {{dormitory}} occupied by the Metropolitan Sextet.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{father did}} some service with our horse, and I fought by his side. We were with Colonel Baillie's force {{when it was}} destroyed, after for two days {{resisting}} the whole of Hyder All's army. Being mounted, we escaped, and reached Madras in safety, after losing half our number. But <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you about, some other day.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you. You must suppose {{an extreme}} case. You may {{take my word}} for it that under certain {{circumstances}} Lucille would have no power to deny them anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] {{said the}} good-natured nun; [...] "surely you shall hear <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you about it; but--" [...] she hesitated timidly, [...] "but I must ask the Mother Superior's leave first." ...|$|E
60|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Nothing {{seems to}} make sense here. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you {{is that she was}} the most impenetrably stupid woman I have ever met in the whole course of my life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh dear, no," [...] Sir Edward answered, confidently, with a {{superior}} smile. [...] "Not the slightest {{chance in the}} world of that. They'd never even dream of it. It's novel, you see, novel, while Walker's is conventional. And they'll take the conventional one. But its a first rate design for <b>all</b> that, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you. <b>I</b> never saw a better one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad of that," [...] said Twinkle, indignantly. [...] "You wouldn't have <b>all</b> the shivers, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you! And you're a disagreeable, ign'rant creature! If {{you had any}} manners at all, you'd treat strangers more politely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Maybe so, maybe so," [...] {{the younger}} man {{answered}} thoughtfully. [...] "But this was not what I wished {{to speak to you}} about. Before I enter your family, your sister and you have a claim to know <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you about my career. Of my worldly prospects I have already spoken to you. There is only one point which I have omitted to mention. I am a widower." ...|$|R
60|$|THE LADY. I {{never read}} the Radical papers. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> {{you is that}} what we women admire in you is not the politician, but the man of action, the heroic warrior, the beau sabreur.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, but {{the natives}} call him Dario, {{and say that}} he is young, and has fair hair, and that she is in love with him. That's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you about the man." ...|$|E
6000|$|Anne sighed bitterly, {{and kissed}} her on the forehead. [...] "You shall know <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you--all I dare tell you," [...] she said, gently. [...] "Don't reproach me. It hurts me more than you think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure as you're born, Collie. He watched us. He saw <b>all</b> your love-makin'. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> {{that by the}} way he walks. It's Buster Jack again! Alas for the new an' noble Jack! I told you, Collie. Now you run on an' {{leave him}} to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't {{hear her}} name," [...] the boy replied. [...] "She's <b>all</b> right, though, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you--a regular slap-up beauty. Such a motor-car, too! Flowers and tables {{and all sorts}} of things inside. By Jove, won't the {{governor}} tear his hair if she goes before you get there!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must know}} that better than <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do, Lady Laura. I will <b>tell</b> you <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you. He invited me to his house and I would not go, because you had {{forbidden}} me. Then he asked me some questions about you. Did I refuse because of you,--or of anything that you had said? If I remember right, I told him that I did fancy {{that you would not}} be glad to see me,--and that therefore I would rather stay away. What was I to say?" ...|$|R
