40|$|The {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} resonant wavelength of vertically coupled microring resonator can be controlled via internal stress caused by the thermo-optic and photo-elastic effects. In the case of strong internal stress, a polarization-independent microring resonator can be realized by controlling the device surface temperature using a heater module; the {{temperature dependence}} of TE and TM polarizations are different due to the internal stress and thus manipulating temperatures, the resonant wavelengths for TE and TM can be equalized at a specific temperature. In this study, the UV trimming of polarization-independent wavelength was demonstrated using UV-sensitive SiON as a core material. The temperature dependence of TE polarization was almost <b>athermalized</b> and that of TM was made negative by controlling internal stress. As a result, the simultaneous realization of the UV trimming and the polarization-independent microring was made possible more easily than before; the UV trimming can be done at room temperature due to the <b>athermalized</b> resonant wavelength for TE polarization...|$|E

40|$|Devices of {{infrared}} {{equipment are}} often operating under complicated environmental conditions. First of all it concerns temperature range which can reach ± 60 °С {{in accordance with}} the requirements. Proceeding from this condition {{one of the most important}} tasks for designing objectives if the infrared devices is to preserve their main characteristics during temperature fluctuations. Temperature changes in internal part of the objective leads to changes in design values of the optical system and it leads consequently to thermal defocusing and appearance of aberrations in image that entails sharp decrease in frequency and energy characteristics of the system. The paper considers a problem on compensation of temperature field influence on image quality of focusing units operating in infrared spectral range when there is uniform temperature distribution in the system. It is expedient to remove dependences of infrared objective characteristics on temperature at the designing stage of focusing unit while using an athermalization method. The paper examines application results of the developed methodology for passive optical athermalization for designing infrared triplet objectives and reveals their advantages in comparison with non-athermalized analogues. Schemes of thermal-independent three-component objectives operating in in the long-distance infrared range of the spectrum 8 – 14 mkm with matrix photo-receivers have been proposed in the paper. The paper provides results of the analysis on influence of temperature field changes on image quality as non-athermalized so <b>athermalized</b> infrared objectives as well.

40|$|The {{correction}} of chromatic aberrations is typically performed using aberration formulas or by using real ray tracing. While {{the use of}} aberration formulas might be effective for some simple optical systems, it has limitations for complex and fast systems. For this reason chromatic aberration correction is usually accomplished with real ray tracing. However, existing optimization tools in lens design software typically mix the {{correction of}} monochromatic and chromatic aberrations by construction of an error function that minimizes both aberrations at the same time. This mixing makes the correction of one aberration type dependent on the correction of the other aberration type. We show two methods to separate the chromatic aberrations correction of a lens system. In the first method we use forward and reverse ray tracing and fictitious nondispersive glasses, to cancel the monochromatic aberration content and allow the ray tracing optimization to focus mainly on the color correction. On the second method we provide the algorithm for an error function that separates aberrations. Furthermore, we also demonstrate how these ray tracing methods {{can be applied to}} <b>athermalize</b> an optical system. We are unaware that these simple but effective methods have been already discussed in detail by other authors...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Astronomical optics may {{encounter}} {{a wide range}} of nighttime temperatures (∼ 10 C to 20 C) at mountaintop observatories. Complex refractive optics used in high-performance spectrographs and focal reducers may perform poorly at temperature extremes unless special care is taken in their design. Refocusing will not always restore image quality, and thermally induced focal length changes may introduce troublesome image motion. We describe the techniques that we have used to predict the thermal behavior of the Binospec Spectrograph, an instrument under development for the converted Multiple Mirror Telescope. This thermal analysis must account for (1) the change in optical power due to thermal expansion of the optical elements, (2) thermal variations in the refractive indices of the optical elements, and (3) element respacings due to the interplay between the thermal expansions of the optical elements and cell materials. Binospec’s multiplets are fluid coupled to reduce the reflection losses that would occur at glass-air surfaces; to <b>athermalize</b> the Binospec optics, we form weak lenses in the optical coupling fluid within multiplets. The large variation of the coupling fluid’s refractive index with temperature allows these weak fluid lenses to correct thermal changes in the optical elements and cell. This athermalization technique is attractive because it introduces no additional mechanical complexity. 1...|$|R

Jointly optimized optical and digital imaging systems exploit the complementary aspects of optics and digital signal processing to form systems with characteristics not possible with traditional optics-only systems.

On the other hand, in optimized optical/digital imaging systems light gathering and large depth of field can be independent parameters.

The article elucidates the results of temperature influence analysis on aberration properties of non-athermalized and <b>athermalized</b> infra-red lenses. The analysis conducted shows that at the temperature change to 40 degrees in the system of typical infra-red lens projected without taking into account temperature influence the system resolvability worsens by several times as a result of thermal misfocusing. At the same time the nature of the field aberrations dependence on the entrance pupil size or corner of optical system eyeshot in the image plane does not change. By using passive optical athermalization methods the dependence of infra-red lenses characteristics on temperature can be eliminated at the stage of focusing system projection. ??????????? ??????? ????????????? ????? ?? ???????? ??????????? ???????????? ?????, ?????????? ? ???????????? ???????????? ?????????, ??? ?????? ??????????? ????????????? ??????????? ? ???????. ? ??????? ???????? ??????????? ????????????? ???? ??????????? ????????? ????????????? ??????? ?? ?????????? ?????????????? ???????????? ??????, ?????????? ? ???????????? ????????????? ????????. ?????? ???????? ?????????? ??????? ??????? ????????? ?????????????? ???? ?? ????????????? ???????? ?????????????????? ? ???????????????? ??-??????????. ??????????? ?????? ???????, ??? ??? ????????? ??????????? ?? ????? ???????? ? ??????? ????????? ????????????? ????????????? ????, ??? ?????????????? ???????? ?? ???? ?????? ??????????? ??????? ???????????, ??????????? ??????????? ??????? ?????????? ? ????????? ??? ?????????? ????????????? ???????????????????. ? ?? ?? ????? ???????? ??????????? ??????? ????????? ?? ??????? ???????? ?????? ??? ???? ???? ?????? ?????????? ??????? ? ????????? ??????????? ?? ??????????. ?????????? ??????????? ????????????? ??-?????????? ?? ??????????? ????????????? ????????? ?? ????? ?????????????? ????????????? ???? ????? ????????????? ??????? ????????? ?????????? ?????????????...|$|E

40|$|Subject of Research. Traditionally, afocal compensators, {{located in}} {{parallel}} or in converging beams, {{are used to}} correct the aberrations of mirror systems. The additional property of afocality gives the possibility to ignore practically the selection of materials in the design, since, in this case, the achromatic correction is achieved automatically. A change in the ambient temperature leads {{to a change in}} the shape of the mirrors and their mutual arrangement, in addition, the optical characteristics of the compensator material change that leads to defocusing. Main Results. Based on the analysis of paraxial formulas valid for the correction of chromatic aberrations and thermal defocusing, we have obtained formulas that enable to evaluate the characteristics of the materials necessary for passive athermalization, that is, to keep image quality when the ambient temperature changes without using a mechanical offset of the sensor. It is shown that in a two-lens compensator used to correct aberrations of two-mirror lens in a converging beam of rays, it is necessary to use a combination of optical glasses and polymer materials for passive athermalization. Practical Relevance. Based on the theoretical correlations obtained, a two-mirror system with an afocal compensator is calculated with a high image quality maintained over a wide temperature range. The use of obtained formulas in practice made it possible to demonstrate the possibility of creation of <b>athermalized</b> catadioptric lens involving combinations of conventional glasses with modern polymeric materials.

40|$|Although laser ranging and {{scanning}} sensors {{are widely}} used {{in a variety of}} industries, a sensor designed for spacecraft operations, including autonomous rendezvous, inspection and servicing remains a challenge. This is primarily due to critical requirements, including the need to have simultaneous high sampling speed, and good range and lateral resolution at both short range of a few meters and at long range of a few hundred meters. A typical LIDAR sensor is not suitable for tracking at the close-in distance, just before rendezvous, or during a critical close-up inspection, since its range resolution is in the tens of millimeters and can only be improved by averaging at the expense of speed. A laser triangulation sensor is capable of simultaneously having both high range resolution (~ 1 mm) and high speed (~ 10 kHz) at short distance. But the range resolution of a triangulation sensor reduces rapidly as range increases, its performance is inferior compared to a LIDAR based sensor at long range. NEPTEC TriDAR (triangulation + LIDAR) is a hybrid sensor that combines a triangulation sensor and a TOF sensor for spacecraft autonomous rendezvous and inspection.

40|$|Substantial {{impacts of}} {{aerosols}} on climate {{and public health}} underscore the need for accurate characterization of atmospheric aerosol distributions and microphysical properties. The Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (MSPI) combines accurate multispectral, multiangle, and polarimetric technologies in a single instrument that images a wide swath on the Earth's surface to advance aerosol remote sensing capabilities. MSPI is required to have 3 % radiometric uncertainty and 0. 005 degree of linear polarization (DoLP) uncertainty. These are difficult requirements that push the limits of available technologies needed to perform space-based polarimetric imaging. This work examines three topics related to MSPI fabrication and calibration: polarization errors and their correction, achromatic, athermal, quarter wave retarder fabrication, and analysis of a polarization state generator (PSG) for MSPI polarization calibration confirmation. MSPI polarization errors may arise from surface geometry of the optical components, coatings, and quarter wave plates (QWPs). Static polarization errors can be calibrated out, but result in decreased SNR. Polarization errors that drift following calibration cannot be corrected, so a sensitivity analysis is used to set time-varying diattenuation and retardance magnitude tolerances. QWPs are required to work {{in concert with the}} PEMs to modulate the linear component of the Stokes vector. A three-material achromatic, <b>athermalized</b> QWP was designed, fabricated and its performance validated. Analysis indicated that the compound QWP was unlikely to meet the requirements if plates were specified by thickness. To address this, a method for QWP fabrication was developed that involves monitoring retardance during polishing. To verify MSPI performance, a PSG was built and calibrated which outputs weakly linearly polarized light with DoLPs varying from 0. 0005 to 0. 4 with 0. 0005 uncertainty by passing nearly unpolarized light through a tilted plane parallel plate. The PSG was intended to act as a calibration standard based on calculated DoLP, but proved difficult to model. Therefore, the DoLP was instead measured to repeatability of 0. 0005. Finally, example spectropolarimetric image data taken with MSPI was presented.
