2500|$|Up until 1890, {{the south}} east of Switzerland was {{extremely}} poorly served by railways. [...] <b>Alpine</b> <b>transit</b> <b>traffic</b> {{was drawn to}} the Gotthard Railway, so that the construction of transcontinental railways in Graubünden appeared not to be economically viable. [...] Only the success of the Landquart-Davos-Bahn (LD) led to a turning point. In 1895, the LD changed its name to Rhaetian Railway (RhB). [...] Two years later, the people of Graubünden decided, in a referendum, that the RhB would come under state ownership. [...] These two changes created suitable conditions for a rapid construction of further RhB lines, which were intended to open up large parts of the Canton.|$|E

This paper investigates whether international policy coordination is appropriate in the case of international <b>transit</b> <b>traffic</b> causing a local environmental externality. This issue is analysed in a two-country model where traffic is used as an input in production. It is found that individual optimization of the countries is likely to result in an outcome with less than optimal international traffic, i. e. too little pollution compared with optimum.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of tolling road use on a {{parallel}} network when different governments have tolling authority on the different links of the network. The paper analyses the tax competition between countries that each maximise the surplus of local users plus tax revenues. Three types of tolling systems are considered: (i) toll discrimination between local and <b>transit</b> <b>traffic,</b> (ii) uniform tolls on local and <b>transit</b> <b>traffic,</b> (iii) only local tolls can be imposed. The paper characterises the optimal toll levels chosen in a Nash equilibrium for the three tolling systems. The numerical illustration shows that introducing transit taxes generates large welfare effects and that toll systems that only apply to local users only generate a low welfare gain. Nash equilibrium toll discrimination between local and <b>transit</b> <b>traffic</b> generates slightly higher welfare than the solution where both tolls have to be uniform...|$|R
