500|$|In 2012, John Tobias said: [...] "If {{you look}} at any other pop culture phenomenon—like if {{you look at}} the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, for instance—it became popular at the time right around when Mortal Kombat became popular, and it had its highs and lows, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> once again talking about a major motion picture. That’s because of its place in pop culture. It’s always there for someone to pick up, polish off, blow the dust off of it, and re-release it. And Mortal Kombat will always be that way. It’ll be around 50 years from now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tom Sawyer, they're {{set down}} on the map, {{and you know it}} {{perfectly}} well, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> and you can see for yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense!" [...] said she. [...] "You {{came for}} the medals, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> at your mercy. Why should you not have them? There is no one to prevent you." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>were,</b> {{right in}} it after all. The blow had fallen, and crushed guilty and {{innocent}} alike.|$|R
60|$|Apartments {{were now}} {{assigned}} {{to them in}} the palace, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> delighted to find a stock of clothes suited for them.|$|R
60|$|So, very carefully, they {{descended the}} stairs and reached the hallway of the house, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> much {{surprised}} by all they saw.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is. This little {{wedge of}} land is all these brave people have saved from the flood. They made their last stand here. The reflux {{from the coast}} caught them here, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> waiting extinction." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, I have. I thought {{them out}} while I was bone-carting, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>are.</b> It is no use our going down below again; for one thing, the journey is too dangerous, and takes too long; and for another, we are safer up above, {{where we have}} plenty to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|His {{companion}} laughed aloud. [...] "I don't wonder, Abner," [...] he cried, [...] "that ye open yer eyes; 't ain't often {{two gentlemen}} {{come on board}} in the night, bag and baggage; but these two stoved in their boat agin our rudder, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> with their craft triced up {{to keep her from}} sinkin'." ...|$|E
60|$|Climbing now became difficult, and in {{a number}} of places each had to help the other along. Then came a wall twelve feet high, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{compelled}} to halt.|$|R
6000|$|Old gods {{in modern}} saints I found, [...] Old creeds in strange disguises; I thought them safely underground, <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>were,</b> all safe <b>and</b> sound, [...] Without {{a sign of}} phthisis.|$|R
60|$|Two {{miles from}} the station the boys found they had quite a climb, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> forced to slow down. A little later they {{reached the top of}} the first hill.|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{think of}} it!" [...] he {{explained}} his wrath. [...] "One {{out of three}} of those curs outside has worked for you or me--lean-bellied, barefooted, poverty-stricken, glad for ten centavos a day if they could only get work. And we've given them steady jobs and {{a hundred and fifty}} centavos a a day, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> yelling for our blood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What, has the fox {{left the}} tigress! Is't so, eh? Are there no judgments? Are the {{innocent}} only haunted? I am innocent! I did not strangle thee! He said rightly, [...] "Beware, beware! they {{who did this}} may do even feller deeds." [...] <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> quick at their damned work. Thy body suffered, great Jabaster, but me they would strangle body and soul!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you see, dad, when he {{went away}} upon this little holiday to Havre he left me to pay {{accounts}} and so on. He {{told me that there}} was enough at the bank for all claims. I had occasion on Tuesday to pay away two cheques, one for L80, and the other for L120, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> returned with a bank notice that we have already overdrawn to the extent of some hundreds." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{coming of}} the old sailor ended the battle, {{so far as the}} bad boys from Rockpoint were concerned. Both Si Peters and Wash Crosby were hauled on board, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> tightly bound, to prevent their making further trouble.|$|R
60|$|Of victory, {{there was}} now no idea; for to conquer, men must act <b>and,</b> <b>here,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> only {{called upon to}} suffer. Presently a wild tumult was heard to the left; and then {{the men of the}} {{scattered}} native regiments burst, in a tumultuous mass, into the ranks of the 66th.|$|R
50|$|Next, Protestant writers {{began to}} {{accumulate}} some alleged proofs of Rome's own variations; <b>and</b> <b>here,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{backed up by}} Richard Simon, a priest of the Paris Oratory {{and the father of}} biblical criticism in France. He accused St Augustine, Bossuet's own special master, of having corrupted the primitive doctrine of grace.|$|R
60|$|Of The Informer and An Anarchist I {{will say}} next to nothing. The {{pedigree}} of these tales is hopelessly complicated and not worth disentangling {{at this distance}} of time. I found them <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>are.</b> The discriminating reader will guess that I have found them within my mind; but how they or their elements came in there I have forgotten for the most part; {{and for the rest}} I really don't see why I should give myself away more than I have done already.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{you would}} have done better by telling me everything; but you left me behind on my own to be your man here. I put my hand to the work I could see before me. I am a sailor. There were two ships to look after. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> both for you, fit to go or to stay, to fight or to run, as you choose." [...] He watched with bated breath the effort Lingard had to make to utter the two words of the desired commendation: ...|$|E
6000|$|Then came a pause, and Mr. Bunting was emboldened {{to lift up}} {{his voice}} and utter politics. [...] "They are getting sense," [...] he said. [...] "They are {{learning}} that a party must have men, men of birth and training. Money and the mob--they've tried to keep things going by playing to fads and class jealousies. And the Irish. And they've had their lesson. How? Why,--we've stood aside. We've left 'em to faddists and fomenters--and the Irish. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>are!</b> It's {{a revolution in the}} party. We've let it down. Now we must pick it up again." ...|$|E
60|$|I saw {{the whole}} thing in a flash. Old man Craye hadn't done a thing to prevent it--apart from being eccentric, he was {{probably}} glad that Edwin had had the sense to pick out anybody half as good a sort--and the marriage had taken place. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> on their honeymoon.|$|R
60|$|The {{bitterness}} {{of the conflict}} had {{for a long time}} ceased; and in the general hope that peace was at hand, the rancor of Cavalier against Roundhead softened down, A great many of the adherents of Charles returned quietly to their homes, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> allowed to settle down without interruption.|$|R
60|$|At a {{point where}} the {{necessary}} route diverged {{from the direction of the}} canal, carriages of Mr. Effingham's were in readiness to receive the travellers, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> also favoured by the presence of Mr. Bragg, who fancied such an attention might be agreeable to the young ladies, as well as to his employer.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't mean exactly that," [...] said Corny; [...] "but {{coats and}} {{trousers}} and frocks, awfully old and patched. And {{nearly all the}} grown-up people there were born in Africa, and rescued by an English man-of-war from a slave-ship that was taking them into slavery, and were brought here and set free. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> and they talk their own language,--only some of them know English, for they've been here over thirty years,--and they all keep together, and have a governor of their own, with a flag-pole before his house, and among them is a real queen, of royal blood!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I waited till a {{woman came}} down with a bundle of faggots, and told her what I wanted. She said {{at first it was}} impossible; but when I said I was {{prepared}} to pay well she altered her tone, and said she would send her husband out to me. He soon came, and after some bargaining he agreed to bring me out the things I wanted for three pounds, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>are.</b> I see you have got a fire alight, so we will make some cakes at once. I have brought a griddle and two horns with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That!" [...] he cried. [...] "Why, in a {{place like}} this, where nobody puts in but gen'lemen of fortune, Silver would fly the Jolly Roger, you don't make no doubt of that. No, that's your friends. There's been blows too, and I reckon your friends has had the best of it; <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> ashore in the old stockade, as was made years and years ago by Flint. Ah, he was the man to have a headpiece, was Flint! Barring rum, his match were never seen. He were afraid of none, not he; on'y Silver--Silver was that genteel." ...|$|E
60|$|Presently he came face to {{face with}} Lois, walking with Vandermere. His face darkened for a moment. He had {{expressed}} his desire that she should see as little of this young man as possible, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>were,</b> not only walking together, but laughing and talking with all the easy naturalness of old acquaintanceship.|$|R
60|$|The air of {{the place}} was now getting too much for me; but I stood deliberating a moment, whether it was {{possible}} for me to drag them out of the vault. But if I did, what then? They would only perish in the street, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> at least protected from the rain; and more than that, might die in seclusion.|$|R
50|$|In some jurisdictions, {{there are}} still places where the logs arrive via {{railroad}} car, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> can <b>be</b> left for rollout scaling.|$|R
6000|$|... "I mane, yer honor, {{that the}} men are cursing and swearing, and saying the divil a bit will they fight any longer. It's rank mutiny and rebellion, yer honor; but there's {{something}} to be said for the poor boys. They have seen all the prize money they have taken spent. Not a thraneen have they touched for months. Their clothes are in rags, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> before a place which there's no more chance of their taking than there is of their flying up to the clouds. And now they hear that, besides the French behind us, there's the nizam with forty thousand of his men marching against us. It's a purty kettle of fish altogether, yer honor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, as it {{is after}} our usual time, and we must break up," [...] {{continued}} the President, producing a basket of flowers from its hiding-place, [...] "I will merely say that I think we have all learned a good deal, and {{will be able to}} work better next winter; for I am sure we shall want to try again, it adds so much sweetness to our own lives to put even a little comfort into the hard lives of the poor. As a farewell token, I sent for some real Plymouth mayflowers, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> a posy apiece, with my love and many thanks for your help in carrying out my plan so beautifully." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gracie's upset, of course, but she'll soon be all right. You mustn't let it {{come between}} you. The thing you've {{got to keep}} {{steadily}} before you is that life's a huge wide adaptable thing. Look at all these people! There's hardly one of them who hasn't got now, or hasn't had, some personal difficulty or trouble before them as big as yours almost; bigger perhaps. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> as lively as fleas. That's what makes the fascination of life--the jolly irony of it all. It would do you {{good to have a}} turn in France, and see yourself in proportion to the whole." [...] He felt her fingers suddenly slip under his arm, and went on with greater confidence: ...|$|E
60|$|The sailors {{were glad}} enough to build another campfire, {{close to the}} landing-place, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> served with all the food and drink they wanted, which put them in good humor. They related the {{particulars}} of how the Emma Brower had gone down, and of how one boat after another had put off in the storm. It had been {{a time of great}} excitement, such as none of them were liable to ever forget.|$|R
6000|$|... "And the {{question}} is," [...] proceeded the steward, [...] "who {{and what is}} there to look to. The eldest son is but a lad, if he were <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> this one is a mere child, and the house <b>is</b> burnt down, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>be,</b> crouching in a hovel, and how is it to be with the land. I'm bound to look after the land. I'm bound to look after my Lady's interest and Sir George's." ...|$|R
50|$|Basel {{entered into}} the Swiss Cup in the round of 64 <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> drawn away against local lower league club FC Birsfelden. The match was a one sided affair and Basel won 8-0. In the round of 32 they had a home fixture against Luzern but were beaten 0-3. The cup season was beended for Basel because the Swiss League Cup was not competed this year and because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not {{qualified}} for European competitions, nor did they enter the Coppa delle Alpi.|$|R
