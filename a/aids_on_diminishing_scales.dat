40|$|Does {{diaspora}} imply a homeland? For {{a number}} of scholars who pioneered the growth of diasporic studies in the 1990 s this was {{the sine qua non}} of the concept. Under the weight of social constructionist critics, who sought to deconstruct the foundational ideas of homeland and community, more complex and vaguer ideas of homeland and home emerged. These are characterized here as ‘solid’, ‘ductile’ and ‘liquid’, <b>on</b> a <b>diminishing</b> <b>scale</b> from historical reality to postmodern virtuality. I show that all three versions of home/homeland have some historical and empirical support, though resist pure social constructivism. There is also some evidence that solid notions homeland are gaining increasing attention...|$|R

60|$|Such is {{the scale}} on which nature labors in the wilderness! I have seen insects {{fluttering}} {{in the air}} at particular seasons, and at particular places, until they formed little clouds; a sight every one must have witnessed on many occasions; and as those insects appear, <b>on</b> their <b>diminished</b> <b>scale,</b> so did the pigeons appear to us at the roost of Mooseridge. We passed an hour in the town of birds, finding our tongues and our other faculties, as we became accustomed to our situation. In a short time, even Dus grew as composed as at all comported with the excitement natural to one in such a place; and we studied the habits of the pretty animals with a zest that I found so much the greater for studying them in her company. At the end of the hour we left the hill, our departure producing no more sensation in that countless tribe of pigeons than our arrival.|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of the Russian army’s personnel has undergone a major transformation in recent years. The Armed Forces {{are no longer a}} downsized continuation of the Soviet-era mass army, but are gradually becoming a de facto professional army in which conscription, now employed <b>on</b> a <b>diminishing</b> <b>scale,</b> will primarily constitute a first step towards a continued professional military career. The cornerstone for the process of professionalisation has been laid by a personnel reform which cut the number of officer posts by nearly half and considerably restricted the recruitment of new officers, thus restoring traditional proportions to the {{structure of}} the officer corps. The plans to ultimately implement a manning system based predominantly on contract service are a natural consequence of these changes. The ongoing professionalisation of the Russian Armed Forces should be treated as a conscious effort which is mainly necessitated by global trends: despite the demographic changes taking place, Russia could still maintain an army with a declared strength of one million soldiers, most of them conscripts...|$|R
5000|$|As late as {{the early}} 1900s most European armies still {{retained}} a nominal division of mounted troops according to the size and weight of the men,into light cavalry (reconnaissance, scouting and screening), medium cavalry (attack and defense of specific locations) and heavy cavalry (shock action on the battlefield). While colonial warfare had led to a blurring of these distinctions in the British army, tradition remained strong in the cavalry arm of some other nations. As an example, the Imperial German army maintained a marked difference between the sizes and weights {{of the men and}} horses allocated to the hussar regiments that made up its light cavalry and those of the other two categories. The early weeks of World War I saw light cavalry attempting to continue its long established function of being the [...] "eyes and ears" [...] of the respective main armies. However, despite some early success, the advent of trench warfare and aircraft observation quickly rendered this role obsolete, except to an extent in the Middle East in 1917, and in Eastern Europe where light cavalry mounted actions <b>on</b> a <b>diminishing</b> <b>scale</b> continued to occur until the revolution of 1917 took Russia out of the war.|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} we were off betimes, {{intending}} to push through {{the mountains and the}} custom-houses that day. The country was wild and far from fruitful, though there were bits of naked mountain, through which the road wound in a way to recall, <b>on</b> a greatly <b>diminished</b> <b>scale</b> however, that peculiar charm of the Apennines. The villages were clean but dreary, and nowhere, for leagues, did we see a country that was genial, or likely to reward agriculture. This passage of the Jura is immeasurably inferior to that by Salins and Neufchâtel. At first I was afraid it was my worn-out feelings that produced the impression; but, by close comparisons, and by questioning my companions, some of whom scarcely recollected the other road, I feel certain that such is the fact. Indeed it would be like comparing a finished painting to an esquisse.|$|R
60|$|Mademoiselle Hennequin, I took {{occasion}} to remark, occupied {{much of the}} attention of Betts Shoreham, at Mrs. Leamington's ball. They understood each other perfectly, though the young man could not get over the feeling created by the governess's manner when she first met with me. Throughout the evening, indeed, her eye seemed studiously averted from me, as if she struggled to suppress certain sentiments or sensations, that she was unwilling to betray. Now, these sentiments, if sentiments they were, or sensations, as they were beyond all dispute, might be envy--repinings at another's better fortunes--or they might be excited by philosophical and commendable reflections touching those follies which so often lead the young and thoughtless into extravagance. Betts tried hard to believe them the last, though, in his inmost heart, he would a thousand times rather that the woman he loved should smile on a weakness of this sort, in a girl of her own age, than that she should show herself to be prematurely wise, if it was wisdom purchased {{at the expense of}} the light-heartedness and sympathies of her years and sex. <b>On</b> a <b>diminished</b> <b>scale,</b> I had awakened in his bosom some such uneasy distrust as the pocket-handkerchief of Desdemona is known to have aroused in that of the Moor.|$|R
40|$|A fractal is a {{function}} or {{a process in which}} an identical motif repeats itself <b>on</b> an ever <b>diminishing</b> <b>scale.</b> The motif of a fractal can be a feature influenced by chance. Fractals can be found in nature everywhere, for instance the surface of the moon is a fractal, where the motif of craters is repeated in a scale from inches to miles. It is created by random collisions with space objects. Fractals are also called self-similar, because they show the same picture when looking at them in different scales. Fractals {{can be found in the}} load profile of data and video traffic, too. Fractal behavior has serious consequences for the modeling, design and operation of packet switched networks like ATM. They are: 1) no smoothing effect while traffic is multiplexed and, 2) unpredictable burst lengths. This leads to difficulties in buffer dimensioning and in traffic control schemes. Understanding and modeling the fractal behavior is a new research challenge. More knowledge is needed to understand [...] ...|$|R
