It was launched by the Soviet Union on 19 April 1975 from Kapustin Yar using a Kosmos-3M launch vehicle. During President Vladimir Putin's visit to India in December 2004, two space-related bilateral agreements were signed viz. Inter-Governmental umbrella Agreement on co-operation in the outer space for peaceful purposes and the Inter Space <b>Agency</b> <b>Agreement</b> on co-operation in the Russian satellite navigation system GLONASS. Subsequently, a number of follow-up agreements on GLONASS have been signed. In November 2007, the two countries have signed an agreement on joint lunar exploration.

2500|$|In August 1920, the NDL made an <b>agency</b> <b>agreement</b> {{with the}} U.S. Mail Steamship Co. (beginning in 1921, United States Lines). This made it {{possible}} to resume transatlatic service from Bremerhaven to New York with the former Rhein, now sailing under the US flag as the Susquehanna. The unfinished Columbus had been awarded to Great Britain after the war and was bought in 1920 by White Star, which had lost significant tonnage in the war and also wished {{to make up for the}} pre-war loss of the Titanic. However, work at Danzig proceeded very slowly. Finally in autumn 1921 the so-called Columbus Agreement was reached, under which the German government and NDL undertook to facilitate rapid completion of the Columbus in exchange for the British government returning ownership to the NDL of six smaller ships which had spent the war years in South America: the postal steamers Seydlitz and Yorck, the Gotha, and the freighters Göttingen, Westfalen and Holstein. The company also began to build new freighters and passenger ships and to buy back other ships. In late 1921, service to South America was resumed with the Seydlitz, and in early 1922, East Asian service with the Westfalen. On 12 February 1922, service to New York with NDL's own ships resumed with Seydlitz. The other ship of the Columbus class, the [...] former Hindenburg, was completed in 1924 and named Columbus; she was placed in scheduled transatlantic passenger service.|$|E

40|$|It is {{a long-standing}} {{antitrust}} principle that agency relationships {{are exempt from}} price-fixing violations. But the agency relationship must be "genuine. " To discern genuine <b>agency</b> <b>agreements,</b> the prevailing approach adopted in both the United States and the European Union focuses on whether the agent has incurred any specific risk or cost {{in relation to the}} distribution of the manufacturer's goods. Yet this approach has tended to obscure the economic nature of agency relationships. The real question to ask is not whether the agent has incurred any specific cost or risk, but instead whether, in a given case, an agency model, rather than a distribution model, actually constitutes a more efficient form for organizing distribution functions between the contracting parties. In fact, over {{a quarter of a century}} ago, Judge Richard Posner proposed a business justification approach for analyzing <b>agency</b> <b>agreements</b> in Morrison v. Murray Biscuit. Building on Morrison, and on the economic literature of property rights and agency problems, this article explores the fundamental question of how parties choose to enter into an optimal contractual form, and, moreover, proposes an economic approach to discern genuine <b>agency</b> <b>agreements.</b> It also calls for revision of the current EU Vertical Guidelines on <b>agency</b> <b>agreements,</b> which are so stringent that they deter businesses unnecessarily from entering into agency arrangements.
