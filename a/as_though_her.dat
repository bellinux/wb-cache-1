500|$|Some reviewers {{commented on}} the part in which Gaga says she's [...] "had a couple of drinks". Lipshutz wrote that Gaga sounded [...] "loose and light-hearted, letting her {{audience}} twirl around on the dance floor". Cragg said it sounded <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> vocals had been [...] "covertly recorded during a drunken game of truth or dare".|$|E
500|$|Smetana's biographers {{describe}} him as physically frail and unimpressive in appearance yet, at least in his youth, he had a joie-de-vivre that women evidently found attractive. He was also excitable, passionate and strong-willed, determined to make his career in music whatever the hardships, over the wishes of his father who wanted {{him to become a}} brewer or a civil servant. Throughout his career he stood his ground; when under the severest of criticism for the [...] "Wagnerism" [...] in Dalibor he responded by writing Libuše, even more firmly based on the scale and concept of Wagnerian music drama. His personal life became stressful; his marriage to Bettina was loveless, and effectively broke down altogether in the years of illness and relative poverty towards the end of his life. Little of his relationships with his children is on record, although [...] on the day that he was transferred to the asylum, Žofie was [...] "crying <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> heart would break".|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Fool in Love" [...] is a rhapsodic ballad, which {{incorporates}} acoustic {{and electric}} guitars, synthesizers and drums. Lyrically, Rihanna tells {{of how she}} has met a relatively good man who her parents do not approve of, but requests that they accept her decision {{to be with him}} due to their love for each other, despite familial concerns. Rihanna insists that she is in love, singing [...] "Papa he's quite a man, he adores me/ He's my biggest fan." [...] She then claims that he has taken a hold over her, singing [...] "We're too far down the hole/ He's got a hold on my soul." [...] Rihanna's vocal performance in the song was described as the singer's [...] "biggest ornamented" [...] song by Robert Everett-Green of The Globe and Mail, as well as noting that the singer emotes a sense of fatality in her vocals during the bass sequences in the song. [...] "Fool in Love" [...] displays Rihanna emoting a vulnerable style of singing, due to the lyrical content and mood in the song, which can be heard in the lyrics [...] "Papa, are you ashamed of how your little girl turned out?" [...] due to how the singer feels <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> parents are disappointed in her choice of man. Robert Copsey for Digital Spy commented that Rihanna appeared to be channelling Madonna on the song.|$|E

2500|$|The twelfth {{flotilla}} {{commanded by}} Captain Stirling on the destroyer leader Faulknor was following behind the First Battle Squadron. This had fallen behind the main fleet because damage to Marlborough had reduced her speed, so the destroyers were now some 10 miles behind Jellicoe. The flotilla had thirteen 'M' class destroyers plus Faulknor and another destroyer leader, Marksman. At 0143 Obedient sighted ships steering ESE in the slowly lightening dawn. The unidentified ships gave the incorrect challenge signal and an attack was begun in near ideal conditions on German dreadnought and pre-dreadnought battleships. The pre-dreadnought Pommern {{was struck by}} a torpedo. One of Obedient's officers reported: [...] "Right amidship in the Pommern appeared a dull red ball of fire. It spread fore and aft and flared up the masts in big red tongues of flame, uniting in a black cloud of smoke and sparks. Then one saw the ends of the ship come up <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> back was broken before the mist shut her out of view". Six destroyers fired seventeen torpedoes [...] at the German ships, the other destroyers being driven away by gunfire. Stirling attempted to report the engagement, making three reports, but none was received by Jellicoe, either because of damage to his radio aerials or because of German jamming. Had the signals been received, it would still have been possible for Jellicoe to turn his fleet and intercept the German ships before they reached the safety of their own minefields at 0330.|$|E

60|$|A gold purse {{was passed}} to him, {{with a small}} {{monogram}} inscribed. Again Pauline slowly, and even <b>as</b> <b>though</b> against <b>her</b> will, described correctly the purse and its contents.|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} {{she put the}} same question, and looked up despairingly in his face, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> whole life hung upon his reply.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes sir; he have." [...] This {{she said}} in a very decided tone, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> master need trouble himself no further about her husband.|$|E
60|$|Mr. and Mrs. Cluyme {{exchanged}} a glance of consternation. Then Mrs. Cluyme sat down again, rather heavily, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> legs {{had refused to}} hold her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must see}} him," [...] said Lady Hartletop. Lady Glencora put both her hands {{together}} piteously, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> deprecating <b>her</b> visitor's wrath. [...] "I must insist on seeing him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Lawrie's wedding!" [...] said John Gordon. [...] "Is Miss Lawrie to be married?" [...] And he {{purposely}} {{looked at}} <b>her,</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> asking <b>her</b> the question. But she answered never a word.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} me <b>as</b> <b>though</b> in surprise. <b>Her</b> eyes were like {{the eyes of a}} child.|$|R
6000|$|For a while Miss Trelawny {{stood looking}} at her father, with her brows wrinkled. Then, turning to me, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> mind were made up, she said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{room was}} in great disorder. That looks <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> flight was unpremeditated. Almost {{as though she}} got a sudden warning to go from some one." ...|$|E
60|$|All that day, in {{the teeth}} of a keen winter wind, I hugged myself in my plaid, and it was <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> arms were flung around me.|$|E
60|$|He {{shook his}} head, and softly beat upon the hand he held, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> mutely asking <b>her</b> commiseration.|$|R
60|$|She glanced {{towards the}} bell. He {{moved to the}} edge of the table <b>as</b> <b>though</b> to {{intercept}} <b>her.</b>|$|R

60|$|Virginia rose in her place. It seemed <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> {{appearance}} was woebegone enough {{to soften the}} heart of any man, but Phineas Duge looked into her face unmoved.|$|E
6000|$|... "Please don't move," [...] she exclaimed, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> coming {{were the}} most natural thing in the world. [...] "I am going to sit down with you, if I may!" ...|$|E
60|$|The Baroness rose <b>as</b> <b>though</b> unwillingly to <b>her</b> feet. She {{dropped the}} {{slightest}} of curtseys and resumed her place.|$|R
60|$|When {{the final}} stormy note was still, Viola {{remained}} on <b>her</b> stool, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> waiting for <b>her</b> critic to applaud.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Arabin did sit down, {{and as he}} did so Mrs. Bold got up <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{to follow}} <b>her</b> neighbour.|$|R
60|$|So Mary rallied herself, and in {{five minutes}} more was as eager in giving her {{directions}} to Cicely and to the Curlls <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> heart had not recently failed her.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} Francesca felt a {{stifling}} sensation of weakness, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> heart {{was going to}} stop beating. Then she sat forward in her chair and spoke with energy, almost fierceness.|$|E
6000|$|... "What a jester you are becoming, ma mie," [...] {{he laughed}} and at the sound she shuddered again and drew {{mechanically}} nearer to the fire <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>her</b> shuddering {{was the result of}} cold.|$|E
