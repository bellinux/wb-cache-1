25|$|The Sioux {{people of}} South Dakota {{believed}} {{that in the}} first creatures in creation were the insects and reptiles, who were ruled by the Water Monster Unktehi.

The physical bodies of the Thunder Beings killed by the lightning, including Unktehi, also ended up being buried. The Sioux believe that earth has a history of four distinct ages. These events occurred during the Age of Rock. This portrayal of the Thunder Birds may also have been influenced by associations of fossils of Pteranodon with marine reptiles of the same age in the western United States.|$|E

25|$|Three angles are {{the angles}} of some {{triangle}} if {{and only if}} their sum is 180° (π radians). What condition on 12 angles is necessary and sufficient for them to be the 12 angles of some tetrahedron? Clearly the sum of the angles of any side of the tetrahedron must be 180°. Since there are four such triangles, there are four such constraints on sums of angles, and the number of degrees of freedom is thereby reduced from 12 to 8. The four relations given by this sine law further reduce the number of degrees of freedom, from 8 down to not 4 but 5, since the fourth constraint is not independent of the first three. Thus the space of <b>all</b> <b>shapes</b> of tetrahedra is 5-dimensional.|$|E

However, unlike in Valdivia, the rain falls more or less evenly throughout the year in Puerto Aisén. The summer months average 206.1 millimeters, whereas the winter months average 300 millimeters. The temperatures at sea level in Puerto Aisén average 13.6°C in the summer months and 4.7°C in the winter months. Although the area generally is chilly and wet, the combination of channels, fjords, snowcapped mountains, and islands of <b>all</b> <b>shapes</b> and sizes within such a narrow space makes for breathtaking views. The area is still heavily forested, although some of the native species of trees that grow in the central and southern parts of the country have given way to others better adapted to a generally colder climate.|$|E

The Banjo-Kazooie series continued to be developed with the release of the handheld games [...] and Banjo-Pilot for the Game Boy Advance. A third main game, , was released for the Xbox 360 in 2008.

500|$|The {{historian}} George Bott regards John Dalton (1709–63) and John Brown (1715–66) as {{the pioneers}} of tourism in the Lake District. Both wrote works praising the majesty of the scenery, and their enthusiasm prompted others to visit the area. The poet Thomas Gray published an account of a five-day stay in Keswick in 1769, in which he described {{the view of the}} town as [...] "the vale of Elysium in all its verdure", and was lyrical about the beauties of the fells and the lake. His journal was widely read, and was, in Bott's phrase, [...] "an effective public relations job for Keswick." [...] Painters such as Thomas Smith of Derby and William Bellers also contributed to the influx of visitors; engravings of their paintings of Cumberland scenery sold in large numbers, further enhancing the fame of the area. In 1800 the Romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote, [...] "It is no small advantage that for two-thirds of the year we are in complete retirement – the other third is alive & swarms with Tourists of <b>all</b> <b>shapes</b> & sizes." [...] Coleridge had moved to Keswick in that year, and together with his fellow Lake Poets (see below) was possibly the strongest influence on the public esteem of Keswick and the Lake District.|$|E

It does take place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's all connected. But that doesn't necessarily mean that we would look up in the sky and see [...] It's just a different part of New York that we have not yet seen in the Marvel movies." [...] In January 2015, Netflix COO Ted Sarandos said Netflix planned to release a Marvel series approximately a year apart from each other after Daredevils April 2015 release. A year later, Sarandos noted that the release schedules of the Marvel Netflix series are dependent on the [...] "long production times and long post times. In some cases, when we have characters crossover, it makes it more difficult to manage production. It's not the goal to put out {{more than one or two}} [...] year ... The complex one is really The Defenders. The Defenders production schedule will determine a lot of the season 2 and 3 output of those shows." [...] He also noted on potential spin-offs that [...] "all the characters in the universe could also spin out" [...] into their own series at some point, with Netflix ordering Marvel's The Punisher, a spin-off from Daredevil, that April. Sarandos later stated that Netflix was trying to close the gap between releases of Marvel seasons, but would always prioritize the quality of the series over higher numbers of releases per year. He also said that Netflix was open to exploring the MCU beyond the Defenders series, including potential crossovers with ABC's Marvel series.|$|E
