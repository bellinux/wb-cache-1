5|$|On March 3, 2010, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter passed <b>another</b> <b>significant</b> milestone, having {{transmitted}} over 100 terabits of data back to Earth, {{which was}} more than all other interplanetary probes sent from Earth combined.|$|E
5|$|The Sabah State Mosque in Sembulan is {{the main}} mosque in the city. The City Mosque on Likas Bay is <b>another</b> <b>significant</b> {{landmark}} in the city.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} component to the Holocaust in Lithuania {{was that the}} occupying Nazi German administration fanned antisemitism by blaming the Soviet regime's recent annexation of Lithuania, a year earlier, on the Jewish community. <b>Another</b> <b>significant</b> factor was the large {{extent to which the}} Nazis' design drew upon the physical organization, preparation and execution of their orders by local Lithuanian auxiliaries of the Nazi occupation regime.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>significant</b> human {{impact is}} roadkill—dead turtles, {{especially}} females, are commonly seen on summer roads. In addition to direct killing, roads genetically isolate some populations. Localities {{have tried to}} limit roadkill by constructing underpasses, highway barriers, and crossing signs. Oregon has introduced public education on turtle awareness, safe swerving, and safely assisting turtles across the road.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>significant</b> race {{run at the}} new {{track was}} the Grade 2 stakes Washington Park Handicap for three-year-olds and up. It was first held at Washington Park in 1926, and {{continued}} to be held there until 1958, when it was moved to Arlington Park, where {{it continues to be}} held to the present day and commemorates the Washington Park racetrack.|$|E

5|$|Brady v. Maryland (1963) is <b>another</b> <b>significant,</b> {{specific}} criminal procedural right {{guaranteed by}} the due process clauses. Brady requires a criminal conviction to be reversed if the government withholds exculpatory (or impeachment) material, within the government's possession, from the defendant, {{and there is a}} reasonable probability that, if such material had been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different ("materiality"). Brady is a holistic, rather than piece-by-piece, inquiry.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there is}} <b>another</b> <b>significant</b> {{difference}} in Napoleon himself, {{in the way}} he holds himself. David's Napoleon is flamboyant, confident in his leadership of the French army, and in his ability to cross the Alps and defeat the Austrians in Italy. Delaroche's Napoleon is instead downcast, gaunt and embittered by the harsh cold. His eyes and expressionless face evidence his weariness, his tiredness a result of the long and unstable trek.|$|E
5|$|Perl 5.004 was {{released}} on May 15, 1997, and included among other things the UNIVERSAL package, giving Perl a base object to which all classes were automatically derived {{and the ability to}} require versions of modules. <b>Another</b> <b>significant</b> development was the inclusion of the CGI.pm module, which contributed to Perl's popularity as a CGI scripting language.|$|E
50|$|Another {{consideration}} is how vulnerability {{to climate change}} varies with scale. At local scales, extreme weather events can have a significant impact, especially in vulnerable locations. <b>Another</b> potentially <b>significant</b> impact is the long-term effect of sea-level rise on low-lying coastal areas.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Another</b> more <b>significant</b> {{quote from}} the book:"The subject of drama is The Lie.

5|$|South Bend {{benefited from}} its {{location}} on the Michigan Road, the main north–south artery of northern Indiana in the 19th century. <b>Another</b> <b>significant</b> development occurred near South Bend in 1842, when Father Edward Sorin founded the University of Notre Dame {{just north of the}} town. It became {{a major factor in the}} area's economy and culture.|$|E
5|$|The design's lack of {{structural}} integrity {{is seen as}} <b>another</b> <b>significant</b> weakness of the Quad ESL-63 since its inception, and lived on in its various successors. Other shortcomings include very limited sound pressure levels, meaning that it won't play loud, and its bass response was lacking. In addition, one reviewer experienced problems with shut-downs playing music with high intensity bass drums.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of ethylenediamine dihydroiodide, provided as a nutritional supplement for livestock, consumes {{a large portion}} of available iodine. <b>Another</b> <b>significant</b> use is a catalyst for the {{production of}} acetic acid by the Monsanto and Cativa processes. In these technologies, which support the world's demand for acetic acid, hydroiodic acid converts the methanol feedstock into methyl iodide, which undergoes carbonylation. Hydrolysis of the resulting acetyl iodide regenerates hydroiodic acid and gives acetic acid.|$|E

25|$|Chart shaping {{involves}} {{examining the}} placement of the planets in the chart by the aspects they form and by their positioning in the chart relative to one <b>another.</b> Any <b>significant</b> patterns or 'shapes' which occur in the chart are then interpreted for their importance to the personality of the native.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{especially}} <b>significant</b> work of Le Gallienne is his song-cycle, Four Holy Sonnets of John Donne, for {{low voice}} and piano. He also wrote music for Tim Burstall's film The Prize (1960), which won {{a bronze medal}} at the Venice Film Festival, and worked with Burstall on two other films.|$|R
5|$|A {{paper mill}} built in Partington more than 250years ago {{was the first}} factory in Trafford. The {{completion}} of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894 transformed Partington into a major coal-exporting port and attracted a range of other industries. Until 2007 Shell Chemicals UK operated a major petrochemicals manufacturing complex in Carrington, Partington's closest neighbour, to the east. The gas storage facility in the north-eastern corner of the town was once a gasworks and <b>another</b> <b>significant</b> employer.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture is <b>another</b> <b>significant</b> {{source of}} the Sava River basin surface water pollution, {{specifically}} through livestock manure production. It is estimated that the nutrient pollution levels generated by manure production equal 32,394tonnes of nitrogen and 3,784tonnes of phosphorus per year. As a consequence, the Sava River is microbiologically polluted in areas affected by the nutrient pollution. One such part of the river is the lowermost part of its course between Šabac and Belgrade, where acceptable freshwater bacterial counts are exceeded.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>significant</b> general from Massachusetts, Maj. Gen. Edwin Vose Sumner, born in 1797, was {{the oldest}} general officer with a field command {{on either side of}} the war. He had served in the Regular Army during the Mexican-American war and {{numerous}} campaigns in the West. Sumner commanded the II Corps during the Maryland Campaign and later the Right Grand Division of the Army of the Potomac during the Fredericksburg Campaign. Following the Battle of Fredericksburg, he resigned his command in January 1863 and was to be transferred to command the Department of the Missouri, but died of a heart attack en route on March 21, 1863.|$|E
50|$|Several anthropologists {{who were}} not {{directly}} associated with the Manchester University anthropology department are sometimes considered members of the Manchester School, particularly those who were associated with Gluckman or his students through the Rhodes-Livingstone Institute. Some others, such as Edmund Leach, at one period or <b>another</b> were <b>significant</b> interlocutors of the Manchester School.|$|R
5000|$|IN 2007, {{the club}} was renamed as Leeds Carnegie in a deal with Leeds Metropolitan University, which took a 51% stake. Carnegie College {{is part of the}} university's sport department. Leeds {{director}} of rugby Stuart Lancaster said: [...] "I am delighted by the announcement. This is <b>another</b> hugely <b>significant</b> step in our evolution." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{culturally}} <b>significant</b> constraint {{occurred in}} France. In the late seventeenth century (1697 to be exact), Italian companies were prohibited from appearing in France, so native actors - strolling players going from fairground to fairground, market place to market place - {{took over the}} Italian plays and made the roles their own with great success.|$|R
5|$|Despite initial hostilities, good {{relations}} between the Portuguese and Chinese would resume in 1549 with annual Portuguese trade missions to Shangchuan Island, following an event where the Portuguese helped Ming authorities eliminate coastal pirates. In 1554, Leonel de Sousa—a later Governor of Macau— established positive relations through an agreement with Cantonese authorities and in 1557 the Ming court finally gave consent for a permanent and official Portuguese trade base at Macau. Although Fernão Pires de Andrade and his Portuguese comrades {{were the first to}} open up China to the West, <b>another</b> <b>significant</b> diplomatic mission reaching all the way to Beijing would not be carried out until an Italian, the Jesuit Matteo Ricci (15521610) ventured there in 1598.|$|E
5|$|Estimates for the Earth's crustal content {{range from}} 20 to 70 ppm by weight. In keeping with its name, lithium forms a minor part of igneous rocks, {{with the largest}} {{concentrations}} in granites. Granitic pegmatites also provide the greatest abundance of lithium-containing minerals, with spodumene and petalite being the most commercially viable sources. <b>Another</b> <b>significant</b> mineral of lithium is lepidolite. A newer source for lithium is hectorite clay, the only active development of which is through the Western Lithium Corporation in the United States. At 20mg lithium per kg of Earth's crust, lithium is the 25th most abundant element.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech had <b>another</b> <b>significant</b> {{win over}} the Clemson Tigers on October 29, 2011 at Bobby Dodd Stadium. Clemson was ranked nationally No. 5 at the time, and the Tigers {{suffered}} their first defeat of the season {{at the hands of}} the Yellow Jackets. Tevin Washington led the Yellow Jackets to a 31–17 upset victory by rushing for 176 yards on 27 carries and a touchdown, which was the most rushing yards ever by a Georgia Tech quarterback. In addition, Clemson's offense was almost completely shutdown by Georgia Tech's defense in the first half, and the Tigers were plagued by turnovers, which contributed to the win for the Yellow Jackets.|$|E
