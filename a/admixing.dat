40|$|Abstract Background Admixture mapping is a {{powerful}} gene mapping approach for an <b>admixed</b> population formed from ancestral populations with different allele frequencies. The power of this method relies {{on the ability of}} ancestry informative markers (AIMs) to infer ancestry along the chromosomes of <b>admixed</b> individuals. In this study, more than one million SNPs from HapMap databases and simulated data have been interrogated in <b>admixed</b> populations using various measures of ancestry informativeness: Fisher Information Content (FIC), Shannon Information Content (SIC), F statistics (F ST), Informativeness for Assignment Measure (I n), and the Absolute Allele Frequency Differences (delta, δ). The objectives are to compare these measures of informativeness to select SNP markers for ancestry inference, and to determine the accuracy of AIM panels selected by each measure in estimating the contributions of the ancestors to the <b>admixed</b> population. Results F ST and I n had the highest Spearman correlation and the best agreement as measured by Kappa statistics based on deciles. Although the different measures of marker informativeness performed comparably well, analyses based on the top 1 to 10 % ranked informative markers of simulated data showed that I n was better in estimating ancestry for an <b>admixed</b> population. Conclusions Although millions of SNPs have been identified, only a small subset needs to be genotyped in order to accurately predict ancestry with a minimal error rate in a cost-effective manner. In this article, we compared various methods for selecting ancestry informative SNPs using simulations as well as SNP genotype data from samples of <b>admixed</b> populations and showed that the I n measure estimates ancestry proportion (in an <b>admixed</b> population) with lower bias and mean square error. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceNeighbor-joining {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used methods for {{constructing}} evolutionary trees. This approach from phylogenetics is often employed in population genetics, where distance matrices obtained from allele frequencies are used to produce a representation of population relationships in the form of a tree. In phylogenetics, the utility of neighbor-joining derives partly from a result that for a class of distance matrices including those that are additive or tree-like-generated by summing weights over the edges connecting pairs of taxa in a tree to obtain pairwise distances-application of neighbor-joining recovers exactly the underlying tree. For populations within a species, however, migration and admixture can produce distance matrices that reflect more complex processes than those obtained from the bifurcating trees typical in the multispecies context. <b>Admixed</b> populations-populations descended from recent mixture of groups that have long been separated-have been observed to be located centrally in inferred neighbor-joining trees, with short external branches incident to the path connecting their source populations. Here, using a simple model, we explore mathematically the behavior of an <b>admixed</b> population under neighbor-joining. We show that with an additive distance matrix, a population <b>admixed</b> among two source populations necessarily lies on the path between the sources. Relaxing the additivity requirement, we examine the smallest nontrivial case-four populations, one of which is <b>admixed</b> between two of the other three-showing that the two source populations never merge with each other before one of them merges with the <b>admixed</b> population. Furthermore, the distance on the constructed tree between the <b>admixed</b> population and either source population is always smaller than the distance between the source populations, and the external branch for the <b>admixed</b> population is always incident to the path connecting the sources. We define three properties that hold for four taxa and that we hypothesize are satisfied under more general conditions: antecedence of clustering, intermediacy of distances, and intermediacy of path lengths. Our findings can inform interpretations of neighbor-joining trees with <b>admixed</b> groups, and they provide an explanation for patterns observed in trees of human populations...|$|R

Cement paste specimens <b>admixed</b> with a fixed quantity of sodium chloride and varying dosages of sodium sulphate or magnesium sulphate were prepared.

The chloride concentration increased with increasing quantity of sodium sulphate contamination.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of corrosion inhibitor interaction with reinforcing steel are investigated {{in the present}} work, with particular emphasis on effects associated with corrosion inhibitors <b>admixed</b> into Portland cement paste. The principal objective in reinforcing steel corrosion inhibition for Portland cement concrete is observed to be preservation of the naturally passive steel surface condition established by the alkaline environment. Introduction of chloride ions to the steel surface accelerates damage to the passive film. Excessive damage to the passive film leads to loss of passivity and a destabilization of conditions that facilitate repair of the passive film. Passive film preservation in presence of chloride ions is achieved either through stabilization of the passive film or by modification of the chemical environment near the steel surface. ^ Availability of inhibitors to the steel surface and their tendency to stabilize passive film defects are observed to be of critical importance. Availability of <b>admixed</b> corrosion inhibitors to the passive film is affected by binding of inhibitors during cement paste hydration. It is determined that pore solution concentrations of inorganic <b>admixed</b> inhibitors tend to be lower than the <b>admixed</b> concentration, while pore solution concentrations of organic <b>admixed</b> inhibitors tend {{to be higher than}} the <b>admixed</b> concentration. A fundamental difference of inhibitor function is observed between film-forming and defect stabilizing corrosion inhibitors. Experiments are conducted using coupons of reinforcing steel that are exposed to environments simulating chloride-contaminated Portland cement concrete. A study of the steel/cement paste interface is also performed, and compounds forming at this interface are identified using X-Ray diffraction. ...|$|R

40|$|Cement {{stabilization}} is extensively used {{to improve}} engineering properties of soft saline clays. The effect of salinity, which is modified by geological and climate changes, on the strength development in cement <b>admixed</b> saline clay is investigated in this paper. For a particular curing time and salt content, the strength development in saline clay <b>admixed</b> with cement is governed by the clay-water/cement ratio, wc/C. The strength increases with the decrease of wc/C. The increase in salt content for a particular water content decreases the inter-particle attraction of the clay and the cementation bond strength. Hence, for the same clay-water/cement ratio, {{the strength of the}} cement <b>admixed</b> saline clay decreases with increasing salt content. In order to increase strength, and improve the economic and environmental impact, fly ash (FA) and biomass ash (BA) can be used to substitute Portland cement. The influence of FA and BA on the strength development of cement <b>admixed</b> saline clay was investigated with unconfined compressive (UC) test and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. FA and BA were dispersing materials, increasing the reactive surface of the cement grains, and hence strength increases as well.
