40|$|We {{investigate}} charge, valley, <b>and</b> <b>spin</b> transports in normal/ferromagnetic/normal silicene junc- tion. We {{show that}} the charge, valley, <b>and</b> <b>spin</b> conductances in this junction oscillate with {{the length of the}} ferromagnetic silicene. It is also found that the current through this junction is valley <b>and</b> <b>spin</b> polarized due to the coupling between valley <b>and</b> <b>spin</b> degrees of freedom, and the valley <b>and</b> <b>spin</b> polarizations can be tuned by local application of a gate voltage. In particular, we find fully valley <b>and</b> <b>spin</b> polarized current by applying the electric field.

40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} subgap charge <b>and</b> <b>spin</b> {{transport}} in normal-metal/ferromagnet/spin-triplet superconductor (N/F/TS) tunneling junctions induced by bias voltage. Charge <b>and</b> <b>spin</b> conductance are calculated following the extended Blonder–Tinkham–Klapwijk (BTK) theory. We {{show that the}} Andreev reflection, which governs the low-energy transport, may be influenced substantially by the exchange field in the ferromagnet giving rise to controllable giant charge <b>and</b> <b>spin</b> tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. We calculate also the quantum interference effects which lead to oscillatory behavior of charge <b>and</b> <b>spin</b> conductance...|$|R

5|$|The Cruachan station {{temporarily}} stores {{energy at}} times of low demand, and releases it {{at times of}} high demand, when electricity prices are higher, reducing the maximum power that must be provided by power stations.

Despite the use of some rainwater, Cruachan is not a net generator of electricity: it uses more energy for pumping water <b>and</b> <b>spinning</b> its turbines than it generates.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} racing lap, Vettel led by 2.8 seconds from Webber, who was {{followed}} by Alonso, Rosberg, Hamilton, Massa, Button, Schumacher, Kubica, Hülkenberg, Sutil, Barrichello, Kobaysahi, Heidfeld, Alguersari, Liuzzi, Buemi, Glock, Petrov, Kovalainen, Yamamoto, Trulli, Senna and di Grassi. Alonso chose a cautious approach and lost four to five seconds while building up his pace slowly in the early stages. Sutil ran off the circuit but continued after losing his position to both Williams drivers. Webber lost grip on the next lap after running across the outside kerbing <b>and</b> <b>spinning</b> across the track onto the wall between turns twelve and thirteen; he slid back onto the circuit and collected Rosberg, forcing both drivers to retire. The debris on-track from the accident called the safety car to be deployed. Kobayashi, Petrov, Heidfeld and Buemi all made pit stops for intermediate tyres during the safety car period.|$|E
5|$|The 19-year-old Geoff Emerick was {{promoted}} to replace Norman Smith as engineer on the first session for the Revolver album. This started at 8pm on 6 April 1966, in Studio Three at Abbey Road. Lennon told producer Martin {{that he wanted to}} sound like a hundred chanting Tibetan monks, which left Martin the difficult task of trying to find the effect by using the basic equipment they had. The effect was achieved by using a Leslie speaker. When the concept was explained to Lennon, he inquired if the same effect could be achieved by hanging him upside down <b>and</b> <b>spinning</b> him around a microphone while he sang into it. Emerick made a connector to break into the electronic circuitry of the cabinet and then re-recorded the vocal as it came out of the revolving speaker.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} smaller textile {{concerns}} in the parish. Thomas Howarth owned a cottage in Stand Lane from where he sent yarn to be dyed and sized. He made his own warps which were weaved in the town. He would then travel to Preston and Kendal where drapers would purchase his products. His nephews founded A. & J. Hoyle's Mill in Irwell Street, which employed power weaving to produce their specialities in Ginghams and shirting. The mill closed in 1968. Messrs Stott & Pickstone's Top Shop on Stand Lane was the first company to employ powered looms <b>and</b> <b>spinning</b> around 1844. Many of their employees would eventually leave {{to start their own}} businesses, such as Spider Mill, built by Robert and William Fletcher, and John Pickstone. This mill closed around 1930.|$|E

40|$|We study <b>spin</b> <b>and</b> valley {{transports}} in junctions {{composed of}} silicene and topological crystalline insulators. We consider normal/magnetic/normal Dirac metal junctions where a gate electrode {{is attached to}} the magnetic region. In normal/antiferromagnetic/normal silicene junction, we show that the current through this junction is valley <b>and</b> <b>spin</b> polarized due to the coupling between valley <b>and</b> <b>spin</b> degrees of freedom, and the valley <b>and</b> <b>spin</b> polarizations can be tuned by local application of a gate voltage. In particular, we find a fully valley <b>and</b> <b>spin</b> polarized current by applying the electric field. In normal/ferromagnetic/normal topological crystalline insulator junction with a strain induced in the ferromagnetic segment, we investigate valley resolved conductances and clarify how the valley polarization stemming from the strain and exchange field appears in this junction. It is found that changing the direction of the magnetization and the potential in the ferromagnetic region, one can control the dominant valley contribution out of four valley degrees of freedom. We also review spin transport in normal/ferromagnetic/normal graphene junctions, <b>and</b> <b>spin</b> <b>and</b> valley transports in normal/ferromagnetic/normal silicene junctions for comparison.

5|$|During exploration, the Prince navigates areas {{filled with}} traps: these traps include spike pits, arrow traps, {{wall-mounted}} blades and saws, <b>and</b> <b>spinning</b> spiked stakes. The Prince's main contextual move is wall-running, an action where he runs up onto and along a wall {{for a set}} distance, either to land on or jump off to a platform. The Prince's other acrobatic abilities include climbing along and across ledges, walking along beams, swinging on and jumping from poles, jumping onto and between pillars, and swinging on ropes. Large environmental puzzles are encountered during the Prince's journey, extending across multiple areas in large rooms. Many puzzles are cooperative, requiring Farah's help to complete them. In combat, the Prince fights monsters created by the Sands infecting the Palace's inhabitants. A single command contextually triggered different moves depending on position and directional movement, while other special moves such as a somersault attack and bouncing off walls into enemies require additional commands. Enemies can only be killed by stabbing them with the Dagger of Time, which gathers up the Sands inside them.|$|E
5|$|The game, which largely {{follows the}} action RPG and hack and slash {{gameplay}} of previous {{games in the}} series, sees players alternate between the roles of Sora and Riku. Alternating between characters is done via the 'Drop' system. During gameplay, a Drop Gauge gradually depletes over time, though it can be replenished with items. When the gauge completely empties, control will switch to the other character, though players may also opt to drop manually at any time. Drop Points, which are earned by defeating enemies and completing optional objectives, can be spent on bonuses {{that can be used}} until the next time the character drops, such as a slower Drop Gauge or increased attack or defense. The game reuses the Command Deck system from Birth by Sleep, in which players can customize a deck filled with various actions, spells, and items that can be quickly selected. There are also several new elements added to the gameplay. Flowmotion allows players to move quickly about by performing actions such as bouncing off walls, grinding on rails <b>and</b> <b>spinning</b> around poles. Reality Shift is a system the player can use on certain objects or weakened opponents involving a touch-screen activated minigame unique to each world. These include dragging the screen to fling a target like a catapult, touching hidden words to take control of enemies, and playing a small rhythm-based game to cause fireworks to appear.|$|E
5|$|The {{motorcycle}} {{technology of}} the late 1970s featured engines with power in excess of what the frames and tires of the day could accommodate. Roberts' riding style, bred on the dirt tracks of America, revolutionized road racing. Prior to his arrival in Europe, riders focused on attaining high entry speeds into corners, leaving braking until the last possible moment then, carving graceful arcs through the corners with both wheels in line. Roberts did just the opposite, braking early then, quickly applying the throttle {{which resulted in the}} rear tire breaking traction <b>and</b> <b>spinning.</b> The resulting tire spin caused the motorcycle to buck and shake as it continually lost then regained traction, creating a brutal, violent riding style that no one had ever seen before on the racetracks of Europe. His riding style was reminiscent of dirt track riding, where sliding the rear tire to one side is used as a method to steer the motorcycle around a corner. Because of his early application of the throttle, he was able to attain top speed faster than his competitors.|$|E
