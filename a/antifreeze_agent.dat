40|$|There are {{multiple}} applications where chlorinated poly(vinyl chloride) (CPVC) {{may come in}} contact with glycerin. One common application is in fire suppression systems that could be subjected to subfreezing temperatures. Chlorinated poly(vinyl chloride) is increasingly being used for these systems in place of metal because of its many advantages, including the ease of installation, weight reduction, cost benefits and chemical resistance. When CPVC piping is used in an area that has the potential to freeze, an antifreeze solution must be used in the fire suppression systems to suppress the freezing temperature of the water and reduce possibility of failure of the piping system. Glycerin is a commonly used antifreeze for this application. The following article discusses the effects of using glycerin with CPVC piping and presents a case study of the use of bio-derived glycerin as an <b>antifreeze</b> <b>agent.</b> In general, it was found that glycerin from the bio-diesel industry had adverse effects on the CPVC...|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} the potential {{effects of climate}} change on the sub-alpine willow leaf beetle, the cold tolerance strategy and mechanisms involved in cold tolerance were investigated for all life stages. Microhabitat choice and microclimate temperatures within each microhabitat were related to median lethal temperature for each life stage. Summer active and quiescent adults are freeze tolerant, eggs and pupae are freeze avoidant and all larval stages are chill susceptible. Quiescent adults accumulated the highest concentration of glycerol (~ 24 mM) and haemolymph osmolality (875 mOsm). Haemolymph from pupae had angular crystals suggestive of <b>antifreeze</b> <b>agent</b> activity, but this was absent in the haemolymph of other life stages. Quiescent adults must move to a thermally buffered microhabitat in the soil to survive the winter in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. Low temperatures beyond the limits of the cold tolerance of the willow leaf beetle occur often at the mid-willow, but the quiescent adults are protected from these cold exposures in the soil beneath the willow. Overall, the willow leaf beetle uses both behavioural avoidance strategies and physiological mechanisms to survive cold exposures in its habitat...|$|E
40|$|Background: We {{describe}} {{a case of}} acute ethylene glycol poisoning following ingestion of <b>antifreeze</b> <b>agent</b> in which serum ethylene glycol and anion gap were serially measured. Patients: A 66 -year old man was hospitalized after intentional ingestion of automotive antifreeze. Upon admis-sion, vital signs, mental status, and neurological functions were normal. Initial laboratory tests revealed no serum ethanol, normal serum electrolytes, and no osmolal gap, but slightly elevated serum lactate, and a high anion gap. Interventions: The patient {{was admitted to the}} Intensive Care Unit (ICU) 3 hours after ingestion. Intravenous infusion of 10 % ethanol was started without delay and continued for 48 hours. A single course of haemodialysis was performed shortly after admission. After 3 days, the patient was discharged from the hospital on his own request. Measurements and results: Toxicological analysis of blood was positive for ethylene glycol. Gas chroma-tographic measurements of serial serum specimens revealed a maximum ethylene glycol concentration of 1644 mg/l and an exponential decline with a half-life of t 1 / 2 = 31 hours. Conclusion: Ethylene glycol has a slow elimination rate and a long half-life after infusion of ethanol maintaining the blood level between 1. 0 - 1. 5 ‰.

50|$|Thermal {{hysteresis}} {{is easily}} {{measured in the}} lab with a nanolitre osmometer. Organisms differ in their values of thermal hysteresis. The maximum level of thermal hysteresis shown by fish AFP is approximately -1.5 °C (29.3 °F). However, insect antifreeze proteins are 10-30 times more active than fish proteins. This difference probably reflects the lower temperatures encountered by insects on land. In contrast, aquatic organisms are exposed only to -1 to -2 °C below freezing. During the extreme winter months, the spruce budworm resists freezing at temperatures approaching -30 °C.

40|$|AbstractObjective: We {{sought to}} {{investigate}} whether the addition of ethanol to a preservation solution (as an <b>antifreeze</b> <b>agent)</b> might allow a reduction of the storage temperature to 0 °C without causing freezing damage and improve lung function after prolonged (72 hours) ischemia. Methods: Lungs from Sprague-Dawley rats were ventilated and perfused ex vivo at 37 °C for 60 minutes in the following experimental groups: (1) the no ischemia and reperfusion (no I-R) group (n = 7), in which lungs were studied immediately after harvesting; (2) the LPD 24 (n = 7) and (3) LPD 72 (n = 8) groups, in which, after harvesting, lungs were flushed and immersed in low-potassium dextran solution and stored deflated at 10 °C for 24 and 72 hours, respectively, until reperfusion; and (4) the TEST 72 group (n = 9), in which lungs were flushed and immersed in Krebs-Henseleit buffer with added ethanol (10 mL/L) after harvesting and stored deflated at 0 °C for 72 hours until reperfusion. Results: Compared with the no I-R group, the other 3 groups had worse lung function, higher lung water content, and evidence of cell injury at reperfusion (P <. 01). However, lung function at reperfusion (assessed {{on the basis of}} either effluent Po 2, peak airway pressure, or mean arterial pulmonary pressure) was better (P <. 01) in the TEST 72 group than in the LPD 24 or LPD 72 groups. Paradoxically, lung cell structure was better preserved in the LPD 24 group than in the TEST 72 group (or the LPD 72 group). Conclusions: In this experimental model of rat lung ischemia-reperfusion injury, a low preservation temperature (0 °C) combined with the addition of ethanol to the preservation solution improves lung function at reperfusion after 72 hours of ischemia but fails to maintain lung cell structure.

40|$|Glycopeptide and peptide <b>antifreeze</b> <b>agents</b> {{are present}} in the body fluids of polar fishes and allow them to avoid {{freezing}} in ice-laden seawater. These antifreezes lower the freezing point 200 times more than predicted by colligative relations, but have little effect on the melting point of ice.

Such a growth would result in a substantial increase in the roughness of the surface of the crystal.

In a series of sugars increasing in size, glucose, sucrose, raffinose, and α-cyclodextrin, (∂ρ/∂c 2) μ decreases linearly with the solvent density ρ 0. These sugar cosolvents do not interact with the protein; however, the interaction parameter B 1 (g water/g protein) mildly increases with increasing sugar size. The experimental B 1 values are smaller than values calculated by excluded volume (rolling ball) considerations. B 1 relates to hydration in this and in other instances studied.

Here, we report a previously unidentified role for AFPs in effectively inhibiting trehalose precipitation in the hemolymph (or blood) of overwintering beetle larvae. We determine the trehalose level (29. 6 ± 0. 6 mg/mL) in the larval hemolymph of a beetle, Dendroides canadensis, and demonstrate that the hemolymph AFPs are crucial for inhibiting trehalose crystallization, whereas the presence of trehalose also enhances the antifreeze activity of AFPs. To dissect the molecular mechanism, we examine the molecular recognition between AFP and trehalose crystal interfaces using molecular dynamics simulations. The theory corroborates the experiments and shows preferential strong binding of the AFP to the fast growing surfaces of the sugar crystal. This newly uncovered role for AFPs may help explain the long-speculated role of AFPs in freeze-tolerant species. We propose that the presence of high levels of molecules important for survival but prone to precipitation in poikilotherms (their body temperature can vary considerably) needs a companion mechanism to prevent the precipitation and here present, to our knowledge, the first example.

30|$|Glycerol {{acts as a}} top {{building}} block that probably serves as an important biorefinery feedstock [1, 2]. In addition, it is a byproduct from the production of biodiesel from vegetable oils [3]. Conversion of glycerol into valuable chemicals by a green catalytic process is a challenging area of present research. Glycerol is normally generated {{at the rate of}} 1  mol for every 3  mol of methyl esters synthesized [4]. Hydrogenolysis of glycerol is a catalytic chemical reaction that breaks a chemical bond in an organic molecule with the simultaneous addition of a hydrogen atom to the resulting molecular fragments. Through the selective hydrogenolysis of glycerol in the presence of metallic catalysts and hydrogen, 1, 2 -propanediol (1, 2 -PD), 1, 3 -propanediol (1, 3 -PD), and ethylene glycol (EG) could be obtained [5]. Therefore, catalytic hydrogenolysis of glycerol is another alternative route to increase the profitability of biodiesel production plants as the products of glycerol hydrogenolysis can easily replace the chemical compounds, which at present are industrially produced mainly by using non-renewable sources. Propanediol, i.e., 1, 2 -PD, a three-carbon diol with a stereogenic center at the central carbon atom, is an important medium-value commodity chemical with a 4  % annual growth in the market size. It is used for polyester resins, liquid detergents, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, tobacco humectants, flavors and fragrances, personal care, paints, animal feed, antifreeze, etc. [6]. Traditionally, it is produced by the hydration of propylene oxide derived from propylene by either the chlorohydrin process or the hydroperoxide process. There has been a rapid expansion of the market for 1, 2 -PD as an <b>antifreeze</b> and de-icing <b>agent</b> because of the growing concern over the toxicity of ethylene glycol-based products to humans and animals. 1, 3 -PD is also another product obtained during glycerol hydrogenolysis, which is a high-value specialty chemical that is mainly used in specialty polyester fibers, films, and coatings. 1, 3 -PD is copolymerized with terephthalic acid to produce the polyester SORONA 1 from DuPont, or CORTERRA 1 from Shell, which has unique properties in terms of chemical resistance, light stability, elastic recovery, and dyeability [7, 8]. 1, 3 -PD is currently catalytically produced [9]. The production of these chemicals from bio-renewable glycerol can be both environmentally and economically attractive.|$|R
