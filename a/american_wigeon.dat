5|$|Waterfowl, rails, {{and some}} colonial nesting birds are preyed upon by otters in various areas. Susceptibility {{of these species}} is {{greatest}} during the summer (when waterfowl broods are vulnerable) and autumn. The otters have also been known to catch and consume moulting <b>American</b> <b>wigeon</b> (Mareca americana) and green-winged teal (Anas crecca). Other species of birds found within their diets include: northern pintail (Anas acuta); mallard (Anas platyrhynchos); canvasback (Aythya valisineria); ruddy duck (Oxyura jamaicensis); and the American coot (Fulica americana).|$|E

5|$|Over 300 {{species of}} birds have been sighted in the park {{including}} the calliope hummingbird, the smallest bird species in North America, as well as trumpeter swans, which is North America's largest waterfowl. In addition to trumpeter swans, another 30 species of waterfowl have been recorded including blue-winged teal, common merganser, <b>American</b> <b>wigeon</b> and the colorful but reclusive harlequin duck which is occasionally spotted in Cascade Canyon. Both bald and golden eagles and other birds of prey such as the osprey, red-tailed hawk, American kestrel and occasional sightings of peregrine falcon have been reported. Of the 14 species of owls reported, the most common is the great horned owl, though the boreal owl and great grey owl are also seen occasionally. A dozen species of woodpeckers have been reported, as have a similar number of species of warblers, plovers and gulls. The vocal and gregarious black-billed magpie frequents campgrounds while Steller's jay and Clark's nutcracker {{are found in the}} backcountry.

40|$|Burasian Wigeon. On March 10, 1994, I {{discovered}} a male Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope) {{just north of}} the Johnson Waterfowl Production Area in Phelps County. It was in a flock of approximately 200 puddle ducks, but primarily associated with six <b>American</b> <b>Wigeons</b> (Anas americana). The bird was distinctive and easily identified. A modest photograph has been sent to the NOU Records Committee. [...] -Joel Jorgensen, 1218 Jackson St., Blair, NE 68008 Summer Tanager. A Summer Tanager was observed at feeders in Bellevue from Nov. 20 to Dec. 27, 1993 by John Voss (first observer), Grace Hoshall, Bob Rose, and myself. It was a bright field-corn gold all over except for the wings, which were olive-green. The bill was tan, fairly heavy, and blunt-shaped. Fairly tame and rather aggressive, the bird would go from feeder to feeder, scooping up great quantities of seed (Blue Jay style), and keeping other birds out of her territory. She also consumed lots of suet and fresh fruit. [...] -Kathleen Crawford-Rose, 123 Bellevue Blvd. S., Bellevue, NE 6800...|$|R

40|$|Between 25, 000 and 30, 000 playa lakes {{are in the}} playa lakes {{region of}} the {{southern}} high plains (Fig. 1). Most playas are in west Texas (about 20, 000), and fewer, in New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Colorado. The playa lakes region {{is one of the}} most intensively cultivated areas of North America. Dominant crops range from cotton in southern areas to cereal grains in the north. Therefore, most of the native short-grass prairie is gone, replaced by crops and, recently, grasses of the Conservation Reserve Program. Playas are the predominant wetlands and major wildlife habitat of the region. More than 115 bird species, including 20 species of waterfowl, and 10 mammal species have been documented in playas. Waterfowl nest in the area, producing up to 250, 000 ducklings in wetter years. Dominant breeding and nesting species are mallards and blue-winged teals. During the very protracted breeding season, birds hatch from April through August. Several million shorebirds and waterfowl migrate through the area each spring and fall. More than 400, 000 sandhill cranes migrate through and winter in the region, concentrating primarily on the larger saline lakes in the southern portion of the playa lakes region. The primary importance of the playa lakes region to waterfowl is as a wintering area. Wintering waterfowl populations in the playa lakes region range from 1 to 3 million birds, depending on fall precipitation patterns that determine the number of flooded playas. The most common wintering ducks are mallards, northern pintails, green-winged teals, and <b>American</b> <b>wigeons.</b> About 500, 000 Canada geese and 100, 000 lesser snow geese winter in the playa lakes region, and numbers of geese have increased annually since the early 1980 ’s. This chapter describes the physiography and ecology of playa lakes and their attributes that benefit waterfowl...|$|R
5000|$|The Naknek River basin {{is one of}} the {{important}} wildlife habitats of the park.
