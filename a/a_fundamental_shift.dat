5|$|The {{building}} of radial railway lines from 1839 caused <b>a</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>shift</b> away from agricultural supply for London towards large scale house building. Tottenham, Edmonton and Enfield {{in the north}} developed first as working-class residential suburbs with easy access to central London. The line to Windsor through Middlesex was completed in 1848, and the railway to Potters Bar in 1850; and the Metropolitan and District Railways started a series of extensions into the county in 1878. Closer to London, the districts of Acton, Willesden, Ealing and Hornsey came within reach of the tram and bus networks, providing cheap transport to central London.|$|E
5|$|According to Cloud {{and other}} modern {{professional}} historians of Roman history, <b>a</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>shift</b> in {{the punishment of}} murderers may have occurred {{towards the end of}} the third century BCE, possibly spurred on by specific incidents like that of Lucius Hostius' murder of his father, and, more generally, occasioned by the concomitant brutalization of society in the wake of the protracted wars with Hannibal. Previously, murderers would have been handed over to the family of the victim to exact their vengeance, whereas from the second century BCE and onwards, the punishment of murderers became the affair of the Roman state, rather than, that is, that the offended family was given full licence in how to mete out what they deemed to be an appropriate punishment to the murderer of a family member. Within that particular context, Cloud points out, specifically, that certain jokes contained in the plays of the early 2nd century dramatist Plautus may be read to refer to the recent introduction of the punishment by the sack for parricides in particular (without the animals involved).|$|E

Despite the revolutionary nature of the democratic samizdat authors, most democrats advocated moderate strategies for change.

40|$|The impasse of {{development}} {{studies of the}} mid- 1980 s initiated many attempts to construct theories {{of development}} that avoid the perceived economism and functionalism of Marxistinspired development theories (Schuurman 1993). With the exhaustion of the impasse debate, international development studies is confronting yet another challenge: globalization. As the authors of a recent review of international development studies in Canada observe, globalization threatens to create another “impasse ” because “we have an inability {{to decide whether to}} treat it as <b>a</b> <b>fundamental</b> paradigm <b>shift</b> away from development, or to examine it from the perspective of development as just another notion that adds to the complexity of the paradigm itself” (Vainio-Mattila, Inwood, and Parmar 2004 : 162). This paper contributes to this debate by critically evaluating two different perspectives on the relationship between globalization and “development”. Philip McMichael adopts the former perspective, arguing that “globalization ” represents <b>a</b> <b>fundamental</b> paradigm <b>shift</b> away from “development”. Henry Veltmeyer and James Petras, by contrast, argue that “globalization ” is just another phase in a long process of imperialist expansion. The first part of the paper outlines how the authors define the relationship betwee...|$|R

25|$|The term of post bureaucratic {{is used in}} two senses in the {{organizational}} literature: one generic and one much more specific. In the generic sense the term post bureaucratic is often used to describe a range of ideas developed since the 1980s that specifically contrast themselves with Weber's ideal type bureaucracy. This may include total quality management, culture management and matrix management, amongst others. None of these however has left behind the core tenets of Bureaucracy. Hierarchies still exist, authority is still Weber's rational, legal type, and the organization is still rule bound. Heckscher, arguing along these lines, describes them as cleaned up bureaucracies, rather than <b>a</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>shift</b> away from bureaucracy. Gideon Kunda, in his classic study of culture management at 'Tech' argued that 'the essence of bureaucratic control - the formalization, codification and enforcement of rules and regulations - does not change in principle.....it shifts focus from organizational structure to the organization's culture'.|$|E

In the following months, he toured Aboriginal communities and consulted with indigenous leaders, including Charles Perkins and Kath Walker. Despite opposition from state governments, he created a new Office of Aboriginal Affairs within the Prime Minister's Department, as well as a new advisory body called the Council of Aboriginal Affairs (chaired by H.

Despite this, he brought about <b>a</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>shift</b> in the way policy was handled, paving the way {{for the federal government to}} assume many of the powers and responsibilities that had previously been the preserve of the states.

Opposing this, Greg Jenner, historical consultant to [...] Horrible Histories, has stated that while her medical achievements have been exaggerated, removing Seacole from the curriculum would be a mistake. While Peter Hitchens has argued that Seacole's accomplishments have been exaggerated because anybody who put a contrary view was afraid to be accused of racism, both Jenner and Hugh Muir have asserted that this is not the case.

Garcia Ferreira said that the revolutionary government represented one of the few periods in which [...] "state authority was used to promote the interests of the nation's masses." [...] Forster described Árbenz's legacy in the following terms: [...] "In 1952 the Agrarian Reform Law swept the land, destroying forever the hegemony of the planters. Árbenz in effect legislated a new social order... The revolutionary decade... plays a central role in twentieth-century Guatemalan history because it was more comprehensive than any period of reform before or since." [...] She added that even within the Guatemalan government, Árbenz [...] "gave full compass to Indigenous, campesino, and labor demands" [...] in contrast to Arévalo, who had remained suspicious of these movements. Similarly, Greg Grandin stated that the land reform decree [...] "represented <b>a</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>shift</b> in the power relations governing Guatemala". Árbenz himself once remarked that the agrarian reform law was [...] "most precious fruit of the revolution and the fundamental base of the nation as a new country." [...] However, to a large extent the legislative reforms of the Árbenz and Arévalo administrations were reversed by the US-backed military governments that followed.|$|E
