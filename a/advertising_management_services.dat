40|$|An {{objective}} of the article is to analyse the course of processes of <b>advertising</b> activity <b>management</b> at <b>service</b> enterprises operating in the Polish market. Due to the specificity of service activities, there arises the question whether it complies the model concepts being created by theoreticians as there is common {{the assumption that the}} patterns described in the literature are applied mostly at manufactur-ing enterprises, having at their disposal tangible, hence easy to present in advertising massages, prod-ucts. In services, intangible by their nature, there is the need of a certain modification of communica-tion processes, {{and it is difficult to}} decide whether the scale of those modifications equally concerns all the stages of the process of <b>advertising</b> <b>management.</b> Striving to implement the assumed objective, there was carried out an empirical research among representatives of 168 service enterprises operat-ing in Poland. It concerned the determinants, course and evaluation of the process of <b>advertising</b> activity <b>management.</b> In his article, the author presents a synthesis of the most important outcomes of the research together with the conclusions based on it. It must be noted that the processes of ad-vertising activity <b>management</b> at <b>service</b> enterprises go, in principle, in accordance with the concepts presented in the literature, although one may notice some deficiencies in this respect.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{explosive}} growth of Internet has unearthed new business opportunities and created plethora of e-services. However, the ever-increasing number of e-services in the Internet {{makes it difficult}} to advertise and discover them. Moreover, getting e-services to seamlessly interoperate with one another becomes a challenging task. E-speak is Hewlett-Packard's initiative for web based e-services. It is a distributed computing infrastructure for e-commerce that allows eservices to advertise, discover, and interoperate with each other to offer new services in a dynamic, yet secure manner. It provides an XML based open platform for creating, composing, mediating, managing, and accessing Internetbased e-services. The paper overviews the E-speak architecture and its abstractions, such as security, <b>management,</b> <b>advertising</b> <b>service,</b> and event mechanism. We describe the architecture of Web E-speak with its functionality, which embraces XML to interact with the web. In particular we focus on how E-speak supports creation, deployment, and discovery of web based e-services, and how eservices interoperate using E-speak. Index Terms [...] E-speak, e-services, XML, Web I...|$|R
