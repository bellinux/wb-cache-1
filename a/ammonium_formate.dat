Here, we present a fast SFC-MS method for the analysis of medium and high-polarity (− 7 ≤cLogP≤ 2) compounds, designed for implementation in a high-throughput metabonomics setting. Sixty polar analytes were first screened to identify those most suitable for inclusion in chromatographic test mixtures; then, a multi-dimensional method development study was conducted to determine the optimal choice of stationary phase, modifier additive and temperature for the separation of such analytes using SFC. The test mixtures were separated on a total of twelve different column chemistries at three different temperatures, using CO 2 -methanol-based mobile phases containing a variety of polar additives. Chromatographic performance was evaluated with a particular emphasis on peak capacity, overall resolution, peak distribution and repeatability. The results suggest that a new generation of stationary phases, specifically designed for improved robustness in mixed CO 2 -methanol mobile phases, can improve peak shape, peak capacity and resolution for all classes of polar analytes.

Methods: Lithium formate and <b>ammonium</b> <b>formate</b> were chosen as the EPR dosimetric materials and were used to form cylindrical phantoms. The dose distribution of the stable radiation-induced free radicals in the lithium formate and <b>ammonium</b> <b>formate</b> phantoms was assessed by EPRI. EBT films were also inserted inside in <b>ammonium</b> <b>formate</b> phantoms for comparison. MC simulation was performed using the MCNP 4 C 2 software code. Results: The radical signal in irradiated <b>ammonium</b> <b>formate</b> is contained in a single narrow EPR line, with an EPR peak-to-peak linewidth narrower than that of lithium formate (similar to 0. 64 and 1. 4 mT, respectively). The spatial resolution of EPR images was enhanced by a factor of 2. 3 using <b>ammonium</b> <b>formate</b> compared to lithium formate because its linewidth is about 0. 75 mT narrower than that of lithium formate. The EPRI results were consistent to within 1 % with those of Gafchromic EBT films and MC simulations at distances from 1. 0 to 2. 9 mm. The radial dose values obtained by EPRI were about 4 % lower at distances from 2. 9 to 4. 0 mm than those determined by MC simulation and EBT film dosimetry. Conclusions: <b>Ammonium</b> <b>formate</b> is a suitable material under certain conditions for use in brachytherapy dosimetry using EPRI.
