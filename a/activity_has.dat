5|$|Volcanic {{activity}} at Kita-dake ended around 4,900years ago: subsequent eruptions have been centered on Minami-dake. Since 2006 <b>activity</b> <b>has</b> centred on Showa crater, to the East {{of the summit}} of Minami-dake.|$|E
5|$|About 130 {{volcanic}} vents {{belong to}} {{the field and the}} earliest eruptions occurred 1.5 million years ago. Postglacial volcanic <b>activity</b> <b>has</b> included eruptions with simultaneous explosive and effusive components, and volcanic rocks in the field vary from basalt over andesite and dacite to rhyolite. The field was a source of obsidian with regional importance.|$|E
5|$|Activity {{gradually}} declined {{over the}} next two years but stabilized at a higher level than before 1975. The increased level of fumarolic <b>activity</b> <b>has</b> continued at Mount Baker since 1975, but no other changes suggest that magma movement is involved.|$|E

Increased levels of proteasome activity correlate with disease activity and have been implicated in autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
5|$|Eruptive {{activity}} at Mentolat has been ongoing since the Pleistocene, with the earliest explosive eruptions occurring over 17,340 years ago.

5|$|Evidence of Stone Age, Roman, and Anglo-Saxon <b>activity</b> <b>has</b> been {{discovered}} locally. In the Middle Ages, Sale was a rural township, linked ecclesiastically with neighbouring Ashton upon Mersey, whose fields and meadows {{were used for}} crop and cattle farming. By the 17th century, Sale had a cottage industry manufacturing garthweb, the woven material from which horses' saddle girths were made.|$|E

5|$|Five {{overlapping}} craters {{are aligned}} in a north-south line on Lastarria's main cone. Volcanic <b>activity</b> <b>has</b> migrated north during {{the history of}} Lastarria, {{and the most recent}} eruption products are found on the northern and western slopes. A lava dome sits on the northernmost crater rim. The South Spur has two craters.|$|E
5|$|Geothermal {{activity}} and the emission of volcanic gases are ongoing, and the volcano has been prospected {{for the possibility of}} obtaining geothermal energy. The geothermal <b>activity</b> <b>has</b> resulted in widespread rock alteration and the formation of sulfur deposits, which were mentioned in a 1909 report and later mined. Koh-i-Sultan also has deposits of other minerals.|$|E

The monitoring post for Mount Tambora is located at Doro Peti village. They use a seismograph to measure seismic and tectonic activity.

Monitoring is performed continuously inside the caldera, especially around the Doro Api Toi parasitic cone.|$|E

5|$|Volcanism {{as early}} as 14.5million years ago {{has been linked to}} the Anahim hotspot, with the latest {{eruption}} having taken place in the last 8,000years. This volcanic <b>activity</b> <b>has</b> produced rocks that show a bimodal distribution in composition. While these rocks were being deposited, the hotspot coincided with periods of crustal extension and uplift. Activity in modern times has been limited to earthquakes and volcanic gas emissions.|$|E

5|$|Aalborg had a synagogue, {{built in}} 1854; and the Jewish rabbi Salomon Mielziner served it for 35 years. Services {{were no longer}} offered after Mielziner died, and in 1924 the synagogue was donated to the city government, which began using it to store the city {{archives}} (Stadsarkivet). It was burned down by the Schalburg Corps in April 1945 {{towards the end of}} World War II, destroying its centuries-old Torahs. Anti-semitism continues to exist in Denmark, and in 1999, an unlicensed Nazi radio station began operating from a neo-Nazi stronghold in Fynen, Nørresundby, within Aalborg municipality. The <b>activity</b> <b>has</b> been widely denounced with organized opposition in Aalborg and the rest of Denmark, and in February 1999, 12 anti-fascists were arrested for possession of explosives at their base in Fynen.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the {{population}} of Downtown Miami nearly doubled from 2000 to 2010, {{and is expected to}} increase by several thousand more in the current decade, largely due to many new high rise condo developments in the downtown area adding thousands of housing units which will benefit from having the tunnel. Although traffic and port <b>activity</b> <b>has</b> declined since the early 90's, losing some of it to the nearby Port Everglades, which overtook Port of Miami in 2007 as Florida's largest cargo port, the port is likely to see a large shift in the other direction after it becomes one of few deep water ports in the United States able to handle the New Panamax ships by 2016. Within the first month of opening, it was reported that congestion in the downtown area had eased.|$|E
5|$|All {{historical}} eruptions at Kīlauea {{have occurred}} {{at one of}} three places: its summit caldera, its eastern rift zone, or its southwestern rift zone. Half of Kīlauea's historical eruptions have occurred at or near Kīlauea's summit caldera. Activity there was nearly continuous {{for much of the}} 19th century, capped by a massive explosive eruption in 1924 before petering out by 1934. Recent <b>activity</b> <b>has</b> mostly shifted to Kīlauea's eastern rift zone, the site of 24 historical eruptions, located mostly on its upper section; by contrast, the volcano's southwestern rift zone has been relatively quiet, and has only been the site of five events to date.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{metropolitan}} borough of the City of Salford was a 20th-century creation, {{the area has}} a long history of human activity, extending back to the Stone Age. Neolithic flint arrow-heads and tools, and evidence of Bronze Age <b>activity</b> <b>has</b> been discovered in Salford. The Roman road from Manchester (Mamucium) to Bury passes through the city; a hoard of over 550bronze Roman coins dating between 259AD and 278AD was discovered in Boothstown; and a Romano-British bog body, Worsley Man, was discovered in the Chat Moss peat bog.|$|E
5|$|As stated above, the hydrolytic {{proteins}} Rrp6 and Rrp44 {{are associated}} with the exosome in yeast and in humans, besides Rrp6, two different proteins, Dis3 and Dis3L1 can be associated at the position of the yeast Rrp44 protein. Although originally the S1 domain proteins were thought to have 3'-5' hydrolytic exoribonuclease activity as well, the existence of this <b>activity</b> <b>has</b> recently been questioned and these proteins might have just a role in binding substrates prior to their degradation by the complex.|$|E
5|$|Drymoreomys albimaculatus {{appears to}} be a {{specialist}} of dense, moist, montane and premontane forest. It has been found in disturbed and secondary forests as well as in pristine forest, but probably needs contiguous forest to survive. Reproductive <b>activity</b> <b>has</b> been observed in females in June, November, and December and in males in December, suggesting that the species breeds year-round. Although some of its morphological traits, such as the very large pads, are suggestive of arboreal (tree-dwelling) habits, most specimens were collected in pitfall traps on the ground.|$|E
