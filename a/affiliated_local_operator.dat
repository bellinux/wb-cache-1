50|$|Like the {{predecessor}} WB 100+ Station Group, The CW Plus utilizes a dual programming model differing from CW-affiliated stations in large and medium-sized markets. Dayparts on CW Plus affiliates with no CW programming are programmed by the network - primarily featuring programs currently airing in syndication, with syndicated film packages filling select weekend timeslots, and paid programming filling overnight and some early afternoon timeslots; this relieves the <b>local</b> <b>affiliate's</b> <b>operator</b> from {{the duty of}} having to acquire syndicated programming to fill timeslots outside of The CW's network schedule. However, some over-the-air CW Plus affiliates may fill paid programming time with content from another subchannel network such as MeTV, This TV or Antenna TV, particularly if the network whose content is sourced {{does not have an}} existing full-time affiliate in the market. The operator of the CW Plus <b>affiliate</b> handles <b>local</b> advertising sales for the station, cable-only outlet or subchannel, which incorporates local commercial inserts during CW network and syndicated programming supplied by the service.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{investigation}} of wavefront sets of n-point distributions in {{quantum field theory}} has recently acquired some attention stimulated by results obtained {{with the help of}} concepts from microlocal analysis in quantum field theory in curved spacetime. In the present paper, the notion of wavefront set of a distribution is generalized so as to be applicable to states and linear functionals on nets of operator algebras carrying a covariant action of the translation group in arbitrary dimension. In the case where one is given a quantum field theory in the operator algebraic framework, this generalized notion of wavefront set, called “asymptotic correlation spectrum”, is further investigated and several of its properties for physical states are derived. We also investigate the connection between the asymptotic correlation spectrum of a physical state and the wavefront sets of the corresponding Wightman distributions if there is a Wightman field <b>affiliated</b> to the <b>local</b> <b>operator</b> algebras. Finally we present a new result (generalizing known facts) which shows that certain spacetime points must be contained in the singular supports of the 2 n-point distributions of a non-trivial Wightman field. ...|$|R

50|$|The WB 100+ Station Group {{utilized}} a {{dual programming}} model which {{differed from the}} traditional network affiliate model used by WB-affiliated stations in large and medium-sized markets, in which the affiliate handled complete responsibility of providing syndicated and local programming to fill non-network timeslots. Instead, dayparts on WB 100+ affiliates without WB programming were programmed by the network, primarily with programs that were being carried {{at the time in}} national syndication - along with syndicated film packages that filled select weekend timeslots, and brokered programming (such as infomercials and religious programs) that was time-leased by The WB to fill most overnight and some early afternoon timeslots on the service; this relieved the WB 100+ <b>affiliate's</b> <b>local</b> owner of the duty of acquiring syndicated programming to fill timeslots not occupied by network content from The WB.

First we treat Van Oosten's result that <b>local</b> <b>operators</b> on the effective topos are internally NNO-indexed joins of what we shall call 'basic' <b>local</b> <b>operators.</b> Our main innovation is the notion of a tree-like structure called 'sight', which provides a tangible representation of <b>local</b> <b>operators</b> on the effective topos.

We introduced the (Renyi) entanglement entropies of given <b>local</b> <b>operators</b> which measure the degrees of freedom of <b>local</b> <b>operators</b> and characterize them in conformal field theories {{from the viewpoint of}} quantum entanglement. In present paper, we explain how to compute them in free massless scalar field theories and we also investigate their time evolution. The results are interpreted in terms of relativistic propagation of an entangled pair. The main new results which we acquire in the present paper are as follows. Firstly, we provide an explanation which shows that the (Renyi) entanglement entropies of a specific operator are given by (Renyi) entanglement entropies of binomial distribution by the replica method. That operator is constructed of only scalar field. Secondly, we found the sum rule which (Renyi) entanglement entropies of those <b>local</b> <b>operators</b> obey. Those <b>local</b> <b>operators</b> are located separately. Moreover we argue that (Renyi) entanglement entropies of specific operators in conformal field theories are given by (Renyi) entanglement entropies of binomial distribution. These specific operators are constructed of single-species operator. We also argue that general operators obey the sum rule which we mentioned above.
