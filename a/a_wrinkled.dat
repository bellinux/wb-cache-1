5|$|Teratological (developmentally abnormal) {{forms of}} H.aurantiaca were {{reported}} {{to occur in the}} United Kingdom. The fruit bodies of these specimens were club-shaped with <b>a</b> <b>wrinkled</b> upper surface of convoluted gill tissue. The overall morphology of these forms somewhat resembles species of Clavariadelphus. Although the cause of this abnormal development is not known with certainty, environmental pollutants or virus infection have been suggested as contributing factors.|$|E
5|$|Gyromitra esculenta has <b>a</b> <b>wrinkled</b> surface (similar to brainlike convolutions), not wavy or bumpy like G.infula. Gyromitra ambigua is {{very similar}} in appearance, and {{although}} it is usually not possible to discern between the two species without examining microscopic characteristics, G.ambigua {{is said to have}} more pronounced purple tints in the stipe. G.ambigua has larger spores that are about 22–30µm long. The saddle-shaped cap of G.infula might also lead to confusion with some species of Helvella, but these latter fungi typically have grayer colors and thinner, fluted stipes.|$|E
5|$|Géricault {{painted with}} small brushes and viscous oils, which allowed {{little time for}} {{reworking}} and were dry by the next morning. He kept his colours apart from each other: his palette consisted of vermilion, white, naples yellow, two different yellow ochres, two red ochres, raw sienna, light red, burnt sienna, crimson lake, Prussian blue, peach black, ivory black, cassel earth and bitumen. Bitumen has a velvety, lustrous appearance when first painted, but {{over a period of}} time discolours to a black treacle, while contracting and thus creating <b>a</b> <b>wrinkled</b> surface, which cannot be renovated. As a result of this, details in large areas of the work can hardly be discerned today.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the story, {{the main}} {{character}} Miranda is often reading Madeleine L'Engle's <b>A</b> <b>Wrinkle</b> in Time, Stead's favorite book as a child; she read and reread it multiple times. She recalls that L'Engle was the only author she met in her childhood. Stead described the novel as a talisman for Miranda; she included {{it in the first}} draft and planned to remove it, [...] "because you can't just toss <b>A</b> <b>Wrinkle</b> in Time in there casually". Her editor suggested leaving it in if it could be better tied into the story. Stead was aware that she did not want <b>A</b> <b>Wrinkle</b> in Time to have too big an influence on When You Reach Me.

She holds a spear and a skull-cup (kapala) in her two hands. The spear is sometimes replaced by a sword. Another description in the same text says Dhumavati is aged with <b>a</b> <b>wrinkled,</b> angry face and cloud-like complexion. Her nose, eyes, and throat resemble a crow's. She holds a broom, a winnowing fan, a torch, and a club. She is cruel and frowning. Her hair appears dishevelled and she wears the simple clothes of a beggar. Her breasts are dry. Her hair is grey, her teeth crooked and missing, and her clothes old and worn.|$|E
5|$|Russula emetica {{is one of}} over 100 red-capped Russula species known worldwide. The related {{beechwood}} sickener (R.nobilis) {{is found}} under beech in Europe. Many, such as the bloody brittlegill (R.sanguinaria), are inedible; this species can be distinguished from R.emetica by the reddish flush in its stem. R.aurea, however, is edible. It has a yellow stem, gills and flesh under its red cap. The edible R.rugulosa—common in mixed woods in the eastern and northern United States—has <b>a</b> <b>wrinkled</b> and pimpled cap cuticle, cream spores, and mild taste. Another inedible species, R.fragilis, has notched gills, and its stem stains blue with naphthol. The uncommon European subspecies R.emetica longipes is distinguished by its longer stem and ochre gills. The paler European mushroom R.betularum, found in coniferous forests and moorland, is sometimes considered a subspecies of R.emetica. R.nana is restricted in distribution to arctic and subarctic highland meadows where dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) or alpine bearberry (Arctostaphylos alpina) are abundant.|$|E

500|$|L.crocipodium is a {{lookalike}} that {{is difficult}} to distinguish from L.rugosiceps. It generally has a darker cap, paler scabers, and somewhat wider spores, although these characteristics are variable. L.nigrescens is also similar to L.rugosiceps, but has a darker brownish cap and stipe, flesh that slowly stains with injury (reddish, pinkish gray, or purplish black). It is usually found in sandy soil. Another Leccinum species that associates with oak is L.carpini, which also has <b>a</b> <b>wrinkled</b> cap. Unlike L.rugosiceps, its flesh stains pink to reddish. In his original species description, Charles Peck noted that L.rugosiceps [...] grew with L.rubropunctum, [...] "from which it is easily separated by its dry pileus, smaller tubes and stouter stem." ...|$|E
500|$|The CT scan in 2006, led by Alexander Huppertz, the {{director}} of the Imaging Science Institute in Berlin, revealed <b>a</b> <b>wrinkled</b> face of Nefertiti carved in the inner core of the bust. The results were published in the April 2009 Radiology journal. The scan revealed that Thutmose placed layers of varying thickness on top of the limestone core. The inner face has creases around her mouth and cheeks and a swelling on the nose. The creases and the bump on the nose are leveled by the outermost stucco layer. According to Huppertz, this may reflect [...] "aesthetic ideals of the era". The 2006 scan provided greater detail than the 1992 one, revealing subtle details just 1–2mm under the stucco.|$|E

500|$|His {{image as}} the wise, old doctor is {{reinforced}} by busts of him, which wear large beards on <b>a</b> <b>wrinkled</b> face. Many physicians of the time wore their hair {{in the style of}} Jove and Asklepius. Accordingly, the busts of Hippocrates that have been found could be only altered versions of portraits of these deities. Hippocrates and the beliefs that he embodied are considered medical ideals. Fielding Garrison, an authority on medical history, stated, [...] "He is, above all, the exemplar of that flexible, critical, well-poised attitude of mind, ever on the lookout for sources of error, which is the very essence of the scientific spirit." [...] "His figure... stands for all time as that of the ideal physician," [...] according to A Short History of Medicine, inspiring the medical profession since his death.|$|E
500|$|The skull, {{measuring}} [...] in length, was proportionally {{shorter and}} deeper {{than in any}} other large carnivorous dinosaur. The snout was moderately broad, not as tapering as seen in more basal theropods like Ceratosaurus, and the jaws were curved upwards. As in other abelisaurids, the facial bones, especially the nasal bones, were sculptured with numerous small holes and spikes. In life, <b>a</b> <b>wrinkled</b> and possibly keratinous skin would have covered these bones. A prominent pair of horns protruded obliquely above the eyes. These horns, formed by the frontal bones, were thick, cone-shaped but in cross-section somewhat vertically flattened, and measured [...] in length. In life, they would probably have formed the bony cores of much longer keratinous horns. The proportionally small eyes were situated in {{the upper part of the}} keyhole shaped orbita (eye sockets). The upper part was slightly rotated forward, probably permitting some degree of binocular vision.|$|E

2500|$|Mitochondria hyperpolarization is a {{key event}} in {{initiating}} changes in morphology. Intraplatelet calcium concentration increases, stimulating the interplay between microtubule/actin filament complex. The continuous changes in shape from the unactivated to the fully activated platelet is best seen on scanning electron microscopy. Three steps along this path are named early dendritic, early spread and spread. The surface of the unactivated platelet looks {{very similar to the}} surface of the brain, with <b>a</b> <b>wrinkled</b> appearance from numerous shallow folds to increase the surface area; early dendritic, an octopus with multiple arms and legs; early spread, an uncooked frying egg in a pan, the [...] "yolk" [...] being the central body; and the spread, a cooked fried egg with a denser central body. These changes are all brought about by the interaction of the microtubule/actin complex with the platelet cell membrane and open canalicular system (OCS), which is an extension and invagination of that membrane. This complex runs just beneath these membranes, and is the chemical motor which literally pulls the invaginated OCS out of the interior of the platelet like turning pants pockets inside out, creating the dendrites. and then spreads each dendrite until the entire OCS becomes indistinguishable from the initial platelet membrane as it forms the [...] "fried egg". This dramatic increase in surface area comes about with neither stretching nor adding phospholipids to the platelet membrane.|$|E
