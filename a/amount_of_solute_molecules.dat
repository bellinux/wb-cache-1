The cross-cut block of hinoki, PEG 1540, and water was employed as wood sample, solute, and solvent, respectively. The wood sample impregnated with a 20 mass% solution was conditioned at 20, 35, or 50  °C until the dimension of the sample became almost constant. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> diffused <b>solute</b> during conditioning was evaluated using the dimension of the sample that was conditioned followed by drying in a vacuum. To unify the solute-concentration difference, for all temperatures, the equilibrium MC was unified and the evaporation-rate constant was controlled in three ways during conditioning. The solute diffusivity was evaluated using the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> the diffused <b>solute</b> at the same evaporation-rate constant. The diffusivity was higher in order of 35, 50, and 20  °C. It is clarified that the diffusivity increases with increasing the dimension of cell walls rather than with increasing the thermal vibration <b>of</b> <b>solute</b> <b>molecule.</b>|$|R
50|$|Solvophobic theory {{attempts}} to explain interactions between polar solvents and non-polar solutes. In the pure solvent, there are relatively strong cohesive forces between the solvent molecules due to hydrogen bonding or other polar interactions. Hence, non-polar solutes {{tend not to}} be soluble in polar solvents because these solvent-solvent binding interactions must be overcome first. When applied to liquid chromatography (LC), solvophobic theory attributes the retention <b>of</b> <b>solutes</b> on the stationary phase partly to the rejection <b>of</b> <b>solute</b> <b>molecules</b> by the solvent, and partly to the attraction <b>of</b> the <b>solute</b> <b>molecules</b> by the stationary phase.|$|R

The structures, dynamics and hydration free energies <b>of</b> the <b>solute</b> <b>molecules</b> in water have been analysed. Radial distribution functions, spatial density distribution functions and hydrogen bond analyses are employed to characterize the solvation shells of water around the central <b>solute</b> <b>molecules.</b> We have found that water molecules form two solvation shells around the central <b>solute</b> <b>molecule.</b> Hydrogen bonding in the bulk solvent is unaffected by increasing n. The large decrease in solvation enthalpies <b>of</b> these <b>solute</b> <b>molecules</b> for n > 14 enhances solubilisation. The diffusion constants <b>of</b> <b>solute</b> <b>molecules</b> decrease with increasing n. The solvation free energy of C- 60 in water is positive (52. 8 kJ/mol), whereas its value for C- 60 (OH) (30) is highly negative (- 427. 1 kJ/mol).

The nanoscale confinement also leads to a significant increase of the critical aggregation concentration (CAC). A theoretical model based on Gibbs free energy calculation is developed to describe the simulation results.

A similar result has been obtained in case of photoisomerization studies carried out with a carbocyanine derivative in the sol and gel phases of the block copolymer. The isomerization studies have been extended to the reverse phases (sol and gel phases) of the block copolymer to explore the nature of the water present in the cores of the reverse micelles. Our results provide evidence for the existence of water droplets with properties resembling bulk water.
