5|$|By the 1860s, natural ice was {{increasingly}} {{being used to}} move western <b>American</b> <b>products</b> to the east, starting with chilled meat from Chicago. There was some initial opposition, both from the cattle-car owners and from eastern butchers, who stood to lose out from the trade; by the 1870s, however, multiple shipments were leaving for the east each day. Chilled butter from the mid-West was then shipped onwards from New York to Europe, and by the 1870s 15 percent of the United Kingdom's butter consumption was being met in this way. A chain of icing stations at Chicago, Omaha, Utah and Sierra Nevada allowed railroad refrigerator cars to cross the continent. The ability of ice companies to ship their product by rail from the east proved the final straw for the Alaskan ice trade, which collapsed during the 1870s and 1880s {{in the face of}} the competition, destroying the local saw-mill industry in the process.|$|E

25|$|Heinze's first book, Adapting to Abundance: Jewish Immigrants, Mass Consumption, and the Search for American Identity, was {{published}} in 1990. It was the first full-length study {{of the impact of}} American consumer culture on an immigrant group. Hasia Diner, Professor of History at New York University, said about Heinze: “Historians of immigration and Jewish history will be indebted to him for opening up whole areas of behavior which they previously shrugged off as irrelevant.” The Journal of Consumer Affairs remarked upon the variety of topics that the book explored: the rise of ad campaigns for major <b>American</b> <b>products</b> in the foreign-language press; the rise of the summer vacation among working people; installment-buying as a way for working families to obtain expensive furnishings such as pianos; the role of Jewish women as agents of assimilation through their control over family purchases; and the way that American abundance altered religious rituals, especially holidays such as Chanukah and Passover. Adapting to Abundance established Heinze's reputation as part of a scholarly vanguard that produced the first histories of mass consumption in Europe and America. It is widely referenced in books, articles and syllabi around the world.|$|E
25|$|Rates {{of obesity}} {{and heart disease}} in France have {{traditionally}} been lower than in other north-western European countries. This is sometimes called the French paradox (see, for example, Mireille Guiliano's 2006 book French Women Don't Get Fat). French cuisine and eating habits have however come under great pressure in recent years from modern fast food, such as <b>American</b> <b>products</b> and the new global agricultural industry. While French youth culture has gravitated toward fast food and American eating habits (with an attendant rise in obesity), the French in general have remained committed to preserving certain elements of their food culture through such activities as including programs of taste acquisition in their public schools, {{by the use of}} the appellation d'origine contrôlée laws, and by state and European subsidies to the French agricultural industry. Emblematic of these tensions is the work of José Bové, who founded in 1987, the Confédération Paysanne, an agricultural union that places its highest political values on humans and the environment, promotes organic farming and opposes genetically modified organisms; Bové's most famous protest was the dismantling of a McDonald's franchise in Millau (Aveyron), in 1999.|$|E

500|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, American {{companies}} were producing simple home computer kits {{such as the}} MITS Altair and IMSAI 8080. This aroused interest among electronics hobbyists in the UK but relatively high prices and lower disposable income reduced {{the appeal of the}} <b>American</b> <b>products.</b> New Scientist stated in 1977 that [...] "the price of an American kit in dollars rapidly translates into the same figure in pounds sterling by the time it has reached the shores of Britain". Off-the-shelf personal computers were also available for {{the high end of the}} market but were extremely expensive; Olivetti's offering cost £2,000, and the Commodore PET, launched in 1979, sold for £700. There was nothing for the hobbyist at the low end of the market. Sinclair realised that this provided a useful commercial opportunity.|$|E

[...] In 1959, the American National Exhibition was held on Sokolniki Park in Moscow. [...] The exhibition was opened by Vice President Richard Nixon and attended by Walt Disney, Buckminster Fuller, William Randolph Hearst, and senior executives from Pepsi, Kodak and Macy's. [...] It featured American consumer goods, cars, boats, RCA color TVs, food, clothing, etc., and samples of <b>American</b> <b>products</b> such as Pepsi. [...] There was a typical American kitchen set up inside in which spectators could watch a Bird's Eye frozen meal be prepared. [...] An IBM RAMAC computer was programmed to answer 3,500 questions about America in Russian. [...] The most popular question was [...] "what {{is the meaning of}} the American Dream?" [...] The Soviets tried to limit the audience by only giving tickets to party members and setting up their own rival exhibition. [...] But ultimately people came, and the souvenir pins that were given out turned up in every corner of the country. [...] The Soviets banned printed material, but the Americans gave it out anyway. [...] The most popular items were the Bible and a Sears catalogue. [...] The guides for the exhibition were American graduate students, including African Americans and women, who spoke Russian. [...] This gave Russians the ability to speak to real Americans and ask difficult questions. [...] The ambassador to Moscow, Llewellyn Thompson, commented that [...] "the exhibition would be 'worth more to us than five new battleships." [...] Exhibitions like this were used to display the best a culture had to offer and basically show off in a way that appeared non threatening and even friendly.|$|E
60|$|We {{may well}} be on our guard against a vaunting nationalism. It retards our culture. There should be no {{confusion}} of the second-rate values of most of our <b>American</b> <b>products</b> with the supreme values of the greatest British classics. We may work, of course, toward an ultimate appreciation of these greatest things. We fail, however, in securing such appreciation because we have failed to enlist those forms of interest which vitalize and stimulate literary studies--above all, the patriotic or national interest. Concord and Cambridge should be dearer, as they are nearer, to the young American than even Stratford and Abbotsford; Hawthorne should be as familiar as Goldsmith; and Emerson, as Addison or Burke. Ordinarily it is not so; and we suffer the consequences in the failure of our youth to grasp the spiritual ideals and the distinctively American democratic spirit which find expression in the greatest work of our literary masters, Emerson and Whitman, Lowell and Lanier. Our culture and our nationalism both suffer thereby. Our literature suffers also, because we have not an instructed and interested public to encourage excellence.|$|E
