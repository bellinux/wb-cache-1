50|$|The pitcher fluid of N. flava {{is highly}} viscous and coats the inner pitcher walls. This is {{especially}} true of <b>aerial</b> <b>traps,</b> which must contend with the action of the wind.

It has been suggested that the pitchers of this species function not only as pitfall traps but also as flypaper traps. Indeed, this trapping method is employed by the closely related N. inermis, which also produces highly viscous pitcher fluid.|$|R

In addition, N. hamiguitanensis inhabits a different ecological niche to either of these species; it typically grows in partial shade under the cover of mountain forest or at forest margins, whereas N. micramphora and N. peltata are commonly found in more exposed sites.|$|R
25|$|In <b>aerial</b> <b>traps,</b> {{the pitcher}} cup is {{predominantly}} yellowish-green with a darker, orange to red peristome. In certain specimens the upper pitchers may be faintly red speckled. Beyond this common pigmentation, both lower and upper pitchers exhibit {{a continuum of}} colours across the species, from wholly yellowish-green at one extreme to entirely burgundy at the other. The latter colour form is particularly striking and is far more frequently encountered in N.leonardoi {{than in any other}} closely allied Philippine Nepenthes. In extreme cases, the upper pitchers may look almost completely black. Flash photography shows the actual colour of the pitcher cup to be a uniform deep purple; their very dark appearance seems to result from a combination of this purple pigmentation and their brown indumentum. This effect is particularly pronounced in wet pitchers.|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} {{contribution of}} palm plantations to {{the conservation of}} forest-dwelling Cetoniinae (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae) is assessed in southern Benin. Sample plots of 10 <b>aerial</b> <b>traps</b> per habitat type were set in two sites containing a forest patch, a palm plantation and some agricultural land. Overall, 2, 217 individuals belonging to 31 species were collected. Typical species of each habitat were identified with the IndVal method (Dufrne and Legendre 1997). Species were categorized into three habitat-groups: forest specialists (11 species), farmland and open habitat specialists (9 species) and ubiquitous, generalist species found in all habitats (5 species). Only six species were too rare for assessing habitat preference. Palm plantations host a low density of Cetoniinae with no unique species. However, species composition reveals that they are used by forest specialist species that avoid open habitats like farmlands, therefore providing structural connectivity. Cetoniine flower beetles have potential as an indicator group, {{which can be used}} in multi-taxa approaches for habitat assessments in Africa. Using species-level metrics, their response to habitat change is clear, including the response of common species.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{colonization}} by phytoseiid mites living in neighboring uncultivated areas of a vineyard in the South of France. The experimental vine plot was co-planted with Sorbus domestica in a framework of agroforestery investigations. This study was carried out during 3 years (1999, 2000 and 2001) in a vine plot planted in 1997. Phytoseiid mites have been collected in cultivated and uncultivated areas surrounding the experimental plot.

40|$|<b>Aerial</b> <b>traps,</b> using {{combinations}} {{of color and}} attractive lures, are a critical tool for detecting and managing insect pest populations. Yet, despite improvements in trap efficacy, collection of nontarget species (“bycatch”) plagues many insect pest surveys. Bycatch can influence survey effectiveness by reducing the available space for target species and increasing trap screening time, especially in areas where thousands of insects are captured as bycatch in a given season. Additionally, bycatch may negatively impact local nontarget insect populations, including beneficial predators and pollinators. Here, we tested the effect of pheromone lures on bycatch rates of Coccinellidae (Coleoptera), Apoidea (Hymenoptera), and nontarget Lepidoptera. Multicolored (primarily yellow and white) bucket traps containing a pheromone lure for capturing one of three survey target species, Spodoptera litura (F.), S. littoralis (Boisduval), or Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner), were placed in alfalfa and corn fields, and compared to multicolored traps without a pheromone lure. All-green traps with and without H. armigera lures were employed in a parallel study investigating the effect of lure and trap color on bycatch. Over 2, 600 Coccinellidae representing seven species, nearly 6, 400 bees in 57 species, and 3 ̆e 9, 000 nontarget moths in 17 genera were captured across 180 traps and seven temporal sampling events.

40|$|Effects of {{temperature}} and precipitation on the temporal patterns of dispersing tobacco thrips, Frankliniella fusca, and onion thrips, Thrips tabaci, caught on yellow sticky traps were estimated {{in central and}} eastern North Carolina and eastern Virginia from 1997 through 2001. The impact that these environmental factors had on numbers of F. fusca and T. tabaci caught on sticky traps during April and May was determined using stepwise regression analysis of 43 and 38 site-years of <b>aerial</b> <b>trapping</b> data from 21 and 18 different field locations, respectively. The independent variables used in the regression models included degree-days, total precipitation, and the number of days in which precipitation occurred during January through May. Each variable was significant in explaining variation for both thrips species and, in all models, degree-days was the single best explanatory variable. Precipitation had a comparatively greater effect on T. tabaci than F. fusca. The numbers of F. fusca and T. tabaci captured in flight were positively related to degree-days and the number of days with precipitation but negatively related to total precipitation. Combined in a single model, degree-days, total precipitation, and the number of days with precipitation explained 70 and 55 % of the total variation in the number of F. fusca captured from 1 April through 10 May and from 1 April through 31 May, respectively.

40|$|Comparing pollen influx {{recorded}} in traps {{above the surface}} and {{below the surface of}} Lake Baiyangdian in northern China shows that the average pollen influx in the traps above the surface is much lower, at 1210 grains cm− 2 a− 1 (varying from 550 to 2770 grains cm− 2 a− 1), than in the traps below the surface which average 8990 grains cm− 2 a− 1 (ranging from 430 to 22310 grains cm− 2 a− 1). This suggests that about 12 % of the total pollen influx is transported by air, and 88 % via inflowing water. If hydrophyte pollen types are not included, the mean pollen influx in the traps above the surface decreases to 470 grains cm− 2 a− 1 (varying from 170 to 910 grains cm− 2 a− 1) and to 5470 grains cm− 2 a− 1 in the traps below the surface (ranging from 270 to 12820 grains cm− 2 a− 1), suggesting that the contribution of waterborne pollen to the non-hydrophyte pollen assemblages in Lake Baiyangdian is about 92 %. When trap assemblages are compared with sediment–water interface samples from the same location, the differences between pollen assemblages collected using different methods are more significant than differences between assemblages collected at different sample sites in the lake using the same trapping methods. We compare the ratios of terrestrial pollen and aquicolous pollen types (T/A) between traps in the water and <b>aerial</b> <b>traps,</b> and examine pollen assemblages to determine whether proportions of long-distance taxa (i. e. those known to only grow beyond the estimated aerial source radius); these data suggest that the pollen source area of this lake is composed of three parts, an aerial component mainly carried by wind, a fluvial catchment component transported by rivers and another waterborne component transported by surface wash.
