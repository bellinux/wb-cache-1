During summer {{vacation}} when Hoffman was 10 years old, he joined Glenn while he was playing in Pawtucket. His oldest brother, Greg, was 14 years Hoffman's senior and a mentor to his two younger brothers. [...] After Hoffman's first Little League game, Greg {{asked him how he}} did. Hoffman responded, [...] "I went 2-for-4, double, RBI." [...] to which Greg replied, [...] "That'll be the last (blanking) time you tell me how you did.

[...] " [...] was the guide while Greg was the drill instructor", said Hoffman.|$|E
2500|$|Chomsky {{has been}} a {{consistent}} and outspoken critic of the United States government, and criticism of the foreign policy of the United States has {{formed the basis of}} much of his political writing. Chomsky gives reasons for directing his activist efforts to the state of which he is a citizen. He believes that his work can have more impact when directed at his own government, and that he holds a responsibility {{as a member of a}} particular country of origin to work to stop that country from committing crimes. He expresses this idea often with a comparison of other countries holding that every country has flexibility to address crimes by unfavored countries, but is always unwilling to deal with their own. Speaking [...] in Nicaragua in 1986, Chomsky was asked [...] "We feel that through what you say and write you are our friend but at the same time you talk about North American imperialism and Russian imperialism in the same breath. I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> you can use the same arguments as reactionaries?" [...] to which Chomsky responded, ...|$|E

6000|$|I made a {{careless}} and inconsequential answer, for I supposed he was joking. But {{he assured me}} that he was in earnest. He said: [...] "I'm not discussing the question of whether you stole it or didn't--for that is a question that can be settled in the first bookstore we come to--I am only <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> came to steal it, for that is where my curiosity is focalized." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If {{you want}} to see it in the right light, you can think you've let it run on till after you're out of college, and then you've got to tell her.

6000|$|... "I {{think she}} is certain to do {{anything}} <b>you</b> <b>ask.</b> <b>You</b> saw <b>how</b> friendly she was to you at lunch. I don't see how anything can have happened since lunch to change her." ...|$|R
