The scope of the first <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> was on buildings and building solutions. Research within this field of knowledge is already well established. But very recently, there has been a progressive development of tools aiming at broader scales such as neighborhoods, urban districts and larger urban areas. These <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> borrowed strategies that were used in their predecessors (aiming at the building scale) that bring some problems when assessing sustainability in urban areas. In this article, several sustainability <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> for urban areas were analyzed in several criteria. The analysis showed that all existing <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> share some issues regardless of having different approaches.

Likewise the hypothesis is, that as infants go through states of cognitive development, people with AD go through the reverse process of progressive cognitive impairment.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pain {{continues}} to be a significant problem for older adults worldwide and a challenge for health care clinicians and researchers in assuring accurate identification and tailored treatment approaches. Attention has been devoted in recent years to development of pain <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> that are reliable and valid for use with older adults, including self-report scales and pain observation tools. METHODS AND DESIGN: This integrative review examines face, content, and construct validity relative to the research development, linguistic translation, and clinical implementation of self-report pain <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> in culturally diverse older adults. RESULTS: Many self-report pain <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> have not been tested and validated in many older adults of diverse cultures. As a result, self-report tools are limited in their accuracy and ability to capture the cultural distinctions that impact pain intensity ratings. CONCLUSION: The multiculturalism of health care and the use of existing pain <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> globally require that clinicians and researchers consider tool validity that incorporates the individual 2 ̆ 7 s cultural system in order to provide quality pain assessment. This article addresses one aspect of tool development and application across populations, the validation of self-report pain <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> for culturally diverse older adults.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine K- 12 music {{educators}} 2 ̆ 7 attitudes regarding the use of technology in the assessment of music learning. There is a considerable range of musical behaviors with different levels of complexity that can be assessed (Boyle 2 ̆ 6 Radocy, 1987). A variety of software and web-based <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> are available for music educators. However, it is unclear how many teachers are taking advantage of incorporating these technological <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> into their instructional practice. This study provided current data about the demographics of teachers using technology to assess musical growth and the variables that might motivate a music teacher to use technology-assisted <b>assessment</b> <b>tools.</b> A researcher-designed survey was administered to a stratified, random sample of K- 12 music educators. A sample of 2, 211 music educators, provided by MENC: The National Association of Music Education, was surveyed. The survey questions determined the number of teachers using technology-assisted <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> and the types of <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> they use. The mean score from a series of belief statements suggested teachers 2 ̆ 7 attitudes towards assessment practices and technology was positive. However, it was discovered that specific school and teacher factors had a generally small influence on their perceptions of technology-assisted <b>assessment</b> <b>tools.</b> It was evident that music teachers are utilizing technology for daily instruction more often than to assist with assessment strategies. The factors of time and resources are two important variables that affect teachers 2 ̆ 7 decisions regarding the use of technology for assessment in music settings, and future studies are needed to investigate effective professional development opportunities in training teachers to incorporate technology-assisted <b>assessment</b> <b>tools</b> with music instruction. ...|$|R
