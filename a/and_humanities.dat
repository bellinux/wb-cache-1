5|$|As with {{cultural}} studies, media {{study is a}} distinct discipline that owes to the convergence of sociology and other social sciences <b>and</b> <b>humanities,</b> in particular, literary criticism and critical theory. Though the production process or the critique of aesthetic forms {{is not in the}} remit of sociologists, analyses of socializing factors, such as ideological effects and audience reception, stem from sociological theory and method. Thus the 'sociology of the media' is not a subdiscipline per se, but the media is a common and often-indispensable topic.|$|E

40|$|This article {{attempts}} {{to investigate the}} characteristics of research evaluations for social science <b>and</b> <b>humanity</b> researchers. A successful research evaluation should include all the publication media used by their researchers. In social science <b>and</b> <b>humanity</b> studies, articles <b>and</b> books {{are the two most}} commonly used scientific publication media, but several other publication media {{play an important role in}} some disciplines too. In additions, books always receive high citation rate. Also, social science <b>and</b> <b>humanity</b> researches deal with local and regional problems more often and cite earlier articles than are in sciences. Thus, any evaluation that covered only articles or books would probably be incomplete to varying degrees. A window of longer years for evaluation would be more appropriate for social science <b>and</b> <b>humanity</b> researchers. [Article Content in Chinese...|$|R
