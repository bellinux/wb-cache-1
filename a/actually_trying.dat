However, this marriage was far from typical of the Elves.|$|E
5|$|Worried by the events, the {{hospital}} coordinator, Dr. Theresa Shannon, tells Mulder and Scully about a similar series of deaths that {{occurred at the}} same hospital ten years prior. They suspect Rebecca Waite (O-Lan Jones), a nurse who {{is the only person}} present at all the death scenes. The agents visit Waite's house, discovering evidence that she practices witchcraft; however, the audience learns that the evidence was planted there by a staff member of {{the hospital}}. Elsewhere, Dr. Jack Franklin (Richard Beymer) is non-fatally assaulted by Waite at his house. There, Waite is arrested and approached by the agents, who attempt to question Waite but are prevented when she starts to vomit pins, dying shortly thereafter. After the incident, Mulder visits Dr. Jack Franklin, hoping to learn more about Waite's possible motivation. Although Franklin is seemingly innocent, when Mulder leaves the room, he begins to levitate and devilishly smile. Later that night, Mulder deduces that the birthdays of all the victims match up with the dates of the Witches' Sabbath and that Waite was <b>actually</b> <b>trying</b> to protect the victims from Dr. Jack Franklin (she had placed the pentagramsactually protective symbolson and around the victims in the hopes of protecting them from dark magic). This also explains why Waite tried to kill Franklin. Unfortunately, Mulder also realizes that because Waite was not the murderer, the spree of murders will continue. And as he suspected, another patient is murdered with acid back at the hospital.|$|E

25|$|While thought-capable {{artificial}} beings {{appeared as}} storytelling devices in antiquity, {{the idea of}} <b>actually</b> <b>trying</b> to build a machine to perform useful reasoning may have begun with Ramon Llull (c. 1300 CE). With his Calculus ratiocinator, Gottfried Leibniz extended {{the concept of the}} calculating machine (Wilhelm Schickard engineered the first one around 1623), intending to perform operations on concepts rather than numbers. Since the 19th century, artificial beings are common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel Čapek's R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots).|$|E
25|$|On February 15, 1933, Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak {{was shot}} {{three times in}} the chest and mortally wounded while shaking hands with President-elect Franklin D.

A serious debate has ensued as to whether Zangara had been <b>actually</b> <b>trying</b> to assassinate Roosevelt instead of Cermak, however no firm {{evidence}} has been found out to prove this theory.|$|E

He came down heavily on a section of the media for their stand against holding the 10th parliamentary elections in Bangladesh on 5 January 2013, amid a boycott by the main opposition party, alleging that those who were calling for halting the electoral process were <b>actually</b> <b>trying</b> to ensure the participation of Jamaat-e-Islami in the election.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} trial, however, {{the issue is}} not whether John tried to kill Monica but rather whether the officer's entry into the home was lawful. Here, the {{statement}} is not being offered to prove that John tried to kill Monica, but it instead is being offered to prove that the officer had probable cause to enter the home. Whether John was <b>actually</b> <b>trying</b> to kill Monica is irrelevant to the issue at hand; what matters is whether the officer believed that Monica was in danger and whether it had been necessary to kick down the door to investigate further. Monica's statement is evidence to that effect because a reasonable person, having heard Monica's cries for help, would fear for her safety.|$|E

He {{introduces}} himself to Bruce as Ducard, an associate of Ra's, and trains Bruce in martial arts. Later he reveals himself to Bruce, {{as well as his}} intentions to destroy Gotham. Writer David Goyer said he felt he was the most complex of all the Batman villains, comparing him to Osama bin Laden; [...] "He's not crazy in the way that all the other Batman villains are. He's not bent on revenge; he's <b>actually</b> <b>trying</b> to heal the world. He's just doing it by very draconian means." [...] Gary Oldman was first choice for the part, but ended up playing James Gordon instead. Guy Pearce, who collaborated with Christopher Nolan on Memento (2000), reported that the pair had discussions about him playing the role, but both of them decided that he was too young for the part. Neeson is commonly cast as a mentor, so the revelation that his character was the main villain was intended to shock viewers.|$|E

500|$|Kid A {{received}} a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and a nomination for Album of the Year in early 2001. It won both praise and criticism in independent music circles for appropriating underground styles of music; some mainstream British critics saw Kid A as a [...] "commercial suicide note", labelling it [...] "intentionally difficult" [...] and {{longing for a}} return to the band's earlier style. Radiohead's fans were similarly divided; along with those who were appalled or mystified, there were many who saw the album as the band's best work. Yorke, however, denied that Radiohead had set out to eschew commercial expectations, saying: [...] "I was really, really amazed at how badly [...] was being viewed... because the music's not that hard to grasp. We're not trying to be difficult... We're <b>actually</b> <b>trying</b> to communicate but somewhere along the line, we just seemed to piss off a lot of people... What we're doing isn't that radical." [...] The album has since been ranked one of the best of all time by publications including Time and Rolling Stone; Pitchfork, the Times and Rolling Stone named it the best album of the decade.|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club, saying {{that while it}} was an improvement on earlier episodes he had reservations {{about the use of}} Wesley Crusher. He called the [...] "thoughts made flesh concept" [...] a [...] "cliche", but was [...] "gratified to see the series <b>actually</b> <b>trying</b> for something a little beyond their reach, this early in the game". As for Wesley, Handlen thought that it was imposing a [...] "Chosen One narrative" [...] that brought [...] "an unlikable character even further to the forefront of the action simply because some writer didn't get enough pats on the head growing up" [...] and gave the episode a B-minus. Jamahl Epsicokhan, on his website Jammer's Reviews, said that {{it was the first time}} in the series that space itself generated [...] "awe and wonder"; however, he thought the [...] "fresh and intriguing" [...] nature of the episode faded as it went along. He criticized Wesley Crusher, describing him as a [...] "cloying geek" [...] and [...] "you just want to strangle him". He gave the episode a score of 2.5 (out of 4).|$|E
500|$|In {{the seventh}} series, Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) {{is able to}} secure Lucas' release from prison in {{exchange}} for a Russian spy imprisoned in the UK. However, Arkady Kachimov (Stuart Wilson) coerces Lucas to work against MI5, to assist Russia in launching a cyber attack against the UK. In the first episode, Lucas aids section chief Adam Carter (Rupert Penry-Jones) in rescuing a kidnapped soldier and preventing the bombing of a Remembrance Day memorial service; the rescue results in Adam's death. In the second episode, the team begins to suspect Lucas of working for the Russians, but he later reveals that he is <b>actually</b> <b>trying</b> to stop Arkady and the attack; the team succeeds in stopping the attack and apprehends Arkady. Following Adam's death, Lucas is reassigned as Senior Case Officer, and handles Adam's assets. In the third episode, Lucas recalls being tortured and asked for details of [...] "Sugar Horse", a top secret MI5 operation involving the recruitment of Russians who move into top positions in the Russian government. In the penultimate episode, Harry orders Lucas to Moscow to uncover the identity of a Federal Security Service (FSB) mole in MI5 who is sabotaging Sugar Horse and framing Harry. There, Lucas discovers that Connie James (Gemma Jones) is the mole. In the season finale, Section D learns that operation [...] "Tiresias", the Russian equivalent of Sugar Horse, is going to detonate a nuclear bomb in London. Lucas and Ros Myers (Hermione Norris) save Connie from the authorities in order to enlist her help in stopping the attack. After finding the bomb, Connie disarms it, Lucas asks her who sold him out to the Russians and she admits it was her with her final words but she dies in the process as the bomb goes off seconds later.|$|E
