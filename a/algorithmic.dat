5|$|<b>Algorithmic</b> {{analysis}} {{of images of}} artworks, for example using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, can reveal information about art. Such techniques can uncover images in layers of paint later covered over by an artist; help art historians to visualize an artwork before it cracked or faded; help to tell a copy from an original, or distinguish the brushstroke style of a master from those of his apprentices.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{nanotechnology}} {{uses the}} unique molecular recognition properties of DNA and other nucleic acids to create self-assembling branched DNA complexes with useful properties. DNA is thus {{used as a}} structural material {{rather than as a}} carrier of biological information. This has {{led to the creation of}} two-dimensional periodic lattices (both tile-based and using the DNA origami method) and three-dimensional structures in the shapes of polyhedra. Nanomechanical devices and <b>algorithmic</b> self-assembly have also been demonstrated, and these DNA structures have been used to template the arrangement of other molecules such as gold nanoparticles and streptavidin proteins.|$|E

5|$|In the 2013, the perturbational {{complexity}} index (PCI) was proposed, {{a measure}} of the <b>algorithmic</b> complexity of the electrophysiological response of the cortex to transcranial magnetic stimulation. This measure was shown to be higher in individuals that are awake, in REM sleep or in a locked-in state than in those who are in deep sleep or in a vegetative state, making it potentially useful as a quantitative assessment of consciousness states.|$|E
5|$|Intuitively, {{this means}} that every <b>algorithmic</b> {{technique}} or complexity result that applies to H-coloring problems for directed graphs H applies just as well to general CSPs. In particular, one can ask whether the Hell–Nešetřil theorem can be extended to directed graphs. By the above theorem, this {{is equivalent to the}} Feder–Vardi conjecture on CSP dichotomy, which states that for every constraint language Γ, CSP(Γ) is NP-complete or in P.|$|E
5|$|Other {{relationships}} {{include the}} <b>algorithmic</b> analysis of artworks by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, {{the finding that}} traditional batiks from different regions of Java have distinct fractal dimensions, and stimuli to mathematics research, especially Filippo Brunelleschi's theory of perspective, which eventually led to Girard Desargues's projective geometry. A persistent view, based ultimately on the Pythagorean notion of harmony in music, holds that everything was arranged by Number, that God is the geometer of the world, and that therefore the world's geometry is sacred, as seen in artworks such as William Blake's The Ancient of Days.|$|E
50|$|Empirical <b>algorithmics</b> (sometimes {{also called}} {{experimental}} <b>algorithmics)</b> {{is the area}} within computer science that uses empirical methods to study the behaviour of algorithms. It {{can be used in}} the analysis of algorithms.|$|R

5|$|Tile-based structures. This {{approach}} {{breaks the}} target structure into smaller units with strong binding between the strands contained in each unit, and weaker {{interactions between the}} units. It {{is often used to}} make periodic lattices, but {{can also be used to}} implement <b>algorithmic</b> self-assembly, making them a platform for DNA computing. This was the dominant design strategy used from the mid-1990s until the mid-2000s, when the DNA origami methodology was developed.|$|E
5|$|Because {{different}} embeddings {{may lead}} to different dual graphs, testing whether one graph is a dual of another (without already knowing their embeddings) is a nontrivial <b>algorithmic</b> problem. For biconnected graphs, it can be solved in polynomial time by using the SPQR trees of the graphs to construct a canonical form for the equivalence relation of having a shared mutual dual. For instance, the two red graphs in the illustration are equivalent according to this relation. However, for planar graphs that are not biconnected, this relation is not an equivalence relation {{and the problem of}} testing mutual duality is NP-complete.|$|E
5|$|In {{computer}} science, integer sorting is the <b>algorithmic</b> {{problem of}} sorting {{a collection of}} data values by numeric keys, {{each of which is}} an integer. Algorithms designed for integer sorting may also often be applied to sorting problems in which the keys are floating point numbers, rational numbers, or text strings. The ability to perform integer arithmetic on the keys allows integer sorting algorithms to be faster than comparison sorting algorithms in many cases, depending on the details of which operations are allowed in the model of computing and how large the integers to be sorted are.|$|E
