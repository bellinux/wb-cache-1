500|$|After {{the high}} levels of {{criticism}} aimed at the Aliens Act, Churchill decided to strengthen the legislation, and proposed the Aliens (Prevention of Crime) Bill under the Ten Minute Rule. The MP Josiah C Wedgwood objected, and wrote to Churchill to ask him not to introduce the hard-line measures [...] "You know <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> that human life does not matter a rap in comparison with the death of ideas and the betrayal of English traditions." [...] The bill did not become law.|$|E
500|$|Vickers, {{who would}} leave Hendrick Motorsports in 2007 for Red Bull Racing Team, said: [...] "I would {{expect them to}} be a little upset. Jimmie is my friend, my teammate, and he is running for a championship. But he knows just <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> that if I wasn't bump-drafting, he never would have had a shot to pass Junior." [...] Additionally, he denied that he drove more aggressively because he was leaving. Third-place {{finisher}} Kurt Busch argued Vickers was in a [...] "Catch-22" [...] situation: [...] "He was trying to help his teammate. It just didn't turn out that way. Vickers was doing the best he could to help the 48. He just didn't anticipate the 8 car blocking as long as he did." [...] Vickers would later receive additional security during the next race weekend.|$|E

He has [...] "a crushing sense of his predicament"(196) and asks her to tell no one. In a letter, Arthur tells Cope he must end the engagement promptly: [...] "This thing can't go on, and you know it <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> Nip it. Nip it now. Don't think that our intimacy is to end in any such fashion as this, for it isn't..."(197) ...|$|E

2500|$|Domingo first sang Mario Cavaradossi in Puccini's Tosca in a 1961 {{performance}} in Mexico City. A decade later, {{he made his}} Covent Garden debut in the role. He continued to sing the part for many years, especially at the Met and in Vienna, eventually performing it {{more than any other}} of his roles. In September 1975, Domingo debuted in the title role of Verdi's Otello at the Hamburg State Opera. It soon became his signature role and one of operas he performed most frequently (over 200 times). He recorded the part three times in the studio and appeared in four officially released filmed versions of the opera. Oscar-winning Shakespearean actor, Laurence Olivier, declared after seeing the tenor in the role: [...] "Domingo plays Othello <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> and he has that voice." ...|$|E
