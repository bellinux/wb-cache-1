40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to identify the potential of new deep-sea fisheries in the Colombian Caribbean Sea determining their biomass and spatial distribution in order to advice management and conservation strategies, based on ecosystem approach to fisheries management. First, I examine morphological characteristics of the shallow water pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus notialis to investigate stock differentiation, presenting biological data such as size at 50 % sexual maturity. The data onF. notialis were obtained from samples collected from June to December 2004, on board of commercial fishing vessels and from a time series of historic landings of catch and effort data. I did not find morphometric variability between the studied regions, which indicates the existence of a single population of F. notialis from a morphometric point of view. This study provides the first complete view, to date, of the stock structure and fishery dynamics of the pink shrimp F. notialis in the Colombian Caribbean Sea. This fishery is a typical case in which high exploitation, combined with non-existent fisheries management, have resulted in the significant depletion of stock. In response to this, I investigate possible new fishing areas, exploring the poorly understood deep sea habitats in the Colombian Caribbean Sea, to determine the potential for a viable deep-sea crustacean fishery. The sampling area extended from 100 m the isobaths to 600 m depth. I found high abundances ofthe giant red shrimp (Aristaeomorpha foliacea), the royal red shrimp (Pleoticus robustus), the pink speckled deep-sea shrimp (Penaeopsis serrata) and the deep-sea lobster (Metanephrops binghami) obtained in two experimental trawl surveys carried out in November and December 2009, all of which are important commercially. The highest biomassess of these deep-sea crustaceans species were found mainly in the northern zone of the Colombian Caribbean Sea, where the local oceanography is modulated by high productive seasonal upwelling. However, further scientific assessment is necessary to determine population life cycle parameters of these deep-sea crustaceans and associated biodiversity before initiating a new commercial fishery. Studies of deep-sea biodiversity are necessary {{in order to understand the}} degree of stability and vulnerability of deep-sea environments and enable comparison of conditions before and after exploitation of the fishery. This will enable a better understanding of the ecosystem, to advise ecosystem-based conservation and fisheries management strategies. The aim of thislaststudy was to identify deep-sea fish assemblages across a depth range of 200 - 550 m from the Colombian Caribbean Sea and their implications for an ecosystem approach to fisheries management. Classification (Cluster analysis) and ordination (non-parametric multidimensional scaling NMDS) were performed to identify deep-sea fish assemblages. A total of 102 species (13 Chondrichthyes and 89 Teleosteans) and 58 families (9 Chondrichthyes and 49 Teleosteans) of deep-sea fish were sampled. This study reveals the existence of three deep-sea fish assemblages and demostrates that depth plays an important role in ichthyofaunal differentiation. I conclude that, the management of the shallow shrimp fishery and the potential new deep-sea crustacean fishery should be based on an ecosystem approach that considers population dynamics and structure, the optimum <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>catches</b> and effort, protection of nursery and spawning areas, the development of monitoring strategies and the care of ecosystems...|$|E

40|$|Extract] Identification of {{fish stocks}} is {{necessary}} to fisheries management for <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> between competing fisheries, recognition and protection of nursery and spawning areas, and for development of optimal harvest and monitoring strategies (Kutkuhn, 1981; Grimes et al., 1987; Smith et al., 1990; Begg et al., 1999 a). A fish “stock” can {{be considered to be}} a group of randomly mating, reproductively isolated individuals with temporal or spatial integrity (Ihssen et al., 1981), which may exhibit differences in vital population or life history parameters compared to other stocks of the same species (Begg and Waldman, 1999). Differences in these life history parameters among groups of fish have long been used as a basis for the identification of fish stocks because of the relative ease of assessing these parameters and their dual functionality as input into fisheries stock assessment and management strategies. In this chapter, I review and critique the range of life history parameters that have typically been used in stock identification studies and provide guidance for the effective protocol of the use of life history parameters in fish stock identification...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The recent {{expansion}} of the longline commercial fishery has heightened the conflicts among various fisheries in Hawaii, especially between longliners and non-longline commercial (troll and handline) and recreational fishing boats. The recent court ruling against longline fishing on some waters around Hawaiian islands may provide an impetus for the {{expansion of}} the non-longline commercial activities, which in turn may give rise to conflicts between non-longline commercial and recreational fisheries. This study examines the economic impacts <b>of</b> the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> from one nonlongline commercial fishing trip to recreational fishing using the 1992 input-output model of the state of Hawaii. The results show that the total impact on value added per unit of fish landed is greater for recreational fishing than commercial fishing, while total impacts on income and employment are greater for commercial fishing. When forward-linked trade and distribution services of final demands are also included, total value added, income, and employment impacts are all higher for commercial fishing and hence net impacts <b>of</b> <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> the commercial fishery to the recreational/expense fishery are all negative. Furthermore, when the effects of an equivalent decrease in personal consumption expenditures (PCE) of other sectors due to an increase in expenditures in recreational fishing are also included, total losses on value added, income, and employment become more significant. However, relative to direct impacts indirect impacts on value added, income and employment are higher for recreational fishing than for commercial fishing such that the corresponding net indirect effects are positive in all cases...|$|R
40|$|Assessing {{patterns}} of fisheries activity at a scale related to resource exploitation has re-ceived particular attention in recent times. However, acquiring {{data about the}} distribution and spatiotemporal <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> and fishing effort in small scale benthic fisheries re-mains challenging. Here, we used GIS-based spatio-statistical models to investigate the footprint of commercial diving events on blacklip abalone (Haliotis rubra) stocks along the south-west coast of Victoria, Australia from 2008 to 2011. Using abalone catch data matched with GPS location we found <b>catch</b> per unit <b>of</b> fishing effort (CPUE) was not uniform-ly spatially and temporally distributed across the study area. Spatial autocorrelation and hotspot analysis revealed significant spatiotemporal clusters of CPUE (with distance thresh-olds of 100 ’s of meters) among years, indicating the presence of CPUE hotspots focused on specific reefs. Cumulative hotspot maps indicated that certain reef complexes were con-sistently targeted across years but with varying intensity, however often a relatively small proportion of the full reef extent was targeted. Integrating CPUE with remotely-sensed {{light detection and ranging}} (LiDAR) derived bathymetry data using generalized additive mixed model corroborated that fishing pressure primarily coincided with shallow, rugose and com-plex components of reef structures.

However, there is concern about the basic effectiveness of quota regulation due to widespread non-compliance. In this paper we develop a model of enforcement in a quota regulated renewable resource industry and consider a case with significant non-compliance, and with exogenous constraints on fines and enforcement budget. We propose a reform of the enforcement system by introducing self reporting of excess extraction and (explicit) differentiation of inspection rates based on compliance history. We show that the proposed reform increases the effectiveness of quota management and allows the regulator to implement a wider range of aggregate extraction targets than under the traditional enforcement system. This is shown without violating the inspection budget constraint or the fine constraint, and while ensuring an efficient <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> aggregate <b>catch...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{nature and}} impact of fishing on predators that share a fished {{resource}} is an important consideration in ecosystem-based fisheries management. Krill (Euphausia superba) is a keystone species in the Antarctic, serving as a fundamental forage source for predators and simultaneously being subject to fishing. We developed a spatial multispecies operating model (SMOM) of krill–predator fishery dynamics to help advise on <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> the total krill catch among 15 small-scale management units (SSMUs) in the Scotia Sea, with a goal to reduce {{the potential impact of}} fishing on krill predators. The operating model describes the underlying population dynamics and is used in simulations to compare different management options for adjusting fishing activities (e. g., a different spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>catches).</b> The numerous uncertainties regarding the choice of parameter values pose a major impediment to constructing reliable ecosystem models. The pragmatic solution proposed here involves the use of operating models that are composed of alternative combinations of parameters that essentially try to bound the uncertainty in, for example, the choice of survival rate estimates as well as the functional relationships between predators and prey. Despite the large uncertainties, it is possible to discriminate the ecosystem impacts of different spatial fishing allocations. The spatial structure of the model is fundamental to addressing concerns of localized depletion of prey in the vicinity of land-based predator breeding colonies. Results of the model have been considered in recent management deliberations for spatial <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> krill <b>catches</b> in the Scotia Sea and their associated impacts on dependent predator species...|$|R

Bibliography: leaves 107 - 114. ix, 114 leaves, bound ill. 28 cmThe {{objectives}} of the study are to include endogenous supply and uncertainty in a fisheries market analysis and to provide an economic explanation for the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> total <b>catch</b> between two markets, a fresh fish market and a cannery market. In order to accomplish these objectives, an econometric model of the Hawaiian skipjack tuna market was constructed and evaluated. A five equation model was specified which determined the monthly number of fishing trips taken, the total catch, the quantity supplied to the fresh market, the fresh market price and the revenues received from the cannery. The effect of seasonal variation in availability of fish {{was included in the}} specification of the model. Uncertainty was included through a variable which reflected the probability of a successful trip. The estimation technique was three-stage-least squares (3 SLS). This method was selected because of the hypothesized simultaneous relationships and because of the known properties of the technique. Monthly time-series data for 1970 - 78 were used. The results of the estimation show that the probability <b>of</b> a non-zero <b>catch</b> trip and the expected revenues from cannery sales were positive determinants of the monthly number of trips taken. Total monthly catch is positively related to the number of trips and to the expected revenues from cannery sales and negatively related to the price of gasoline. The quantity supplied to the fresh fish market is negatively related to revenues from the cannery implying substitution between the two markets. Quantity sold to the fresh market is also positively determined by total catch in the off season with no empirical relationship observed in the on season between the quantity sold and total <b>catch.</b> The number <b>of</b> vessels fishing is a positive determinant of quantity supplied to the fresh market. The market price is negatively related to the quantity supplied and positively related to per capita income and average size of fish caught. The elasticity of demand for the fresh fish market is calculated to be - 1. 8. The revenues from the cannery are determined by the wholesale price of canned tuna, the fresh market price and the total <b>catch.</b> The conclusions <b>of</b> the study indicate that endogenous supply is an appropriate specification in this market; that the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> total <b>catch</b> between the markets is occurring by equalizing marginal revenues; and that uncertainty is a major determinant of the number of trips taken...|$|R
2500|$|A common {{criticism}} of the CFP is its centralised, top-down approach to management; although Member States {{are responsible for the}} policy's implementation and enforcement, the EU adopts sole competence in the creation of proposals and the making of decisions. The Commission is not exclusively responsible for the setting <b>of</b> total allowable <b>catches.</b> These are proposed by the commission but ultimately determined by the Council <b>of</b> Ministers. [...] <b>Allocation</b> <b>of</b> national <b>catch</b> quotas to Member States is on a pre-determined basis—the so-called relative stability—giving each member state pre-determined percentages of the available fishing opportunities. Although Member States hold some responsibilities, such as the distribution of quotas, it is argued that the EU retains too much authority over fisheries management. Furthermore, critics maintain that the organisation is ill-suited to the task of fisheries management as it lacks sufficient understanding of fisheries, and is too far removed from the realities of the industry to set accurate TACs and quotas. The command-and-control method characterised by the CFP is no longer deemed an effective form of fisheries management, and advocates of CFP reform consider a shift from traditional government to participatory third-order governance, incorporating the fisheries industry and Member States, to be vital {{to the success of the}} policy.|$|R
40|$|Local {{communities}} {{and local government}} units are recognized as the primary stakeholders and participants {{in the management of}} coral reef resources and the primary beneficiaries of small-scale fishing activities in the nearshore areas of the coastal zone. The issues relating to the management of the coastal zone are multi-faceted and some issues are largely intertwined with national policy and development goals. Thus, national governments have jurisdiction over these nearshore coastal resources to harmonize policies, monitor resource use and provide incentives for sustainable use. However, the natural boundaries of these reef resources, the processes that support reef ecosystems, and the local or national affiliation of the people who benefit from them may transcend the boundaries of the local and national management units. Therefore, efforts to arrest the decline in fish <b>catch</b> and loss <b>of</b> biodiversity for reefs require management interventions and assessment activities to be carried out at varying scales. In Southeast Asia, some aspects of reef and reef resources management — particularly in deciding the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> among competing fisheries, development of sustainable harvest strategies, use of broodstock for restocking or stock enhancement programs, protection of nursery and spawning areas, designation of systems of marine protected areas, and the identification of representative, adequate and comprehensive areas for biodiversity conservation in the region — may require the definition of larger management units. At the regional level, multi-country initiatives will need to define units for the transboundary management of resources. The use of large marine ecosystems (LMEs) to identify and manage fisheries resources may be a starting point; however, given the relatively sedentary nature of coral reef-dwelling and reef-associated organisms compared with other pelagic and demersal species, meso-scale transboundary units within the LMEs have to be defined. This paper provides suggestions for transboundary management units for coral reef and reef-associated resources in Southeast Asia based on information from genetic structures of model organisms in the region. In addition, specific reef areas are identified, which may be important beyond their national boundaries, as potential sources of recruits.

40|$|Research PaperAlthough the 1982 UNCLOS endeavoured to {{establish}} EEZs and assist coastal states {{in being able}} to manage the resources throughout their range to some extent, it became obvious that further agreements were necessary to expand upon states’ international obligations in relation to conservation and management of living resources on the High Seas. The 1995 Agreement concluded {{as a result of the}} United Nations Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and a number of other international agreements have set the scene for significant change in High Seas fisheries management. In particular, through the auspices of regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) and arrangements, state parties will be under an obligation to co-operate and agree, where appropriate, on participatory rights in High Seas fisheries, including <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> allowable <b>catch</b> or levels <b>of</b> fishing effort.

Abalone resources are comprised of many independent populations which vary widely in their size of maturity.

40|$|In the {{southern}} Benguela ecosystem off South Africa, there were recent shifts {{to the south}} and east in the distributions of three forage resources (anchovy, sardine, rock lobster), which probably were influenced by environmental change although fishing too may have played a part. In this study, we review information on trends in distributions and numbers of eight seabirds breeding in South Africa. For five species that feed predominantly on anchovy, sardine or rock lobster, their populations off northwest South Africa decreased markedly. For three of these species, which exhibit behavioural inertia and have restricted foraging ranges when breeding (African penguin, Cape cormorant, bank cormorant), there were large decreases in their overall populations in South Africa. Conversely, for two showing more plasticity and able to range over wide areas or move between breeding localities (Cape gannet, swift tern) there were increases. It is thought that movement of forage resources away from the northern islands led to a mismatch in the distributions of breeding localities and prey of dependent seabirds off western South Africa and to attempts by several species to establish colonies on {{the southern}} mainland closer to food resources. There also were shifts {{to the south and}} east in the distributions of three seabirds that do not compete with fisheries for prey (crowned cormorant, white-breasted cormorant, kelp gull), suggesting some environmental forcing, but decreases of these species off northwest South Africa were less severe and populations in South Africa remained stable or increased in the long term. It is likely, because many fishing plants are located in the northwest, that there was increased competition between seabirds and fisheries for prey as forage resources moved south and east. Potential interventions to mitigate the adverse impacts of distributional changes for seabirds include <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> allowable <b>catches</b> <b>of</b> shared forage resources at regional levels...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} concern amongst the scientific community and {{those responsible for the}} management of the Antarctic krill fishery that the harvesting of this species will soon increase to unprecedented levels. This concern has been prompted by numerous factors including, but not limited to, increased and diversified participation in the fishery, advances in technology, the rapid decline of global fish stocks and an ever-increasing global population. This study examined the development and current management of the fishery for Antarctic knIt (Euphausia superba) in the Southern Ocean with a view to identifying and recommending possible future management strategies to deal with new directions in the industry. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources aims to manage the krill fishery in line with its precautionary and ecosystem based approach to management In order to fulfil its objectives and allow for orderly development of the fishery, it is necessary for it to be kept informed about the economic drivers. However, currently, there is very limited knowledge available to the Commission {{on the nature of the}} marketplace for Antarctic krill. This study used data from the Commission, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, publicly available patent libraries, published literature, industry participants and commodities marketplace to investigate the management and development of the krill fishery. Mechanisms used by the Commission to track the development of the fishery to date, and new tools developed in this study to detect likely future trends in the fishery, indicated that not only is interest in the fishery increasing in terms of participation and investment, but the marketplace for krill has expanded, with a number of new markets (including pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals) likely to expand considerably in coming years. The principal finding of the study was that the krill fishery has been exempted from many of the tighter regulatory controls that other fisheries in the Southern Ocean were subjected to. However, to ensure that the development of the fishery is consistent with its approach to management, and accounts for this fishery's recent rapid development, the Commission will need to adopt tighter regulatory controls including, but not limited to, mandatory observer coverage for all krill fishing vessels, more rigorous application of the existing vessel monitoring system's reporting requirements and <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> limits across smaller management units to mitigate against overfishing in important predator foraging grounds. The Commission has already acted on several of the outcomes and subsequent recommendations from this study that had been submitted to its Working Group on Ecosystem Monitoring and Management and the Scientific Committee as background papers. For example, the Commission ordered a review of the observer program, which has since led to more detailed information both in the observers' notification reports and in the notification form (on gear specifications). In addition, the Commission adopted the use of the patent database developed during this study as a tool for tracking interest and possible developments in the fishery...|$|R

It remains to be seen if these goals and objectives will be the cornerstone <b>of</b> future <b>allocation</b> and management or like those of the late 1970 s and early 1980 s will be neither adhered to nor attained...|$|R
40|$|The {{west coast}} rock lobster {{assessment}} of 20061 {{based on data}} to 2004 is updated to include data up to 2008. Over {{the last four years}} the exploitable biomass trend is upwards for Areas 7 and 8 and the resource as a whole, but downwards for Areas 5 + 6 and almost level for Areas 1 + 2 and 3 + 4. The overall increase since 2006 is significant at the 5 % level. While better than median projections at the time the current OMP developed, the increase remains within the 95 % probability intervals calculated at the time. An updated version of the Spatial Multi-species Operating Model (SMOM) of krillpredator-fishery dynamics is described. This has been developed in response to requests for scientific advice regarding the subdivision <b>of</b> the precautionary <b>catch</b> limit for krill among 15 small-scale management units (SSMUs) in the Scotia Sea, to reduce the potential impact of fishing on land-based predators. 2. The numerous uncertainties regarding the appropriate choice of parameter values in multi-species models is a major impediment. A pragmatic method proposed involves use of an operating model comprising alternative combinations that essentially try to bound the uncertainty in, for example, the choice of survival rate estimates as well as the functional relationships between predators and prey. 3. The operating model is assumed to simulate the “true” dynamics of the resource and is used to test decision rules for adjusting fishing activities (e. g. catch limits) based on field data forthcoming in the future. 4. An illustrative Management Procedure (MP) that includes a feedback structure is shown to perform better in terms of low risk to predators within each SSMU, than an approach lacking the ability to react and self-correct. 5. This modeling framework provides an example of a method for bounding some of the uncertainty associated with multi-species models used for management. Results are presented as probability envelopes rather than in point estimate form, giving a truer reflection of the uncertainty inherent in outcomes predicted on the basis of multi-species models, as well as highlighting how such probability envelopes could be narrowed given improved data on key parameters such as survival. Results are useful for evaluating the relative merits <b>of</b> different spatial <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> krill <b>catches.</b> An example is given of 2 how such a framework can be used to develop a management scheme which includes feedback through management control rules...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fishery managers, economists, {{industry}} advocates, {{and some}} environmental public interest groups are currently promoting catch shares (or the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> exclusive {{portions of the}} total allowable catch) {{as a means to}} address both environmental and economic fishery management problems. At the same time, a vocal opposition to catch share management has developed among some industry stakeholders, academics, and other public interest groups. Over {{the course of the last}} 20 years, while the debate has percolated, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (known henceforth as the Council) has incrementally developed and overseen the implementation <b>of</b> five major <b>catch</b> share management programs for the fisheries it governs. This article draws on the experiences in the North Pacific fisheries to shed light on several facets of the debate over the efficacy <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> share management and suggests that catch share management is most effective and beneficial to stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|Abstract only. The New England Multispecies (groundfish) {{fishery is}} about to {{implement}} the catch share management system, where self-identified groups of harvesters called sectors receive quota <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> total allowable <b>catch</b> (TAC) proportional to the harvest history of their members. Joining a sector is voluntary, thus there will be both sector members and non-sector members, which will remain in a common pool fishery, coexisting in this fishery. Basic game theory tells us that relative profitability between the sector and non-sector will dictate the flow of membership, while the profitability itself is a inversely related function of membership size. This raises an important question: will a success of a sector, measured by its increased profitability (rent), ultimately undermine the sustainability of that sector? What are the characteristics of an equilibrium, and how would that be affected by (a) the dynamics of biology (fish population) and economics (rent generation), and (b) the management scheme chosen by a sector? This paper develops a microeconomic model of fishers behavior under sector allocation program based on the differential game theory, and solves for dynamic equilibrium in aim to answer these questions. The first model developed is where sector members with individual quota coexisting with non-sector members. Generally, sector members will wait until the nonsector members reach their collective quota, but an interesting result {{is that there will}} be some sector members who will opt to fish with the non-sector members. Revenue sharing in aim to foster collective effort coordination within a sector is also considered...|$|R
40|$|In August of 2005, {{fishing in}} the Bering Sea and Aleutian Island crab {{fisheries}} began under a new sharebased management program (the “rationalization program”). Under the program, <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> IFQ to harvesters and IPQ to processors are binding without provision to cover any overage or compensate for any underage. This action considers allowing harvesters and processors to engage in post-delivery transfer of their respective shares to cover overages. Purpose and Need Statement The Council has adopted the following the purpose and need statement for this action: Under the crab rationalization program, harvesters receive annual <b>allocations</b> <b>of</b> individual fishing quota that provide an exclusive privilege to harvest a specific number of pounds of crab from a fishery. Any harvest in excess of an individual fishing quota allocation is a regulatory violation punishable by confiscation of crab or other penalties. Precisely estimating <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> at sea during the fishery is difficult and costly due to variation in size of crab, and sorting and measurement requirements. Overages can result from mistakes by participants attempting to accurately estimate catch. The inability to address overages also impedes flexibility in attempting to optimally harvest IFQ.
