5|$|Deinosuchus had a {{secondary}} bony palate, {{which would have}} permitted it to breathe through its nostrils {{while the rest of}} the head remained submerged underwater. The vertebrae were articulated in a procoelous manner, meaning they had a concave hollow on the front end and a convex bulge on the rear; these would have fit together to produce <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> socket joint. The secondary palate and procoelous vertebrae are advanced features also found in modern eusuchian crocodilians.|$|E

In 2017 a German company made an arm with a soft pneumatically controlled silicone gripper fitted with two rows of suckers.

5|$|Videoball is {{a minimalist}} sports video game by Action Button Entertainment. Up to six human and {{computer-controlled}} players form two teams.

The objective is to knock {{the ball into the}} opposing team's goal. Apart from exhibition matches, the game has a scenario challenge-based Arcade mode, and supports online team and ranked multiplayer matchmaking. Videoball has a simple visual style with bright colors, basic shapes, and many customization options.|$|E

5|$|A {{right-handed}} {{batter and}} wicket-keeper, {{she is the}} daughter of Greg Healy, who was part of the Queensland squad, while her uncle Ian Healy was Australia's Test wicket-keeper and held the world record for the most Test dismissals. Healy first came to prominence in late 2006 when she became the first girl to play among boys in the private schools' competition in New South Wales. She moved up the state age group ranks and made her debut for the senior New South Wales team in the 200708 season. She played most of her first two seasons as a specialist batsman due to the presence of Leonie Colemana wicket-keeper for Australiain the state side. Coleman left New South Wales {{at the start of the}} 200910 season and Healy took up the glovework on a full-time basis for her state. During the same season, she recorded her highest score of 89 not out at faster than a run <b>a</b> <b>ball,</b> <b>and</b> made the most dismissals of any wicket-keeper in the Women's National Cricket League.|$|E
5|$|As {{recreational}} facilities and grass ovals were sparse in densely populated Fitzroy, Merv {{and his younger}} brothers played cricket in a cobblestone laneway between their terraced house. Here they played cricket with a tennis ball, home made cricket bat and a kerosene tin for a wicket. They were usually joined by other local children, two of whom became elite sportsmen: Allan Ruthven and Harold Shillinglaw. The group also played Australian rules football, kicking around rolled up cardboard and newspaper. Much of the batting skill displayed by the Harvey brothers {{has been attributed to}} these games played on the unpredictable bounce of the bumpy laneway. The surface also had a V-shaped slope inwards towards the centre of the lane, causing balls to deviate sideways after bouncing. As the laneway meant that the playing area was long and narrow, the young boys also had to learn to play the ball straight in accordance with orthodox cricket technique. The Harveys played another form of cricket in their concreted backyard using a marble instead of <b>a</b> <b>ball,</b> <b>and</b> a miniature bat. This sharpened their reflexes.|$|E
5|$|The katipo has {{medically}} significant venom in humans, although bites are rare. The {{incidence of}} bites is low {{as it is}} a shy, non-aggressive spider. Their narrow range, diminishing population, and human awareness of where they live means interaction between humans and the spider is minimal. The katipo will only bite as a last resort; if molested, the spider will usually fold up into <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> drop to the ground or retreat to the nearest cover. If the threat continues, the spider may throw out silk against the interference. When restrained in any way or held against skin, such as if tangled up in clothing, the spider will then bite defensively. However, if the female is with an egg sac it will remain close by it and sometimes move offensively to bite any threat.|$|E

5|$|The {{story begins}} as a girl named Sally and her unnamed brother, who serves as the narrator of the book, sit alone in their house on a cold, rainy day, staring wistfully out the window. Then they hear a loud bump which is quickly {{followed}} {{by the arrival of}} the Cat in the Hat, a tall anthropomorphic cat in a red and white striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat proposes to entertain the children with some tricks that he knows. The children's pet fish refuses, insisting that the Cat leave. The Cat responds by balancing the fish on the tip of his umbrella. The game quickly becomes more complicated, as the Cat balances himself on <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> tries to balance lots of household items on his limbs until he falls on his head, dropping everything he was holding. The fish admonishes him again, but the Cat in the Hat just proposes another game.|$|E
5|$|With {{the growing}} Caribbean {{following}} in England, the West Indies entered the series {{as one of}} the most popular touring nations. Lance Gibbs' 11 wickets at Old Trafford set up a commanding 10 wicket win for the West Indies. The second match at Lord's was chiefly remembered for its dramatic ending; all results were possible going into the final over of the match. England required eight runs to win but only had two wickets left. From the fourth ball of the over Derek Shackleton was run out, which meant that Colin Cowdrey had to come out with a broken arm with two balls of the match remaining. He did not have to face <b>a</b> <b>ball,</b> <b>and</b> the match ended in a draw. The third Test saw Fred Trueman claim 12 wickets ensuring England won by 217 runs. Charlie Griffith's 6/36 in the fourth and Conrad Hunte's 108 in the final Test meant the West Indies won the next two Tests and the series finished 3–1. The final Test saw a pitch invasion when Basil Butcher scored the winning runs for the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|Protosuchians were small, mostly {{terrestrial}} animals with short snouts and long limbs. They had bony armor {{in the form}} of two rows of plates extending from head to tail, and this armor is retained by most modern crocodilians. Their vertebrae were convex on the two main articulating surfaces, and their bony palates were little developed. The mesosuchians saw a fusion of the palatine bones to form a secondary bony palate and a great extension of the nasal passages to near the pterygoid bones. This allowed the animal to breathe through its nostrils while its mouth was open under the water. The eusuchians continued this process with the interior nostrils now opening through an aperture in the pterygoid bones. The vertebrae of eusuchians had one convex and one concave articulating surface, allowing for <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> socket type joint between the vertebrae, bringing greater flexibility and strength. The oldest known eusuchian is Hylaeochampsa vectiana from the lower Cretaceous of the Isle of Wight in the United Kingdom. It was followed by crocodilians such as the Pristichampsidae, the so-called 'hoofed crocodiles', in the Palaeogene. Spanning the Cretaceous and Palaeogene periods is the genus Borealosuchus of North America, with six species, though its phylogenetic position is not settled.|$|E

5|$|The {{relatively}} modest Coronet of Frederick {{was made in}} 1728 for Frederick, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of GeorgeII. It takes the form laid down in a royal warrant issued by CharlesII which states that the heir apparent of the Crown shall use and bear a coronet of crosses and fleurs-de-lis with one arch surmounted by <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> cross. The single arch denotes that the Prince of Wales is inferior to the monarch but outranks the other royal children, whose coronets have no arches. Frederick never wore his gold coronet; instead, it was placed on a cushion {{in front of him}} when he took his seat in the House of Lords. It was used by his son, GeorgeIII, then his son, GeorgeIV, and last used by EdwardVII when he was Prince of Wales. Due to its age, a new silver-gilt coronet was made for his son, the future GeorgeV, to wear at Edward's coronation in 1902. In contrast to the earlier coronet, which has a depressed arch, the arch on this one is raised. At George's own coronation in 1911, the coronet was worn by his son, Edward, the next Prince of Wales. After he became king in 1936, EdwardVIII abdicated later the same year and, as the Duke of Windsor, went into exile in France, taking the 1902 coronet with him; it remained abroad until his death in 1972. In its absence, another coronet had to be made for the investiture of Prince Charles in 1969. Unlike the defunct coronets, this one is {{not a part of the}} Crown Jewels but the Honours of the Principality of Wales.|$|E
