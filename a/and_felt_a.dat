5|$|The Nazi era {{continues}} to inform how Germans view {{themselves and their}} country. Virtually every family suffered losses during the war or has a story to tell, though Germans kept quiet about their experiences <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> sense of communal guilt, {{even if they were}} not directly involved in war crimes. Once study of Nazi Germany was introduced into the school curriculum starting in the 1970s, as people began researching the experiences of their family members. Study of the era and a willingness to critically examine its mistakes has {{led to the development of}} a strong democracy in today's Germany, but with lingering undercurrents of antisemitism and neo-Nazi thought.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, the Autobot penal {{facility}} on Garrus-9 is {{attacked by the}} Combaticons, who escape with the Monstructor component Transformers, forcing a reluctant Fortress Maximus to dispatch Arcee to track them down. Learning of this, Prime pulls Prowl's detachment away from Earth to help contain the problem, though Hot Rod elects to stay to learn Sunstreaker's fate. Nightbeat also suspects someone has tampered with his memory. Elsewhere, Sixshot, having encountered <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> kinship with the Reapers before, defects to their side, but is taken out by a returned Starscream (revived by the other Decepticons {{to stand up to}} Megatron), leading to a full-scale battle between the Decepticons and Reapers. The Decepticons win, with aid from Galvatron, who escapes with Sixshot's body as the US military locates the Decepticons' base. Scorponok merges with the human Dante into a new body, but is unable to prevent Hunter, now merged with Sunstreaker's mind in a copy of his body, from escaping. In the Dead Universe Nemesis Prime, Jhiaxus, and Galvatron agree the endgame is about to begin.|$|E
5|$|The {{arguments}} {{that led to}} the cancellation of the B-70 program had led some to question the need for a new strategic bomber of any sort. The USAF was adamant about retaining bombers as part of the nuclear triad concept that included bombers, ICBMs, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) in a combined package that complicated any potential defense. They argued that the bomber was needed to attack hardened military targets and to provide a safe counterforce option because the bombers could be quickly launched into safe loitering areas where they could not be attacked. However, the introduction of the SLBM made moot the mobility and survivability argument, and a newer generation of ICBMs, such as the Minuteman III, had the accuracy and speed needed to attack point targets. During this time, ICBMs were seen as a less costly option based on their lower unit cost, but development costs were much higher. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara preferred ICBMs over bombers for the Air Force portion of the deterrent force <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> new expensive bomber was not needed. McNamara limited the AMSA program to studies and component development beginning in 1964.|$|E

60|$|Fully {{five minutes}} passed <b>and</b> Giant <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> small nibble. He pulled the bait around <b>a</b> bit <b>and</b> then <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> sudden tug. Up came his {{line with a}} rush, and out on the ice flopped a {{pickerel}} of fair size.|$|R
60|$|Her voice trembled <b>a</b> little, <b>and</b> I <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> brute even to hesitate.|$|R
25|$|Many mystics {{experience}} visions. But other sensory {{experiences are}} common as well. For instance, Richard Rolle heard heavenly music <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> {{fire in his}} chest.|$|E
25|$|In 1958 France was in {{the middle}} of the Algerian War <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> need for a {{counter-insurgency}} aircraft capable of observation, photography and ground support. This official programme led to three aircraft: the SIPA S.1100, the Sud Aviation SE-116 Voltigeur and, slightly later, the Dassault Spirale. All three were propeller driven designs with twin engines.|$|E
25|$|At the time, {{the use of}} radial {{engines in}} {{land-based}} fighters was relatively rare in Europe, as {{it was believed that}} their large frontal area would cause too much drag on something as small as a fighter. Tank was not convinced of this, having witnessed the successful use of radial engines by the U.S. Navy, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> properly streamlined installation would eliminate this problem.|$|E
60|$|Averil assented, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> it <b>a</b> dreary {{thing to}} have an {{incomparable}} brother.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> he <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> nameless fear {{creep into}} his heart, making him shiver again.|$|R
2500|$|On being filmed, Kastor {{said that}} she [...] "went about her normal routine and training", and commented it that was not distracting, but [...] "motivating". Kastor also {{revealed}} that the six runners did not meet until a brunch after the marathon, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> [...] "immediate bond of friendship".|$|R
25|$|In 1913, {{when she}} was about 16 years old, her father retired and the family moved to Florence. She stated that in 1916 she had a {{personal}} religious experience <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> closeness to God which transformed her life. In 1917, during the First World War, she volunteered as a Samaritan nurse and for 18 months worked at the military hospital in Florence.|$|E

This official programme led to three aircraft: the SIPA S.1100, the Sud Aviation SE.116 Voltigeur and, slightly later the Dassault Spirale. All three were propeller driven designs with twin engines, though the SIPA was the only one never fitted with turboprops.|$|E
25|$|Keyes admired Ted Bundy {{and shared}} several {{similarities}} with him: Both were methodical <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> possession over their victims. However, there are notable differences. Bundy's murders were {{spread throughout the}} country, mainly because he lived in many different areas, and not as an intentional effort to avoid detection {{as was the case}} with Keyes. Bundy targeted only attractive young women, usually with hair parted down the middle, while Keyes had no particular type of victim.|$|E

60|$|There was {{no mistaking}} the reality of his words, the genuine pity and {{tenderness}} of his action; but the woman saw before her only the familiar dupe of her life, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> infinite relief mingled with a certain contempt for his weakness and anger at her previous fears of him.|$|R
25|$|On 11 April 1951, Commander-in-Chief Truman {{relieved}} {{the controversial}} General MacArthur, the Supreme Commander in Korea. There were {{several reasons for}} the dismissal. MacArthur crossed the 38th parallel in the mistaken belief that the Chinese would not enter the war, leading to major allied losses. He believed that whether to use nuclear weapons should be his decision, not the President's. MacArthur threatened to destroy China unless it surrendered. While MacArthur felt total victory was the only honorable outcome, Truman was more pessimistic about his chances once involved in a land war in Asia, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> truce and orderly withdrawal from Korea could be a valid solution. MacArthur {{was the subject of}} congressional hearings in May and June 1951, which determined that he had defied the orders of the President and thus had violated the U.S. Constitution. A popular criticism of MacArthur was that he never spent a night in Korea, and directed the war from the safety of Tokyo.|$|E
500|$|In {{the federal}} government, President Harry Truman's Executive Order 9835 {{initiated}} {{a program of}} loyalty reviews for federal employees in 1947. It called for dismissal if there were [...] "reasonable grounds... for belief that the person involved is disloyal to the Government of the United States." [...] Truman, a Democrat, was probably reacting {{in part to the}} Republican sweep in the 1946 Congressional election <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> need to counter growing criticism from conservatives and anti-communists.|$|E
500|$|On March 21, 1981, new {{president}} Ronald Reagan {{and his wife}} Nancy visited Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. for a fundraising event. Reagan recalled, [...] "I {{looked up at the}} presidential box above the stage where Abe Lincoln had been sitting the night he was shot <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> curious sensation... I thought that even with all the Secret Service protection we now had, it was probably still possible for someone who had enough determination to get close enough to the president to shoot him." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode's opening, {{featuring}} Pam Halpert (Fischer) faking {{her water}} breaking, received mixed reviews. White called the sequence her [...] "favorite part" [...] <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> empathetic {{connection to the}} character. Kratzer claimed that he enjoyed the scene. McNutt, however, wrote that the opening concludes that [...] "Pam and Jim are basically total jerks".|$|R
500|$|In November 2001, Ronald Isley {{stated that}} Aaliyah and the Isley Brothers had {{discussed}} a collaboration {{prior to her}} death. She had previously covered the Isley Brothers' single [...] "At Your Best (You Are Love)". By 2001, Aaliyah had enjoyed her now seven-year career <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> sense of accomplishment. [...] "This is what I always wanted," [...] she said of her career in Vibe magazine. [...] "I breathe to perform, to entertain, I can't imagine myself doing anything else. I'm just a really happy girl right now. I honestly love every aspect of this business. I really do. I feel very fulfilled and complete." ...|$|E
500|$|Their son, John Ten Broeck Tracy, {{was born}} in June 1924. When John was 10 months old, Louise {{discovered}} that the boy was deaf. She resisted telling Tracy for three months. Tracy was devastated by the news <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> lifelong guilt over his son's deafness. He was convinced that John's hearing impairment was a punishment for his own sins. [...] As a result, Tracy had trouble connecting with his son and distanced himself from his family. Joseph L. Mankiewicz, a friend of Tracy's, later theorized: [...] " [...] didn't leave Louise. He left the scene of his guilt." [...] A second child, Louise [...] "Susie" [...] Treadwell Tracy, {{was born in}} July 1932. The children were raised in their mother's Episcopalian faith.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} David Scarpa started writing {{a draft of}} the script in 2005, Thomas Rothman was in charge of Fox <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> {{responsibility}} to remake the film. Scarpa felt everything about the original film was still relevant, but changed the allegory from nuclear war to environmental damage because [...] "the specifics of [...] we now have the capability to destroy ourselves have changed." [...] Scarpa noted the recent events of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 informed his mindset when writing the screenplay. He scrapped Klaatu's speech {{at the conclusion of the}} story because [...] "audiences today are willing to tolerate that. People don't want to be preached to about the environment. We tried to avoid having our alien looking out over the garbage in the lake and crying a silent tear [...]" ...|$|E
5000|$|Art dolls {{production}} {{demand a}} wide range of skills and technologies, including sculpting, painting, and costuming. They are often multimedia objects made from materials such as fabric, paperclay, polymer clay, wax, wood, porcelain, natural or synthetic hair, yarn, wool, <b>and</b> <b>felt.</b> <b>As</b> works of art, art dolls can take weeks or months to finish.|$|R

60|$|The girl {{lay with}} wide-open, dark eyes, and they dilated when he knelt beside her. The flush of fever shone in her cheeks.

500|$|Henson {{was born}} in London, the fourth son and sixth child of eight of Thomas Henson (1812–1896), a businessman, and his second wife, Martha, née Fear. The family moved to Broadstairs {{on the coast of}} Kent when Henson was two years old. Thomas Henson was a zealous evangelical Christian who had renounced the Church of England and joined the Plymouth Brethren. Martha Henson {{shielded}} her children from the worst excesses of what the biographer Matthew Grimley describes as Thomas's [...] "bigotry", but in 1870 she died, and, in Henson's words, [...] "with her died our happiness". From an early age the young Henson was a dedicated Christian <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> vocation for the Anglican priesthood; his father's fundamentalist views were anathema, and left him with what Grimley calls [...] "an enduring hatred of protestant fanaticism". In 1873 Thomas Henson remarried; Emma Parker, widow of a Lutheran pastor, filled the role of stepmother with sympathy and kindness, mitigating the father's grimness and ensuring that the children were properly educated. In Henson's phrase, [...] "she recreated the home".|$|E
500|$|At 3:20p.m., the {{screwdriver}} {{slipped and}} the upper beryllium hemisphere fell, causing a [...] "prompt critical" [...] reaction and a burst of hard radiation. At the time, the scientists in the room observed the blue glow of air ionization <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> heat wave. Slotin experienced a sour taste {{in his mouth and}} an intense burning sensation in his left hand. He jerked his left hand upward, lifting the upper beryllium hemisphere and dropping it to the floor, ending the reaction. However, he had already been exposed to a lethal dose of neutron radiation. At the time of the accident, dosimetry badges were in a locked box about [...] from the accident. Realizing {{that no one in the}} room had their film badges on, [...] "immediately after the accident Dr. Slotin asked to have the badges taken from the lead box and placed on the critical assembly". This peculiar response was attributed to [...] "vertigo" [...] and was of no value for determining the actual doses received by the men in the room.|$|E
500|$|The {{position}} in the future empire of the Frisians, another Germanic people, was discussed on 5 April 1942 in one of Hitler’s many wartime dinner-conversations. Himmler commented that there was ostensibly no real sense of community between the different indigenous {{ethnic groups in the}} Netherlands. He then stated that the Dutch Frisians in particular seemed to hold no affection for being part of a nation-state based on the Dutch national identity, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> much greater sense of kinship with their German Frisian brethren across the Ems River in East Frisia, an observation Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel agreed with based on his own experiences. Hitler determined that the best course of action in that case would be to unite the two Frisian regions {{on both sides of the}} border into a single province, and would at a later point in time further discuss the topic with Arthur Seyss-Inquart, the governor of the German regime in the Netherlands. By late May of that year these discussions were apparently concluded, as on the 29th he pledged that he would not allow the West-Frisians to remain part of Holland, and that since they were [...] "part of the exact same race as the people of East Frisia" [...] had to be joined into one province.|$|E

60|$|The air {{was full}} {{of these and other}} voices as the dinghy, checking, swung. I passed one hand down Laughton's {{stretched}} arm <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> iron gooseneck <b>and</b> a foot or two of a backward-sloping torpedo-net boom. The other hand I laid on broad, cold iron--even the flanks of H.M.S. Cryptic, which is twelve thousand tons.|$|R
