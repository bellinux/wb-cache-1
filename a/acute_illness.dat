5|$|Because {{consuming}} {{too much}} sodium increases risk of cardiovascular diseases, health organizations generally recommend that people reduce their dietary intake of salt. High sodium intake {{is associated with}} a greater risk of stroke, total cardiovascular disease and kidney disease. A reduction in sodium intake by 1,000mg per day may reduce cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent. In adults and children with no <b>acute</b> <b>illness,</b> a decrease in the intake of sodium from the typical high levels reduces blood pressure. A low sodium diet results in a greater improvement in blood pressure in people with hypertension.|$|E

40|$|Background: Little {{research}} has focused on the economic hardship among the insured with severe illnesses and high treatment costs, in particular, the consequence of poorer insurance coverage for high-cost illnesses. Therefore, we presented the case for identifying the experiences of insured patients with severe chronic and <b>acute</b> <b>illnesses.</b> This study identified a qualitative understanding of the economic impact of severe chronic and <b>acute</b> <b>illnesses</b> and household strategies to deal with high treatment costs. Design: Interviews were conducted with 19 insured households of three different health insurance programs with a family member that had been hospitalized for severe chronic or <b>acute</b> <b>illnesses</b> in either Banyumas or Margono Sukarjo hospitals in Banyumas, Central Java, Indonesia. A thematic analysis was applied to guide the interpretation of the data. Results: Insured households with a family member that had been hospitalized for severe chronic and <b>acute</b> <b>illnesses</b> were greatly affected by the high treatment costs. Four major issues emerged from this qualitative study: insured patients are still burdened with high out-of-pocket payments, households adopt various strategies to cope with the high cost of treatments, households experience financial hardships, and positive and negative perceptions of the insured regarding their health insurance coverage for <b>acute</b> and chronic <b>illnesses.</b> Conclusions: 						Askes and Jamsostek patients faced financial burdens from high cost sharing for hospital amenities, non-covered drugs, and treatments and other indirect costs. Meanwhile, Jamkesmas beneficiaries faced no financial burden for related medical services but were rather burdened with indirect costs for the carers. Households relied on internal resources to cover hospital bills as the first strategy, which included the mobilization of savings, sale of assets, and borrowing of money. External support was tapped secondarily and included financial support from extended family members, donations from neighbors and the community, and additional benefits from employers. However, insured households overall had positive perceptions of insurance...|$|R
40|$|Background: Paraquat and diquat {{are among}} the most {{commonly}} used herbicides in the world. Objectives: Determine the magnitude, characteristics, and root causes for acute paraquat- and diquatrelated illnesses in the US Methods: Illnesses associated with paraquat or diquat exposure occurring from 1998 through 2011 were identified from the Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational Risks (SENSOR) -Pesticides Program, the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (CDPR) Pesticide Illness Surveillance Program (PISP), and the Incident Data System (IDS). Cases identified by the National Poison Data System (NPDS) were reviewed for the years 1998 – 2003 and 2006 – 2013. Results: A total of 300 paraquat- and 144 diquat-related <b>acute</b> <b>illnesses</b> were identified by SENSOR, PISP, and IDS. NPDS identified 693 paraquat- and 2128 diquat-related <b>acute</b> <b>illnesses.</b> In SENSOR/PISP/IDS, illnesses were commonly low severity (paraquat= 41 %; diquat= 81 %); however, SENSOR/PISP/IDS identified 24 deaths caused by paraquat and 5 deaths associated with diquat. Nineteen paraquat-related deaths were due to ingestion, seven of which were unintentional, often due to improper storage in beverage bottles. In SENSOR/PISP/IDS, paraquat and diquat-related <b>acute</b> <b>illnesses</b> were work-related in 68 % (n= 203) and 29 % (n= 42) of cases, respectively. When herbicide application site was known, the vast majority of <b>acute</b> paraquat-related <b>illnesses</b> (81 %) arose from agricultural applications. Common root causes of illness were failure to use adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), application equipment failure, and spill/splash of herbicide. Conclusions: Although the magnitude of <b>acute</b> paraquat/diquat-related <b>illnesses</b> was relatively low, several fatalities were identified. Many illnesses could be prevented through stricter compliance with label requirements (e. g. ensuring proper herbicide storage and PPE use), and through enhanced training of certified applicators...|$|R

500|$|In 1889, he {{reported}} on a case of <b>acute</b> <b>illness</b> provoked by the newly introduced hypnotic drug sulfonmethane, also known as sulfonal.

The patient's underlying condition was probably acute intermittent porphyria, which can be provoked by medicines. Similar reports by others followed shortly after, and it was soon found that other drugs could also induce porphyria attacks. The Swedish chemist Olof Hammarsten further analysed red compound found in the urine of the patients with sulfonal-related porphyria attacks, labeling it [...] "haematoporphyrin". Porphyrins were first identified by the German chemist Felix Hoppe-Seyler in 1871, and derive their named from the Greek for purple—poxphuros—after to their purple color.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Attention to {{patients}} with <b>acute</b> minor <b>illnesses</b> represents a major burden for primary care. Although programs of nurse care for children with <b>acute</b> minor <b>illnesses</b> in primary care started a long time ago, there is limited information about {{the results of these}} programs in current practice. Objectives: The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the feasibility and efficacy of a program of nurse management for unscheduled consultations of children with <b>acute</b> minor <b>illnesses.</b> Methods: Observational study of children seeking unscheduled consultations for 16 <b>acute</b> minor <b>illnesses</b> in 284 primary care practices during a 2 -year period. The program of nurse management used predefined management algorithms. Findings: Among 467, 160 consultations performed, case resolution was achieved in 65. 4 %. The remaining 34. 6 % of cases were not solved by the primary healthcare nurse due to the existence of signs of alarm and were referred to a pediatrician. Return to consultation during a 7 -day period for the same reason as the original consultation was only 2. 6 %.

Clinical Relevance: Application of programs of nurse management for unscheduled consultations for children with <b>acute</b> minor <b>illnesses</b> is feasible and effective...|$|R
40|$|<b>Acute</b> {{respiratory}} <b>illness</b> {{represents a}} large proportion of adult patients admitted to secondary care. Many of these patients have respiratory virus infection but the exact burden of disease in defined clinical groups is unknown. Rhino-enteroviruses are increasingly implicated in severe <b>acute</b> respiratory <b>illness</b> in adults and advances in molecular diagnostics have led the recognition of high strain diversity and to the discovery of a new species (HRV-C). Biomarkers such as procalcitonin and C reactive protein may be able to identify patients with <b>acute</b> respiratory <b>illness</b> without bacterial infection, in whom antibiotics can be safely withheld, and so reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing. Patients with <b>acute</b> respiratory <b>illness</b> were recruited from two acute hospital sites in Leicester between 2005 and 2008 and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and tested for the presence of respiratory viruses using a newly developed comprehensive, multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay.
