50|$|By 1974, {{exploitation}} {{films were}} losing popularity. The Single Girls (1974) attempted unsuccessfully to spoof horror genre conventions, and the ultra low-budget Have <b>a</b> <b>Nice</b> <b>Weekend</b> (1975) did not exploit the sex, nudity, drugs, or violence that audiences expected. The Love Butcher (1975), released {{at the beginning}} of the punk movement failed to attract an audience with its lack of political correctness. In The Redeemer: Son of Satan (1976), ex-students at a school reunion are stalked by a vengeful maniac because of the sins they've committed, including one woman for being a lesbian. The use of masks was a central gimmick in the poorly received Savage Weekend (1976), which was shelved for several years before a small re-release in 1981.|$|E

Only one of these {{bicycles}} was known to have made it to the BPD for testing, the rest were lost, or unaccounted for after the company went out of business. The additional Purple bicycle is a three-speed in its original Commuter Cruiser guise with White Wall tires and sprung seat. The Chicago bicycle was unfortunately ahead of its time,as many people were unwilling to spend more than $200 for what was perceived as a beach cruiser. The Chicago bicycle was much more than that, intended to become a tool to be used to get someone to work, or go for <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> ride on <b>weekends</b> on a trouble-free bicycle.|$|R

When I got back here I found a letter from you. Gee it was swell. I’ve read it about eight times already. I miss you SO much darling, and it’s only been about four hours since I last saw you. I[t] seemed funny to put you on a train for a change. Say what’s this about you losing your job? I guess since you didn’t say anything about it this weekend it’s O. K. now, n’est ce pas? Honey, try to wear your hair up next weekend, please. Then we can go to New York and be glamorous. I’ll bet you look nice when you get up in the morning. I’m serious now, no kidding. Remember this morning around six o’clock? You didn’t have any makeup on and you were very groggy and sleepy, and you had just brushed your hair—You looked wonderful. You know darling, you’re very pretty. This was <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>weekend.</b> I {{thought it was going to}} be a stinker about ten Saturday night. I was in an awful mood, honey. Whenever you see I’m in a mood like that darling, just turn your head so I can see your eyes, or smile in the wonderful way that you do, or, oh I could name a thousand other things about you that are a sure cure, things that I love, the small things that add so much to my love toward you. You know, hon, we seem to have the same moods together. That’s good. You’re just perfect, honey, too perfect to be true. But—who was it that you kissed goodnight on the first night you went out with him? Huh? We did do a lot of talking this weekend didn’t we, or at least I did. Maybe I said too much, but I believe in being frank, and not keeping anything from each other, and I know you do. I’d much rather have me tell you now about my—er—should I say escapades, than someone else later. God, I wish this war was over too, darling, I think it will take at least two years to finish this job. It’s going to be a long, tough, filthy fight, angel, but it will be worth it, for we’re fighting for freedom, this wonderful country, for people like you and your family, and our happiness. Darling, it will be worth it. And honey, you’re helping the war effort, not only by buying bonds as you do, but by the seemingly unimportant things that you do like sending packages overseas, or writing to fellas over there. Keep it up honey, and that will be your contribution, one of the best. Oh, and by the way, you do a lot to keep up the morale of one certain very important member of our Air Corps, and I don’t mean “Hap” Arnold, (or do you write to him too). By the way, I love you. And remind me to remind you to tell me how wonderful I am. Well hon, I kinda fell [sic] like it’s going to snow tomorrow, so I guess we’ll have good weather and fly all day. I’ll be thinking of you always (I like that word, now.) That would be a good song for us honey. Do you like “always”? It would be very appropriate ‘cause I know “I’ll be loving you,—always” my darling. Give my love to your mother. Did I say goodby [sic] to her today. I can’t remember. I love you darling, and miss you more than ever. Steve sends Woody his love. And I send you mine, angel. Goodnight Sweetheart. As everJudd[Transcription ends...|$|E
