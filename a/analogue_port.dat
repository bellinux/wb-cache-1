5000|$|Analogue joypad ports (2), {{with support}} for {{devices such as}} paddles and light pens in {{addition}} to joysticks/joypads. The Atari Jaguar joypads and Power Pad joypads (gray version of Jaguar joypads marketed for the STE and Falcon) can be used without an adapter. Two standard Atari-style digital joysticks could be plugged into each <b>analogue</b> <b>port</b> with an adapter.|$|E
50|$|The unit {{under the}} monitor housed a 3Â½-inch {{floppy disk drive}} and the system power supply. The {{remainder}} of the system was housed in the same unit as the keyboard, much like a conventional Master 128. The cartridge and cassette ports were removed as a space saving measure, and RS-232 hardware not populated on the circuit board as standard. A multifunction mouse and joystick port was provided as a 9-pin D type with its function configured in software. A Centronics printer interface was also provided. The 1 MHz bus and <b>analogue</b> <b>port</b> were not provided on the Compact. Additionally, no internal sockets were provided for adding a co-processor or 2nd processor. However, the machine did include a 50-way Expansion Port edge-connector {{on the right side}} of the keyboard, that carried the same signals as Cartridge Socket#3 on a Master 128.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{phone numbers}} were {{provided}} as standard. Two for the <b>analogue</b> <b>ports</b> {{and one for}} use by ISDN equipment. Home highway users were limited to these while business highway users could order Multiple Subscriber Numbering to get more phone numbers for ISDN equipment.|$|R
50|$|Although the DTS {{audio track}} is read {{at the same}} fixed bitrate as 16-bit linear PCM (1,411 kbit/s) only 14 bits (1,234 kbit/s) are used for the encoded data stream; the {{remaining}} two bits are always zeros. This {{has the effect of}} attenuating the noise that would result (by roughly 12 dB) should one attempt to play a DTS Music Disc with a non-DTS system, and thereby reducing the chance of speaker damage. However this is a non-issue for players with internal DTS decoders, such as some DVD-Audio and Blu-ray players; these devices will output a properly decoded audio signal through their <b>analogue</b> <b>ports.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{one year}} on-site {{warranty}} was indicated as {{being one of}} the best features on the desktop. Other features on the desktop included four USB 2.0 ports, a Gigabit Ethernet port, DVI, Display <b>Port,</b> and <b>analogue</b> audio <b>ports.</b>|$|R
50|$|The XS1-SU1 {{comprises}} {{a single}} core processor, a USB PHY, a switch, digital I/O <b>ports,</b> and <b>analogue</b> I/O <b>ports.</b> The execution core has a data path, a memory, and register banks for eight threads. The switches {{of two or}} more XS1-SU and Xcore XS1-L processors can be connected using one or more links, whereupon threads on all of the cores can communicate with each other by exchanging messages through the switches. The XCore XS1 instruction set architecture supports 12 general purpose registers per thread. A standard 3-operand instruction set is used for programming the thread.|$|R
