25|$|An {{everyday}} ostensive {{definition is}} embedded in a public language, and so {{in the form of}} life in which that language occurs. Participation in a public form of life enables correction to occur. That is, {{in the case of a}} public language there <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> check the use of a term that has been ostensively defined. We can justify our use of the new name T by making the ostensive definition more or less explicit.|$|E

50|$|Leaks {{are often}} {{repaired}} by plugging the leaking holes or using a patch to cover them. Leaking tires are often fixed this way. Leaking gaskets, seals, washers, or packing can be replaced. Use of welding, soldering, sealing, or gluing may <b>be</b> <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> fix leaks. Sometimes, {{the most practical}} solution is to replace the leaking unit. Leaking water heaters are often replaced by home or building owners.|$|R
50|$|Usually, {{at the end}} of 19th {{century in}} Canada, the arrival of the train and the {{construction}} of forest roads in the hinterland allowed better access to wilderness. In the 20th century, airplanes, snowmobiles and <b>other</b> all-terrain vehicles <b>were</b> <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> remote and difficult to reach water bodies. Consequently, forestry and mining, hunting, fishing, and other recreational and tourism activities (excursions, boating, vacationing...) were able to grow in these wilds.|$|R
2500|$|The age of {{an adult}} human is {{commonly}} measured in whole years since the day of birth. Fractional years, months or even weeks {{may be used to}} describe the age of children and infants for finer resolution. The time of day the birth occurred is not commonly considered. In some cultures there <b>are</b> <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> express age. For example, some cultures measure age by counting years including the current year, while others count years without including it. It could be said for the same person that he is twenty years old or that he is in the twenty-first year of his life. In Russian the former expression is generally used, the latter one has restricted usage: it is used for age of a deceased person in obituaries and for the age {{of an adult}} when it is desired to show him/her older than he/she is. (Psychologically, a woman in her 20th year seems older than one who is 19 years old.) [...] Other cultures that express age differently may not use years elapsed since birth at all. [...] Inuit culture is an example in which birthdays are not celebrated because maturity is not signified in terms of years. [...] The Navajo culture is another in which age is not counted through years elapsed from birth. [...] In this case, age is measured through certain milestones in a person's life, such as the first time they laugh.|$|E
