[...] As groups began to settle on their presidential candidate, Díaz decided {{that he was not}} going to retire but rather allow Francisco Madero, an aristocratic but democratically leaning reformer, to run against him. Although Madero, a landowner, was very similar to Díaz in his ideology, he hoped for other elites in Mexico to rule alongside the president. Ultimately, however, Díaz did not approve of Madero and had him jailed during the election in 1910. Despite what he had formerly said <b>about</b> <b>democracy</b> and change, sameness seemed to be the only reality.|$|E

2500|$|According to Miller, democracy, to Diệm, {{was rooted}} in his dual {{identity}} as Confucian and Catholic, and was associated with communitarianism and the doctrine of Personalism. He defined democracy as [...] "a social ethos based on certain sense of moral duty", not in the US sense of [...] "political right" [...] or political pluralism and {{in the context of}} an Asian country like Vietnam, Confucian values were relevant to deal with contemporary problems in politics, governance, and social change. In this sense, Diệm was not a reactionary mandarin and lacking in interest in democracy like the way he has been portrayed by some scholars. His way of thinking <b>about</b> <b>democracy</b> became key factor of his approach to political and administrative reform. On 4 March 1956, the first RVN National Assembly was held in a more free and fair than the referendum in 1955.|$|E

He found that even landless young farmworkers were soon able to obtain their own farms. Free land on the frontier therefore created opportunity and democracy, for both European immigrants as well as old stock Yankees.|$|E

2500|$|Chief Executive CY Leung {{said that}} protesters need to {{carefully}} consider {{what sort of}} democracy they are pursuing. He welcomed {{the end of the}} occupation, saying: [...] "Other than economic losses, I believe the greatest loss Hong Kong society has suffered is the damage {{to the rule of law}} by a small group of people... If we just talk <b>about</b> <b>democracy</b> without talking about the rule of law, it's not real democracy but a state of no government". Leung saw his popularity ratings slump to a new low following the occupation protests, down to 39.7 percent, with a net of minus 37%. This was attributed to public perception of Leung's unwillingness to heal the wounds, and his unwarranted shifting of the blame for the wrongs in society onto opponents. Leung also claimed negative effects on the economy without providing evidence, and his assertions were contradicted by official figures.

2500|$|In 2007, Premier Wen Jiabao had {{to answer}} a series of {{sensitive}} questions involving China's increased military spending, the road to democracy, the Dalai Lama, and even a question about disgraced former Premier Zhao Ziyang. When answering a question from a reporter from the Wall Street Journal, Wen said China would like to reduce its trade surplus, but reassured the United States that the current trade imbalance will not destabilize U.S. currency values. Wen recognized the systematic problems facing the Chinese economic system. Wen reiterated the official stance that China is opposed to the weaponization of space, and that the Chinese military build-up is purely for domestic rather than for offensive purposes. On {{the issue of the}} Dalai Lama, Wen said China's government is open to dialogue with the 14th Dalai Lama as long as he gives up efforts for Tibetan independence. In reply to a question <b>about</b> <b>democracy</b> from a French reporter, Wen reiterated the age-old CCP maxim that [...] "different states have different backgrounds, therefore democracy must be achieved based on different timelines". Wen did concede, however, that more democracy is required in the current system to combat rising corruption.|$|E

Wen remarked that [...] "someone who speaks is not a criminal, someone who listens is duly warned" [...] ( [...] , which alludes to the classical work Shi Jing) at an internal party conference in 2009, an event reported on Xinhua and other state networks. His remarks triggered debate from netizens, as it seemed to contravene the practices of the Communist Party, particularly in its suppression of dissent. Analysts noted that Wen's message was aimed at party members, and not necessarily the general public because Wen believes freedom of speech has deteriorated since Hu Jintao's accession to power and has negatively affected China's political landscape and international reputation. His comments also ostensibly addressed the pervasive [...] "fake-talking" [...] present in Chinese political circles, in an attempt to curb systemic and institutional woes stemming from officials who are afraid to speak the truth.|$|E
