[...] In June he entered a controversy when Peter Martyr, another refugee who had taken the equivalent Regius Professor position at Oxford University, debated with Catholic colleagues {{over the issue of}} the Lord's Supper. Martyr asked Bucer for his support, but Bucer did not totally agree with Martyr's position and thought that exposure of differences would not assist the cause of reform. Unwilling to see the eucharist conflict repeat itself in England, he told Martyr he did not take sides, Catholic, Lutheran, or Zwinglian. He said, [...] "We must aspire with the utmost zeal to edify as many people <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>possibly</b> can in faith and in the love of Christ—and to offend no one." ...|$|E

As Langan recalls: [...] "In those days of relatively limited technology we again had to push {{what we had to}} the limit... If, for instance, something required an effect, whether it be tape delay or phasing or some big, delayed reverb, the art was to get that effect right and record it... It all had to be done and then, as I said, it would influence the next process." [...] Langan has noted that balancing the backing vocals in the songs from the album was a major problem, due to no available terabytes of storage. He stated: [...] "We'd make it as clean <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>possibly</b> could, bounce that down to two tracks and then we'd erase." ...|$|E
500|$|On November 6, 2012, Colorado Amendment 64 (2012) {{was passed}} by initiative, thereby legalizing the {{recreational}} use of cannabis. Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper signed two bills on May 28, 2013 that made Colorado the world's first fully regulated recreational cannabis market for adults. Hickenlooper explained to the media: [...] "Certainly, this industry will create jobs. Whether it’s good for the brand of our state is still up in the air. But the voters passed Amendment 64 by a clear majority. That’s why we’re going to implement it as effectively <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>possibly</b> can." [...] In its independent analysis, the Colorado Center on Law & Policy found that the state could expect a to see [...] "$60 million in total combined savings and additional revenue for Colorado’s budget with a potential for this number to double after 2017." [...] On September 9, 2013, the Colorado Department of Revenue adopted final regulations for recreational marijuana establishments, implementing the Colorado Retail Marijuana Code (HB 13-1317). On September 16, 2013, the Denver City Council adopted an ordinance for retail marijuana establishments. The first stores officially opened on January 1, 2014. The state prepared for an influx of tourists with extra police officers posted in Denver. Safety fears led to officials seeking to limit use of the drug in popular ski resorts.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the topics}} we teach in English 10 is the ethics of scholarship. Borrowing someone’s ideas would {{necessarily}} warrant some kind of professional courtesy, {{as shown in the}} citation and proper acknowledgement of sources. While it may seem easy — something that is already a template in Microsoft Word or that would require a writer to Google “ Online Writing Lab@purdue website to find out the correct format — it is harder to unlearn a bad habit.

60|$|Or {{putting the}} thing in a {{slightly}} different phrasing, the New Republican idea amounts to this: the serious aspect of our private lives, the general aspect of all our social and co-operative undertakings, is to prepare as well <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>possibly</b> can a succeeding generation, which shall prepare still more capably for still better generations to follow. We are passing as a race out of a state of affairs when the unconscious building of the future was attained by individualistic self-seeking (altogether unenlightened or enlightened only by the indirect moralizing influence of the patriotic instinct and religion) into a clear consciousness of our co-operative share in that process. That is the essential idea my New Republic would personify and embody. In the past man was made, generation after generation, by forces beyond his knowledge and control. Now a certain number of men are coming to a provisional understanding of some at least of these forces that go to the Making of Man. To some of us there is being given the privilege and responsibility of knowledge. We may plead lack of will or lack of moral impetus, but we can no longer plead ignorance. Just as far as our light upon the general purpose goes, just so far goes our responsibility (whether we respect it or not) to shape and subdue our wills to the Making of Mankind.|$|E

40|$|The {{vision of}} the Semantic Web is to provide machineprocessable meaning for {{intelligent}} applications. Whilst knowledge representation structures like ontologies now have well-developed formalisms, the issue of determining or specifying {{exactly what it is}} that they represent is still not well-understood. However, it is crucial for validation, merging and alignment, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> cannot <b>possibly</b> hope to judge the accuracy or applicability of a representation structure without a clear specification of what it is intended to represent. This being the case, we must either accept that our representations will have a limited applicability and lifespan, or develop methods by which we can define our terms in a robust and standardized way. Building on philosopher Richard Robinson's analysis, it is argued that `definition' is in fact the isolation of territories within conceptual landscapes, using the four mechanisms: example, semantic relation, analysis, and rule. These mechanisms are related to cognitive processes like abstraction and categorization. We speculate that there is a common semantic ground which forms the initial basis for symbol grounding, and is then extended through cognitive mechanisms.

This report begins to address the background, the implications and the steps {{that will allow us to}} do better <b>as</b> <b>we</b> battle against it. The researchers in the Sinai Urban Health Institute and their colleagues who have written the papers that follow present several important findings. Notably, far too many women are dying of breast cancer, some for lack of effective treatment and some because of inadequate quality along with less than optimal frequency of mammography. It is not only that the situation is critical and needs to be improved but it is also that the racial disparities in breast cancer mortality are unacceptable and must be eliminated. So we must improve both screening and treatment. Both must be available and both must be <b>as</b> effective <b>as</b> <b>we</b> can <b>possibly</b> make them. In some cases, women cannot afford mammography. In other cases, different programs provide free mammography to those who cannot afford it but then there are no programs to provide the needed treatment if cancer is diagnosed. In still other cases, the quality of the mammogram may be inadequate. Fortunately, this latter situation can be rather well-understood due to benchmark indicators of quality established by the America...|$|R

He owned the rooms in which he lived, and the apartment in the front of the palace just above our own.
