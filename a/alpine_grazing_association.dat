40|$|Abstract : Grazing in the Australian Alps {{commenced}} in {{the early}} to mid 1800 s, but as early as the 1890 s the impact of <b>grazing</b> upon the <b>alpine</b> vegetation and soils were being reported. In the northern region of the Alps in New South Wales, grazing was gradually removed from 1954, but in the southern section in Victoria grazing continued for many years and today some grazing of high plain subalpine areas continues. <b>Alpine</b> <b>grazing</b> has been a land use of multi conflict between alpine leases, the scientific community and conservationists. While scientific evidence indicates the detrimental effects of grazing, the cultural heritage which <b>alpine</b> <b>grazing</b> holds, engenders much emotional support from the general public.

40|$|The {{influence}} of feeding practice (hay vs <b>alpine</b> <b>grazing)</b> on fatty acids profile and vitamin content of Asiago d’Allevo cheese was studied. The trial {{was carried out}} in a mountain farm located in the Plateau of 7 Comuni (1150 m a. s. l., Veneto Region, Italy) with 45 lactating cows of Rendena breed. Three cheeses were made by using milk from cows fed hay and concentrate (May, barn) and 6 with milk from cows fed grazing pasture and 3 kg (per cow and day) of concentrate (July and Sept., <b>alpine</b> <b>grazing).</b> Fatty acid composition was determined by gas-chromatography and vitamins A and E were assessed by HPLC. Data were submitted to a one-way ANOVA by using a general linear model. The <b>alpine</b> <b>grazing</b> feeding system resulted in a significantly higher polyunsaturated fatty acids content with specific regard to n- 3 group and conjugated fatty acids. The pasture-grazing thesis also significantly increased the amount of and vitamin A and E which could play a positive role as anti-oxidant protecting of double bond system of unsaturated fatty acids during ripening of chees...|$|R

40|$|Observations of {{wild boar}} damage to <b>alpine</b> <b>grazing</b> {{pastures}} in Romania’s Carpathian Mountains were collected using {{photographs of the}} slopes from vantage points. We mapped the rooted areas and then used GIS software to estimate the relative proportions of the total grazing areas visible in the photographs that were damaged by wild boar. The amounts of damage from our two demonstration pastures were 11. 2 and 13. 5 %. Pastures are rented for summer grazing with grazing density monitored. Wild boar damage essentially decreases the economic benefit received {{for the cost of}} the grazing rights. This paper appears to be the first documentation of the very direct costs to livestock owners from significant wild boar rooting within rented pastures.

40|$|Milk from <b>alpine</b> <b>grazing</b> shows a {{different}} fatty acids profile (FA) from that produced in lowlands farms. In particular, {{it seems to}} have an increased content in Mono- and Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFA and PUFA) and a better n- 6 to n- 3 ratio. Conjugated linoleic acid compounds (CLA) content also seems to be enriched. The present study aimed at evaluating the effect of <b>alpine</b> <b>grazing</b> (AG), in comparison to a Total Mixed Ration (TMR) feeding system, on fatty acids profile of milk. The study took place from May to September 2006 and involved a farm which during summer move to <b>alpine</b> <b>grazing</b> (Novegno Mountain - Vicenza, North Italy). During the lowland period (P 1, May, 25) animals were fed a TMR diet, whereas during the alpine periods (P 2, July, 18; P 3, September, 5) animals were kept at pasture and received a concentrate supplement based on maize and barley. Bulked milk samples (mix of evening and morning milking) were collected 3 times throughout one week of each experimental periods (n= 9). FA profile was assessed by gas-chromatography and the obtained data (% of the total detected FAME) were submitted to a one-way ANOVA; the 3 levels of fixed effect Period/Feeding system were used to calculate two orthogonal contrasts (P 1 vs P 2 +P 3 and P 2 vs P 3). Results showed a significant decrease of Saturated Fatty Acids (from P 1 : 62. 9 to P 3 : 56. 6 %; P< 0. 001) and an increase of MUFA (from P 1 : 25. 3 to P 3 : 31. 1; P< 0. 001) and PUFA (from P 1 : 4. 2 to P 3 : 5. 5; P< 0. 01), determining also a better n- 6 to n- 3 ratio (from P 1 : 3. 6 to P 3 : 2. 6; P< 0. 01), Thrombogenic (from P 1 : 3. 1 to P 3 : 2. 3; P< 0. 001) and Atherogenic (from P 1 : 2. 6 to P 3 : 1. 9; P< 0. 001) indexes and CLA content (from P 1 : 0. 8 to P 3 : 2. 2; P< 0. 001). For all of these variables contrast analysis showed a significant difference (P< 0, 01) between TMR (P 1) and <b>Alpine</b> <b>grazing</b> (P 2 +P 3). These results could be explained by the higher intake of unsaturated FA when cows <b>grazed</b> on <b>alpine</b> pasture. Moreover, the increase of Unsaturated Fatty Acids during P 2 and P 3 periods was probably due to the high mobilization of body fat, {{as a result of the}} deficiency in energy intake and/or of the advanced stage of lactation. In conclusion, <b>alpine</b> <b>grazing</b> seems to enhance fatty acid profile of milk, with particular regard to those fractions of interest in human nutrition...|$|R

40|$|Alpine forages {{are assumed}} to have {{specific}} effects on ruminal digestion when fed to cattle. These effects were investigated in an experiment from two perspectives, either by using such forages as a substrate for incubation or as feed for a rumen fluid donor cow. In total, six 24 -h in vitro batch culture runs were performed. Rumen fluid was collected from a non-lactating donor cow after having grazed pastures at ∼ 2000 m above sea level for 2, 6 and 10 weeks. These ‘alpine runs' were compared with three lowland samplings from before and 2 and 6 weeks after the <b>alpine</b> <b>grazing</b> where a silage-concentrate mix was fed. In each run, nine replicates of four forages each were incubated. These forages differed in type and origin (alpine hay, lowland ryegrass hay, grass-maize silage mix, pure hemicellulose) {{as well as in}} the content of nutrients. Concentrations of phenolic compounds in the incubated forages were (g/kg dry matter (DM)) : 20 (tannin proportion: 0. 47), 8 (0. 27), 15 (0. 52) and 0 (0), respectively. Crude protein was highest in the silage mix and lowest with hemicellulose, whereas the opposite was the case for fiber. The total phenol contents (g/kg DM) for the high altitude and the lowland diet of the donor cow were 27 (tannins: 0. 50 of phenols) and 12 (0. 27), respectively. Independent of the origin of the rumen fluid, the incubation with alpine hay decreased (P < 0. 05) bacterial counts, fermentation gas amount, volatile fatty acid (VFA) production as well as ammonia and methane concentrations in fermentation gas (the latter two being not lower when compared with hemicellulose). <b>Alpine</b> <b>grazing</b> of the cow in turn increased (P < 0. 001) bacterial counts and, to a lesser extent, acetate proportion compared with lowland feeding. Further, <b>alpine</b> <b>grazing</b> decreased protozoal count (P < 0. 05) and VFA production (P < 0. 001) to a small extent, whereas methane remained widely unchanged. There were interactions (P < 0. 05) between forage type incubated and feeding period of the donor cow in protozoal counts, acetate:propionate ratio, fermentation gas production and its content of methane, in vitro organic matter digestibility and metabolizable energy. Although increased phenolic compounds were the most consistent common property of the applied alpine forages, a clear attribution to certain effects was not possible in this study. As a further result, adaptation (long-term for donor cow, short term for 24 h incubations) appears to influence the expression of alpine forage effects in ruminal fermentatio...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} governments and donor {{agencies}} have devoted considerable resources to {{efforts to improve}} the management of communal grazing lands. Range and livestock projects have been designed to address such familiar pastoral problems as endemic overgrazing of rangelands, often leading to permanent degradation of vegetation, soils, and water resources, and reduced livestock productivity, adversely affecting the welfare of rural people. Whatever the complex of factors which have led to range degradation in Africa, policy-makers and project designers very often see {{at least part of the}} solution in land tenure reform. Recent range policy in Lesotho has emphasized a dual strategy. On the one hand, the strategy is to invest greater control over local management decisions in <b>grazing</b> <b>associations,</b> and on the other, to develop the institutional capacity for better adminstrative regulation of grazing, principally by reinforcing the role of the chieftainship in range management matters.
