These phosphors exhibit essentially no pressure dependence and therefore can provide an independent means for removing the temperature-dependent response of PSP’s. The major selection criteria were 1) temperature sensitivity from ambient to 300 C, 2) a short decay time (important for rapidly moving surfaces), and 3) that the material be excitable by <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> <b>light-emitting</b> diode. The mechanisms which affect the temperature dependence are discussed. For example, as temperature is increased, some phosphors show an initial decrease in decay time followed by an increase then a subsequent decrease. This is explained by a thermalization process.

In summary, the most striking temperature dependence is found in rare-earth oxysulfide hosts with either europium or terbium as the activator, but no single one of them covers the entire temperature range.

Forty disc-shaped specimens were prepared using a split polytetrafluoroethylene matrix (4. 0 mm diameter x 8. 0 mm hight) in which the materials were inserted incrementally. The curing time of each increment was of 40 s with the QTH and 10 s with the LED.

After storage in distilled water at 37 oC ± 2 oC for 24 h, the specimens was tested in compressive strength in a universal testing machine with load cell of 500 kgf running at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min. Data (in MPa) were analyzed statistically by ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls test (p 0. 05) in the compressive strength when compared to light curing with the LED source. However, light curing of the compomer with the QTH source resulted in significantly higher compressive strength than the use of the LED unit (p> 0. 05).

As a first step towards understanding the role of OPN in retinal degeneration (RD), we examined changes in OPN expression in a mouse model of RD induced by exposure to <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> <b>light-emitting</b> diode (LED). RD was induced in BALB/c mice by exposure to <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> LED (460 nm) for 2 hours. Apoptotic cell death was evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay. In order to investigate changes in OPN in RD, western blotting and immunohistochemistry were performed. Anti-OPN labeling was compared to that of anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which is a commonly used marker for retinal injury or stress including inflammation. OPN expression in RD retinas markedly increased at 24 h after exposure, was sustained through 72 h, and subsided at 120 h. Increased OPN expression was observed co-localized with microglial cells in the outer nuclear layer (ONL), outer plexiform layer (OPL), and subretinal space. Expression was restricted to the central retina in which photoreceptor cell death occurred. Interestingly, OPN expression in the ONL/OPL was closely associated with microglia, whereas most of the OPN plaques observed in the subretinal space were not. Immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated that OPN was distributed throughout the cytoplasm of microglia and in nearby fragments of degenerating photoreceptors. In addition, we found that OPN was induced more acutely and with greater region specificity than GFAP. These results indicate that OPN may be a more useful marker for retinal injury or stress, and furthermore act as a microglial pro-inflammatory mediator and a phagocytosis-inducing opsonin in the subretinal space.

No manganese oxide or nitride phase are detected after annealing in nitrogenthe 550 ℃ later. The strong blue emission peaks are observed at room temperature photoluminescence spectra of films and the luminescence mechanism of the blue is also discussed. The blue light emission(about 487 nm) is related to Zni(zinc interstice), VZn (zinc vacancy) defect levels and the corresponding blue light center which the Sb 3 + ions provides with; The blue light peak (about 436 nm) is related to Zni(zinc interstice) defect levels and the shallow donor level which VO (oxygen vacancy) forms in the Sb-doped ZnO films.

30|$|The {{assembly}} of the fusion proteins in E. coli was monitored using the fluorescence complementation assay (Gao et al. 2015). The three plasmids pET 21 a/BNMnAS, pET 28 a/BNMcAS, and pET 21 c/SspB were cotransfected into E. coli BL 21 (DE 3). After centrifugation at 8000 ×g for 10  min and resuspension of the cell pellets in 5  mL 20  mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4), 10  µM FMN was added and the cells were incubated for 10  min at 37  °C under <b>a</b> 470 -nm <b>blue</b> <b>light-emitting</b> diode array (Guntas et al. 2014). Meanwhile, an equivalent number of cells coexpressing BNMnAS, BNMcAS, and SspB in the dark, and cells coexpressing mN 159, mC 160, and SspB under 470 -nm light were used as controls and assayed in the same manner. We monitored {{the differences between the}} samples placed under the blue light and those kept in the dark by measuring epifluorescence (excitation: 562 – 640  nm, emission: 590 – 650  nm).|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This {{investigation}} {{demonstrates a}} novel light-emit-ting system with <b>an</b> array of <b>blue</b> <b>light-emitting</b> diodes (LEDs). Unlike a conventional lighting {{system that is}} constructed from white LEDs, the proposed planar lighting system uses blue LEDs to excite a YAG Ce yellow phosphor film remotely, yielding a high lumen efficiency with uniform and planar light-emission. The phosphor film herein acts as a wavelength converter and a light diffuser simultaneously. The optical properties of the pro-posed lighting system, angular color deviation and light-emitting uniformity, are studied. Eventually, a high lumen efficiency (73. 0 lm/W) and thin lighting module (7. 5 mm-thick) was demonstrated {{without the use of}} any conventional diffuser plate or light guiding plate (LGP). A low color deviation and a high light-emitting uniformity were achieved. Hence, the proposed lighting system exhibited superior optical performance using a compact module.

Processing the data with a novel evaluation procedure based on the ABC-model, we have determined the temperature-dependent IQE of the LED structure and light extraction efficiency of the LED chip. Separate evaluation of these parameters is helpful for further optimization of the heterostructure and chip designs. The data obtained enable making a guess on the temperature dependence of the radiative and Auger recombination coefficients, which may be important for identification of dominant mechanisms responsible for the efficiency droop in III-nitride LEDs. Thermal degradation of the LED performance in terms of the emission efficiency is also considered...|$|R
40|$|A {{new water}} soluble fluorene-based {{polyelectrolyte}} containing on-chain porphyrin units has been synthesized via Suzuki coupling, {{for use in}} optoelectronic devices. The material consist of a random copolymer of poly{ 1, 4 -phenylene-[9, 9 -bis(4 -phenoxy butylsulfonate) ]fluorene- 2, 7 -diyl} (PBS-PFP) and a 5, 15 -diphenylporphyrin (DPP). The energy transfer process between the PBS-PFP units and the porphyrin has been investigated through steady state and time-resolved measurements. The copolymer PBS-PFP-DPP displays two different emissions one located in the blue region of the spectra, corresponding to the fluorene part and another in the red due to fluorescent DPP units either formed directly or by exciton transfer. However, relatively inefficient energy transfer from the PFP to the on-chain porphyrin units was observed. We compare this with a system involving <b>an</b> anionic <b>blue</b> <b>light-emitting</b> donor PBS-PFP and a anionic red light-emitting energy acceptor meso-tetrakisphenylporphyrinsulfonate (TPPS), self-assembled by electrostatic attraction induced by Ca 2 +. Based on previous studies related to chain aggregation of the anionic copolymer PBS-PFP, two different solvent media were chosen to further explore the possibilities of the self-assembled system: dioxane–water and aqueous nonionic surfactant n-dodecylpentaoxyethylene glycol ether (C 12 E 5). In contrast, with the on-chain PBS-PFP-DPP system the strong overlap of the 0 - 0 emission peak of the PBS-PFP and the Soret absorption band of the TPPS results in an efficient Förster transfer. This {{is strongly dependent on}} the solvent medium used...|$|R
