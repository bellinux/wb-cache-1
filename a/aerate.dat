The test fluid used was tap water as liquid and air as gas. Based on Weibull model, the complete correlation of <b>aerated</b> power with <b>aerated</b> flow number was established through non-linear fit analysis. The effects of <b>aerated</b> rate and impeller speed on <b>aerated</b> {{power consumption}} were made an exploration. Results show that the changeable trend of the <b>aerated</b> power consumption {{is found to be}} similar under different impeller speeds and impeller diameters, i. e. the <b>aerated</b> power is close to dropping linear at the beginning of gas input, and then the drop tendency decreases as the <b>aerated</b> rate increases, at the end, the <b>aerated</b> power is a constant on the whole as the <b>aerated</b> rate reaches up the loading state. The non-linear fit curve is done using the software Origin based on the experimental data. The fairly high precision of data fit is obtained, which indicates that the mathematical model established can be used to accurately predict the <b>aerated</b> power consumption, comparatively.

25|$|The {{chisel plough}} {{is a common}} tool to get deep tillage (prepared land) with limited soil disruption. The main {{function}} of this plough is to loosen and <b>aerate</b> the soils while leaving crop residue {{at the top of}} the soil. This plough can be used to reduce the effects of compaction and to help break up ploughpan and hardpan. Unlike many other ploughs the chisel will not invert or turn the soil. This characteristic has made it a useful addition to no-till and low-till farming practices that attempt to maximise the erosion-prevention benefits of keeping organic matter and farming residues present on the soil surface through the year. Because of these attributes, the use of a chisel plough is considered by some to be more sustainable than other types of plough, such as the mouldboard plough.|$|E

Cephalopods usually live fast and die young. Most of the energy extracted from their food is used for growing, and they mature rapidly to their adult size.

25|$|An {{ice cream}} maker is a machine {{used to make}} small {{quantities}} of ice cream at home. The machine may stir the mixture by hand-cranking or with an electric motor, and may chill the ice cream by using a freezing mixture, by pre-cooling the machine in a freezer, or by the machine itself refrigerating the mixture. An ice cream maker must freeze the mixture, and must simultaneously stir or churn it to prevent the formation of ice crystals and <b>aerate</b> it to produce smooth and creamy ice cream. In 1843, New England housewife Nancy Johnson invented the hand-cranked ice cream churn. She patented her invention but lacked the resources to make and market it herself. Johnson sold the patent for $200 to a Philadelphia kitchen wholesaler who, by 1847, made enough ice cream makers to satisfy the high demand. From 1847 to 1877, more than 70 improvements to ice cream makers were patented.|$|E
25|$|Butter fills several {{roles in}} baking, {{where it is}} used {{in a similar manner}} as other solid fats like lard, suet, or shortening, but has a flavor that may better {{complement}} sweet baked goods. Many cookie doughs and some cake batters are leavened, at least in part, by creaming butter and sugar together, which introduces air bubbles into the butter. The tiny bubbles locked within the butter expand in the heat of baking and <b>aerate</b> the cookie or cake. Some cookies like shortbread may have no other source of moisture but the water in the butter. Pastries like pie dough incorporate pieces of solid fat into the dough, which become flat layers of fat when the dough is rolled out. During baking, the fat melts away, leaving a flaky texture. Butter, because of its flavor, is a common choice for the fat in such a dough, but it can be more difficult to work with than shortening because of its low melting point. Pastry makers often chill all their ingredients and utensils while working with a butter dough.|$|E
