Currently, several complementary approaches are being pursued in parallel, ranging from purely hardware based, to operating system level, and application level solutions.

Although commercial CSP provides secured data storage to the client data, it is a research challenge to satisfy the user’s requirement of confidentiality and authentication. Cloud security solutions typically have single security architecture but have many customers with different demands. Even multi-tenancy feature of cloud gives rise to security issue related to data and also the authentication of users. Though cloud service provider solves this problem by strong encryption algorithms for data security, the security achieved, works at single level. We propose a system with bi-level security mechanism which uses encryption at cloud service <b>level</b> along with <b>application</b> controller <b>level</b> <b>security</b> and system <b>level</b> <b>security</b> which provides transient user authentication with a small hardware token.

This implies providing confidentiality, data authentication, data integrity and freshness to the entire spectrum of communication between the participating nodes in a network.

Software architecture has appeared as an initial idea to develop huge, complicated and heterogeneous distributed systems successfully. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) combines services {{together to make}} systems having {{a greater impact on}} the way software systems are developed. SOA addresses the need of standards-based, loosely connected, and distributed computing which is protocol independent. It is not easy to ensure the secure transaction of data, where the movement of data occurs through loosely connected services. A number of techniques have been proposed in the contemporary literature to guide the SOA implementation in distributed system. These techniques offer certain benefits, but pose some challenges alongside {{such as the use of}} meta-data as framework and standard, contract documents, security patterns and security adviser, etc. The objective of this research is to provide a comprehensive analysis of various approaches used to provide <b>application</b> <b>level</b> <b>security</b> to the web services in SOA.

Originally, WAP was designed with a gateway in the middle, acting as the interpreter between the Internet protocol stack and the Wireless Application Protocol stack. The WAP gateway forwards web content to the mobile phone in a way intended to accommodate the limited bandwidth of the mobile network and the mobile phone’s limited processing capability. However, the gateway introduces a security hole, which renders WAP unsuitable for any security-sensitive services. Through a set of standard releases, primarily version 1. 2. 1 (June 2000) and version 2. 0 (July 2001), security issues have been addressed. We discuss the security hole and the gateway-based design that has led to it, including the business and architectural considerations underlying the design. A number of ways to correct the situation are discussed, including <b>application</b> <b>level</b> <b>security,</b> which still hasn’t been fixed in the WAP 2. 0 standard of the July 2001 release.

Information delivery made between programs through a clipboard is undoubtedly an efficient method of properly using a multitasking function of an operating system, but as the security of important data is increasingly demanded, data transmitted between independent programs through the clipboard needs to be protected. Any malicious application with get through from the protection system can easily watch the content of our clipboard and can modify the content during copy paste operation. In this paper implementation of a prototype model for clipboard security of operating system is presented, as we know that whole operating system has a common clipboard which acts as channel for inter-application operability.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a logical extension to Microsoft Business Framework (MBF) called Analytical View (AV). AV {{consists of three}} components: Model Service for design time, Business Intelligence Entity (BIE) for programming model, and IntellDrill for runtime navigation between OLTP and OLAP data sources. AV feature-set fulfills enterprise application requirements for Analysis and Decision Support, complementing the transactional feature-set currently provided by MBF. Model Service automatically transforms an "object oriented model (transactional view) " to a "multi-dimensional model (analytical view) " without the traditional Extraction/Transformation/Loading (ETL) overhead and complexity. It infers dimensionality from the object layer where richer metadata is stored, eliminating the "guesswork " that a traditional data warehousing process requires when going through physical database schema. BI Entities are classes code-generated by Model Service. As an intrinsic part of the framework, BI Entities enable a consistent object oriented way of programming model with strong types and rich semantics for OLAP, similar to what MBF object persistence technology does for OLTP data. More importantly, data contained in BI Entities have {{a higher degree of}} "application awareness, " such as the integrated <b>application</b> <b>level</b> <b>security</b> and customizability.

They are the structuring principle of a multitude of applications and the enabling technology for recent software paradigms like Mashup or SaaS. Assessing the trustworthiness of such complex and continuously evolving systems is a challenging task since a) methodologies - mainly based on certification processes - developed for assessing conventional static systems can hardly handle the dynamicity and variety of SOA based systems, b) few artifacts {{can be used to}} support and automate the assessment of the trustworthiness of a stand-alone service, and no means exist to assess the trustworthiness of composite applications, c) there is no mechanism to express and confront claimed security properties.

Unfortunately, WSNs are exposed to numerous security threats that can adversely a#ect the success of important applications.

Instead, we propose that an e#ective solution for WSNs must be sensitive to the application and infrastructure.

The vulnerability is a function of factors such as the sensor field, the WSN infrastructure, the application, protocols and system software, as well the accessibility and the observability of the WSN.

This is especially significant {{after the end of}} cold war, emergence of multi-polarity and proliferation of global terrorism. However, there is no established concept of human security in mainstream social science debates across the world. In the absence of a theory of human security, there exist few quantitative indicators and hence few data base on human security. More recently political theorists tried to develop a concept of human security based on the concept of human development and human rights. Yet, social science theory has not yet come forward with a comprehensive view of what exactly constitute human security. The matter is further complicated by the process of globalization and the high social costs associated with it. Against this context, this article attempts to analyze the concept of human security and its implication in a global context threatened by multiple forces of fear and insecurity.
