25|$|Two {{alternative}} size-selective criteria, {{often used}} in atmospheric monitoring, are PM10 and PM2.5. PM10 is defined by ISO as particles which pass through a size-selective inlet with a 50% efficiency cut-off at 10 μm <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> and PM2.5 as particles which pass through a size-selective inlet with a 50% efficiency cut-off at 2.5 μm <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter.</b> PM10 corresponds to the “thoracic convention” as defined in ISO 7708:1995, Clause 6; PM2.5 corresponds to the “high-risk respirable convention” as defined in ISO 7708:1995, 7.1. The United States Environmental Protection Agency replaced the older standards for particulate matter based on Total Suspended Particulate with another standard based on PM10 in 1987 and then introduced standards for PM2.5 (also known as fine particulate matter) in 1997.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe CIP 10 -M {{personal}} sampler measures {{worker exposure}} to airborne particles by collecting particles in a rotating metal cup containing a few milliliters {{of a collection}} fluid. This device is mainly used to sample microorganisms or microbial components to measure bioaerosol concentrations in various occupational environments. Aqueous liquids are generally used, but their rapid evaporation limits the duration of sampling; alternative collection fluids could alleviate this problem. Indeed, the particle-collection efficiency of the rotating cup has not been extensively studied, and the only data available relate to a discontinued model. This study aimed to measure the collection efficiency of the current rotating cup model containing an aqueous (water) or viscous (ViaTrap mineral oil) collection fluid. The kinetics of evaporation confirmed that ViaTrap does not evaporate, making 8 -h sampling campaigns in constant volumes feasible. Particles {{with a wide range}} of <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameters</b> (between around 0. 1 and 10 µm) were produced using various test rigs and mono- or polydisperse test aerosols. Both new and older cup models performed similarly, with a collection efficiency of > 80 % for larger particles (<b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameters</b> > 2. 8 µm), progressively decreasing to around 50 % for <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameters</b> of 2. 1 µm; with <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameters</b> of < 1 µm, the collection efficiency was generally < 10 %. In physical terms, collection efficiency was unaffected by the type (aqueous or viscous) or volume (between 0 and 3 mL) of collection fluid used. Bias maps indicated that the inhalable fraction may be underestimated in occupational settings, particularly with aerosols mainly composed of particles with <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameters</b> of less than around 3 µm...|$|R
25|$|Another {{method used}} to assess the amount and effects of water {{pollutants}} is to measure the amount of PM2.5 in rainfall. Measuring PM2.5 (the amount of <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter</b> of particle≤2.5 μm in a given amount of air) is a common metric for assessing air quality. Comparing PM2.5 levels between air and rainfall samples allows scientists to determine the amount of air pollution being transferred to water sources. Pollutants in rainfall quickly and directly affect pollution in groundwater sources. In 2013, researchers in Beijing found a significant relationship between the amount of PM2.5 concentrations in the air and in rainfall. Studies showed that rainfall had a significant “washing” effect on PM2.5 in the air, transferring a large portion of these pollutants from the air to water sources. In this way, Beijing’s notorious air pollution has a direct and significant impact on rainfall, and therefore, on water resources throughout the region.|$|E
25|$|Particles can deposit in the nose, mouth, pharynx and larynx (the head airways region), deeper {{within the}} {{respiratory}} tract (from the trachea {{to the terminal}} bronchioles), or in the alveolar region. The location of deposition of aerosol particles within the respiratory system strongly determines {{the health effects of}} exposure to such aerosols. This phenomenon led people to invent aerosol samplers that select a subset of the aerosol particles that reach certain parts of the respiratory system. Examples of these subsets of the particle-size distribution of an aerosol, important in occupational health, include the inhalable, thoracic, and respirable fractions. The fraction that can enter each part of the respiratory system depends on the deposition of particles in the upper parts of the airway. The inhalable fraction of particles, defined as the proportion of particles originally in the air that can enter the nose or mouth, depends on external wind speed and direction and on the particle-size distribution by <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameter.</b> The thoracic fraction is the proportion of the particles in ambient aerosol that can reach the thorax or chest region. The respirable fraction is the proportion of particles in the air that can reach the alveolar region. To measure the respirable fraction of particles in air, a pre-collector is used with a sampling filter. The pre-collector excludes particles as the airways remove particles from inhaled air. The sampling filter collects the particles for measurement. It is common to use cyclonic separation for the pre-collector, but other techniques include impactors, horizontal elutriators, and large pore membrane filters.|$|E

40|$|Deposition of {{particles}} in rat airways {{was measured using}} two methods. In method 1, a controlled flow of monodisperse particles was passed directly through the nasal airways of an anesthetized rat and nasal deposition efficiency was determined for particles with <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameters</b> between 0. 5 and 4 µm. In method 2, upper respiratory tract (URT) and lung depos-ition fractions for unanesthetized rats exposed to radiolabeled particles in head-only units and anesthetized rats exposed in whole-body units were determined for particles with <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameters</b> between 0. 9 and 3 µm. Animal breathing parameters were measured for method 2 exposures. Nasal deposition efficiency was greater for pulsatile flows than steady state (method 1). Nasal deposition was distinctly higher for method 1 exposures than those using method 2 because particles were 100 % inhalable in method 1 and < 100 % inhalable in the head-only and whole body exposures of method 2. Similarly, deposition was greater in head-only than whole-body exposures because particle inhalability was greater in head-only exposures...|$|R

2500|$|Cities {{hosting the}} Olympic Games have two primary concerns: traffic {{congestion}} and air pollution, {{both of which}} can result in compromised air quality during and after Olympic venue construction.

Black Carbon is released into the air from incomplete combustion of carbonaceous fluids contributing to global climate change and human health effects. The black carbon concentrations are highly impacted by the truck traffic due to the traffic congestion during the massive construction.

50|$|Certain {{limitations}} {{exist for}} commonly used bioaerosol samplers. For {{most of the}} samplers, nonbiological environmental particles such as dust must be separated from bioaerosols prior to detection. The diluted nature of bioaerosol in the air also poses challenges to samplers. While total microorganism concentrations are {{on the order of}} 106/cm3 or greater, bioaerosol concentrations are commonly less than 1/cm3, and often less than 1/m3 in the case of infectious aerosols. Moreover, many commercially available bioaerosol samplers haven not been investigated on their collection efficiencies for particles with different <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>diameters,</b> which makes it impossible to get the size-resolved bioaerosol information.|$|R
