5|$|In Vijayanagara, Madhura was {{the court}} poet of King HariharaII and King Deva RayaI under the {{patronage}} {{of their respective}} prime ministers. He is famous for {{his account of the}} 15th tirthankar titled Dharmanatha Purana (1385), written in a style similar to that of Jain poets of earlier centuries. Madhura is also credited with <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> <b>about</b> Gomateshwara of Shravanabelagola. Ayata Varma, who is tentatively dated to 1400, translated from Sanskrit a champu (mixed prose-verse) titled Ratna Karandaka describing Jain ideologies.

5|$|On {{the day of}} Germanicus' death {{his sister}} Livilla gave birth to twins by Drusus. The oldest was named Germanicus and died young. In 37, Germanicus' only {{remaining}} son Caligula became emperor and renamed September Germanicus {{in honor of his}} father. Many Romans, in the account of Tacitus, considered Germanicus to be their equivalent to King Alexander the Great, and believed that he would have easily surpassed the achievements of Alexander had he become emperor. In book eight of his Natural History, Pliny connects Germanicus, Augustus, and Alexander as fellow equestrians: when Alexander's horse Bucephalus died he named a city Bucephalia in his honor. Less monumental, Augustus' horse received a funeral mound, which Germanicus wrote <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> <b>about.</b>|$|E
5|$|Oscar Hornung left Eton College in 1914, {{intending}} to enter King's College, Cambridge later that year. When Britain entered {{the war against}} Germany, he volunteered, and was commissioned into the Essex Regiment. He was killed at the Second Battle of Ypres on 6 July 1915, aged 20. Although heartbroken by the loss, Hornung was adamant that some good would come of it and he edited a privately issued collection of Oscar's letters home under the title Trusty and Well Beloved, released in 1916. Around this time he joined an anti-aircraft unit. In either 1916 or 1917 he joined the YMCA and did volunteer work in England for soldiers on leave; in March 1917 he visited France, writing <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> <b>about</b> his experience afterwards—something {{he had been doing}} more frequently since Oscar's death—and a collection of his war poetry, Ballad of Ensign Joy, was published later that year.|$|E
