25|$|The dialogue, {{somewhat}} unusually, {{does not}} set {{itself as a}} re-telling of the day's events. The dialogue is given unmediated, in the direct words of Socrates and Phaedrus, without other interlocutors to introduce the story or give it to us; it comes first hand, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> witnessing the events themselves. This {{is in contrast to}} such dialogues as the Symposium, in which Plato sets up multiple layers between the day's events and our hearing of it, explicitly giving us an incomplete, fifth-hand account.|$|E
2500|$|A {{spokesman}} for the Irish Embassy in London recently said, [...] "The British Isles has a dated ring to it, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> still part of the Empire. We are independent, we {{are not part of}} Britain, not even in geographical terms. We would discourage its usage [...]".|$|E
2500|$|In April 2006, {{asked whether}} {{negotiations}} with Russians are possible, the top separatist commander Doku Umarov answered: [...] "We offered them many times. But {{it turned out}} that we constantly press for negotiations and it's <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> always standing with an extended hand and this is taken as a sign of our weakness. Therefore we don't plan to do this any more." [...] In the same month, the new separatist spokesman Movladi Udugov said that attacks should be expected anywhere in Russia: [...] "Today, we have a different task on our hands – total war, war everywhere our enemy can be reached. (...) And this means mounting attacks at any place, not just in the Caucasus but in all Russia." [...] Reflecting growing radicalization of the Chechen-led militants, Udugov said their goal was no longer Western-style democracy and independence, but the Islamist [...] "North Caucasian Emirate".|$|E

60|$|MRS. CAROLINE. The Ideal Man! Oh, the Ideal Man {{should talk}} to us <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> goddesses, and treat us <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> children. He should refuse all our serious requests, and gratify {{every one of our}} whims. He should {{encourage}} us to have caprices, and forbid us to have missions. He should always say much more than he means, and always mean much more than he says.|$|R

60|$|Upstairs, {{the quality}} has paid its visits and shaken hands: the Syndaco and the well-to-do half-Austrian {{owners of the}} woodyard, the Bertolini, have ostentatiously shown their mutual friendship; our padrone, the Signer Pietro Di Paoli, has visited his {{relatives}} the Graziani in the box next the stage and has spent two intervals {{with us in our}} box; meanwhile, his two peasants standing down below, pathetic, thin contadini of the old school, like worn stones, have looked up at us <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> the angels in heaven, with a reverential, devotional eye, they themselves far away below, standing in the bay at the back, below all.|$|E

50|$|Connectivism {{proposes that}} the {{knowledge}} we can access by virtue of our connections with others is just as valuable as the information carried inside our minds. The learning process, therefore, is not entirely under an individual’s control—learning can happen outside ourselves, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{a member of a}} large organization where many people are continuously updating a shared database.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first step}} of {{constructing}} the tables consists of determining the transitions between the closed item sets. These transitions will be determined <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> considering a finite automaton that can read terminals as well as nonterminals.

5000|$|A critic from The Hindu noted [...] "at a {{time when}} much-hyped, hero-backed films end up being mere dampeners, a low-key film like this comes with no unsavoury {{loudness}} or lewdness, {{is at least a}} decent offering." [...] Another critic noted [...] "the story has predictable turnings. At times it appears <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> watching an old film." [...] The film's low-key release meant that the film went unnoticed at the box office.|$|E

50|$|In {{parallel}} with those Parent recordings, the Child is a simultaneous recording of internal events — how life felt as a child. Harris equates these with the vivid recordings that Wilder Penfield {{was able to}} cause his patients to re-live by stimulating their brains. Harris proposes that, as adults, when we feel discouraged, it is <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> re-living those Child memories yet the stimulus for re-living them {{may no longer be}} relevant or helpful in our lives.|$|E

50|$|Tragedy - {{construed}} as an ethical construct - {{plays an important}} part in the awareness of metaphysical realism. MacKinnon illustrates this with examples of tragedy from Shakespeare, Greek thought, and Jesus’ parables, and concludes that ‘it is <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> constrained in pondering the extremities of human life to acknowledge the transcendent as the only alternative to the kind of trivialisation which would empty of significance the sorts of tragic experience with which we have been concerned’.|$|E

50|$|The Helix Nebula is {{an example}} of a {{planetary}} nebula, formed by an intermediate to low-mass star, which sheds its outer layers near the end of its evolution. Gases from the star in the surrounding space appear, from our vantage point, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> looking down a helix structure. The remnant central stellar core, known as a planetary nebula nucleus or PNN, is destined to become a white dwarf star. The observed glow of the central star is so energetic that it causes the previously expelled gases to brightly fluoresce.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sound is}} psychedelic, churning, {{hypnotic}} — {{not at all}} frenetic or purely electronic. Metallic klangs glide over a slowed-down afro-percussion track. A train noise over a beat is mixed continuously with a funky guitar riff {{and then with a}} synthesizer composition (Jean-Michel Jarre?). Flangers and equalizer effects are applied, not like the overexcited tantrums of a modern DJ, but rather methodically and with deep feeling, changing the texture of entire passages, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> gently passing from a radio show through a train tunnel back to a great concert hall.
