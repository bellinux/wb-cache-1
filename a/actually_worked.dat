5|$|Rite of Memphis-Misraïm Proceeding from Cagliostro's rite, the Rite of Misraïm (from Arabic مصر Miṣr = Egypt) {{continued}} {{as a form}} of mixed, esoteric masonry. Banned in 1817, it was reformulated as the Rite of Memphis in 1838, and in spite of fluctuating fortunes in its French home, began to spread internationally {{during the second half of}} the nineteenth century. During the 1880s the two rites were fused by Giuseppe Garibaldi into the Rite of Memphis-Misraïm. The modern order now boasts up to 99 degrees, not all of which <b>actually</b> <b>worked.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1940, Hanna and Barbera jointly {{directed}} Puss Gets the Boot, {{which was}} nominated for an Academy Award for Best (Cartoon) Short Subject. The studio wanted a diversified cartoon portfolio, so despite the success of Puss Gets the Boot, Barbera and Hanna's supervisor, Fred Quimby, {{did not want to}} produce more cat and mouse cartoons believing that there were already enough cartoons of those in existence. Surprised by the success of Puss Gets the Boot, Barbera and Hanna ignored Quimby's resistance and continued developing the cat-and-mouse theme. By this time, however, Hanna wanted to return to working for Ising, to whom he felt very loyal. Barbera and Hanna met with Quimby, who discovered that although Ising had taken sole credit for producing Puss Gets the Boot, he never <b>actually</b> <b>worked</b> on it. Quimby then gave Hanna and Barbera permission to pursue their cat-and-mouse idea. The result was their most famous creation, Tom and Jerry.|$|E

5|$|Maria Deraismes was {{initiated}} into Freemasonry in 1882, then resigned {{to allow her}} lodge to rejoin their Grand Lodge. Having failed to achieve acceptance from any masonic governing body, she and Georges Martin started a mixed masonic lodge that <b>actually</b> <b>worked</b> masonic ritual. Annie Besant spread the phenomenon to the English speaking world. Disagreements over ritual {{led to the formation}} of exclusively female bodies of Freemasons in England, which spread to other countries. Meanwhile, the French had re-invented Adoption as an all-female lodge in 1901, only to cast it aside again in 1935. The lodges, however, continued to meet, which gave rise, in 1959, to a body of women practising continental Freemasonry.|$|E
5|$|The 1990 {{season and}} Super Bowl win {{marked the end}} of an era for the Giants. Shortly after the win, {{defensive}} coordinator Bill Belichick left to become head coach of the Cleveland Browns, and Parcells decided in the spring of 1991 to leave the Giants for a career in broadcasting. There was also an ownership change in what had been one of the most stable front offices in professional sports. In February 1991, after being diagnosed with Cancer, Tim Mara sold his 50% interest in the team to Bob Tisch for a reported $80 million. The sale was <b>actually</b> <b>worked</b> out before the Super Bowl but not announced until afterwards, so as to avoid distracting the team. It marked the first time since their inception in 1925 that the Giants had not been wholly owned and controlled by the Mara family.|$|E

25|$|In {{developing}} the common law, academic writings have always {{played an important}} part, both to collect overarching principles from dispersed case law, and to argue for change. William Blackstone, from around 1760, was the first scholar to collect, describe, and teach the common law.

25|$|The War Office {{contacted}} Matthews in February 1924 {{to request}} a demonstration of his ray. Matthews did not reply to them but spoke to journalists and demonstrated the ray to a Star reporter by igniting gunpowder from a distance.

25|$|During {{the height}} of the lumber {{industry}} in Lycoming County, 1861–1891, the various mills produced 5.5 billion board feet (13 million m³) of lumber.

25|$|Next, Matthews {{appeared}} in public in 1921 and {{claimed to have}} invented the world's first talking picture, a farewell interview of Ernest Shackleton recorded on 16 September 1921, shortly before Shakleton's last expedition. The film was not commercially successful. Other talking-picture processes had been developed before that of Matthews, including processes by William K. L. Dickson, Photokinema (Orlando Kellum), and Phonofilm (Lee DeForest). However, Matthews claimed his process was the first sound-on-film process. Even if Matthews's process <b>actually</b> <b>worked,</b> it was certainly not the first.|$|E
25|$|In a {{test run}} of VIN 530 at Bridgehampton Raceway in 1981, the twin turbo DeLorean was quicker than a Ferrari 308 and a Porsche 928. It {{has been a}} {{misconception}} for many years VIN 502 was at Bridgehampton and used in testing; however, evidence from pictures, along with information via a Legend employee published via PJ Grady, proves 530 was used with the aspirated VIN 558. By the time of Bridgehampton, Legend had perfected modular boosting which the earlier prototypes did not have installed apart {{from one of the}} Alpine mules and VIN 530. This has also been proven by a Legend Engineer who <b>actually</b> <b>worked</b> on the cars.|$|E
25|$|The army {{landing force}} under Granger {{was ready to}} launch the attack on August 3, but Farragut wanted to wait for his fourth monitor USS Tecumseh, {{expected}} at any moment but delayed at Pensacola. The admiral almost decided to proceed with only three monitors, and the army went ashore on Dauphin Island, acting under a misapprehension of naval intentions. The fleet {{was not ready to}} move yet, so the defenders were able to rush additional forces to Fort Gaines. After the battle, Farragut concluded that the delay had <b>actually</b> <b>worked</b> to the advantage of the Federal forces, as the reinforcements were not great enough to have any effect on the battle, but they were included in the surrender.|$|E
