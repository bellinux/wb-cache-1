40|$|Intravascular volumes were {{sequentially}} {{determined in}} 13 African children recovering from protein-caloric malnutrition. The red cell volume {{was measured by}} a radiochromium technique; the total blood volume and the plasma volume were calculated. The <b>absolute</b> <b>volumes</b> were related to body size and were compared with control values. Before treatment, the total blood volume was low per unit of body size, the red cell volume was more reduced than the plasma volume. On the 20 th realimentation day, the <b>absolute</b> red cell <b>volume</b> had increased less than the <b>absolute</b> plasma <b>volume,</b> and the total blood volume was almost normal per unit of body size. On the 60 th realimentation day, near recovery, the <b>absolute</b> red cell <b>volume</b> had again increased, but again less than the <b>absolute</b> plasma <b>volume,</b> and the venous hematocrit was lower than on admission; the total blood volume was normalized per unit of body size, the red cell volume was low with a supranormal plasma volume. The rehabilitation period was characterized by an aggravation of the hemodilution already present before treatment. The significance {{of the changes in}} volemia per unit of body size was unclear because of the changing body composition. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

50|$|The {{cumulative}} DVH is plotted with bin doses {{along the}} horizontal axis, as well. However, the column {{height of the}} first bin (0-1 Gy, e.g.) represents the volume of structure receiving {{greater than or equal}} to that dose. The column height of the second bin (1.001-2.000 Gy, e.g.) represents the volume of structure receiving {{greater than or equal to}} that dose, etc. With very fine (small) bin sizes, the cumulative DVH takes on the appearance of a smooth line graph. The lines always slope and start from top-left to bottom-right. For a structure receiving a very homogenous dose (100% of the volume receiving exactly 10 Gy, for example) the cumulative DVH will appear as a horizontal line at the top of the graph, at 100% volume as plotted vertically, with a vertical drop at 10 Gy on the horizontal axis. A DVH used clinically usually includes all structures and targets of interest in the radiotherapy plan, each line plotted a different color, representing a different structure.

50|$|The most {{commonly}} used indicator to measure NRW is the percentage of NRW {{as a share of}} water produced. While this indicator is easy to understand and indeed has been widely used, it has increasingly been recognized that it is not an appropriate indicator to benchmark NRW levels between utilities or even to monitor changes over time. When losses in terms of <b>absolute</b> <b>volume</b> are constant the percentage of NRW varies greatly with total water use, i.e. if water use increases and the volume of losses remains constant the percentage of NRW declines. This problem can be eliminated by measuring NRW not as a share, but in terms of absolute losses per connection per day, as recommended by the International Water Association (IWA). Nevertheless, the use of percentage figures to compare levels of NRW remains common despite its shortcomings. The International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation recommends to use different indicators (percentage, losses per connection or losses per km of network) together. Losses per kilometer of network are more appropriate to benchmark real losses, while losses per connection are more appropriate to benchmark apparent losses.|$|E

Metods The research was performed on 60 human placentas of term pregnancy: 30 placentas of pregnant women of age 20 - 34 (control group), and 30 placentas of pregnant women of age 35 and older (experimental group). Stereological analysis was performed on multipurpose testing system M 42 with 40 times objective magnification. Results Average volume density of syncytiotrophoblast in resorption villi of experimental and control group was Vvss = (0, 489 ± 0, 032) mm 0 and Vvsm = (0, 389 ± 0, 078) mm 0, respectively. Statistical analysis of results using Student t-test indicated a significantly higher volume density of syncytiotrophoblast of resorption villi in the experimental than {{in the control group}} (p< 0, 001). <b>Absolute</b> <b>volume</b> of syncytiotrophoblast in resorption villi of the experimental and control groups was Vss =(205, 250 ± 40, 894) cm 3 and Vsm = (178, 386 ± 44, 413) cm 3, respectively.

40|$|Structural {{changes in}} the rat {{placenta}} during {{the last third of}} gestation were for the first time assessed by stereology. Fischer female rats were euthanized on the day 16 or day 19 of gestation, and 35 placentas were collected. Three randomly selected placentas from each group were stereologically analyzed for the <b>absolute</b> <b>volume.</b> The proportion of the glycogenic cells and the trophoblast giant cells (TGC) in the basal part of the placenta was calculated using volume density.  The <b>absolute</b> <b>volume</b> of the rat placenta on the day 16 of gestation was determined as 0. 0638 cm 3. The labyrinth comprised 0. 0274 cm 3, the basal plate 0. 0271 cm 3 and the decidua 0. 0093 cm 3. On the day 19 of gestation, the <b>absolute</b> <b>volume</b> of the placenta was 0. 1627 cm 3, the labyrinth occupied 0. 0922 cm 3, the basal plate 0. 0596 cm 3 and the decidua 0. 0109 cm 3. The volume density of trophoblast giant cells was 0. 174 cm 0 on the day 16 and 0. 107 cm 0 on the day 19 of gestation. The glycogenic cells comprised 0. 379 percentage of the basal plate on the day 16 and 0. 236 on the day 19 of gestation. We conclude that the <b>absolute</b> <b>volume</b> of the whole placenta and the labyrinth has increased from day 16 to the day 19 of gestation. In contrast, the volume density of glycogenic cells and trophoblast giant cells was higher on the day 16 than on the day 19 of gestation, probably due to the intensive trophoblast invasion during that time. </p...|$|E

40|$|The present work is {{directed}} to the measurement of the <b>absolute</b> <b>volume</b> of secreted acid in the stomach using 6 -electrode FIM. Stomach acid {{is important because it}} has diagnostic applications in diarrhoeal diseases and in anaemia. Through a simplified resistance model this work has predicted that the variation in (Ze−Zs) /Ze with volume of liquid in stomach should be much greater than that of Zs/Ze. The simple resistance model has also predicted that the normalised change in measured transfer impedance (Ze−Zs) /Ze will be proportional to the volume of liquid in the stomach provided the resistivity of the liquid and the depth of stomach from the frontal skin surface is constant. Both these have been verified through real life measurement on two human subjects. This means that the measured transfer impedance change can indeed be related to the volume of saline in stomach. Together with depth information obtained using anatomical markers, {{it may be possible to}} obtain the <b>absolute</b> <b>volume</b> using FIM non-invasively...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cathodoluminescence {{petrography}} and scanning {{electron microscopy}} (SEM) reveal that grain size and temperature significantly influenced intergranular pressure solution, quartz cementation, and porosity evolution in the quartzose Hartshorne Sandstone (Middle Pennsylvanian) of the Arkoma basin. Among samples from each locality, a negative, linear relationship exists between mean grain size and volume of quartz dissolved by intergranular pressure solution. In contrast, agenerally positive relationship exists between mean grain size and volume of quartz cement, although considerable variability exists in this relationship. A positive relationship also exists between mean grain size and porosity. Intergranular pressure solution directly reduced minus-cement porosity by causing tighter packing of detrital grains; it thereby controlled volumes of both cement and primary porosity. For this reason, little primary porosity is preserved in pressolved, finer-grained sandstones even though they contain small <b>absolute</b> <b>volumes</b> of quartz cement. Appreciably more primary porosity may be retained by unpressolved, coarser-grained sandstones ven though they contain larger <b>absolute</b> <b>volumes</b> of quartz cement. These relationships also vary with thermal maturity, which increases eastward across the basin.

Volume density and <b>absolute</b> <b>volume</b> of the epithelium, lumen, smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and nonmuscular stroma were determined by stereology and paired with plasma testosterone levels and different morphometric measurements. The VP shows an initial growth within the first 3 weeks, a resting phase, and the puberal growth. The puberal growth was coincident with the raise in plasma testosterone. Lumen formation occurred within the 3 postnatal weeks. After an expected increase during puberty, the lumen showed a further increase at the 12 th week. The volume density of the nonmuscular stroma and of the SMCs decreased slowly postnatally. <b>Absolute</b> <b>volume</b> of the luminal compartment showed three phases of growth (weeks 1 - 3, 6 - 9, and 11 - 12). on the other hand, {{the increase in the}} <b>absolute</b> <b>volume</b> of the epithelium was steady up to the 8 th week and then showed a marked increase up the 10 th week. The increase in epithelial volume was characterized morphologically by the presence of epithelial infoldings and sprouts. The growth of the epithelium showed a 2 -week delay as compared to the lumen and occurred only until the 10 th week. The epithelial height was variable but could be related to the synthetic activity of the epithelium.

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} both the early biological response and the mechanical properties of a porous hydroxyapatite bone graft substitute are highly sensitive to its pore structure. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate whether the pore structure continued to influence bone integration in the medium to long term. Two screened batches of porous hydroxyapatite (PHA) designated as batch A and batch B, with porosities of 60 and 80 %, respectively, were selected for this study and implanted for periods of 5, 13, and 26 weeks into the lower femur of New Zealand White rabbits. Histomorphometric analysis of the <b>absolute</b> <b>volume</b> of bone ingrowth within batch A and B implants from 5 to 26 weeks showed that the <b>absolute</b> <b>volume</b> of bone ingrowth was consistently lower in batch A (10 - 21 %), compared to batch B implants (24 - 31 %). However, when the volume of bone ingrowth was normalised for the available pore space, this difference was reduced (23 - 47 % and 32 - 42 % for batches A and B, respectively). These observations suggest that differences in the volume of bone ingrowth initially depended on pore interconnectivity rather than pore size, whereas the volume or morphology of the PHA influenced the volume and morphology of bone ingrowth at later time points. Compression testing showed that bone ingrowth had a strong reinforcing effect on PHA bone graft substitutes, and a strong correlation was identified between mechanical properties and the <b>absolute</b> <b>volume</b> of ingrowth for both batches A and B. Furthermore, at 13 and 26 weeks, there was no significant variation in the ultimate compressive strength of integrated batch A and B implants. This similarity in ultimate mechanical properties indicated that the <b>absolute</b> <b>volume</b> of ingrowth may be mediated by the PHA structure through its impact on the dynamics of the local biomechanical environment. The results of push-out testing showed that fixation of PHA bone graft substitutes was independent of density within the range studied, with no significant difference in the interfacial shear stress between batches A and B at each time point throughout the study...|$|E

It is shown that weak property rights in Zimbabwe lead to an increase in South Africa's foreign direct investment (FDI), but a reduction in South Africa's portfolio investment. This suggests that Zimbabwe and South Africa compete for foreign direct investment in similar sectors, and present two alternative investment destinations to foreign investors. As such, when property rights in Zimbabwe worsen, FDI appears to switch to South Africa as an alternative.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} correlations between sleep apnea severity and tongue volume or posterior airway space measured via three-dimensional reconstruction of volumetric computerized tomography (CT) images in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) for use in predicting OSA severity and in surgical treatment. We also assessed associations between tongue volume and Mallampati score. Snoring/OSA male patients (n = 64) who underwent polysomnography, cephalometry, and CT scans were enrolled in this retrospective study. OSA was diagnosed when the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was greater than 5 (mild 5 - 14; moderate 15 - 29; severe> 30). The patients were also categorized into the normal-mild group (n = 22) and the moderate-severe group (n = 42). Using volumetric CT images with the three-dimensional reconstruction technique, the volume of the tongue, posterior airway space volume, and intra-mandibular space were measured. The volumes, polysomnographic parameters, and physical examination findings were compared, and independent factors that are related to OSA were analysed. No associations between tongue volume or posterior airway space and the AHI were observed. However, multivariate linear analyses showed that tongue volume had significantly negative association with lowest O 2 saturation (r = 0. 365, p = 0. 027). High BMI was related to an increase in tongue volume.
