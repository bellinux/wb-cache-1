5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>thing</b> in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E
500|$|Originally, the game's protagonists Juno and Vela were {{designed}} as {{younger and more}} cartoon-like with large heads, but were ultimately changed to a more mature version at Nintendo's request. The game's controls {{were one of the}} main concerns during development. The idea was to retain a character-based game, where players could see the character they were playing, while keeping the tightness and accuracy of first-person shooters. Rare initially attempted to automate the change of view and targeting mode based on the context of the action, but this idea was eventually replaced with a manual system. According to Mountain, [...] "The solution we ended with is <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>thing.</b> It feels very old-school to me; difficult, unforgiving, but ultimately precise." ...|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{occasionally}} {{changed his}} hair and lost or gained weight for parts, {{and he went to}} great lengths to reveal the worst in his characters. But in a 2012 interview he confessed that performing to a high standard was a challenge: [...] "The job isn't difficult. Doing it well is difficult." [...] In an earlier interview with The New York Times, he explained how deeply he loved acting but added, [...] "that deep kind of love comes at a price: for me, acting is torturous, and it's torturous because you know it's <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>thing...</b> Wanting it is easy, but trying to be great– well, that's absolutely torturous." [...] This struggle was confirmed by the author John le Carré, who met Hoffman during the adaptation of his novel A Most Wanted Man. While praising the actor's intelligence and intuition, le Carré acknowledged the burden that Hoffman felt: [...] "It was painful and exhausting work, and probably in the end his undoing. The world was too bright for him to handle." ...|$|E

But I inducted Metallica a couple of years ago, and it was really <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>thing</b> to see as all these people were being inducted. It made me love it.

2500|$|Another columnist, writing {{under the}} name [...] "Roundy," [...] wrote that Kirk gave him [...] "an eye full," [...] turning plays [...] "so fast that the thing is looked up in the stands as a joke." [...] Roundy {{continued}} in his praise of Kirk as follows:"As soon as Kirk grabs a pass he becomes a halfback with his speed and trick running. [...] His run on the kickoff through the whole Illinois team proved that, for an end, he {{is all over the}} field and has a nose for fumbles, is strong and tricky. [...] There {{is no such thing as}} boxing this bird. Kirk, and his tackling of receivers of punts is <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>thing</b> to see. [...] So the ends are the strongest spot on the team. [...] These two birds can play on my team any time, any place, anywhere, and at any price." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2017, WWE started {{promoting}} the [...] "Unleash Your Warrior" [...] breast cancer awareness campaign {{in partnership with}} the Susan G. Komen Foundation, where Warrior's likeness was promoted on television by WWE wrestlers and breast cancer survivors. WWE has been criticized for using Warrior as the inspirational [...] "emblem" [...] of the campaign. Pro Wrestling Torch described Warrior in real-life having made public [...] "vile, bigoted, hateful, judgmental comments about a cancer victim, Hurricane Katrina victims, homosexual people, a woman defending a gay man, and even Martin Luther King Jr." [...] For example, when Bobby Heenan contracted cancer, Warrior said, [...] "Karma is just <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>thing</b> to behold." [...] Vice wrote that [...] "completely whitewashing his past and elevating his likeness to a bland symbol of corporate altruism is shockingly tone-deaf, especially for a company that's at least outwardly trying to appear progressive, inclusive and diverse". In response, WWE said that the Unleash Your Warrior campaign and the Warrior Award and [...] "recognize individuals that exhibit the strength and courage of WWE's legendary character The Ultimate Warrior. Any attempt to distract from the mission of these initiatives and take the spotlight away from the honorees is unfortunately misguided." ...|$|E

2500|$|Michael Musto of The Village Voice {{commented on}} the media's {{reaction}} to the incident, saying, [...] "Janet became a symbolic Joan of Arc to burn at the stake. I actually do think her breast {{was used as a}} diversionary tactic – I'm not sure to distract from Iraq specifically – but it did distract from important issues, from things we actually should be appalled by. The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone." [...] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor [...] "is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>thing.</b> There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS". The fact that it happened in an election year [...] "did have {{a great deal to do}} with it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people." [...] Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as [...] "contradictory", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both [...] "very sexual" [...] and [...] "practically omnipresent". Jackson also said the mishap was [...] "not intentional" [...] and a [...] "costume accident", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way." [...] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, [...] "It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine going on in the world and yet people made such a big deal about a breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. Why would you do that and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense." [...] In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. [...] "People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask me questions that shock me. Not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill. People push you and you start to think, 'Can I handle this?' But I know I can." ...|$|E
