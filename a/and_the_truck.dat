5|$|Quantum of Solace was {{the last}} in Ford Motor's three-film deal that began with 2002's Die Another Day. Although Ford sold over 90% of the Aston Martin company in 2007, the Aston Martin DBS V12 {{returned}} for the film's car chase around Lake Garda; Dan Bradley was hired as second unit director because of {{his work on the}} second and third Bourne films, so the film would continue the gritty action style begun in Casino Royale. He had intended to use Ford GTs for the opening chase, but it was replaced by the Alfa Romeo 159. After location filming in Italy, further close-ups of Craig, the cars <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> were shot at Pinewood against a blue screen. Originally three Alfa Romeos were in the sequence: but Forster felt the scene was running too long and re-edited the scene so it only looked like two Romeos were chasing Bond. Six Aston Martins were destroyed during filming, {{and one of them was}} purchased by a fan.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the film}} was set in Istanbul, Turkey. Locations {{included}} the Basilica Cistern, Hagia Sophia and the Sirkeci railway station which also {{was used for the}} Belgrade and Zagreb railway stations. The MI6 office in London, SPECTRE Island, the Venice hotel and the interior scenes of the Orient Express were filmed at Pinewood Studios with some footage of the train. In the film, the train journey was set in Eastern Europe. The journey <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> ride were shot in Argyll, Scotland and Switzerland. The end scenes for the film were shot in Venice. However, to qualify for the British film funding of the time, at least 70 percent {{of the film}} had to have been filmed in Great Britain or the Commonwealth. The Gypsy camp was also to be filmed in an actual camp in Topkapi, but was actually shot in a replica of it in Pinewood. The scene with rats (after the theft of the Lektor) was shot in Spain, as Britain did not allow filming with wild rats, and an attempt filming white rats painted in cocoa in Turkey did not work. Principal photography began on 1 April 1963, and wrapped on 23 August. Ian Fleming spent a week in the Istanbul shoot, supervising production and touring the city with the producers.|$|E

25|$|Lack of {{exercise}} is another contributing factor to the obesity epidemic {{in the truck}} driver population. Almost 90% of truck drivers exercise only sometimes or never and only 8% exercise regularly. This is largely determined by long work hours and tight deadlines, {{the adoption of a}} sedentary lifestyle and a lack of a place to exercise. Though some fitness resources are available for truckers, most are scarce. Available areas are truck stops, highway rest areas, trucking terminals, warehouses, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> cab. However, there are many parking restrictions and safety concerns in trying to incorporate exercise into the daily routine.|$|E

25|$|Crowds {{began to}} gather on Superior Avenue {{almost as soon}} as the {{shooting}} started. Superior Avenue is a major city thoroughfare which also carries U.S. Route 6. As police vehicles began racing down Superior Avenue to reach E. 120th Street, E. 123rd Street, Lakeview Road, and E. 124th Street, the crowd began throwing rocks at police and jeering them. At 9:15 PM, Mayor Stokes called Ohio Governor Jim Rhodes to inform him that a riot in Cleveland was likely. The governor called Major General Sylvester Del Corso, Adjutant General of the Ohio Army National Guard, and had the National Guard placed on alert. By 9:30 PM, the crowd numbered close to a thousand, mostly young adult, teenage, and pre-adolescent African American males. About this time, the Glenville riots broke out. A Molotov cocktail hit a marked police vehicle, causing it to burst into flames. A commercial panel truck, driving down Superior Avenue, was stopped by the crowd, the white driver brutally beaten, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> overturned and set afire. A black Cleveland Police officer, Herbert Reed, was pulled from his vehicle and savagely beaten. Two television news vehicles were also set aflame.|$|E

Allen later told detectives he stopped at an intersection and abandoned Clemmons <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck,</b> claiming he [...] "wants no part of this".

500|$|Both the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and Transport Canada {{conducted}} {{investigations into}} the accident. The RCMP released its report on July 29, 2008. The report stated that the van would not have passed a safety inspection {{at the time of}} the accident because of rust in its body, worn all-season tires, and faulty brakes. None of these factors could be identified as the sole cause of the accident, but the report noted that [...] "together, they certainly contributed". The report added that speed was not a factor in the crash, as the van was only travelling about [...] <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> at approximately [...] at the time of impact, both of which were well below the posted limit of [...] The van had been inspected on October 29, 2007, just over two months prior to the collision, and was four months away from its next inspection.

500|$|Crossing the Sahara was {{considered}} particularly perilous {{at the time}} because of guerilla forces hiding in the mountains. The medicines carried by the truck would have been valuable loot for these groups, {{and for the first}} part of the desert the expedition was accompanied by the French Foreign Legion. The instruction the men received was [...] "No stops, drive for your lives, even if you get a flat tire." [...] The crossing passed without violent incidents, however, and greater problems were presented by the elements. There were no roads in the desert, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> was heavily loaded and not especially adapted to the conditions. Several times it got stuck in the desert sand; the crew had to place steel plates underneath for traction and spend hours digging out the sand from under the wheels. This took a great toll on the men, who had a limited supply of water, in temperatures approaching 50°C. The crew spent most nights in oases along the way, but on occasion also slept in sleeping bags in the sand.|$|E

500|$|Throughout filming, various scenes {{make use}} of all three effects departments. For scenes {{involving}} the floating, fiery spirit of Mary Winchester in [...] "Home", a small and slim stuntman wearing a fire suit was lit on fire and raised into the air on wires. For the spirit's transition into Mary's normal form, Smith {{stood in front of}} a black background with wind blowing onto her, and the two scenes were later combined in post-production. Many aspects went into filming the crash scene in the season finale [...] "Devil's Trap". For the interior scenes used in the first moments of the Impala being hit, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Padalecki, and Ackles were required to sit in the car, which was in front of a blue screen. A sheet of Lexan placed very close to the passenger-side window protected the actors as the window was shattered, and at the same time, cannons beneath the frame blew out pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window exploded onto them. For scenes of the actual crash, the car and truck were cabled together by a winch, and driven toward one another. The intention was for a cannon to launch the Impala into the air at the collision point, causing the car to then barrel roll as the truck drives away. However, the car became stuck in the truck's bumper, forcing the cannon to fail <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> to go out of control.
