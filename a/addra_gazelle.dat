The {{following is a}} list of the Species Survival Plans (SSP) that the zoo is involved with: addax, Chinese alligator, mandrill, bongo, kori bustard, fishing cat, cheetah, chimpanzee, Lake Victoria cichlids, Andean condor, wattled crane, African elephant, <b>addra</b> <b>gazelle,</b> white-cheeked gibbon, gorilla, great hornbill, rhinoceros hornbill, spectacled langur, ring-tailed lemur, ruffed lemur, mona monkey, Allen's swamp monkey, Bali mynah, ocelot, okapi, Arabian oryx, scimitar-horned oryx, Oriental small-clawed otter, thick-billed parrot, African penguin, Mauritius pink pigeon, Aruba Island rattlesnake, black rhinoceros, Louisiana pine snake, black-handed spider monkey, cottontop tamarin, golden lion tamarin, Indochinese tiger, Sumatran tiger, Puerto Rican crested toad, radiated tortoise, Swainson's toucan, and Grevy's zebra.|$|E
25|$|The Wilds of Africa Adventure Safari is a 20-minute, one-mile, narrated {{monorail}} ride, which travels {{around the}} watering hole (hippopotamus) rain forest (okapi), mountain (Nubian ibex), woodlands (Grévy's zebra), river (waterbuck, greate white pallicans, Goliath herons, blue cranes), arid desert (scimitar-horned oryx, <b>addra</b> <b>gazelle),</b> semi-arid desert (addax, gemsbok, ostrich) and bush (gerenuk, red-crowned cranes, greater kudu, Thomson's gazelle, marabou storks) exhibits. The monorail features aerial {{views of the}} Simmons Hippo Outpost, Chimpanzee Forest, Nile crocodile, and Penguin Cove exhibits, which are also accessible via the Nature Trail. The monorail originally opened in 1990 but {{after two decades of}} use and over a million passengers, the attraction began to show its age with aging infrastructure and several electrical outages that left passengers stranded on the tour. The final incident in August 2014 prompted zoo officials to shut down the attraction for evaluation. Following the evaluation the DZS decided a $3 million renovation was in order. On March 25, 2016, the Monorail Safari reopened as the Wilds of Africa Adventure Safari featuring a new sound system, an upgraded station, air-conditioning, upgraded mechanical and electrical components and new graphics on the individual cars. Additionally, a diesel powered tug is now on standby to nudge the trains back to the station {{in the event of a}} power failure.|$|E

50|$|White Oak has {{maintained}} a breeding herd of addra gazelles since 1983, and since then, more than 280 have been born at the center. White Oak participates in the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' Dama (<b>Addra)</b> <b>Gazelle</b> Species Survival Plan.|$|E
50|$|During {{the summer}} of 2008, there were {{numerous}} births at the zoo to animals that are or have been listed as endangered species. In June 2008, there was {{the birth of a}} female snow leopard cub and three trumpeter swan cygnets. This was followed by the August birth of a female <b>addra</b> <b>gazelle.</b>|$|E
50|$|The San Antonio Zoo {{housed the}} first herd of <b>addra</b> <b>gazelle</b> in captivity in 1969 and {{continues}} to be active in the breeding program for this critically endangered species. Due to the former hoofstock quarantine point in San Antonio, the San Antonio Zoo has historically had a wide variety of hoofstock species.|$|E
50|$|Captive {{breeding}} is a {{very popular}} way to help an endangered species repopulate. The species reproduce in captivity, but the small founder population potentially presents a problem and may result in inbreeding. The primary focus of European EAZA zoos is the mhorr gazelle (N. d. mhorr), while {{the primary focus of}} North American AZA zoos is the <b>addra</b> <b>gazelle</b> (N. d. ruficollis). Mhorr gazelles are also kept in North African facilities and both subspecies are kept in the Middle East. These are maintained as part of the European Endangered Species Programme and Species Survival Plan. The studbooks include 293 mhorr (2014) and 168 addra gazelles (2012). One participant in the <b>addra</b> <b>gazelle</b> plan, White Oak Conservation in Yulee, Florida, has bred the gazelles since 1983, resulting in nearly 300 births. Several hundred additional animals that are not managed as part of the studbooks are kept privately, especially in Texas.|$|E
50|$|The Savannah {{is home to}} {{many species}} of antelope, birds, and even reptiles. The zoo {{accommodates}} this by having a large field, with several night houses for the animals to sleep in and several places for the weary animals to hide if need be. Currently, the zoo has several animals calling the African Savannah home, including sable antelope, Nile lechwe, <b>addra</b> <b>gazelle,</b> spur-winged geese, African spurred tortoises, zebra, wattled cranes, and ostriches.|$|E
50|$|The dama gazelle, <b>addra</b> <b>gazelle,</b> or mhorr gazelle (Nanger dama, {{formerly}} Gazella dama) is {{a species}} of gazelle. It lives in Africa in the Sahara desert and the Sahel. This critically endangered species has disappeared from most of its former range due to overhunting and habitat loss, and natural populations only remain in Chad, Mali, and Niger. Its habitat includes grassland, shrubland, semi-deserts, open savanna and mountain plateaus. Their diets includes grasses, leaves (especially Acacia leaves), shoots, and fruit.|$|E
50|$|The {{dama gazelle}} is {{generally}} {{divided into three}} subspecies based on the colour of the animal's back, flanks and haunches. These three subspecies occupied three blocks running along the east-west axis of the gazelle's range. The easternmost is the N. dama ruficollis (common name <b>addra</b> <b>gazelle)</b> whose historical range was {{to the east of}} 15°E. The westernmost is the N. dama mhorr (common name mohor or mhorr gazelle) whose historical range was to the west of 7°E. Between the two was the historical range of the N. dama dama. Genetic studies have raised questions over the validity of these subspecies and the variation in colour (phenotype) appears to be clinal.|$|E

50|$|White Oak Conservation is 700 {{acres of}} the 13,000 acres on White Oak Plantation, which is mostly forest, wetlands, arts and {{wildlife}} facilities, and a golf course outside Yulee, Florida just below the Georgia state line along the St. Marys River. The site houses more than 200 animals from 20-plus species and is internationally known for its wildlife conservation. It {{has been successful in}} breeding several types of endangered, threatened and vulnerable species, including <b>addra</b> <b>gazelle,</b> cheetah, gerenuk, Mississippi sandhill crane, okapi, and three of the five species of rhinoceros. The site also accommodates conferences and has welcomed renowned guests, most notably former U.S. President Bill Clinton. Additionally, White Oak was home to the Mikhail Baryshnikov Dance Studio, now located in New York, which was visited by choreographers, dance troupes and others in the performing arts from around the world.|$|E

40|$|Social {{networks}} {{analysis tools}} {{were used to}} investigate the social structures of two African ungulate species. Captive herds of <b>addra</b> <b>gazelle</b> (Gazella dama) and roan antelope (Hipptragus equinus) were observed. Social networks were constructed of each herd's affiliative (socially cohesive) interactions and nearest-neighbor (closest individual within 2 body lengths) associations during three time periods. I evaluated whether network measures {{could be explained by}} individual, dyadic or sub-group attributes at three levels of social network organization. Both roan and addra males were very central to their networks, and in some time periods so were juveniles. Roan and addra partner preferences differed, with addra tending to affiliate by age class while roan were more variable in their partner preferences. Matrilinealy-related sub-groups were also identified in addra. This networks analysis approach has broad applicability for characterizing animal social organizations as well monitoring captive populations...|$|E
