40|$|Abstract. We {{address the}} issue of {{low-level}} segmentation for monochrome images. The proposed approach relies on the formulation of the problem in terms of an energy partition of the image domain. In this context, given an pseudo-metric and a set <b>of</b> source <b>points,</b> a tessellation <b>of</b> the space can be constructed by the <b>assignation</b> <b>of</b> every <b>point</b> to the closest source. We propose two applications of this approach to segmentation problems, based on the study of two energies that treat the image at different levels of analysis. The first energy, called the path variation is used to create a pre-segmentation of the original image. In the second part, where the energy is induced by a ultrametric, we discuss the construction of hierarchies of partitions based on the pre-segmented image...|$|R

This paper presents two electronicmeasurement systems which enable the computerizedstudy of the optical encoder and force sensor, respectively.

40|$|AbstractThis paper deals the {{determination}} of the particle size distribution of a material nominally (and inadequately) described as “ 0 – 10 silica”. First, we will outline the routes to obtaining a stable set of light scattering data via wet and dry laser diffraction determination. These stable data are a prerequisite for the deconvolution to a particle size distribution. Second, we will focus on the importance of using the correct optical constants (real and imaginary parts of the refractive index) in order that the derived particle size distribution is correctly stated. In particular this robustness study will show how incorrect optical properties can influence the form (shape) of the derived distribution, plus <b>assignation</b> <b>of</b> key <b>points</b> in the distribution (in particular, x 10). Certain supplementary information is essential in confirming the correct optical properties•Density via helium gas pycnometry•X-ray diffraction (XRD) for polymorph confirmation•Becke lines for bracketing the real part of the refractive index•Volume concentration experiment for measurement of the imaginary/absorptive part of the refractive indexIn this manner we can then be confident of a stated particle size distribution and an awareness of the factors that can significantly affect this derived distribution...|$|R

The experimental measurement system presented inthis paper satisfies these requirements. The undergraduates understand how to design (hardware and software) such system and they can apply previous knowledge about sensors, computers and dataacquisition modules. The measurement system is organized around a PC and based on two I- 7000 remote controllable data acquisition modules; the main features of these electronic modules and some design considerations are also presented. This experimentalsystem can measure {{the diameter of the}} explored part (screw, rivet, rod) and depth of the explored hole (or thickness of the explored ring) using two inductive sensors with analog outputs. The transfercharacteristic of each studied sensor can also be displayed after the <b>assignation</b> <b>of</b> the measurement <b>points.</b> The hardware architecture and some experimental results justify the utility of this measurement system for students and researchers...|$|R
