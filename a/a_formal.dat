40|$|General {{properties}} of an Abelian connection in Fedosov deformation quantization are investigated. Definition and criterion of being <b>a</b> finite <b>formal</b> series for <b>an</b> Abelian connection are presented. A proof that in 2 -dimensional (2 -D) case the Abelian connection is <b>an</b> ifinite <b>formal</b> series is done. Comment: 13 pages; new {{formulation of the}} criterion, when the Abelian connection is <b>a</b> finite <b>formal</b> series, is proposed. Modified proof of the fact, that on 2 -D symplectic space the Abelian correction is <b>an</b> infinite <b>formal</b> series, is shown. The part devoted to different symplectic connections generating the same Abelian correction, has been removed. It {{will be added to}} another pape...|$|R

40|$|We {{prove the}} {{following}} criterion for the pro-representability of the deformation cohomology of <b>a</b> commutative <b>formal</b> Lie group. Let f be a flat and separated morphism between noetherian schemes. Assume that {{the target of}} f is flat over the integers. For <b>a</b> commutative <b>formal</b> Lie group E, we have the deformation cohomology of f with coefficients in E at our disposal. If the higher direct images of the tangent space of E are locally free and of finite rank then the deformation cohomology is pro-representable by <b>a</b> commutative <b>formal</b> Lie group.
