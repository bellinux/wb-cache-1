40|$|AbstractMethods {{to assess}} the {{physical}} habitat provide important tools for many aspects of river management. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>units</b> (defined as a homogeneous patch of flow type and substrate) were described in mountain streams of Central Argentina {{and the distribution of}} macrozoobenthos in these habitat units was analyzed. Four streams from the upper Carcarañá River Basin (Córdoba, Argentina) were sampled in two hydrological periods. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>units</b> (as substrate and flow type), current velocity, depth, macrophytes and macroalgae were assessed. Three benthic samples were taken in each <b>hydraulic</b> <b>unit.</b> A total of 12 <b>hydraulic</b> <b>units</b> were registered, which varied seasonally in their proportional abundance. The highest values of taxonomic richness, total abundance, diversity and evenness were found in the low-water period. The most heterogeneous <b>hydraulic</b> <b>units</b> (characterized by substrate of diverse grain size) presented the highest richness, diversity and evenness, whereas the highest total abundance was observed in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>units</b> with homogeneous substrate, such as bedrock or gravel sand. Canonical correspondence analysis grouped samples and taxa mainly in relation to the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>units,</b> and temporal variation in macroinvertebrate assemblages was observed. We found that the interaction between hydrological and geomorphological conditions affected benthic assemblages and that their organization is important at a mesoscale. Therefore, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>units</b> may be considered important tools in assessing stream integrity in lotic systems of central Argentina...|$|R
