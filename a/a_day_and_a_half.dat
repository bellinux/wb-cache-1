5|$|Several {{other factors}} {{complicated}} {{the rise of}} nationalism in the German states. The man-made factors included political rivalries between members of the German confederation, particularly between the Austrians and the Prussians, and socio-economic competition among the commercial and merchant interests and the old land-owning and aristocratic interests. Natural factors included widespread drought in the early 1830s, {{and again in the}} 1840s, and a food crisis in the 1840s. Further complications emerged {{as a result of a}} shift in industrialization and manufacturing; as people sought jobs, they left their villages and small towns to work during the week in the cities, returning for <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> on weekends.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, Danny Gardella, who {{had left}} the New York Giants for the Mexican League in 1946, filed suit against Major League Baseball, {{claiming}} Chandler's ban on players {{who went to the}} Mexican League had denied him a means of pursuing his livelihood. Gardella demanded $100,000 in damages from the suspension, and claimed that the award should be tripled because baseball was subject to federal antitrust laws. Similar suits were filed by Max Lanier and Fred Martin, both of whom also played in Mexico. On June 2, 1949, a federal court refused to reinstate the three players pending their trials, but urged that the antitrust issues be adjudicated as soon as possible. Attempting to alleviate the legal pressure on Major League Baseball, Chandler lifted the bans on players who had gone to Mexico, reinstating them almost two years early. Lanier and Martin dropped their suits, but Gardella pursued his. After Gardella's lawyer publicly questioned Chandler in court about baseball's antitrust exemption for <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> in September 1949, baseball executives, including Chandler, agreed to settle Gardella's case for $60,000.|$|E

25|$|Play {{was only}} {{possible}} {{from the end of}} the second scheduled day, and both teams made heavy weather of bowling their opponents out. Big centuries from Miandad and Malik put the tourists in a commanding position, but they were stymied by only having <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> to bowl England out twice, and once Stewart had settled into his innings the draw was the only likely outcome.|$|E

Roddenberry later claimed that around $257,000 was spent on the episode, and said that he could have saved a further $20,000 if he had not insisted on high quality casting and sets. He also claimed that the original Ellison version would have cost a further $200,000 on top of what was already spent.|$|E
25|$|The pace of {{the trials}} was very fast before the standing-room-only, all-white audience. The judge and {{prosecutor}} wanted to speed the nine trials to avoid violence, so the first trial took <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> and the rest took place one right after the other, in just one day. The judge had ordered the Alabama bar to assist the defendants, but the only attorney who volunteered was Milo Moody, a 69-year-old attorney who had not defended a case in decades. The judge persuaded Stephen Roddy, a Chattanooga, Tennessee, real estate lawyer, to assist him. Roddy admitted he had not had time to prepare and was not familiar with Alabama law, but agreed to aid Moody.|$|E
25|$|Alliance then {{returned}} to the main battle, firing two broadsides. Again, these did at least as much damage to Richard as to Serapis, but the tactic worked to the extent that, unable to move, and with Alliance keeping well out of the line of his own great guns, Captain Pearson of Serapis accepted that prolonging the battle could achieve nothing, so he surrendered. Most of Bonhomme Richard's crew immediately transferred to other vessels, and after <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> of frantic repair efforts, it was decided that the ship could not be saved, so it was allowed to sink, and Jones took command of Serapis for the trip to neutral (but American-sympathizing) Holland.|$|E

25|$|England's second worst {{defeat in}} Test cricket {{at this stage}} came as they were totally outplayed. For West Indies, Kanhai (157), Sobers (150 not out) and a maiden Test century from Julien (121) led to a huge total, {{at the time the}} highest by a West Indies Test team in England. Only Fletcher, with 68, coped with hostile bowling from Vanburn Holder and Boyce, and when England {{followed}} on Fletcher was again the main resistance, scoring an undefeated 86. A bomb scare on the Saturday led to the ground being evacuated for 85 minutes; it was decided to add extra time to each of the remaining days of the match, but with the West Indies winning with <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> to spare it was not needed.|$|E
