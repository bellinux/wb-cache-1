40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we present}} the {{definitions}} of generalized e-concave <b>operators</b> <b>and</b> generalized e-convex <b>operators,</b> which are the generalizations of e-concave <b>operators</b> <b>and</b> e-convex <b>operators,</b> respectively. Without compactness or continuity assumption of generalized e-concave <b>operators</b> <b>and</b> generalized e-convex <b>operators,</b> we have proved the existence, uniqueness and monotone iterative techniques of their fixed points. Our results are even new to e-concave <b>operators</b> <b>and</b> e-convex <b>operators.</b> Finally, we apply the results to the singular boundary value problems for second order differential equations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this talk}} I {{will give a}} {{overview}} on the connections between closure <b>operators</b> <b>and</b> choice <b>operators</b> <b>and</b> on related results. An operator on a finite set S is a map defined on the set P(S) of all the subsets of S. A closure operator is an extensive, isotone <b>and</b> idempotent <b>operator.</b> A choice operator c is a contracting operator (c(A) ⊆ A, for every A ⊆ S). Choice <b>operators</b> <b>and</b> their lattices have been very studied {{in the framework of}} the theory of the revealed preference in economics. A significant connection between closure <b>operators</b> <b>and</b> choice <b>operators</b> is the duality between anti-exchange operators (corresponding to convex geometries) <b>and</b> path-independent choice <b>operators.</b> More generally, there is a one-to-one correspondence between closure <b>operators</b> <b>and</b> choice <b>operators...</b>|$|R

5|$|During {{trials of}} the first submarines, the {{propulsion}} system {{was found to be}} prone to failure for a variety of reasons. Most failures were attributed to the fifteen-tank diesel fuel system: the tanks were designed to fill with salt water as they were emptied to maintain neutral buoyancy, but water would regularly enter the engines due to a combination of poor design, gravity separation of the fuel and water being insufficient, <b>and</b> <b>operator</b> error resulting from poor training. Problems were also caused by bacterial contamination of the diesel fuel, which, along with the salt water, would cause the fuel pumps to rust and other components to seize. The fuel-related issues were solved by installing coalescers, improving training and operational procedures, and adding biocides to the fuel.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} {{announcement}} proclaiming the ACC's expansion to 12teams, several cities and sports organizations were preparing bids {{to host the}} ACC Football Championship Game. The prospect {{of tens of thousands}} of visitors could provide a multimillion-dollar economic boost for a host city and region while requiring few, if any, additional facilities. One early contender was the city of Charlotte, North Carolina. Even before Virginia Tech, Miami, and Boston College were chosen as the ACC's picks to expand, Carolinas Stadium Corporation, the owner <b>and</b> <b>operator</b> of Charlotte's Ericsson Stadium (as it was called then) lobbied heavily for Charlotte's selection. Other early options included Orlando, Tampa, Atlanta, and Jacksonville.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, {{the city}} has been home to other large {{corporations}} in the central United States, making Denver a key trade point for the country. Several well-known companies originated in or have relocated to Denver. William Ainsworth opened the Denver Instrument Company in 1895 to make analytical balances for gold assayers. Its factory is now in Arvada. AIMCO (NYSE: AIV)—the largest owner <b>and</b> <b>operator</b> of apartment communities in the United States, with approximately 870 communities comprising nearly 136,000 units in 44 states—is headquartered in Denver, employing approximately 3,500 people. Also Samsonite Corp., the world's largest luggage manufacturer, began in Denver in 1910 as Shwayder Trunk Manufacturing Company, but Samsonite closed its NE Denver factory in 2001, and moved its headquarters to Massachusetts after a change of ownership in 2006. The Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph Company, founded in Denver in 1911, is now a part of telecommunications giant CenturyLink.|$|E

However, there is no direct rail link between the SIR and the subway system proper. SIR riders do get a free transfer to New York City Subway lines, and the line is included on official New York City Subway maps. Commuters who use the railway typically use the Staten Island Ferry to reach Manhattan; the line is accessible from within the Ferry Terminal and most of its trains connect with the ferry.|$|E

5|$|The {{exterior}} of the school was shot using the left wing of the then-abandoned Church of Saint Mary the Virgin building almost directly opposite the real school on West 46th Street in Times Square. The Rocky Horror Picture Show midnight screening sequence was filmed at the 8th Playhouse located on 52 West 8th Street, New York. Sal Piro, president of The Rocky Horror Picture Show Fan Club, appears as an emcee at the screening. Parker later hired Steadicam inventor <b>and</b> <b>operator</b> Garrett Brown to film Doris and Ralph's dialogue scene in a New York City Subway station. Montgomery MacNeil's apartment was located on 1564 Broadway and West 46th Street, Manhattan.|$|E
5|$|The problem {{occurred}} {{because of the}} way the vehicles were modified for right-hand-drive. The investigation showed that although the brake pedal had been moved to the right, it was still connected to a mechanism on the passenger side. This was covered by felt carpet and meant that both the front passenger and driver could activate the brakes. A further investigation by Watchdog later found the same problem in other Citroën models and some vehicles produced by Renault and Peugeot, some of which were registered in 2002. All three manufacturers worked with the Vehicle <b>and</b> <b>Operator</b> Services Agency (VOSA) to identify the severity of the problem but no vehicles were found to be affected enough to issue recalls.|$|E
5|$|The {{promotion}} {{strategy for}} the film played on nationalist sentiment by announcing that La tragedia del silencio was the first authentically Colombian movie. It was first screened to the public on 18 July 1924 in Faenza theatre in Bogotá, attracting a large audience. There were several technical problems including power failure and projector errors, caused in particular by the nervousness of the director and his son, {{the director of the}} theatre Joaquín Francisco, <b>and</b> <b>operator</b> Gustavo Francisco. However, the film was well received by the public and the press, although some viewers complained about the poor image quality. The theatre was crowded during the seventeen showings of the film, but it was not very successful financially.|$|E

In 1992, as co-owner of New Choice Builders, Woolfolk began building affordable single-family housing in Houston's revitalized communities. In 1994, Woolfolk worked with Home Ownership Partners, Inc., to build affordable housing for residents of Fort Bend County, Texas, a suburban county outside of Houston. Woolfolk procured the largest HUD grant given at that time by Fort Bend County for affordable housing assistance. Starting in approximately 1995, Woolfolk worked for Intrepid Holdings, Inc. in Houston. At Intrepid, he developed residential lots for several large builders including US Home, Gateway Homes, Texas Colonial, and KB Home.|$|E
5|$|The mid-1960s saw several {{proposals}} for regional airports in Finnmark. A committee appointed by Finnmark County Council proposed, in 1966, Hammerfest {{as one of}} six suitable sites for a simple airfield to serve air ambulance and air taxi services. At {{the same time the}} government was working on plans to build a national network of short take-off and landing airport. The plans eventually called for six airports in northern Troms and Finnmark, a plan passed by Parliament in 1972. Both Widerøe and Norving applied to operate the subsidized routes in Finnmark, and the contract was awarded to Widerøe, which operated the subsidized routes {{in the rest of the}} country. The airport opened on 1 August 1974 with Hammerfest Municipality as the owner <b>and</b> <b>operator.</b> The same day four other airports in Finnmark and Troms commenced operations. These were all originally served using Widerøe's de Havilland Canada Twin Otter aircraft. The airline established its technical base for Finnmark at Hammerfest.|$|E
