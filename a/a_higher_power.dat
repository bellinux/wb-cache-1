5|$|Dante's {{rewriting}} of the Lucanian scene 'recuperates' {{the witch}} Erichtho by making her {{necessary to the}} Dantean Virgil's status as guide: she thus functions {{in accord with the}} Christian providence that controls the advancement of the Commedias plot line. At the same time, the Lucanian Erichtho is both marginalized and subordinated to <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>power.</b> In this sense, Dante's rewriting of Erichtho also undoes Lucan's subversion of the original Virgilian model.|$|E

5|$|Demons can {{be talked}} with in battle and {{recruited}} {{if the right}} conversation is initiated. Once {{a part of the}} player's party, they will fight alongside them. In addition to standard demons, the player can ally with one human companion, with three being available on the first playthrough and a fourth unlocking during the second. When the player or their human partner dies in battle, they are granted a Guardian Spirit, who revives them at the last save point and teaches them new skills and alter the player's stats. The Guardian's specialties affect how stats are changed: <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>power</b> ranking will raise the player's strength, but lower magic will decrease their Magic Point meter. The Guardian changes each time the player dies.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Vashyron and his comrades learn the full tale from Juris, Rowen {{is in the}} midst of a crisis of faith due to his control over the Zenith System through his ring. During the party's {{confrontation}} with Sullivan where he threatens to destroy Leanne's quartz, Rowen shoots Sullivan to try and prove the existence of <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>power</b> through Leanne's survival. The three then confront Rowen directly and fatally wound him, but Rowen's control of the Zenith System preserves his life. Vashyron calls Zephyr and Leanne off, seeing further fighting is pointless. During the game's credits, Rowen uses his power to resurrect the Cardinals, then leaves the control ring on Frieda's grave, and Sullivan is seen reuniting with Rebecca. In a post-credit scene, Leanne, Zephyr and Vashyron explore the now-clean world beyond Basel, and Leanne's quartz is revealed to have been safely embedded in her hand.|$|E
5|$|In his Critique of Pure Reason, German philosopher Immanuel Kant {{stated that}} no {{successful}} argument for God's existence arises from reason alone. In his Critique of Practical Reason {{he went on}} to argue that, despite the failure of these arguments, morality requires that God's existence is assumed, owing to practical reason. Rather than proving the existence of God, Kant was attempting to demonstrate that all moral thought requires the assumption that God exists. Kant argued that humans are obliged to bring about the summum bonum: the two central aims of moral virtue and happiness, where happiness arises out of virtue. As ought implies can, Kant argued, it must be possible for the summum bonum to be achieved. He accepted that it is not within the power of humans to bring the summum bonum about, because we cannot ensure that virtue always leads to happiness, so there must be <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>power</b> who has the power to create an afterlife where virtue can be rewarded by happiness.|$|E

5|$|Walter {{approaches}} Alistair as {{a fellow}} man of science, who is replacing components that form a time machine that he has constructed within his body. Walter professes that Alistair's attempt to jump back several months would require {{a great deal more}} power than Alistair has predicted, possibly killing hundreds in the area near where he appears. Alistair, aware of this, recalls an empty field where he was at, a few blocks from where his fiancée died, and plans to use this field where only the vegetation will die out from his arrival. Walter tells Alistair how to correct the mistake that caused him to jump to the train but warns him of the other consequences that changing events will bring, explaining that stealing Peter from the parallel universe has left him wracked with regret. Despite being a man of science, Walter's torment over the years drove him to believe in <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>power,</b> and he hopes for a sign of God's forgiveness—and thus, eventually, Peter's—in the form of a white tulip.|$|E
