5|$|In {{avoiding}} {{war with}} Great Britain, he guaranteed {{a decade of}} peace and profitable trade by securing the Jay Treaty in 1795, despite intense opposition from the Jeffersonians. He oversaw {{the creation of a}} strong, well-financed national government that maintained neutrality in the French Revolutionary Wars, suppressed the Whiskey Rebellion, and won wide acceptance amongst Americans. Washington's incumbency established many precedents still in use today, such as the cabinet system, the inaugural address, and the title Mr. President. His retirement from office after two terms established a tradition that lasted until 1940 and was later made law by the 22nd Amendment. He remained non-partisan, never joining the Federalist Party, although he largely supported its policies. Washington's Farewell Address was an influential primer on civic virtue, warning against partisanship, sectionalism, <b>and</b> <b>involvement</b> in foreign wars.|$|E

5|$|Members of {{the student}} press have contributed to activist causes on several notable occasions. At the height of debate on {{coeducation}} in 1880, The Varsity published an article in its inaugural issue voicing in favour of admitting women. In 1895, the university suspended the editor of The Varsity for breach of collegiality, after he published a letter that harshly criticized the provincial government's dismissal of a professor <b>and</b> <b>involvement</b> in academic affairs. University College students then approved a motion by Varsity staff member and future Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King and boycotted lectures for a week. After Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau decriminalized homosexuality throughout Canada in 1969, a medical research assistant placed an advertisement in The Varsity seeking volunteers to establish the first university homophile association in Canada.|$|E

5|$|Nonviolence is an {{overriding}} theme within the Pali Canon. While the early texts condemn killing {{in the strongest}} terms, and portray the ideal king as a pacifist, such a king is nonetheless flanked by an army. It seems that the Buddha's teaching on nonviolence was not interpreted or put into practice in an uncompromisingly pacifist or anti-military-service way by early Buddhists. The early texts assume war to be a fact of life, and well-skilled warriors are viewed as necessary for defensive warfare. In Pali texts, injunctions to abstain from violence <b>and</b> <b>involvement</b> with military affairs are directed at members of the sangha; later Mahayana texts, which often generalise monastic norms to laity, require this of lay people as well.|$|E

There are papers that are very successful, such as the UK-based The Big Issue, which in 2001 sold nearly 300,000 copies a week and earned the equivalent of 1 millionUSD in profits, but many papers sell as few as 3,000 copies a month and barely generate a profit at all for the publishers.|$|E
5|$|The {{requirements}} for admission differ between students from Ontario, other provinces in Canada, and international students {{due to the lack}} of uniformity in marking schemes. In 2016, 44 percent of applications to full-time, first-year studies were accepted. In 2013, the secondary school average for full-time first-year students at Queen's was 89% overall, with the Commerce, Education and Engineering faculties having the highest entrance averages at 91.7%, 90.8%, and 90.6% respectively. The application process emphasizes the mandatory Personal Statement of Experience (PSE). The statement expresses how the applicant's personal experiences may contribute to the university. It focuses on qualifications <b>and</b> <b>involvement</b> outside of academics and is an important factor in determining admission. Several faculties require applicants to submit a supplementary essay.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - Recent {{studies have}} found {{inconsistent}} findings {{on the impact of}} supplier <b>and</b> customer <b>involvement</b> on new product development This study thus aims to explore what contextual factors affect supplier <b>and</b> customer <b>involvement</b> altogether <b>and</b> how such <b>involvement</b> affects new product performance. Design/methodology/approach - The study used structural equation modelling to analyze empirical survey data from 251 manufacturers in Hong Kong. Findings - The study found that modular design, product innovation, and internal coordination are positively correlated with the supplier <b>and</b> customer <b>involvement.</b> Such <b>involvement</b> <b>and</b> product innovation lead to better new product performance. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to the use of cross-sectional data and a single key informant approach, and the industry structure of the sampled industries. Practical implications - The study examines the contextual factors of supplier <b>and</b> customer <b>involvement</b> <b>and</b> how such <b>involvement</b> relates to new product development with new empirical evidence. The study not only provides new empirical evidence to support the importance of supply chain management in product development, but also extends existing literature to identify new contextual factors for such involvement. Originality/value - The study re-examines generalized beliefs about supplier <b>and</b> customer <b>involvement</b> in new product development, and extends prior studies of the contextual dimensions of product modularity, product innovativeness, and internal coordination on such involvement in an empirical way...|$|R

On April 5, 2008, the Canucks' final game of the 2007–08 season, the Vancouver crowd gave Linden a standing ovation before the start of the third period. Once the game ended, the crowd again rose to their feet in recognition of Linden.|$|E
5|$|The socio-religious {{movements}} of the previous centuries, such as Lingayatism, provided momentum for flexible social norms to which women were expected to abide. By this time South Indian women had crossed most barriers and were actively involved in matters hitherto considered the monopoly of men, such as administration, business and trade, <b>and</b> <b>involvement</b> in the fine arts. Tirumalamba Devi who wrote Varadambika Parinayam and Gangadevi who wrote Madhuravijayam were among the notable women poets of the era. Early Telugu women poets like Tallapaka Timmakka and Atukuri Molla became popular during this period. The court of the Nayaks of Tanjore {{is known to have}} patronised several women poets.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Clinical {{practice}} guidelines (CPG) {{are important}} tools for improving patient care. Patient <b>and</b> public <b>involvement</b> is recognised {{as an essential}} component of CPG development and implementation. The Guideline International Network Patient <b>and</b> Public <b>Involvement</b> Working Group (G-I-N PUBLIC) aims to support the development, implementation and evaluation of guideline-oriented patient <b>and</b> public <b>involvement</b> programmes (PPIPs). OBJECTIVE: To develop an international practice and research agenda on patient <b>and</b> public <b>involvement</b> in CPG. METHOD: 56 CPG developers, researchers, and patient/public representatives from 14 different countries, were consulted in an international workshop. Recommendations were validated with G-I-N PUBLIC steering committee members. RESULTS: Many CPG organisations have set up PPIPs that use a range of participation, consultation and communication methods. Current PPIPs aim to improve the quality and responsiveness of CPGs to public expectations and needs, or to foster individual healthcare decisions. Some organisations use structured involvement methods, including providing training for patient and public representatives. A number of financial, organisational and sociopolitical barriers limit patient <b>and</b> public <b>involvement.</b> The paucity of process and impact evaluations limits our current understanding of the conditions under which patient <b>and</b> public <b>involvement</b> is most likely to be effective. CONCLUSION: Greater international collaboration and research are needed to strengthen existing knowledge, development and evaluation of patient <b>and</b> public <b>involvement</b> in CPG...|$|R
