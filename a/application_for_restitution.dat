Mrs. Carbuncle was much too strong, and had fought her battle with the world much too long, to regard such word-pelting as that. She paid no {{attention}} to the note, and as she had {{come to terms with the}} agent of the house by which she was to evacuate it on the following Monday,--a fact which was communicated to Lizzie by the servant,--she did not much regard Lizzie's threat to remain there. She knew, moreover, that arrangements were already being made for the journey to Scotland.|$|E
5000|$|The {{end of the}} war and of Nazi Germany {{raised the}} {{possibility}} of restitution following the loss of the von Mendelssohn art collection. Francesco was no longer in any state to attend to the matter, and it was left to his sister Eleonora to travel to Europe to try and recover the lost art works. After Aldo Cima's suggestion that she should bribe the museum directors had been rejected, she sought to achieve restitution through a combination of appeals for reimbursement and attempts to buy some of the paintings back. One problem that she faced was that the paintings had been the property of her mother, Giulietta von Mendelssohn, who had been classified as an Aryan. It was therefore not possible to demonstrate that she had been forced to give up the collection as a result of race-based persecution. In the end her <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>restitution</b> was rejected by the German authorities in 1953, but by this time Eleonora von Mendelssohn was no longer in a position to know of it. In January 1951 her (fourth) husband, Martin Kosleck fell out of an apartment window and was badly injured. At about the same time, her brother Francesco suffered a stroke following a fight and arrest. Eleonora von Mendelssohn was found dead on 24 January 1951. The evidence suggested suicide.|$|E

40|$|Ernest Goodman (born Ernst Gutmann) was {{a button}} and {{accessories}} salesman who immigrated to the United States in 1936. The collection contains correspondence and official papers belonging {{to him and his}} second wife, Carole Goodman née Vad. The collection documents Ernest’s unsuccessful attempts to bring his parents to the United States between 1936 - 1941 and his and Carole’s <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>restitution</b> <b>for</b> themselves and their parents. A large collection of family photographs, a photo album, and a family tree are also part of the collection. Ernest Goodman was born Ernst Gutmann on June 19, 1910 in Strasbourg, France (then Germany), to Sigmund Gutmann (July 23, 1871 -circa 1941), a textile salesman, and his wife Rose (sometimes spelled Rosa or Rosel), née Schild (April 26, 1887 -circa 1941). Ernest worked as a sales apprentice and later salesman for buttons, costume jewelry, and accessories at Heinrich Wertheimer in Frankfurt am Main from 1926 - 1936. In 1936, Ernest immigrated to the United States under the sponsorship of an uncle living in Greenwood, Missouri. He found work in Greenwood and later in New York City, where he eventually settled. Ernest married Ruth Mosse on May 31, 1940 and they had two children, Marion and Spencer. They later divorced, and Ernest married Carole Vad (otherwise spelled Karole, Karola, or Carola) in 1952. From 1936 until 1941, Ernest tried to enable his parents to immigrate to the United States, but because of bureaucratic delays, his efforts were unsuccessful. His parents were taken to the Łódź ghetto in October of 1941 and were never heard from again. Carole Vad (later Goodman) was born on December 27, 1909 to Andreas Peter Vad and his wife Therese, née Blumann. Carole survived National Socialist persecution by hiding in a doctor’s home and later in a hospital after she took medicine to purposely become ill. She later worked in cosmetics and as a secretary in Germany and New York. Both Ernest and Carole applied <b>for</b> <b>restitution</b> from the German state. Ernest’s claims were mostly successful. Carole could only claim damages for the few months that she was hospitalized and not able to work. It is unclear whether her claims were successful in the end. Carole died in May 1980, and Ernest died on September 10, 2001. Photographs removed to Photograph CollectionProcesseddigitize...|$|R

At least two {{restitution}} claims were rejected because the Committee {{argued that there}} were not enough indications showing coercion {{as the cause of}} the sale. For example, in 2009 the Restitution Committee rejected the <b>application</b> <b>for</b> the <b>restitution</b> of 12 works sold by the Jewish art dealer Kurt Walter Bachstitz to the Sonderauftrag Linz between 1940 and 1941. The Committee argued that Bachstitz had been [...] "undisturbed" [...] {{in the first years of}} the occupation and said it had not found signs of coercion. In 2012 the Commission rejected a claim of the heirs of Benjamin and Nathan Katz, former Jewish art dealers in the Netherlands. The claim related inter alia to 64 works that the art dealership Katz sold to the Sonderauftrag Linz. The Commission came to the conclusion that there were not enough indications demonstrating that the sales were made under duress.|$|R

40|$|Does {{and should}} a wrongdoer’s {{liability}} insurance cover an aggrieved party’s claim <b>for</b> <b>restitution</b> (e. g., {{a claim for}} the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains) ? This article answers those questions. It does so by first answering {{the question of whether}} claims <b>for</b> <b>restitution</b> are covered under the terms of liability insurance policies. Then, after concluding that they are, it addresses the question of whether claims <b>for</b> <b>restitution</b> should be insurable as a matter of public policy and insurance law theory. There are long-standing legal and equitable principles that, on the one hand, dictate that a wrongdoer {{should not be allowed to}} benefit from its wrongdoing, which the wrongdoer would if insurance were allowed to cover claims <b>for</b> <b>restitution.</b> On the other hand, there are competing public policies that favor enforcing contracts and compensating innocent victims. If a claim <b>for</b> <b>restitution</b> is covered by the terms of an insurance policy, but such claims are viewed as uninsurable as a matter of public policy, then policyholders would have paid millions of dollars in premiums for policies that provide illusory coverage and thousands of innocent victims with billions of dollars of claims would not receive compensation. In analyzing these issues, this article does so by using two common examples where the insurability of claims <b>for</b> <b>restitution</b> are regularly implicated—intellectual property infringement claims under Commercial General Liability insurance policies (CGL policies) and shareholder fraud claims under Directors and Officers liability insurance policies (D 2 ̆ 6 O policies) ...|$|R
