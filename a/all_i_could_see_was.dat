2500|$|Suddenly, Comdr. Carpenter hollered, [...] "Hard left rudder." [...] I {{reversed}} the rudder, but the momentum was still carrying {{the ship to}} the right. The ship shuddered for several seconds and slowly started to turn left when an immense explosion took place. I glanced out the porthole and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> a huge cloud in the direction the Juneau had been.|$|E
2500|$|Arizona's Governor Janet Napolitano {{visited the}} {{area at the}} time of the fire. [...] "This is a big, major fire, and it {{concerns}} us all," [...] she said. Regarding her aerial tour, the governor said, [...] "The fire looks a lot better today than it did a week ago. I flew over Mount Graham on July 4 and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> smoke. Now, I can clearly see the perimeters the firefighters have been burning." [...] Napolitano provided for inmate wildland fire crews to provide fire suppression and forest thinning services.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yea, yea," [...] {{she said}} (and I {{knew she was}} nodding her head sagaciously); I {{looked out at the}} room window, but <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> a man {{wheeling}} an empty barrow down the brae.|$|E
60|$|JAMES. He's an ugly customer. That's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> There was {{a little}} carpet bag in his hand.|$|R
5000|$|... "But best of <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{that you}} truly {{are the ones}} to take King’s Quest into the 21st century and {{reintroduce}} it {{to a whole new}} generation." ...|$|R
60|$|And I am {{bound to}} say that, for <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> through {{the mask of}} his face, he was {{satisfied}} with what I gave him, {{though it was not}} much.|$|R
60|$|The {{magistrate}} complimented {{the woman}} on her muscular powers, and the court-room laughed; but <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> a boy {{on the threshold of}} life, passionately crawling to muddy death, and there was no laughter in it.|$|E
60|$|I {{went into}} my room and drew the curtains, {{but there was little}} to notice. My window opened into the courtyard, <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> the warm grey of {{quickening}} sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have written of this day.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{walked a}} few steps away, and stood with his face hidden from me, {{thinking}} again. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> that {{he took off his}} hat and passed his handkerchief over his forehead. All I could hear was that he talked to himself excitedly in his own language.|$|E
60|$|For <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> he {{appeared}} to be a calm and quiet man, intense beneath the surface, with an air of dignity under insult. My chance to observe Wright was lost.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so. I'm {{getting down}} and out over the business. Sir James to-day hadn't got any hope at <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that. <b>I</b> don't like him--we don't gee {{together}} somehow--but he's pretty cute, and I guess he wouldn't quit {{if there was any}} chance of success--now, would he?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Joe laughed, but a long howl {{close by}} made me dive for a ham; {{for in the}} {{darkness}} of the woods the beasts had got closer, and now <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> were several balls of fire not many yards away. Out went the ham, and a snarling sound showed that the wolves were busy eating it.|$|R
60|$|So I went to put {{the stones}} away as safely as I could. While I was doing so I heard the rumble of wheels, and came out {{just in time to}} see a Cape cart, drawn by four very good horses and driven by a Hottentot in a smart hat and a red waistband, pull up at the garden gate. Out of this cart {{presently}} emerged a neatly dressed lady, of whom <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> that she was young, slender and rather tall; also, as her back was towards me, that she had a great deal of auburn hair.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is wonderful," [...] she declared. [...] "I read {{everything}} in the papers about you--and I get the monthly reports, for of course I am a subscriber--so is mother. But--that brings your shameful neglect of us back into my mind. I wrote to you begging {{to be allowed to}} inspect one of your branches, and all I got back was a polite reply from your secretary to the effect that the general public--even subscribers--were never allowed in any of the branches as sightseers, and that <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> the stores and general arrangements, for which he enclosed a view-card." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could do}} nothing, so I sat up, fascinated and powerless, {{and watched the}} struggle. The noonday sun beat down with {{dazzling}} brightness on the naked tennis court. And it was naked. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> the blotch of shadow and the rainbow flashes, the dust rising from the invisible feet, the earth tearing up from beneath the straining foot-grips, and the wire screen bulge once or twice as their bodies hurled against it. That was all, and after a time even that ceased. There were no more flashes, and the shadow had become long and stationary; and I remembered their set boyish faces when they clung to the roots in the deep coolness of the pool.|$|E
6000|$|Some pretended, by {{the help}} of these Second-sight Glasses, to see the common Periods of Life; and Others said, they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> a great way beyond the leap in the Dark: <b>I</b> confess, <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> of the first was, that holding up the Glass against the Sea, I plainly saw, as it were {{on the edge of}} the Horizon, these Words, ...|$|R
60|$|A {{mile and}} a half it must have been to our journey's end. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hear nothing but the fearful rattle of the ancient hack over the uneven brick paving; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> smell nothing but the drizzle, now further flavored with coal smoke and {{something}} like a mixture of tar and oleander blossoms. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> through the streaming windows were two rows of dim houses.|$|R
60|$|I went outside, {{not knowing}} whether {{to be angry}} or amused with these queer people. In the broad light of day Holston looked {{as bad as it}} had made me feel by night. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> were the station and freight-sheds, several stores with high, wide signs, glaringly painted, and a long block of saloons. When I had turned a street corner, however, a number of stores came into view with some three-storied brick buildings, and, farther out, many frame houses.|$|R
60|$|The {{first time}} that I saw her was one autumn morning as I rode to town in a horse-car. It was early, and my only fellow-passenger was a crusty old gentleman, who sat in a corner, reading his paper; so when the car stopped, I glanced out to see who came next, hoping {{it would be a}} pleasanter person. No one {{appeared}} for a minute, and the car stood still, while both driver and conductor looked in the same direction without a sign of impatience. I looked also, but <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> a little girl running across the park, as girls of twelve or thirteen seldom run nowadays, if any one can see them.|$|E
60|$|In vain I {{waited for}} him to start some popular song. His records were only of the best, and the care he took of them was a revelation. He handled each one reverently, as a sacred thing, untying and unwrapping it and {{brushing}} it with a fine camel's hair brush while it revolved and ere he placed the needle on it. For a time <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> the huge brute hands of a brute-driver, with skin off the knuckles, that expressed love in their every movement. Each touch on the discs was a caress, and while the record played he hovered over it and dreamed in some heaven of music all his own.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My {{fault of}} course. One has no {{business}} really to get interested. It's a weakness of mine. His was of another kind. My weakness consists in not having a discriminating eye for the incidental--for the externals--no eye for the hod of the rag-picker or the fine linen of the next man. Next man--that's it. I have met so many men,' he pursued, with momentary sadness--'met them too with a certain--certain--impact, let us say; like this fellow, for instance--and in each case <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> merely the human being. A confounded democratic quality of vision which may be better than total blindness, but has been of no advantage to me, I can assure you. Men expect one {{to take into account}} their fine linen. But I never could get up any enthusiasm about these things. Oh! it's a failing; it's a failing; and then comes a soft evening; a lot of men too indolent for whist--and a story. [...] .' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{followed}} cautiously; but, although I groped {{about in}} <b>all</b> directions, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> nothing. So <b>I</b> stood quite still {{with my back}} to the wall, and called out softly: ...|$|R
60|$|He hesitated. He looked <b>all</b> round. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that he {{was making}} a great effort. The spirit of Paris battled against his better nature. He was tempted, but he didn't fall.|$|R
5000|$|For the {{construction}} of the house was necessary to hire a Japanese company to talara trees at that time the buildings were on archaeological woods for them (some now extinct) are used for construction of the estate. Recall that the Zarate family had bought the state government a portion of the estate [...] "of Lencero". This 5.000 acre property was so extensive that Mr. Zarate bragged saying, [...] "I can climb the biggest tree is the tallest pyramid and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> and beyond is mine ...".|$|R
6000|$|... "Joe grew still by and by, and I {{thought he}} was asleep, for I felt his breath when I tucked him up, and his hand held on to mine. The cold sort of numbed me, and I dropped off, too weak and stupid to think or feel. I never should have waked up if it hadn't been for Joe. When I came to, it was morning, and I thought I was dead, for <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> that great field of white mounds, like graves, and a splendid sky above. Then I looked for Joe, remembering; but he had put my coat back over me, and lay stiff and still under the snow that covered him like a shroud, all except his face. A bit of my cape had blown over it, and when I took it off and the sun shone on his dead face, I declare to you it {{was so full of}} heavenly peace I felt as if that common man had been glorified by God's light, and rewarded by God's 'Well done.' That's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|I learned, however, to my dismay, from a sympathising but inexorable concierge, {{that what}} {{remained}} {{to me of}} the time I had to spend at Beaune, between trains--I had rashly wasted {{half an hour of}} it in breakfasting at the station--was the one hour of the day (that of the dinner of the nuns; the picture is in their refectory) during which the treasure could not be shown. The purpose of the musical chimes to which I had so artlessly listened was to usher in this fruitless interval. The regulation was absolute, and my disappointment relative, as I have been happy to reflect since I [...] "looked up" [...] the picture. Crowe and Cavalcaselle assign it without hesitation to Roger van der Weyden, and give a weak little drawing of it in their [...] "Flemish Painters." [...] I learn from them also--what I was ignorant of--that Nicholas Rollin, Chancellor of Burgundy and founder of the establishment at Beaune, was the original of the worthy kneeling before the Virgin in the magnificent John van Eyck of the Salon Carré. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> the court of the hospital and two or three rooms. The court, with its tall roofs, its pointed gables and spires, its wooden galleries, its ancient well, with an elaborate superstructure of wrought iron, is one of those places into which a sketcher ought to be let loose. It looked Flemish or English rather than French, and a splendid tidiness pervaded it. The porter took me into two ...|$|E
60|$|I was {{not sure}} how far she did believe my assurances, or thought me deceived, when I strenuously denied all evil intent from Harold towards his poor wife, and {{explained}} that he had merely driven over a precipice in the dark, and had a brain fever afterwards; <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> that, though not perfectly satisfied or convinced, she found that her brother would not allow the separation to be kept up, and therefore she resumed her favourite office of adviser. She examined me on the religious habits of my nephews and niece, impressing on {{me that it was}} {{for the sake of the}} latter that my presence at Arghouse was excusable; but insisting that it was incumbent on me to provide her with an elderly governess, both for her sake and my own. I was much afraid of having the governess at once thrust upon me; but, luckily, she did not happen to have one of a chaperon kind of age on her list, so she contented herself with much advice on what I was teaching Dora, so that perhaps I grew restive and was disposed to think it no concern of hers, nor did I tell her that much of the direction of Dora's lessons was with a view to Harold; but she could not have been wholly displeased, since she ended by telling me that mine was a vast opportunity, and that the propriety of my residence at Arghouse entirely depended on the influence I exerted, since any acquiescence in lax and irreligious habits would render my stay hurtful to all parties. She worried me into an inclination to drop all my poor little endeavours, since certainly to have tried to follow out all the details of her counsel would have alienated all three at once.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have been}} wishing to tell you, Charlotte,' added Mary, kindly, 'how much we like Mr. Madison. There were some very {{undesirable}} people among the passengers, who might easily have led him astray; but {{the captain and}} mate both spoke to Lord Ormersfield in the highest terms of his behaviour. He never missed attending prayers on the Sundays; and, from <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>I</b> do fully {{believe that he is}} a sincerely good, religions man; and, if he keeps on as he has begun, I think you are very happy in belonging to him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At first <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{of it was}} {{the little}} patch of light at the window. I made for that until it {{disappeared}} suddenly, and I found myself walking into a tall hedge. I felt my way round this until I came to a small gate, and opening it cautiously, walked, not without some little nervousness, up a long path {{which led to the}} door. There was no light and no sound from within. Half repenting of my temerity I shortened my stick and knocked lightly upon the door.|$|R
60|$|All this he boomed {{forth like}} a {{professor}} addressing his class. He had swung round his revolving chair so as to face me, and he sat all puffed out like an enormous bull-frog, his head laid back and his eyes half-covered by supercilious lids. Now he suddenly turned himself sideways, and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> of him was tangled hair with a red, protruding ear. He was scratching about among the litter of papers upon his desk. He faced me presently {{with what looked like}} a very tattered sketch-book in his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Drive? Good gracious! He scared us to death, except Castleton. Nothing could scare that cold-blooded little Englishman. I am dizzy yet. Do you know, Majesty, I {{was delighted}} when I saw the car. Then your cowboy driver met {{us at the}} platform. What a queer-looking individual! He had a big pistol {{strapped}} to those leather trousers. That made me nervous. When he piled us all in with our grips, he {{put me in the}} seat beside him, whether I liked it or not. I was fool enough to tell him I loved to travel fast. What do you think he said? Well, he eyed me in a rather cool and speculative way and said, with a smile, 'Miss, I reckon anything you love an' want bad will be coming to you out here!' I didn't know whether it was delightful candor or impudence. Then he said to all of us: 'Shore you had better wrap up in the veils an' dusters. It's a long, slow, hot, dusty ride to the ranch, an' Miss Hammond's order was to drive safe.' He got our baggage checks and gave them to a man with a huge wagon and a four-horse team. Then he cranked the car, jumped in, wrapped his arms round the wheel, and sank down low in his seat. There was a crack, a jerk, a kind of flash around us, and that dirty little town was somewhere on the map behind. For about five minutes I had a lovely time. Then the wind began to tear me to pieces. I couldn't hear anything but the rush of wind and roar of the car. I could see only straight ahead. What a road! I never saw a road in my life till to-day. Miles and miles and miles ahead, with not even a post or tree. That big car seemed to leap at the miles. It hummed and sang. I was fascinated, then terrified. We went so fast I couldn't catch my breath. The wind went through me, and I expected to be disrobed by it any minute. I was afraid I couldn't hold any clothes on. Presently <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> a flashing gray wall with a white line in the middle. Then my eyes blurred. My face burned. My ears grew full of a hundred thousand howling devils. I was about ready to die when the car stopped. I looked and looked, and when I could see, there you stood!" ...|$|E
6000|$|I learned, however, to my dismay, from a sympa- thizing but inexorable concierge, {{that what}} {{remained}} {{to me of}} the time I had to spend at Beaune, between trains, - I had rashly wasted {{half an hour of}} it in breakfasting at the station, - was the one hour of the day (that of the dinner of the nuns; the picture is in their refectory) during which the treasure could not be shown. The purpose of the musical chimes to which I had so artlessly listened was to usher in this fruitless interval. The regulation was absolute, and my disappointment relative, as I have been happy to reflect since I [...] "looked up" [...] the picture. Crowe and Cavalcaselle assign it without hesitation to Roger van der Weyden, and give a weak little drawing of it in their [...] "Flemish Painters." [...] I learn from them also - what I was ignorant of - that Nicholas Ronin, Chan- cellor of Burgundy and founder of the establishment at Beaune, was the original of the worthy kneeling before the Virgin, in the magnificent John van Eyck of the Salon Carre. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> the court of the hospital and two or three rooms. The court, with its tall roofs, its pointed gables and spires, its wooden galleries, its ancient well, with an elaborate superstruc- ture of wrought iron, is one of those places into which a sketcher ought to be let loose. It looked Flemish or English rather than French, and a splendid tidiness pervaded it. The porter took me into two rooms on the ground-floor, into which the sketcher should also be allowed to penetrate; for they made irresistible pictures. One of them, of great proportions, painted in elaborate [...] "subjects," [...] like a ball-room of the seven- teenth century, was filled with the beds of patients, all draped in curtains of dark red cloth, the tradi- tional uniform of these, eleemosynary couches. Among them the sisters moved about, in their robes of white flannel, with big white linen hoods. The other room was a strange, immense apartment, lately restored with much splendor. It was of great length and height, had a painted and gilded barrel-roof, and one end of it - the one I was introduced to - appeared to serve as a chapel, as two white-robed sisters were on their knees before an altar. This was divided by red curtains from the larger part; but the porter lifted one of the curtains, and showed me that the rest of it, a long, imposing vista, served as a ward, lined with little red-draped beds. [...] "C'est l'heure de la lecture," [...] remarked my guide; and a group of conva- lescents - all the patients I saw were women - were gathered in the centre around a nun, the points of whose white hood nodded a little above them, and whose gentle voice came to us faintly, with a little echo, down the high perspective. I know not what the good sister was reading, - a dull book, I am afraid, - but there was so much color, and such a fine, rich air of tradition about the whole place, that it seemed to me I would have risked listening to her. I turned away, however, with that sense of defeat which is always irritating to the appreciative tourist, and pot- tered about Beaune rather vaguely {{for the rest of my}} hour: looked at the statue of Gaspard Monge, the mathematician, in the little place (there is no place in France too little to contain an effigy to a glorious son); at the fine old porch - completely despoiled at the Revolution - of the principal church; and even at the meagre treasures of a courageous but melancholy little museum, which has been arranged - part of it being the gift of a local collector - in a small hotel de ville. I carried away from Beaune the impression of some- thing mildly autumnal, - something rusty yet kindly, like the taste of a sweet russet pear.|$|E
5000|$|It's {{very hard}} to be for genocide, or against people who are against genocide, but I couldn't see {{anything}} in that resolution that could prevent any single drop of blood being shed. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> that it was doing harm to the U.S., rather than to the perpetrators of the alleged genocide.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nope--they didn't hit it up very hard. But {{they laid}} foundations." [...] Of course, Steele {{was not to}} be seen last night. This morning Blome and his gang were out pretty early. But they {{traveled}} alone. Blome just strolled up and down by himself. I watched him walk up this street on one side and then down the other, just a matter of thirty-one times. I counted them. For <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> maybe Blome did not take a drink. But his gang, especially Bo Snecker, sure looked on the red liquor.|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes, sir; {{but it is}} just {{possible}} that they may have seen the smoke of this hut also, and be making their way here. Though I looked carefully on <b>all</b> sides <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> no other signs of life.” ...|$|R
6000|$|I called, [...] "Laura!"--at first softly, then {{louder and}} louder. No one {{answered}} {{and no one}} appeared. For <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> and hear, the only human creature in the neighbourhood {{of the lake and}} the plantation was myself.|$|R
