In secret, the Dutch {{military}} command, partly acting on its own accord, negotiated with both Belgium and France via the Dutch military attaché in Paris, Lieutenant-Colonel David van Voorst Evekink to coordinate a common defence to a German invasion.

500|$|In December 1636 {{the ministers}} met once again, but this meeting {{did not produce}} agreement, and Cotton warned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> sanctification {{becoming}} essentially a covenant of works. When questioned directly, Hutchinson accused the other ministers of preaching works and not grace, but did this only in private. These theological differences had begun to take their toll in the political aspects of the colony, and the Massachusetts governor, Henry Vane, who was a strong free grace advocate, announced his resignation to a special session of the deputies. While citing urgent matters back in England as being his reason for stepping down, when prodded, he broke down, blurting out his concern that God's judgment would [...] "come upon us for these differences and dissensions". The members of the Boston church successfully induced Vane to withdraw his resignation, while the General Court began to debate {{who was responsible for}} the colony's troubles. The General Court, like the remainder of the colony, was deeply divided, and called for a general fast to take place on 19 January in hopes that such repentance would restore peace.|$|E

2500|$|Heidegger claimed {{philosophy}} and science since ancient Greece had reduced things to their presence, {{which was a}} superficial way of understanding them. One crucial source of this insight was Heidegger's reading of Franz Brentano's treatise on Aristotle's manifold uses of the word [...] "being", a work which provoked Heidegger to ask what kind of unity underlies this multiplicity of uses. Heidegger opens his magnum opus, Being and Time, with a citation from Plato's Sophist indicating that Western philosophy has neglected Being because it was considered obvious, rather than as worthy of question. Heidegger's intuition <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> Being is thus a historical argument, which in his later work becomes his concern with the [...] "history of Being", that is, {{the history of the}} forgetting of Being, which according to Heidegger requires that philosophy retrace its footsteps through a productive destruction of the history of philosophy.|$|E

2500|$|In old age, Laplace {{remained}} curious <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> God {{and frequently}} discussed Christianity with the Swiss astronomer Jean-Frédéric-Théodore Maurice. He told Maurice that [...] "Christianity {{is quite a}} beautiful thing" [...] and praised its civilising influence. Maurice thought that the basis of Laplace's beliefs was, little by little, being modified, but that he held fast to his conviction that the invariability {{of the laws of}} nature did not permit of supernatural events. After Laplace's death, Poisson told Maurice, [...] "You know that I do not share your [...] opinions, but my conscience forces me to recount something that will surely please you." [...] When Poisson had complimented Laplace about his [...] "brilliant discoveries", the dying man had fixed him with a pensive look and replied, [...] "Ah! we chase after phantoms [...]" [...] These were his last words, interpreted by Maurice as a realisation of the ultimate [...] "vanity" [...] of earthly pursuits. Laplace received the last rites from the curé of the Missions Étrangères (in whose parish he was to be buried) and the curé of Arcueil.|$|E
2500|$|After waiting all day Wednesday (29 July) for a reply, Bethmann Hollweg [...] {{sent off}} three more telegrams {{urgently}} demanding an [...] "immediate" [...] answer to his ‘pledge plan’ {{and the plan}} for [...] "direct conversations" [...] between Austria and Russia and added in severe disapproval of Austria:"These expressions of the Austrian diplomats must be regarded as indications of more recent wishes and aspirations.

In St. Petersburg it declares its territorial disinterestedness; us it leaves wholly in the dark as to its programme; Rome it puts off with empty phrases <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> compensation; in London, Count Mensdorff (the Austrian ambassador) hands out part of Serbia to Bulgaria and Albania and places himself in contradiction with Vienna's solemn declaration at St. Petersburg. From these contradictions I must conclude that the telegram disavowing Hoyos {who, on July 5/6 at Berlin, had spoken unofficially of Austria's partitioning of Serbia} was intended for the gallery, and that the Austrian Government is harboring plans which it sees fit to conceal from us, in order to assure itself in all events of German support and to avoid the refusal which might result from a frank statement." ...|$|E

[...] Williams pointed out [...] "that although Catholics have for some time comprised the largest religious affiliation in both the Senate and {{the population as a}} whole, there has been only one Catholic Senate Chaplain since 1793, and not a single rabbi." [...] He noted [...] "Only eight denominations have been represented in the office." [...] In light of this Williams put forward Senate Resolution 90 which [...] "resulted in the Senate's decision to appoint a new chaplain annually, rather than let the incumbent serve for life." [...] The appointment would also [...] "rotate among the nation's three major religious groups." [...] When asked by reporters <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> Constitutionality raised by his citing Madison he replied [...] "If this were tested, I would say that it could go either way. It could be declared unconstitutional. Any taxpayer could question this, but no one ever has." [...] He held that in places where people were isolated by acts of government, such as people in the armed services, hospitals or prisons that chaplains serving them would be Constitutional, [...] "But, I don't know anybody less isolated than members of Congress." [...] In following eras the courts would rule on the constitutionality of the chaplaincy.|$|E
