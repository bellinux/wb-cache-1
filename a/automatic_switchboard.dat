25|$|The <b>automatic</b> {{telephone}} <b>switchboard</b> {{was introduced}} in 1892 along with dial telephones. By 1929, 31.9% of the Bell system was automatic. Automatic telephone switching originally used vacuum tube amplifiers and electro-mechanical switches, which consumed {{a large amount of}} electricity. Call volume eventually grew so fast that it was feared the telephone system would consume all electricity production, prompting Bell Labs to begin research on the transistor.|$|R

40|$|This master’s thesis {{has been}} {{conducted}} at SpeechCraft, a company that mainly works with the product Prego which is an <b>automatic</b> <b>switchboard</b> based upon speech recognition. Prego is developed with speech recognition services provided by Nuance Communications Inc. One of these services is called Autopron which is an automatic pronunciation generator and which supplies phonetic transcriptions from graphically written input. However, the transcriptions generated by Autopron do not represent proper names well; especially not foreign proper names. Therefore {{the purpose of this}} thesis has been to develop a “new ” Autopron based upon Swedish subjects ’ pronuciation variations of foreign names. The foreign languages that were selected for this thesis are Finnish and Serbo-Croatian. Ten subjects were chosen to record a set of Finnish and Serbo-Croatian names. Pronunciation rules were developed based upon the subjects ’ pronuciation variations. These rules were then used to create the LottaPron program implemented in Perl. The program that has been developed takes a foreign name as input and produces several different pronunciation variations as output. This automatic pronunciation generator is, in the long run, intended t...|$|E

50|$|As {{telephone}} exchanges converted to <b>automatic</b> (dial) service, <b>switchboards</b> continued to serve specialized purposes.

Elsewhere, the subscriber would ask the local operator to ring the long-distance operator.|$|R
40|$|The {{telephone}} system was not sufficiently developed in prewar Japan. This study examines the technological development of <b>automatic</b> telephone <b>switchboard</b> (ATS) {{to clarify the}} problems of {{telephone system}} in prewar Japan. Ministry of Communication(MOC) introduced automatic telephone system in 1923. From {{the standpoint of the}} telephone exchange service, it was a very opportune decision; however, it was technologically premature. Although they had conducted research on the system before WW 1, their only choice was the primitive S ~ S system. Further, the dependence on import technology caused different A-type and H-type ATS to coexist. Each local telephone exchange district independently introduced a different type. The MOC had to prepare the specifications and parts for repair for two different systems. These factors hampered the improvement of the telecommunication quality. Standardizing the system by using independent technology became the biggest issue for the MOC in the 1930 s. In the 1930 s, some joint researches were organized with private enterprises. They tried to develop a gT-typeh or gElectronic Tube-typeh ATS. However, the T-type ATS was merely an improvement over the outdated S ~ S system with respect to the circuit design. On the other hand, Matsumae aimed at a novel technology, an electronic common control system. However, a suitable electronic tube was not invented. As a result, the telecommunication industry was unable to resolve the coexistence problem in the prewar period. However, the engineers of MOC and ATS suppliers recognized their technological backwardness and shared an awareness of the importance of standardization by independent technology. This was the starting point for the research and development system of the telecommunication industry in gPostwar Japan. hTelephone system, <b>Automatic</b> Telephone <b>Switchboard,</b> Ministry of Communication, Research & Development, Joint Research...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we present {{technology}} used in spoken dialog systems for applications {{of a wide}} range. They include tasks from the travel domain and <b>automatic</b> <b>switchboards</b> as well as large scale directory assistance. The overall goal in developing spoken dialog systems is {{to allow for a}} natural and flexible dialog flow similar to human–human interaction. This imposes the challenging task to recognize and interpret user input, where he/she is allowed to choose from an unrestricted vocabulary and an infinite set of possible formulations. We therefore put emphasis on strategies that make the system more robust while still maintaining a high level of naturalness and flexibility. In view of this paradigm, we found that two fundamental principles characterize many of the proposed methods: 1) to consider available sources of information as early as possible, and 2) to keep alternative hypotheses and delay the decision for a single option as long as possible. We describe how our system architecture caters to incorporating application specific knowledge, including, for example, database constraints, in the determination of the best sentence hypothesis for a user turn. On the next higher level, we use the dialog history to assess the plausibility of a sentence hypothesis by applying consistency checks with information items from previous user turns. In particular, we demonstrate how combination decisions over several turns can be exploited to boost the recognition performance of the system. The dialog manager can also use information on the dialog flow to dynamically modify and tune the system for the specific dialog situations. An important means to increase the “intelligence” of a spoken dialog system is to use confidence measures. We propose methods to obtain confidence measures for semantic items, whole sentences and even full N-best lists and give examples for the benefits obtained from their application. Experiences from field tests with our systems are summarized that have been found crucial for the system acceptance.

40|$|The Philips <b>automatic</b> {{telephone}} <b>switchboard</b> and {{directory information}} system PADIS provides a natural-language user interface to a telephone directory database. Using speech recognition and language understanding technologies, the system offers phone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses, and room numbers {{as well as}} direct call completion to a desired party. In this paper, we present the underlying probabilistic framework, the system architecture, and the individual modules for speech recognition, language understanding, dialogue control, and speech output. In addition, we report results on performance and user behaviour obtained from a field test in our research lab with a 600 -entry database. We derive a new maximum-a-posteriori decision rule which incorporates database knowledge and dialogue history as constraints in speech recognition and language understanding. It has improved speech understanding accuracy by 19 % (in terms of concept error rate), and reduced attribute substitution errors (e. g. recognition of a wrong name) by 38 %. The decision rule is implemented in a multi-stage approach as a combination of state-of-the-art speech recognition, partial parsing with an attributed stochastic context-free grammar, and an N-best algorithm which is also described in this paper.

Then we show that even more accurate CNNs can be trained {{under the guidance of}} LSTMs using a variant of model compression, which we call model blending because the teacher and student models are similar in complexity but different in inductive bias. Blending further improves the accuracy of our CNN, yielding a computationally efficient model of accuracy higher {{than any of the other}} individual models. Examining the effect of "dark knowledge" in this model compression task, we find that less than 1 % of the highest probability labels are needed for accurate model compression...|$|R
