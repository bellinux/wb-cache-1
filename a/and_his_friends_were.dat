5|$|Galileo's {{dispute with}} Grassi {{permanently}} alienated {{many of the}} Jesuits who had previously been sympathetic to his ideas, and Galileo <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> convinced that these Jesuits were responsible for bringing about his later condemnation. The evidence for this is at best equivocal, however.|$|E
5|$|Pericles <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> never {{immune from}} attack, as preeminence in {{democratic}} Athens was not equivalent to absolute rule. Just before {{the eruption of}} the Peloponnesian War, Pericles {{and two of his}} closest associates, Phidias and his companion, Aspasia, faced a series of personal and judicial attacks.|$|E
5|$|Flanagan's early {{influences}} included Art Tatum and Teddy Wilson, {{both of whom}} {{he heard}} on the radio and playing in the Detroit area, as well as Nat King Cole and local pianists Earl Van Riper and Willie Anderson. These, however, played in an earlier style, and the young Flanagan <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> more interested in the newer bebop, including that played by pianist Bud Powell, who had a strong effect on Flanagan's musical thinking and improvising.|$|E

Following the tale's publication, a child fan wrote Potter {{suggesting}} Jeremy find a wife. Potter responded {{with a series of}} miniature letters on the theme as if from Jeremy and his pals. After Potter's death in 1943, licences were issued to various firms to produce the Potter characters. Jeremy <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> released as porcelain figurines, plush toys, and other merchandise.|$|E
5|$|Priestley's {{attempts}} to avoid political {{controversy in the}} United States failed. In 1794, the journalist William Cobbett published Observations on the Emigration of Dr. Joseph Priestley, which falsely accused Priestley of stirring up rebellion in Britain, and attempted to undermine his scientific credibility. His political fortunes took an even worse turn when Cobbett obtained a set of letters sent to Priestley by the radical printer John Hurford Stone and the liberal novelist Helen Maria Williams. Cobbett published the letters in his newspaper, asserting that Priestley <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> fomenting a revolution. Priestley was eventually forced to defend himself in print.|$|E
5|$|Nurmi {{was born}} in Turku, Finland, to {{carpenter}} Johan Fredrik Nurmi and his wife Matilda Wilhelmiina Laine. Nurmi's siblings, Siiri, Saara, Martti and Lahja, were born in 1898, 1902, 1905 and 1908, respectively. In 1903, the Nurmi family moved from Raunistula into a 40-square-meter apartment in central Turku, where Paavo Nurmi would live until 1932. The young Nurmi <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> inspired by the English long-distance runner Alfred Shrubb. They regularly ran or walked six kilometres (four miles) to swim in Ruissalo, and back, sometimes twice a day. By the age of eleven, Nurmi ran the 1500 metres in 5:02. Nurmi's father Johan died in 1910 and his sister Lahja a year later. The family struggled financially, renting out their kitchen to another family {{and living in a}} single room. Nurmi, a talented student, left school to work as an errand boy for a bakery. Although he stopped running actively, he got plenty of exercise pushing heavy carts up the steep slopes in Turku. He later credited these climbs for strengthening his back and leg muscles.|$|E

Even so, {{it could be argued}} that the influence of his father Edwin <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> just as important. Huxley was a close friend of the family, and whilst still a child Ray met Hooker, Henfrey, Clifford, Gosse, Owen, Forbes, Carpenter, Lyell, Murchison, Henslow and Darwin.|$|E

While he <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> too late to stop the Threshold from destroying every single spacecraft in the universe, {{they were able to}} bring about the organisation's destruction before it could profit. Fey returned to her time, having also bonded with Shayde to save his life.|$|E

25|$|The first {{recorded}} nutritional experiment with human subjects {{is found in}} the Bible's Book of Daniel. Daniel <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> captured by the king of Babylon during an invasion of Israel. Selected as court servants, they were to share in the king's fine foods and wine. But they objected, preferring vegetables (pulses) and water in accordance with their Jewish dietary restrictions. The king's chief steward reluctantly agreed to a trial. Daniel and his friends received their diet for ten days and were then compared to the king's men. Appearing healthier, they were allowed to continue with their diet.|$|E
25|$|Three hooded men, one tall, one medium-size, and one short, {{robbed a}} stagecoach near Wickenburg. Six men, {{including}} the driver, were shot and killed. Among them was Frederick Wadsworth Loring, a young writer from Boston {{who had been}} sent as a correspondent for Appleton's Journal. The incident {{became known as the}} Wickenburg Massacre. On one occasion Mr. Swilling <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> in a bar discussing the incident and the description of the murderers, Mr. Swilling jokingly mentioned that he and his friends matched the description. Mr. Swilling and his companions became suspects in the robbery.|$|E
25|$|After lengthy preparations, {{the fleet}} {{was ready to}} sail. The night before they were to leave, someone {{destroyed}} many of the hermai—the stone markers representing Hermes, placed around the city for good luck. This event was taken very seriously by the Athenian people as it was considered a bad omen for the expedition, as well as evidence of a revolutionary conspiracy to overthrow the government. According to Plutarch, Androcles, a political enemy of Alcibiades, used false witness to claim that Alcibiades <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> responsible. Alcibiades volunteered {{to be put on}} trial under penalty of death in order to prove his innocence (wanting to avoid his enemies charging him, in his absence, with more false information), but this request was denied.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the next}} twenty-two days, the four conspirators fled {{through the small}} streets and little holes that they could find, trying to escape from Guatemala City, but the {{government}} surrounded the city and slowly tightened the perimeter while combing every inch of terrain. The conspirators' families were incarcerated and prosecuted. Others conspirators, brothers Juan and Adolfo Viteri and Francisco Valladares, were arrested when they attempted to flee disguised as women in Guastatoya. Others, like Felipe and Rafael Prado Romaña, tried to flee to El Salvador, but were captured when someone informed on them. The Romaña brothers remained imprisoned until their death. Only the Colombian Rafael Madriñán escaped the country on a bicycle. The mother of the Romaña brothers took the Mexican Ambassador, Federico Camboa, to {{the house where the}} Avila Echeverría brothers <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> hiding, who, knowing that they had only days to live, gave him all their valuables and begged him to pass them on to their relatives.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before their}} graduation, Valdobrev <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> {{very active in}} acting or staging in {{professional}} theatres like the Academy Drama Theatre or the Youth Theatre. Such kick-start performances as Sam Shepard's Angel City, Georg Buchner's Leonce and Lena, William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, Aeschylus' Agamemnon, Goran Stefanovski's Black Hole, Chekhov Revue and others appeared between 1991 and 1993. In June, 1993 Valdobrev {{became a member of}} the troupe of the National Theatre, but some time later he had to start serving his 12 months' mandatory military service, so eventually moved to the Bulgarian Army Theatre (actually, a civil repertory theatre sponsored by the Ministry of Defense, with a leading status in the cultural life). He spent there 10 years, taking part in many significant performances like Georg Buchner's Woyzeck, Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing, Eric Bogosian's Suburbia and Jean Anouilh's Eurydice. In 1997 the independent theatre company La Strada, formed by the popular director Tedi Moskov produced three major hit performances in collaboration with the Bulgarian Army Theatre: The Master and Margarita (presented at the official selection of the Avignon Theatre Festival), Commedia del Servitore (a co-production with the Avignon Theatre Festival) and Fantasmagorii. As one of the cast Valdobrev spent the next five years touring and presenting the plays at the most prestigious European theatre festivals.|$|E

[...] However, after similar information was brought by respected chiefs, the Cheyenne started posting good lookouts. Soon Wooden Leg <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> in a skirmish with a party of soldiers. [...] In the subsequent ongoing fighting of the Great Sioux War of 1876–77, Wooden Leg took part in nearly every major engagement.|$|E
500|$|Bauer <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> {{part of a}} {{generation}} of Swedish painters who started their careers just before the Modernism movement began to flourish, {{but at the same}} time were considerably younger than those dominating the Swedish art scene: artists such as Carl Larsson, Anders Zorn and Bruno Liljefors. Bauer was inspired by these artists, but from his heritage [...] came in contact with Fritz Erler, Max Klinger and other German illustrators. He lived in an era when the Old Norse were romanticized throughout Scandinavia, and borrowed ideas and motifs from artists like Theodor Kittelsen and Erik Werenskiöld, yet his finished works were in his own style. [...] After his journey to Italy his works clearly showed elements from the 14th century Renaissance. The pictures of princes and princesses had elements from Flandic tapestries, and even the trolls garments were pleated, much like the draped clothing seen in antique Roman sculptures.|$|E

Bart and Lisa, as well as the other children of Springfield, are annoyed with not being allowed out after sunset. The children soon rally together to rebel and see an old drive-in horror movie which they saw advertised on television, called [...] "The Bloodening", a film recently discovered in a concrete vault after it was deemed too violent. While at the movie, the movie was interrupted as they are caught by Chief Wiggum. As a punishment, the children must clean a police billboard with Wiggum on it.|$|E
