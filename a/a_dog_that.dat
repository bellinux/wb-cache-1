5|$|Ale were {{believed}} {{to be able to make}} men insane; in eastern Serbia there is a special term for such a man: alosan. When people encountered an ala on a road or field, they could get dangerous diseases from her. Ale are also responsible for dogs’ rabies, although indirectly: a skylark that reaches the clouds and encounters an ala there goes mad (alosan), plunges to the ground, and so kills itself; <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>that</b> finds and eats the bird goes mad too.|$|E
5|$|Bryce learns {{about the}} tunnel from his cellmate, {{and the two}} escape again. Emerging from the tunnel, they are met by Butler and <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>that</b> attacks Bryce. After being {{brought back to the}} farmhouse, Bryce is told to accept that he is mediocre and ordinary. Elsewhere, Black and Watts {{interview}} Roe again, who seems to espouse the same mindset. Black reveals that he knows Roe was once a promising student, and accuses her of being cowed by a fear of failure. Frightened, she reveals the location of Butler's farm. Police raid the farm, freeing several captive youths, including Bryce, but Butler is nowhere to be found.|$|E
5|$|Developed in the United States, the American Water Spaniel is the Wisconsin state dog. The breed {{originated}} in the areas along the Fox River and its tributary the Wolf River during the early 19th century. Hunters needed <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>that</b> could work on both land and water, a versatile hunter skilled at bringing {{in a variety of}} game. Hunters also wanted a hunting dog compact enough to be transported in a small skiff, one that was able to withstand Wisconsin's cold water temperatures. Breeds involved {{in the creation of the}} American Water Spaniel are thought to have included the English Water Spaniel, Irish Water Spaniel, Curly Coated Retriever, native Indian Dogs, the Poodle, and either the Sussex Spaniel or another type of field spaniel.|$|E

5|$|They were unpopular with sportsmen as {{the dark}} colours of the breed {{did not show}} up in hunting conditions, and the {{elongated}} and short shape of the early breed was not very practical for moving easily through cover. The low-slung variety of Field Spaniel were developed by Phineas Bullock from dogs previously owned by Sir Francis Burdett, the secretary of the Birmingham Dog Show. Burdett was said to have owned a variety of black Cocker Spaniels. Bullock crossed the Field Spaniel with the Sussex Spaniel and the English Water Spaniel. In the 1870s he was very successful in the show ring with his variety of Field Spaniel; however, it resulted in <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>that</b> was almost exactly like a Sussex Spaniel {{with the exception of the}} head itself.|$|E

25|$|Dogs {{were often}} used to carry {{messages}} in battle. They would be turned loose to move silently to a second handler.

Some messenger dogs also performed other communication jobs, such as pulling telephone lines from one location to another.|$|E

25|$|The dog {{of tears}} is <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>that</b> joins {{the small group}} of blind when they leave the quarantine.

25|$|The fourteenth 13-day {{period of}} the tonalpohualli ritual {{calendar}} started with the day ce itzcuintli (1-dog) and people, especially rulers, were fated to be especially lucky if born on this day. The tenth day of the xiuhpohualli 20-day agricultural calendar, itzcuintli (dog), was governed by Mictlantecuhtli, the grim lord of the dead. In the Postclassic, when an Aztec commoner died he had to pass through each of the nine levels of Mictlan, the underworld. Mictlan was only reached {{after four years of}} wandering, accompanied by <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>that</b> had been cremated with the deceased. The first level of Mictlan was called Apanoayan (where one crosses the river), this place was also known as Itzcuintlan (the Place of Dogs) because of the many dogs that roamed the near shore. <b>A</b> <b>dog</b> <b>that</b> recognised its former owner would carry him across the river on its back. In some accounts, the dogs on the shore act differently according to their colour, yellow dogs would carry the soul of the deceased across the river, while white dogs refuse because they have just washed themselves and black dogs refuse because either they have just swum the river or because they are dirty.|$|E

25|$|The less usual Wirehaired Vizsla is a {{completely}} separate breed from its more commonly seen smooth-coated cousin. The Wirehaired Vizsla {{was developed in the}} 1930s, initially by Vasas Jozsef, owner of the Csabai vizsla kennel along with Gresznarik Laszlo, who owned the de Selle German Wirehaired Pointer kennel. Their aim was to produce <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>that</b> combined the color of the Vizsla with a heavier coat, and a more substantial frame, better suited for working in cold weather and retrieving from icy water.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>dog</b> <b>that</b> completes a {{championship}} (called a finished champion) {{may continue to}} be entered in shows to compete for Group (winner of its group) or Best In Show (BIS) honors. A finished dog that continues to compete is called a special.

Many prestigious shows only accept entries from dogs that have finished their championships.|$|E
25|$|The {{veneer of}} civilization is thin and fragile, writes Doctorow, {{and in the}} story London exposes the {{brutality}} {{at the core of}} humanity and the ease with which humans revert to a state of primitivism. His interest in Marxism is evident in the sub-theme that humanity is motivated by materialism; and his interest in Nietzschean philosophy is shown by Buck's characterization. Gianquitto writes that in Buck's characterization, London created a type of Nietschean Übermensch — in this case <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>that</b> reaches mythic proportions.|$|E

25|$|The Wolfhound was {{historically}} <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>that</b> only nobles could own and {{was taken}} up by the British during their rule in Ireland. This made it unpopular as a national symbol and the Kerry Blue Terrier was adopted by Republicans such as Michael Collins.The Wolfhound has been adopted as a symbol by both rugby codes. The national rugby league team is nicknamed the Wolfhounds, and the Irish Rugby Football Union, which governs rugby union, changed the name of the country's A (second-level) national team in that code to the Ireland Wolfhounds in 2010.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>dog</b> <b>that</b> {{successfully}} recovers from CPV2 generally remains contagious for up {{to three}} weeks, but it is possible they may remain contagious {{for up to}} six. Ongoing infection risk is primarily from fecal contamination of the environment due to the virus's ability to survive many months in the environment. Neighbours and family members with dogs should be notified of infected animals so that they can ensure that their dogs are vaccinated or tested for immunity. The vaccine will take up to 2 weeks to reach effective levels of immunity; the contagious individual should remain in quarantine until other animals are protected.|$|E
25|$|Peanuts had {{its origin}} in Li'l Folks, a weekly panel comic that {{appeared}} in Schulz's hometown paper, the St. Paul Pioneer Press, from 1947 to 1950. He first used the name Charlie Brown for a character there, although he applied the name in four gags to three different boys and one buried in sand. The series also had <b>a</b> <b>dog</b> <b>that</b> looked much like the early 1950s version of Snoopy. In 1948, Schulz sold a cartoon to The Saturday Evening Post which published 17 single-panel cartoons by Schulz. The first of these was of a boy sitting with his feet on an ottoman.|$|E
