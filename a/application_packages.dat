40|$|Abstract: <b>Application</b> <b>packaging</b> bundles <b>applications</b> and {{compatibility}} patch {{for operating}} systems {{into a single}} file called a distribution unit (. msi), which {{makes it easier to}} deploy and install them on user's computers. Packaging reduces the total cost of ownership (TCO) for the customers by enabling them to efficiently install and configure the applications. This results in an <b>application</b> <b>package,</b> which provides the product with newer capabilities like advertising features without installing them, installing products on demand, add user customizations etc. Now a days there is new development in this technology i. e., Application virtualization which has been introduced. In this paper we have presented architecture and process of <b>application</b> <b>packaging,</b> its advantages and how it also reduces the overall cost...|$|R
