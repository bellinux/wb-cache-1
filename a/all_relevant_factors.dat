If 250 were used, for instance, instead of 235, it is unlikely that the target would be more than two or three runs different.' ...|$|E

It is not sufficient to allow the defendant to present mitigating factors during the trial if those factors are not considered in the sentencing. If the jury is not instructed to consider <b>all</b> <b>relevant</b> mitigating <b>factors,</b> the defendant's Eighth Amendment rights are violated as failure to do so constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.

40|$|There is {{a renewed}} {{interest}} in weak model sets due to their connection to B-free systems, which emerged from Sarnak's program on the Möbius disjointness conjecture. Here we continue our recent investigation [arXiv: 1511. 06137] of the dynamical system M^ G_ W associated to a weak model set in a group G with window W. As a result, we identify the maximal equicontinuous factor of M^ G_ W and give a sufficient condition when M^ G_ W is an almost extension of its maximal equicontinuous factor. If the window has positive Haar measure, the system M^ G_ W equipped with its Mirsky measure is isomorphic to its Kronecker factor. For general nontrivial ergodic probability measures on M^ G_ W, we provide a kind of lower bound for the Kronecker <b>factor.</b> <b>All</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>factor</b> systems are natural G-actions on quotient subgroups of the torus underlying the weak model set. These are obtained by factoring out suitable window periods. These results are also interpreted for B-free systems...|$|R

In each case, the scope of the inquiry must be tailored to the particular dangers presented by the evidence and limited to determining the evidentiary question of admissibility.|$|E
