Technological innovations {{have the potential}} to increase efficiency and reduce costs. British Library produces a bibliographic database of allied and complementary medicine (AMED). This study compares articles which have been indexed manually for AMED with the same documents submitted to an <b>automated</b> <b>indexing</b> <b>tool.</b> The indexing tool selected was Helping Interdisciplinary Vocabulary Engineering, (HIVE) which is a jointly funded project by the University of North Carolina and the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center, North Carolina. A random selection of 100 records from a total of 1059 articles was selected. Each manually indexed document was compared with results returned by HIVE. Data analysis was made using SPSS. Results showed that HIVE does not provide a suitable replacement for the skills of a human indexer. Continued development of automatic indexing tools is recommended...|$|E

40|$|The index {{selection}} problem is NP-Complete and therefore requires heuristic to be used. Heuristic {{must be based}} on the query optimizer principles because the indices decided should be usable by the query optimizer. It should be noted that since the query optimization principles of commercial DBMSs vary to a great extent, it is infeasible to implement a general purpose <b>index</b> selection <b>tool.</b> We present a tool MAESTRO 7 (METU <b>Automated</b> <b>indEx</b> Selection <b>Tool</b> foR Oracle 7) that assists the database administrator in designing an index configuration for a given database application for Oracle 7. It decides on the complete set of indices both primary and secondary by considering the index maintenance costs. MAESTRO 7 automatically derives valid SQL statements and their usage statistics during regular database sessions through SQL Trace Facility. It classifies the SQL statements that will produce the same execution plan and accumulates their weights. MAESTRO 7 also decides on plausible columns for indexing at the beginning, before the more time consuming processing on the queries start, to improve performance of the tool. The selection of primary indices cannot be done independently for each table for multi table queries. Therefore in choosing primary indices, all combinations of plausible primary indices are considered. The benefit of using the indices are calculated by obtaining the cost of executing the queries from the query optimizer. Although this tool is specific to Oracle 7, a similar tool for any DBMS that has a cost based optimizer can be developed very easily following the ideas presented in this paper. I...|$|R

40|$|In {{contrast}} to {{other kinds of}} libraries, software libraries need to be conceptually organized. When looking for a component, the main concern of users is the functionality of the desired component; implementation details are secondary. Software reuse would be enhanced with conceptually organized large libraries of software components. In this paper, we present GURU, a tool that allows automatical building of such large software libraries from documented software components. We focus here on GURU's indexing component which extracts conceptual attributes from natural language documentation. This indexing method is based on words' co-occurrences. It first uses EXTRACT, a co-occurrence knowledge compiler for extracting potential attributes from textual documents. Conceptually relevant collocations are then selected according to their resolving power, which scales down the noise due to context words. This fully <b>automated</b> <b>indexing</b> <b>tool</b> thus goes further than keyword-based tools {{in the understanding of}} a document without the brittleness of knowledge based tools. The indexing component of GURU is fully implemented, and some results are given in the paper...|$|E
40|$|Health and {{functional}} status data {{have been shown}} to have clinical utility in predicting outcome. Various metadata registries in the form of patient self-administered health assessment questionnaires have been incorporated into routine clinical care and clinical research of patients with rheumatic disease. Examples of such health assessment instruments are the Clinical Health Assessment Questionnaire (CLINHAQ) and the Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (MHAQ). These instruments contain concepts that {{are an integral part of}} the health {{and functional}} status domain. Using an <b>automated</b> <b>indexing</b> <b>tool</b> we examined the clinical content coverage by SNOMED RT and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus for health and functional status concepts identified in the MHAQ and CLINHAQ. Significant differences existed between the overall representational ability of SNOMED and UMLS for concepts identified in the MHAQ (49 %, vs. 77 % respectively, p <. 005) and for concepts identified in the CLINHAQ (30 % vs. 64 % respectively p <. 005). Representational capability by SNOMED-RT and UMLS for concepts in a given health assessment instrument was carried across four semantic classes of "attitudes", "symptoms", "activities", and "social attributes". The conceptual content coverage of health status assessment concepts contained in the MHAQ and CLINHAQ by SNOMED-RT and UMLS was incomplete but better for UMLS with its panoply of vocabulary sources. This observed overall improved representation by UMLS appeared to be due to better representation of concepts in "activities" and "social attributes" semantic classes. Representation of health or functional status concepts in a computerized medical record should be founded on a universally agreed concept model of that domain. Established functional and health status metadata registries can serve as important sources for concepts and candidate classes within that domain...|$|E

For this study, 244 transcribed TOEFL speech samples taken from 244 L 2 learners were analyzed using <b>automated</b> <b>indices</b> taken from Coh-Metrix, CPIDR, and LIWC. A stepwise linear regression was used to explain the variance in human judgments of independent speaking ability and overall speaking proficiency. <b>Automated</b> <b>indices</b> related to word type counts, causal cohesion, and lexical diversity predicted 52 % {{of the variance in}} human ratings for the independent speech samples. <b>Automated</b> <b>indices</b> related to word type counts and word frequency predicted 61 % of the variance of the human scores of overall speaking proficiency.

40|$|Abstract—Modern {{traceability}} tools employ information re-trieval (IR) {{methods to}} generate candidate traceability links. These methods track textual signs {{embedded in the}} system to establish relationships between software artifacts. However, as software systems evolve, new and inconsistent terminology finds {{its way into the}} system’s taxonomy, thus corrupting its lexical structure and distorting its traceability tracks. In this paper, we argue that the distorted lexical tracks of the system can be systematically re-established through refactoring, a set of behavior-preserving transformations for keeping the system qual-ity under control during evolution. To test this novel hypothesis, we investigate the effect of integrating various types of refactoring on the performance of requirements-to-code automated tracing methods. In particular, we identify the problems of missing, misplaced, and duplicated signs in software artifacts, and then ex-amine to what extent refactorings that restore, move, and remove textual information can overcome these problems respectively. We conduct our experimental analysis using three datasets from different application domains. Results show that restoring textual information in the system has a positive impact on tracing. In contrast, refactorings that remove redundant information impact tracing negatively. Refactorings that move information among the system modules are found to have no significant effect. Our findings address several issues related to code and requirements evolution, as well as refactoring as a mechanism to enhance the practicality of <b>automated</b> tracing <b>tools.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Refactoring, traceability, information retrieval.

40|$|While {{the problem}} of Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) and <b>automated</b> image <b>indexing</b> systems has been widely studied in the past years they still {{represent}} a chal-lenging research field.

40|$|<b>Automated</b> <b>indexing</b> – using a {{computer}} to look at individual documents and assign metadata without a person looking at every document– was used to build an interactive online database to store and retrieve pages from a looseleaf resource (i. e., a resource which changes state over time).

Digitization, optical character recognition, and computer scripting to extract metadata were the methods used to assign most metadata. In places where the computer program could not assign metadata, a person looking at the document assigned metadata. The index was audited for errors.
