5|$|Without treatment, {{an acute}} {{attack of gout}} usually {{resolves}} in five to seven days; however, 60% of people have a second attack within one year. Those with gout are <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome and kidney and cardiovascular disease and thus are <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of death. It is unclear whether medications that lower urate affect cardiovascular disease risks. This may be partly due to its association with insulin resistance and obesity, {{but some of the}} increased risk appears to be independent.|$|E
5|$|A multi-locus genetic {{risk score}} study {{based on a}} {{combination}} of 27 loci, including the APOA5 gene, identified individuals <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> for both incident and recurrent coronary artery disease events, as well as an enhanced clinical benefit from statin therapy. The study was based on a community cohort study (the Malmo Diet and Cancer study) and four additional randomized controlled trials of primary prevention cohorts (JUPITER and ASCOT) and secondary prevention cohorts (CARE and PROVE IT-TIMI 22).|$|E
5|$|Farm {{animals such as}} {{cows and}} horses as well as pet animals are also {{susceptible}} {{to the effects of}} lead toxicity. Sources of lead exposure in pets can be the same as those that present health threats to humans sharing the environment, such as paint and blinds, and there is sometimes lead in toys made for pets. Lead poisoning in a pet dog may indicate that children in the same household are <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> for elevated lead levels.|$|E
5000|$|Coastal {{areas are}} <b>at</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>risk</b> from sea-level rise and storm surge. Sea-level rise and storm surge place many U.S. coastal areas <b>at</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>risk</b> of erosion and flooding, {{especially}} along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, Pacific Islands, {{and parts of}} Alaska. Energy and transportation infrastructure and other property in coastal areas are very likely to be adversely affected.|$|R

5|$|In 2011, mantas became {{strictly}} {{protected in}} international waters {{because of their}} inclusion in the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals. The CMS is an international treaty organization concerned with conserving migratory species and habitats on a global scale. Although individual nations were already protecting manta rays, the fish often migrate through unregulated waters, putting them <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> from overfishing. The IUCN declared M. birostris to be 'Vulnerable with an elevated risk of extinction' in November 2011.|$|E
5|$|Persons with {{spinal cord}} injury are <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> for urinary tract {{infection}} in part because of chronic use of catheter, and in part because of voiding dysfunction. It is {{the most common cause of}} infection in this population, as well as the most common cause of hospitalization. Additionally, use of cranberry juice or cranberry supplement appears to be ineffective in prevention and treatment in this population.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other factors are less closely linked to COPD. The risk is greater in those who are poor, {{although}} it is not clear if this is due to poverty itself or other risk factors associated with poverty, such as air pollution and malnutrition. There is tentative evidence that those with asthma and airway hyperreactivity are <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of COPD. Birth factors such as low birth weight may also play a role as do a number of infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Respiratory infections such as pneumonia do not appear to increase the risk of COPD, at least in adults.|$|E

30|$|One {{activity}} that appears ubiquitous {{in terms of}} increasing oxidative stress is the ingestion of high-fat meals (McCarthy et al. 2013). Considering that many individuals consume such meals on a regular basis, they may exist in a prolonged postprandial state and place themselves <b>at</b> <b>increase</b> <b>risk</b> for disease (Ceriello et al. 2002; Zilversmit 1979).|$|R
5|$|Preterm newborns {{are known}} to be at higher risk for bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} with extended exposure to high concentrations of oxygen. Other groups at higher risk for oxygen toxicity are patients on mechanical ventilation with exposure to levels of oxygen greater than 50%, and patients exposed to chemicals that increase risk for oxygen toxicity such the chemotherapeutic agent bleomycin. Therefore, current guidelines for patients on mechanical ventilation in intensive care recommends keeping oxygen concentration less than 60%. Likewise, divers who undergo treatment of decompression sickness are <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of oxygen toxicity as treatment entails exposure to long periods of oxygen breathing under hyperbaric conditions, in addition to any oxygen exposure during the dive.|$|E
5|$|Reactive {{attachment}} disorder {{first made}} its appearance in standard nosologies of psychological disorders in DSM-III, 1980, following {{an accumulation of}} evidence on institutionalized children. The criteria included a requirement of onset {{before the age of}} 8 months and was equated with failure to thrive. Both these features were dropped in DSM-III-R, 1987. Instead, onset was changed to being within the first 5 years of life and the disorder itself was divided into two subcategories, inhibited and disinhibited. These changes resulted from further research on maltreated and institutionalized children and remain in the current version, DSM-IV, 1994, and its 2000 text revision, DSM-IV-TR, as well as in ICD-10, 1992. Both nosologies focus on young children who are not merely <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> for subsequent disorders but are already exhibiting clinical disturbance.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{orphaned}} children in Malawi {{has increased dramatically}} since the HIV/AIDS epidemic began in 1985, with certain surveys indicating that more than 35% of schoolchildren have experienced the death {{of at least one}} parent due to HIV/AIDS. Because HIV is transmitted sexually, married couples who engage in unprotected sexual relations put their children <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of becoming double orphans, or children who have lost both parents to HIV/AIDS. Older children who have lost both parents to HIV/AIDS often become responsible for the care of their younger siblings, and many double orphans drop out of school or migrate to urban areas to try to support themselves and their siblings. Girls who have been orphaned by HIV/AIDS have unusually high rates of school absenteeism in Malawi.|$|E
40|$|In {{the absence}} of a routine ovarian {{screening}} programme, ovarian cancer symptom awareness is a potential route to earlier symptomatic presentation and disease diagnosis. However, materials to support this strategy may need to be tailored according to risk. The work presented in this thesis identified the contributors to anticipated symptomatic presentation for women <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> genetic <b>risk</b> of ovarian cancer. A mixed-method approach was used to identify determinants of anticipated symptomatic presentation, and included a systematic search of existing ovarian cancer symptom awareness tools, cross-sectional surveys with two risk populations and qualitative interviews with women <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> genetic <b>risk.</b> Additionally, a systematic search and a virtual reference group were used to identify symptom content. Cognitive interviews were undertaken to pilot the draft tool for acceptability and usability with a sample of potential users and providers. Endorsing more benefits than barriers to presentation was associated with earlier anticipated presentation in both risk populations; however, differential effects of underlying health beliefs on anticipated presentation were also identified. In those <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> genetic <b>risk,</b> emotional (worry) rather than cognitive aspects of risk perception predominate in influencing earlier anticipated presentation. Interviews with women <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> genetic <b>risk</b> revealed that personal experience with ovarian cancer shaped beliefs about the disease. The identified health beliefs were incorporated into OvSTAT (ovarian cancer symptom awareness tool), with core content applicable for women from the general population and tailored content to address the specific needs of women <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> genetic <b>risk.</b> OvSTAT was well received in user testing. Overall, the findings suggest that the emotional representation of risk distinguishes earlier anticipated presentation in women <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> genetic <b>risk</b> from that in the general population. OvSTAT could be a mechanism through which appropriate symptomatic presentation is improved, by helping women to manage worry associated with their <b>increased</b> genetic <b>risk</b> status...|$|R

5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, {{scientists}} with the U.S. Public Health Service published reports about radioactivity released from Hanford, {{and there were}} protests from the health departments of Oregon and Washington. In response to {{an article in the}} Spokane Spokesman Review in September 1985, the Department of Energy announced to declassify environmental records and, in February 1986, released 19,000pages of previously unavailable historical documents about Hanford's operations. The Washington State Department of Health collaborated with the citizen-led Hanford Health Information Network (HHIN) to publicize data about the health effects of Hanford's operations. HHIN reports concluded that residents who lived downwind from Hanford or who used the Columbia River downstream were exposed to elevated doses of radiation that placed them <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> for various cancers and other diseases. A mass tort lawsuit brought by two thousand Hanford downwinders against the federal government has been in the court system for many years. Two of six plaintiffs who went to trial in 2005 were awarded $500,000 in damages.|$|E
5|$|Climate can {{influence}} bat distribution, movements and biogeography, access to food resources, timing of reproduction and emergence {{and rate of}} energy expenditure. In combination with other factors, including ongoing loss and degradation of habitat, global climate change or global warming presents a serious and increasing threat to bats and other fauna. The affinity of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat for riparian zones in arid and semi-arid environments renders it potentially vulnerable {{to the effects of}} water stress and extreme weather events. Ecological factors that qualify the bristle-faced free-tailed bat as being <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> of the potential impacts of global climate change include habitat (species that rely on riparian habitats in water stress prone environments), foraging type (aerial hawking insectivore), roost type (tree hollow specialist), biogeography (species with limited dispersal ability, limited ranging behaviour) and extreme weather (species that occur in regions where there is an increasing risk of extreme temperature events or changes in rainfall patterns).|$|E
5|$|Males {{are also}} {{affected}} by societal expectations, such as notions about masculinity and sexual prowess. Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure {{that emphasizes the}} ability to have erections and sexual intercourse. Men who have strong sexual desire but who {{are not able to}} perform sexually may be <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> for depression, particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core to the male identity. Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with life. Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation. SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection of assumptions about gender norms and sexual function in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those who are able to change the way they think about gender roles may have better life satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation. Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process.|$|E
50|$|The {{main concern}} of the World Health Report 2007 was how the world is <b>at</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>risk</b> of disease outbreaks, epidemics, {{industrial}} accidents, natural disasters and other health emergencies which can rapidly become threats to global public health security.

5|$|The forest cobra {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{frequent}} causes of snake bite among the African cobras, largely due its forest-dwelling habits but a bite by this species should be taken very seriously because it ranks as the 4th most venomous Naja (True Cobra) species. The symptomology is thought to be very {{similar to that of the}} Egyptian cobra (Naja haje). Clinical experience with this species has been very sparse, and few recorded bites have been documented. Deaths from respiratory failure due to severe neurotoxicity have been reported, but most victims will survive if prompt administration of antivenom is undertaken as soon as clinical signs of envenomation have been noted. Rare cases of spontaneous recoveries without the use of specific antivenom have also been seen; however, neglecting the use of antivenom places the patient <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> for major morbidity and mortality. If the snake becomes cornered or is agitated, it can quickly attack the aggressor, and because a large amount of venom is injected, a rapidly fatal outcome is possible. The mortality rate of an untreated bite is not exactly known but it is thought to be quite high. The forest cobra does not spit or spray its venom. This species is considered to be among the most intelligent of the African elapids by herpetologists.|$|E
