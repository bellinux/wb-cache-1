40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{dynamics}} of output, employment <b>and</b> <b>prices</b> in an economy with costs of adjusting labor <b>and</b> <b>prices.</b> In an economy with non convex adjustments costs, firms do not adjust labor <b>and</b> <b>prices</b> continuously to accommodate every shift in demand. Rather, firms adjust employment <b>and</b> <b>prices</b> discontinuously. Employment <b>and</b> <b>prices</b> are adjusted only after demand has shifted beyond a predetermined thresholds. When adjustment is discontinuous, {{the dynamics of}} the aggregate economy {{is very different from the}} behavior of a single firm. The dynamics of the price level, aggregate employment and output depend in a crucial way on the firms' distribution along the inaction intervals. This paper develops a model with infrequent <b>price</b> <b>and</b> labor adjustments. The firms' multivariate distribution of <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> employment deviation from their optimal level is derived and is used to determine {{the dynamics of the}} price level, aggregate employment and aggregate output. It is shown that in such economy money is not neutral. ...|$|R

5|$|Within clade Synapsida, Dimetrodon {{is part of}} the clade Sphenacodontia, {{which was}} first {{proposed}} as an early synapsid group in 1940 by paleontologists Alfred Romer and Llewellyn Ivor Price, along with the groups Ophiacodontia and Edaphosauria. All three groups are known from the Late Carboniferous and Early Permian. Romer <b>and</b> <b>Price</b> distinguished them primarily by postcranial features such as the shapes of limbs and vertebrae. Ophiacodontia was considered the most primitive group because its members appeared the most reptilian, and Sphenacodontia was the most advanced because its members appeared the most like a group called Therapsida, which included the closest relatives to mammals. Romer <b>and</b> <b>Price</b> placed another group of early synapsids called varanopids within Sphenacodontia, considering them to be more primitive than other sphenacodonts like Dimetrodon. They thought varanopids and Dimetrodon-like sphenacodonts were closely related because both groups were carnivorous, although varanopids are much smaller and more lizard-like, lacking sails.|$|E

5|$|Angus Maddison {{estimates}} that the country's gross domestic product was equivalent to $450 per head in 1990 United States dollars—a sum that was above subsistence level, and which did not significantly change {{until the beginning of}} the Song dynasty in the late 10th century. Sinologist Joseph Needham has disputed this and claimed that China's GDP per capita exceeded Europe by substantial margins from the 5th century BCE onwards, holding that Han China was much wealthier than the contemporary Roman Empire. The widespread circulation of coin cash enriched many merchants, who invested their money in land and became wealthy landowners. The government's efforts to circulate cash had empowered the very social class which it actively tried to suppress through heavy taxes, fines, confiscations, <b>and</b> <b>price</b> regulation schemes.|$|E

Nixon's visit to China in 1972 eventually led to diplomatic relations between the two nations, and he initiated détente and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union the same year. His administration generally transferred power from Washington D.C. to the states. He imposed wage <b>and</b> <b>price</b> controls for ninety days, enforced desegregation of Southern schools and established the Environmental Protection Agency. Nixon also presided over the Apollo 11 moon landing, which signaled the end of the moon race.

5|$|On Long Island, {{thousands}} {{were left}} without power {{for over a}} week, until the last outages were restored {{two weeks after the}} storm on October8. The long duration without electricity forced hundreds of schools to close, extended train times by six hours due to lack of powered crossings, <b>and</b> <b>price</b> gouging on food, ice, and generators. The lack of power led to a general disdain for the Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO), which increased further when the company left the $40million (1985USD) repair bill to the ratepayers, citing the company's lack of hurricane insurance. Citizens quickly protested LILCO's decision, and within years the publicly owned Long Island Power Authority was formed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The key {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to explore the impact of different macroeconomic variables on the stock prices in India using annual data from 1990 - 91 to 2010 - 11. A multiple regression model is designed to test the effects of macroeconomic variables on the stock <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> granger causality test is conducted to examine whether there exist any causal linkage between stock <b>prices</b> <b>and</b> macro economic variables. Our estimates of multivariate Granger causality indicate that there is no causal association between stock <b>price</b> <b>and</b> interest rate, stock <b>price</b> <b>and</b> index of industrial production, but unidirectional causality exist between stock <b>price</b> <b>and</b> inflation, stock <b>price</b> <b>and</b> foreign direct investment,stock <b>price</b> <b>and</b> gross domestic product, stock <b>price</b> <b>and</b> exchange rate, stock <b>price</b> <b>and</b> gross fixed capital formation. However, bi- directional causality exist between stock <b>price</b> <b>and</b> foreign exchange reserve, stock <b>price</b> <b>and</b> money supply, stock <b>price</b> <b>and</b> crude oil <b>price</b> <b>and</b> stock <b>price</b> <b>and</b> whole <b>price</b> index. The multiple regression results of the study indicate that oil <b>price</b> <b>and</b> gold <b>price</b> have a significant negative effect on stock price, while balance of trade, interest rate, foreign exchange reserve, gross domestic product, industrial production index and money supply positively influence Indian stock price. On the other hand, inflation rate, foreign direct investment, exchange rate <b>and</b> wholesale <b>price</b> index do not appear to have any significant effect on stock price. The results have implications on domestic as well as foreign investors, stock market regulators, policy makers and stock market analysts...|$|R

5|$|As well, {{ordinary}} {{middle class}} Dutch people began buying art {{for the first}} time, creating a high demand for paintings of all kinds. This demand was met by enormous painter guilds. Master painters set up studios to produce large numbers of paintings quickly. Under the master's direction, studio members would specialise in parts of a painting, such as figures in landscapes, or costumes in portraits and history paintings. Masters would sometimes add a few touches to authenticate a work mostly done by pupils, to maximise both speed <b>and</b> <b>price.</b> Numerous art dealers organised commissions on behalf of patrons, as well as buying uncommissioned stock to sell on. Landscape artists did not depend on commissions in the way most painters had to do, and could therefore paint for stock. In Ruisdael's case, {{it is not known}} whether he kept stock to sell directly to customers, or sold his work through dealers, or both. Art historians only know of one commission, a work for the wealthy Amsterdam burgomaster Cornelis de Graeff, jointly painted with Thomas de Keyser.|$|E
40|$|Based on a duopolistic set-up where firms produce {{software}} {{products with}} respective support packs, we analyze firms' <b>pricing</b> <b>and</b> predetermined monitoring decisions, {{as well as}} the impacts of these factors on welfare. In the presence of end-user piracy, users are classified as support-dependent and support-independent. First, a theoretical model is derived, but, due to its complexity, a numerical example is employed to derive the results. We observe that firms that are in competition face a menu of monitoring <b>and</b> <b>pricing</b> combinations. Our results indicate that (i) firms may use monitoring <b>and</b> <b>pricing</b> as strategic complements, rather than substitutes, (ii) profits are not necessarily an increasing function of both monitoring rates <b>and</b> <b>prices,</b> <b>and</b> welfare improvement from the lowest set of monitoring <b>and</b> <b>pricing</b> levels is possible, (iii) firms may prefer improvement in software rather than support packs, targeting especially the support-independent users.
