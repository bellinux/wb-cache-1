40|$|This Diploma Thesis {{is focused}} on the issues of care for the {{traditional}} folk culture in the Czech Republic. In the theoretical part there is described the development of international and Czech legislative in the field of traditional folk culture, which has an impact on the practical care. The care is practised by the <b>assigned</b> regional <b>centres</b> of care for traditional folk culture in all regions of the Czech Republic. The <b>assigned</b> <b>centres</b> work in accordance with the Strategy of Improved Care for Traditional Folk Culture in the Czech Republic 2011 - 2015. Aim of this thesis is to find out by means of analysis and comparison whether the <b>assigned</b> regional <b>centres</b> fulfil the specific tasks formulated in the Strategy. For this purpose a special questionnaire was created and evaluated. The results of the analysis will be used as a source material by the Ministry of Culture Czech Republic. On the basis of the results {{it will be possible to}} change, reduce of re-formulate the tasks for the regional centres in the new Strategy...|$|R

The crystallization, surface morphology, specific surface area and luminescence properties of the samples have been investigated. Photoluminescence studies of Eu doped LaAlO(3) showed orange-reddish emission due to Eu(3 +) ions. LaAlO(3) :Eu(3 +) exhibits one thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) peak around 400 degrees C. Room temperature electron spin resonance spectrum of irradiated phosphor {{appears to be a}} superposition of two centres. One of them (centre I) with principal g-value 2. 017 is identified as an O(-) centre while centre II with an isotropic g-value 2. 011 is assigned to an F(+) centre (singly ionized oxygen vacancy). An additional defect centre observed during thermal annealing around 300 degrees C grows with the annealing temperature. This <b>centre</b> (<b>assigned</b> to F(+) <b>centre)</b> originates from an F-centre (oxygen vacancy with two electrons) and the F-centre along with the associated F(+) centre appear to correlate with the observed TSL peak in LaAlO(3) :Eu(3 +) phosphor.

40|$|As {{three-dimensional}} {{analysis of}} dendritic microstructures (such as Ni-superalloys) {{has become more}} prevalent {{with the use of}} techniques such as Robomet, synchrotron and computerised tomography, there has been a greater need for accurate and efficient methods to characterise dendrites in three dimensions. One parameter which is needed for a variety of further calculations is the primary dendrite arm spacing. This parameter can be calculated by finding the distances between all of the centres of the dendrites on a single plane. However before this can be computed the locations of all these centres must be obtained. One technique which has often been used in the literature is the centre of geometry method, which simply determines the centre of gravity of each dendrite as seen in a micrograph. However, this method has some major drawbacks. For instance it can <b>assign</b> the <b>centre</b> outside of a dendrite, which often applies to irregular shaped dendrites. As a result another technique shall be presented using skeletonisation. It is shown here that this technique represents good improvement over the centre of geometry method; however it also has drawbacks in certain specific conditions. Combined use of all these methods however shows promise in the search for a reliable method to identify the centres of differently shaped dendrites...|$|R

In the oxidized state a signal with a derivative maximum at g = 2. 02 was assigned to succinate dehydrogenase centre S- 3. Unreduced particles showed additional signals at g = 2. 04 and 1. 98 (at 9. 2 GHz), which {{may be due to}} a spin-spin interaction. In the reduced state a prominent signal at g = 1. 93 and 2. 02 was resolved into at least three components that could be <b>assigned</b> to <b>centres</b> S- 1 and S- 2 of succinate dehydrogenase (midpoint potentials - 7 and - 240 mV respectively at pH 7. 2) and a small amount of centre N- 1 b (e'o= - 240 mV) of NADH-ubiquinone reductase. In addition, changes in line shape around - 10 mV indicated the presence of a fourth component in this signal. The latter was more readily reduced by NADH than by succinate, suggesting that it might be associated with the external NADH dehydrogenase.
