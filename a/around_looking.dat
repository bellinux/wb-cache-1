5|$|Some ticks attach quickly {{while others}} wander <b>around</b> <b>looking</b> for thinner skin such as is {{found on the}} ears of mammals. Depending on the species and the life stage, {{preparing}} to feed can take from ten minutes to two hours. On locating a suitable feeding spot, the tick grasps the host's skin and cuts into the surface. They extract blood by cutting {{a hole in the}} host's epidermis, into which they insert their hypostome, and keep the blood from clotting by excreting an anticoagulant or platelet aggregation inhibitor.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} {{a phone call}} from Knox, Romanelli arrived at the flat. Candace Dempsey writes that in rummaging <b>around,</b> <b>looking</b> for anything that might be missing, Romanelli inadvertently disturbed the crime scene. On discovering that the two phones Kercher typically carried with her had been found in a nearby garden, Romanelli became concerned and requested that the police force open the door to Kercher's bedroom, but the police declined. Instead, Romanelli's male friend forced the door open at around 1:15p.m., and the body of Kercher was found inside, lying on the floor, covered by a duvet.|$|E
25|$|In {{his history}} of the 32nd Armoured Regiment, Maurizio Parri wrote that a company of the II Medium Tank Battalion with its M11/39s had tried to {{counter-attack}} the British Matildas but the crews misunderstood flag signals, which caused delays and the attack failed. In 1944, Moorehead wrote that Maletti was wounded while rallying his men, then retreated to his tent with a machine-gun, where he was killed. Maletti's mortal remains were to be seen {{at the entrance of}} his tent when war correspondents visited the camp. Moorehead wrote that he saw unattended donkeys wandering <b>around</b> <b>looking</b> for water and soldiers looting extravagant Italian army uniforms and lunching on luxury foods, wines and Recoaro mineral water. New equipment, weapons and ammunition strewed the ground, already disappearing under the sand and dozens of dug-outs were found to be full of food, new equipment and ammunition.|$|E

500|$|By 17:00 on August 21, Japanese {{resistance}} had ended. Colonel Ichiki {{was either}} {{killed during the}} final stages of the battle, or performed ritual suicide (seppuku) shortly thereafter, depending on the account. As curious Marines began to walk <b>around</b> <b>looking</b> at the battlefield, some wounded Japanese troops shot at them, killing or wounding several Marines. Thereafter, Marines shot and/or bayonetted any Japanese soldier lying on the ground that moved, although about 15 injured and unconscious Japanese soldiers were taken prisoner. [...] About 30 of the Japanese troops escaped to rejoin their regiment's rear echelon at Taivu Point.|$|E
500|$|Also in the year, she {{starred in}} the horror film The Disappointments Room, {{opposite}} Mel Raido, both playing a couple in a new house that contains a hidden room with a haunted past. The film was heavily panned by critics and flopped at the box office; it only made US$1.4 million in its opening weekend, {{and a total of}} US$2.4 million in North America. Christian Holub of Entertainment Weekly concluded that [...] "ost of the film is just Beckinsale walking <b>around</b> <b>looking</b> worried", while Joe Leydon of Variety found her [...] "credible and compelling [...] except for when sheâ€™s trying way too hard in a rather unfortunate scene that calls for drunken ranting." [...] In late 2016, Beckinsale returned as Selene in the fifth installment of the Underworld franchise, , which grossed US$81.1 million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|The caddisflies, {{or order}} Trichoptera, are {{a group of}} insects with aquatic larvae and {{terrestrial}} adults. There are approximately 14,500 described species, [...] most {{of which can be}} divided into the suborders Integripalpia and Annulipalpia {{on the basis of the}} adult mouthparts. Integripalpian larvae construct a portable casing to protect themselves as they move <b>around</b> <b>looking</b> for food, while Annulipalpian larvae make themselves a fixed retreat in which they remain, waiting for food to come to them. The affinities of the small third suborder Spicipalpia are unclear, and molecular analysis suggests it may not be monophyletic. Also called sedge-flies or rail-flies, the adults are small moth-like insects with two pairs of hairy membranous wings. They are closely related to the Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) which have scales on their wings; the two orders together form the superorder Amphiesmenoptera.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s Kirchherr and her art school friends were {{involved}} in the European existentialist movement whose followers were later nicknamed [...] "Exis" [...] by Lennon. In 1995 she told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "Our philosophy then, because we were only little kids, was wearing black clothes and going <b>around</b> <b>looking</b> moody. Of course, we hadn't a clue who Jean-Paul Sartre was. We got inspired by all the French artists and writers, because that was the closest we could get. England was so far away, and America was out of the question. So France was the nearest. So we got all the information from France, and we tried to dress like the French existentialists... We wanted to be free, we wanted to be different, and tried to be cool, as we call it now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Atypical tarantulas {{have huge}} chelicerae for {{their size and}} {{relatively}} long spinnerets (although {{not as long as}} those found in diplurids).

2500|$|At {{approximately}} 7:09p.m., Zimmerman {{called the}} Sanford police non-emergency number {{to report a}} suspicious person in the Twin Lakes community. Zimmerman said, [...] "We've had some break-ins in my neighborhood, and there's a real suspicious guy." [...] He described an unknown male [...] "just walking <b>around</b> <b>looking</b> about" [...] {{in the rain and}} said, [...] "This guy looks like he is up to no good or he is on drugs or something." [...] Zimmerman reported that the person had his hand in his waistband and was walking <b>around</b> <b>looking</b> at homes. He also mentioned that Martin was wearing a [...] "dark hoodie, like a grey hoodie." [...] On the recording, Zimmerman is heard saying, [...] "these assholes, they always get away." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Johannes {{was still}} an infant his father Johann von Heidenburg died. His stepfather, whom his mother Elisabeth married seven years later, was hostile to {{education}} and thus Johannes could only learn in secret and with many difficulties. He learned Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. When he was 17 years old he escaped from his home and wandered <b>around</b> <b>looking</b> for good teachers, travelling to Trier, Cologne, the Netherlands and Heidelberg. He studied at the University of Heidelberg.|$|E
2500|$|Dewey was {{repeatedly}} urged {{by the right}} wing of his party to engage in red-baiting, but he refused. In a debate before the Oregon primary with Harold Stassen, Dewey argued against outlawing the Communist Party of the United States of America, saying [...] "you can't shoot an idea with a gun." [...] He later told Styles Bridges, the Republican national campaign manager, that he was not [...] "going <b>around</b> <b>looking</b> under beds". Dewey has been the only Republican to be nominated for President twice and lose both times.|$|E
2500|$|In the era before promotional {{videos were}} {{routinely}} produced for every charting single, the BBC would frequently have neither the band themselves nor alternative footage {{available for a}} song selected for the programme. In {{the first few months}} of the show in 1964, the director would just scan across the audience dancing in the absence of any other footage, but by October 1964 a decision was made to at least occasionally bring in a dance troupe with a choreographed routine to some of the tracks as a third option, and also to encourage the audience to dance in the show [...] "otherwise they'd just stand <b>around</b> <b>looking</b> gormless".|$|E

2500|$|Arthur Lowe twice {{appeared}} on the BBC children's programme Blue Peter. The first time was with John Le Mesurier, {{in which the two}} appeared in costume and in character as Captain Mainwaring and Sergeant Wilson when walking <b>around</b> <b>looking</b> at and discussing a mural which schoolchildren had painted featuring the characters from the show at a Christmas party, among whom was Mainwaring's unseen wife Elizabeth â€“ or rather, what the children thought she looked like (Mainwaring remarks [...] "Good grief. What a remarkable likeness!"). Arthur Lowe made a second appearance as Captain Mainwaring on Blue Peter with the Dad's Army van which would appear in the forthcoming London-Brighton run and showed presenter John Noakes the vehicle's hidden anti-Nazi defences.|$|E
2500|$|Wold {{left home}} at 13 [...] to avoid abuse {{at the hands}} of his stepfather, and lived rough and on the road in Tennessee, Mississippi and elsewhere, until 1973. He would travel long {{distances}} by hopping freight trains, looking for work as a farm laborer or in other seasonal jobs, often living as a hobo. At various times, Wold worked at a carnival, as a cowboy and as a migrant worker. Wold described this time of his life by saying [...] "Hobos are people who move <b>around</b> <b>looking</b> for work, tramps are people who move around but don't look for work, and bums are people who don't move and don't work. I've been all three." ...|$|E
2500|$|McGraw's father (whose {{name was}} also John) {{and his older}} brother Michael immigrated from Ireland in 1856. Their last name is spelled [...] "McGrath" [...] but {{pronounced}} McGraw. He and his brother had arrived in time for the Civil War, and were drawn into the conflict as part of the Union army. Shortly after the war, he married; and McGraw's older half-sister was born. John McGraw, Sr.'s first wife died, and he began moving <b>around</b> <b>looking</b> for work â€” a search that ultimately led him to Truxton, New York, in 1871. It was there that the elder John McGraw married young Ellen Comerfort. They had the younger John McGraw on April 7, 1873.|$|E

2500|$|Pearse and {{his brother}} Willie and sisters Margaret and Mary Brigid were born at 27 Great Brunswick Street, Dublin, the street that is named after them today. It was here that their father, James Pearse, {{established}} a stonemasonry business in the 1850s, a business which flourished and provided the Pearses with a comfortable middle-class upbringing. Pearse's father was a mason and monumental sculptor, and originally a Unitarian from Birmingham in England. Pearse's maternal grandfather Patrick was {{a supporter of the}} 1848 Young Ireland movement and was sworn into the IRB. Pearse recalls attending a ballad singer perform republican songs, afterwords he went <b>around</b> <b>looking</b> for armed men ready to fight, he found none and declared sadly to his grandfather that [...] "the fenians are all dead". Pearse's maternal grand uncle, James Savage fought in the American Civil War ...|$|E
2500|$|After the {{shooting}} of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, Today ran a selectively edited version of the 9-1-1 call that George Zimmerman made prior to shooting and killing Martin (which he defended as being committed in self defense while standing trial for {{the shooting}}, {{for which he was}} acquitted on charges of murder in July 2013), which had the effect of making Zimmerman appear racist. In a March 2012 edition of the program, Today played a recording of Zimmerman saying, [...] "This guy looks like he's up to no good. He looks black." [...] However, several seconds of the call were cut from the 911 tape, removing Zimmerman's description of Martin, and a question asked to him about the teenager by the 911 operator. In the original, unedited tape, Zimmerman said, [...] "This guy looks like he's up to no good. Or he's on drugs or something. It's raining and he's just walking <b>around,</b> <b>looking</b> about." [...] The operator then asked, [...] "OK, and this guy â€“ is he black, white or Hispanic?," [...] to which Zimmerman answered, [...] "He looks black." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} season, Kelly began {{to spend more}} time with Harry, much to the chagrin of his wife Debbie. It was implied that both Kelly and Harry had begun to develop {{feelings}} for each other. However, Garth refused to participate in a proposed story line involving an affair. Upon learning that Jackie was dying of cancer, Kelly was initially distant from her mother and protective of Erin (who is commonly called by her surname Silver), eventually causing Silver to move out and live with Jackie. The day after Silver's [...] "half-birthday," [...] Jackie was admitted to the hospital. After talking to Silver, Kelly gained the strength to visit their mother. Eventually, Kelly and Jackie made amends before Jackie's untimely death. Garth departed the series following season 2, later citing problems with the newly appointed show-runner, Rebecca Sinclair, and the direction the show took. Although not written out after her last appearance, she was mentioned several times later in the show, indicating that she was still <b>around</b> <b>looking</b> after her sister, just not on screen.|$|E
