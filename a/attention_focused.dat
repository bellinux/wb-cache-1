40|$|ABSTRACT: An eye {{movement}} recording experiment {{has been carried}} out to pinpoint the control of the primary <b>attention</b> <b>focus.</b> The user's <b>attention</b> <b>focus</b> is strongly influenced by dynamic processes on the screen. E. g., if a pop up menu of an appropriate size automatically appears on the static screen, then the user's <b>attention</b> <b>focus</b> changes to this new element. The results of our investigation indicate that design of a multi media screen layout can be validated and optimised using eye recording data...|$|R
40|$|First, {{a signal}} {{detection}} experiment {{was carried out}} to estimate the maximal distance between the primary <b>attention</b> <b>focus</b> of users and the screen position of visual feedback (e. g. messages). The {{results indicate that the}} maximal distance between the primary <b>attention</b> <b>focus</b> and the position of visual feedback should not exceed 3 ". Second, to pinpoint the location of the primary <b>attention</b> <b>focus</b> we carried out an eye movement recording experiment. The results indicate that if the task solving process requires mouse operations and the visual feedback of the results of these mouse operations appears close to the mouse cursor, then the visual focus and the mouse cursor position on the screen are highly correlated: between 76 % and 95 % correspondence.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} a two-mechanism memory {{model of the}} online auditory comprehension of object relative (OR) sentences in 7 – 11 -year-old typically developing children. Mechanisms of interest included working memory storage (WMS) and <b>attention</b> <b>focus</b> switching. We predicted that both mechanisms would be important for comprehension. Forty-four children completed a listening span task indexing WMS, an auditory <b>attention</b> <b>focus</b> switching task, and an agent selection task indexing spoken sentence comprehension. Regression analyses indicated that WMS and <b>attention</b> <b>focus</b> switching accuracy each accounted for significant and unique variance in the children’s OR comprehension after accounting for age. Results were interpreted to suggest that WMS is important for OR comprehension by supporting children’s ability to retain both noun phrase 1 and noun phrase 2 prior to their reactivating noun phrase 1 from memory in order to integrate it into a developing structure. <b>Attention</b> <b>focus</b> switching was interpreted to be critical in supporting children’s noun phrase 1 reactivation, as they needed to switch their <b>focus</b> of <b>attention</b> momentarily away from ongoing language processing to memory retrieval...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} <b>attention</b> <b>focus</b> {{and balance}} control in eighteen healthy young adults and eighteen healthy older adults. All participants performed sixteen consecutive trials of a balance task which involved standing for 30 -s on an unstable platform that could rotate {{only in the}} roll direction. There were no <b>attention</b> <b>focus</b> instructions provided {{on any of the}} sixteen trials. Following the completion of the initial and final attempt in the series, participants reported "where" their <b>attention</b> had been <b>focused</b> when performing the task. The results showed differences in balance between young and older adults and improvements in balance with practice in both young and older adults. However, there were no differences in <b>attention</b> <b>focus</b> strategies between young and older adults. Both age groups directed attention to multiple sources during the balance task. An equal focus on internal (i. e., feet, trunk, and other body parts) and external (i. e., the platform) sources with little focus on events not related to the task dominated on the first attempt of the balance task. Focus on internal sources was maintained and focus on events not related to the task increased at the expense of focus on external sources on the final attempt of the balance task. Following the series of sixteen trials to establish "natural" <b>attention</b> <b>focus,</b> participants performed three randomly presented trials, each with specific <b>attention</b> <b>focus</b> instructions (i. e., think about minimizing movements of the feet, the trunk, or the platform). The results showed that, in contrast to the literature, instructions to focus on an internal source, the trunk, actually augmented control of the task as reflected in reduced trunk sway whereas instructions to focus on an internal source, the feet, or an external source, the platform, did not benefit performance on the task. Thus, the distance fi-om the interaction point of the body with the external source is critical and may not depend on whether the source is internal or external. Thus, a global <b>attention</b> <b>focus</b> instruction may not be beneficial {{and the nature of the}} task should be considered when adopting <b>attention</b> <b>focus</b> instructions for young and older adults...|$|R

5|$|In {{the month}} {{prior to the}} Sugar Bowl, media <b>attention</b> <b>focused</b> on Virginia Tech's sudden rise to {{national}} prominence and Florida State's perennial appearance in the national championship game. The Seminoles had the most top-5 finishes and the most national championship game appearances of any team in the 1990s, including a national championship victory in 1993. Many media stories focused on the apparent David and Goliath showdown between the two teams, with the Seminoles {{in the role of}} the overdog and the Hokies {{in the role of the}} underdog. Because of this fact, spread bettors favored Florida State to win the game by 5.5points.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} before the Gator Bowl, media and fan <b>attention</b> <b>focused</b> on Virginia Tech's {{possible}} disappointment at not being selected for a BCS game, the coaching situations at the two schools, {{and the issue of}} whether or not Tech quarterback Michael Vick would return for another year of collegiate football. After the Virginia Tech-Clemson matchup was announced for the Gator Bowl, spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win by 6.5 points. The betting line remained there throughout the month of December and until the game began. There were almost no off-field incidents involving players from either team: The only notable event involved two backup players from Clemson who were indicted for money counterfeiting and were suspended for the Gator Bowl. In exchange for appearing in the game, the teams were guaranteed to split a payout of $3,313,610.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Eye {{movement}} recording is a helpful, but costly {{method to}} measure the primary <b>attention</b> <b>focus</b> of a user [Rauterberg, 1993]. If {{there is a possibility}} to estimate the <b>attention</b> <b>focus</b> with a cheap method, then we can use this 'discount' method during the design process without loosing time and money. We try to prove the hypothesis that eye movements correlate with users' choices in mock-ups. 2 Two Empirical Investigations: 'Mock-up' and 'Eye Movement Recording' We carried out two different empirical investigations with exactly the same multimedia screens: (1.) an experiment with measurements of eye movements (8 men, 263 years), and (2.) a mock-up study (17 women, 346 years). From both investigations we got two different kinds of data: (a) the unconscious eye movements as a parameter of the users' <b>attention</b> <b>focus</b> during an interactive task solving process with a multimedia information system [Rauterberg, 1995]; (b...|$|R
40|$|Localized {{muscular fatigue}} has been {{identified}} to have detrimental effects on balance control, an important skill for everyday life. Manipulation of <b>attention</b> <b>focus</b> instructions {{has been shown to}} benefit performance of various motor skills including balance and has been found to facilitate endurance during fatiguing tasks. The purpose of this thesis was to determine if the use of <b>attention</b> <b>focus</b> instructions could attenuate the effects of muscular fatigue on balance control. Twenty-four participants performed a balance task (two-legged stance on an unstable platform) before and after a fatigue protocol. Trunk sway, platform excursions, and lower limb muscle activity was measured. Results suggest that use of either internal or external <b>attention</b> <b>focus</b> instructions can reduce the immediate effects of muscular fatigue of the lower limb on balance control as shown through reduced trunk sway and platform excursions. These results have relevance for individuals performing balance tasks in a fatigued state...|$|R

5|$|In January 1898, Spain promised some {{concessions}} to the rebels, but when American consul Fitzhugh Lee reported riots in Havana, McKinley agreed to send the battleship USS Maine there to protect American lives and property. On February 15, the Maine exploded and sank with 266 men killed. Public <b>attention</b> <b>focused</b> on the crisis and the consensus was that regardless of who set the bomb, Spain had lost control over Cuba. McKinley insisted that a court of inquiry first determine whether the explosion was accidental. Negotiations with Spain continued as the court considered the evidence, but on March 20, {{the court ruled that}} the Maine was blown up by an underwater mine. As pressure for war mounted in Congress, McKinley continued to negotiate for Cuban independence. Spain refused McKinley's proposals, and on April 11, McKinley turned the matter over to Congress. He did not ask for war, but Congress declared war anyway on April 20, with the addition of the Teller Amendment, which disavowed any intention of annexing Cuba.|$|E

40|$|Whereas {{considerable}} developmental memory {{research has}} examined the contributions of short-term memory, processing efficiency, retention duration, and scope of attention to complex memory span, {{little is known about}} the influence of controlled attention. The present study investigated the relative influence of three understudied attention mechanisms on the verbal working memory span of school-age children: memory updating; <b>attention</b> <b>focus</b> switching; and sustained attention. Results of general linear modeling revealed that, after controlling for age, only updating accuracy emerged as a significant predictor of verbal working memory span. Memory updating speed (that subsumed <b>attention</b> <b>focus</b> switching speed) also contributed but was mediated by age. The results extend the developmental memory literature by implicating the mechanism of memory updating and developmental improvement in speed of <b>attention</b> <b>focus</b> switching and updating as critical contributors to children’s verbal working memory. Theoretically, the results provide substantively new information about the role of domain-general executive attention in children’s verbal working memory...|$|R

5|$|The CIA {{began to}} {{investigate}} the disappearances of its agents, initially suspecting that bad tradecraft, a Soviet breach of Moscow Station or the CIA's communications, or a mole {{was responsible for the}} disaster. Suspicions fell on spy dust (METKA), a KGB compromise of CIA cables, or new Soviet surveillance tactics, but these probes proved unsuccessful. Ames' conspicuous spending drew the attention of the molehunters in late 1989, but he passed a polygraph test. However, the molehunt regained momentum in 1991 as it received more officers to work on the case. <b>Attention</b> <b>focused</b> on Ames and other suspects, and his finances were investigated once more in 1992; in August, the investigators linked Ames' bank deposits with his meetings with the Soviets. In March 1993, the molehunter unit concluded that there was a KGB mole within the CIA who had followed Howard, and the FBI began close surveillance of Ames, monitoring his office and home, and tracking his car. A June 25 search of his office found about 144 classified documents unrelated to his work; an analysis of his finances found an unexplained $1,326,310; and subsequent searches of Ames' trash and residence found further documents on CIA operations and agents, as well as Ames' own espionage for the KGB. On February 21, 1994, Ames and his wife, Rosario, were arrested by FBI agents: The duo pled guilty to espionage, and the Senate Intelligence Committee requested that the CIA's Inspector General review the case.|$|E
