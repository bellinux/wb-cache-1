5|$|The {{southern}} terminus of I-35E is at exit 88A in Burnsville, where I-35 splits into I-35E and I-35W. While I-35W heads {{north into}} Minneapolis, I-35E takes a northeasterly path into Saint Paul. There is no access between I-35E and I-35W here, but Dakota County Road 42 (exit 88B), {{immediately to the}} north, connects the two Interstates in Burnsville. Major interchanges south of Saint Paul include State Highway 77 (MN77, signed as Cedar Avenue—exit92) at Apple Valley– Eagan and Interstate 494 (exit99) in Mendota Heights. Between exits94 and 97, the highway deviates from its relatively straight path to avoid Blackhawk Lake. As it crosses I-494, I-35E turns more to the north, crossing MN110 (exit101) and MN13 (exit102) in Mendota Heights before crossing the Mississippi River on the Lexington Bridge into the city of Saint Paul. This portion of I-35E is four lanes wide (two in each direction), except between MN77 and MN110, where it carries six lanes. The Lexington Bridge carries six lanes—four through lanes and the exit and entrance lanes for MN13—as well as a bicycle and pedestrian path. The bridge has an innovative automatic <b>anti-icing</b> <b>system</b> that sprays potassium acetate onto the bridge surface to prevent frost and ice formation in inclement weather.|$|E
25|$|The EC155 B {{features}} a completely redesigned cabin providing 30% more passenger space than previous Dauphin helicopter models, plus a 130% increase in baggage hold volume. Other major improvements include a five-blade Spheriflex composite main rotor {{combined with the}} familiar shrouded Fenestron tail rotor to reduce vibration levels significantly. The EC155 B is powered by two 635kW (851 shp) Turbomeca Arriel 2C1 turboshaft engines mounted over the luggage hold, which feature a dual-channel Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system. The EC155 B1 features uprated 697kW (935 shp) Arriel 2C2s. The helicopter can be fitted with an <b>anti-icing</b> <b>system</b> to enable the aircraft to operate in very cold climates. The all-glass cockpit is equipped with an 'Avionique Nouvelle' integrated digital flight control system featuring Eurocopter's Vehicle and Engine Management Display (VEMD), which utilizes active matrix liquid crystal displays. The EC155 is also equipped with a four-axis digital autopilot, coupled to the engine FADECs for full-envelope protection, and is offered with a Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS).|$|E
25|$|The EC225 {{is based}} on the Eurocopter AS332L2 Super Puma, {{improving}} upon the design with a five-blade main rotor incorporating a new airfoil shape to reduce vibration and noise levels. The blades of the rotors feature a composite spar and parabolic blade tips; they can also be equipped with an <b>anti-icing</b> <b>system</b> to enable the aircraft to operate within very cold climates. The helicopter is powered by two Turbomeca Makila 2A1 turboshaft engines mounted over the cabin; these engines are capable of providing 14 per cent more engine power and feature a redundant dual-channel full authority digital engine control (FADEC) system for high reliability, a further backup system is present in the event of both FADEC systems failing. The FADEC system ensures that engine power is always kept within the limits of the gearbox. Many of the mechanical components, particularly of the engines, were designed to be modular to ease maintenance, and composite materials were used where possible to reduce the aircraft's weight.|$|E

40|$|During severe winter {{conditions}} bridges freeze {{before the}} surrounding roadways, often catching unsuspecting drivers off guard. Depending on weather and pavement conditions, automatic bridge deck <b>anti-icing</b> <b>systems</b> spray chemicals that prevent or minimize ice bonding to the pavement. The Nebraska Department of Roads (NDOR) {{is interested in}} installing such systems on various bridges statewide. However, the presence of 2, 193 bridges in Nebraska and availability of limited funding required candidate bridge prioritization for installation of automatic <b>anti-icing</b> <b>systems</b> based on relevant criteria. This research was undertaken {{with the objective of}} developing a decision-aid tool that could aid NDOR with the prioritization of bridges for installation of automatic <b>anti-icing</b> <b>systems.</b> The authors reviewed literature on automatic bridge <b>anti-icing</b> <b>systems</b> and the experiences of various transportation agencies. Factors considered important in the installation of automatic <b>anti-icing</b> <b>systems</b> included: accident history, bridge alignment, weather, traffic, and bridge distance from maintenance yard, among others.

500|$|Many {{of these}} changes were made to {{aircraft}} before Pe-3bis production resumed in April 1942 and combat-use revealed several additional problems {{that had to be}} addressed in a second Pe-3bis prototype, which began its State acceptance tests in May 1942. Reloading the nose guns proved to be time-consuming, taking up to 45minutes, and the night-firing of the port-side UBK continued to blind the pilot. These problems prompted the transfer of both UBK guns to the wing center section where they were installed in a compartment that was hinged at the front to drop down and allow easier access to the guns and their ammunition. The starboard gun was given 230rounds and the port gun had 265rounds. This change reduced the capacity of the Nr. 7fuel tank by , but an asbestos bulkhead was added to protect the tank from heat generated by the guns. The changes meant that the cartridge cases from the ShVAK cannon could not be collected, making the skin and lower fuselage vulnerable. These were reinforced with steel sheets to minimize the damage inflicted by the large-caliber cases. The original mounting for the dorsal UBT machine gun provided an excellent field of fire, but lack of aerodynamic balance prevented the gunner/navigator to use its full range. Pressure exerted by the airstream prevented the gunner from traversing more than about 40–50° from the centerline. A twin-petal compensator proved mostly ineffective. The crash pylon was removed to give the gunner more working space. The ammunition box of the UBT was too small, only 30rounds, and took about a minute to reload. The boxes were deleted and the UBT was given a 200-round belt with an electric drive to help to prevent feed problems. An <b>anti-icing</b> <b>system</b> was added for the propellers and the pilot's windscreen. The nose glazing was replaced entirely and the crew's armor was increased to a total weight of [...] These changes moved the aircraft's center of gravity forward and the landing gear struts were lengthened, moving the wheels [...] forward, which helped to reduce the chance of the aircraft tipping over.|$|E
2500|$|In {{late 1990s}} the Hellenic Air Force (HAF) issued {{a request for}} {{acquiring}} more modern and capable SAR helicopters [...] in order to replace its ageing fleet of Agusta Bell AB-205 SAR helicopters, which were in use since 1975. The need for an all-weather, day and night, long range SAR helicopter for operations throughout the Athens FIR came up after the Imia/Kardak incident of 1996 and the growing tension between Greece and Turkey over territorial water disputes on the Aegean Sea. The Greek government, signed a deal with Eurocopter in 1998 [...] for purchasing initially 4 AS-332 C1 Super Pumas. H.A.F. acquired 2 more Super Pumas for air support operations of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games and 6 more helicopters followed up in the period 2007–2011 for the new CSAR role of the 384 SAR/CSAR Sq. All HAF helicopters are of the C1 version, including a 4-axis auto pilot, a NADIR type1000 navigation and mission management computer, FLIR turrets, an RBR1500B search radar, an engine <b>anti-icing</b> <b>system,</b> a hydraulic and an electrical hoist, a SPECTROLAB SX-16 searchlight, engine exhaust gas deflectors, a Bertin loudspeaker and 6 stretcher interior configuration for MEDEVAC missions.|$|E

5000|$|... 13 {{minutes after}} take off, while {{climbing}} through FL215, AH5017 slightly deviated {{to the left}} to avoid a storm in the area. They reported this to Ouagadougou ACC. However, even though they knew that a storm had occurred in the area, the flight crews did not activate the engine <b>anti-icing</b> <b>system.</b> At the time, {{the temperature in the}} area was at big risk of icing. According to the procedures, the engine anti-ice system should be activated. Even though ice crystals were likely formed due to the temperature and weather in the area, however the airframe seemed to be not affected by icing. This was also what happened to the windshield. The probable absence of icing on the airframe, in particular on the windshield wipers, the possible lack of clear signs of ice crystal, which may be difficult to visually detect, especially at night, and which are usually not detectable on the weather radar, and the absence of significant turbulence, probably did not encourage the crew to activate the engine <b>anti-icing</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mechanics report ice {{present on}} the inlet guide vanes, engine {{cowlings}} and engine bullet noses, but no ice {{was found on the}} aircraft surfaces. A mechanic recommended that the engine <b>anti-icing</b> <b>system</b> be used, but no maintenance was performed on the aircraft in Anchorage. Investigators suspected that ice on the airfoil or transducer may have caused the stall warning to fail.

50|$|The Tu-204 {{is part of}} a new {{generation}} of Russian aircraft, including other recent developments such as the Ilyushin Il-96. The Tu-204 features many technological innovations such as fly-by-wire control systems, a glass cockpit, supercritical wings with winglets, and is available with Russian or foreign avionics. The wings and tails are relatively resistant to ice build-up, and as such anti-icing systems are not equipped. Among today's airliners the Tu-204 is the only one which does not require wing anti-icing systems. During the test flight safety has been confirmed without the <b>anti-icing</b> <b>system</b> on the bearing surfaces and the aircraft obtained Russian and European certificates.|$|E
50|$|On January 13, 1982, Air Florida Flight 90 {{crashed into}} Washington, DC's 14th Street Bridge {{and fell into}} the Potomac River shortly after taking off. A total of 70 passengers, 4 crew and 4 motorists on the bridge were killed. The crash of the Boeing 737-200 was due to an <b>anti-icing</b> <b>system</b> being left off, which caused an inaccurately high engine {{pressure}} ratio (EPR) indication at an extremely low power setting and the crew's failure to either abort the takeoff or apply maximum engine power. The crash prompted modifications to Air Florida's pilot training regarding anti-ice systems. The FAA also required revised aircraft de-icing procedures at airports.|$|E
50|$|Following {{an inquiry}} by the Air Accident Investigation Branch and the RAF, it was {{determined}} that the DC loom on the aircraft's Number 4 engine had somehow sustained damage prior to the flight. An arc occurred when the <b>anti-icing</b> <b>system</b> was turned on, which led to the engine air start sequence initiating. The engine was running idle as part of the testing regime during the flight, so when the starter turbine ran up to high speed, it caused a structural failure that led to the turbine disc puncturing one of the fuel tanks. The fuel leak was subsequently ignited, either by the high engine temperature, or the arc from the faulty loom.|$|E
40|$|A hybrid ice {{protection}} system has been developed to provide an economical alternative to conventional <b>anti-icing</b> <b>systems</b> on roughness sensitive airfoils where high power is either impractical or unavailable. It consists of a thermal subsystem operating in a running-wet mode that partially or fully covers the impingement zone at the leading edge, and a low power de-icing subsystem just downstream. The thermal system maintains a clean leading edge in the roughness sensitive zone by preventing the impinging supercooled water droplets from freezing. This requires minimal power because the surface temperature is held just above freezing. The heated water then runs back and freezes downstream where the low power de-icing system removes the ice contamination periodically. The total power consumption of the hybrid system is {{a fraction of that}} required to achieve total evaporation. Tests conducted in the NASA Lewis Icing Research Tunnel on a truncated horizontal stabilizer section of a light business jet proved the hybrid system to be a viable alternative to conventional <b>anti-icing</b> <b>systems</b> that require substantial power.

5000|$|The {{aircraft}} {{had been}} cruising {{for a long}} period with the number two and number three engines at a low power setting. This meant that the <b>anti-icing</b> <b>systems</b> run from the engines were not at a temperature sufficient for them to operate correctly. As a result, ice built up on the tailplane, which disrupted the airflow, causing the loss of pitch control when the flaps were being fully extended on final approach.|$|R
50|$|Many modern civil {{fixed-wing}} {{transport aircraft}} use <b>anti-ice</b> <b>systems</b> {{on the leading}} edge of wings, engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. The warm air heats the surface up to a few degrees above 0 °C (32 °F), preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions.|$|R
