5|$|Amulets and idols {{fashioned}} from assorted natural materials have occupied an important place among many ethnic groups of Madagascar for centuries. Ody, personal amulets believed to protect or allocate powers to the wearer, were commonplace objects possessed by anyone from slave children to kings. The name sampy {{was given to}} those amulets that, while physically indistinguishable from ody, were distinct in that their powers extended over an entire community. The sampy were often personifiedcomplete with a distinct personalityand offered their own house with guardians dedicated to their service. Ralambo amassed twelve of the most reputed and powerful sampy from neighboring communities. He furthermore transformed {{the nature of the}} relationship between sampy and ruler: whereas previously the sampy had been seen as tools at the disposal of community leaders, under Ralambo they became divine protectors of the leader's sovereignty <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>of</b> the state which would be preserved through their power on the condition that the line of sovereigns ensured the sampy were shown the respect due to them. By collecting the twelve greatest sampytwelve being a sacred number in Merina cosmologyand transforming their nature, Ralambo strengthened the supernatural power and legitimacy of the royal line of Imerina.|$|E
5|$|Pardelup Prison Farm {{opened in}} 1927, near Mount Barker, while Barton's Mill, though {{planned to be}} a {{temporary}} measure, remained open as a prison after World War II. Pardelup operated as a working farm, with a large-scale dairy, cattle and pig raising, and crops, and Barton' Mill prisoners cut timber to supply hospitals, houses, and the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme's pumping station at Mundaring. In both cases, the only aspects resembling a prison were the presence of guards, and the compulsion to remain there – enforced by the remoteness of the facilities <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>of</b> prisoners chosen to be transferred there. Escapees were generally punished with extended sentences at the harsher Fremantle Prison, which had little change over the four decades from 1920 to 1960.|$|E

25|$|The Whitley {{holds the}} {{distinction}} of having been the first aircraft to serve with the RAF to utilise a semi-monocoque fuselage, which was built using a slab-sided structure to ease production. This replaced the traditional tubular construction method previously employed by Armstrong Whitworth, instead constructing the airframe from light-alloy rolled sections, pressings, and corrugated sheets. According to aviation author Philip Moyes, the decision to adopt the semi-monocoque fuselage design was a significant step forwards, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>of</b> which was well-proven during subsequent RAF service, having survived multiple instances of severe damage being sustained.|$|E

25|$|Throughout Bảo Đại's life in both Vietnam and in France, he {{remained}} unpopular among the Vietnamese populace {{as he was}} considered a political puppet for the French colonialist regime, for lacking any form of political power, and for his cooperation with the French and for his pro-French ideals. The former emperor clarified, however, that his reign was always a constant battle and a balance between preserving the monarchy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>of</b> the nation versus fealty to the French authorities. Ultimately, power devolved away from his person and into ideological camps and {{in the face of}} Diem's underestimated influences on factions within the empire.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the Polish nobility opposed the Warsaw Confederation and considered Leszczyński's election illegal. The predominant pro-Augustus party convened the Sandomierz Confederation in May 1704 under Stanisław Denhoff as marshal, declaring their intent to defend the King <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>of</b> the state and seeking the Tsardom's protection. Accordingly, the Treaty of Narva was concluded on August 30, 1704 in the recently won by the Russians Narva, {{with the purpose of}} facilitating a common front against Sweden, giving Russia the right to fight Swedish armies on the Commonwealth's territory. The Commonwealth was promised a (never realized) recovery of Livonia and the Tsardom obliged itself to help in suppressing the Cossack uprising of Semen Paliy in the right-bank Ukraine, but the treaty opened opportunities for Russia's future involvement in the affairs of the Commonwealth.|$|E

25|$|On 16 October 2013, {{the provincial}} {{government}} of Bohol asked to the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) for the postponement of the barangay elections after the province was heavily devastated by the quake. The following day, Bohol governor Edgar Chatto announced during the Presidential visit that the provincial board will submit a resolution to the COMELEC postponing the 28 October elections. The same day COMELEC visited the province and evaluated the safety conditions of polling centers. On 22 October COMELEC officially announced the postponement of elections in Bohol citing safety issues <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>of</b> the buildings being used as polling centers. The elections in the province was rescheduled on 25 November and synchronized with the affected barangays of Zamboanga City, which was affected by the armed conflict against the Moro National Liberation Front on 9 to 28 September 2013.|$|E
25|$|Another {{contributory}} {{factor was}} the lack of attention paid to Adolf Galland's basic rules of combat. In the tactical battle, he argued that the fighter must fight on the offensive, even when on defensive missions. There was no place for a defensive posture. An example of this dictum being ignored was the instance of having Bf 109 groups escort vulnerable and heavily armed Focke-Wulf Fw 190s which had replaced the vulnerable Zerstörer twin-engined fighters, which reduced the power of interception formations. Combat cohesiveness was frequently disregarded, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>of</b> the formations became compromised and ignored (owing to a lack of experienced leaders). Fixed tactical scheme contributed to failures as well. Rigid tactics were allowed to take root, and technique suffered. Using surprise, cunning and manoeuvrability had to be combined with aggressiveness and improvisation depending on the situation. This sort of tactical advantage was lost over time.|$|E
25|$|People born in Kosovo or {{otherwise}} legally settled in Kosovo are by law considered Serbian nationals {{and as such}} {{they are entitled to}} a Serbian passport. However, these passports are not issued by the Serbian Ministry of the Interior. Instead they are issued by the Serbian Coordination Directorate. These particular passports do not allow the holder to enter the Schengen Area without a visa for a stay of less than three months within half a year, while Serbian citizens with passports issued by the Serbian Ministry of the Interior enjoy such a privilege. Bearers of passports issued by the Serbian Coordination Directorate require Schengen visa for travel to Schengen area since they are not covered by the Annex II list of countries allowed visa free entry to the Schengen Area. The European Union considered it impossible for Serbia to evaluate the issuing of breeder documents needed to apply for a passport <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>of</b> the procedures applied by Serbia to check the authenticity of documents provided by applicants for that purpose.|$|E

25|$|Robert J. Maynard, Jr., {{a co-founder}} of the company, {{resigned}} in June 2007 amid questions about his past <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>of</b> his story regarding his founding of LifeLock. Maynard spent several days in a Maricopa County Jail in 2003 because of an alleged unpaid $16,000 casino marker from The Mirage. Under Nevada law, casino markers are considered the same as checks. Maynard reportedly {{came up with the}} plan for LifeLock while sitting in his jail cell. An investigation by the Phoenix New Times revealed that the $16,000 casino marker actually was his. The Mirage had gotten a copy of his Arizona driver's license when it made him the loan, and charges were dropped after Maynard repaid the marker. The New Times found that Maynard had been banned for life from the credit-repair industry after an agency he owned was shut down for numerous deceptive practices. It found evidence he ordered an American Express card in his father's name and ran up $150,000 in fraudulent charges. Maynard no longer has any affiliation with LifeLock.|$|E
500|$|Both {{major parties}} lavished Diệm with praise.

500|$|Ljotić {{believed}} that divine providence had [...] "destined the Serbian {{people for a}} certain grand role". This concept became a recurring theme in his writings.

He was an ardent monarchist and believed in authoritarianism, the corporative organization of the state, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>of</b> Yugoslavia. He considered himself a Christian politician, and his devotion to the Christian faith earned him the nickname Mita Bogomoljac (Devotionalist Mita).

Many did, but at least two {{are known to have}} been murdered by Ljotić's forces during the war.|$|E
