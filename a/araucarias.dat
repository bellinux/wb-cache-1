They include a myliobatiform ray referred to the genus Baibisha; an indeterminate member of the Neopterygii; a semionotid referred to the genus Lepidotes; a gar related to Atractosteus; a pycnodontid referred to the genus Stephanodus; and an indeterminate bowfin. Indeterminate caudatans (salamanders) and mammals are also present. As for plants, pollen samples indicate a tiered forest surrounding the lakes of the Mussentuchit, containing a canopy of tree ferns, <b>araucarias,</b> and conifers, accompanying an undergrowth of ferns, small gymnosperms, and flowering plants. Algae would also have been present in the waters of the lakes. These plants would have provided an abundant source of food for Eolambia.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Araucaria</b> angustifolia is an {{environmentally}} threatened {{tree and the}} whole biota of the <b>Araucaria</b> Forest should be investigated {{with the aim of}} its preservation. Diazotrophic bacteria are extremely important for the maintenance of ecosystems, but they have never been studied in <b>Araucaria</b> Forests. In this study, diazotrophic bacteria were isolated from <b>Araucaria</b> roots and soil, when grown in semi-specific, semi-solid media. The diazotrophic character of some recovered isolates could be confirmed using the acetylene reduction assay. According to their 16 S rRNA sequences, most of these isolates belong to the genus Burkholderia...|$|R

50|$|First {{identified}} by Europeans in Chile in the 1780s, {{it was named}} Pinus araucana by Molina in 1782. In 1789, de Jussieu had erected a new genus called <b>Araucaria</b> based on the species, and in 1797, Pavón published a new description of the species which he called <b>Araucaria</b> imbricata (an invalid name, as it did not use Molina's older species epithet). Finally, in 1873, after several further redescriptions, Koch published the combination <b>Araucaria</b> araucana, validating Molina's name in the genus. The name araucana {{is derived from the}} native Araucanians who used the nuts (seeds) of the tree in Chile. A group of Araucanians living in the Andes, the Pehuenches, owe their name to their diet based on harvesting of the A. <b>araucaria</b> seeds. Pehuen means <b>Araucaria</b> and che means people in Mapudungun.|$|R

40|$|<b>Araucaria</b> angustifolia, {{also known}} as the Paraná Pine is an {{endangered}} tree species in Brazil and little is known of the diversity of soil invertebrates inhabiting these forests. Therefore, the present study was set up to evaluate the biomass and diversity of earthworms in natural and reforested <b>Araucaria</b> plots, impacted or not by fire, and to identify the most efficient earthworm collection method. Four study areas included: native forest with <b>Araucaria</b> (NF); <b>Araucaria</b> reforestation (R); <b>Araucaria</b> reforestation submitted to an accidental fire (RF); and native grass pasture with native <b>Araucaria</b> and submitted to an intense accidental fire (NPF). Five soil samples containing the earthworm community were taken in a 0. 3 ha area in each of the forest sites, close to five <b>Araucaria</b> trees selected at random. Three collection methods were tested: application of dilute Formol (0. 5 %) to the soil surface, handsorting of small (25 ´ 25 cm) or large (40 ´ 40 cm) monoliths. Five earthworm species were found: the native Glossoscolex sp. 1, Glossoscolex sp. 2, Glossoscolex bondari and Urobenus brasiliensis (Glossoscolecidae), and the exotic Amynthas corticis (Megascolecidae). Formol was more efficient for collecting A. corticis, found in much higher abundance and biomass in NF than in the other areas. Larger handsorted samples were more efficient for capturing Glossoscolex species, mainly present in RF and NPF. For adequate characterization of earthworm abundance and biomass in these <b>Araucaria</b> forests, both the Formol and the larger monolith methods are recommended...|$|R
