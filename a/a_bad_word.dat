[...] He {{found it difficult to}} discover anyone who had <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>word</b> to say about him, either during his life or since.

He would at times undertake contracts of little benefit to himself to provide work for his navvies. The only faults which his eldest son could identify were a tendency to praise traits and actions of other people he would condemn in his own family, and an inability to refuse a request. No criticism of him could be found from the engineers with whom he worked, his business associates, his agents or his navvies. [...] He paid his men fairly and generously.|$|E
