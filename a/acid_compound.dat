50|$|The {{synthesis}} of gambierol {{consists of two}} tetracyclic precursor molecules, one alcohol and one acetic acid, that fuse together. The whole {{synthesis of}} gambierol is depicted in the figure below. After obtaining the octacyclic backbone, the tail is added via Stille coupling. The acetic <b>acid</b> (<b>compound</b> 1) and alcohol (compound 2) are converted to compound 3. The reaction of compound 3 with the titanium alkylidene from dibromide 1,1-dibromoethane, provides cyclic enol ether (compound 4). Oxidation of the alcohols gives majorly compound 5, but also compound 6. This are both ketones, but they have other stereochemistry. Compound 6 can be converted back in compound 5 with reactant c, thereby moving the equilibrium towards compound 5. This ketone can be converted further to produce reactive gambierol. By reductive cyclization of the D ring, the octacyclic core structure (compound 7) was made. Oxidation of compound 7 to the aldehyde was followed by formation of the diiodolefin. Stereoselective reduction, global deprotection and Stille coupling of compound 8 with dienyl stannane (compound 9) provide gambierol.|$|E

The five acetylenic acids were evaluated for their in vitro antifungal activities against Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida krusei, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Trichophyton rubrum by comparison with the positive control drugs amphotericin B, fluconazole, ketoconazole, caspofungin, terbinafine, and undecylenic acid. The compounds showed various degrees of antifungal activity against the 21 tested strains. Compound 4 was the most active, in particular against the dermatophytes T. mentagrophytes and T. rubrum and the opportunistic pathogens C. albicans and A. fumigatus, with MICs comparable to several control drugs. Inclusion of two commercially available acetylenic acids, 9 -octadecynoic <b>acid</b> (<b>compound</b> 6) and 5, 8, 11, 14 -eicosatetraynoic <b>acid</b> (<b>compound</b> 7), in the in vitro antifungal testing further demonstrated that the antifungal activities of the acetylenic acids were associated with their chain lengths and positional triple bonds.

Furthermore, compounds 3 and 4 did not produce obvious toxic effects in mice at a dose of 34 μmol/kg of body weight when administered intraperitoneally.
