5|$|David's {{activities}} and whereabouts after 1114 are not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> to trace. He {{spent much of}} his time outside his principality, in England and in Normandy. Despite the death of his sister on 1 May 1118, David still possessed the favour of King Henry when his brother Alexander died in 1124, leaving Scotland without a king.|$|E
5|$|It is not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> {{to predict}} a grown Appaloosa's color at birth. Foals of any breed {{tend to be}} born with coats that darken when they shed their baby hair. In addition, Appaloosa foals do not always show classic leopard complex characteristics. Patterns {{sometimes}} change {{over the course of}} the horse's life although some, such as the blanket and leopard patterns, tend to be stable. Horses with the varnish roan and snowflake patterns are especially prone to show very little color pattern at birth, developing more visible spotting as they get older.|$|E
5|$|L.lubrica fruit {{bodies are}} similar to those of Cudonia confusa, {{commonly}} known as the cinnamon jellybaby. The species can be differentiated by the fact that L.lubrica fruit bodies are more sturdy, and those of C.confusa are much paler in colour. Another Cudonia species, C. circinans (which is highly similar to C. lutea), is similar to L. lubrica, though it can be differentiated by its colour (which is more brown), spores (which are smaller and thinner) and texture (which is less slimy and gelatinous than L. lubrica). L. lubrica fruit bodies can also be mistaken for those of the much rarer L.atrovirens, which can be differentiated by its darker colouration. L.viscosa can again be differentiated by colouration; the species has a green head. However, as L. lubrica fruit bodies can sometimes have a greenish hue, differentiation between the two species is not <b>always</b> <b>easy.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "As you please," [...] said Rosey, with {{a slight}} pout; [...] "but you will find {{it much easier to}} {{discover}} him than his treasure. It's <b>always</b> <b>easier</b> to find the thing you're not looking for." ...|$|R
50|$|It's a small {{library with}} lots of functionality, {{accurately}} documented and thoroughly tested. Good library naming conventions are not rigorously observed {{on the principle that}} common operations should <b>always</b> be <b>easy</b> to write and code should <b>always</b> be <b>easy</b> to read.|$|R
25|$|Classification of Athens printings is not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> {{and there}} are {{substantial}} differences between the various catalogues and specialized publications. Generally the following scheme is accepted, while most experts expand it further with more categories, especially for the period 1861–1862. The Scott catalogue numbers are given for each issue.|$|E
25|$|Since ravines {{were often}} {{formed by the}} union of several thalwegs upstream, the choice of which {{tributary}} to keep as the boundary marker between plots of land up high was not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> and often led to disputes. This problem was aggravated {{by the fact that}} some of the ravines in question had several names, which made for a possible source of confusion.|$|E
25|$|The {{symbolism}} used {{in ancient}} churches is not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> for modern people to read. Virtues and vices may {{be represented by}} small figures with particular attributes, or by animals that were thought to embody a particular quality. A common example is the pelican which was thought to peck its breast to feed its young on the blood, thus representing the love of Christ for the Church.|$|E
50|$|Hysteresis can {{be defined}} roughly as ‘the lagging of an effect behind its cause’.When {{measuring}} hearing thresholds it is <b>always</b> <b>easier</b> for the subject to follow a tone that is audible and decreasing in amplitude than to detect a tone that was previously inaudible.|$|R
5000|$|Gröbner basis {{theory was}} {{initially}} introduced for the lexicographical ordering. It was soon realised that the Gröbner basis for degrevlex is almost <b>always</b> much <b>easier</b> to compute, {{and that it}} is almost <b>always</b> <b>easier</b> to compute a lex Gröbner basis by first computing the degrevlex basis and then using a [...] "change of ordering algorithm". When elimination is needed, degrevlex is not convenient; both lex and lexdeg may be used but, again, many computations are relatively easy with lexdeg and almost impossible with lex.|$|R

It seems that the perpetrators are found. But to punish is <b>always</b> <b>easier</b> than to help correct the mistakes.|$|R
25|$|This technique, {{known as}} radio {{direction}} finding (RDF), is useful but only moderately accurate. Measurements better than a few degrees are difficult with a small antenna, {{and because of the}} electrical characteristics, it is not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> to make a larger version that might provide more accuracy. Moreover, the addition of a loop antenna may be difficult on smaller vehicles, or difficult to operate for those without a dedicated navigator.|$|E
25|$|Identification of Japanese {{knotweed}} is not <b>always</b> <b>easy.</b> Many {{other plants}} {{are suspected of}} being knotweed, due often to the similar appearance of leaves and stems. Dogwood, lilac, Houttuynia (Houttuynia cordata), ornamental Bistorts such as Red Bistort (Persicaria amplexicaulis), lesser knotweed (Persicaria campanulata), Himalayan Balsam (Impatiens glandulifera), Broadleaved Dock (Rumex obtusifolius), Bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis), bamboo, Himalayan Honeysuckle (Leycesteria formosa), and Russian Vine (Fallopia baldschuanica) have been suspected of being Fallopia japonica.|$|E
25|$|Milton embraced many heterodox Christian {{theological}} views. He {{rejected the}} Trinity, {{in the belief}} that the Son was subordinate to the Father, a position known as Arianism; and his sympathy or curiosity was probably engaged by Socinianism: in August 1650 he licensed for publication by William Dugard the Racovian Catechism, based on a non-trinitarian creed. A source has interpreted him as broadly Protestant, if not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> to locate in a more precise religious category.|$|E
60|$|This suited me. It is <b>always</b> <b>easier</b> to talk intimately in the dark, and I did {{not wish}} to be {{interrupted}} by the sudden entrance of the Hired Man or Mrs. Beale, of which there was always a danger indoors. We walked down to the paddock. Ukridge lit a cigar.|$|R
5000|$|A philosopher {{spends his}} summer with his children, his ex-wife and his ex-gardener (his ex-wife's new husband) {{to write his}} autobiography. His notes are {{interspersed}} with his wife's side of the story, and though philosophy was <b>always</b> <b>easier</b> for Oliver than real life, real life is about to come crashing down around him.|$|R
60|$|Father labored with her, {{and cooked}} beans for her. She made him agree {{to get as}} far from New York as their nine dollars would take them before they should begin to be vagrants. It's <b>always</b> <b>easier</b> to be a bold adventurer in some town {{other than the one}} in which you are.|$|R
25|$|During {{the seventeenth}} and eighteenth centuries, or the Age of Enlightenment, neo-classical culture was pervasive. English {{literature}} {{in the middle of that}} period has been dubbed Augustan. It is not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> to distinguish Horace's influence during those centuries (the mixing of influences is shown for example in one poet's pseudonym, Horace Juvenal). However a measure of his influence can be found in the diversity of the people interested in his works, both among readers and authors.|$|E
25|$|It is not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> to {{determine}} whether B12 deficiency is present, especially within older adults. Patients may present with violent behaviour or more subtle personality changes. They may also present with vague complaints, such as fatigue or memory loss, that {{may be attributed to}} normative aging processes. Cognitive symptoms may mimic behaviour in Alzheimer's and other dementias as well. Tests must be run on individuals presenting with such signs to confirm or negate cobalamin deficiency within the blood.|$|E
25|$|The {{t-distribution}} {{is often}} used {{as an alternative to}} the normal distribution as a model for data, which often has heavier tails than the normal distribution allows for; see e.g. Lange et al. The classical approach was to identify outliers and exclude or downweight them in some way. However, it is not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> to identify outliers (especially in high dimensions), and the t-distribution is a natural choice of model for such data and provides a parametric approach to robust statistics.|$|E
40|$|Oscillator lattices with random {{frequency}} distribution are numerically studied. We measured the local synchronization rate R in various oscillator lattices {{and found that}} on the lattices with more connections the oscillators are not <b>always</b> <b>easier</b> to synchronize. We also found strange behavior in which R is decreased as the coupling strength K is increased...|$|R
50|$|One-time pads solve few current {{practical}} problems in cryptography. High quality ciphers {{are widely available}} and their security is not considered a major worry at present. Such ciphers are almost <b>always</b> <b>easier</b> to employ than one-time pads; the amount of key material which must be properly generated and securely distributed is far smaller, and public key cryptography overcomes this problem.|$|R
60|$|It is <b>always</b> <b>easier</b> to work {{upon the}} {{sensitiveness}} of a spirited and generous-minded man, than to influence him by force or apprehensions. Roswell had never {{liked the idea}} of leaving Daggett behind him, at that season, and in that latitude; and he relished it still less, now that he saw a false reason might be attributed to his conduct.|$|R
25|$|Behavioral and {{ecological}} separation of tinamou species is evident where their ranges overlap through {{the utilization of}} different food sources and occupation of limited micro-habitats. These micro-habitats are not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> to identify, and are highly vulnerable to environmental changes. Some species, such as the red-winged tinamou, utilize multiple habitats such as the open savannas of Amazonia and the dry valleys of the Andes. Similarly, brown tinamous occur in both the Amazon basin and the humid montane forests on the Andean slope.|$|E
25|$|In Paris Huygens had an {{important}} patron and correspondent in Jean-Baptiste Colbert. However, {{his relationship with the}} Academy was not <b>always</b> <b>easy,</b> and in 1670 Huygens, seriously ill, chose Francis Vernon to carry out a donation of his papers to the Royal Society in London, should he die. Then the Franco-Dutch War took place (1672–8). England's part in it (1672–4) is thought to have damaged his relationship with the Royal Society. Robert Hooke for the Royal Society lacked the urbanity to handle the situation, in 1673.|$|E
25|$|In his {{commemorative}} speech, Alfred Brauer (PhD candidate Schur) {{spoke about}} Issai Schur as follows: As a teacher, Schur was excellent. His lectures were very clear, but not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> and required cooperation - During the winter semester of 1930, {{the number of}} students who wanted to attend Schur's theory of numbers lecture, was such that the second largest university lecture hall with about 500 seats was too small. His most human characteristics were probably his great modesty, his helpfulness and his human interest in his students.|$|E
50|$|Historically, it’s not <b>always</b> been <b>easy</b> {{to achieve}} {{arrangements}} {{that work for}} both supplier and buyer and because of practical problems, it hasn’t <b>always</b> been <b>easy</b> for buyers to actually pay early. But with {{the increased use of}} Purchase to Pay (P2P) technologies and methods there is now no reason why a buyer cannot pay promptly depending on how the collaborative arrangements with the supplier have been agreed.|$|R

25|$|In {{an effort}} to end the shame and secrecy of infertility, Redbook in October 2011 {{launched}} a video campaign, The Truth About Trying, to start an open conversation about infertility, which strikes one in eight women in the United States. In a survey of couples having difficulty conceiving, conducted by the pharmaceutical company Merck, 61 percent of respondents hid their infertility from family and friends. Nearly half didn't even tell their mothers. The message of those speaking out: It's not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> to get pregnant, and there's no shame in that.|$|E
25|$|During the 17th and 18th centuries, {{literary}} theorists in Europe {{distinguished between}} {{two types of}} lyric poetry, loosely associated with Horace and Pindar. Regular verses in four line stanzas were associated with Horace's Odes, which did in fact inspire and influence poets of the period. Irregular verses in longer stanzas were termed Pindarics though the association with Pindar was largely fanciful. Abraham Cowley was considered the main exponent of English Pindarics. In fact, the two styles were not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> to distinguish and many 'Pindaric' odes were quite Horatian in content, as in some poems by Thomas Gray.|$|E
25|$|The {{similarities}} between China today and New York 150 years ago shouldn't {{come as a}} great surprise. Adulteration on such a scandalous scale occurs in societies with a toxic combination of characteristics: a fast-growing capitalist economy coupled with a government {{unable or unwilling to}} regulate the food supply. In such get-rich-quick societies, there is a huge temptation to tamper with food, particularly when margins are low. The rewards are instant, and it's not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> for consumers to detect the difference between the pure and the doctored—particularly with a substance like milk, which we have been taught to trust implicitly.|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of collusion in infinitely repeated duopoly games has generally assumed that marginal cost is constant, but this note uses quadratic costs (linear marginal costs) {{to compare the}} sustainability of collusion under Bertrand and Cournot duopoly with differentiated products. It is shown that when marginal costs are sufficiently increasing in output, then it is <b>always</b> <b>easier</b> to sustain collusion under Cournot duopoly than under Bertrand duopoly for any degree of product substitutability...|$|R
40|$|The {{important}} facts {{relevant to}} {{the historical development of}} a scientific discovery are <b>always</b> <b>easier</b> to discern when it is possible to examine them {{in the light of the}} knowledge to which time and the work of many investigators have contributed.

60|$|Then he {{struggled}} hard {{for an hour}} to keep his mind fixed {{on the subject of}} his great work. He had found an unknown memoir respecting Bacon, written by a German pen in the Latin language, published at Leipzig shortly after the date of Bacon's fall. He could translate that. It is <b>always</b> <b>easiest</b> for the mind to work in such emergencies, on some matter as to which no creative struggles are demanded from it.|$|R
