500|$|Beyond {{strictly}} {{legal and}} political concerns, Sawyer was also interested in the plight of black Americans, and {{became involved in the}} Civil Rights movement. According to his friend and fellow lawyer, Arlin M. Adams, Sawyer [...] "was troubled by the treatment of blacks in the South." [...] In 1965, he traveled to Selma, Alabama, to help register black voters there and in Mississippi, and gave legal representation to activists who were charged with breaking local ordinances. Closer to home, he also sued the Philadelphia Police Department and its commissioner, Frank Rizzo, over allegations that black applicants to the police academy were being unfairly rejected. Sawyer represented nine black applicants in a series of cases that spanned nearly a decade, culminating in court-ordered measures to ensure greater racial diversity on the force. In 1972, he again sued Rizzo (who was by then Mayor of Philadelphia) over improper funding of the city workers' pension fund. As Sawyer's son Jonathan recalled in 1999, [...] "a magazine printed Rizzo's top-10 enemies, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> on the list. He was very proud that he made it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ruskin's {{political}} ideas, and Unto This Last in particular, later proved highly influential, praised and paraphrased in Gujarati by Mohandas Gandhi, a {{wide range}} of autodidacts, the economist John A. Hobson and many {{of the founders of the}} British Labour party. [...] Ruskin believed in a hierarchical social structure. He wrote [...] "I was, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> before me, a violent Tory of the old school." [...] He believed in duties and responsibilities to, and under, God, and whilst he sought to improve the conditions of the poor, he opposed attempts to level social differences and sought to resolve social inequalities by abandoning capitalism in favour of a co-operative structure of society based on obedience and benevolent philanthropy, rooted in the agricultural economy.|$|E

2500|$|On one {{particular}} day of water-fowling near Pune in 1885, Aqa Ali Shah contracted pneumonia. Describing the incident, his son Sultan Muhammad Shah later wrote, [...] "There were several hours' heavy rain, the going underfoot was heavy and wet, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> soaked to the skin. He caught a severe chill which turned swiftly and fatally to pneumonia." [...] He died eight days later, after an imamate of four years, and {{was buried in}} the family mausoleum in Najaf on {{the west bank of the}} Euphrates, near Kufa and the tomb of Imam Ali, one of the holiest places in the world for Shia Muslims. The mausoleum is also the resting place of Aqa Ali Shah's grandfather, Shah Khalil Allah, who was the forty-fifth Imam of the Nizari Ismailis, and for whom the mausoleum was first constructed.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a speech}} at the 1999 Berlin Film Festival, Zimmer stated that he is Jewish, and talked about his mother {{surviving}} the war thanks to her escape from Germany to England in 1939. In an interview with Mashable in February 2013, he said of his parents [...] "My mother was very musical, basically a musician <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> an engineer and an inventor. So, I grew up modifying the piano, shall we say, which made my mother gasp in horror, and my father would think it was fantastic when I would attach chainsaws and stuff like that to the piano because he thought it was an evolution in technology." [...] In an interview with the German television station ZDF in 2006, he commented: [...] "My father died when I was just a child, and I escaped somehow into the music and music has been my best friend." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Kaminsky, much of Huston's vision {{probably}} {{came from}} his early experience as a painter {{on the streets of}} Paris. While there, he studied art and worked at it {{for a year and a}} half. Huston continued painting as a hobby for most of his life. Kaminsky also notes that most of Huston's films [...] "reflected this prime interest in the image, the moving portrait and the use of color." [...] Huston explored the use of [...] "stylistic framing", especially well-planned close-ups, in much of his directing. In his first film, The Maltese Falcon, for instance, Huston sketched out all of his scenes beforehand, [...] "like canvases of paintings". His daughter, Anjelica Huston adds that even for his subsequent films, he sketched storyboards [...] "constantly". She agrees that for her father, [...] "it was a form of study, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> a painter, a very good one." [...] She also notes that [...] "there was an extremely developed sensory quality about my father, he didn't miss a trick." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then I {{will go to}} Somers, and {{he shall}} tell me. <b>My</b> <b>father's</b> {{interest}} in this property cannot have been involved without his knowledge; and circumstanced as we <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>are,</b> he is bound to tell me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I understand," [...] said Ida. [...] "You {{mean that}} <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{should try to}} win over Mr. Edward Cossey. Unfortunately, to be frank, he dislikes him, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> not a man to keep his dislikes to himself." ...|$|R
2500|$|Zhirinovsky has {{expressed}} {{admiration for the}} 1996 United States presidential election contender Pat Buchanan, referring positively to a comment in which Buchanan labeled the United States Congress [...] "Israeli-occupied territory." [...] Zhirinovsky said that both countries were [...] "under occupation." [...] and that [...] "to survive, we could set aside places on U.S. and Russian territories to deport this small but troublesome tribe." [...] Buchanan strongly rejected this endorsement, saying he would provide safe haven to persecuted minorities if Zhirinovsky were ever elected Russia's president, eliciting a harsh response by Zhirinovsky: [...] "You soiled your pants {{as soon as you}} got my congratulations. Who are you afraid of: Zionists?" [...] Zhirinovsky repeatedly denied his father's Jewishness until he published Ivan Close Your Soul in July 2001, describing how his father, Volf Isaakovich Eidelshtein, changed his surname from Eidelshtein to Zhirinovsky. He rhetorically asked, [...] "Why should I reject Russian blood, Russian culture, Russian land, and {{fall in love with the}} Jewish people only because of that single drop of blood that my father left in my mother's body?" [...] Another frequently cited quote from Zhirinovsky is [...] "My mother was Russian <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> a lawyer". Zhirinovsky later disowned the statement, after researching his father's life in Israel (where, after leaving Zhrinovsky's mother, he had immigrated in 1949 with a new wife, and worked as an agronomist in Tel Aviv). Discussing the statement, Zhirinovsky says: [...] "Journalists mocked me: for saying I was the son of a lawyer. And I am really the son of an agronomist." [...] Discussing his father, Zhirinovsky says with tears in his eyes: [...] "All my life I was looking for him. I believed that he was alive. I believed that someday he would find me... But there is a silver lining. I tried to imitate him... And I was able to achieve a certain position in life, even without the support of my father." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mrs Null, [...] "not since I was {{a little}} girl. I suppose you have heard, sir, that Aunt Keswick <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>were</b> on very bad terms, {{and would not have}} {{anything}} to do with each other?" ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{when she}} saw that she could in no way escape from him, she began to weep, and said, 'I pray thee let me go, for I am the only {{daughter}} of a King, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> aged <b>and</b> alone.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have heard}} of these things,' replied Scherirah, with a {{thoughtful}} air. 'My mother was a Jewess, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> a Kourd. Whichever be right, I hope to be saved.' ...|$|E
6000|$|There was a tremour in Mrs. Fraser's {{voice and}} an {{answering}} one in Elliott's as he replied: [...] "Mary Helen Rodney was my dear mother's name, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> John Hanselpakker." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He likes going his own way," [...] Jean said shortly. [...] "As far as {{business}} matters go, he <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>are</b> as one; {{but in other}} matters they differ widely.

40|$|I {{first became}} {{interested}} in socialism and the Communist Party {{in the town of}} Lithgow.

There <b>were</b> six children <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>’s</b> wages were insufficient for our family needs, so we always lived very close to poverty.

6000|$|... "My {{father was}} hanged two years ago," [...] replied Jan simply, [...] "because he spoke disparaging {{words of the}} Stadtholder. Those words were called treason, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> {{condemned}} to the gallows merely for speaking them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I rather think not. She and Beulah were in {{the nursery}} with little Evert, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> in the fields. I came out without {{speaking}} to any person, nor did I meet any before entering the forest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my friend," [...] quoth Beresteyn {{with slow}} emphasis, [...] "that vervloekte scoundrel {{was making a}} promise to my father to bring Gilda safely back to Haarlem, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> {{promising}} him a fortune as his reward." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, Phil, I don't," [...] {{replied the}} other in a {{slightly}} petulant tone; [...] "I don't feel quite sure of the spirit in which he referred to my dear father.

6000|$|... "If {{half of what}} he {{has written}} is true," [...] said Florence, [...] "your uncle's youth must have been {{perfectly}} appalling.
