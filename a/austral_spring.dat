40|$|Four {{research}} {{surveys of}} Falkland Island waters {{were carried out}} to determine the distribution and abundance of the early life-history stages of Loligo gahi (d'Orbigny, 1835) in the austral winter of 1988 and the <b>austral</b> <b>springs</b> of 1990, 1991 and 1992. Juveniles were caught during {{three of the four}} surveys in both Bongo nets and an RMT 8 net.

The use of an opening/closing net in 1992 showed that most L. gahi juveniles aggregate close to the sea floor and are more available to the sampling gear by night than by day. Limited temperature data for the 1991 and 1992 surveys suggest that distribution on the coastal shelf may be associated with water-column structure. In 1992 when temperature data implied a mixed water column, juveniles were caught in deeper water than in 1991 when the water column was stratified. The results suggest that the spawning grounds of L. gahi are probably situated to the south and east of the Falkland Islands, at least for squid hatched in the austral winter/spring...|$|R

A nursery ground for eggs of this species was first identified in 2002 in Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea), where eggs were found trapped in ice platelets under the sea-ice during the spring. As part of a monitoring program aimed atunderstanding the geographic and temporal characteristics of this nursery ground, the present study reports on surveys carried out in the <b>austral</b> <b>springs</b> of 2005 and 2006 using a simple and effective method for sampling from the sea-ice.

40|$|International audienceThe Concordiasi {{project is}} making {{innovative}} {{observations of the}} atmosphere above Antarctica. The most important goals of the Concordiasi are as follows: 1. To enhance the accuracy of weather prediction and climate records in Antarctica through the assimilation of in situ and satellite data, {{with an emphasis on}} data provided by hyperspectral infrared sounders. The focus is on clouds, precipitation, and the mass budget of the ice sheets. The improvements in dynamical model analyses and forecasts will be used in chemical-transport models that describe the links between the polar vortex dynamics and ozone depletion, and to advance the understanding of the Earth system by examining the interactions between Antarctica and lower latitudes. 2. To improve our understanding of microphysical and dynamical processes controlling the polar ozone, by providing the first quasi-Lagrangian observations of stratospheric ozone and particles, in addition to an improved characterization of the 3 D polar vortex dynamics. Techniques for assimilating these Lagrangian observations are being developed. A major Concordiasi component is a field experiment during the <b>austral</b> <b>springs</b> of 2008 - 10. The field activities in 2010 are based on a constellation of up to 18 long-duration stratospheric super-pressure balloons (SPBs) deployed from the McMurdo station.

When breeding the birds have long feathers (nuptial plumes) on the neck, head and back. A typical clutch has three to five pale blue eggs. with an average size of 48.5×35 mm. Normally only one brood is raised per year. Incubation lasts approximately 25 days. The parents guard the chicks for 3-4 weeks and fledging takes place 40 days after hatching. Typical nestling predators include kookaburras, Australian magpies, harriers and owls.|$|E

The adults were observed to prey mainly on caterpillars and moths and this was confirmed by observations at the nest as the young were fed predominantly with moths and caterpillars. The study also found that the rate at which nestlings were fed was dependent on their age, the older chicks receiving food more often than younger ones. In contrast to nestlings, younger fledglings were fed at a higher rate than older ones.|$|E

50|$|Over Australia {{the drying}} {{influence}} of the event was initially counteracted by warm temperatures in the Indian Ocean, which lead to above average rainfall falling over parts of Western Australia, New South Wales and eastern Victoria. However, {{by the start of}} <b>austral</b> <b>Spring</b> 2015, the Indian Ocean had started to help the El Nino, which resulted in Australia's third-driest spring on record and limited growth at the end of cropping season. The lack of heavy rains in the north and west meant reduced downtime for mining, while fewer clouds and less tropical rain, contributed to the most severe coral bleaching event on record for the Great Barrier Reef. The combination of heat and low rainfall brought a very early start to the 2015-16 Australian bushfire season, with over 125 fires burning in Victoria and Tasmania during October. Dry conditions in Tasmania also resulted in hundreds of fires being started by dry lightning during January 2016, which damaged large areas of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, including parts which may not have seen fire for centuries.|$|E
