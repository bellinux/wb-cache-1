The SOAP data are compared to previous gas transfer parameterisations using u 10 N computed from the EC friction velocity with the drag coefficient from the COARE model. The SOAP results are consistent with previous gas transfer studies, but at high wind speeds they do not support the sharp increase in gas transfer associated with bubble-mediated transfer predicted by physically based models...|$|R

The flow field {{of a system of}} four jets arranged circumferentially and issuing into a confined counterflow was studied experimentally and numerically. The total pressure distortion parameters were evaluated at the Aerodynamic Interface Plane (AIP) for several values of mass flow ratios. Since the total pressure loss distribution at the AIP is characteristically "V" shaped, the number of jets was increased to obtain total pressure distributions as required for gas turbine engine testing. With this understanding, a methodology has been developed to generate a target total pressure distortion pattern at the AIP. Turbulent flow computations are used to iteratively progress towards the target distribution. This methodology was demonstrated for a distortion flow pattern typical of use in gas turbine engine testing using twenty jets, which is a smaller number than reported in the literature.

Due to technical reasons, some of these applications require packaging of the micromirror’s optical module in ambient air. Furthermore, micromirrors for picoprojectors application are required to function at high frequencies in order to achieve high resolution images. Accordingly, a study of the energy dissipated due to the interaction between the moving parts of the micromirror and the surrounding air, leading to fluid damping, is an important issue. Even if air damping has been thoroughly studied, an extension to large <b>air</b> domain <b>distortion</b> linked to large tilting angles of torsional micromirrors is still partially missing. In such situations, the flow formation turns out to be far more complex than that assumed in analytical models.

The Surface Ocean Aerosol Production (SOAP) voyage in February–March 2012 examined the distribution and flux of dimethylsulfide (DMS) in a biologically-active frontal system in the southwest Pacific Ocean. Three distinct phytoplankton blooms were studied with oceanic DMS concentrations as high as 25  nmol L − 1. Measurements of DMS fluxes were made using two independent methods: the eddy covariance (EC) technique using API-CIMS chemical ionization mass spectrometry, and the gradient flux technique (GF) from an autonomous catamaran platform. Catamaran flux measurements are relatively unaffected by <b>air</b> flow <b>distortion</b> and are made close to the water surface where gas gradients are largest. Flux measurements were complemented by near-surface hydrographic measurements to elucidate physical factors influencing DMS emission. Individual DMS fluxes derived by EC showed significant scatter and, at times, consistent departures from the COARE gas exchange parameterization. A direct comparison between the two flux methods was carried out to separate instrumental effects from environmental effects, and showed good agreement with a regression slope of 0. 96 (r 2  =  0. 89). A period of abnormal downward atmospheric heat flux enhanced near-surface ocean stratification and reduced turbulent exchange, during which GF and EC transfer velocities showed good agreement but modelled COAREG values were significantly higher. The transfer velocity derived from near surface ocean turbulence measurements on a spar buoy compared well with the COAREG model in general, but showed less variation. This first direct comparison between EC and GF fluxes of DMS provides confidence in compilation of flux estimates from both techniques, {{and also in the}} stable periods when the observations are not well-predicted by the COAREG model...|$|R
40|$|In {{the design}} of a modern natural draught wet-cooling tower, {{structural}} and performance characteristics must be considered. <b>Air</b> flow <b>distortions</b> and resistances must be minimised to achieve optimal cooling which requires that the cooling towers must be modelled two-dimensionally and ultimately three-dimensionally to be optimized. It is found that CFD models in literature are limited to counterflow cooling towers packed with film fills which are porous in one direction only and generally have a high pressure drop, as well as purely crossflow cooling towers packed with splash fill, which simplifies the analysis considerably. Many counterflow cooling towers are however packed with trickle and splash fills which have anisotropic flow resistances, which means the fills are porous in all flow directions and thus air flow can be oblique through the fill, particularly near the cooling tower air inlet. This provides a challenge since available fill test facilities and subsequently fill performance characteristics are limited to purely counter- and crossflow configuration. This paper presents a CFD model to predict the performance of natural draught wet-cooling tower with any type of fill configuration, which can be used to investigate the effects of different atmospheric temperature distributions, air inlet and outlet geometries, air inlet heights, variations in radial water loading and fill depth, fill configurations, rain zone drop size distributions, and spray zone performance characteristics on cooling tower performance for optimization purposes. Furthermore the effects of damage or removal of fill in annular sections and boiler flue gas discharge in the centre of the tower can be investigated. The fill performance characteristics for oblique air flow are determined by linear interpolation between counter- and crossflow fill characteristics in terms of the air flow angle. The CFD results are validated by means of corresponding one-dimensional computational model data. © 2010 by ASME...|$|R

40|$|Anemometers on Voluntary Observing Ships (VOS) {{are usually}} located above the bridge {{in a region}} where the effects of <b>air</b> flow <b>distortion,</b> created by the {{presence}} of the ship, may be large. Until now it was not known whether measurements from such anemometers would be biased high or low, and the possible magnitude of any such bias was not known. Investigations into the airflow above merchant ships have been carried out experimentally using a low-speed wind tunnel and numerically using a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code VECTIS. The investigations examined the airflow over simple block models of VOS shapes. The results of the investigations were compared to wind speed measurements made from the RRS Charles Darwin. Experimental and CFD techniques have been used to devise scaling rules that predict the effects of the flow distortion. Both techniques have shown that the pattern of the flow distortion above the bridge scales with the ‘step height’, H, of the model. In the case of a tanker, H is the ‘bridge to deck’ height, i. e. the height of the accommodation block above the deck, for bow-on flows. Close {{to the top of the}} bridge the flow is severely decelerated and may even reverse in direction. Using the upwind edge of the bridge as the origin of the scaled co-ordinate system, there is a definite line above the decelerated region along which the speed of the flow is equal to the undistorted wind speed. Above this ‘line of equality’ the wind speed increases to a maximum and then decreases with increased height to a free stream wind speed. Simple equations have been devised to predict the positions of the ‘line of equality’, the maximum wind speed and the minimum wind speed within the decelerated region. Comparisons of the results with wind speed data obtained from field measurements made using a number of anemometers located on the RRS Charles Darwin agreed well and have predicted a maximum wind speed increase of approximately 15 ± 5 %. Comparisons with the field data have confirmed that CFD models can be used to predict the effects of airflow distortion above merchant ships. The investigation has demonstrated the ability of the wind tunnel and CFD approaches employed to provide a better understanding of the airflow over merchant ships. Both methods have contributed to improve the understanding of how the wind speed at anemometer sites on merchant ships is affected by the ships hull and superstructure. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of an aircraft {{gas turbine engine}} is adversely affected by the non-uniform or distorted flow in the inlet duct. Inlet flow distortion lowers the surge margin of the engine‟s compression system with surge occurring at much lower pressure ratios at all engine speeds. The compressor and/or engine are subjected to ground tests {{in the presence of}} inlet distortion to evaluate its performance. The simplest method of simulating inlet distortion during these tests is by installing a distortion screen ahead of the engine on the test bed. The uniform inlet flow to the compressor becomes nonuniform with total pressure loss after passing through the distortion screen. Though the distortion screens offer a number of significant advantages, they have some disadvantages. The <b>air</b> jet <b>distortion</b> system can alleviate many of the operational disadvantages encountered with the conventional distortion screens. The system consists of a number of air jets arranged in a circumferential array in a plane and issuing opposite to the primary air flow entering the engine. The jets interact with the primary stream and cause a local total pressure loss due to momentum exchange. The individual mass flow rates from the jets can be varied to obtain a required total pressure pattern ahead of the compressor at the Aerodynamic Interface Plane (AIP). A systematic study of the flow field of confined, turbulent, incompressible, axisymmetric jet issuing into counterflow is covered in this research programme. The jet penetration length and the jet width are reduced compared to unconfined counterflow and a linear relationship between the velocity ratio and the jet length ceases to be valid. The flow field of a circular compressible turbulent jet and then a system of four jets arranged circumferentially and issuing into a confined counterflow was studied experimentally and numerically. For the four jet system the mass flow rates in the four jets were equal {{in the first part of}} the study and in the second part they were unequal. The loss in total pressure due to the jet(s) interacting with the counterflow was quantified by a total pressure loss parameter λp 0. The total pressure loss increased with increasing mass flow ratio. The total pressure loss distribution was evaluated at several locations behind the jet injector(s). The total pressure non-uniformity quantified by Distortion Index (DI) was found to be highest at a location just downstream of the jet injector and at far downstream locations low values of DI were observed. From the understanding gained with a single jet and four jets in counterflow a methodology was developed to generate a given total pressure distortion pattern at the AIP. The methodology employs computations to obtain the total pressure distortion at the AIP with quasi-one-dimensional inviscid analysis used as a starting point to estimate the mass flow rate in the jets. The inviscid analysis also provides a direction to the iterative procedure to vary the mass flow rate in the jets at the end of each computational step. The methodology is demonstrated to generate a given total pressure distortion pattern using four jets and is further extended to a larger number of jets, twelve and later twenty jets. The total pressure distortion patterns typical of use in aircraft gas turbine engine testing are generated accurately with a smaller number of jets than reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Nonrigid {{deformation}} {{modeling and}} estimation from images is a technically challenging task {{due to its}} nonlinear, nonconvex and high-dimensional nature. Traditional optimization procedures often rely on good initializations and give locally optimal solutions. On the other hand, learning-based methods that directly model the relationship between deformed images and their parameters either cannot handle complicated forms of mapping, or suffer from the Nyquist Limit and the curse of dimensionality due to high degrees of freedom in the deformation space. In particular, to achieve a worst-case guarantee of ∈ error for a deformation with d degrees of freedom, the sample complexity required is O(1 /∈d). In this thesis, a generative model for deformation is established and analyzed using a unified theoretical framework. Based on the framework, three algorithms, Data-Driven Descent, Top-down and Bottom-up Hierarchical Models, are designed and constructed to solve the generative model. Under Lipschitz conditions that rule out unsolvable cases (e. g., deformation of a blank image), all algorithms achieve globally optimal solutions to the specific generative model. The sample complexity of these methods is substantially {{lower than that of}} learning-based approaches, which are agnostic to deformation modeling. To achieve global optimality guarantees with lower sample complexity, the structureembedded in the deformation model is exploited. In particular, Data-driven Descentrelates two deformed images that are far away in the parameter space by compositionalstructures of deformation and reduce the sample complexity to O(Cd log 1 /∈). Top-down Hierarchical Model factorizes the local deformation into patches once theglobal deformation has been estimated approximately and further reduce the samplecomplexity to O(Cd/ 1 +C 2 log 1 /∈). Finally, the Bottom-up Hierarchical Model buildsrepresentations that are invariant to local deformation. With the representations, theglobal deformation can be estimated independently of local deformation, reducingthe sample complexity to O((C/∈) d 0) (d 0 ≪ d). From the analysis, this thesis showsthe connections between approaches that are traditionally considered to be of verydifferent nature. New theoretical conjectures on approaches like Deep Learning, arealso provided. practice, broad applications of the proposed approaches have also been demonstrated to estimate water <b>distortion,</b> <b>air</b> turbulence, cloth deformation and human pose with state-of-the-art results. Some approaches even achieve near real-time performance. Finally, application-dependent physics-based models are built with good performance in document rectification and scene depth recovery in turbulent media...|$|R
