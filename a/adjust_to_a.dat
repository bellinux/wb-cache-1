From the beginning of the post-war period, Western Europe and Japan rapidly recovered from the destruction of World War II and sustained strong economic growth through the 1950s and 1960s, with per capita GDPs approaching those of the United States, while Eastern Bloc economies stagnated.|$|E
5|$|Speaking {{about her}} role in voicing Saya, Mizuki said that she {{initially}} thought she would need to reimagine the entire character for her performance as Saya in the movie. It was later decided that the core character had changed little despite {{the events of the}} series finale, so Mizuki did not have to adjust her performance by much. Mizuki worked with the staff to help portray Saya's strained condition and deliberate isolation from others after the trauma of the series' events, although the sense of love still formed a strong part of Saya's character. Hashimoto's role as Mana was her first role in an anime movie, which proved challenging as Hashimoto needed to <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new work environment, in particular performing convincingly without acting physically. She accepted the part based on her liking for CLAMP's manga work, recording all her lines separate {{from the rest of the}} cast. Fukuyama voiced Watanuki, making a cameo appearance from CLAMP's manga series xxxHolic. For the character's role in The Last Dark, Fukuyama needed to portray Watanuki as a mature character despite not aging from his appearance in xxxHolic.|$|E

25|$|The {{players had}} {{had little time}} to rest after a tough indoor season and the team and its {{management}} also had to <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> number of rule changes. First, the league had agreed to FIFA's demands that offside rule should apply from the half-way line and not the NASL's 35-yard line as had been the case since the leagues inception. Second, the league insisted that clubs have at least four North Americans on the field at any one time. The Sting had sufficient players to do so but was left with a surfeit of foreign stars and David Huson and John Tyma– who had both played their part in the 1981 success– were traded to other teams.|$|E

However, Google has been working on an algorithm with the purpose of eliminating the need for pre-programmed maps and instead, creating a device that would be able to <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> variety of new surroundings. Some self-driving cars are not equipped with steering wheels or brakes, so there has also been research focused on creating an algorithm that is capable of maintaining a safe environment for the passengers in the vehicle through awareness of speed and driving conditions.|$|E

500|$|Gatlif's quest [...] {{began in}} 1970 when he {{approached}} Matéo Maximoff, a French writer of Romani ethnicity. The two went to Montreuil {{to interview the}} Roman there who refused to discuss the subject. Gatlif was also researching the Justes, the French who attempted to shield the Romani from persecution. Following former French President Jacques Chirac's efforts to honour the Justes, Gatlif came across Yvette Lundy, a former schoolteacher in Gionges, La Marne, who had been deported for forging documents for the Romani. Gatlif came across an anecdote by Jacques Sigot, a historian who has documented the Porajmos, which would later help with the story. The anecdote is about a Romani family saved from {{being sent to the}} camp at Montreuil-Bellay by a French lawyer who sold them his home for a single franc. Unable to <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> stationary lifestyle, the family took to the streets, which led to their arrest in northern France and eventual incarceration in the Auschwitz concentration camp.|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1949, Robinson turned to Hall of Famer George Sisler, working as an advisor to the Dodgers, for batting help. At Sisler's suggestion, Robinson spent hours at a batting tee, {{learning}} {{to hit the ball}} to right field. Sisler taught Robinson to anticipate a fastball, on the theory that it is easier to subsequently <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> slower curveball. Robinson also noted that [...] "Sisler showed me how to stop lunging, how to check my swing until the last fraction of a second". The tutelage helped Robinson raise his batting average from [...]296 in 1948 to [...]342 in 1949. In addition to his improved batting average, Robinson stole 37 bases that season, was second place in the league for both doubles and triples, and registered 124 runs batted in with 122 runs scored. For the performance Robinson earned the Most Valuable Player Award for the National League. Baseball fans also voted Robinson as the starting second baseman for the 1949 All-Star Game—the first All-Star Game to include black players.|$|E

2500|$|Ambiguities in {{the terms}} {{disorder}} and chaos, which usually have meanings directly opposed to equilibrium, contribute to widespread confusion and hamper comprehension of entropy for most students.

A recently developed educational approach avoids ambiguous terms and describes such spreading out of energy as dispersal, which leads to loss of the differentials required for work even though the total energy remains constant {{in accordance with the}} first law of thermodynamics (compare discussion in next section).
