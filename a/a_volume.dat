He has published essays in multiple academic art journals, contributed to Grove Art Online, and co-edited <b>a</b> <b>volume</b> on independent African art initiatives.|$|E
5|$|At an {{estimated}} , IK Pegasi B {{is considered to}} be a high-mass white dwarf. Although its radius has not been observed directly, it can be estimated from known theoretical relationships between the mass and radius of white dwarfs, giving a value of about 0.60% of the Sun's radius. (A different source gives a value of 0.72%, so there remains some uncertainty in this result.) Thus this star packs a mass greater than the Sun into <b>a</b> <b>volume</b> roughly the size of the Earth, giving an indication of this object's extreme density.|$|E

5|$|Cerium has a {{variable}} electronic structure. The {{energy of the}} 4f electron is nearly {{the same as that}} of the outer 5d and 6s electrons that are delocalized in the metallic state, and only a small amount of energy is required to change the relative occupancy of these electronic levels. This gives rise to dual valence states. For example, <b>a</b> <b>volume</b> change of about 10% occurs when cerium is subjected to high pressures or low temperatures. It appears that the valence changes from about 3 to 4 when it is cooled or compressed.|$|E
