Large areas of already threatened tropical rainforest are often cleared to make way for palm oil plantations, especially in Southeast Asia, where enforcement of forest protection laws is lacking.

A fermentation inhibitor, NaF, was used in combination with extended <b>anaerobic</b> <b>treatments.</b> The observed frequency of aberrations after the combined treatments was generally higher and considerably less variable. Although other hypotheses might account for the NaF effect, the hypothesis most compatible with the evidence is that the effect is due to energy deprivation.

50|$|Anaerobic MBRs (sometimes {{abbreviated}} AnMBR) {{were introduced}} in the 1980s in South Africa and currently see a renaissance in research. However, anaerobic processes are normally used when a low cost treatment is required that enables energy recovery but does not achieve advanced treatment (low carbon removal, no nutrients removal). In contrast, membrane-based technologies enable advanced treatment (disinfection), but at high energy cost. Therefore, the combination of both can only be economically viable if a compact process for energy recovery is desired, or when disinfection is required after <b>anaerobic</b> <b>treatment</b> (cases of water reuse with nutrients).

50|$|By using palm biomass to {{generate}} renewable energy, fuels and biodegradable products, both the energy balance and the {{greenhouse gas emissions}} balance for palm biodiesel is improved. For every tonne of palm oil produced from fresh fruit bunches, a farmer harvests around 6 tonnes of waste palm fronds, 1 tonne of palm trunks, 5 tonnes of empty fruit bunches, 1 tonne of press fiber (from the mesocarp of the fruit), half a tonne of palm kernel endocarp, 250 kg of palm kernel press cake, and 100 tonnes of palm oil mill effluent. Some oil palm plantations incinerate biomass {{to generate}} power for palm oil mills. Some other oil palm plantations yield large amount of biomass that can be recycled into medium density fibreboards and light furniture. In efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, scientists treat palm oil mill effluent to extract biogas.

40|$|Abstract—The {{estimation}} of overall on-site and off-site greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by {{wastewater treatment plants}} revealed that in <b>anaerobic</b> and hybrid <b>treatment</b> systems greater emissions result from off-site processes compared to on-site processes. However, in aerobic treatment systems, onsite processes make a higher contribution to the overall GHG emissions. The total GHG emissions were estimated to be 1. 6, 3. 3 and 3. 8 kg CO 2 -e/kg BOD in the aerobic, <b>anaerobic</b> and hybrid <b>treatment</b> systems, respectively. In the aerobic treatment system without the recovery {{and use of the}} generated biogas, the off-site GHG emissions were 0. 65 kg CO 2 -e/kg BOD, accounting for 40. 2 % of the overall GHG emissions. This value changed to 2. 3 and 2. 6 kg CO 2 -e/kg BOD, and accounted for 69. 9 % and 68. 1 % of the overall GHG emissions in the <b>anaerobic</b> and hybrid <b>treatment</b> systems, respectively. The increased off-site GHG emissions in the <b>anaerobic</b> and hybrid <b>treatment</b> systems are mainly due to material usage and energy demand in these systems.

This study examined the microbial potential for odor production and odor consumption in two soils from a cattle production facility in central Nebraska. The two soils tested were collected from a feedlot pen and a runoff ditch below the pen and contained high- and low-fecal matter content, respectively. These soils were tested for their ability to produce and consume a mixture of VFA and aromatic compounds (phenols and indoles) under aerobic, fermentative, and anaerobic respiratory conditions, with NO 3 -, Fe(III), Mn(IV), and SO 42 - 2 ̆ 6 #;serving as anaerobic terminal electron acceptors, over a 6 -wk incubation. The pen soil had greater (P = 2 ̆ 6 #; 0. 05) initial total VFA content (40 μmol/g soil) and produced more VFA during incubation than the feedlot ditch soil, whereas total aromatic compound concentrations were not significantly different between soils. The general pattern of odor compound accumulation and consumption did not differ between soils. Oxygen and nitrate treatments produced very little VFA and consumed acetate more rapidly than the other treatments, which produced large quantities of short-chain VFA and consumed acetate only after all other VFA were consumed. When VFA and aromatic compound consumption was compared across all the treatments, aerobic incubation proved most effective, and all compounds were rapidly consumed by the second day of incubation. Of the <b>anaerobic</b> <b>treatments</b> examined, nitrate proved most effective, followed by Fe, with VFA consumed by d 5 and 21, respectively. Anaerobic incubation with sulfate produced more VFA than the fermentative incubation, and anaerobic incubation with oxidized Mn produced the largest quantities of VFA, which remained high throughout the six-wk incubation. Aromatic compounds were more easily consumed aerobically and were only slowly consumed in the <b>anaerobic</b> <b>treatments.</b> We conclude from this study that cattle feedlot soils possessed a varying, potentially exploitable capacity for odor consumption when alternate electron acceptors were available...|$|R
