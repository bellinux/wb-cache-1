5|$|Dynamism of a Dog on <b>a</b> <b>Leash</b> (Italian: Dinamismo di un cane al guinzaglio), {{sometimes}} called Dog on <b>a</b> <b>Leash</b> or Leash in Motion, is a 1912 painting by Italian Futurist painter Giacomo Balla. It {{was influenced by}} the artist's fascination with chronophotograpic studies of animals in motion. It is considered one of his best-known works, {{and one of the most}} important works in Futurism, though it received mixed critical reviews. The painting has been in the collection of the Albright–Knox Art Gallery since 1984.|$|E
5|$|The {{decomposition}} of movement into moments in time which Balla created in Dynamism of a Dog on <b>a</b> <b>Leash</b> likely inspired the photodynamic technique of Futurist photographer Anton Giulio Bragaglia.|$|E

5|$|A 2002 {{research}} paper on machine vision by computer scientists Roman Goldenberg, Ron Kimmel, Ehud Rivlin, and Michael Rudzsky used Futurism's techniques of motion, as embodied by Dynamism of a Dog on <b>a</b> <b>Leash,</b> {{to illustrate the}} mathematical representation of periodic motion using {{a small number of}} eigenshapes.|$|E
5|$|All {{motorized}} {{vehicles are}} prohibited, {{but it is}} permitted to bring canoes and other non-motorized boats, as well as skiing during winter. Walking and tenting is permitted everywhere. Berries and mushrooms can be harvested for personal use. Hunting and fishing is also permitted with a hunting or fishing license. Dogs may be brought along, but must be in <b>a</b> <b>leash</b> between 1 April and 20 August. Hikers must show special consideration regarding vegetation, animal life and cultural heritage.|$|E
5|$|Dog racing was {{originally}} {{an extension of}} hare coursing. Whippets began to be bred to race in the mid-nineteenth century. The first form of the sport was a rudimentary form of coursing known as 'ragging', and dogs who participated {{were said to be}} 'trained to the rag'. Dogs were kept on <b>a</b> <b>leash</b> by a person known as a slip, who was frequently also the race judge. The slip would release the dogs from their collars at the same time, and they would race towards their owners, who were standing {{at the opposite end of}} the track waving towels.|$|E

5|$|Neither the dog's grave nor mummy {{have been}} recovered. The tomb {{in which the}} tablet was {{unearthed}} is in Cemetery G 2100 in Giza West Field, close to {{the western side of}} the Great Pyramid of Giza (Pyramid of Khufu/Kheops). The white limestone tablet measures 54.2×28.2×23.2cm (21.3×11.1×9.1in) and is inscribed with ten vertical rows of hieroglyphs, separated from each other by vertical lines. Part of <b>a</b> <b>leash</b> is visible on the upper-right corner, suggesting that the tablet displayed an image of Abuwtiyuw with his owner.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} a fast motion night view of several skyscrapers located in Houston. It {{transitions}} to quick looks of various houses and people. Scenes filmed at the SLAB parade, an annual celebration of car culture in Houston were also featured in the clip set in slow motion. Houston residents posing for the camera are featured throughout the video as well as scenes of children playing football. During several scenes, Beyoncé is seen lip-syncing the song wearing a white-hooded fur mink coat and a matching one piece {{in front of a}} tumbledown house holding a pit bull on <b>a</b> <b>leash.</b> This scene was filmed in the suburb of Brunswick, during her Melbourne, Australia part of The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour and is the only scene from the music video, to be filmed outside of Houston. During another scene, she is seen wearing a jersey of the Houston Rockets with number 13, by James Harden. Beyoncé also appears at a gas station filling the fuel tank of a car and later goes to the streets in it.|$|E
25|$|Surfing, {{like all}} water sports, carries the {{inherent}} danger of drowning. Anyone {{at any age}} can learn to surf, but {{should have at least}} intermediate swimming skills. Although the board assists a surfer in staying buoyant, it can become separated from the user. <b>A</b> <b>leash,</b> attached to the ankle or knee, can keep a board from being swept away, but does not keep a rider on the board or above water. In some cases, possibly including the drowning of professional surfer Mark Foo, <b>a</b> <b>leash</b> can even be a cause of drowning by snagging on a reef or other object and holding the surfer underwater. By keeping the surfboard close to the surfer during a wipeout, <b>a</b> <b>leash</b> also increases the chances that the board may strike the rider, which could knock him or her unconscious and lead to drowning. A fallen rider's board can become trapped in larger waves, and if the rider is attached by <b>a</b> <b>leash,</b> he or she can be dragged for long distances underwater. Surfers should be careful to remain in smaller surf until they have acquired the advanced skills and experience necessary to handle bigger waves and more challenging conditions. However, even world-class surfers have drowned in extremely challenging conditions.|$|E

25|$|This breed is gentle, and is tireless when {{following}} a scent. Because of its strong tracking instinct, {{it can be}} willful and somewhat difficult to obedience train and handle on <b>a</b> <b>leash.</b> Bloodhounds have an affectionate and even-tempered nature with humans, making excellent family pets. However, like any pet, they require supervision when around small children.|$|E
25|$|Associative {{learning}} in animal behaviour is any learning {{process in which}} a new response becomes associated with a particular stimulus. The first studies of associative learning were made by Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. Examples of associative {{learning in}}clude when a goldfish swims to the water surface when a human is going to feed it, or the excitement of a dog whenever it sees <b>a</b> <b>leash</b> as a prelude for a walk.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> board <b>leash</b> that {{attaches}} {{the board}} to the kitesurfer's leg or harness is used by some riders. However, many kitesurfing schools discourage the use of board leashes due {{to the risk of}} recoil, where the leash can yank {{the board to}} impact the rider, which can result in serious injury or even death. Generally, kitesurfers that use <b>a</b> board <b>leash</b> will also wear a helmet to help protect against this.|$|R

The player assumes the role of Frank and directs The Maw—which can take on the abilities of objects and fauna it consumes—via <b>a</b> <b>leash.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Medieval {{hunting the}} typical {{use of the}} Bloodhound was as a ‘limer’, or ‘lyam-hound’, that is a dog handled on <b>a</b> <b>leash</b> or ‘lyam’, to find the hart or boar before it was hunted by the pack hounds (raches). It was prized {{for its ability to}} hunt the cold scent of an {{individual}} animal, and, though it did not usually take part in the kill, it was given a special reward from the carcass.|$|E
25|$|In November 1945 Fala {{was hospitalized}} {{for a week}} after being {{attacked}} at the family's Hyde Park estate by Elliott Roosevelt's 135-pound bull mastiff, Blaze. Fala had been staying with Margaret Suckley and visited Hyde Park. He was on <b>a</b> <b>leash</b> when the larger dog jumped on him, slashing his back and right eye. The attack ended when someone struck Blaze with a rock and dazed him. Blaze tested negative for rabies, but was still euthanized as a precaution against future attacks.|$|E
5000|$|Secrets of the Slavers Stockade was {{published}} by TSR in 1981 as a thirty-two page booklet with an outer folder, and was written by Harold Johnson and Tom Moldvay.

25|$|Day's {{interest}} in animal welfare and related issues apparently dates to her teen years. While recovering from an automobile accident, {{she took her}} dog Tiny for a walk without <b>a</b> <b>leash.</b> Tiny ran {{into the street and}} was killed by a passing car. Day later confessed guilt and loneliness about Tiny's untimely death. In 1971, she co-founded Actors and Others for Animals, and appeared in a series of newspaper advertisements denouncing the wearing of fur, alongside Mary Tyler Moore, Angie Dickinson, and Jayne Meadows. Day's friend, Cleveland Amory, wrote about these events in Man Kind? Our Incredible War on Wildlife (1974).|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} common breeds used in Russia is the German Shepherd. This is mainly because these dogs are adapted to the climate of the country. Attack dogs have been used for a long time, off and on for foot patrolling. These dogs are kept on <b>a</b> <b>leash</b> at all times and are {{required}} to wear a muzzle unless the dog is needed to pursue and detain a suspect. These dogs must remain calm, docile, and unfazed by crowds or noise. Russian Police Dogs may react to any and all stimuli only if they are ordered to do so by their handler. They are a common sight in the public and are often unnerving to the public. German shepherds are also used for tasks such as seeking dangerous fugitives, tracking, and were ultimately chosen as the all-purpose police and army breed. This has remained common in most Soviet Union Successor States.|$|E
25|$|Dachs is German for badger, a {{term used}} for hunting dogs with short legs. The name Dachsbracke may reflect that the Dachsbracke dogs were bred down in size by {{crossbreeding}} long-legged Bracken with the Dachshund. Historically, the term Bracke {{was used in}} German to mean the scenthounds. Brack is an old Low German word for a coastal marsh periodically inundated by storm surges with salt water (related to the English word brackish). In Europe, scenthounds are usually separated into running hounds (free running packs, which either drive the game back to the hunter, or the hunter follows as they run, or the hunter waits until the dogs' cries communicate that game has been found and held, and then goes to that spot) or leash hounds (which follow the game or track wounded or dead game while being held on <b>a</b> <b>leash</b> by the hunter.) The Bracke are usually used as running hounds, in packs, to hunt rabbits or foxes in a type of hunt called Brackade. The Dachsbracke are used for hunting today mainly in Scandinavia and in alpine regions.|$|E
