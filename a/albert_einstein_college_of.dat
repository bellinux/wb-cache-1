He relocated to New York in 1965, where he first worked under a paid fellowship in neurochemistry and neuropathology at the <b>Albert</b> <b>Einstein</b> <b>College</b> <b>of</b> Medicine. Upon realising that the neuro-research career he envisioned for himself would be a poor fit, in 1966 he began serving as neurologist at Beth Abraham Hospital's chronic-care facility in the Bronx. While there, he worked with a group of survivors of the 1920s sleeping sickness encephalitis lethargica, who had been unable to move on their own for decades. His treatment of those patients became the basis of his book Awakenings. In the period from 1966 to 1991 he was a neurological consultant to various New York City-area nursing homes (especially those operated by Little Sisters of the Poor), hospitals, and at the Bronx Psychiatric Center.|$|E

30|$|Bob Sweet was {{in charge}} of the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) beamline X 12 C at Brookhaven. I {{actually}} met Bob personally more than ten years ago when I paid a visit to David Eisenberg’s lab at UCLA in 1980. Bob was David’s postdoctoral fellow then who hosted my visit. We had a very interesting talk on his project. With Bob as a host at NSLS, I felt very comfortable. He was friendly and introduced us to his facility, after Ellis and I safely arrived and most of crystals seemed to survive. On the site also was a group from <b>Albert</b> <b>Einstein</b> <b>College</b> led by Jim Sacchettini, another X-ray crystallographer with whom Ellis had previously established a collaboration. That was the very early days when protein crystallographers just began to freeze protein crystals to collect diffraction data at around − 140 °C. To protein crystallographers, the synchrotron radiation source was like a double-edged sword. On one hand, the synchrotron X-ray source was so powerful, it had made possible the data collection of those weakly diffracting crystals like TCR. On the other hand, the X-ray was so strong that it quickly damaged these fragile crystals before any complete data set could be finished. To collect a data set at − 140 °C under cold stream generated from liquid nitrogen was invented early in 1990 ’s to circumvent the problem. X-ray damage was no longer a headache. Bob had a well set-up facility for all these purposes.|$|R
40|$|Exposure {{to chronic}} stress is {{frequently}} accompanied by {{cognitive and affective}} disorders in association with neurostructural adaptations. Chronic stress was previously shown to trigger Alzheimer's-like neuropathology, which is characterized by Tau hyper-phosphorylation and missorting into dendritic spines followed by memory deficits. Here, we demonstrate that stress-driven hippocampal deficits in wild-type mice are accompanied by synaptic missorting of Tau and enhanced Fyn/GluN 2 B-driven synaptic signaling. In contrast, mice lacking Tau [Tau knockout (Tau-KO) mice] do not exhibit stress-induced pathological behaviors and atrophy of hippocampal dendrites or deficits of hippocampal connectivity. These findings implicate Tau as an essential mediator of the adverse effects of stress on brain structure and function.
