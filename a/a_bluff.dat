5|$|Another {{important}} form {{of protective}} mimicry is Müllerian mimicry, discovered by and {{named after the}} naturalist Fritz Müller. In Müllerian mimicry both model and mimic are aposematic, so mimicry may be mutual, does not necessarily constitute <b>a</b> <b>bluff</b> or deception, and as in the wasps and bees may involve many species in a mimicry ring.|$|E

5|$|Some {{animals such as}} many moths, mantises and grasshoppers, have a {{repertory}} {{of threatening}} or startling behaviour, such as suddenly displaying conspicuous eyespots or patches of bright and contrasting colours, so as to scare off or momentarily distract a predator. This gives the prey animal an opportunity to escape. The behaviour is deimatic (startling) rather than aposematic as these insects are palatable to predators, so the warning colours are <b>a</b> <b>bluff,</b> not an honest signal.|$|E
5|$|The Army Corps of Engineers {{commenced}} work on The Dalles Dam in 1952 {{and completed}} it five years later. On March 10, 1957, hundreds of observers looked on as a rising Lake Celilo rapidly silenced the falls, submerged fishing platforms, and consumed {{the village of}} Celilo, ending an age-old existence for those who lived there. A small Native American community exists today at nearby Celilo Village, on <b>a</b> <b>bluff</b> overlooking the former location of the falls.|$|E
5|$|Henry's men, {{the entire}} left wing, descended <b>a</b> <b>bluff</b> into {{the midst of}} several hundred Sauk and Fox warriors, and a desperate bayonet and musket battle followed.

The battle continued for 30 minutes before Atkinson came up with Dodge's center element, cutting off escape {{for many of the}} remaining Native warriors. Some warriors managed to escape the fight to a willow island, which was being peppered with canister shot and gunfire by Warrior.|$|E

50|$|A {{peculiar}} incident happened {{three days}} before the bout when a newspaper published a headline saying Kimura was not a Japanese martial artist, but <b>a</b> <b>bluffer</b> of Japanese-Peruvian ascendance (or Cambodian, according to Kimura's account). Masahiko was forced to present his passport at the Japanese embassy to get them to rectify.|$|R
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 September, Wolfe's army formed a line first with {{their backs to the}} river, then spread out across the Plains with its right {{anchored}} by the bluff along the St. Lawrence and its left by <b>a</b> <b>bluff</b> and thick wood above the St. Charles River. While the regular French forces were approaching from Beauport and Quebec, the Canadian militia and native sharpshooters engaged the British left flank, sheltering in the trees and scrub; the militia held these positions throughout the battle and fell back on this line during the general retreat, eventually holding the bridge over the St. Charles River.|$|E
5|$|The American {{prisoners were}} quickly {{returned}} to the United States, most by plane. Those who were still sick or weakened remained at American hospitals to continue to recuperate. On February11, 1945, 280 POWs left Leyte aboard the transport USS General A.E. Anderson bound for San Francisco via Hollandia, New Guinea. In an effort to counter the improved American morale, Japanese propaganda radio announcers broadcast to American soldiers that submarines, ships, and planes were hunting the General Anderson. The threats proved to be <b>a</b> <b>bluff,</b> and the ship safely arrived in San Francisco Bay on March8, 1945.|$|E
5|$|The {{big game}} starts with six players, {{including}} Howard and the Kid, with Shooter playing as he deals and Lady Fingers relieving him whenever Shooter needs a break. In {{the first big}} confrontation between the Kid and Howard, the Kid is short $2,000 and Slade steps in to stake him. Several hours later, Howard busts a player called Pig, perhaps with <b>a</b> <b>bluff,</b> and the remaining players take a break. Following the break, Lady Fingers, who has been delighting in needling Howard all evening, takes over as dealer and continues to needle him.|$|E

50|$|A player {{may benefit}} {{in the long}} run {{if he or she is}} {{discovered}} to be <b>bluffing.</b> <b>A</b> player may intentionally declare to be pleased with a bad hand and bet low for the sole purpose of being discovered. This may benefit the player later if he has a good hand and wants keep other players from folding. The downside of this strategy is that <b>a</b> <b>bluffer</b> may have to wait a long time before he or she can successfully trap other players with this strategy.|$|R
5|$|As Sercey left Batavia {{he turned}} eastward along the {{northern}} coast of Java to avoid the British commander in the region, Admiral Peter Rainier who was escorting four ships through the Straits of Malacca to the west. However six East Indiamen were sailing to transit the Bali Strait {{on their way to}} China. On 28 January, {{at the entrance to the}} Strait, Sercey's squadron and the East Indiamen met. The EIC Commodore, James Farquharson, captain of , knew that if he fled the French would rapidly overwhelm his ships so he decided to try <b>a</b> <b>bluff.</b> He would attempt to lead Sercey into believing that the convoy was formed not from lightly armed East Indiamen, but from the powerful ships of the line that the Indiamen resembled. Farquharson ordered his ships to advance in line of battle.|$|E
5|$|Fort Greble was an American Civil War-era Union {{fortification}} {{constructed as}} part of the defenses of Washington, D.C. during that war. Named for First Lieutenant John Trout Greble, the first West Point graduate killed in the U.S. Civil War, it protected the junction of the Anacostia and Potomac rivers, and from its position on <b>a</b> <b>bluff</b> in the Congress Heights, precluded any bombardment of the Washington Navy Yard and southeastern portions of the city. It was supported by Fort Carroll to the northeast and Fort Foote to the south. It never fired a shot during the war, and after a brief stint as a U.S. Army Signal Corps training facility, was abandoned and the land returned to its natural state. As of July 2007, the site of the fort is a community park.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and Romney Depot to Depot Valley brought {{residential}} development on the hilltops {{to the west and}} east of Valley. On September27, 1911, George Edward Harmison (1863–1916) conducted a public auction of Valley View farm's fields atop Yellow Banks overlooking the South Branch Potomac River. The land was located atop the hill to the west of Valley. Harmison subdivided the fields into lots, and the planned development was known as the Valley View Addition to Romney. Harmison sold 21 of the land lots at the auction, and several lots were sold privately. A free lot was given to J.H. Newhouse, and Harmison set aside two lots on <b>a</b> <b>bluff</b> for the site of a future hospital, which he planned to deed to any entity willing to build one.|$|E
