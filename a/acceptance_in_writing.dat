It was a matter which appealed to the commonest news-boy on the street, and its meaning once made plain, the principle which gave vitality to the meaning was ready for enunciation and was assured of intelligent <b>acceptance.</b> <b>In</b> <b>writing</b> the [...] "Drapier's Letters," [...] he had, to use his own words, seasonably raised a spirit among the Irish people, and that spirit he continued to refresh, until when he told them in his Fourth Letter, [...] "by the Laws of God, of Nature, of Nations, and of your Country, you are, and ought to be, as free a people as your brethren in England," [...] the country rose as one man to the appeal. Neither the suavities of Carteret nor the intrigues of Walpole had any chance against the set opposition which met them. The question to be settled was taken away from the consideration of ministers, and out of the seclusion of Cabinets {{into the hands of the}} People, and before the public eye. There was but one way in which it could be settled--the way of the people's will--and it went that way. It does not at all matter that Walpole finally had his way--that the King's mistress pocketed her douceur, and that Wood retired satisfied with the ample compensation allowed him. What does matter is that, for the first time in Irish History, a spirit of national life was breathed into an almost denationalized people. Beneath the lean and starved ribs of death Swift planted a soul; it is for this that Irishmen will ever revere his memory.|$|E
30|$|The verdict {{attracted}} great {{attention in}} Germany, as it sparked a new debate regarding a {{changing of the}} Embryo Protection Act. In this context, since late autumn 2010, three draft laws are being discussed across the parliamentary groups. The first of them provides a total ban on PGD (Schmidt et al. 2011). The second proposal limits PGD to cases of risk of miscarriage, stillbirth or severe genetic defects (Hintze et al. 2010). To prevent abuse consultation is to be mandatory, and an ethics committee has to agree. The woman has to express her <b>acceptance</b> <b>in</b> <b>writing,</b> and PGD is to be made only by licensed centres. The third draft law does not allow examination for possible genetic defects and limits PGD to cases of threat of miscarriage or stillbirth only (Röspel et al. 2010). In January 2011, the National Academy of Science has expressed its support for PGD (Nationale Akademie der Wissenschaften 2011). The decision of the German Ethic council was ambivalent. In March 2011, it decided in favour of PGD with the narrowest majority possible (Ethikrat 2011), and a votum of the parliament is expected {{in the summer of}} 2011 (Beck-Online 2011). Considering the volatile nature of the subject, it seems questionable whether this ambitious schedule can be kept.|$|E
40|$|One of this editor’s pet peeves {{has been}} the word utilize. On {{discovering}} that an author likes that word, I have tended to simply “find and replace ” all instances of it with use. My reasoning is that use improves clar-ity by {{reducing the number of}} letters. The less a reader has to process, the easier it is to read and comprehend the writing. In my mind, utilize belonged in the wordiness column just below at this juncture—neither was prudent. Working at a university that seeks to apply a consistent style in all its documents, I am compelled to follow the set conventions in the university style guide. Regarding utilize, the guide says, “Bureaucratic form of use; use use. ” 1 I had been in complete agreement for years, arguing that I would never let a utilize go through on my watch. My obsession and disdain for this word, and perhaps a need to prove myself right, led me to write this column, but I may have unexpectedly changed my mind about utilize. In fact, refusing to use utilize, I learned, was prob-ably detrimental to my goal in editing: to improve clarity. History of Utilize Utilize was rarely used before 1858, accord-ing to the Oxford English Dictionary, which lists its first recording as 1807, in its British-spelled form of utilise. 2 It appears in Joel Barlow’s epic poem The Columbiad, which traces American history from its dis-covery by Columbus. 3 Although the poem is written in English, a famous Scottish review equates its language to an undis-tinguishable American dialect, and in the reviewer’s opinion, Barlow bastardizes the language to the point that he “will not be the Homer of his country”. 4 Although many contemporary American critics praised the work, 5, 6 other Americans also felt that it was “disappointing”. 7 In particu-lar, American literary historian Moses Coit Tyler noted Barlow’s unusual language. 8 We might read into these responses that many literary scholars felt that it was pre-tentious for a writer from a land so young to include such “new ” words as utilize. On the other hand, because words like utilize had not yet come into <b>acceptance</b> <b>in</b> <b>writing,</b> it might have been considered vernacular slang inappropriate for such an honorable, high form of poetry. In that case, seasoned readers might have lost respect for the author...|$|E

50|$|As may be {{the case}} with other {{contracts}}, real estate contracts may be formed by one party making an offer and another party accepting the offer. To be enforceable, the offers and <b>acceptances</b> must be <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> (Statute of Frauds, Common Law)and signed by the parties agreeing to the contract. Often, the party making the offer prepares a written real estate contract, signs it, and transmits it to the other party who would accept the offer by signing the contract. As with all other types of legal offers, the other party may accept the offer, reject it (in which case the offer is terminated), make a counteroffer (in which case the original offer is terminated), or not respond to the offer (in which case the offer terminates by the expiration date in it). Before the offer (or counteroffer) is accepted, the offering (or countering) party can withdraw it. A counteroffer may be countered with yet another offer, and a counteroffering process may go on indefinitely between the parties.|$|R

500|$|Screenwriter Robert Florey wrote a {{treatment}} entitled The New Adventures of Frankenstein— The Monster Lives!, {{but it was}} rejected without comment early in 1932. Universal staff writer Tom Reed wrote {{a treatment}} under the title The Return of Frankenstein, a title retained until filming began. Following its <b>acceptance</b> <b>in</b> 1933, Reed <b>wrote</b> a full script that was submitted to the Hays office for review. The script passed its review, but Whale, who by then had been contracted to direct, complained that [...] "it stinks to heaven". L. G. Blochman and Philip MacDonald were the next writers assigned, but Whale also found their work unsatisfactory. In 1934, Whale set John L. Balderston to work on yet another version, and {{it was he who}} returned to an incident from the novel in which the creature demands a mate. In the novel Frankenstein creates a mate, but destroys it without bringing it to life. Balderston also created the Mary Shelley prologue. After several months Whale was still not satisfied with Balderston's work and handed the project to playwright William J. Hurlbut and Edmund Pearson. The final script, combining elements of a number of these versions, was submitted for Hays office review in November 1934. Kim Newman reports that Whale planned to make Elizabeth the heart donor for the bride, but film historian Scott MacQueen states that Whale never had such an intention.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{design of}} {{hardware}} systems is a challenging and erroneous task where about 70 % {{of the effort}} in designing these systems is spent on verification. In general, testing and verification are usually tasks that are being applied as a postprocess to the implementation. In this paper, we propose a new design flow based on Behavior Driven Development (BDD), an agile technique {{for the development of}} software <b>in</b> which <b>acceptance</b> tests <b>written</b> <b>in</b> natural language play a central role and are the starting point in the design flow. We advance the flow such that the specifics that arise when modeling hardware are taken into account. Furthermore, we present a technique that allows for the automatic generalization of test cases to properties that are suitable for formal verification. This allows the designer to apply formal verification techniques based on test cases without specifying properties. We implemented our approach and evaluated the flow for an illustrative example that successfully demonstrates the advantages of the proposed flow. I...|$|R
