The experiment included an electron gun consisting of a heated filament that released thermally excited electrons, which were then accelerated through a potential difference giving them a certain amount of kinetic energy, towards the nickel crystal. To avoid collisions of the electrons with other molecules on their way towards the surface, the experiment was conducted in a vacuum chamber. To measure the number of electrons that were scattered at different angles, a faraday cup electron detector that could be moved on an <b>arc</b> <b>path</b> about the crystal was used.

5000|$|An {{electric}} arc {{over the surface}} of plastics causes their degradation. A conductive carbon-rich track tends to form in the <b>arc</b> <b>path,</b> negatively influencing their insulation properties. The arc susceptibility is tested according to ASTM D495, by point electrodes and continuous and intermittent arcs; it is measured in seconds required to form a track that is conductive under high-voltage low-current conditions. Some materials are less susceptible to degradation than others. For example, polytetrafluoroethylene has arc resistance of about 200 seconds (3.3 minutes). From thermosetting plastics, alkyds and melamine resins are better than phenolic resins. Polyethylenes have arc resistance of about 150 seconds; polystyrenes and polyvinyl chlorides have relatively low resistance of about 70 seconds. Plastics can be formulated to emit gases with arc-extinguishing properties; these are known as arc-extinguishing plastics.|$|E

We first consider a growth rate with substrate saturation and product inhibition, and we prove that the optimal strategy is fill and wait (bang-bang). We then investigate the case of the Jin growth rate which takes into account substrate and product inhibition. For this type of growth function, we can prove the existence of singular <b>arc</b> <b>paths</b> defining singular strategies. Several configurations are addressed depending on the parameter set. For each case, we provide an optimal feedback control of the problem (of type bang-bang or bang-singular-bang). These results are obtained gathering the initial system into a planar one by using conservation laws. Thanks to Pontryagin maximum principle, Green's theorem, and properties of the switching function, we obtain the optimal synthesis.

The success rate of a SPAR operation {{is dependent on the}} time required to extinguish the secondary arc and to rebuild the dielectric strength of the de-ionized <b>arc</b> <b>path.</b> The extinction time of the secondary arc depends on the magnitude of the secondary arc current and the recovery voltage. Without a compensation scheme, a SPAR operation will be unsuccessful in a long EHV transmission line. Based on a three phase reduced system model, the performance of the main parameters of SPAR operations, the secondary arc current and the recovery voltage were analyzed. Detailed sensitivity analysis of SPAR operation in a long single circuit 500 kV transmission line was investigated for different line transposition scheme, line length, prefault line load and fault location using EMTDC software. A review of SPAR compensation methods is also included. Obtained results indicate a strong correlations between conductor configuration, line transposition schemes, line length, prefault line loading, fault location and compensation scheme, and the secondary arc current and the recovery voltage of SPAR operations...|$|E

40|$|A {{recirculating}} accelerator accelerates {{the beam}} by passing through accelerating cavities multiple times. An FFAG recirculating accelerator uses a single arc {{to connect the}} linacs together, as opposed to multiple arcs for the different energies. For most scenarios using high-frequency RF, it is impractical to change the phase of the RF on each pass, at least for lower energy accelerators. Ideally, therefore, the WAG arc will be isochronous, so that the particles {{come back to the}} same phase (on-crest) on each linac pass. However, {{it is not possible to}} make the FFAG arcs isochronous (compared to the RF period) over a large energy range.

The craters produced {{on the surface}} were analysed using white light interferometry (WLI) and FIB/SEM techniques. The voltage- and current-versus-time characteristics of the arc were registered using an oscilloscope. The SEM observations showed that the arc root constricts with decreasing current and they {{pointed out that the}} oxides have a strong influence on the arc mobility at the surface. On Pt/MeO composites only a single depression is formed while on pure platinum, several craters are produced by the displacement of the arc. On silver and its composites, the numerous small craters and the <b>arc</b> <b>path</b> indicate high arc mobility. It was observed that the greater the arc mobility, the shallower the crater. Observations with FIB/SEM dual beam showed that the oxides melt and formed large plates on the crater surface for most of the Pt/MeO or they partially disappeared like for Pt/SnO 2, Ag/SnO 2 and Ag/CdO (vaporization, sublimation). The melting of refractory oxides indicates that the arc cathode root temperature should be very high.

40|$|Propeller {{inspection}} {{is mandatory}} for the safe operation of aircraft. Non-contact damage evaluation on rotating structures requires dedicated measurement techniques. We {{report on a}} non-contacting stroboscopic technique that allows inspection of rotating aluminum propellers. To excite Lamb waves we used a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser in synchrony with data acquisition by a Laser Doppler Vibrometer. We detected, sized, and imaged a surface breaking notch on a sample rotating at 415 rpm. The technique showed potential for automatic non-contacting damage detection on rotating structures such as helicopter blades and turbines. The samples, manufactured at the Department of Physics of the University of Helsinki were aluminum blades 130 mm x 76. 10 mm x 4 mm in size. One of them {{was used as a}} baseline while the other one had a surface breaking rectangular defect that was 5 mm x 10 mm x 2. 4 mm in size, situated 35. 10 mm {{from the center of the}} propeller. The propeller was rotated by a 12 V DC motor connected to a pulse width modulation circuit based on a 555 timer integrated circuit. To detect the movement of the rotating blade, a custom made optical gate was built by using common electronics such as blue LED, a LM 311 comparator and a blue enhanced photodiode. All electronics were built in the Electronics Research Laboratory of the Department of Physics. Using C++ programming language we designed an algorithm for scanning the moving target. The code was implemented into an Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller that was connected to a computer. The user operated the computer which controlled the microcontroller via a Labview program. Two types of scans of the samples were performed. In one type the TX scanned the blade from edge to center while the LDV pickup spot was stationary at the center. From this experiment we were able to determine the distance from the notch to the center of the blade and the length of the defect from time-of-flight measurements. The second type of scan was done by situating the LDV pickup point close to the center of the blade and the excitation point at the far side of it, close to the edge. This time we did not scan with the lasers but we divided the <b>arc</b> <b>path</b> that they follow into even steps. From this experiment we were able to determine the width of the notch as well as its depth based on time-of-flight analysis. The results agree with the expected values. Finally, by doing data selection of the delayed Lamb waves with Matlab R 2015 and Blender 2. 77 a, we were able to do image reconstruction of the notch in a 3 D model of the aluminum propeller.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{estimating}} lightning insulation strength of distribution line designs is complicated due to numerous factors. In general, classical techniques {{that account for}} air gap flashover do not apply. The fundamental reasons for these complications are still not precisely reported. Some researchers relate them to small distances between electrodes, others {{to the presence of}} wood insulation, insulator size, hardware size, shape, position of components, multiple <b>arc</b> <b>paths,</b> and probably not seen other factors. In this paper modern insulation materials used on distribution systems such as porcelain, fiber-glass reinforced plastics (FRP) and polymers and their composite combinations are considered.

The paper presents an empirical factor to estimate the flashover voltage due to lightning of composite insulators used on distribution overhead lines. The physical and the active length of composite insulators are also determined to evaluate the most effective configuration and material to be used. Factors that may affect the critical flashover voltage (CFO) of composite insulators are investigated and defined to evaluate different insulator types and material composites used.
