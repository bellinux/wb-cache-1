40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new <b>advanced</b> Call <b>Admission</b> Control(CAC) {{strategy}} involving {{for the first}} time, a bandwidth reservation scheme that {{is influenced by the}} direction attribute of a mobile terminal (MT). Aside from the Quality-of-Service (QoS) parameters, the direction attribute {{plays a key role in}} efficiently reserving resources for MTs supporting multimedia communications for different QoS classes. The framework for a direction-based CAC system is entirely distributed and may be viewed as a message passing system, where MTs inform their neighbouring base stations (BS) not only of their QoS requirements, but also of their mobility parameters. The base stations then predict future demand and reserve resources accordingly, only admitting those terminals that can be adequately supported. The bandwidth reservation scheme proposed in this paper, integrates the direction attribute into the conventional Guard Channel (GC) scheme. Simulation results prove that this new scheme offers significant improvements in both Call Blocking Probability (CBP) and bandwidth utilization, under a variety of differing traffic conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Although IEEE 802. 11 based {{wireless}} {{local area}} networks (WLANs) {{have become more}} and more popular due to low cost and easy deployment, they can only provide best effort services and do not have quality of service (QoS) supports for multimedia applications. Recently, a new standard, IEEE 802. 11 e, has been proposed, which introduces a so-called hybrid coordination function (HCF) containing two medium access mechanisms: contention-based channel access (EDCA) and controlled channel access (HCCA). In this paper, we first give a brief tutorial on the various MAC-layer QoS mechanisms provided by 802. 11 e. We show that the 802. 11 e standard provides a very powerful platform for QoS supports in WLANs. Then, we provide an extensive survey of recent <b>advances</b> in <b>admission</b> control algorithms/protocols in IEEE 802. 11 e WLANs. Our survey covers the research work of admission control for both EDCA and HCCA. We show that those new MAC-layer QoS schemes and parameters provided in EDCA and HCCA can be well utilized to fulfill the requirements of admission control so that QoS for multimedia applications can be provided in WLANs. Last, we give a summary of the design of admission control in EDCA and HCCA, and point out the remaining challenges. I...|$|R
40|$|Between 1966 and 1984, 14 {{patients}} with {{carcinoma of the}} soft palate and eight {{patients with}} a posterior oropharyngeal wall carcinoma were treated at the Netherlands Cancer Institute. In the soft palate group, the majority of patients (10) had small tumours T 1 -T 2; the median patient delay was 1 month (range 0 - 5). Eleven patients were treated with radiotherapy and three with surgery, as single treatment modalities. Tumour control was achieved in 10 patients following initial treatment. Five-year results for tumour control and overall survival were 67 % and 41 %, respectively. In the posterior wall group all patients had advanced tumours (T 3 -T 4), after a median patient delay of 4 months (range 0 - 6). Six patients were treated with radiotherapy, one with surgery only and one {{with a combination of}} these. Following the initial treatment, tumour control was achieved in half of the patients.
