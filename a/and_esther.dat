5|$|The {{following}} year, this unwieldy {{and confusing}} system {{was replaced by}} the current system in which an actress is nominated for a specific performance in a single film. Starting with the 9th ceremony held in 1937, the category was officially limited to five nominations per year. One actress has been nominated posthumously, Jeanne Eagels. Only three film characters have been nominated more than once in this category: Elizabeth I of England (two times by Cate Blanchett), Leslie Crosbie in The Letter, <b>and</b> <b>Esther</b> Blodgett in A Star Is Born. Six women on the list have received an Honorary Academy Award for their acting; they are Greta Garbo, Barbara Stanwyck, Mary Pickford, Deborah Kerr, Gena Rowlands, and Sophia Loren.|$|E

5|$|William Etty {{was born}} in Feasegate, York, on 10March 1787, the seventh child of Matthew <b>and</b> <b>Esther</b> Etty, née Calverley. Although Matthew Etty was a {{successful}} miller and baker, he bore a large family and was never financially secure. Esther Calverley's brother unexpectedly inherited the title of Squire of Hayton in 1745, nine years before Esther's birth, but disowned her following her marriage to Matthew as he considered him beneath her station. The family were strict Methodists and the young William was raised as such, although he disliked the spartan appearance of the Methodist chapel and liked to attend his Anglican parish church or York Minster when able.|$|E
5|$|Xerocomellus zelleri {{was first}} {{described}} by American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill in 1912, based on specimens he {{found on the}} campus of the University of Washington. Murrill named it Ceriomyces zelleri before switching the genus later that year to Boletus. In 1944, Walter Henry Snell thought the taxon would be more appropriate in the genus Xerocomus. In 1959, mycologists Rolf Singer, Snell <b>and</b> <b>Esther</b> A. Dick transferred the species to Boletellus, explaining that the microstructure of the trama and the faint ornamentation of the spores were inconsistent with placement in Xerocomus. American mycologist Harry D. Thiers, in his 1976 monograph on North American boletes, claimed that he failed to consistently find ornamentation on the spores of material he collected, and preferred to retain the species in Boletus. In 2011, it was moved to the genus Xerocomellus.|$|E
5|$|Australia has {{competed in}} {{cross-country}} skiing in 1952, 1960, 1968, 1980 to 1998, and since 2006. The two Australian representatives in 1952 occupied {{the last two}} places, and before 1984, no Australian finished above the bottom 15% of racers. Results have slowly improved, but most Australian entrants {{in the last two}} decades have placed in the bottom 25%. In 1992, Anthony Evans became the first Australian to place in the top half, finishing in the top 40 in two events. Australia fielded three competitors in cross-country skiing in 2006, its largest contingent in the event. Paul Murray <b>and</b> <b>Esther</b> Bottomley competed in the sprint; Clare-Louise Brumley was selected for the pursuit and 30km freestyle, but competed only in the former due to illness. Nobody broke into the top half in their respective races. At the 2010 Games, Australia had three representatives. Ben Sim came in the top half in one event, but he, Bottomley and Murray finished in the bottom 20% in their remaining four events. Australia has never competed in ski jumping, and their sole entry in Nordic combined was by Hal Nerdal in 1960, who came last.|$|E
5000|$|Fred <b>and</b> <b>Esther's</b> {{relationship}} as in-laws {{went on to}} become a major part of the series' legend, as each time Esther appeared, Fred would insult her and audiences were drawn to the show in greater numbers. Conversely, Esther's disdain for Fred stemmed back to when he and Elizabeth were dating; she had disapproved of Fred marrying her sister. He would often contort his face upon <b>Esther's</b> entrance <b>and</b> make disparaging remarks to her, comparing her with King Kong <b>and</b> Godzilla. <b>Esther</b> would refer to Fred as an [...] "old heathen." [...] Despite his stubbornness, Fred would sometimes redeem himself with acts of kindness toward Esther.|$|R
50|$|Freya {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} witches to ever walk the earth, along with Dahlia, her niece Hope <b>and</b> her mother <b>Esther.</b> However, Hope's power seems even greater than Freya's <b>and</b> <b>Esther's,</b> as she is capable of accomplishing feats even <b>Esther</b> <b>and</b> Freya could not. Even Rebekah, whose knowledge of magic was quite limited, knew that Freya was far more powerful than any other witch she had encountered. Freya knew and mastered a vast number of spells and could accomplish them at a greater degree than other witches; namely, she could locate someone despite them being protected by a cloaking spell. She could also use her magic in a fight, something that not even a Harvest witch like Davina can do.|$|R

5|$|Gerard Anthony Francis Conroy {{was born}} in Dublin to John (Jack) <b>and</b> <b>Esther</b> Conroy, {{and was one of}} ten siblings: Alphonsus (Ollie), Laurence (Lar), John (Donny), Rita, Peter, Michael, Vincent, Paul, and Marie. Christened as Gerard, he soon became known by the name Terry as he could not {{pronounce}} 'Gerard' as a young child. His mother held two jobs: as a factory worker and an office cleaner. The family lived in the suburb of Cabra, and had very limited finances. Being one of the younger children he was indulged, and took advantage of his lack of household chores to spend the majority of his time playing football in the street. However he was arrested by a plain-clothed policeman and sentenced to probation in Children's Court for playing football in the street. He later credited his ball control skills to the many years he spent playing football with large numbers of other children in the tight streets of Cabra. His father and brothers were in the printing trade, and his brother Ollie, a talented footballer, rejected the opportunity to turn professional at Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1950 in order to remain employed in Dublin as a machine minder and play football part-time in the League of Ireland. Three more of his brothers also played in the League of Ireland, and both Ollie and Michael played in the Shelbourne team that won the FAI Cup in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Mulder uses a {{government}} source {{to find a}} secret T3 line in Fairfax County, Virginia, one that the AI uses to access the Internet.

Esther admits that she and David had been planning to transfer their consciousness into cyberspace to enter the AI. Gelman, however, thought the idea was too dangerous. Esther also admits that she and David were in love, and were having an affair behind Gelman's back. Meanwhile, Mulder finds much computer hardware inside the trailer. He also finds David’s dead body, with a virtual reality helmet on his head. Suddenly, Mulder is constrained by moving cables and wires, and experiences a strange vision in which he is in a hospital where nurses threaten to amputate his limbs unless he reveals Kill Switch's location. Meanwhile, the AI locates Scully <b>and</b> <b>Esther</b> driving near a swing bridge. They become trapped on the bridge after the AI manipulates its drawing mechanism, causing Scully to persuade Esther to throw the laptop into the water. Just as it hits the water it is destroyed by the defense satellite's laser strike.|$|E
5|$|Lindsey later {{reveals that}} she is {{pregnant}} with Joe's baby. Joe admits this but tells Mercedes he still {{wants to be with}} her.
