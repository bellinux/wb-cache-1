50|$|One {{approach}} used {{to mitigate the}} problem has been to reduce the boost pressure, which reduces the required venting volume and yields less charge over-calculation by the ECU. The air can also be recirculated back into the intake, a typical stock setup for cars with an upstream MAF sensor. The situation can also be corrected by switching the fuel metering system over to a manifold <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor,</b> a conversion that usually requires a compatible aftermarket ECU or piggy-back fuel controller. The MAP sensor monitors the absolute pressure in the manifold at all times and will correctly detect the change that occurs when the valve vents, allowing the ECU to reduce fuel metering accordingly.|$|E
50|$|Engines {{that use}} a MAP sensor are {{typically}} fuel injected. The manifold <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor</b> provides instantaneous manifold pressure {{information to the}} engine's electronic control unit (ECU). The data {{is used to calculate}} air density and determine the engine's air mass flow rate, which in turn determines the required fuel metering for optimum combustion (see stoichiometry) and influence the advance or retard of ignition timing. A fuel-injected engine may alternatively use a mass airflow sensor (MAF sensor) to detect the intake airflow. A typical naturally aspirated engine configuration employs one or the other, whereas forced induction engines typically use both; a MAF sensor on the intake tract pre-turbo and a MAP sensor on the charge pipe leading to the throttle body.|$|E
5000|$|The Trionic T5.2 uses a Mecel {{patented}} ion-current measurement1 {{to decide}} which cylinder was in the compression phase and had just ignited the air/fuel mixture. The ion-current measurement is thus used to synchronise the ignition's firing of the spark plug with the cylinder which is full of compressed air/fuel. This ion-current measurement can also determine whether there had been detonation or knocking when the cylinder fired. Finally, the ion-current measurement {{can be used to}} identify a misfire with outstanding accuracy. [...] Trionic T5.2 uses a MAP (Manifold <b>Absolute</b> <b>Pressure)</b> <b>sensor</b> to, indirectly, measure the weight of the air that has been drawn/forced into the cylinders. It uses a simple slotted aperture disc in conjunction with a crank position sensor to identify the Top Dead Center (TDC) for cylinders 1 & 4 and also to measure the engine's RPM.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} characterization of an <b>absolute</b> capacitive <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor</b> and integrated inductor that {{form the basis of}} a hydrogel-based implantable wireless glucose sensor. In {{the final version of the}} device, a glucose-sensitive hydrogel will be constrained between the <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor</b> membrane and a rigid, permeable membrane of nanoporous alumina. As glucose diffuses across the rigid membrane, the hydrogel swells, causing the <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor</b> membrane to deflect, altering the resonant frequency of the LC circuit created by the <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor</b> and inductor. Several new analytical equations are presented for designing the <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor,</b> which are demonstrated to be in close agreement with detailed finite element simulations, and a general design methodology for <b>absolute</b> capacitive <b>pressure</b> <b>sensors</b> based around these equations is presented.

40|$|The {{transfer}} {{gas flow}} standard ROMBACH NB 2 was calibrated in the Zagreb Gasworks using two different balances {{incorporated into the}} basic calibration system. The basic difference between these balances was in their resolution, i. e. 1 g for the SARTORIUS IS 64 FG and 0, 1 g for the SARTORIUS LA 64001. Before measurements with the SARTORIUS IS 64 FG balance, <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>sensors</b> HBM P 3 MBA were calibrated using the digital barometer VAISALA PTB 220. The deadweight tester PRESSUREMENTS 6100 - 1 L was employed for HBM P 3 MBA calibration before tests with the SARTORIUS LA 64001 balance. In all tests, experiments were carried out for flow rates from 0, 02 m 3 /s to 1, 4 m 3 /s. Experimental results compare well with experiments previously performed in the Baden-Württemberg Office of Legal Metrology, Germany. The spread of obtained experimental values was within 0, 25 % for the total range of flow rates. The measurement repeatability was within 0, 1 %. The highest contributions to measurement uncertainty result from the air temperature and humidity in the tested gas flow meter and in the container. The measurement uncertainty in tests with the SARTORIUS LA 64001 was smaller than in tests with the SARTORIUS IS 64 FG. Total measurement uncertainty was reduced when <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>sensors</b> HBM P 3 MBA were calibrated using the deadweight tester PRESSUREMENTS 6100 - 1 L compared to results obtained with the VAISALA PTB 220 digital barometer...|$|R

5000|$|The 1981 {{model was}} nearly {{unchanged}} from 1980 {{and would be}} the last model year for the second-generation Camaro. The Z28 was still powered by a 350 CID L V8, however due to new emissions regulations the engine was now equipped with a CCC (Computer Command Control) unit for the first time. This predecessor to modern engine control modules had an oxygen sensor, an electronically controlled carburetor, a throttle position sensor, coolant sensors, a barometric pressure sensor, a Manifold <b>Absolute</b> <b>Pressure</b> <b>sensor</b> (MAP), and a check engine light on the dash. The transmission was now equipped with a lockup torque converter, controlled by the CCC as well. The CCC could also be used as a self-diagnostic tool. However, as the goal of this change was strictly emissions reduction, horsepower dropped to [...] This engine was now only available with an automatic transmission, while the four-speed manual versions had the [...] 305 CID L, which was the only engine offered in Z28s sold in California. Canadian models, however, could still get the 350 and 4-speed combination, and were not equipped with a CCC. Canadian 1981 Camaros were thus identical to 1980 US model. RS models were dropped this year, but the RS designation would reappear in 1989. Total production had dropped down to 126,139 from a high of 282,571 in 1979.|$|E
50|$|The {{most notable}} {{change of the}} RC45 when {{released}} {{was the use of}} Programmed Fuel Injection. Fuel injection had been used on bikes previously but these had either been rather antiquated analog computers or very simple digital units with a minimal number of sensors for input, which resulted in very crude fueling. The RC30 had used 38 mm constant velocity carburettors which, for road use are quite nice, maintaining a high air velocity across a wide rpm range, though were not as well suited for racing. The RC45 did away with carburetors and in their absence a brace of four 46 mm throttles were replaced, Honda now had the throttle area it needed to make big horsepower at high revolutions. The system Honda used on the RC45 was very similar to the system used on the NR750. Contrary to popular belief the RC45’s fuel injection is not like a 4-stage carburetor, rather it is a proper fuel only system. Honda kept the ignition system separate. The Honda system obtained information from the following sensors: crankshaft position sensor, camshaft position sensor, air temperature sensor, coolant temperature sensor, manifold <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor,</b> throttle position sensor, barometric sensor and battery voltage. With all of these sensors relaying information to the ECU, Honda could have quite easily incorporated the ignition control unit. The reason that they had not came down to the supplier of parts: they had different manufacturers supplying the ecu and cdi units. Regardless, it allowed the use of very large throttle plates seamlessly over a very wide engine operating range. The engine of the RC45 also used many magnesium castings, as of rather recently, it has become quite common to see fuel injection and magnesium engine parts on motorcycles, though in the early-to-mid 1990’s this was expensive and incredibly innovative.|$|E
40|$|A {{bio-inspired}} <b>absolute</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor</b> {{network has}} been developed. Absolute pressure sensors, distributed on multiple silicon islands, are connected as a network by stretchable polyimide wires. This sensor network, {{made on a}} 4 ’’ wafer, has 77 nodes and can be mounted on various curved surfaces to cover an area up to 0. 64 m × 0. 64 m, which is 100 times larger than its original size. Due to Micro Electro-Mechanical system (MEMS) surface micromachining technology, ultrathin sensing nodes can be realized with thicknesses of less than 100 µm. Additionally, good linearity and high sensitivity (~ 14 mV/V/bar) have been achieved. Since the MEMS sensor process has also been well integrated with a flexible polymer substrate process, the entire sensor network can be fabricated in a time-efficient and cost-effective manner. Moreover, an accurate pressure contour {{can be obtained from}} the sensor network.

It is an accurate and economical method which is suitable for site efficiency tests. However, it has some limitations.
