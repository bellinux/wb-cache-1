We tested the willingness of an online diabetes community to share data for public health research by providing members with a privacy-preserving social networking software application for rapid temporal-geographic surveillance of glycemic control. SN-mediated collection of cross-sectional, member-reported data from an international online diabetes SN entered into a software application we made available in a "Facebook-like" environment to enable reporting, charting and optional sharing of recent hemoglobin <b>A</b> 1 <b>c</b> values through <b>a</b> geographic display.

40|$|Backgroud: Fine-needle {{aspiration}} cytology (FNAC) is {{a simple}} and reliable technique to assess breast lesions, although a definitive differential diagnosis (benignity vs. cancer) is achieved approximately in 60 - 70 % of cases because <b>an</b> inadequate (<b>C</b> 1), atypical (C 3) or suspicious (C 4) category is otherwise reported. Patients and Methods: A retrospective analysis of 763 cases with C 3 or <b>C</b> 4 <b>reports</b> was performed to define their positive predictive value (PPV), {{as well as the}} practical implications of clinical and imaging findings as for clinical decision-making. FNACs were collected from January 2003 to September 2012 at the Breast Unit of IRCCS "A. O. U. San Martino-IST" Genoa, with each being received later to definitive histology. The PPV for cancer of C 3 /C 4 categories were computed to measure the accuracy of FNAC; moreover, the PPV was also stratified according to clinical, mammography and sono graphy data alone or by their combination. Resuls: The PPV of C 3 and C 4 was 21. 1 % (80 / 380) and 84. 1 % (322 / 383), respectively. Within each C 3 /C 4 category, a significant direct correlation (p< 0. 001) between the suspicion index of clinical, mammography and sonography data and cancer detection rate was always observed. The PPV of C 3 /C 4 stratified by the combination of clinical and imaging findings showed satisfactory values in the C 3 category only when there was an agreement between clinical and imaging findings, whereas the PPV of the C 4 category was always remarkably high (ranging from 92. 3 % to 100 %). Conclusion: the diagnostic work-up in <b>C</b> 4 <b>reports</b> or in patients with <b>a</b> <b>C</b> 3 <b>report</b> but with an high suspicion index at clinical or imaging exami nation should be preferably implemented by means of a core biopsy to optimize the therapeutic planning; given <b>a</b> <b>C</b> 3 <b>report</b> with dubious clinical and/or imaging findings, an excisional biopsy (or in alternative vacuum-assisted breast biopsy with complete removal of the nodule) should be preferably performed in order to reach a definitive histological dia gnosis with no further delay...|$|R

40|$|EYE {{movements}} {{are one of}} the important physiological phenomena which occur when some visual information is obtained. The examination of eye movements may be divided into two broad categories: subjective and objective. In the past observation was mostly subjective, but the recent development of electronic instruments has enabled us to record eye move-ments objectively by electro-oculography (E. O. G.). This procedure has been historically reviewed by Marg (1951), but its clinical application is of comparatively recent date.
