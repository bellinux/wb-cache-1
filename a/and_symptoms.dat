5|$|Common signs <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> of DVT include pain or tenderness, swelling, warmth, redness or discoloration, and distention {{of surface}} veins, {{although}} {{about half of}} those with the condition have no symptoms. Signs <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> alone are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to make a diagnosis, but when considered in conjunction with known risk factors, can help determine the likelihood of DVT. In most suspected cases, DVT is ruled out after evaluation, <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> are more often due to other causes, such as cellulitis, Baker's cyst, musculoskeletal injury, or lymphedema. Other differential diagnoses include hematoma, tumors, venous or arterial aneurysms, and connective tissue disorders.|$|E

40|$|Objective - The aim of {{this study}} was to assess <b>symptom</b> {{frequency}} <b>and</b> <b>symptom</b> distress associated with adverse effects of immunosuppressive therapy in kidney transplant recipients and to correlate it with compliance and socio-demographic characteristics. Methods - <b>Symptom</b> frequency <b>and</b> <b>symptom</b> distress were evaluated by the ‘Adapted Transplant <b>Symptom</b> Frequency <b>and</b> <b>Symptom</b> Distress Scale’. Data were collected from 85 patients who had undergone a kidney transplant between 1995 and 1997. Results - Women reported a significantly higher level of <b>symptom</b> frequency <b>and</b> <b>symptom</b> distress when compared with men. The most frequent symptoms reported by women were changed appearance and increased hair growth, whereas for men were increased appetite and ‘moon face’. Nevertheless the most distressing symptoms for women were painful menstruation and insomnia and for men were impotence and decreased interest in sex. Concerning compliance the non-compliant group reported a higher level of <b>symptom</b> frequency <b>and</b> <b>symptom</b> distress when compared with the compliant group. These results suggest that complications caused by symptoms associated with the adverse effects of immunosuppressive therapy are perceived differently by men and women and may induce non-compliance. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

50|$|In {{a similar}} study, the CD-RISC {{was used to}} examine the {{relationship}} between resilience, unit support, postdeployment social support, PTSD <b>and</b> depressive <b>symptom</b> severity, <b>and</b> psychosocial functioning in a sample of United States military veterans who served during OEF or OIF. The authors hypothesized that resilience would mediate the relationship between unit support and PTSD <b>and</b> depressive <b>symptoms.</b> Additionally, they hypothesized that postdeployment social support would mediate the relationship between PTSD <b>and</b> depressive <b>symptoms</b> <b>and</b> psychosocial functioning. Results supported both hypotheses. Scores on the CD-RISC were negatively associated with scores on measures of PTSD <b>and</b> depressive <b>symptoms.</b> Lower levels of unit support and postdeployment social support were associated with higher levels of PTSD <b>and</b> depressive <b>symptoms</b> <b>and</b> lower levels of resilience and psychosocial functioning. Resilience fully mediated the relationship between unit support and PTSD <b>and</b> depressive <b>symptoms,</b> which confirms the first hypothesis. Finally, postdeployment social support partially mediated the relationship between PTSD <b>and</b> depressive <b>symptoms</b> <b>and</b> psychosocial difficulties, which supports the second hypothesis.|$|R
40|$|Summary. Summary: Little {{is known}} about {{depressive}} <b>and</b> anxious <b>symptoms</b> <b>and</b> quality of life (QOL) in caregivers of children with cystic fibrosis (CF). The aims {{of this study were}} to: (1) assess rates of female and male caregiver depressive <b>and</b> anxious <b>symptoms,</b> <b>and</b> (2) evaluate relations between depressive <b>and</b> anxious <b>symptoms,</b> caregiver QOL, <b>and</b> health outcomes. Patients and Methods: Eligible participants were caregivers of children with CF who completed three questionnaires assessing depressive <b>and</b> anxious <b>symptoms</b> <b>and</b> caregiver QOL during routine CF Clinic appointments. Results: Rates of depressive <b>and</b> anxious <b>symptoms</b> were elevated in female and male caregivers of children with CF. Rates were higher for anxious (51 % for females, 43 % for males) than depressive symptoms (20 – 28 % for females; 14 – 31 % for males). Female caregiver depressive symptoms increased as child lung functioning decreased. As depressive <b>and</b> anxious <b>symptoms</b> increased, caregiver QOL decreased. In addition, female caregiver depressive <b>and</b> anxious <b>symptoms</b> were positively correlated with male caregiver anxious <b>and</b> depressive <b>symptoms</b> in a small subsample of couples. CF disease severity <b>and</b> caregiver depressive <b>symptoms</b> predicted caregiver QOL. Conclusion: Rates of depressive <b>and</b> anxious <b>symptoms</b> are high among caregivers of children with CF. The results of this study highlight the need to screen for female and male caregiver depressive <b>and</b> anxious <b>symptoms</b> in the CF Clinic as CF Team members are well positioned to provided assistance around solving CF-related challenges. In addition, alleviation of depressive <b>and</b> anxious <b>symptoms</b> could potentially lead to improvements in the psychological functioning and well-being of caregivers of children with CF...|$|R

40|$|Associations between perimenstrual {{physical}} <b>and</b> psychological <b>symptoms</b> {{have not}} been adequately studied among adolescent girls. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to test a mediation hypothesis postulating that perimenstrual disengagement from daily activities would mediate the association between physical <b>symptoms</b> <b>and</b> psychological <b>symptoms.</b> A non-clinical sample of N = 208 Italian adolescent girls (age M = 16. 68 years) completed a 95 -item online retrospective questionnaire regarding perimenstrual <b>symptoms,</b> <b>and</b> how these <b>symptoms</b> affect their daily activities. Structural Equation Modeling was used to test the mediation hypothesis. Results showed that physical <b>and</b> psychological <b>symptoms</b> were strongly associated. More importantly, results supported the hypothesis that perimenstrual disengagement from daily activities mediates the association between physical <b>symptoms</b> <b>and</b> psychological <b>symptoms,</b> but only for depressed mood <b>and</b> cognitive <b>symptoms.</b> This study provides support for a novel theoretical framework linking diverse aspects of menstrual cycle change. Longitudinal research is needed to replicate these findings...|$|R

40|$|Background: For two centuries, homoeopathic {{practitioners}} are using personal characteristics, <b>symptoms,</b> <b>and</b> diagnoses/conditions {{to compare the}} “patient picture” with the “medicine picture. ” All data are considered {{within the context of}} the totality, using a so-called heuristic strategy. In prognostic factor research analyzing homoeopathic symptoms, we cannot use this context. Question: What is the essence of a homoeopathic <b>symptom</b> <b>and</b> how do we make assessment of homoeopathic symptoms applicable in daily practice? Methods: A questionnaire with seventy polar symptoms represented in Likert scales was tested in an outpatient clinic in 300 patients. Prevalence of <b>symptoms</b> <b>and</b> correlations between <b>symptoms</b> <b>and</b> between <b>symptoms</b> <b>and</b> conditions were analyzed. Outcome: The prevalence of symptoms varied widely; sometimes, prevalence was too high to give meaningful information. Theoretical considerations about heuristics can explain this variation. There is a considerable correlation between <b>symptoms</b> <b>and</b> between some <b>symptoms</b> <b>and</b> some conditions. Conclusion: The main characteristic of a homoeopathic symptom is its peculiarity, resulting in low prevalence. We can achieve this in research by using more cutoff values in our questionnaire and by guiding the filling in of the questionnaires by well-trained doctors. Correlations between <b>symptoms</b> <b>and</b> between <b>symptoms</b> <b>and</b> conditions should be monitored. Standardization of prognostic factor research is necessary to be able to generalize results...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. Research has {{increasingly}} {{focused on the}} dynamic nature of disability <b>and</b> depressive <b>symptoms</b> in later life. Little research, however, has modeled disability <b>and</b> depressive <b>symptoms</b> as dynamic, related processes. Furthermore, virtually no research has considered social support as dynamic across age. Here, we investigate the relationship between long-term patterns of disability, perceived and received social support, <b>and</b> depressive <b>symptoms</b> in later life. Methods. We use random coefficient (growth) models of four waves of Duke Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly data to determine whether disability, support, <b>and</b> depressive <b>symptoms</b> follow linear trajectories across age and whether support mediates the relationship between disability <b>and</b> depressive <b>symptoms.</b> Results. The results show that (a) trajectories of disability are strongly related to trajectories of depressive <b>symptoms</b> <b>and</b> (b) trajectories of perceived support mediate the relationship between trajectories of disability <b>and</b> depressive <b>symptoms,</b> whereas trajectories of received support do not. Discussion. Disability, social support, <b>and</b> depressive <b>symptoms</b> are strongly interrelated processes in later life. Our {{results are consistent with}} previous research in showing that perceived, rather than received, support mediates the relationship between disability <b>and</b> depressive <b>symptoms,</b> but our results extend previous research in showing that this mediation occurs across time...|$|R

5|$|Signs <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> vary {{depending}} on {{what part of the}} tracheobronchial tree is injured and how severely it is damaged. There are no direct signs of TBI, but certain signs suggest the injury and raise a clinician's suspicion that it has occurred. Many of the signs <b>and</b> <b>symptoms</b> are also present in injuries with similar injury mechanisms such as pneumothorax. Dyspnea and respiratory distress are found in 76–100% of people with TBI, and coughing up blood has been found in up to 25%. However, isolated TBI does not usually cause profuse bleeding; if such bleeding is observed {{it is likely to be}} due to another injury such as a ruptured large blood vessel. The patient may exhibit dysphonia or have diminished breath sounds, and rapid breathing is common. Coughing may be present, and stridor, an abnormal, high-pitched breath sound indicating obstruction of the upper airway can also occur.|$|E
