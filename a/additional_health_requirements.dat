40|$|Overweight {{and obesity}} are {{epidemic}} and worldwide, at all ages, particularly in Westernised societies. Malta {{is no exception}} and indeed, leads this trend. The direct, indirect and long term health risks for the individual and {{population as a whole}} are indisputable. Unless tackled, the current Maltese obesity trends will result in an astronomical increase in morbidity and mortality from ischaemic heart disease, stroke and cancers with an estimated crippling <b>additional</b> <b>health</b> budget <b>requirement</b> of at least Lm 33. 6 million per annum. Obesity is arguably the greatest current national health crisis, and a seriously-funded, all-front national campaign must be implemented with urgency in order to assess and address the crisis at all levels including prevention, lifestyle issues and therapy, with outcome monitoring of national interventions and campaigns. peer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Objective: We {{aim to make}} a {{manpower}} planning forpublic health specialists {{between the}} years 2013 - 2023 in Turkey. Methods: Manpower planning of public health specialists is calculated {{on the basis of}} population and institutional necessities. Data is supplied from the databases of HASUDER, ÖSYM, Turkish MoH, YÖK and the Departments of Public Health’s. Results: There are 520 public health specialists and 286 public health specialization students in Turkey in 2013. Specialization training is supplied at the 57 departments of public health. Nearly half of the public health specialists’ work for Ministry of Health (51 %), while 47 % of public health specialists works for universities. Totally 2014 specialists are required for Turkey in 2013. This number will be increased to 2365 in 2023. In this situation there is one specialist per 145. 000 people in Turkey in 2013, while it had to be one specialist for per 37. 537 people. According to our findings there will be a serious lack of public health specialists in 2018. However if public health specialization students quota is increased to 200 per year, public <b>health</b> specialist <b>requirement</b> will be almost completed in the institutions of Ministry of Health in 2023. Conclusions: However, if <b>additional</b> public <b>health</b> specialist <b>requirements</b> of other ministries, international organizations and municipalities are considered not only specialists, public health graduates in MPH and PhD should also definitely be used for manpower planning.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether certain subgroups of fire fighters {{are prone to}} work-related diminished <b>health</b> <b>requirements.</b> The <b>health</b> <b>requirements</b> for fire-fighting were tested in a workers' health surveillance (WHS) setting. These <b>health</b> <b>requirements</b> included psychological, physical and sense-related components as well as cardiovascular risk factors. The odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) {{for the presence of}} the diminished <b>health</b> <b>requirements</b> were calculated for the subgroups of gender, professionalism and age. The prevalence of diminished psychological requirements was equivalent among the subgroups, and no significant high-risk group was identified. As compared to men fire fighters, women fire fighters {{were more likely to have}} diminished physical requirements (OR 28. 5; 95 % CI 12. 1 - 66. 9) and less likely to have cardiovascular risk factors (OR 0. 3; 0. 1 - 0. 5). As compared to volunteer fire fighters, professionals were less likely to have diminished physical requirements (OR 0. 5; 0. 3 - 0. 9), but professionals had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors with an odds ratio of 1. 9 (1. 1 - 3. 2). As compared to the youngest fire fighters, the oldest fire fighters were more likely to have diminished sense-related requirements (OR 7. 1; 3. 4 - 15. 2); a similar comparison could be made between oldest and middle-aged fire fighters (OR 5. 1; 2. 5 - 10. 5). In addition, the oldest fire fighters were more likely to have cardiovascular risk factors when compared to the youngest (OR 4. 4; 1. 7 - 11. 1) and to the middle-aged fire fighters (OR 3. 1; 1. 2 - 7. 9). Subgroups (gender, professionalism and age) of fire fighters are prone to at least one specific work-related diminished <b>health</b> <b>requirement.</b> Therefore, parts of the WHS could be applied with more attention to these high-risk group...|$|R
