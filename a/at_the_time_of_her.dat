40|$|Objective: To know {{effect of}} hematoma and perihematomal edema volume on Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> {{admission}} {{in patients with}} spontaneous lobar and basal ganglia hemorrhage. Methods: this cross sectional {{study was conducted in}} Neurosurgery department, BSMMU to observe effect of hematoma and perihematomal edema volume on GCS <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> admission in patients with spontaneous lobar and basal ganglia hemorrhage. The duration of study period was from November 2005 to April 2007. Results: a total 48 patients were included in the study and the variables that were analyzed included site of hematoma, volume of hematoma, perihematomal edema and the initial GCS score. Associations between the hematoma and perihematomal edema, site of hemorrhage and perihematomal edema, hematoma volume and GCS <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> admission, perihematomal edema volume and GCS <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> admission were evaluated.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether the circadian rhythm of circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein- 1 (IGFBP- 1) is evident <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> delivery. DESIGN: Prospective observational study in six pregnant women and cross-sectional study in 65 women <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> delivery. SUBJECTS: Six pregnant women sampled {{over a period of}} 24 hours, 23 women sampled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> elective caesarean section, and 42 women sampled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> vaginal delivery. RESULTS: In the women sampled serially over a 24 hour period there was an obvious circadian rhythm of IGFBP- 1 with a peak between 01. 00 and 09. 00 hours. In <b>the</b> women sampled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> delivery there was no evidence for any relationship between <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> delivery and maternal or fetal levels of IGFBP- 1. CONCLUSIONS: The circadian rhythm of IGFBP- 1 is not observed in women in labour. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> day is not an important confounding variable in studies on IGFBP- 1 levels <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> normal delivery...|$|R
