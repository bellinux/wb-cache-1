40|$|This article looks {{upon the}} most recent {{developments}} in the European Union's accession strategies, as from the start <b>of</b> <b>accession</b> negotiations. It first seeks {{to demonstrate that the}} pre-accession conditionality rationale of stabilising present and protecting future integration objectives underpins the so-called 'specific safeguard clauses' of the 2003 and 2005 <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>Accession</b> and the latter's cooperation and verification mechanism, accordingly referred to as post-accession conditionality tools. It then argues that this rationale, emphasised also in the imperative of maintaining the momentum of European integration of the Union's 'integration capacity', above all necessitates effective compliance with EU law, and thus full administrative and judicial capacity of (prospective) Member States. Indeed, the lynchpin of these new conditionality devices evokes putting them in the wider context of compliance mechanisms in the enlarged European Union. It thereby becomes apparent how conditionality has lead to a considerable empowerment of the European Commission which, when reaching into the post-accession phase, entails a problematic differentiation between the Member States. Conditionality methodology furthermore, and this is equally shown, has {{had an impact on the}} Commission's role as 'guardian of the treaty' within the overall system of ensuring compliance with EU law...|$|R
50|$|Although the USSR was {{excluded}} from the honor of being a founding signatory of the Kellogg-Briand Pact on August 27, {{on the same day}} of the treaty's signing an official invitation to accede to the pact was presented to the governments of all other countries {{of the world and the}} Soviet government was quick to add its name to the list of signatories. On August 29 the governing Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of Soviets (TsIK), the nominal head of government, passed a formal resolution to accept the treaty — a result which Litvinov related to peace commission functionaries the following day. An <b>act</b> <b>of</b> formal <b>accession</b> to the Paris treaty was ratified on September 8, 1928.|$|R
50|$|After Augustus {{established}} the Roman Empire, the title imperator was generally {{restricted to the}} emperor, though {{in the early years}} of the empire it would occasionally be granted to a member of his family. As a permanent title, imperator was used as a praenomen by the Roman emperors and was taken on accession. After the reign <b>of</b> Tiberius, the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> being proclaimed imperator was transformed into the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> imperial <b>accession.</b> In fact, if a general was acclaimed by his troops as imperator, it would be tantamount to a declaration of rebellion against the ruling emperor. At first the term continued to be used in the Republican sense as a victory title but attached to the de facto monarch and head of state, rather than the actual military commander. The title followed the emperor's name along with the number of times he was acclaimed as such, for example IMP V ("imperator five times"). In time it became the title of the de facto monarch, pronounced upon (and synonymous with) their assumption.|$|R
5000|$|Jersey {{is neither}} a Member State nor an Associate Member of the European Union. However, {{that is not to}} say that it is outside the European Communities or the European Union in the sense that it is excluded. As Jersey was a European {{territory}} for whose external relations the United Kingdom was responsible, in 1972, it fell within the definition of a Community Territory when the <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Accession</b> was negotiated. The relationship between Jersey and the European Communities was negotiated as a modified extension of the existing relationship with the United Kingdom by Sir Geoffrey Rippon, as he was then. The only European Territories under United Kingdom responsibility which were excluded were the Sovereign Base Territories in Cyprus. Had the Special relationship not been negotiated, then Jersey would have been included within the Communities in the same way as Gibraltar. The Island's relationship with the EC and the EU is governed by article 26(3) of the <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Accession,</b> amending article 227 of the then EEC Treaty, now Article 355(5)(c) TFEU. That article acts together with Protocol 3 to the UK's Treaty of Accession in 1972 which was incorporated into the Treaties, by article 158 of the <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Accession.</b> On Cyprus' Accession, the exclusion of the Cyprus Base Territories was reversed, and the resulting article 355(5)(b) no longer contains the term excluded. For Jersey to be outside the EU and the EC, the term excluded would have had to have been employed.The Treaties therefore apply, but only to the extent necessary to give effect to the arrangements in the Protocol. [...] Protocol 3 and other relevant treaty provisions are made part of Jersey Law by the European Communities (Jersey) Law 1973. Hence the inclusion of provisions of Community law and judgements of the CJEU within the laws of the Island through those provisions, in a similar manner as in the United Kingdom. The relationship between the Channel Islands and the EU cannot be changed without the unanimous agreement of all Member States and Island authorities.|$|E

50|$|Considered {{as one of}} {{the major}} policy success of the first Socialist government, the Spanish entry into the European Economic Community (EEC) took place on January 1, 1986, after a long process of {{negotiations}} that had started in 1979. The integration process had been delayed as a result of several factors, among them the structure of the Spanish economy, which conflicted with European interests (especially in areas such as agriculture and fishing, motivating France to ask for a revision of the Common Agricultural Policy before Spain's accession); but also because the EEC was still undergoing budgetary internal problems resulting from the 1973 oil crisis. These factors hindered and prolonged the negotiations. However, the French position was easened after Felipe González' arrival to government in 1982, having a good relationship with also Socialist French President François Mitterrand. Spain, together with Portugal, signed the <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Accession</b> to the EEC on 12 June 1985 and became officially an EEC member on 1 January 1986, thus ending with a long period of isolation from Europe.|$|E
