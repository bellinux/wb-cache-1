40|$|BACKGROUND: Every year, {{the number}} of HIV/AIDS cases {{increases}} {{twice as much as}} the year before in Turkey. The authors anticipate that the actual numbers of HIV/AIDS cases in Turkey are higher than {{the number of}} cases diagnosed and reported. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This review summarizes the results of some previous studies that were conducted <b>among</b> <b>various</b> <b>risk</b> <b>groups,</b> such as high school and university students, barbers, hair dressers, nurses, pharmacists and doctors, men and women engaged in the sex trade, and security workers in different regions of the country. The responses of participants to similar questions of the studies on the transmission of HIV/AIDS were evaluated in this review. RESULTS: The studies that have been conducted among different risk groups in different regions have shown that in spite of the low prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Turkey, many risk groups still do not have adequate or correct information on the prevalence and transmission of the disease. CONCLUSION: Effective and extensive health education on HIV/AIDS, and the practice of healthy lifestyle would change the epidemiology of the disease in Turkey...|$|E

Methods Eligible individuals were tested with Xpert, smear microscopy, culture and drug-susceptibility testing (DST) at the national TB reference laboratory and three provincial laboratories. Data was collected prospectively from August 2012 to May 2013 from routine laboratory and treat-ment registers. Results A total of 5, 611 Xpert tests were performed mostly targeting contacts of MDR-TB patients, ‘other ’ presumptive MDR-TB patients, and retreatment cases (26 %, 24 % and 22 %, respec-tively). Compared to phenotypic DST, the positive predictive value of Xpert to detect RR-TB was 93. 1 % and 96. 4 % and the negative predictive value was 94. 6 % and 92. 7 % using solid and liquid culture media, respectively. RR-TB detection was highest among (former) prison-ers, retreatment cases, people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), and TB patients with positive smears after intensive phase of treatment (59 %, 58 %, 54 % and 53 % among TB positives, respectively). 88. 9 % of RR-TB patients were registered to have started second-line TB treatment.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{analysis}} was to evaluate the efficacy of alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN) regimens in late chronic phase (diagnosis > 12 months) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CP-CML). Long-term follow-up results were evaluated in 137 patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) -positive late CP-CML. The alpha-IFN programs were sequential studies with human leukocyte alpha-IFN (seven patients), recombinant alpha-IFN alone (15 patients) or with IFN-gamma (29 patients), hydroxyurea (HU) (19 patients), or low-dose cytarabine (Ara-C) (67 patients). Overall, 57 % of the patients achieved complete hematological response (CHR), and 7 % obtained partial hematological response. Nineteen patients (15 % of the 123 evaluable patients) had a cytogenetic response which was major (Ph-positive < 35 %) in 10 patients (8 %). A trend for better responses was observed with shorter disease duration. The median overall survival from start of therapy was 49 months, with an estimated 5 -year survival rate of 41 %. Some common pretreatment prognostic factors associated with response did not show statistical associations when applied in late CP-CML; however, characteristics such as smaller spleen size, and lower percentages of peripheral blood and marrow blasts and basophils were associated with better survival experience. When patients were subgrouped according to risk, {{no significant differences in}} the incidence of cytogenetic response and in survival outcomes were observed <b>among</b> <b>various</b> <b>risk</b> <b>groups.</b> This study confirms that alpha-IFN-based regimens have a modest activity in late CP-CML, and supports the need to develop investigational strategies aimed at improving patient prognosis in this phase...|$|E
40|$|To {{gain insight}} into the spread of {{hepatitis}} B <b>among</b> <b>various</b> <b>risk</b> <b>groups</b> in Amsterdam a 6 -year (1992 - 1997) retrospective DNA sequencing study was carried out on isolates from stored sera from reported primary cases of acute hepatitis B infection. Cases were classified according to risk behavior, as determined in interviews. Of the available serum, a selected region of hepatitis B-virus-DNA was amplified and sequenced. The nucleotide alignments were subjected to phylogenetic tree analysis. When nucleotide alignments were subjected to phylogenetic analysis, the strains of 54 isolates, 26 % of the 204 reported primary cases, clustered in five genotypes: A, C, D, E, and F. In genotype A, a cluster related to men having sex with men was identified. In genotype D, two subclusters could be identified: one was related to injecting drug use and another {{was related to the}} Moroccan population in Amsterdam. The remaining strains showed a high genetic variability within three different genotypes: F, E, and C. Of the 14 identical isolates in the "homosexual men cluster," one was isolated from a female heterosexual. Of the 14 identical strains in the "drug users strain," six were from non-drug using heterosexual active individuals. In the cluster of twelve isolates related to hepatitis B-endemic areas, probable modes of transmission were varied. Sequence analysis provides important insight into the spread of hepatitis B among various high-risk groups. The analysis indicates that the prevention strategy in The Netherlands fails to stop transmission of hepatitis B from persistently infected individuals originating from hepatitis B endemic countrie...|$|E

40|$|Background: Previous {{studies on}} the {{molecular}} epidemiology of hepatitis A virus (HAV) in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, show that subgenotype 1 A is mainly seen among homosexual men practising anonymous oral-anal sex in saunas and darkrooms, while subgenotype I B is usually detected among children originating from Morocco, and subgenotype 3 A is mostly found among travellers to Pakistan. Objective: We studied the genotype distribution in a more rural area of The Netherlands, Noord-Brabant, and compared it with Amsterdam. Study design: We collected blood and feces samples from 34 HAV IgM(+) individuals who were reported from August 2001 -March 2003 at the Municipal Health Service (MHS) Heart for Brabant (Brabant). We also collected feces samples from nine household contacts of whom the HAV IgM status was not known. HAV RNA was isolated and subsequently amplified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the VP 1 -P 2 a and the VP 3 -VP 1 region, sequenced and analysed. Results and conclusions: In most cases, relations between risk groups and HAV subgenotypes in Noord-Brabant {{were similar to those}} in Amsterdam. Next to genotypes I and 3 we also detected a genotype 2 / 7 strain in a Noord-Brabant case. Also, in contrast to the Amsterdam study, sporadic transmission occurred <b>among</b> <b>various</b> <b>risk</b> <b>groups.</b> Children involved in a school-related outbreak were infected with strains identical to one that was previously isolated from a man who has sex with men (MSM). Also, Dutch patients having no epidemiological link with Turkish or Moroccan children harboured strains imported from high-endemic countries. Furthermore, we report a special case in which HAV may be causally involved in meningitis. The results of this study show that the molecular epidemiology of HAV in The Netherlands can be more complicated than previously anticipated and that HAV phylogenetic studies can provide important information for the design of appropriate public health measures.

40|$|In this paper, we analyze risk coping {{behavior}} of Cambodian firms during {{the global financial}} crisis. <b>Among</b> <b>various</b> <b>risk</b> coping strategies, we specifically analyze input smoothing (labor, raw materials, or capital). If it is costly to adjust inputs, firms will prefer to smooth the path of adjusting their inputs in response to fluctuating demand, especially when demand shocks {{are expected to be}} temporary. However, their capacity for such smoothing may be more limited for credit constrained firms, creating a potential welfare loss due to incomplete smoothing. Using panel data of Cambodian firms {{at the time of the}} 2008 global economic crisis, we show that (1) firms try to smooth inputs especially when they believe the shock to be temporary, (2) non-credit constrained firms are better able to smooth inputs than credit constrained firms, and (3) the welfare loss from incomplete smoothing due to credit constraints is an order of magnitude larger than the adjustment costs of the firms that were not credit constrained. The paper concludes with a discussion of the policy implications of the findings...|$|R
40|$|Health {{insurers}} {{are generally}} {{guided by the}} principle of 2 ̆ 2 actuarial fairness, 2 ̆ 2 according to which they distinguish <b>among</b> <b>various</b> <b>risks</b> {{on the basis of}} costrelated factors. Thus, insurers often limit or deny coverage for vision care, hearing aids, mental health care, and even AIDS treatment based on actuarial justifications. Furthermore, approximately forty-two million Americans have no health insurance at all, because most of these individuals cannot afford the cost of insurance. This Article argues that Americans have come to demand more than actuarial fairness from health insurers and are increasingly concerned about what I call 2 ̆ 2 moral fairness. 2 ̆ 2 This is evidenced by the hundreds of laws that have been passed to constrain insurers 2 ̆ 7 discretion with respect to particular coverage decisions. Legislative mandates are frequent, but seemingly haphazard, following no systematic methodology. This Article suggests an analytical framework that can be utilized to determine which interventions are appropriate and evaluates a variety of means by which moral fairness could be promoted in the arena of health care coverage...|$|R
40|$|Purpose The main {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate risk-based protective and interactive protective factors for violence. Methods The youngest sample of the Pittsburgh Youth Study, a prospective longitudinal survey of 503 boys followed-up from age 7 onwards, was analyzed. Variables measured at age 10 – 12 were investigated as predictors of an all-source measure of violence between ages 13 and 19. Results A number of individual (e. g., low hyperactivity, low psychopathic features) family (good supervision, low parental stress), school (high academic achievement, positive attitude to school) and demographic characteristics (older mother, good quality housing) were found to be risk-based protective factors for the <b>various</b> <b>risk</b> <b>groups</b> identified. High academic achievement was consistently found to be an interactive protective factor and was consistently independently related to low levels of violence. Conclusions Much more research on risk-based protective factors and interactive protective factors is needed so that these can be integrated into developmental and life-course explanations of offending. Also, interventions should be tailored to include knowledge about these protective factors in light of the specific risks that individuals possess...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we have {{investigated}} {{the diversity of the}} current HIV- 1 strains circulating in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; in addition, we have evaluated the applicability of peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA) for HIV- 1 subtyping. Previous studies have indicated that HIV- 1 subtype C is the major subtype present in HIV-positive samples collected from <b>various</b> <b>risk</b> <b>groups</b> between 1988 and 1995 in Addis Ababa. To assess the possible influx of new HIV- 1 subtypes, 150 commercial sex workers (CSW) reporting in 1997 to two Health Centers in Addis Ababa were enrolled in an unlinked anonymous cross-sectional study. Subtyping was performed according to the World Health Organization algorithm of peptide ELISA, followed by HMA and DNA sequencing. As a result, the HIV- 1 prevalence among these CSWs was found to be 45 % (67 of 150). Of the 67 samples, 66 contained HIV- 1 of subtype C and only one was of subtype D. This confirms the persistent overall presence of HIV- 1 subtype C in Addis Ababa and a low influx of other subtypes into this locatio...|$|R
40|$|Preterm {{delivery}} (PTD) is {{the leading}} cause of infant morbidity and mortality in the United States. An epidemiological association between PTD and various bacteria that are part of the vaginal microflora has been reported. No single bacterial species has been identified as being causally associated with PTD, suggesting a multifactorial etiology. Quantitative microbiologic cultures have been used previously to define normal vaginal microflora in a predictive model. These techniques have been applied to vaginal swab cultures from pregnant women in an effort to develop predictive microbiologic models for PTD. Logistic regression analysis with microbiologic information was performed for <b>various</b> <b>risk</b> <b>groups,</b> and the probability of a PTD was calculated for each subject. Four predictive models were generated by using the quantitative microbiologic data. The area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operating curves ranged from 0. 74 to 0. 94, with confidence intervals (CI) ranging from 0. 62 to 1. The model for the previous PTD <b>risk</b> <b>group</b> with the highest percentage of PTDs had an AUC of 0. 91 (CI, 0. 79 to 1). It may be possible to predict PTD by using microbiologic risk factors measured once the gestation period has reached the 20 -week time point...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the impact that state and federal accountability systems have had on instructional practice in two large Texas school districts by comparing the performance of students at these schools on individual items from the 2011 Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) and relating performance to item difficulty and the schools 2 ̆ 7 accountability risk as determined by prior accountability performance. To make this comparison, schools were placed into accountability <b>risk</b> <b>groups</b> based on past performance on the No Child Left Behind Act 2 ̆ 7 s (NCLB) Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) accountability instrument. The researcher then calculated the mean differences between average performance on each item and compared them against the item difficulty score {{to determine if the}} relationship was significant. The relationship was tested for all groups, both isolating and excluding economically disadvantaged students and those with limited English proficiency. Inclusion in these groups was based on the coding the students were assigned in the state 2 ̆ 7 s assessment data file. This comparison used a simple regression analysis performed on SPSS statistical software, version 20. ^ The findings of the study revealed a statistically significant positive relationship between the gap in performance for each <b>risk</b> <b>group</b> and the item difficulty level, meaning that as item difficulty increased the gap between students in the <b>various</b> <b>risk</b> <b>groups</b> grew larger as well. Based on this study, the researcher questions how effective the federal accountability system is at determining school achievement. ...|$|R
