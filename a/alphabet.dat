5|$|How the <b>Alphabet</b> Was Made — Taffimai and {{her father}} invent an <b>alphabet.</b>|$|E
5|$|In public statements, Young {{claimed the}} <b>alphabet</b> was {{intended}} to replace the traditional Latin <b>alphabet</b> with an alternative, more phonetically accurate <b>alphabet</b> for the English language. This would offer immigrants {{an opportunity to learn}} to read and write English, he said, the orthography of which is often less phonetically consistent than those of many other languages. Similar experiments have not been uncommon, the most well-known of which is the Shavian <b>alphabet.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sogdian {{was written}} largely in three scripts: the Sogdian <b>alphabet,</b> the Syriac <b>alphabet,</b> and the Manichaean <b>alphabet,</b> each {{derived from the}} Aramaic <b>alphabet,</b> which had been widely used in both the Achaemenid and Parthian empires of ancient Persia. The Sogdian <b>alphabet</b> {{formed the basis of}} the Old Uyghur <b>alphabet</b> of the 8th century, which in turn was used to create the Mongolian script of the early Mongol Empire during the 13th century.|$|E

5|$|The Hebrew <b>alphabet</b> is, {{like the}} Persian <b>alphabet,</b> an abjad. It {{is used for}} the Jewish Bukhori dialect {{primarily}} in Samarkand and Bukhara. Additionally, since 1940, when Jewish schools were closed in Central Asia, the use of the Hebrew <b>Alphabet</b> outside Hebrew liturgy fell into disuse and Bukharian Jewish publications such as books and newspapers began to appear using the Tajik Cyrillic <b>Alphabet.</b> Today, many older Bukharian Jews who speak Bukharian and went to Tajik or Russian schools in Central Asia only know the Tajik Cyrillic <b>Alphabet</b> when reading and writing Bukharian and Tajik.|$|E
5|$|The Sinhalese <b>alphabet</b> (Sinhalese: සිංහල අක්ෂර මාලාව) (Siṁhala Akṣara Mālāva) is an <b>alphabet</b> {{used by the}} Sinhalese {{people in}} Sri Lanka and {{elsewhere}} to write the Sinhalese language and also the liturgical languages Pali and Sanskrit. The Sinhalese <b>alphabet,</b> {{which is one of}} the Brahmic scripts, a descendant of the ancient Indian Brahmi script closely related to the South Indian Grantha script and Kadamba <b>alphabet.</b>|$|E

25|$|Fingerspelling (or dactylology) is the {{representation}} of the letters of a writing system, and sometimes numeral systems, using only the hands. These manual <b>alphabets</b> (also known as finger <b>alphabets</b> or hand <b>alphabets),</b> have often been used in deaf education, and have subsequently been adopted as a distinct part of a number of sign languages; there are about forty manual <b>alphabets</b> around the world. Historically, manual <b>alphabets</b> have had a number of additional applications—including use as ciphers, as mnemonics, and in silent religious settings.|$|R
50|$|Sinhalese Braille {{is one of}} {{the many}} Bharati braille <b>alphabets.</b> While it largely {{conforms}} to the letter values of other Bharati <b>alphabets,</b> it diverges in the values of the letters assigned toward the end of those <b>alphabets.</b>|$|R

5|$|According to Beesley, {{many have}} written that {{interest}} in the Deseret <b>alphabet</b> died with Brigham Young. This, however, isn't true; the <b>alphabet</b> was already regarded as a failure during Young's time. Only 500 copies of the full Book of Mormon translated into the Deseret <b>alphabet</b> sold for US$2 each, and even Young realized that the venture was too expensive {{and even the most}} devout Mormons could not be convinced to purchase and study the Deseret edition books over the books in the traditional orthography. In the winter of 1870, just one year after their publication, advertisements for the Deseret <b>alphabet</b> books were quietly removed from the Deseret News.|$|E
5|$|Although Gjirokastriti's {{edition of}} the New Testament was written in Albanian, it used the Greek <b>alphabet.</b> It is not known which <b>alphabet</b> Meksi used in his own manuscript.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{regards the}} main influences {{at play in}} the Georgian <b>alphabet,</b> as scholars have debated whether it was inspired more by the Greek <b>alphabet,</b> or by Semitic alphabets such as Aramaic. Recent historiography focuses on greater similarities with the Greek <b>alphabet</b> than in the other Caucasian writing systems, most notably the order and numeric value of letters. Some scholars have also suggested certain pre-Christian Georgian cultural symbols or clan markers as a possible inspiration for particular letters.|$|E
50|$|The chart {{shows the}} {{graphical}} evolution of Phoenician letter forms into other <b>alphabets.</b> The sound values often changed significantly, both {{during the initial}} creation of new <b>alphabets,</b> and due to pronunciation changes of languages using the <b>alphabets</b> over time.|$|R
25|$|The Turkic <b>alphabets</b> are sets {{of related}} <b>alphabets</b> with letters (formerly known as runes), used for writing mostly Turkic languages. Inscriptions in Turkic <b>alphabets</b> {{were found in}} Mongolia. Most of the {{preserved}} inscriptions were dated to between 8th and 10th centuries CE.|$|R

5|$|At {{least four}} books were {{published}} in the new <b>alphabet,</b> all transcribed by Orson Pratt and all using the Russell's House font: The First Deseret <b>Alphabet</b> Reader (1868), The Second Deseret <b>Alphabet</b> Reader (1868), The Book of Mormon (1869), and a Book of Mormon excerpt called First Nephi–Omni (1869).|$|E
5|$|Biblical Hebrew {{has been}} written {{with a number of}} {{different}} writing systems. The Hebrews adopted the Phoenician <b>alphabet</b> around the 12th centuryBCE, which developed into the Paleo-Hebrew <b>alphabet.</b> This was retained by the Samaritans, who use the descendent Samaritan <b>alphabet</b> to this day. However, the Aramaic <b>alphabet</b> gradually displaced the Paleo-Hebrew <b>alphabet</b> for the Jews, and it became the source for the modern Hebrew <b>alphabet.</b> All of these scripts were lacking letters to represent all of the sounds of Biblical Hebrew, though these sounds are reflected in Greek and Latin transcriptions/translations of the time. These scripts originally only indicated consonants, but certain letters, known by the Latin term matres lectionis, became increasingly used to mark vowels. In the Middle Ages, various systems of diacritics were developed to mark the vowels in Hebrew manuscripts; of these, only the Tiberian vocalization is still in wide use.|$|E
5|$|Bilinguals {{using two}} {{different}} alphabets should demonstrate a name-letter effect in both alphabets. A weaker effect should {{be found in}} the second <b>alphabet,</b> as names in second alphabets are likely to be less connected to the self. Hoorens and Todorova found that bilinguals with a tendency to like their name letters in Cyrillic also had a tendency to like their name letters in the Roman <b>alphabet.</b> The effect was found to be weaker in the second <b>alphabet.</b> This was replicated in a Thai-English study by Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun.|$|E

5|$|His new <b>alphabet</b> closely resembled an 1853 {{publication}} of Isaac Pitman, containing only 33 letters. However, at this point, Young was still enamored {{with the original}} Deseret <b>alphabet,</b> and so he rejected the proposal and Watt continued to publicly promote the <b>alphabet</b> {{as part of his}} job despite his reservations.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the ninth}} century, English {{has been written}} in a Latin <b>alphabet</b> (also called Roman <b>alphabet).</b> Earlier Old English texts in Anglo-Saxon runes are only short inscriptions. The great {{majority}} of literary works in Old English that survive to today are written in the Roman <b>alphabet.</b> The modern English <b>alphabet</b> contains 26 letters of the Latin script: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z (which also have capital forms: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).|$|E
5|$|The Bronze Age (3200–1200 BCE) saw {{the birth}} of Lebanon's first {{fortified}} villages, the development of commercial and maritime activities and {{the invention of the}} world's first <b>alphabet</b> in Byblos.

5|$|The Deseret <b>alphabet</b> was {{purposely}} {{designed so}} as to not have ascenders and descenders. This was envisioned as a practical benefit for the <b>alphabet</b> {{in an era of}} metal type: after many uses, the edges of type sorts become dull, and narrow ascenders and descenders are most prone to this effect.|$|E
