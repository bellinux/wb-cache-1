There were also some lyrics alluding to former N.W.A rapper Ice Cube, who departed acrimoniously from the group in 1989 and ridiculed Dre on the track [...] "No Vaseline", off his 1991 Death Certificate album. The lyrics: [...] "Then <b>we</b> <b>gon</b> creep to South Central, On a Street Knowledge mission, as I steps in the temple, Spot him, got him, as I pulls out my strap, Got my chrome to the side of his White Sox hat, You tryin to check my homey, you best check yo self, Cause when you diss Dre you diss yourself" [...] had references to Cube's production operation Street Knowledge Productions (now Lench Mob Records), the lyrics [...] "steps in the temple" [...] referring to Ice Cube's affiliation with the Nation of Islam and his hit single [...] "Check Yo Self" [...] from third album The Predator. However, by the album's release, Ice Cube was on friendlier terms with Dr. Dre, even having a cameo appearance in [...] "Let Me Ride", so unlike Eazy-E and Luke, he was not parodied in the music video.|$|R

Deletion of genes coding for the KEOPS subunits also affects telomere elongation and transcriptional regulation. In the present work, the crystal structure of Bud 32 /Cgi 121 in complex with ADP revealed that ADP is bound in the catalytic site of Bud 32 in a canonical manner characteristic of Protein Kinase A (PKA) family proteins. <b>We</b> found that <b>Gon</b> 7 forms a stable heterodimer with Pcc 1 and report the crystal structure of the Pcc 1 -Gon 7 heterodimer. Gon 7 interacts with the same Pcc 1 region engaged in the archaeal Pcc 1 homodimer. We further show that yeast KEOPS, unlike its archaeal counterpart, exists as a heteropentamer in which Gon 7, Pcc 1, Kae 1, Bud 32 and Cgi 121 also adopt a linear arrangement. We constructed a model of yeast KEOPS that provides structural insight into the role of Gon 7.
