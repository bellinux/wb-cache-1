Alderman Hodkin laid the foundation stone on 27 October 1920; as work commenced the Alderman demonstrated the authority's concerns, telling the local newspaper that: [...] "we can build houses, but we cannot build homes.

By 1936, most of the social housing available as of 2012 was in existence and provides accommodation to over half {{of the population of the}} suburb.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fundamental}} {{theme of}} the Book of Daniel is God's control over history. According to Deuteronomy 32:8-9 God assigned each nation its own divine patron; originally these were subordinate gods, {{but by the time}} Daniel came to be written they had been redefined as angels. In Daniel, Michael, the angel of Israel, is in battle with the [...] "prince (i.e., angelic patron) of Persia", <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> followed by further battle with the [...] "prince of Greece"–the theological point being made is that the fate of nations is decided in heaven, not on earth.

2500|$|While viral vectors are 40% more {{efficient}} in transferring genes, {{they are not}} fully appreciated for in vivo gene delivery because of their further adverse effects. Primarily, viral vectors induce an inflammatory response, which can cause minor side effects such as mild edema or serious ones like multisystem organ failure. It is also difficult to administer gene therapy repeatedly due to the immune system's enhanced response to viruses. Furthermore, viruses may spread out to other organs after intraarticular injection <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> an important disadvantage. [...] However, majority of problems associated with gene delivery using viral vectors solved by ex vivo gene delivery method.

2500|$|A public {{footpath}} between Gains Lane and Cadman's Lane {{crosses the}} route, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> partially re-routed along the towpath. A farm track then crosses a culvert, {{both of which}} will be altered to allow the culvert to pass under the canal without using an inverted syphon. A public footpath called Cadman's Lane will be diverted to cross the canal at the next lock. Three locks follow, called Dark Lane, Pylon and Cadman's. Pylon Lock is so named because it is located close to a large electricity pylon. At Cadman's Lock a farm track will be routed over the tail of the lock, and an adjacent ditch will be routed under the canal at the top end of the lock, to maintain the water levels. The canal then crosses Cadman's Lane again, which will be diverted for some distance along the towpath, mitigating the problems caused {{by the fact that the}} lane is often flooded by the Wash Brook, and becomes impassable. Wash Brook Lock will include a bridge over its tail to allow Cadman's Lane to rejoin its original route. Beyond the lock, the canal will be built on an embankment, some [...] high in places.|$|E
