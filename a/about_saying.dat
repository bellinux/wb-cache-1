25|$|Recently, {{aesthetic}} and literary modes of interpretation have developed, which focus on Revelation {{as a work}} of art and imagination, viewing the imagery as symbolic depictions of timeless truths and the victory of good over evil. Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza wrote Revelation: Vision of a Just World from the viewpoint of rhetoric. Accordingly, Revelation's meaning is partially determined by the way John goes <b>about</b> <b>saying</b> things, partially by the context in which readers receive the message and partially by its appeal to something beyond logic.|$|E
25|$|During his civil {{engineering}} days, Cauchy {{once had been}} briefly in charge of repairing {{a few of the}} Parisian sewers, and he made the mistake of mentioning this to his pupil; with great malice, the young Duke went <b>about</b> <b>saying</b> Mister Cauchy started his career in the sewers of Paris. His role as tutor lasted until the Duke became eighteen years old, in September 1838. Cauchy did hardly any research during those five years, while the Duke acquired a lifelong dislike of mathematics. The only good that came out of this episode was Cauchy's promotion to Baron, a title by which Cauchy set great store. In 1834, his wife and two daughters moved to Prague, and Cauchy was finally reunited with his family after four years in exile.|$|E

On June 27, 2011, [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] was the twelfth song to be made available. In the accompanying quote, Beyoncé said: [...] "I try to write songs that will {{bring out the best}} in all of us and keep us close together.

500|$|In the beginning, Margaret Weis had {{problems}} depicting Tanis Half-Elven in the novels. Tracy Hickman finally told her [...] "He's James T. Kirk of the Starship Enterprise." [...] After that explanation, Margaret {{had no more}} difficulty writing about Tanis. Other noteworthy antagonists, and sometimes protagonists, are the Death Knight Lord Soth and Kitiara Uth Matar, the half-sister of Raistlin and Caramon, and leader {{of one of the}} Dragonarmies of Ansalon. According to Hickman, Lord Soth is the most unpredictable character to write <b>about,</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "Every time that character made an appearance in one of our books he would try to run off with the story." ...|$|E

500|$|For the 1997 American {{television}} showing, {{the film}} was broadcast virtually unedited. The telecast {{was the first to}} receive a TV-M (now TV-MA) rating under the TV Parental Guidelines that had been established earlier that year. Tom Coburn, then an Oklahoma congressman, said that in airing the film, NBC had brought television [...] "to an all-time low, with full-frontal nudity, violence and profanity", adding that it was an insult to [...] "decent-minded individuals everywhere". Under fire from both Republicans and Democrats, Coburn apologized, saying, [...] "My intentions were good, but I've obviously made an error in judgment in how I've gone <b>about</b> <b>saying</b> what I wanted to say." [...] He clarified his opinion, stating that the film ought to have been aired later at night when there would not be [...] "large numbers of children watching without parental supervision".|$|E
500|$|With Election Special, Cooder {{wanted to}} write an album with direct lyrics and {{encourage}} urgency in listeners during the US presidential election of 2012. He felt that the election season was [...] "the time of decision in this country... the most critical {{time in the history}} of the country". When asked about concerns over [...] "", Cooder said in an interview for the Los Angeles Times, [...] "I thought I should have a record that says, 'This here record is for you during election time.' Rather than be vague and poetic, let's just call this what it is. That way I may get people's attention. That's the idea." [...] Cooder drew on music he grew up listening to such as Depression-era songs and sought to appropriate contemporary subject matter to them. When writing the album, he also touched on the Occupy movement, which he felt optimistic <b>about,</b> <b>saying</b> that [...] "There's a sign of something. Those people are having conversations, and the conversations become issues and the issues become talked about. Pretty soon, the rest of the world picks up on it, even the politicians." ...|$|E
500|$|Robinson's {{election}} and consecration prompted {{a group of}} 19 bishops, led by Robert Duncan, Bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, {{to make a statement}} warning the church of a possible schism between the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Communion. Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, stated that [...] " [...] will inevitably {{have a significant impact on}} the Anglican Communion throughout the world and it is too early to say what the result of that will be." [...] He added: [...] "t is my hope that the church in America and the rest of the Anglican Communion will have the opportunity to consider this development before significant and irrevocable decisions are made in response." [...] Desmond Tutu, Archbishop emeritus of Cape Town, stated that he did not see what [...] "all the fuss" [...] was <b>about,</b> <b>saying</b> the election would not roil the Church of the Province of Southern Africa. Other senior bishops of the church, like Peter Akinola, Archbishop of the Church of Nigeria and head of the Global South, have made Robinson a figurehead in their dispute with the Episcopal Church. Some disaffected Episcopalians have disaffiliated from the Episcopal Church and formed the Convocation of Anglicans in North America with the support of the Nigerian church.|$|E

500|$|... "Once More, with Feeling" [...] {{propelled}} {{the story}} arc for season six by allowing characters to confess previously taboo issues {{to themselves and}} each other. Whedon commented that he was [...] "obsessive about progressing a plot in a song, <b>about</b> <b>saying</b> things we haven't said", comparing the musical theater format to the fourth-season episode [...] "Hush", in which characters begin communicating when they stop talking. According to Buffy essayist Zoe-Jane Playdon, earlier episodes' [...] "false saccharine behaviour" [...] impedes the characters so crucially that it summons a demon {{to force them to}} be honest. The consequences in the episode of concealing truth, spontaneous combustion, is an allusion to Bleak House by Charles Dickens—of whom Whedon is a fan—where characters also face immolation for being deceitful. For Buffy, however, truth is slow in coming, as she continues to lie to the Scoobies, claiming to forget what she sang about in the graveyard during [...] "Going Through the Motions". Buffy continues her charade in the chorus number [...] "If We're Together", beginning the song by persuading others to join in one by one, as if each is convinced that she is still invested and in charge, and their strength as a group is infallible. Although she asks in verse [...] "Apocalypse / We've all been there / The same old trips / Why should we care?", all the Scoobies join her, including Giles despite his suspicions that Buffy is no longer interested in her life.|$|E
500|$|In May 2010, when MTV News first {{announced}} that Ellis had finished writing Imperial Bedrooms, the writer told them in {{interview that he}} had begun looking ahead {{to the possibility of}} a film adaptation, and felt that interpreting it as a sequel to the 1987 movie adaptation starring Andrew McCarthy, Robert Downey Jr., James Spader and Jami Gertz [...] "would be a great idea". Two months prior to the book's release, Less Than Zero actor Andrew McCarthy stated it was [...] "early days" [...] in thinking about a potential film adaptation; McCarthy felt, however, that the novel would adapt well. Because the characters in Imperial Bedrooms have been owned by 20th Century Fox since Ellis sold the film rights to Less Than Zero, prospective film for Imperial Bedrooms rights revert to Fox. Ellis stated to Vice in June 2010 that he would be interested in writing the screenplay. In July 2010 however, the author clarified to California Chronicle, saying [...] "There's no deal, there's no one attached. There's been some vague talk among the cast members... As far as I know right now nothing's happening." [...] Ellis opines that were Robert Downey Jr. to get involved, the film would move straight into production. However, remembering the adaptation process Less Than Zero went through, he admits [...] "I've learned to be cautious <b>about</b> <b>saying</b> oh they'll never turn this dark depraved character into any sort of interesting Mulholland Drive, David Lynch kind of movie, but I could be totally wrong about that. I don't know." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike Madonna's {{previous}} two lead singles, [...] "4 Minutes" [...] (2008) and [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'" [...] (2012), [...] "Living for Love" [...] puts {{the emphasis on}} the lyrics and vocals, with the lines on the bridge going like [...] "Took me to heaven, let me fall down/Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on" [...] and a [...] "throbbing drop" [...] in the middle. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine described the song as Kiesza meets [...] "Like a Prayer", and noted that there were many changes from the leaked demo version: the throwback house music being replaced by an 808 pulse sound and Keys' piano, as well as handclaps and gospel riffing being removed {{towards the end of the}} song. For Jon Lisi from PopMatters, [...] "Living for Love" [...] fitted with contemporary pop music releases and the DIY ethic they displayed, starting from Taylor Swift's [...] "Shake It Off", to Ariana Grande's [...] "Break Free" [...] and Katy Perry's [...] "Roar". The survivor anthem-like nature of the track was evocative of Madonna's survival in her music career. With NRJ the singer herself explained the meaning behind the lyrics: [...] "It's a song having your heart broken but it's <b>about</b> <b>saying</b> you know what I'm going to my life goes on, I will carry on, I won't stop believing in love, I'll pick up my crown, put it back on my head and I will walk through life proudly believing that love, true love does exist." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{one time}} Wren was {{credited}} with {{the design of the}} King's House at Newmarket, Suffolk. The attribution gave rise to an apocryphal story in which Charles II, who was over six feet tall, complained about the low ceilings. Wren, who was not so tall, replied that [...] "They were high enough!", at which the king crouched down until he was on a level with his Surveyor and strutted <b>about</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "Ay, Ay, Sir Christopher, I think they are high enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|The fourteenth track, [...] "Faith" [...] {{is about}} having faith in your self. The main sample {{in the song}} is an Etta James song, this ties in {{that one of the}} major reasons the album was pushed back so much was due to sample {{clearance}} issues. Papoose called his collaboration with DJ Premier, [...] "Turn it Up", [...] "hip hop in its truest form", and his most important collaboration on the album. Premier does the intro to the song and handled the production. The song [...] "Get At Me" [...] which features and was produced by Ron Browz is <b>about</b> <b>saying</b> something to someone's face, rather than speaking behind their back about them.|$|E
2500|$|This {{statement}} {{met with}} strong criticism, {{as the film}} deals mainly with the Holocaust. After heavy criticism, Coburn apologized [...] "to all those I have offended" [...] and clarified that he agreed with the movie being aired on television, but stated {{that it should have}} been on later in the evening. In apologizing, Coburn said that at that time of the evening there are still large numbers of children watching without parental supervision and stated that he stood by his message of protecting children from violence, but had expressed it poorly. He also said, [...] "My intentions were good, but I've obviously made an error in judgment in how I've gone <b>about</b> <b>saying</b> what I wanted to say." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the {{publication}} of the first volume, Rossiter was asked to run the NSF's program on the History and Philosophy of Science while its director took a year of leave during 1982–1983. In 1983–1984 she was a visiting professor at Harvard, where she continued work on her second volume. Still unable to find a tenure-track position, she applied for the NSF's Visiting Professorships for Women program, and received a one-year appointment to Cornell, which she stretched to two years (1986–1988). Cornell agreed to keep her on for another three years, but her funding was split between three departments including women's studies, agriculture, and history. In many ways, at this stage of her career she felt like some of the women she wrote <b>about,</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "I guess I am like a 78 [...] record in a 33 world".|$|E
2500|$|Ben's dives at {{the site}} were regular enough that the dive shop {{employees}} and other frequent visitors came to know him. One of the employees, Chuck Cronin, believed that while Ben had the proper equipment and considerable diving knowledge, he was often overly confident in his abilities and not shy <b>about</b> <b>saying</b> so. That opinion, the Memphis Commercial Appeal later reported, was shared by posters on a scuba diving website, scubaboard.com, who had also met Ben during trips to Vortex Spring. (According to a 2014 online comment by his father, {{he could not find}} anyone at Vortex Spring willing to be his diving partner, so he did his dives alone.) His parents later defended him from those criticisms by seeing them as positive traits. [...] "Ben was brave," [...] his father later said. [...] "Ben was fearless. He followed his passions." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 14 April, in the Commons, Powell claimed [...] "it is {{difficult}} to fault the military and especially the naval measures which the Government have taken". He added: [...] "We are in some danger of resting our position too exclusively upon the existence, the nature and {{the wishes of the}} inhabitants of the Falkland Islands... if the population of the Falkland Islands did not desire to be British, the principle that the Queen wishes no unwilling subjects would long ago have prevailed; but we should create great difficulties for ourselves in other contexts, as well as in this context, if we rested our action purely and exclusively on the notion of restoring tolerable, acceptable conditions and self-determination to our fellow Britons on the Falkland Islands.... I do not think that we need be too nice <b>about</b> <b>saying</b> that we defend our territory as well as our people. There is nothing irrational, nothing to be ashamed of, in doing that. Indeed, it is impossible in the last resort to distinguish between the defence of territory and the defence of people".|$|E
