Thus, a graph is a pseudoforest {{if and only if}} it does not have the butterfly or the diamond as a minor. If one forbids only the diamond but not the butterfly, the resulting larger graph family consists of the cactus graphs and disjoint unions of multiple cactus graphs.|$|E
25|$|When doing {{trigonometry}} on Earth or {{the celestial}} sphere, {{the sides of}} the triangles are great circle arcs.

25|$|Light {{confined}} in a resonator will reflect multiple times from the mirrors, {{and due to}} the effects of interference, only certain patterns and frequencies of radiation will be sustained by the resonator, with the others being suppressed by destructive interference. In general, radiation patterns which are reproduced on every round-trip of the light through the resonator are the most stable, <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> eigenmodes, known as the modes, of the resonator.|$|E

25|$|Two joined monosaccharides {{are called}} a {{disaccharide}} <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> simplest polysaccharides. Examples include sucrose and lactose. They {{are composed of}} two monosaccharide units bound together by a covalent bond known as a glycosidic linkage formed via a dehydration reaction, resulting {{in the loss of}} a hydrogen atom from one monosaccharide and a hydroxyl group from the other. The formula of unmodified disaccharides is C12H22O11. Although there are numerous kinds of disaccharides, a handful of disaccharides are particularly notable.|$|E

25|$|The {{role of the}} GHB {{receptor}} in the behavioural effects {{induced by}} GHB is more complex. GHB receptors are densely expressed {{in many areas of}} the brain, including the cortex and hippocampus, <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> receptors that GHB displays the highest affinity for. There has been somewhat limited research into the GHB receptor; however, there is evidence that activation of the GHB receptor in some brain areas results in the release of glutamate, the principal excitatory neurotransmitter. Drugs that selectively activate the GHB receptor cause absence seizures in high doses, as do GHB and GABA(B) agonists.|$|E

25|$|Many African-American {{neighborhoods are}} located in inner cities, <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> mostly {{residential}} neighborhoods located closest to the central business district. The built environment is often row houses or brownstones, mixed with older single-family homes that may be converted to multi-family homes. In some areas there are larger apartment buildings. Shotgun houses {{are an important part}} of the built environment of some southern African-American neighborhoods. The houses consist of three to five rooms in a row with no hallways. This African-American house design is found in both rural and urban southern areas, mainly in African-American communities and neighborhoods.|$|E
25|$|The {{regulator}} can be DNA, RNA, {{protein and}} complexes of these. The interaction can be {{direct or indirect}} (through transcribed RNA or translated protein). In general, each mRNA molecule goes on to make a specific protein (or set of proteins). In some cases this protein will be structural, and will accumulate at the cell membrane or within the cell to give it particular structural properties. In other cases the protein will be an enzyme, i.e., a micro-machine that catalyses a certain reaction, such as the breakdown of a food source or toxin. Some proteins though serve only to activate other genes, <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> transcription factors that are the main players in regulatory networks or cascades. By binding to the promoter region {{at the start of}} other genes they turn them on, initiating the production of another protein, and so on. Some transcription factors are inhibitory.|$|E
25|$|Many {{plants have}} flowers <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> sexual organs of those plants. Flowers are usually hermaphroditic, {{producing}} {{both male and}} female gametes. The female parts, {{in the center of a}} flower, are the pistils, each unit consisting of a carpel, a style and a stigma. One or more of these reproductive units may be merged to form a single compound pistil. Within the carpels are ovules which develop into seeds after fertilization. The male parts of the flower are the stamens: these consist of long filaments arranged between the pistil and the petals that produce pollen in anthers at their tips. When a pollen grain lands upon the stigma on top of a carpel's style, it germinates to produce a pollen tube that grows down through the tissues of the style into the carpel, where it delivers male gamete nuclei to fertilize an ovule that eventually develops into a seed.|$|E

25|$|The {{data for}} an {{earthquake}} is plotted using a lower-hemisphere stereographic projection. The azimuth and take-off angle {{are used to}} plot the position of an individual seismic record. The take-off angle is the angle from the vertical of a seismic ray as it emerges from the earthquake focus. These angles are calculated from a standard set of tables that describe {{the relationship between the}} take-off angle and the distance between the focus and the observing station. By convention, filled symbols are used to plot data from stations where the P-wave first motion recorded was up (a compressive wave), hollow symbols for down (a tensional wave), with dots for stations with arrivals too weak {{to get a sense of}} motion. If there are sufficient observations, one may draw two well-constrained orthogonal great circles that divide the compressive from the tensional observations <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> nodal planes. Observations from stations with no clear first motion normally lie close to these planes. By convention the compressional quadrants are colour-filled and the tensional left white. The two nodal planes intersect at the N (neutral)-axis. The P and T axes are also often plotted; with the N axis these three directions respectively match the directions of the maximum, minimum and intermediate principal compressive stresses associated with the earthquake. The P-axis is plotted in the centre of the white segment, the T-axis in the centre of the colour-filled segment.|$|E

500|$|Saturn has 62 moons {{with known}} orbits; 53 {{of them have}} names, <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> ones with {{confirmed}} orbits. Most of them are quite small. Seven moons are {{large enough to be}} in hydrostatic equilibrium, including Titan, the second largest moon in the Solar System. Including these large moons, 24 of Saturn's moons are regular, and traditionally named after Titans or other figures associated with the mythological Saturn. The remaining 38, all small, are irregular, and classified by their orbital characteristics into Inuit, Norse, and Gallic groups, and their names are chosen from the corresponding mythologies. The rings of Saturn are made up of icy objects ranging in size from one centimetre to hundreds of metres, each of which is on its own orbit about the planet. Thus a precise number of Saturnian moons cannot be given, as there is no objective boundary between the countless small anonymous objects that form Saturn's ring system and the larger objects that have been named as moons. At least 150 [...] "moonlets" [...] embedded in the rings have been detected by the disturbance they create in the surrounding ring material, though this is thought to be only a small sample of the total population of such objects.|$|E
