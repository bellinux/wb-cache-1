40|$|A glucoamylase-immobilized {{system based}} on {{cross-linked}} gelatin nanoparticles (CLGNs) was prepared by coacervation method. This system exhibited characteristics of temperature-triggered phase transition, {{which could be used}} for enzyme immobilization and release. Their morphology and size distribution were examined by transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering particle size analyzer. Their temperature-triggered glucoamylase immobilization and release features were also further investigated under different temperatures. Results showed that the CLGNs were regularly spherical with diameters of 155 ± 5 nm. The loading efficiencies of glucoamylase immobilized by entrapment and adsorption methods were 59. 9 % and 24. 7 %, respectively. The immobilized enzyme was released when the system temperature was above 40 °C and performed high activity similar to free enzyme due to the optimum temperature range for glucoamylase. On the other hand, there was no enzyme release that could be found when the system temperature was below 40 °C. The efficiency of temperature-triggered release was as high as 99. 3 % for adsorption method, while the release of enzyme from the entrapment method was not detected. These results indicate that CLGNs are promising matrix for temperature-triggered glucoamylase immobilization and release by <b>adsorption</b> <b>immobilization</b> method...|$|E

Hybridization between the probe and its complementary oligonucleotides (the target) was investigated by monitoring guanine oxidation by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The pencil graphite electrode was made of ordinary pencil lead (type 4 B). The polished surface of the working electrode was activated by applying a potential of 1. 8 V for 5 min. Afterward, the dengue oligonucleotides probe was immobilized on the activated electrode by applying 0. 5 V to the electrode in 0. 5 M acetate buffer (pH 5. 0) for 5 min.

A time of five minutes and concentration of 1 μM were found to be the optimal conditions for probe immobilization. The electrochemical detection of annealing between the DNA probe (TS- 1 P) immobilized on the modified electrode, and the target (TS- 1 T) was achieved.

40|$|Pectinases, {{also known}} as pectolytic or pectic enzymes, belong {{to the family of}} polysaccharidases that {{contribute}} to the breakdown of pectins from a variety of plants. Due to versatility in types and reactions catalyzed by these pectin degrading enzymes they have been the focus of research from many decades. The day by day growing demand of pectinases to be employed at commercial level has rendered the research of finding novel pectinases with improved activities and their modification for higher thermal and operational stabilities with affordable costs. In the first step of the present study, cultural conditions were optimized for enhanced production of exo-PG by Penicillium notatum and Cariolus versicolor. Different agricultural wastes were used as substrates for their potential to be used for the production of exo-PG under solid state fermentation conditions. Among these, the wheat bran was proved to be the best substrate for production of exo-PG under solid state fermentation conditions. Under optimized conditions the enzyme activity was observed to be 113 U/gds and 100 U/gds using Penicillium notatum and Cariolus versicolor respectively. Penicillium notatum provided higher activities of exo-PG so it was selected for further production optimization studies under RSM approach which resulted in 131 % improvement in activity of exo-PG. Penicillium notatum exo-PG was purified to homogeneity by 3 step purification strategy to achieve 3. 05 fold purified enzyme with 2. 5 % recovery and a specific activity of 27. 79 U/mg. 2 different isoforms of exo-PG were detected during column purification with molecular weight of one isoform 20 kDa while other showed 85 kDa after SDS-PAGE. Exo-PGI was optimally active at pH 6. 0 and 50 Â¢XC. The Michaelis-Menten constants km and Vmax of exo-PGI from Penicillium notatum for pectin hydrolysis at optimum temperature were 16. 6 mg/mL and 20 Æ’Ã�mol/mL min- 1 respectively. The Penicillium notatum exo-PGI was stable in the broad acidic pH range, with maximum stability in the range of 4. 5 - 6. 0. The enzyme followed biphasic deactivation kinetics. Phase-I of the exo-PGI showed a half-life of 6. 83 min and 2. 39 min at 55 and 80 Â¢XC respectively and phase-II of the enzyme showed a half-life of 63. 57 min. and 22. 72 minutes at 55 and 80 Â¢XC respectively. The activation energy for denaturation was 51. 66 kJ/mole and 44. 06 kJ/mole for the phase-I and phase-II of the exo-PGI respectively. The enzyme activity was enhanced significantly by Mn 2 +. Exposure to hydrophobic environment (urea solution) decreased the enzyme activity. Then the Penicillium notatum exo-PGI was immobilized by carrier bound techniques of immobilization on sodium alginate support in order to improve the thermal stability characteristics. Covalent immobilization was more efficient in terms of high relative activity and immobilization efficiency as compared to <b>adsorption</b> <b>immobilization</b> on Naalginate. Both the immobilization techniques greatly enhanced the thermal stability of enzyme. Temperature optima for exo-PGI activity shifted to higher temperatures as compared to free enzyme. The reusability of immobilized enzyme was very good in both cases of immobilization. Finally the application potential of this exo-PGI from Penicillium notatum was checked by treating various fruit juices. Exo-PGI treatments resulted in significant clarification of fruit juices as evaluated by turbidity, viscosity and absorbance (660 nm) measurements...|$|E

Substrate-mediated gene delivery describes the delivery of plasmid DNA or DNA complexed with nonviral vectors to cells from a surface, with the DNA immobilized to a substrate through specific or nonspecific interactions. In this work, DNA-nanoparticle (DNA–NP) adsorption to substrates is evaluated using combinatorial, in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (SE/QCM-D), to evaluate the basic dynamic processes involved in the <b>adsorption</b> and <b>immobilization</b> of DNA–NP complexes to substrates. The concentration of DNA–NP solutions influences the adsorbed DNA–NP surface mass, which increases {{by a factor of}} approximately 6 (detected by SE) and approximately 4. 5 -fold (detected by QCM-D), as the DNA concentration increases from 1. 5 μg/mL to 15 μg/mL, with an increase in layer porosity.

In this work we present our recent results on chemical modification of the nanodiamond surface with phosphate groups and their electrochemically assisted immobilization on titanium-based materials to increase adhesion at biomaterial surfaces. The starting material is detonation nanodiamond, which exhibits a heterogeneous surface due to the functional groups resulting from the nitrogen-rich explosives and the subsequent purification steps after detonation synthesis. Nanodiamond surfaces are chemically homogenized before proceeding with further functionalization. Suspensions of resulting surface-modified nanodiamonds are applied to the titanium alloy surfaces and the nanodiamonds subsequently fixed by electrochemical immobilization. Titanium and its alloys have been widely used in bone and dental implants for being a metal that is biocompatible with body tissues and able to bind with adjacent bone during healing. In order to improve titanium material properties towards biomedical applications the authors aim to increase adhesion to bone material by incorporating nanodiamonds into the implant surface, namely the anodically grown titanium dioxide layer.

Four unsaturated steady state experiments were carried out on each monolith using two different imposed fluxes (referred to as low and high). First a chloride breakthrough experiment was performed to identify the basic transport processes followed by sulphate breakthrough experiment for {{the identification of the}} important sulphate transport processes. Water and solute (chloride and sulphate) mass balances were made to evaluate effective sulphate transformations at the scale of the monolith. The relative water mass balance errors ranged between - 4. 0 % and 5. 0 %. The chloride mass balances were almost as good as those obtained for water, whereas the sulphate mass balance revealed that sulphate was subjected to <b>adsorption</b> and <b>immobilization</b> during the transport. The high flux sulphate experiments resulted in relatively large mass balance discrepancies compared to the low flux sulphate experiments. The sulphate breakthrough curves (BTCs) were somewhat retarded in the loamy monoliths whereas both chloride and sulphate BTCs were significantly affected by preferential flow in the sandy loam monoliths. Standard batch experiments showed that the adsorption isotherm was linear and immobilization occurred in both soils studied whereas net mineralization was essentially low.

40|$|LiCl is a kosmotrope that {{generally}} promotes protein salvation in aqueous solutions. Herein {{we report that}} LiCl embedded in electrospun polymeric nanofibers interestingly induced an abnormal protein adsorption and substantially augmented the adsorption capacity of the fibers. As a result, equilibrium protein loadings reached over 64 % (w/w) of the dry mass of fibers, 9 -fold higher than that observed {{in the absence of}} the salt. The adsorption appeared to be irreversible such that little protein loss was observed even after washing the fibers vigorously with fresh buffer solutions. We further examined the application of such intensified protein <b>adsorption</b> for enzyme <b>immobilization.</b> Proteins including bovine serum albumin (BSA) and prolamine were first adsorbed, followed by covalent attachment of an outer layer of an enzyme, alpha-chymotrypsin. Such a multilayer-structured nanofibrous enzyme exhibited extremely high stability with no obvious activity loss even after being incubated for 8 months at 4 degrees C in aqueous buffer solution. The LiCl induced irreversible protein adsorption, which has been largely ignored in previous studies with electrospun materials, rendering an interesting scenario of interfacial protein-material interactions. It also reveals a new mechanism in controlling and fabricating molecular interactions at interfaces for development of a broad range of biomaterials...|$|R
40|$|This work {{reports the}} {{adsorption}} of glucose oxidase (GOx) in particle-loaded hollow fibers using polyethersulfone as the matrix and Lewatit strong cation-exchange resins as the functional support. The activity of adsorbed GOx was evaluated {{under the same}} pH conditions as the <b>adsorption.</b> Static enzyme <b>immobilization</b> tests yielded high adsorption values at pHs below the isoelectric point (pI) of GOx, where the enzyme assumes the cationic form and adsorbs via electrostatic interaction. The adsorption by electrostatic interactions could be described by a Langmuir isotherm at pH values below the pI of GOx. Adsorption performed above the pI takes place preferentially via hydrophobic interactions. Dynamic GOx adsorption experiments resulted in the same values as those obtained in static experiments. Below the pI of the enzyme, the adsorption {{was found to be}} pH dependent. Above the pI of GOx, the adsorption was lower and independent of the pH. Formation of GOx multilayers was observed for all applied pH values. Dynamic glucose conversion measurements showed that the immobilized GOx retains an appreciable activity after adsorption via both methods. GOx immobilized via hydrophobic interactions yielded the highest activity values. Enzymes immobilized via electrostatic interaction showed multilayer adsorption, resulting in a strongly reduced enzymatic activity. The highest enzymatic activity of the adsorbed GOx was found for pH 5. 0...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of hybrid organic-inorganic membranes {{with a low}} propensity for protein adsorption and highly uniform nanometre size pores is described. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) monolayers were grafted to nanoporous alumina membranes using covalent silane and physical <b>adsorption</b> poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) <b>immobilization</b> chemistries. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron microscopy were used to investigate the chemical and physical surface properties of the membranes. The adsorption behaviour of a serum albumin on the membranes was characterized with fluorescence spectroscopy and {{it was determined that}} the PEG coating reduced nonspecific protein adsorption to a level too small to be measured. The gas and liquid permeabilities of membranes were measured to determine if the surface chemistries changed the functional behaviour of the membranes. Surprisingly, the silane chemistry produced little change in the permeabilities while polymer adsorption resulted in a total loss of water permeability. The diffusion of ovalbumin through the membranes was also measured and compared with a theoretical value. Diffusion of ovalbumin through the silane-PEG-modified membranes was found to be 50 % slower than the unmodified membranes, which suggests that the pores are coated with a dense film of PEG. These results suggest that hybrid organic-inorganic membranes can provide significantly improved functional behaviour over existing organic or inorganic membranes...|$|R

40|$|This {{work was}} started with {{isolation}} of humic acid from peat soil and chitin from crab shell, immobilization of humic acid on chitin, and characterization of adsorbents of C and HAC. Optimum condition was studied by interacting the adsorbents with Ag(S 2 O 3) 23 - in a synthetic solution on various  of pH from 2 to 10. Adsorption rate was studied by interacting the adsorbent with Ag(S 2 O 3) 23 - in the synthetic solution on various time from 2 to 120 minutes. The {{determination of the}} energy and the capacity of adsorption were studied by interacting the adsorbent with Ag(S 2 O 3) 23 - on various initial concentration from 2 to 75 ppm. Moreover, the mechanism of adsorption was studied by applying a sequential desorption using H 2 O, Na 2 EDTA 0. 1 M, KSCN 0. 5 M, and KOH 1 M. The adsorption of Ag(S 2 O 3) 23 - in photography wastewater on C and on HAC were studied at the same condition as obtained for the synthetic solution. The result showed that pH 2 was the optimum adsorption condition for Ag(S 2 O 3) 23 - in the synthetic solution on both C and HAC adsorbents. Ag(S 2 O 3) 23 - in the synthetic solution was chemically adsorbed on C and on HAC, involving energy adsorption of 22. 74 – 23. 30 kJ/mole, respectively. Adsorption of Ag(S 2 O 3) 23 - on C was faster than that on HAC with the rate constants for adsorbent C and HAC were 73 x 10 - 4 and 46 x 10 - 4 minute- 1, respectively. Adsorption capacity of Ag(S 2 O 3) 23 - on C and on HAC were 2. 107 x 10 - 4 and 1. 818 x 10 - 4 mole/g, respectively. The amount of Ag(S 2 O 3) 23 - in photography wastewater that was adsorbed on C and on HAC were 13. 52 and 12. 47 mg/L, respectively. The hydrogen bonding and ion exchange were the dominant mechanism of adsorption. Key words: Ag(S 2 O 3) 23 -, <b>adsorption,</b> chitin, <b>immobilization,</b> humic acid...|$|R
40|$|Single-molecule {{fluorescence}} (SMF) microscopy is {{a powerful}} technique that provides high sensitivity and nanometer-scale resolution for biological imaging. The emission profile of an isolated fluorescent molecule allows the emitter position to be determined on a scale far smaller than the standard diffraction limit of light with a precision that improves {{with the number of}} detected photons. While in vitro implementations of SMF have achieved 1. 5 -nm localization precisions, an outstanding problem in the field is to improve the resolution of SMF imaging in live cells; this has been generally limited to 10 – 40 nm. The main problem is technological: fluorescent proteins (FPs), the genetically encodable labels widely used for biological imaging, are dimmer and shorter lived than the organic dyes employed in vitro. Increasing FP brightness and photostability will significantly improve the precision with which these fluorescent probes are localized in vivo down to a few nanometers, as well as increase average trajectory length for single-particle tracking, and these advances will enable studies of intracellular processes on the molecular scale. In this Thesis, we use SMF microscopy to characterize fluorescence and attain super-resolution images, and we demonstrate that nanoparticle plasmonics can improve both the brightness and photostability of FPs. The localized surface plasmon mode, or collective oscillation of free electrons, produces a highly enhanced field in the near field of a metal nanostructure. Here, by positioning FPs in the near field of gold nanorods via <b>adsorption</b> or <b>immobilization,</b> we use this coupling to more than double the emission rate of the red FP mCherry, and determine that coupled molecules of the photo-activatable FP PAmCherry emit three times more photons prior to photobleaching. We then extend our methods to in vivo experiments, in which gold nanotriangle arrays serve as extracellular imaging substrates to enhance the emission from membrane-bound proteins in live bacterial cells. Finally, we demonstrate selective excitation of the longitudinal mode of gold nanorods using polarization, and consequently tune the amount of plasmon-enhanced emission observed. The work in this Thesis demonstrates the power of plasmon-enhanced single-molecule fluorescence to strongly impact the bio-imaging field, with implications for human health and disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of various nanomaterials {{over the last}} few decades has led to many applications for these materials in liquid chromatography (LC). This review will look at the types of nanomaterials that have been incorporated into LC systems and the applications that have been explored for such systems. A number of carbon-based nanomaterials and inorganic nanomaterials have been considered for use in LC, ranging from carbon nanotubes, fullerenes and nanodiamonds to metal nanoparticles and nanostructures based on silica, alumina, zirconia and titanium dioxide. Many ways have been described for incorporating these nanomaterials into LC systems. These methods have included covalent <b>immobilization,</b> <b>adsorption,</b> entrapment, and the synthesis or direct {{development of}} nanomaterials as part of a chromatographic support. Nanomaterials have been used in many types of LC. These applications have included the reversed-phase, normal-phase, ion-exchange, and affinity modes of LC, as well as related methods such as chiral separations, ion-pair chromatography and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography. Both small and large analytes (e. g., dyes, drugs, amino acids, peptides and proteins) have been used to evaluate possible applications for these nanomaterial-based methods. The use of nanomaterials in columns, capillaries and planar chromatography has been considered as part of these efforts. Potential advantages of nanomaterials in these applications have included their good chemical and physical stabilities, the variety of interactions many nanomaterials can have with analytes, and their unique retention properties in some separation formats...|$|R
40|$|A multi-spot (16 spots) light-addressable {{potentiometric}} sensor (MLAPS) consisting of an Al–p-Si–SiO 2 structure modified {{with a weak}} polyelectrolyte layer of PAH (poly(allylamine hydrochloride)) was applied for the label-free electrical detection of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) immobilization and hybridization by the intrinsic molecular charge for the first time. To achieve a preferentially flat orientation of DNA strands and thus, to reduce {{the distance between the}} DNA charge and MLAPS surface, the negatively charged probe single-stranded DNAs (ssDNA) were electrostatically adsorbed onto the positively charged PAH layer using a simple layer-by-layer (LbL) technique. In this way, more DNA charge can be positioned within the Debye length, yielding a higher sensor signal. The surface potential changes in each spot induced due to the surface modification steps (PAH <b>adsorption,</b> probe ssDNA <b>immobilization,</b> hybridization with complementary target DNA (cDNA), non-specific adsorption of mismatched ssDNA) were determined from the shifts of photocurrent–voltage curves along the voltage axis. A high sensor signal of 83 mV was registered after immobilization of probe ssDNA onto the PAH layer. The hybridization signal increases from 5 mV to 32 mV with increasing the concentration of cDNA from 0. 1 nM to 5 μM. In contrast, a small signal of 5 mV was recorded in the case of non-specific adsorption of fully mismatched ssDNA (5 μM). The obtained results demonstrate the potential of the MLAPS in combination with the simple and rapid LbL immobilization technique as a promising platform for the future development of multi-spot light-addressable label-free DNA chips with direct electrical readout...|$|R
