5|$|In 2005 the Defense Department {{announced}} that it would be shifting 18,000 jobs to Fort Belvoir in Virginia and at least 5,000 jobs to Fort Meade in Maryland by 2012, <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> year's Base Realignment and Closure plan. In anticipation of such a move, local officials and the military proposed extending the Blue and Green Lines to service each base. The proposed extension of the Green Line could cost $100 million per mile ($60 million per kilometer), and a light rail extension to Fort Belvoir was estimated to cost up to $800 million. Neither proposal has established timelines for planning or construction.|$|E

5|$|Dalton {{applied the}} logic of abolitionism {{to the cause of}} women's freedom. She said that just as no one should be made a slave because of their race, women should not have to be subservient because of their gender. She saw the Victorian ideals for women in {{marriage}} <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> slavish subservience. She argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry so she could still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and her own body. Dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed to decide when they have their first child. Some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for a Mormon woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws.|$|E

5|$|In 1873, Gladstone {{brought forward}} {{legislation}} {{to establish a}} Catholic university in Dublin. This divided the Liberals, and on 12 March an alliance of Conservatives and Irish Catholics defeated the government by three votes. Gladstone resigned, and the Queen sent for Disraeli, who refused to take office. Without a general election, a Conservative government would be another minority, dependent for survival on the division of its opponents. Disraeli wanted the power a majority would bring, and felt he could gain it later by leaving the Liberals in office now. Gladstone's government struggled on, beset by scandal and unimproved by a reshuffle. <b>As</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> change, Gladstone took on the office of Chancellor, leading to questions {{as to whether he}} had to stand for re-election on taking on a second ministryâ€”until the 1920s, MPs becoming ministers, thus taking an office of profit under the Crown, had to seek re-election.|$|E
5|$|People {{relive the}} Wild West both {{historically}} and {{in popular culture}} by participating in cowboy action shooting events, where each gunslinger adopts {{his or her own}} look representing a character from Western life in the late 1800s, and <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> character, chooses an alias to go by. The sport originated in Southern California, USA, in the early 1980s but is now practiced in many places with several sanctioning organizations including the Single Action Shooting Society (SASS), Western Action Shootists Association (WASA), and National Congress of Old West Shooters (NCOWS), as well as others in the USA and in other countries. There are different categories shooters can compete in. There's the gunfighter, frontiersman, classic cowboy and duelist - each with its own specifications.|$|E
