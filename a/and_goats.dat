5|$|Meat, {{mainly from}} farmed animals, {{is a major}} source of dietary protein around the world, {{averaging}} about 8% of man's energy intake. The actual types eaten depend on local preferences, availability, cost and other factors, with cattle, sheep, pigs <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> being the main species involved. Cattle generally produce a single offspring annually which takes more than a year to mature; sheep <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> often have twins and these are ready for slaughter in less than a year; pigs are more prolific, producing more than one litter of up to about 11 piglets each year. Horses, donkeys, deer, buffalo, llamas, alpacas, guanacos and vicunas are farmed for meat in various regions. Some desirable traits of animals raised for meat include fecundity, hardiness, fast growth rate, ease of management and high food conversion efficiency. About half of the world's meat is produced from animals grazing on open ranges or on enclosed pastures, the other half being produced intensively in various factory-farming systems; these are mostly cows, pigs or poultry, and often reared indoors, typically at high densities.|$|E
5|$|Methods used to {{recreate}} the bog turtle's habitat include: controlled burns to limit the growth of overshadowing trees and underbrush (thus bringing the habitat back to early successional); grazing livestock such as cows <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> in the desired habitat area (creating pockets of water and freshly churned mud); and promoting beaver activity, including dam construction in and around wetlands.|$|E
5|$|Sheep <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> {{are closely}} related: both {{are in the}} {{subfamily}} Caprinae. However, they are separate species, so hybrids rarely occur, and are always infertile. A hybrid of a ewe and a buck (a male goat) is called a sheep-goat hybrid (only a single such animal has been confirmed), and {{is not to be}} confused with the sheep-goat chimera, though both are known as geep. Visual differences between sheep <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> include the beard of goats and divided upper lip of sheep. Sheep tails also hang down, even when short or docked, while the short tails of goats are held upwards. Also, sheep breeds are often naturally polled (either in both sexes or just in the female), while naturally polled goats are rare (though many are polled artificially). Males of the two species differ in that buck goats acquire a unique and strong odor during the rut, whereas rams do not.|$|E

The district level cattle, sheep <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> population density per km 2 was calculated by dividing the total cattle, sheep <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> population {{the district}} owns by the area in km 2 of the district.

Here {{it is important to note}} that, there might be variations in livestock population densities among peasant associations within a given district which this study didn’t consider.|$|R

5|$|A {{wide array}} of {{bacterial}} and viral diseases affect sheep. Diseases of the hoof, such as foot rot and foot scald may occur, and are treated with footbaths and other remedies. These painful conditions cause lameness and hinder feeding. Ovine Johne's disease is a wasting disease that affects young sheep. Bluetongue disease is an insect-borne illness causing fever and inflammation of the mucous membranes. Ovine rinderpest (or peste des petits ruminants) is a highly contagious and often fatal viral disease affecting sheep <b>and</b> <b>goats.</b>|$|E
5|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that the plant may be mildly toxic. The noxious odours have been associated with nausea and headaches, as well as with contact dermatitis reported in both humans and sheep, who also developed weakness and paralysis. It contains a quinone irritant, 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone, as well as active quassinoids (ailanthone itself being one) which may account for these effects, but they have, however, proved difficult or impossible to reproduce in humans <b>and</b> <b>goats.</b> In one trial a tincture from the blossom and foliage caused nausea, vomiting and muscular relaxation.|$|E
5|$|Biblical and extrabiblical {{evidence}} suggests that of the Arabian tribes, the Qedarites were most prominent in their contacts with the world outside of the Arabian Peninsula.

Pastoralists and traders in livestock, such as male lambs, rams <b>and</b> <b>goats,</b> they also {{played a key role}} in the prosperity of Gaza's incense trade, controlling traffic in the desert regions between Egypt and Palestine. As a result of their trading activities, there were clans from among the Qedarites that became wealthy.|$|E
40|$|Effect {{of various}} voltage of {{electrical}} stimulation (ES) on meat quality of lamb <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> was investigated {{by using a}} total of 36 animals at 3 – 5 years old. Constant 50 [*]Hz frequency and 50, 100, and 250 [*]V, 90 [*]sec of ES were administered to 1 / 2 carcasses and were examined according their textural, physicochemical, and sensorial characteristics. ES decreased the pH values of lamb <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> meat, <b>and</b> accelerated the rigor mortis (< 0. 05). Additionally, ES enhanced the water activity, water-holding capacity, and drip loss of both animals. Shear force varied between lamb <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> meat, <b>and</b> tenderness was improved depending on voltage range used (< 0. 001). ES caused difference in instrumental colour (CIE ∗, ∗, ∗) values of lamb <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> meat compared with the control groups (< 0. 05) during aging period at 4 °C. Sensorial characteristics were also improved with various levels of ES treatments. In conclusion, ES had positive effects on meat quality of lamb <b>and</b> <b>goat,</b> in contrast to undesirable consumer preferences...|$|R
40|$|Sheep <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> {{production}} is small in Finland. There is, however, a heterogeneous group of 3 000 producers of sheep or goats. Most of them {{only have a}} few animals. This report explores how epizootic diseases may reach the sheep <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> sector in Finland, and what role it might have as a disease transmitter in Finnish animal production. The disease situation of the Finnish sheep <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> sector is good. The spread of diseases into the country seems relatively unlikely, as the import of live animals and gametes is low. On the other hand, it is more difficult {{to prevent the spread of}} vector borne diseases to Finland. Sheep <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> farms are scattered relatively sparsely, which is why the risk of spread of diseases to neighboring farms does not seem very likely. In addition, movements of animals and indirect contacts between farms are far more uncommon than in the pig and cattle industries. Contacts to other animal production are also few. However, the level of biosecurity is not as good on sheep <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> farms as on cattle and pig farms...|$|R

5|$|During {{the first}} kingdom period, the palace {{controlled}} the economy, but wealthy families managed their financial affairs without government intervention.

It {{is estimated that}} around 40,000 persons contributed to this system, but in general, and unlike in Mesopotamia, land stayed {{in the hands of}} villages, which paid an annual share to the palace. Agriculture was mainly pastoral; large herds of cattle were managed by the palace. The city's inhabitants owned around 140,000 head of sheep <b>and</b> <b>goats,</b> and 9,000 cattle.|$|E
