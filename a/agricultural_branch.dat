5|$|Over {{the next}} several decades, South Framingham became an {{important}} regional rail hub. The Boston and Worcester built its 12-mile Milford Branch from South Framingham to Milford via Holliston in 1848. The next year, the B built a short branch to Framingham Center, which the B mainline had bypassed. This line, later called the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Branch</b> Railroad, was realigned near Framingham Center and extended to Pratts Junction in Sterling in 1855. Franklin Street {{was built on the}} former branch right of way. The <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Branch</b> and the Framingham & Lowell (which branched off it at Framingham Center) were the northernmost section of the Old Colony Railroad, which took over the lines in 1879.|$|E
5|$|Due in {{no small}} part to the {{presence}} of the station, South Framingham eclipsed Framingham Center in size; on January 8, 1915, the station was renamed Framingham. Traffic on the B and its various branch lines, though, decreased after World War I. In 1919, <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Branch</b> trains were cut to Framingham, requiring a transfer to continue Boston or Mansfield. The line was cut back to Marlborough in 1931, and passenger service ended in 1937. Passenger service on the Mansfield & Framingham ended in 1933. The Milford Branch lasted the longest of the Boston & Albany branch lines; it was cut to one daily trip in 1953 and terminated in April 1959.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the main}} depot at the South Framingham junction, Framingham has been {{served by a}} number of {{stations}} inside or just outside its borders. The <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Branch</b> included three of these stations. One, variously known as Montwait, Mt. Wayte, and Lakeview, was located just north of Mt. Wayte Avenue {{at the north end of}} Farm Pond. The station served the Montwait neighborhood as well as the Montwait Camp Ground, a worship camp used by Methodist, Chautaqua, and later Pentecostal groups from the 1870s to the 1910s. The Framingham Centre station – at times known simply as Framingham – located at Maynard Street adjacent to Route 9. It was opened in 1849 when the branch to Framingham Center was completed. A new station was built in 1855 when the branch was realigned and extended. It also served the Framingham & Lowell after that line opened in 1871. A freight house and coal shed were located nearby to the north. Fayville station was located just over the Southborough border in the Fayville village and also served the western reaches of Framingham. The station was placed at Central Street between Route 9 and Route 30 at or after the 1855 opening of the line. The three stations closed with the end of passenger service on the branch in 1937; none of the buildings remain.|$|E
50|$|The kibbutz {{operates}} a holiday resort and a fish restaurant. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>branches</b> include banana plantations and dairy farming. The kibbutz built a 2,500-seat concert hall {{to accommodate the}} Ein Gev Music Festival, held annually during Passover.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>branches</b> of Gedera in {{its early}} years were grapes and grains. Citrus and other field crops were added later. In the 1930s, several industries were established and the moshava became a vacation resort with convalescence and rest homes.|$|R
50|$|Work was an {{essential}} building block {{of the collective}} education.

25|$|The Framingham Branch {{opened in}} 1849, running 2.06 miles (3.3km) from Framingham to Framingham Centre. The <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Branch</b> Railroad was {{incorporated}} in 1847 and opened in 1855, continuing the branch to Northborough, and to Pratts Junction in 1866. It was leased by the B in 1853, but consolidated into the Boston, Clinton, Fitchburg and New Bedford Railroad in 1876 and leased to the Old Colony Railroad in 1879 after changing {{its name to}} the Boston, Clinton and Fitchburg Railroad in 1867. This company also used the Framingham Branch as part of its main line.|$|E
25|$|After statehood, {{priority}} {{was given to}} establishing industries in areas slated for development, among them Lachish, Ashkelon, the Negev and Galilee. The expansion of Israel's textile industry was {{a consequence of the}} development of cotton growing as a profitable <b>agricultural</b> <b>branch.</b> By the late 1960s, textiles were one of the largest industrial branches in Israel, second only to the foodstuff industry. Textiles constituted about 12% of industrial exports, becoming the second-largest export branch after polished diamonds. In the 1990s, cheap East Asian labor decreased the profitability of the sector. Much of the work was subcontracted to 400 Israeli Arab sewing shops. As these closed down, Israeli firms, among them Delta, Polgat, Argeman and Kitan, began doing their sewing work in Jordan and Egypt, usually under the QIZ arrangement. In the early 2000s, Israeli companies had 30 plants in Jordan. Israeli exports reached $370million a year, supplying such retailers and designers as Marks & Spencer, The Gap, Victoria's Secret, Walmart, Sears, Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, and Donna Karan.|$|E
500|$|Cal Poly Pomona's {{academic}} offerings {{have evolved}} throughout the years. Prior to the ownership shift to Cal Poly SLO in 1938, the Voorhis School for Boys in San Dimas had been providing educational offerings in [...] "music, bookkeeping, agriculture, library work, carpentry, nature study, machine shop, and printing" [...] coupled with Christian religious fundamentals to an all-male student body with poor, underage boys. In 1938, the campus became the <b>agricultural</b> <b>branch</b> of Cal Poly SLO {{when a small}} staff was transfer from San Luis Obispo along with group of agricultural inspection students. Thus, Cal Poly at Pomona (then just Cal Poly) began offering Associate's degrees in 1938 and Bachelor's degrees in 1940 when, despite legislative opposition from pro-University of California members in Sacramento, president Julian McPhee asked allied members Armistead B. Carter and Daniel C. Murphy to introduce the bill when two opposing members were not present to vote. Following the governance breakup with the San Luis Obispo in 1966, and as outlined by the 1960 California Master Plan for Higher Education, Cal Poly continued [...] "offer undergraduate and graduate instruction through the master's degree in the liberal arts and sciences and professional education, including teacher education." [...] Currently, Cal Poly promotes a [...] "learn by doing" [...] philosophy, where {{an essential part of}} the curriculum is hands-on application of knowledge.|$|E

2500|$|In 1953 an <b>agricultural</b> <b>branch</b> of St. John’s College, called Lynam College, {{was opened}} in Stann Creek on land lent by the government. The college {{operated}} until 1971 when {{lack of funding}} and criticism {{that it was not}} fulfilling its function as an agricultural school caused its closing. St. John's Junior College grew out of the Sixth Form (1952) that was connected to the high school (1887). In 1966 it began offering associate degrees in affiliation with the American Association of Community Colleges. Two more Catholic junior colleges were founded in the 1990s. Muffles Junior College near Orange Walk Town was opened in 1992. It grew out of Muffles High School that originated in 1953. And Sacred Heart Junior College in San Ignacio Town was opened in 1999. It grew out of Sacred Heart High School which was the first secondary school in Cayo District when it opened in 1960. Seminarians from nearby St. Benedict's attend Sacred Heart Junior College. By 2015 the Catholic church had 148 elementary schools, attached to all of its 18 parishes and to most all of its mission stations, along with 11 high schools and 3 junior colleges. Not until 1986 did the government found a university independent of church control. There have been efforts to detach education from the British A-level system and associate it more closely to the American system of accreditation, but the Chamber of Commerce and Rotary business people resisted.|$|E

50|$|Gorbachev brought perestroika to the Soviet Union's foreign {{economic}} sector with measures that Soviet economists considered bold at that time.

In addition, regional and local organizations and individual state enterprises were permitted to conduct foreign trade.
