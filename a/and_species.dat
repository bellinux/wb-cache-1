5|$|Biological {{classification}} is {{a critical}} component of the taxonomic process. As a result, it informs the user as to what the relatives of the taxon are hypothesized to be.

40|$|The calliphorids flies {{comprise}} a heterogenous family {{found in all}} zoogeographical regions, with over 1, 000 <b>species</b> <b>and</b> 150 genera described.

In this paper, we list all species of Calliphoridae found in the Americas south of Mexico, based on reports in the literature between the years 1960 and 2012.

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{survey of}} the ectoparasites infesting bats in Paraguay provides information regarding the taxonomy and host distribution of streblid bat flies at a geographic interface between subtropical and temperate habitats. Five families of bats representing 45 species, including Molossidae (5 genera <b>and</b> 15 <b>species),</b> Natalidae (1 genus <b>and</b> 1 <b>species),</b> Phyllostomidae (11 genera <b>and</b> 15 <b>species),</b> Noctilionidae (1 genus <b>and</b> 2 <b>species),</b> <b>and</b> Vespertilionidae (4 genera <b>and</b> 12 <b>species)</b> were collected from 24 localities across Paraguay and sampled for ectoparasites. In total, 2, 467 bat flies were collected, representing 11 genera <b>and</b> 31 nominal <b>species</b> of Streblidae, of which 6 genera <b>and</b> 24 <b>species</b> are new records for Paraguay. No streblids were collected from vespertilionid bats; 23 species infested phyllostomids, 6 species noctilionids, 1 <b>species</b> a natalid, <b>and</b> 1 <b>species</b> molossids. Streblid bat flies were highly specific to certain host groups <b>and</b> individual host <b>species,</b> <b>and</b> their geographic distributions closely followed those of their host bats. Of 31 streblid species surveyed, 27 were monoxenous (i. e., associated with a single host <b>species),</b> <b>and</b> 4 were stenoxenous (i. e., associated {{with a group of}} phylogenetically related hosts). The number of streblid species is greatly reduced in the Chaco region west of the Paraguay River, largely {{because of the lack of}} phyllostomid host bats...|$|R
