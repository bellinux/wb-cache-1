He viewed the recording sessions in Atlanta as eclectic and described Cole's ambition: [...] "he shared with me her hope of making a country-soul record in Memphis; she also spoke of doing a piano-voice album and of recording in Spanish". In an interview with American Songwriter, Cole said the album [...] "was born out of desperation" [...] to record a pop and urban project rather than a jazz one. She sought to avoid being typecast as a jazz singer by returning to R and demanding more artistic control.
