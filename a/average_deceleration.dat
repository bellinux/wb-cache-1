Solutions are often sought in the ``washout'' algorithm, with linear accelerations simulated by an empirically chosen combination of translation and tilt-coordination, based on the incapacity of otolith organs to distinguish between inclination {{of the head and}} linear acceleration. In this study, we investigated the most effective combination of tilt and translation to provide a realistic perception of movement. We tested 3 different braking intensities (deceleration), each with 5 inverse proportional tilt/translation ratios.

We find that perceived intensity of braking depends on the tilt/translation ratio used: for small and <b>average</b> <b>decelerations</b> (0. 6 and 1. 0 m/s(2)), increased tilt yielded an increased overestimation of braking, inverse proportionally with intensity; for high decelerations (1. 4 m/s(2)), on half the conditions braking was overestimated with more tilt than translation and underestimated with more translation than tilt.

Methods and resultsIn 48 patients with HCM who had angiographically normal coronary artery, coronary flow velocity in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and intramyocardial coronary artery (IMCA) derived from LAD were evaluated using transthoracic Doppler echocardiography. Two clearly different flow patterns in the IMCA were observed in patients with HCM. Twenty-seven HCM patients (group A) had slow deceleration slope in the IMCA flow (<b>average</b> diastolic <b>deceleration</b> time, 989 ± 338; range, 585 – 1680) and the remaining 21 patients (group B) had steep deceleration slope with diastolic deceleration time < 300 ms, resulting in a no reflow-like pattern in the IMCA flow (<b>average</b> diastolic <b>deceleration</b> time, 166 ± 67; range, 55 – 280). There {{were no significant differences}} in the clinical characteristics and LAD flow velocity profiles between the two groups. The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms (chest pain or syncope) was significantly higher in group B than in group A (67 % vs. 26 %, p< 0. 01).

40|$|The {{ability of}} pulsed Doppler {{echocardiography}} to identify patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction was evaluated in 12 patients with dilated (congestive) cardiomyopathy. A range-gated, spectrum analyzer-based Doppler velocimeter {{was used to}} record blood flow velocity in the ascending aorta and main pulmonary artery. The following blood flow velocity parameters were measured or derived: peak flow velocity, acceleration time, average acceleration, deceleration time, <b>average</b> <b>deceleration,</b> ejection time, and aortic flow velocity integral. Doppler blood flow velocity data in the cardiomyopathy patients were compared to data from 20 normal subjects. Measurements from the ascending aorta revealed that peak aortic flow velocity discriminated between cardiomyopathy patients (mean 47 cm/sec, range 35 to 62) and normal subjects (mean 92 cm/sec, range 72 to 120) with no overlap in data (p < 0. 001). Aortic flow velocity integral was also able to separate the patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (mean 6. 7 cm, range 3. 5 to 9. 1) from normal subjects (mean 15. 7 cm, range 12. 6 to 22. 5) with no overlap in data (p < 0. 001). Although mean values for average aortic acceleration and aortic ejection time were also significantly different (both p < 0. 005), there was some overlap between the two groups. Pulmonary artery blood flow studies demonstrated significantly increased average acceleration, as well as decreased ejection time (both p < 0. 05), but no difference in <b>average</b> <b>deceleration</b> or peak flow velocity in cardiomyopathy patients compared to normals. Compared to pulmonary flow measurements, aortic Doppler flow velocity measurements allowed better separation of cardiomyopathy and normal groups. In addition, aortic peak flow velocity appeared to correlate well (r = 0. 83) with M-mode echocardiographic measurement of left ventricular percent fractional shortening; both parameters were equally useful in discriminating patients with normal left ventricular function from those with global dysfunction (dilated cardiomyopathy).

Position-related parameters recorded with LPM were compared with Vicon motion-analysis data sampled at 100 Hz.

The method of the survival analysis was applied to model the driver speed reduction time (the elapsed time to pass from the initial speed to the minimum speed during the yielding maneuver) with the use of the Weibull distribution. The model identified the <b>average</b> <b>deceleration</b> and the countermeasure condition as significant explanatory variables. The survival curves highlighted that for the colored paved markings the driver adopted longer values of the speed reduction times and then a less aggressive driver’s braking behavior. Moreover, the outcomes of the questionnaire confirmed that the colored paved markings was considered as the most effective in terms of driving aid...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} two {{parameter}} generalization for the dark energy {{equation of state}} (EOS) w_X for thawing dark energy models which includes PNGB, CPL and Algebraic thawing models as limiting cases and confront our model with the latest observational data namely SNe Ia, OHD, CMB, BOSS data. Our analysis reveals that the phantom type of thawing dark energy is favoured upto 2 σ confidence level. These results also show that thawing dark energy EOS is not unique from observational point of view. Though different thawing dark energy models are not distinguishable from each other from best-fit values (upto 2 σ C. L. s) of matter density parameter (Ω_m^ 0) and hubble parameter (H_ 0) at present epoch, best-fit plots of linear growth of matter perturbation (f) and <b>average</b> <b>deceleration</b> parameter (q_ av); the difference indeed reflects in best-fit variations of thawing dark energy EOS, model-independent geometrical diagnostics like the statefinder pair {r,s} and Om 3 parameter. We are thus led {{to the conclusion that}} unlike the standard observables (Ω_m^ 0, H_ 0, f, q_ av), the model-independent parameters (r,s,Om 3) and the variations of EOS (in terms of w_X-w_X' plots) serve as model discriminators for thawing dark energy models.

30|$|The <b>average</b> {{in service}} <b>deceleration</b> {{achieved}} with manual driving during braking of the Metrocars has been measured at 0.5  m/s 2 by previous work, {{well below the}} full service braking figure of around 1.3  m/s 2 [43]. For ATO, the London Underground Central Line {{can be used as}} a point of comparison. This uses a target deceleration of 0.75  m/s 2 when running above ground and 1.15  m/s 2 in underground sections. The full service maximum here is also around 1.3  m/s 2, and this provides an illustration of the differences in deceleration levels for manual driving and ATO referred to above. However, when the Central line ATO system was first introduced, there were significant issues with low wheel/rail adhesion levels on above-ground sections, with wheel slide under braking resulting in unacceptable levels of wheel flats and station overruns. Low adhesion conditions on the line are most commonly reported during autumn, typically due a combination of light rain and fallen leaves on the rails. When these conditions are present, the ATO target deceleration is reduced to 0.55  m/s 2, in addition to other mitigation measures such as railhead treatment [44].|$|R
40|$|Inshore reefs on Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR) {{are widely}} argued {{to be in}} decline, {{although}} recent reports suggest that some may be more resilient than traditionally assumed. Resolution of this debate requires long-term insights into past reef development and variability to provide context {{for the assessment of}} present reef condition. Long-term reef growth histories can preserve extended records of reef growth and condition, however they are rare, especially for mainland-attached fringing reefs, which are themselves uncommon on the GBR. We examined the internal structure and ecology at Bramston Reef, a mainland-attached fringing reef located in a protected bay on the central GBR. Eight reef matrix cores were collected across the reef flat. Sedimentological and palaeo-ecological analyses coupled with U–Th dating were used to develop the first reef growth history for a shore-attached fringing reef in this region. Twenty-five hard coral genera were identified in the palaeo-ecological analyses. The key reef-building genera (including Acropora, Montipora, Euphyllia, Porites and Goniopora) have contributed to reef growth since initiation and are represented in the extant coral community, despite a change in accretion 'mode' during the late Holocene. Sedimentological and stratigraphic investigations demonstrate Bramston Reef has always grown in a mud-rich setting. U–Th ages indicate that reef initiation occurred at or before 5400 yBP in a palaeo-water depth of 2 – 3 m. Bramston Reef reached sea level by 4256 yBP when sea level was approximately 1 m higher than present, after which rapid seaward progradation occurred until around 3000 yBP (~ 19 cm/yr on average). Between approximately 3000 and 1000 yBP seaward progradation of the reef flat slowed (to ~ 9. 8 cm/yr on <b>average).</b> This <b>deceleration</b> of reef growth occurred long before European settlement of the Queensland coast and was driven by natural constraints, probably associated with limited accommodation space due to late-Holocene sea-level fall. Our results demonstrate that mainland-attached reef initiation and accretion can occur in muddy inshore environments over long timeframes (centuries to millennia) ...|$|R
40|$|Drivers’ speeds were {{recorded}} on 26 configurations of the tangent-curve-tangent transition of three two-lane rural roads {{implemented in the}} CRISS (Inter-University Research Center for Road Safety) driving simulator. 856 speed profiles of each individual driver were analyzed. The deceleration and acceleration rates experienced by each driver were calculated. The values of 85 th percentile were subsequently obtained. The operating speeds on each configuration were also calculated. The mean value of the differences of speed of each driver between {{the beginning and the}} midpoint of the curve was not significantly different from zero, while that between the midpoint and the end was significantly different from zero. However, considering the low values of the differences of speed between the midpoint {{and the end of the}} curve (mean 1. 3 km/h), the simplified assumption of the current speed-profiles of speed on the circular curve constant is considered admissible. Different <b>average</b> distances of <b>deceleration</b> and acceleration were found. That underscores the correctness of assuming different values of deceleration and acceleration rate, in accordance with the more recently developed operating speed-profile model. The 85 th percentile of the deceleration and acceleration rates experienced by each driver were significantly higher than those obtained by the values of the operating speeds. Consequently, this latter methodology, used for developing the most advanced operating speed-profile model available in literature, leads to underestimating the rates effectively adopted by the drivers. Two models that predict the expected 85 th percentile of the deceleration and acceleration rates experienced by drivers were also developed...|$|R
