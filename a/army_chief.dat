5|$|The {{flight was}} {{conducted}} during coastal defense maneuvers {{held by the}} Air Corps without {{the participation of the}} United States Navy, and apparently without understanding of their purpose by the <b>Army</b> <b>Chief</b> of Staff.

5|$|On 2 February 1971, {{one week}} after the coup, Amin {{declared}} himself President of Uganda, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, <b>Army</b> <b>Chief</b> of Staff, and Chief of Air Staff. He announced that he was suspending certain provisions of the Ugandan constitution, and soon instituted an Advisory Defence Council composed of military officers with himself as the chairman. Amin placed military tribunals above the system of civil law, appointed soldiers to top government posts and parastatal agencies, and informed the newly inducted civilian cabinet ministers that they would be subject to military discipline.|$|E

5|$|On November 3, 1835, Texas {{declared}} {{itself an}} independent state, and a provisional government was formed with Henry Smith of Brazoria elected provisional governor. Austin requested to be relieved of his {{command of the}} army, and Sam Houston was named <b>army</b> <b>chief.</b> Edward Burleson was chosen as temporary commander of the troops in San Antonio. Bowie appeared before the council at some point and spoke for an hour, asking for a commission. The council refused Bowie's request, likely because of lingering animosity over his land dealings.|$|E
5|$|Powerful vested {{interests}} and corrupt commanders were, as of February 2011, the largest obstacle to reforming the army. Some newly delivered weaponry was sold by officers. The International Crisis Group {{also said that}} AMISOM's efforts at assisting in formalizing the military's structure and providing training to the estimated 8,000 SNA soldiers were problematic. Resistance continued {{to the establishment of}} an effective chain of command, logical military formations and a credible troop roster. Although General Mohamed Gelle Kahiye, the respected former <b>army</b> <b>chief,</b> attempted to instill reforms, he was marginalized and eventually dismissed.|$|E
5|$|The {{commanding}} {{officer at the}} USMA is the Superintendent. In recent years, the position of Superintendent has been held by a Lieutenant General (three star general). The 59th and current Superintendent, Lieutenant General Robert L. Caslen, Jr., took command on 17 July 2013. Earlier in his career, Caslen served as the 70th commandant of Cadets. The academy is a direct reporting unit, and as such, the Superintendent reports directly to the <b>Army</b> <b>Chief</b> of Staff (CSA).|$|E

5|$|With a {{characteristic}} flair for creating publicity, the Air Corps' General Headquarters Air Force (its combat organization) not only successfully made the interception at sea, but exploited both live radio news coverage and dramatic photographs. Although the publicity {{resulted in a}} short-term setback for Air Corps ambitions, within a year both U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and future <b>Army</b> <b>Chief</b> of Staff George C. Marshall became new proponents of long-range air power.|$|E
5|$|Word of the {{incidents}} spread, eventually reaching Patton's superior, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who ordered him to apologize to the men. Patton's actions were initially suppressed in the news until journalist Drew Pearson publicized them in the United States. While the U.S. Congress {{and the general public}} expressed both support and disdain for Patton's actions, Eisenhower and <b>Army</b> <b>Chief</b> of Staff George Marshall opted not to fire Patton as a commander. He was nonetheless sidelined from combat command for almost a year.|$|E
5|$|At Remagen the 47th Regiment {{was given}} the mission of {{guarding}} the Ludendorff Bridge over the Rhine River. Twenty five years later the 47th would once again guard this bridge during World War II. The regiment remained here until given orders to return home in mid-summer 1919. Before his departure from Europe, Middleton was summoned {{to report to the}} Third <b>Army</b> <b>Chief</b> of Staff in Koblenz. Here he was informed that he and other senior officers were being assigned to Camp Benning, Georgia to form the first faculty of the Infantry School that was being established there. Middleton sailed out of Brest in mid-July, met his wife in New York, and together they traveled to Columbus, Georgia by way of Washington, D.C. and Atlanta.|$|E

5|$|Graduation {{from the}} Army War College was {{normally}} {{followed by a}} staff posting, and on graduation in June 1933 Kenney became an assistant to Major James E. Chaney in the Plans Division of the Office of the Chief of the Air Corps, Major General Benjamin Foulois. He performed various duties, including translating an article by the Italian air power theorist Giulio Douhet into English. In 1934, he was involved with drafting legislation that granted the Air Corps {{a greater degree of}} independence. This legislation prompted the Army to create GHQ Air Force, a centralized, air force-level command headed by an aviator answering directly to the <b>Army</b> <b>Chief</b> of Staff. Lieutenant Colonel Frank M. Andrews was chosen to command it, and selected Kenney as his Assistant Chief of Staff for Plans and Training.|$|E
5|$|Heated debate arose among Westmoreland, Commandant of the Marine Corps Leonard F. Chapman, Jr. and <b>Army</b> <b>Chief</b> of Staff Harold K. Johnson. Johnson {{backed the}} Marine {{position}} {{due to his}} concern over protecting the Army's air assets from Air Force co-option. Westmoreland was so obsessed with the tactical situation that he threatened to resign if his wishes were not obeyed. As a result, on 7 March, {{for the first time}} during the Vietnam War, air operations were placed under the control of a single manager. Westmoreland insisted for several months that the entire Tet Offensive was a diversion including, famously, attacks on downtown Saigon and obsessively affirming that the true objective of the North Vietnamese was Khe Sanh.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006, Ethiopian troops entered Somalia {{to assist}} the TFG against the {{advancing}} Islamic Courts Union, initially winning the Battle of Baidoa. On 28 December 2006, the allied forces recaptured the capital from the ICU. The offensive helped the TFG solidify its rule. Ethiopian and TFG forces forced the ICU from Ras Kamboni between 7–12 January 2007. They were assisted by at least two U.S. air strikes. On 8 January 2007, {{for the first time}} since taking office, President Ahmed entered Mogadishu from Baidoa as the TFG moved its base to the national capital. President Ahmed brought his Puntland <b>army</b> <b>chief</b> with him, and Abdullahi Ali Omar became Somali chief of army on 10 February 2007.|$|E
