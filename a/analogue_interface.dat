The interface makes use of the link ports, which are standard features of general-purpose digital signal processor (DSP).

Current technologies for video processing are either based on applicationspeci®c integrated circuit (ASIC) or programmable processors specialised for video or video DSP as well as a hybrid of the above with a host computer.

Low power <b>analogue</b> <b>interfaces</b> are being replaced by IEC 61850 9 2 and IEC 61869 9 digital interfaces that use Ethernet networks for communication. These ‘process bus’ connections achieve significant cost savings by simplifying connections between switchyard and control rooms; however the in-service performance when these standards are employed is largely unknown. The performance of real-time Ethernet networks and time synchronisation was assessed using a scale model of a substation automation system. The test bed was constructed from commercially available timing and protection equipment supplied by a range of vendors. Test protocols have been developed to thoroughly evaluate the performance of Ethernet networks and network based time synchronisation. The suitability of IEEE Std 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) as a synchronising system for sampled values was tested in the steady state and under transient conditions. Similarly, the performance of hardened Ethernet switches designed for substation use was assessed under a range of network operating conditions. This paper presents test methods that use a precision Ethernet capture card to accurately measure PTP and network performance. These methods can be used for product selection and to assess ongoing system performance as substations age. Key findings on the behaviour of multi-function process bus networks are presented. System level tests were performed using a Real Time Digital Simulator and transformer protection relay with sampled value and Generic Object Oriented Substation Events (GOOSE) capability. These include the interactions between sampled values, PTP and GOOSE messages. Our research has demonstrated that several protocols can be used on a shared process bus, even with very high network loads.

40|$|Game is an {{essential}} aspect of a child's life and is a necessary activity {{for the creation of}} a gratifying and pleasant relationship towards life and the surrounding world. In general, playing with friends is an important activity at any age. Among games, an important role is played by sports practiced for recreational purpose, e. g. football, basketball, rugby, but for people with disabilities, a direct participation is often too difficult or impossible. Assistive technology has allowed or made more accessible participation to some games to users with disabilities, for example, videogames, but the gap is still very important for real sports. The idea at the base of ElGo is that a person with disabilities, in particular a child or a teenager, can live the game of football thanks to the possibility of controlling an electromechanic device having the role of a goalkeeper in a football match. Main Content. ElGo is composed by a dummy moving on an horizontal linear guide, placed near the goal line, and remotely controlled by the user standing in proximity of the field. The dummy is moved by an electrical motor operated by a motor control device and powered by rechargeable batteries, so that ElGo can be used also where no mains power system is available. The system is controlled by an electronic device, which also manages the user interface. ElGo can be operated in three modes: with only two switches (one for dummy right movement and one for left movement), with four switches (two speed grades for both directions) and with an <b>analogue</b> <b>interface</b> such as a linear potentiometer or a proportional joystick. Results. The presented device is currently developed as a prototype at the University of Pisa by a team composed of Professors, Graduates and Students of Electronic and Mechanical Engineering. The electronic subsystem has been almost completely realized, mechanical elements have been almost completely designed and the relevant procurement phase has started. Conclusion. ElGo expands the boundary of game for disabled people towards new experiences together with able-bodied persons; in this way people with disabilities will be able to participate to a very popular game such as football, not only using a videogame console but in a more physical and active way...|$|E
40|$|The {{integrity}} of the cement-bone interface {{is vital to the}} long term stability of cemented arthroplasty. Although the factors affecting the strength of the cement-bone interface are well documented the behaviour and load transfer across the interface at the trabecular level has been largely neglected. In addition, modelling of the cement-bone interface has mostly been limited to evaluation at the continuum level. In the following study, two modelling approaches have been developed for evaluation of the microstructural behaviour of the cement-bone interface. The first technique used a unit cell as a simplification of the morphology of cancellous bone. Using this method, variations in volume fraction resulting from changes in trabecular thickness and porosity size were shown to influence the resulting apparent stiffness. When cement was added to the unit cell, the stiffness became significantly greater with increasing cement penetration. The second approach used high resolution computed tomography (CT) images of the microstructure of the interface to create micro finite element (?FE) models of the interface. A cancellous bone analogue was selected and smooth surface models were created. It was shown that correlation of the volume segmented from CT images to the actual volume was vital for accurate calculation of the apparent level stiffness. The cancellous bone analogue material was then used to create analogue specimens representative of the cement-bone interface. Two non-destructive techniques, micro CT imaging and acoustic emission, were used to monitor damage evolution in the interfacial region, with the aim of validating finite element models of the interface. Initiation and progression of damage through the cement and foam was isolated and characterised by analysis of the associated AE parameters, and correlated well with the CT data. Therefore, the ability of AE as a passive tool to provide early indication of failure in situ was demonstrated. When the cement-bone <b>analogue</b> <b>interface</b> was loaded in bending, damage initiated at stress concentrations formed by irregularities in the aluminium geometry, recesses and notches formed by flow of cement into the aluminium. ?FE models of the cement-bone analogue specimens were created. Linear elastic models showed regions of high stress at the failure loci. ?FE models of specimens with differing degrees of cement interdigitation were created and it was demonstrated that the local load transfer across the interface was different for different penetration depths. The combined use of experimental and computational methods has enabled evaluation of the behaviour of the cement-bone interface at the microstructural level. Further development of the models and the use of more clinically representative loading conditions will enhance the understanding of the role of interface morphology, trabecular architecture and properties on the resulting interface strength. In addition, these methods may be combined with macroscopic scale models of prosthesis/bone constructs to evaluate factors such as stem design on the interface conditions...|$|E
