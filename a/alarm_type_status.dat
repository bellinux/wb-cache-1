40|$|Users of {{a mobile}} phone are often {{required}} to adapt its <b>alarm</b> <b>type</b> to context. While ringing tones may be obtrusive during meetings, a vibration alarm is barely noticeable on a bus. We propose setting the <b>alarm</b> <b>type</b> automatically, based on context-information {{obtained from a}} variety of lowcost sensors. Our multi-sensor board captures audio, acceleration, compass readings, temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and ambient light. Based on raw sensor data, we build five soft sensors representing context properties that are relevant for setting a suitable <b>alarm</b> <b>type.</b> In particular, we determine if the user keeps the phone close to the body, is involved in a conversation, is exposed to high background noise, is outdoors, or is physically active. Although a decision for the <b>alarm</b> <b>type</b> can be made based on the context detected, users generally have different preferences as to what <b>alarm</b> <b>type</b> to use in a given context. We therefore propose learning user preferences through reinforcement, by associating reactions like taking or hanging up an incoming call with rewards and punishments. Our experimenta...|$|R

40|$|Decision {{support for}} {{operators}} is not new, and {{much has been}} written regarding the potential usefulness of digital support systems and alarm filtering strategies. However, determining the appropriate characteristics of decision support tools is difficult, especially when alarms can vary in the manner which diagnostic information is formulated and displayed and when event scenario types are complex and numerous. When first reviewed, the advantages or disadvantages of a particular alarm approach may not be apparent to the designer or analyst. The present research focuses on the review of two particular alarm strategies, binary <b>alarm</b> <b>type</b> (BAT) and likelihood <b>alarm</b> <b>type</b> (LAT), and reviews their influence upon accuracy, bias, and trust for tasks performed at a computer workstation capable of replicating a series of control-room-like alarms.

40|$|Success of semiconductor/LCD {{industry}} {{depends on}} its yield and quality of product. For the purpose, FDC (Fault Detection and Classification) system is used to diagnose fault state in main manufacturing processes by monitoring time series data collected by equipment sensors which represent various conditions of the equipment. The data set is segmented at the start and end of each product lot processing by a trigger event module. However, in practice, segmented sensor data usually have the features of data asynchronization such as different start points, end points, and data lengths. Due to the asynchronization problem, false <b>alarm</b> (<b>type</b> I error) and missed <b>alarm</b> (<b>type</b> II error) occur frequently. In this paper, we propose a robust process fault detection system by integrating a process event detection method and a similarity measuring method based on dynamic time warping algorithm. An experiment shows that the proposed system is able to recognize abnormal condition correctly under the asynchronous data situation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- We {{describe}} a pre-processing technique for mining a telecommunication alarm log for frequent temporal patterns. The method consists in extracting relevant subsets {{from the initial}} log {{with the aim of}} discovering frequent patterns more accurately. In a first step, the <b>alarm</b> <b>types</b> presenting the same temporal behaviour are clustered with a self organizing map. Then, log areas which are rich in alarms of each cluster are regrouped in subsets which are subsequently exhaustively searched for frequent patterns. We demonstrate the efficiency of our preprocessing method through experiments on an actual alarm log from an ATM network.

We are investigating automatic recognition of this class of sounds both because of the practical applications for the hearing impaired, and also because alarm sounds are deliberately constructed to be easily heard, making them a promising target for detection in adverse circumstances. We compare two different approaches to alarm detection, one based on techniques and representations borrowed from speech recognition, and the other more specifically designed to exploit the structure of alarm sounds and minimize the influence of background interference. In this preliminary work, both approaches achieve similarly poor error rates but with different patterns in response to <b>alarm</b> <b>type</b> and background noise. 1...|$|R
