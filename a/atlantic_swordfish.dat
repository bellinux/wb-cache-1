40|$|The genetic {{population}} structure of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>swordfish</b> {{has been studied}} with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA) data {{using a variety of}} laboratory methodologies and analytical approaches. In here, we compare preliminary data for the nuclear genes ldhA and Calmodulin (Cam) from the South Atlantic against published data from other regions. Results from Cam, but not ldhA, confirm the partitioning of NW Atlantic and South <b>Atlantic</b> <b>swordfish</b> populations. The distribution Cam alleles and CR-I haplotypes is homogeneous throughout the entire South Atlantic (South of 5 °N) and comparisons with the Indian Ocean confirm the genetic differentiation of these two basins. However, the boundary that separates the North Atlantic from the South Atlantic cannot be delineated with the present data, and additional temporal-spatial sampling is necessary to resolve this issue. It {{is important to note that}} the North Atlantic has been characterized primarily using NW Atlantic and Caribbean samples, with very limited sampling coverage of the NE Atlantic. However, because mixing with the Mediterranean swordfish may occur in the NE Atlantic, it is important to delineate the area of contact between these two regions prior to comparing NE and NW Atlantic samples. Using CR-I data, we show that the mixing zone of NE Atlantic and the Mediterranean is restricted to a small zone west of Gibraltar that extends west to 10 °W.

While {{previous studies of}} genetic population structure using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA confirm two genetically distinct stocks, sampling coverage has not been uniform or representative of all areas and estimates of admixture in areas of contact have not been provided. In this study, we examined: 1) the applicability of high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) in population genetic studies of non-model organisms, 2) {{the use of nuclear}} markers in <b>Atlantic</b> <b>swordfish</b> and the methodology whereby nuclear gene variation can be quickly screened, identified, and genotyped using short-amplicon (SA) HRMA and unlabeled probe (UP) HRMA, and 3) the use of HRMA to characterize nuclear markers to study the genetic population structure of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>swordfish</b> using representative samples of the entire basin to provide an estimation of population admixture by means of Bayesian individual assignment. High resolution melting analysis (HRMA) is shown to be a highly sensitive, rapid, closed-tube genotyping method amenable to high throughput and, though until recently primarily confined to clinical studies, suitable for population studies in non-model species. Ten nuclear markers were genotyped primarily by SA- and UP-HRMA in North Atlantic (n= 419), South Atlantic (n= 296), and Mediterranean (n= 59) swordfish. Comparisons of pairwise FST, AMOVA, PCoA, and Bayesian individual assignments were congruent with previous finding of three discrete populations with comparatively low levels of estimated gene flow for a marine organism (FST = 0. 039 - 0. 126). Population admixture was identified and estimated in the Northeast Atlantic and appeared to be asymmetrical, with swordfish from the South Atlantic found among North Atlantic localities but no North Atlantic migrants identified in the South Atlantic. The Mediterranean boundary currently at the Strait of Gibraltar is found to extend west into Atlantic waters to approximately 8 ?W. Similarly, the boundary between North and South <b>Atlantic</b> <b>swordfish</b> should be revised to a line that extends north from 0 ?N 45 ?W to 25 ?N 45 ?W and from that position, as a nearly horizontal line, eastwards to the African coast.

40|$|Previous genetic {{studies of}} <b>Atlantic</b> <b>swordfish</b> (Xiphias gladius L.) {{revealed}} significant differentiation among Mediterranean, North Atlantic and South Atlantic populations using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data. However, limitations in geographic sampling coverage, {{and the use}} of single loci, precluded an accurate placement of boundaries and of estimates of admixture. In this study, we present multilocus analyses of 26 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 10 nuclear genes to estimate population differentiation and admixture based on the characterization of 774 individuals representing North Atlantic, South Atlantic, and Mediterranean swordfish populations. Pairwise FST values, AMOVA, PCoA, and Bayesian individual assignments support the differentiation of swordfish inhabiting these three basins, but not the current placement of the boundaries that separate them. Specifically, the range of the South Atlantic population extends beyond 5 ?N management boundary to 20 ?N- 25 ?N from 45 ?W. Likewise the Mediterranean population extends beyond the current management boundary at the Strait of Gibraltar to approximately 10 ?W. Further, admixture zones, characterized by asymmetric contributions of adjacent populations within samples, are confined to the Northeast Atlantic. While South Atlantic and Mediterranean migrants were identified within these Northeast Atlantic admixture zones no North Atlantic migrants were identified respectively in these two neighboring basins. Owing to both, the characterization of larger number of loci and a more ample spatial sampling coverage, it was possible to provide a finer resolution of the boundaries separating <b>Atlantic</b> <b>swordfish</b> populations than previous studies.

The levels of total omega 6 (n- 6) fatty acids ranged from 2. 3 % to 20. 2 % of total lipids, chiefly as arachidonic acid (AA, 20 : 4 n- 6). Fatty fish such as Gemfish, <b>Atlantic</b> Salmon and <b>Swordfish</b> were found to be good sources of omega- 3 fatty acid (1360, 2252 and 2571 mg/ 100 g fish respectively), while low fat fish such as Ling, Deep Sea Bream (Blue Warhou) and Blue Grenadier (0. 5, 0. 7 and 0. 7 % fat) had low levels of omega 3 fatty acid (222, 257 and 247 mg/ 100 g). Because most white table fish consumed by Australians are so low in fat they are actually a limited source of omega 3 fats.

Sailfish were the dominant billfish collected in summer surveys, and larvae were present at 37. 5 % of the stations sampled. Blue marlin and white marlin larvae were present at 25. 0 % and 4. 6 % of the stations sampled, respectively, while swordfish occurred at 17. 2 % of the stations. Areas of peak production were detected and maximum density estimates for sailfish (22. 09 larvae 1000 m− 2) were significantly higher than the three other species: blue marlin (9. 62 larvae 1000 m− 2), white marlin (5. 44 larvae 1000 m− 2), and swordfish (4. 67 larvae 1000 m− 2). The distribution and abundance of billfish and swordfish larvae varied spatially and temporally, and several environmental variables (sea surface temperature, salinity, sea surface height, distance to the Loop Current, current velocity, water depth, and Sargassum biomass) were deemed to be influential variables in generalized additive models (GAMs). Mesoscale features in the NGoM affected the distribution and abundance of billfish and swordfish larvae, with densities typically higher in frontal zones or areas proximal to the Loop Current. Habitat suitability of all four species was strongly linked to physicochemical attributes of the water masses they inhabited, and observed abundance was higher in slope waters with lower sea surface temperature and higher salinity.

40|$|The pelagic {{longline}} fishery {{in the western}} <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean targeting <b>swordfish</b> (Xiphias gladius) and tunas (Thunnus spp.) historically has a high frequency of interactions with marine mammals, particularly pilot whales (Globicephala spp.) in the Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) region.

Taking advantage of the size difference between large bycatch and relatively smaller target species, these 2 ̆ 2 weak 2 ̆ 2 hooks could be implemented as a bycatch reduction agent. To test this within the tuna fishery of the MAB, 21 sets were made using size 16 / 0 hooks, targeting yellow fin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and bigeye tuna (T. obesus) alternating strong and weak hooks. To test these hooks in a swordfish targeted area, nine sets were made using larger size 18 / 0 hooks within the Florida East Coast statistical area (FEC) and the Charleston Bump of the Southern Atlantic Bight statistical area (SAB) alternating strong and weak hooks. Size 18 / 0 strong hooks straighten at 350 lb (159 kg) of pull, while the weak straightens at 225 lb (102 kg). Results for the tuna targeted sets showed no significant reduction in total catch (a 3 ̆c 0. 05) of any target species, with weak hooks having higher trends for catch per unit effort (CPUE) for both tuna and swordfish. The only species to show {{a significant difference in}} total catch between strong and weak 16 / 0 hooks was the pelagic stingray (Pterplatytrygon violacea), with more individuals caught by the strong hook. The 18 / 0 hook sets had similar catches for all species except the target species swordfish. Swordfish CPUE trended higher for the strong hook, while also having significantly higher total catches. Seven weak hooks were retrieved straightened at haul back; one of these hooks was observed being straightened by a pilot whale at 10 m distance from the vessel...|$|R
