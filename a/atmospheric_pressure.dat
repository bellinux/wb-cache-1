5|$|A diver {{who only}} {{breathes}} gas at <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressure</b> when free-diving or snorkelling will not usually need to decompress {{but it is}} possible to get decompression sickness, or taravana, from repetitive deep free-diving with short surface intervals.|$|E
5|$|At a {{pressure}} of 55GPa (roughly 540,000 times <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressure)</b> bromine undergoes an insulator-to-metal transition. At 75GPa it changes to a face-centered orthorhombic structure. At 100GPa it changes to a body centered orthorhombic monatomic form.|$|E

5|$|Night diving {{can allow}} the diver to {{experience}} a different underwater environment, because many marine animals are nocturnal. Altitude diving, for example in mountain lakes, requires modifications to the decompression schedule because of the reduced <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of formation, high clouds {{indicated}} the presence of intense convection, and the cyclone featured an axisymmetric cloud structure, with a distinct, cloud-free eye and rainbands spiraling around the disturbance as a whole. Soon thereafter, the parent low separated from the medicane entirely and continued eastward, meandering toward the Aegean Sea and Turkey. Initially remaining stationary between Greece and Sicily with a minimum <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressure</b> of 1002mbar (29.59inHg), the newly formed system began to drift southwest-to-south in the following days, influenced by northeasterly flow incited by the initial low, now far to the east, and a high-pressure area above central and eastern Europe. The system's <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressure</b> increased throughout 15January {{due to the fact}} it was embedded within a large-scale environment, with its rising pressure due to the general prevalence of higher air pressures throughout the region, and was not a sign of deintensification.|$|E
5|$|<b>Atmospheric</b> <b>pressure</b> changes due {{to change}} of {{altitude}} {{before or after}} diving can have a significant influence on decompression risk. Diving at high altitude requires special consideration in decompression planning. Such variations in ambient pressure caused by flying or surface travel involving changes in altitude will affect decompression and should be considered during dive planning and therefore may influence a planned dive profile.|$|E
40|$|As {{a step in}} {{developing}} an understanding of plant adaptation to low <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressures,</b> we have identified genes central to the initial response of Arabidopsis to hypobaria. Exposure of plants to an atmosphere of 10 kPa compared with the sea-level pressure of 101 kPa resulted in the significant differential expression of more than 200 genes between the two treatments. Less than one-half of the genes induced by hypobaria are similarly affected by hypoxia, suggesting that response to hypobaria is unique and {{is more complex than}} an adaptation to the reduced partial pressure of oxygen inherent to hypobaric environments. In addition, the suites of genes induced by hypobaria confirm that water movement is a paramount issue at low <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressures,</b> because many of gene products intersect abscisic acid-related, drought-induced pathways. A motivational constituent of these experiments is the need to address the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's plans to include plants as integral components of advanced life support systems. The design of bioregenerative life support systems seeks to maximize productivity within structures engineered to minimize mass and resource consumption. Currently, there are severe limitations to producing Earth-orbital, lunar, or Martian plant growth facilities that contain Earth-normal <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressures</b> within light, transparent structures. However, some engineering limitations can be offset by growing plants in reduced <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressures.</b> Characterization of the hypobaric response can therefore provide data to guide systems engineering development for bioregenerative life support, as well as lead to fundamental insights into aspects of desiccation metabolism and the means by which plants monitor water relations...|$|R
40|$|Recent work on {{in-plane}} nanoscale {{field emission}} devices operating at <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressures</b> highlights {{the promise of}} these devices for high-frequency applications if challenges in reliability and robustness can be mastered. We demonstrate a novel fabrication technique using silicon on insulator substrates to reliably produce sub- 20 nanometer gaps between deposited emitter and collector metals in symmetric two-terminal field emission devices. Our emitters demonstrate repeatable, low voltage emission {{across a range of}} metals. By reducing the operating voltages through miniaturization, our devices can operate at <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressures</b> without deterioration through erosive bombardment from ionized gas atoms. Furthermore, the devices are shown to operate at temperatures as high as of 215 C in vacuum atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|Availability {{of liquid}} water {{is one of}} the major {{constraints}} for the potential Martian biosphere. Although liquid water is unstable on the surface of Mars due to low <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressures,</b> it has been suggested that liquid films of water could be present in the Martian soil. Here we explored a possibility of the liquid water formation in the extremely shallow (1 - 3 cm) subsurface layer under low <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressures</b> (0. 1 - 10 mbar) and low ("Martian") surface temperatures (approx. - 50 C- 0 C). We used a new Goddard Martian simulation chamber to demonstrate that even in the clean frozen soil with temperatures as low as - 25 C the amount of mobile water can reach several percents. We also showed that during brief periods of simulated daylight warming the shallow subsurface ice sublimates, the water vapor diffuses through porous surface layer of soil temporarily producing supersaturated conditions in the soil, which leads to the formation of additional liquid water. Our results suggest that despite cold temperatures and low <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressures,</b> Martian soil just several cm below the surface can be habitable...|$|R
5|$|Climate is the {{statistics}} of weather {{over long periods}} of time. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressure,</b> wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region {{over long periods of}} time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.|$|E
5|$|In meteorology, a cyclone is a {{large scale}} air mass that rotates around a strong center of low <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressure.</b> Cyclones are {{characterized}} by inward spiraling winds that rotate about a zone of low pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are polar vortices and extratropical cyclones of the largest scale (the synoptic scale). Warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the oldest}} pieces of tornado {{folklore}} {{is the idea that}} tornadoes do most of their damage due to the lower <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressure</b> {{at the center of a}} tornado, which causes the house to explode outward.

50|$|The zero {{reference}} in use is usually implied by context, and these words are added only when clarification is needed.

40|$|AbstractBased on {{simulation}} of one-dimensional coal and gas outburst and energy conservation principle, a mechanism on spalling lamination and a formula of the lamination characteristic length were promoted. The performance of simulations in different gas pressure conditions {{showed that the}} formula was appropriate to the test results. Before the appearance of spalling lamination, a sudden strain change occurred in failure point which may fail later. During the unloading stress wave's propagation in the coal-gas medium, coal would fail as maximum tensile stress beyond the criterion, and then spalling or crush happened. The spalling lamination was disc-shaped without friction, and cone-shaped with friction. Only when gas pressure was bigger than 10 <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressures,</b> coal crushed out. But there was no coal-gas outburst under 7 <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressures...</b>|$|R

5|$|The <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressure</b> {{decreases}} with altitude, {{and this}} {{has an effect on}} the absolute pressure of the diving environment. The most important effect is that the diver must decompress to a lower surface pressure, and this requires longer decompression for the same dive profile.|$|E
5|$|The <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressure</b> on Earth's surface averages 101.325kPa, with a {{scale height}} of about 8.5km. It has a {{composition}} of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, with trace {{amounts of water}} vapor, carbon dioxide, and other gaseous molecules. The height of the troposphere varies with latitude, ranging between 8km at the poles to 17km at the equator, with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{is caused}} by {{differences}} in the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressure.</b> When a difference in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressure</b> exists, air moves from the higher to the lower pressure area, resulting in winds of various speeds. On a rotating planet, air will also be deflected by the Coriolis effect, except exactly on the equator. Globally, the two major driving factors of large-scale wind patterns (the atmospheric circulation) are the differential heating between the equator and the poles (difference in absorption of solar energy leading to buoyancy forces) and {{the rotation of the}} planet. Outside the tropics and aloft from frictional effects of the surface, the large-scale winds tend to approach geostrophic balance. Near the Earth's surface, friction causes the wind to be slower than it would be otherwise. Surface friction also causes winds to blow more inward into low-pressure areas.|$|E

5|$|With {{a minimum}} {{alveolar}} concentration (MAC) of 0.16%, methoxyflurane {{is an extremely}} potent anesthetic agent. It is a powerful analgesic agent at well below full anesthetic concentrations. Because of its low volatility and very high boiling point (104.8°C at 1atmosphere), methoxyflurane has a low vapor pressure at ambient temperature and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressure.</b> It is therefore quite difficult to vaporize methoxyflurane using conventional anesthetic vaporizers.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax (PSP) tends {{to occur in}} a young adult without underlying lung problems, and usually causes limited symptoms. Chest pain and sometimes mild breathlessness are the usual predominant presenting features. People who are affected by PSPs are often unaware of potential danger and may wait several days before seeking medical attention. PSPs more commonly occur during changes in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressure,</b> explaining to some extent why episodes of pneumothorax may happen in clusters. It is rare for PSPs to cause tension pneumothoraces.|$|E
5|$|Another popular {{method of}} growing {{synthetic}} diamond is {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD). The growth occurs under low pressure (below <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pressure).</b> It involves feeding a mixture of gases (typically 1 to 99 methane to hydrogen) into a chamber and splitting them to chemically active radicals in a plasma ignited by microwaves, hot filament, arc discharge, welding torch or laser. This method is mostly used for coatings, but can also produce single crystals several millimeters in size (see picture).|$|E
