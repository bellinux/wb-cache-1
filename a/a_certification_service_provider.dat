It builds on the observation that the eSignature Directive has largely been unable to support an internal market for <b>certification</b> <b>service</b> <b>providers,</b> partially because it insufficiently considers the essential link between e-signatures and ancillary services. Electronic identification is one of these ancillary services. The current review of the Directive is an opportunity to remedy this issue. Â Based on this idea, this paper examines the possibility of creating a comprehensive framework for trust services, that would also include electronic identification services. Â...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Despite a legal {{framework}} being {{in place for}} several years, the market share of qualified electronic signatures is disappointingly low. Mobile Signatures provide a new and promising opportunity for the deployment of an infrastructure for qualified electronic signatures. We analyzed two possible signing approaches (server based and client based signatures) and conclude that SIM-based signatures are the most secure and convenient solution. However, using the SIM-card as a secure signature creation device (SSCD) raises new challenges, because it would contain the user’s private key {{as well as the}} subscriber identification. Combining both functions in one card raises the question who will have the control over the keys and certificates. We propose <b>a</b> protocol called <b>Certification</b> on Demand (COD) that separates <b>certification</b> <b>services</b> from subscriber identification information and allows consumers to choose their appropriate <b>certification</b> <b>services</b> and <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> based on their needs. We also present some of the constraints that still have to be addressed before qualified mobile signatures are possible. ...|$|R

Those statutes provide a satisfactory legal foundation for Romanian E-commerce, but they need to be calibrated and supplemented. Recommended changes and additions to Romanian E-commerce law include: (1) enactment of a comprehensive Electronic Transactions Law which will incorporate all laws pertinent to E-commerce, including E-contract rules; (2) recognition of the validity of the electronic form in compliance with several additional requirements of other statutes, including notarization; (3) addition of rules for electronic automated contracts and electronic carriage contracts; (4) more consumer protections for E-buyers; (5) establishment of Information Technology.
