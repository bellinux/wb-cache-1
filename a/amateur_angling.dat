50|$|Portland {{today is}} the home of a varied {{professional}} fishing fleet of approximately 60 vessels, harvesting a wide variety of sustainable, commercial species. During the austral summer (November to May), the Bonney Upwelling (part of the larger Great South Australian Coastal Upwelling System) brings nutrient-rich deep ocean water to the surface in the Portland area, supporting a rich abundance of marine life. Trawlers target deepsea finfish such as rockling, hoki, blue eye trevalla and more, while Southern rock lobster, giant crab, blacklip and greenlip abalone, arrow squid, wrasse and others are also landed in significant quantities. The industry is a significant employer and directly generates approximately $30 million in export and domestic earnings for the town with major flow-on benefits through local seafood processing (both export and domestic), transport & engineering services, fuel supplies and other ancillary industries. An abalone hatchery has been established on the shores of Portland Bay and apart from some current difficulties, is likely to be an indicator of future seafood production. Easy access to prime locations supports a flourishing <b>amateur</b> <b>angling</b> fraternity, with many locals and tourists regularly enjoying a fresh catch of King George Whiting, Snapper, Kingfish, Flathead, Morwong and in recent times, Southern bluefin tuna.|$|E
5000|$|The Best Angler ESPY Award {{has been}} {{presented}} annually since 2006 to the <b>amateur</b> or professional <b>angling</b> sport fisherman, irrespective of gender or nationality, adjudged {{to be the best}} in a given calendar year; although the award may technically be presented to an angler of any fish, in practice only bass fishermen are considered as nominees.|$|R
5000|$|Drawing {{from this}} related term, a shooter or shoot-fighter {{is not a}} wrestler with a {{reputation}} for being uncooperative but one who uses legit hooking skills as a gimmick. A prime example of this tactic is Dean Malenko, who used [...] "The Shooter" [...] as a nickname. These wrestlers often gain their skills from martial arts (Ken Shamrock, Josh Barnett), or <b>amateur</b> wrestling (Kurt <b>Angle,</b> or Dolph Ziggler). These kinds of shooters are sometimes referred to as stretchers (from their ability to use legit holds on their opponents to stretch them).|$|R
50|$|Boats take a {{long time}} to build as there are almost no right <b>angles.</b> <b>Amateurs</b> working at night or in {{weekends}} commonly take a year to build a 12-16 ft (3.6 - 5m) craft. Builders with handyman skills will find that over time their skills will increase. For amateurs, starting with a boat built on a jig (temporary wooden frame) is useful as making the jig is all about right angles and basic carpentry skills. Sailboats require about 25% more time than a dinghy type because of the need for built-in buoyancy, centreboard case, centreboard, rudder, mast, boom and a range of special fittings such as chain plates, gudgeons, blocks cleats and tracks.|$|R
