500|$|Similar {{confusion}} {{is involved in}} objections that evolution is [...] "unproven," [...] since no theory in science {{is known to be}} <b>absolutely</b> <b>true,</b> only verified by empirical evidence. This distinction is an important one in philosophy of science, {{as it relates to the}} lack of absolute certainty in all empirical claims, not just evolution. Strict proof is possible only in formal sciences such as logic and mathematics, not natural sciences (where terms such as [...] "validated" [...] or [...] "corroborated" [...] are more appropriate). Thus, to say that evolution is not proven is trivially true, but no more an indictment of evolution than calling it a [...] "theory." [...] The confusion arises in that the colloquial meaning of proof is simply [...] "compelling evidence," [...] in which case scientists would indeed consider evolution [...] "proven." ...|$|E
500|$|Kafka {{feared that}} people would find him mentally and {{physically}} repulsive.

Brod compared Kafka to Heinrich von Kleist, noting that both writers {{had the ability to}} describe a situation realistically with precise details. Brod thought Kafka {{was one of the most}} entertaining people he had met; Kafka enjoyed sharing humour with his friends, but also helped them in difficult situations with good advice. According to Brod, he was a passionate reciter, who was able to phrase his speaking as if it were music. Brod felt that two of Kafka's most distinguishing traits were [...] "absolute truthfulness" [...] (...) and [...] "precise conscientiousness" [...] (...)

500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Rick Florino of Artistdirect was very positive on the album, writing {{that the film}} [...] "hearkens back to the good old days, and the film's soundtrack is not {{only one of the}} best soundtracks this year, it's also bound to be remembered as a classic." [...] The writer praised Browning's take on [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)", writing that it [...] "adds a lush darkness and vibrant vulnerability to the song reminiscent of Portishead's Beth Gibbons but with a flair all her own." [...] Florino awarded the album four and a half stars out of five, and concluded his review, writing, [...] "This is the kind of soundtrack that needs to be listened to from front to back, and if it's any indication, the film is destined {{to be one of the}} most mind-blowing and magnificent screen event this year, perhaps even the decade." [...] Allmusic's Heather Phares reviewed the album positively, praising Browning for [...] "deliver the soundtrack’s most affecting performances". Phares concluded her review with [...] "Sucker Punch is elaborate and sometimes overwrought, but it’s <b>absolutely</b> <b>true</b> to the film’s aesthetic." [...] Billboard reviewer Phil Gallo described the soundtrack as [...] "a rush of male-targeted female power" [...] which de Vries and Bates scored with [...] "dark, eerie and violent soundscapes". Gallo found Yoav's contribution to [...] "Where Is My Mind" [...] to be [...] "the soundtrack's most tender moment". Writing for Empire, Danny Graydon highlighted Browning's songs as [...] "seductive takes", and praised both Gugino and Isaac for [...] "an exuberant version of Roxy Music’s 'Love Is The Drug'" [...] and considering Björk's collaboration [...] "magnificently reversions 'Army Of Me' with Skunk Anansie". Jon M.

They are, like Snyder's movies, stylish but curiously hollow." ...|$|E

2500|$|Thomas Aquinas {{believed}} that truth {{is to be}} accepted no matter where it is found. His doctrines draw from Greek, Roman, Jewish, philosophers. Specifically, he was a realist (i.e., he, unlike the skeptics, {{believed that}} {{the world can be}} known as it is). He largely followed Aristotelian terminology and metaphysics, and wrote comprehensive commentaries on Aristotle, often affirming Aristotle's views with independent arguments. Aquinas respectfully referred to Aristotle simply as [...] "the Philosopher". He also adhered to some neoplatonic principles, for example that [...] "it is <b>absolutely</b> <b>true</b> that there is first something which is essentially being and essentially good, which we call God, ... everything can be called good and a being, inasmuch as it participates in it by way of a certain assimilation..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although it is {{sometimes}} supposed that Ibn Taymiyyah rejected {{the very idea of}} saints, which had become a cardinal Sunni belief in the medieval period, scholarship has shown that this is not true. Indeed, while Ibn Taymiyyah did indeed reject widely-established orthodox practices associated with the veneration of saints in Islam at his time, like the visitation to their graves and the seeking of their intercession, he never rejected the actual existence of saints as such. On the contrary, he explicitly states: [...] "The miracles of saints are <b>absolutely</b> <b>true</b> and correct, by the acceptance of all Muslim scholars. And the Qur'an has pointed to it in different places, and the sayings of the Prophet have mentioned it, and whoever denies the miraculous power of saints are only people who are innovators and their followers." [...] In this particular respect, he differed little from all his contemporaries; for just as practically all of the era's scholars believed that [...] "the lives of saints and their miracles were incontestable," [...] so also did Ibn Taymiyyah.|$|E

Either Hadrian or, more probably, his successor Antoninus Pius pushed {{out from the}} Odenwald and the Danube, and marked out a new frontier roughly parallel to, but in advance of these two lines, though sometimes, as on the Taunus, coinciding with the older line. This is the frontier which is now visible and visited by the curious. It consists, {{as we see it}} today, of two distinct frontier works, one, known as the Pfahlgraben, is a palisade of stakes with a ditch and earthen mound behind it, best seen in the neighbourhood of the Saalburg but once extending from the Rhine southwards into southern Germany. The other, which begins where the earthwork stops, is a wall, though not a very formidable wall, of stone, the Teufelsmauer; it runs roughly east and west parallel to the Danube, which it finally joins at Heinheim near Regensburg.

2500|$|If {{all this}} is true, then where do the world senses come in? The early empiricists all {{stumbled}} over this point. Hume asserted that all knowledge comes from the senses, and then gave away the ballgame by excepting abstract propositions, which he called [...] "relations of ideas". These, he said, were <b>absolutely</b> <b>true</b> (although the mathematicians who thought them up, being human, might get them wrong). Mill, on the other hand, tried to deny that abstract ideas exist outside the physical world: all numbers, he said, [...] "must be numbers of something: {{there are no such}} things as numbers in the abstract". When we count to eight or add five and three we are really counting spoons or bumblebees. [...] "All things possess quantity", he said, so that propositions concerning numbers are propositions concerning [...] "all things whatever". But then in almost a contradiction of himself he went on to acknowledge that numerical and algebraic expressions are not necessarily attached to real world objects: they [...] "do not excite in our minds ideas of any things in particular". Mill's low reputation as a philosopher of logic, and the low estate of empiricism in the century and a half following him, derives from this failed attempt to link abstract thoughts to the physical world, when it may be more plausibly arguable that abstraction consists precisely of separating the thought from its physical foundations.|$|E

[...] The critics mostly praised the piece, although papers disagreed on whether or not the stage should be more subject to censorship than the press. For instance, The Manchester Guardian wrote that the satire made [...] "Many a brilliant sally at the supposed short-comings of the present government." [...] Meanwhile, Gilbert was having some trouble keeping up the pseudonym. Shirley Brooks may have thought F.

[...] The play became one of the big hits of the season, running for 142 performances until the theatre closed for summer renovations on 9 August 1873.
