40|$|Inspection of coated {{material}} is vital {{in order to}} ensure the integrity of the protective barrier. In some cases, the inspection process is {{complicated by the fact that}} the surface of the protective coating may not be accessible, thus the inspection must proceed with only access to the surface of the opposite side (this will be referred to as the inner surface). One method which can be applied in such a situation is the excitation of guided waves or Lamb waves in the {{coated material}}. Lamb waves excited from the inner surface will sense the variation in the coating conditions as well as flaws in the steel plate. Therefore for a correct and unambiguous interpretation of Lamb wave data for corrosion-related flaws, the effects of the coating and how they differ from the effects of corrosion-related flaws must be understood. To this end this paper will concentrate on the effects of the coating and its influence on dispersive characteristics of a soft layer bonded to a steel plate. By calculating the dispersion relations for a bare and <b>coated</b> steel <b>plate</b> and comparing the calculated results, unique new modes are seen to emerge in the <b>coated</b> <b>plate.</b> In addition, the <b>coated</b> <b>plate</b> is also modeled as a thin layer on a halfspace allowing a comparison between the problem of a coated halfspace and a <b>coated</b> <b>plate.</b> The comparison demonstrates that only limited information can be obtained by treating the problem as a layered halfspace.

It has been utilized by many industrialists in oil and gas sector, where most of the applications are in atmospheric condition. Organic coating could fail prematurely and result in corrosion progression from coating failure. This paper will discuss the overall framework of experiments to justify the performance of thermal arc spray <b>aluminium</b> <b>coating.</b> In this research 99. 5 % aluminium was used as the coating material in wire form of 2. 3 mm diameter using wire arc spray method. Six samples were prepared with different thickness of coating from 200 to 400 microns. Mechanical tests such as Pull-off Test and Bend Test were performed to evaluate the coating performance. The tests indicated that all samples had passed the minimum requirement with an average of 10 MPa for Pull off Test and no crack appeared in Bend Test. Hardness Test and Surface Morphology Analysis were also performed with coating thickness ranged between 350 - 400 microns to inspect and evaluate the coating properties. The hardness test showed an average value of 209. 7 HV. Surface morphology analysis using FE-SEM indicated low porosity structures and high content of oxide. Thus, from the overall results and analysis {{it was found that the}} thermal arc spray can perform coating duty effectively.

40|$|In this article, a new IR-sensing {{device is}} {{described}} for {{the examination of}} chlorinated aromatic compounds in soils. To prepare this sensing device, a 20 -mL glass vial was modified {{for use in the}} analysis of soil samples by conventional Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. In this sampling device, an <b>aluminium</b> <b>plate</b> <b>coated</b> with a hydrophobic film was placed on top of the cap of the sample vial to absorb the analytes that evaporated from the soil matrix. After this absorption process was complete, the cap was placed in an FT-IR spectrometer, and the absorbed analytes were detected in the reflection-absorption (RA) mode. To accelerate the rate of evaporation of the analytes, the soil samples were heated to various temperatures. Meanwhile, other factors, such as the moisture content, sampling time, thickness of the hydrophobic film, and the volatilities and concentrations of the analytes, were also examined to optimize the analytical conditions. The results indicated that the time required to reach equilibrium conditions was short, and evaporation/absorption could be achieved within 10 min. With a water content of 10 % (v/w) or less, the intensities of the analytical signals were increased greatly when compared with those of dry samples; when the water content was above 10 % (v/w), these intensities decreased, partially {{as a result of the}} heating efficiency. After examining the compounds that had different vapour pressures, the analytical results indicated that this method was applicable to the examination of compounds that had vapour pressures below 1. 0 Torr. Using the optimal conditions determined in this study, the detection limits for semivolatile aromatic compounds were lower than 100 ng/g, and the regression coefficients of the standard curves for compounds that had a vapour pressure lower than 1. 0 Torr were larger than 0. 99 in the concentration range of 1 - 100 mug/g...|$|R
