5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, American law {{enforcement}} officials had reports of Noriega's possible involvement with narcotics trafficking. No formal criminal investigations were begun, however, with news reports <b>attributing</b> the lack of action to factors including U.S. interest in concluding the Panama Canal treaty, the value of intelligence from Panama, and Panama's support for U.S. foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} of Curse of Enchantia was mostly positive, especially {{in regard to}} its graphics and animation.

The original edition in Latin of Balthasar Corderius (Antwerp 1634) attributes all of the Scholia to Maximus, but the authorship has been questioned with Hans Urs von Balthasar (1940, 1961) <b>attributing</b> some of the Scholia to John of Scythopolis.|$|E

Later albums included artwork by collaborating artists: Ænima and Salival featured works by Cam de Leon; Lateralus and 10,000 Days were created with the help of Alex Grey. The releases garnered positive critical reception, with a music journalist of the Associated Press <b>attributing</b> to the band a reputation for innovative album packaging.|$|E

Aside from <b>attribute</b> A1, the first branch includes two additional <b>attributes,</b> A2 and A3, and the second branch includes a self-contained sub-hierarchy which includes <b>attributes</b> A4 through A9. Three independent branches compose the sub-hierarchy: <b>attributes</b> A4, A5, A6; <b>attributes</b> A4, A7, A8; and <b>attributes</b> A4, A9.As a prerequisite <b>attribute,</b> <b>attribute</b> A1 includes the most basic arithmetic operation skills, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers. <b>Attributes</b> A2 and A3 both deal with factors. In <b>attribute</b> A2, the examinee needs to have knowledge about the property of factors. In <b>attribute</b> A3, the examinee not only requires knowledge of factoring (i.e., <b>attribute</b> A2), but also the skills of applying the rules of factoring.

5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} titles, Ninja Gaiden III received mostly positive reviews from critics. Early reviews praised the game for its plot, gameplay, and difficulty; later reviews criticized it for that plot being overly outlandish, inconsistent level designs, and the game's difficulty level, in which the North American version was intentionally made harder than the Japanese version through limited continues, stronger enemies, and omission of a password system. The Atari Lynx port, while receiving general praise for graphics and controls, received poor reception for its sound and for the inability for players to see characters and items, <b>attributing</b> it to the Lynx's small screen.|$|E
5|$|During Barry's career, he was {{credited}} with saving the lives of more than forty people, although this number has sometimes varied over the years.

After warming up the boy's body sufficiently by licking him, he moved the boy about and onto his back and carried the child back to the hospice. The child survived and was returned to his parents, although other sources say that the boy's mother died in the avalanche that trapped the boy. The Museum of Natural History in Bern disputes the legend, <b>attributing</b> it to Peter Scheitlin, an animal psychologist.|$|E

40|$|Most {{research}} on <b>attribute</b> identification in database integration {{has focused on}} integrating <b>attributes</b> using schema and summary information derived from the <b>attribute</b> values.

We propose an <b>attribute</b> identification method that employs schema and summary instance information as well as properties of <b>attributes</b> derived from their instances. Unlike other <b>attribute</b> identification methods that match only single <b>attributes,</b> our method matches <b>attribute</b> groups for integration. Because our <b>attribute</b> identification method fully explores data instances, it can identify corresponding <b>attributes</b> to be integrated even when schema information is misleading. Three experiments were performed to validate our <b>attribute</b> identification method. In the first experiment, the heuristic rules derived for <b>attribute</b> classification were evaluated on 119 <b>attributes</b> from nine public domain data sets.

5|$|The {{paintings}} show {{a famous}} incident {{from the life}} of Saint Francis of Assisi, who is shown kneeling by a rock as he receives the stigmata of the crucified Christ on the palms of his hands and soles of his feet.

This treatment of Francis is the first such to appear in northern Renaissance art. The arguments <b>attributing</b> the works to van Eyck are circumstantial and based mainly on the style and quality of the panels. A later, third version is in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, but is weaker and strays significantly in tone and design.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} {{has been the}} subject of folklore in the surrounding area for several hundred years and possibly more than a millennium. Its construction was commonly attributed to a giant known as Wade, a figure from Germanic or Norse mythology. In the 1720s the causeway was mentioned in a published text and became known outside the local area. Within a few years it became of interest to antiquarians who visited the site and exchanged commentary on its probable historicity. They interpreted the structure as a causeway across marshy ground, <b>attributing</b> its construction to the Roman military, an explanation largely unchallenged throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{works have}} shown that visual <b>attributes</b> are useful {{in a number of}} applications, such as object classification, recognition, and retrieval. However, {{predicting}} <b>attributes</b> in images with large variations still remains a challenging problem. Several approaches have been proposed for visual <b>attribute</b> classifica-tion; however, most of them assume independence among <b>attributes.</b> In fact, to predict one <b>attribute,</b> it is often useful to consider other related <b>attributes.</b> For ex-ample, a pedestrian with long hair and skirt usually imply the female <b>attribute.</b> Motivated by this, we propose a novel pedestrian <b>attribute</b> classification method which exploits interactions among different <b>attributes.</b> Firstly, each <b>attribute</b> clas-sifier is trained independently. Secondly, for each <b>attribute,</b> we also use the deci-sion scores of other <b>attribute</b> classifiers to learn the <b>attribute</b> interaction regressor. Finally, prediction of one <b>attribute</b> is achieved by a weighted combination of the independent decision score and the interaction score from other <b>attributes.</b> The proposed method is able to keep the balance of the independent decision score and interaction of other <b>attributes</b> to yield more robust classification results. Ex-perimental results on the <b>Attributed</b> Pedestrian in Surveillance (APiS 1. 0) [1] database validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for pedestrian at-tribute classification. ...|$|R
