50|$|Carbon dioxide is {{produced}} continuously as the body's cells respire, and this CO2 will accumulate rapidly if the lungs do not adequately expel it through alveolar ventilation. <b>Alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> thus {{leads to an}} increased PaCO2 (a condition called hypercapnia).

50|$|Hypoxia exists {{when there}} is a reduced amount of oxygen in the tissues of the body. Hypoxemia refers to a {{reduction}} in PO2 below the normal range, regardless of whether gas exchange is impaired in the lung, CaO2 is adequate, or tissue hypoxia exists. There are several potential physiologic mechanisms for hypoxemia, but in patients with COPD the predominant one is V/Q mismatching, with or without <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation,</b> as indicated by PaCO2. Hypoxemia caused by V/Q mismatching as seen in COPD is relatively easy to correct, so that only comparatively small amounts of supplemental oxygen (less than 3 L/min for the majority of patients) are required for LTOT. Although hypoxemia normally stimulates ventilation and produces dyspnea, these phenomena and the other symptoms and signs of hypoxia are sufficiently variable in patients with COPD as to be of limited value in patient assessment. Chronic alveolar hypoxia is the main factor leading to development of cor pulmonale—right ventricular hypertrophy with or without overt right ventricular failure—in patients with COPD. Pulmonary hypertension adversely affects survival in COPD, to an extent that parallels the degree to which resting mean pulmonary artery pressure is elevated. Although the severity of airflow obstruction as measured by FEV1 is the best correlate with overall prognosis in patients with COPD, chronic hypoxemia increases mortality and morbidity for any severity of disease. Large-scale studies of LTOT in patients with COPD have demonstrated a dose-response relationship between daily hours of oxygen use and survival. There is reason to believe that continuous, 24-hours-per-day oxygen use in appropriately selected patients would produce a survival benefit even greater than that shown in the NOTT and MRC studies.|$|E

40|$|In {{patients}} with neuromuscular disorders (NMD) and thoracic wall deformities (TWD) <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> can occur once the respiratory muscles become insufficient. Non-invasive ventilation can be started to reduce hypercapnia {{and to improve}} symptoms. Previous studies in {{patients with}} NMD and TWD showed an increased survival {{and quality of life}} after initiation of NIV. Although NIV is mostly applied to reduce <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> during the night, only very few studies have searched for the effect of NIV on {{the quantity and quality of}} sleep. One of the most typical symptoms of <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> is increased daytime sleepiness, which has a possible negative effect on physical activity. Few small studies (n< 10) have found positive effects of NIV on muscle strength and the 6 minute walking distance, but no research has been done on the effect of NIV on physical activity. In a first part we will search for the effects of NIV on the quantity and quality of sleep in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A large group of ALS patients is in follow-up at the Neuromuscular Reference Centre of the University Hospitals Leuven. If <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> occurs, most of these patients are sent on to our sleep lab to initiate NIV. By using polysomnography (objective measurement) and patient reported outcomes (subjective measurement) the effect on quantity and quality of sleep is measured. Further on, research will be performed to investigate the influence of NIV on the sympathicovagal balance and an attempt will be made to create an “ideal” protocol for titration of NIV. A second part will focus on theeffects of NIV on physical activity in patients with NMD and TWD. Physical activity will be objectively measured before and after initiation ofNIV by physical activity devices together with the measurements of physical capacity and the endurance and strength of peripheral and respiratory muscles. nrpages: 182 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to observe whether dialysis-induced <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> and arterial hypoxaemia occur during bicarbonate haemodialysis in patients receiving partial mechanical support with pressure support ventilation. Nineteen patients {{admitted to the}} medical intensive care unit requiring mechanical ventilation and haemodialysis were enrolled. Arterial blood gas, white blood cell (WBC) count, minute ventilation, respiratory rate, breathing pattern and blood pressure were measured according to the following time schedule: pre-dialysis (time 0), and at 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240 min thereafter. Results showed that, {{with the use of}} cuprammonium dialyser, the WBC count dropped immediately and reached the nadir 15 min after haemodialysis. Thereafter, it recovered and overshot the pre-dialysis values until the end of dialysis. The bicarbonate dialysate indeed resulted in rapid and significant metabolic alkalosis. However, no decrease of PaO 2 occurred throughout haemodialysis. The tidal volume, minute ventilation and breathing pattern remained stable during haemodialysis. We conclude that neither dialysis-induced <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> nor arterial hypoxaemia developed during bicarbonate dialysis in patients mechanically ventilated with the pressure support ventilation...|$|E

40|$|Why {{is it so}} {{important}} that pulmonologists are familiar with respiratory muscle assessment? Respiratory muscle weakness is associated with increased respiratory workload and reduced or interrupted (central or peripheral) neural stimulation. In healthy individuals (in whom central respiratory drive is normal), the respiratory muscle strength required in order to drive the respiratory system must be greater than the sum of the work imposed by the lungs, rib cage, and airways. (1) An imbalance between the respiratory workload and respiratory muscle strength results in progressive respiratory muscle weakness, which can progress to <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> and respiratory failure depending on its severity.

40|$|A {{syndrome}} of <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> {{has been}} identified {{in a group of}} patients with bilateral diaphragm paralysis. Eight patients were studied in whom diaphragm weakness had been suggested by paradoxical (inward) movement of the abdominal wall on inspiration, of whom seven had evidence of a generalized neuromuscular disorder. Diaphragm function was assessed quantitatively by measurement of the change in transdiaphragmatic pressure during a maximum inspiration (zlPDi). In five patients, JPDi was zero and in the others ranged from 2 - 6 cm H 2 O (normal> 25 cm H 2 O) indicating paralysis and severe weakness in the respective groups. Fluoro-scopy of the diaphragm was found to give misleading results, and the reasons for this are considered. Vital capacity ranged from 65 - 30 per cent of the predicted normal in the upright posture, typically falling by about a half in the supine posture. Alveolar hypoventila-tion was present in five patients when supine and in six when asleep, the deterioration in blood gases associated with sleep generally being much greater in these patients than in normal subjects. Respiratory rate was significantly greater than age-matched controls. The ventilatory response to CO 2 was impaired. The PCO 2 could be brought to normal levels by voluntary hyperventilation, and the unreliability of voluntary respiratory manoeuvres of this kind as indices of ventilatory reserve is emphasized. <b>Alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> was associated with disturbed sleep, morning headache and day-time fatigue.

40|$|Introduction Domiciliary {{assisted}} ventilation (DAV) may {{be undertaken}} invasively or non-invasively. Non-invasive DAV {{is used for}} patients suffering from <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> due to restrictive pathology. Invasive DAV is reserved for "indications of necessity" that is when non-invasive ventilation is contraindicated due {{to the absence of}} adequate cough and for <b>alveolar</b> <b>hypoventilation</b> leading to hypercapnoea during spontaneous ventilation. State of the art The main pathophysiological limitation to noninvasive ventilation is the interference of the glottis. In this mode the glottis imposes a variable resistance to the ventilation delivered. Its behaviour is more predictable during volume controlled than during pressure controlled ventilation. The control parameters of a volume controlled ventilator are very different from those used in invasive ventilation during which the respiratory system may be regarded as a single compartment (provided a cuffed tube bypasses the upper airway). In non-invasive DAV: mode VCM, tidal volume 13 mls kg(- 1), rate 20 cycles min(- 1), insp/exp ratio 1 / 1. 2. In invasive DAV: mode VCM, tidal volume 8 - 10 mls kg(- 1), rate 12 cycles min(- 1), insp/exp ratio depending on the pathology 1 / 2. Perspectives As non-invasive DAV is essentially delivered during sleep the parameters for each patient can be optimised during polysomnography because waking, leading to a partial glottic occlusion, interferes with the ventilation delivered. Conclusions Recent understanding of the way the glottis interferes with mechanical ventilation when delivered non-invasively should lead to a revision of earlier practices based on invasive ventilation...|$|E
