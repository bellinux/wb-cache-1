During her two {{tours of duty}} in Korean waters, she was <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>to</b> play the part of seaborne mobile artillery. In direct support to United Nations troops; or in preparation for ground actions, in interdicting Communist supply and communication routes, or in destroying supplies and troop positions, New Jersey used her 16-inch guns to fire far beyond the capacity of land artillery, moved rapidly and free from major attack from one target to another, {{and at the same}} time could be immediately available to guard aircraft carriers should they require her protection. It was on this first such mission at Wonsan that she received her only combat casualties of the Korean War. One of her men was killed and two severely wounded when she took a hit from a shore battery on her number one turret and received a near miss aft to port.|$|E

But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>to</b> talk to you about more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

25|$|Charles was a {{brilliant}} strategic general, who also was a tactical commander par excellence, able {{in the heat of}} battle to adapt his plans to his foe's forces and movement — and amazingly, to defeat them repeatedly, especially when, as at Tours, they were far superior in men and weaponry, and at Berre and Narbonne, when they were superior in numbers of fighting men. Charles had the last quality which defines genuine greatness in a military commander: he foresaw the dangers of his foes, and prepared for them with care; he used ground, time, place, and fierce loyalty of his troops to offset his foe's superior weaponry and tactics; third, he adapted, <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> <b>to</b> the enemy on the battlefield, shifting to compensate for the unforeseen and unforeseeable.|$|E

[...] "Titanic is not a film that is sucking people in with flashy hype and {{spitting}} them {{out onto the street}} feeling let down and ripped off," [...] he stated. [...] "They are returning <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>to</b> repeat an experience that is taking a 3-hour and 14-minute chunk out of their lives, and dragging others with them, so they can share the emotion." [...] Cameron emphasized people from all ages (ranging from 8 to 80) and from all backgrounds were [...] "celebrating their own essential humanity" [...] by seeing it. He described the script as earnest and straightforward, and said it intentionally [...] "incorporates universals of human experience and emotion that are timeless – and familiar because they reflect our basic emotional fabric" [...] and that the film was able to succeed in this way by dealing with archetypes. He did not see it as pandering. [...] "Turan mistakes archetype for cliche," [...] he said. [...] "I don't share his view that the best scripts are only the ones that explore the perimeter of human experience, or flashily pirouette their witty and cynical dialogue for our admiration." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Gorilla" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by most music critics. Some of them praised its musical structure, while others complained for its lack for lyrical depth. In {{a review of}} Unorthodox Jukebox, Slant Magazines Andrew Chan wrote {{that it is the}} album's highlight being the most energetic track on the album and found it [...] "most infectious bedroom anthem of the year." [...] Likewise, Lauren Kreisler from the Official Charts Company, described the song as an apparent bedroom antics. About.com critic Bill Lamb rated the song 3 out of 5 stars, praising the musicality, since the singer recaptures [...] "the musical spirit of Prince's arena sized ballad [...] "Purple Rain" [...] and [...] "the pounding keyboards and crunchy guitar will invite a live audience to sway along in time to the music". On the other hand, the [...] "erotic connection" [...] is misguided because [...] "the words about alcohol and cocaine fueled rough sex, {{it is difficult to see}} the song as truly erotic", making the lyrics [...] "tasteless" [...] and lacking concept. Official Charts Company's Lauren Kreisler found that the lyrics' concept simply [...] "baffled" [...] anyone, while ultimately described the song as [...] "intriguing (and anthemic) enough to make us listen again, and <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> <b>to</b> work it out." ...|$|E

500|$|Earth is {{the only}} known planet with seas of liquid water on its surface, {{although}} Mars possesses ice caps and similar planets in other solar systems may have oceans. It is still unclear where Earth's water came from, but, seen from space, our planet appears as a [...] "blue marble" [...] of its various forms: oceans, ice caps, clouds. Earth's [...] of sea contain about 97.2 percent of its known water and cover more than 70 percent of its surface. Another 2.15% of Earth's water is frozen, found in the sea ice covering the Arctic Ocean, the ice cap covering Antarctica and its adjacent seas, and various glaciers and surface deposits around the world. The remainder (about 0.65% of the whole) form underground reservoirs or various stages of the water cycle, containing the freshwater encountered and used by most terrestrial life: vapor in the air, the clouds it slowly forms, the rain falling from them, and the lakes and rivers spontaneously formed as its waters flow <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>to</b> the sea.

500|$|Views of Disney and {{his work}} have changed over the decades, {{and there have been}} {{polarized}} opinions. Mark Langer, in the American Dictionary of National Biography, writes that [...] "Earlier evaluations of Disney hailed him as a patriot, folk artist, and popularizer of culture. More recently, Disney has been regarded as a paradigm of American imperialism and intolerance, as well as a debaser of culture." [...] Steven Watts wrote that some denounce Disney [...] "as a cynical manipulator of cultural and commercial formulas", while PBS records that critics have censured his work because of its [...] "smooth façade of sentimentality and stubborn optimism, its feel-good re-write of American history". Although Disney's films have been highly praised, very popular and commercially successful over time, there were criticisms by reviewers. Caroline Lejeune comments in The Observer that Snow White (1937) [...] "has more faults than any earlier Disney cartoon. It is vulnerable <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>to</b> the barbed criticisms of the experts. Sometimes it is, frankly, badly drawn." [...] Robin Allen, writing for The Times, notes that Fantasia (1940) was [...] "condemned for its vulgarity and lurches into bathos", while Lejeune, reviewing Alice in Wonderland (1951), feels the film [...] "may drive lovers of Lewis Carroll to frenzy". Peter Pan (1953) was criticized in The Times as [...] "a children's classic vulgarized" [...] with [...] "Tinker Bell... a peroxided American cutie". The reviewer opined that Disney [...] "has slaughtered good Barrie and has only second-rate Disney to put in its place".|$|E

[...] Describing the overall look, the director said, [...] "The film is set in the future, but it's looking at present-day society. And as I said, there's an autobiographical element as well. I'm looking back at some of the things I liked as a child — the 1950s cars and so on. Basically, I wanted to create a different world — not a future world." ...|$|E
