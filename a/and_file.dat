5|$|COBOL's data {{structures}} influenced subsequent programming languages. Its record <b>and</b> <b>file</b> structure influenced PL/I and Pascal, and the REDEFINES clause was a predecessor to Pascal's variant records. Explicit file structure definitions {{preceded the}} development of database management systems and aggregated data was a significant advance over Fortran's arrays.|$|E
5|$|Improved {{reliability}} for on-disk structures: ReFS uses B+ trees for all on-disk structures including metadata <b>and</b> <b>file</b> data. Metadata <b>and</b> <b>file</b> data are organized into tables {{similar to a}} relational database. The file size, number of files in a folder, total volume size and number of folders in a volume are limited by 64-bit numbers; as a result ReFS supports a maximum file size of 16 exabytes, a maximum of 18.4 × 1018 folders and a maximum volume size of 1 yottabyte (with 64 KB clusters) which allows large scalability with no practical limits on file and folder size (hardware restrictions still apply). Free space is counted by a hierarchical allocator which includes three separate tables for large, medium, and small chunks. File names <b>and</b> <b>file</b> paths are each limited to a 32 KB Unicode text string.|$|E

Bell filed this lawsuit in 2003. Bell was put under heavy surveillance and rearrested for harassment and stalking of federal agents. He was charged with intimidation and stalking and was convicted and again imprisoned, this time for a decade-long sentence. Bell protested vociferously against the conduct of the trial, going so far as to file civil lawsuits against two judges, at least two prosecutors, his former probation officers, and his defense attorneys, but ultimately to no avail. He was released in December 2009, only to be rearrested in July 2010 for violating his parole conditions. Bell's parole violation hearing resulted in another sentence, and Bell was released on March 12, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the newly}} formed BJP was {{technically}} distinct from the Jana Sangh, the bulk of its rank <b>and</b> <b>file</b> were identical to its predecessor, with Vajpayee being its first president. Historian Ramachandra Guha writes that the early 1980s were marked by a wave of violence between Hindus and Muslims. The BJP initially moderated the Hindu nationalist stance of its predecessor the Jana Sangh to gain a wider appeal, emphasising its links to the Janata Party and the ideology of Gandhian Socialism. This was unsuccessful, as it won only two Lok Sabha seats in the elections of 1984. The assassination of Indira Gandhi {{a few months earlier}} resulted in a wave of support for the Congress which won a record tally of 403 seats, contributing to the low number for the BJP.|$|E
5|$|During the war, the Duke of Braganza mounted cannons, dug trenches, tended the wounded, ate {{among the}} rank <b>and</b> <b>file</b> and fought under heavy fire as men {{next to him}} were shot or blown to pieces. His cause was nearly lost until he took the risky step of {{dividing}} his forces and sending a portion to launch an amphibious attack on southern Portugal. The Algarve region fell to the expedition, which then marched north straight for Lisbon, which capitulated on 24 July. Pedro proceeded to subdue {{the remainder of the}} country, but just when the conflict looked to be winding down to a conclusion, his Spanish uncle Don Carlos, who was attempting to seize the crown of his niece Doña IsabelII, intervened. In this wider conflict that engulfed the entire Iberian Peninsula, the First Carlist War, the Duke of Braganza allied with liberal Spanish armies loyal to IsabelII and defeated both MiguelI and Carlos. A peace accord was reached on 26 May 1834.|$|E

5|$|Godley {{continued}} as divisional commander {{for most of}} the campaign at Gallipoli. Of tall stature, he made constant tours of the front line amidst jokes that the communication trenches needed to be dug deeply to allow for his height. On one visit to Quinn's Post on 7 May, he personally directed troop deployments to counter a potential Turkish counterattack. Despite his inspections, his reputation amongst the rank <b>and</b> <b>file</b> of the division did not improve. Nor was his co-ordination of offensive operations sound; during the August offensive, his lack of oversight allowed one of his brigade commanders, Brigadier General Francis Johnston, a British Army officer on secondment to the NZEF, to vacillate over deployment of reinforcements. On the morning of 8 August, the Wellington Infantry Battalion was in tenuous possession of Chunuk Bair but required support to consolidate its position. Johnstone did not order his reinforcements forward until later that day. Crucial momentum was lost and Chunuk Bair was later recaptured by the Turks.|$|E
5|$|In April 1979, McCain met Cindy Lou Hensley, {{a teacher}} from Phoenix, Arizona, whose father had founded a large beer distributorship. They began dating, and he urged his wife Carol to grant him a divorce, {{which she did}} in February 1980; the uncontested divorce took effect in April 1980. The {{settlement}} included two houses, and financial support for her ongoing medical treatments due to her 1969 car accident; they would remain on good terms. McCain and Hensley were married on May 17, 1980, with Senators William Cohen and Gary Hart attending as groomsmen. McCain's children did not attend, and several years would pass before they reconciled. John and Cindy McCain entered into a prenuptial agreement that kept most of her family's assets under her name; they would always keep their finances apart <b>and</b> <b>file</b> separate income tax returns.|$|E
5|$|On the Coalition side, Mack {{was given}} {{much of the}} credit for Coburg's triumph. Blamed for the defeat, Miranda {{traveled}} to Paris to intrigue against Dumouriez. The Austro-Dutch reported losses of 97 officers, 2,762 rank <b>and</b> <b>file</b> and 779 horses. The French lost 4,000 killed and wounded, plus 1,000 men and 30 artillery pieces captured. General of Brigade Georges Guiscard de Bar was killed and four generals were wounded. Another source estimated Austrian losses as 2,600 killed and wounded and 400 missing while French casualties were 3,000 killed and wounded plus 1,000 missing or prisoners. Immediately after the battle, about 6,000 French volunteers deserted the colors and went home. Three days later, Dumouriez's army only numbered about 20,000 troops as the men deserted in hundreds. On 23 March there was a clash at Pellenberg where Coburg with 38,000 soldiers defeated Dumouriez with 22,000. The Austrians sustained 900 casualties while inflicting 2,000 on the French.|$|E

5|$|Opposition {{initially}} {{came from}} Pennsylvania's House of Representatives protesting the tax. William Maclay had noted {{that not even}} the Pennsylvanian legislators {{had been able to}} enforce excise taxes in the western regions of the state. Hamilton was aware of the potential difficulties and proposed inspectors the ability to search buildings that distillers were designated to store their spirits, and would be able to search suspected illegal storage facilities to confiscate contraband with a warrant. Although the inspectors were not allowed to search houses and warehouses, they were to visit twice a day <b>and</b> <b>file</b> weekly reports in extensive detail. Hamilton cautioned against expedited judicial means, and favored a jury trial with potential offenders. As soon as 1791 locals began to shun or threaten inspectors, as they felt the inspection methods were intrusive. Inspectors were also tarred and feathered, blindfolded, and whipped. Hamilton had attempted to appease the opposition with lowered tax rates, but it did not suffice.|$|E

The ability to analyze general linear models was also added as was the FORMAT procedure, which allowed developers to customize the appearance of data. In 1979, SAS 79 added support for the CMS operating system and introduced the DATASETS procedure. Three years later, SAS 82 introduced an early macro language and the APPEND procedure.|$|E
