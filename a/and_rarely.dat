5|$|Harmless to humans, {{the tiger}} {{catshark}} is caught incidentally by bottom trawlers, recreational anglers, <b>and</b> <b>rarely</b> squid fishers. Though edible, {{it is not}} a valued catch and is usually discarded. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient data to assess its conservation status.|$|E
5|$|In flight, {{the white}} {{lining of the}} underwings {{can be seen in}} {{contrast}} to the blackish underbody and upperside. The purple speculum lacks white bands at the front and rear, <b>and</b> <b>rarely</b> has a white trailing edge. A dark crescent is visible on the median underwing primary coverts.|$|E
5|$|Psychosocial {{interventions}} {{are used as}} an adjunct to pharmaceutical treatment and can be classified within behaviour-, emotion-, cognition- or stimulation-oriented approaches.

5|$|The Silverthrone Caldera is very remote <b>and</b> <b>rarely</b> visited or {{studied by}} geoscientists, such as volcanologists.

5|$|After resigning {{from the}} presidency, Suharto reclused {{himself in his}} family {{compound}} in the Menteng area of Jakarta, protected by soldiers <b>and</b> <b>rarely</b> making public appearances. Suharto's family {{spend much of their}} time fending-off corruption investigations. However, Suharto himself was protected from serious prosecution by politicians who owed their positions to the former president, as indicated in the leaked telephone conversation between President Habibie and attorney-general Andi Muhammad Ghalib in February 1999.|$|E
5|$|Although a professional—captains at {{the time}} were almost {{exclusively}} amateurs—the respect in which Hobbs was held meant that he was accepted as a captain. Many, but not all, critics considered him a competent tactician and leader. He regularly led the Players team against the Gentlemen and sometimes at Surrey in the absence of Percy Fender, but he was a reluctant captain. He disliked the responsibility and decision-making of leadership, <b>and</b> <b>rarely</b> even offered tactical advice.|$|E

5|$|As {{with most}} breeds of dog, the Russian Toy can suffer from patellar luxation, {{which is where}} the knee cap slips out of place when the knee bends as the groove that {{normally}} holds it in place is too shallow. It is usually an inherited defect, which occurs during the development of the foetus <b>and</b> <b>rarely</b> by trauma.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, an {{energetic}} movement arose, centered in Greenwich Village, that sought to overturn bans on free speech.Kersch, Kenneth Ira, Freedom of Speech: Rights and Liberties under the Law, ABC-CLIO, 2003, pp. 109–110. Supported by radicals, feminists, anarchists, and atheists such as Ezra Heywood, Moses Harman, D. M. Bennett, and Emma Goldman, these activists regularly battled anti-obscenity laws and, later, the government's effort to suppress speech critical of involvement in World War I. Prior to 1914, the free speech movement focused on politics, <b>and</b> <b>rarely</b> addressed contraception.|$|E
5|$|C. b. banksii {{is found}} in Queensland <b>and,</b> <b>rarely,</b> in far {{northern}} New South Wales; {{it is the largest}} subspecies by overall body size and has a moderate-sized bill. It merges with subspecies macrorhynchus around the Gulf of Carpentaria. It has disappeared from much of its former range in northern New South Wales and southeast Queensland.|$|E

5|$|Fowler had injury {{problems}} {{at the start of}} the 2005–06 season <b>and</b> <b>rarely</b> featured when fit, making just two substitute appearances in the first four months of the season. His first start of the season came against Scunthorpe United in the FA Cup on 7 January 2006, in which he scored a hat-trick. The following week he scored Manchester City's third goal in their 3–1 win against local rivals Manchester United after coming on as substitute. However, Fowler made only one more appearance for Manchester City before returning to Liverpool on a free transfer.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Magnusson {{established}} {{the use of}} stem cells from bone marrow with the first surgical debridement of an OCD lesion. These cells typically differentiate into fibrocartilage <b>and</b> <b>rarely</b> form hyaline cartilage. While small lesions can be resurfaced using this form of surgery, the repair tissue tends to have less strength than normal hyaline cartilage and must be protected for 6 to 12 months. Results for large lesions tend to diminish over time; this {{can be attributed to}} the decreased resilience and poor wear characteristics of the fibrocartilage.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, {{three months}} after her husband {{declared}} his presidential candidacy, Obama reduced her professional responsibilities by 80 percent to support his presidential campaign. Early in the campaign, she had limited involvement in which she traveled to political events only {{two days a week}} <b>and</b> <b>rarely</b> traveled overnight; by early February 2008 her participation had increased significantly, attending thirty-three events in eight days. She made several campaign appearances with Oprah Winfrey. She wrote her own stump speeches for her husband's presidential campaign and generally spoke without notes.|$|E

5|$|Killer {{whales are}} very {{sophisticated}} and effective predators of marine mammals. Thirty-two cetacean {{species have been}} recorded as prey, from observing orcas' feeding activity, examining the stomach contents of dead orcas, and seeing scars on the bodies of surviving prey animals. Groups even attack larger cetaceans such as minke whales, gray whales, <b>and</b> <b>rarely</b> sperm whales or blue whales.|$|E
5|$|Most of the three-mile (5km) {{stretch of}} river that had {{previously}} been closed was reopened without restriction, although a patrol remained in place to enforce a safety zone. The river restrictions delayed one outgoing vessel and two incoming ones. There was also a minor oil spill originating from equipment at the refinery's unoccupied <b>and</b> <b>rarely</b> used dock.|$|E
5|$|Network {{forensics}} {{is concerned}} with the monitoring and analysis of computer network traffic, both local and WAN/internet, for the purposes of information gathering, evidence collection, or intrusion detection. Traffic is usually intercepted at the packet level, and either stored for later analysis or filtered in real-time. Unlike other areas of digital forensics network data is often volatile <b>and</b> <b>rarely</b> logged, making the discipline often reactionary.|$|E

5|$|Occasionally, Labradors will exhibit {{small amounts}} of white fur on their chest, paws, or tail, <b>and</b> <b>rarely</b> a {{purebred}} Lab will exhibit brindling stripes or tan points similar to a Rottweiler. These markings are a disqualification for show dogs but {{do not have any}} bearing on the dog's temperament or ability to be a good working or pet dog.|$|E
5|$|Once {{regarded}} as plants constituting the class Schizomycetes, bacteria are now classified as prokaryotes. Unlike cells {{of animals and}} other eukaryotes, bacterial cells do not contain a nucleus <b>and</b> <b>rarely</b> harbour membrane-bound organelles. Although the term bacteria traditionally included all prokaryotes, the scientific classification changed after the discovery in the 1990s that prokaryotes consist of two very different groups of organisms that evolved from an ancient common ancestor. These evolutionary domains are called Bacteria and Archaea.|$|E
5|$|Rhodium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Rh and atomic number 45. It is a rare, silvery-white, hard, corrosion resistant and chemically inert transition metal. It is a noble metal {{and a member}} of the platinum group. It has only one naturally occurring isotope, 103Rh. Naturally occurring rhodium is usually found as the free metal, alloyed with similar metals, <b>and</b> <b>rarely</b> as {{a chemical}} compound in minerals such as bowieite and rhodplumsite. It is one of the rarest and most valuable precious metals.|$|E
