5|$|A unique {{feature of}} Murder on the Orient Express is Poirot, {{who serves as}} a hint system for the {{duration}} of the game. The player can access Poirot <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> game, and can receive hints to help them proceed. The game has two difficulty levels, and the player can determine which one they prefer to play at soon after the murder occurs. Poirot challenges the player, allowing them to choose to either readily accept help from him and allow him to guide the player through the game, or alternatively try to outsmart the famous sleuth by solving the mystery with obscure, and in some cases nonexistent hints. If the player has trouble once they have chosen the more difficult setting, Poirot will gradually become more forthcoming with information.|$|E

He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit.

5|$|The {{epaulette}} shark is an opportunistic predator of benthic crustaceans, worms, and small bony fish. Off Heron Island, over 90% of the {{epaulette shark}}'s diet consists of polychaete worms and crabs, with juveniles taking mostly {{the former and}} adults mostly the latter. It hunts most actively at dawn and dusk, though feeding can occur <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> day. This shark relies mainly on its olfactory and electroreceptive senses to locate hidden prey. It is capable of sucking prey into its mouth by expanding its muscular buccal cavity. While searching for food, the epaulette shark sometimes turns over debris with its snout or thrusts its head into the sand, swallowing food items while expelling the sand grains through its gill slits. Unlike most sharks, the epaulette shark may chew its food for up to 510 minutes. Its teeth can be depressed to form a flat surface for crushing hard-shelled prey.|$|E
5|$|Similar to Capcom's various Street Fighter titles, X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a 2D {{fighting}} game {{in which}} players control various characters to engage in one-on-one combat, attempting to knock out the opponent by depleting their health. It is the first formal installment in the Marvel vs. Capcom series and features dual-character selection and tag team battles. Instead of the typical best-of-three round format, matches consist of a single round. Players select two characters {{at the beginning of}} a match, each sporting their own life gauge. Players control one character at a time, while the other awaits off-screen. The starting character can tag in the off-screen character <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> fight. The dormant character will also slowly recover a portion of their vitality while the current character is fighting. If one character loses all of their vitality, then the tag partner will automatically come into play. The match continues until both characters on either team are defeated. If the timer runs out before either team is knocked out, then the player with the most remaining health is declared the winner.|$|E

5|$|The Final Fantasy {{series and}} several {{specific}} games within {{it have been}} credited for introducing and popularizing many concepts that are today widely used in console RPGs. The original title is often cited {{as one of the}} most influential early console RPGs, and played a major role in legitimizing and popularizing the genre. Many console RPGs featured one-on-one battles against monsters from a first-person perspective. Final Fantasy introduced a side view perspective with groups of monsters against a group of characters that has been frequently used. It also introduced an early evolving class change system, as well as different methods of transportation, including a ship, canoe, and flying airship. Final FantasyII was the first sequel in the industry to omit characters and locations from the previous title. It also introduced an activity-based progression system, which has been used in later RPG series such as SaGa, Grandia, and The Elder Scrolls. Final Fantasy III introduced the job system, a character progression engine allowing the player to change character classes, as well as acquire new and advanced classes and combine class abilities, <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> game. Final Fantasy IV is considered a milestone for the genre, introducing a dramatic storyline with a strong emphasis on character development and personal relationships. Final FantasyVII is credited as having the largest industry impact of the series, and with allowing console role-playing games to gain mass-market appeal.|$|E
