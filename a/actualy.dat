Cooling effect of teeth by rotation is affected by gear operating position (driver or follower) and combination of gear materials. 4.

We also show that, under some simple and intuitive hypothesis, the exit probability must obey the inequality, ρ^q/ρ^q + (1 -ρ) ≤ E(ρ) ≤ρ/ρ + (1 -ρ) ^q, in the infinite size limit. We believe this settles in the negative the suggestion made (2011 EPL 95 48005) that this result would be a finite size effect, with the exit probability <b>actualy</b> being a step function.

FPGA components have recently become very popular and offer important advantages for video-processing. One {{of them is the}} ability of partial functions to work independently.

The disadvantage of the DSP solution is basically sequential computation, because every instruction cause a delay. <b>Actualy</b> the more complicated the slower computation. The speed of the FPGA solution is limited by the maximum frequency and time characteristics of FPGA (eg. setup time, hold time, logical delay etc), which basically limits every integrated circuit.
