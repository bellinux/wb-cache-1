5|$|Five {{weeks after}} Homer made his pledge to behave, Marge realizes {{that she is}} bored by all the sudden peace and quiet. The {{demolition}} derby form flies into her hand, and she decides {{to give it a}} try. When she leaves, Homer wakes up and finds Marge is gone <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> demolition derby form, so he heads off to the derby with the kids to stop her. Although Marge initially enjoys the demolition derby, things soon get too dangerous for her. Homer has no idea how to save her, as he has given up being reckless. Bart comes up with an idea and calls for a beer can from a vendor. Homer then drinks the beer and rescues Marge (in a style similar to Popeye), who makes him promise not to make her the live wire in the family.|$|E
5|$|These {{fundamental}} rights help {{not only in}} protection but also the prevention of gross violations of human rights. They emphasise on the fundamental unity of India by guaranteeing to all citizens the access {{and use of the}} same facilities, irrespective of background. Some {{fundamental rights}} apply for persons of any nationality whereas others are available only to the citizens of India. The right to life and personal liberty is available to all people <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> right to freedom of religion. On the other hand, freedoms of speech and expression and freedom to reside and settle in any part of the country are reserved to citizens alone, including non-resident Indian citizens. The right to equality in matters of public employment cannot be conferred to overseas citizens of India.|$|E
5|$|The {{record for}} most games played for the club is held by Bob Morton, who made 562 {{appearances}} between 1946 and 1964. Gordon Turner scored 276 goals during his Luton Town career, and is the club's record goalscorer. Mal Donaghy made 58 appearances for Northern Ireland <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Luton Town player who has gained the most caps while with the club. The highest transfer fee paid by the club is the £850,000 paid to Odense Boldklub for Lars Elstrup in 1989, and the highest fees received are the £3,000,000 paid by West Bromwich Albion and Birmingham City for Curtis Davies and Rowan Vine in 2005 and 2007 respectively. The highest attendance recorded at Kenilworth Road was 30,069 for the visit of Blackpool in 1959. One Football League record is held by a Luton Town player—the 10 goals scored by forward Joe Payne in 1936 against Bristol Rovers is the most scored in any Football League match by a single player.|$|E

25|$|The Polar Museum, Polarmuseet, {{situated}} in a wharf house from 1837, presents Tromsø's past as a centre for Arctic hunting and starting point for Arctic expeditions.

Northern Europe's oldest cinema still in use, Verdensteatret, was built in 1915–16. The cinema has large wall paintings, made by the local artist Sverre Mack in 1921, which picture scenes from Norwegian folk lore and fairy tales.|$|E
25|$|The gas {{centrifuge}} process uses {{a large number}} of rotating cylinders in series and parallel formations. Each cylinder's rotation creates a strong centripetal force so that the heavier gas molecules containing 238U move tangentially toward the outside of the cylinder and the lighter gas molecules rich in 235U collect closer to the center. It requires much less energy to achieve the same separation than the older gaseous diffusion process, which it has largely replaced <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> current method of choice and is termed second generation. It has a separation factor per stage of 1.3 relative to gaseous diffusion of 1.005, which translates to about one-fiftieth of the energy requirements. Gas centrifuge techniques produce about 54% of the world's enriched uranium.|$|E

25|$|Though {{the film}} was quite {{faithful}} to the novel, even in script, {{there were a few}} changes. The Death of Rats is reduced to a one-scene cameo in the film where it reaps the soul of a mouse caught in a trap on Hogswatchnight, and then watches Death deliver presents, whereas in the novel it appears much more often with Quoth the Raven. The invasion of the tooth castle is covered in more detail in the movie, as is the gathering and controlling of the teeth. The annihilation of two of Teatime's associates were removed; thus, instead of Sideney being caught in the playground of his old elementary school (with curls), he was killed by the Scissor Man. The Cheerful Fairy and the Towel Wasp are both removed, along with any mention of the Money Bag Goblin by the Dean. Mention of Bibulous, the opposite brother of Bilious, is removed, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Hangover Imp that is pounding Bilious' head in the scene where Susan meets him. Medium Dave and Banjo's surname in the novel is 'Lilywhite', not 'Cropper'.|$|E
25|$|Another {{cause of}} {{delirium}} tremens is abrupt stopping of tranquilizer drugs of the barbiturate or benzodiazepine classes {{in a person}} with a relatively strong addiction to them. Because these tranquilizers' primary pharmacological and physiological effects stem from their manipulation of the GABA chemical and transmitter somatic system, the same neurotransmitter system affected by alcohol, delirium tremens can occur upon abrupt decrease of dosage in those who are heavily dependent. These DTs are much the same as those caused by alcohol <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> attendant withdrawal syndrome of which they are a manifestation. That is the primary reason benzodiazepines are such an effective treatment for DTs, despite also being the cause of them in many cases. Because ethanol and tranquilizers such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines function as positive allosteric modulators at GABAA receptors, the brain, in its desire to equalize an unbalanced chemical system, triggers the abrupt stopping of the production of endogenous GABA. This decrease becomes more and more marked as the addiction becomes stronger and as higher doses are needed to cause intoxication. In addition to having sedative properties, GABA is an immensely important regulatory neurotransmitter that controls the heart rate, blood pressure, and seizure threshold among myriad other important autonomic nervous subsystems.|$|E

500|$|The precise authorship of the {{aforementioned}} document is unclear, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> origin of {{the composition of the}} Junta. Saavedra said in his memoirs that it was [...] "the people", without being more precise. As he protested being appointed president, he could not be part of the negotiations (Manuel Belgrano and Mariano Moreno, other members, are reported to have been appointed without their consent as well). It could not have been the Regiments of Patricians either: the Junta was not a military junta (only two of nine members were military), and the Regiment would not have appointed Moreno, whose rivalry with Saavedra was known. A common accepted theory considers it to be a balance between Carlotists and Alzaguists.|$|E
500|$|The {{status of}} Foothills Stadium, {{formerly}} known as Burns Stadium, was a consistent story throughout the Cannons history.

[...] Council ultimately voted to support Parker, agreeing to a seven-year lease and $1.5 million to renovate Foothills, one of the PCL's conditions on approving the relocation. [...] In the Cannons early years, Foothills {{was regarded as a}} park with good atmosphere.

500|$|The {{reviewer}} from The Times said [...] "All {{the devices}} are infinitely sophisticated, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> film: {{the tradition of}} self-mockery continues, though at times it over-reaches itself", also saying that [...] "It is the mixture as before, only more so: it is superb hokum." [...] Connery's acting efforts were overlooked by this reviewer, who did say: [...] "There is some excellent bit-part playing by Mr. Bernard Lee and Mr. Harold Sakata: Mr. Gert Fröbe is astonishingly well cast in the difficult part of Goldfinger." [...] Donald Zec, writing for the Daily Mirror said of the film that [...] "Ken Adam's set designs are brilliant; the direction of Guy Hamilton tautly exciting; Connery is better than ever, and the titles superimposed on the gleaming body of the girl in gold are inspired." ...|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on November 11, 1910. The film was originally planned to be released on November 4, but it was delayed and some advertisements and later listings for the film give the erroneous date. The film received negative reviews in trade publications from even those which typically praised even the weaker productions. Though it was not well-received, the production was not criticized as sharply as Avenged had been. Walton of The Moving Picture News stated that the film was [...] " [...] very feeble echo on Anthony Hope. The throne room staging is ridiculous <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> resolution. The flag-waving business is feebly melodramatic. Princes, etc. don't sit on that sort of chair. I'm an admirer of Thanhouser, but this thing is straight, plain punk. In Europe it will be received as a Yankee joke." [...] The reviewer for The Moving Picture World was decidedly neutral, highlighting only the novelty of the plot and refraining from any criticism or praise of {{the merits of the}} production. The New York Dramatic Mirror was negative, but not scathing. The reviewer stated, [...] "The narrative is very entertaining - or could be made so, if the producer had cared to trouble himself about details. In its present crude form, its wild impossibility rather grates upon a spectator, because every scene in the film has some inconsistency. At least, it was worth doing well. Unfortunately, neither the acting nor the mounting has any particular merit." ...|$|E
