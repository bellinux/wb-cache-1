40|$|The {{security}} of the standard TCG architecture depends on whether the values in the PCRs match the actual platform configuration. However, this design admits potential for time-of-check time-of-use vulnerabilities: a PCR reflects the state of code and data when it was measured, not when the TPM uses a credential or signs an attestation based on that measurement. We demonstrate how an attacker with sufficient privileges can compromise the integrity of a TPM-protected system by modifying critical loaded code and static data after measurement has taken place. To solve this problem, we explore using the MMU and the TPM in concert to provide a memory event trapping framework, inwhich trap handlers perform TPM operations {{to enforce a security}} policy. Our framework proposal includes modifying the MMU to support selective memory immutability and generate higher granularity memory <b>access</b> <b>traps.</b> To substantiate our ideas, we designed and implemented a software prototype system employing the monitoring capabilities of the Xen virtual machine monitor...|$|R
40|$|Binary Translation (BT) {{has been}} {{commonly}} used to migrate application software across Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs). Some architectures, such as X 86, allow Misaligned Data Accesses (MDAs), while most modern architectures require natural data alignments. In a binary translation system, where the source ISA allows MDA and the target ISA does not, memory operations must be carefully translated. Naive translation may cause frequent misaligned data <b>access</b> <b>traps</b> to occur at runtime on the target machine and severely slow down the migrated application. This article evaluates different approaches in handling MDA in a binary translation system including how to identify MDA candidates and how to translate such memory instructions. This article also proposes some new mechanisms to more effectively deal with MDAs. Extensive measurements based on SPEC CPU 2000 and CPU 2006 benchmarks show that the proposed approaches are more effective than existing methods and getting close to the performance upper bound of MDA handling.

40|$|Compensated Penning traps with {{cylindrical}} {{ring and}} compensation electrodes and flat endcaps are considered as alternatives to high precision traps with hyperbolic ring and endcap electrodes. Cylindrical and flat electrodes {{can be more}} easily and precisely con-structed, especially for the very small traps which are desirable for ion trapping. They are easily studied since Laplace’s equation can be solved by a series expansion which is discussed in most electricity and magnetism textbooks. A central new-result is that a judicious choice of the height-to-diameter ratio for a cylindrical trap makes the axial oscillation frequency of a trapped particle independent of adjustments in the compensation potential, just as has been recently proposed for hyperbolic traps. Other properties of such orthogonalized cylindrical traps appear to be adequate for particle trapping so that properly designed cylindrical traps are promising alternatives for high precision work, ready for laboratory testing. Whether or not cylindrical traps {{will be able to}} replace hyperbolic traps entirely for the highest precision work, a major point of this paper is that orthogonalized traps can be built with any reasonable electrode geometry. Special <b>access</b> <b>traps</b> with orthogonalized anharmonicity com-pensation are thus completely feasible, though numerical calculations will be generally required for their design. 1...|$|R

40|$|The ultrafast photoinjection and {{subsequent}} relaxation {{steps of the}} indoline dye D 149 were investigated in detail for a mesoporous electrodeposited ZnO thin film and compared with experiments on sintered TiO 2 and ZrO 2 thin films, all in contact with air, using pump–supercontinuum probe (PSCP) transient absorption spectroscopy in the range 370 – 770 nm. D 149 efficiently injects electrons into the ZnO surface with time constants from ≤ 70 fs (time-resolution-limited) up to 250 fs, without the presence of slower components. Subsequent spectral dynamics with a time constant of 20 ps and no accompanying change in the oscillator strength are assigned to a transient Stark shift of the electronic absorption spectrum of D 149 molecules in the electronic ground state due to the local electric field exerted by the D 149 ˙+ radical cations and conduction band electrons in ZnO. This interpretation {{is consistent with the}} shape of the relaxed PSCP spectrum at long times, which resembles the first derivative of the inverted steady-state absorption spectrum of D 149. In addition, steady-state difference absorption spectra of D 149 ˙+ in solution from spectroelectrochemistry display a bleach band with distinctly different position, because no first-order Stark effect is present in that case. Interference features in the PSCP spectra probably arise from a change of the refractive index of ZnO caused by the injected electrons. The 20 ps component in the PSCP spectra is likely a manifestation of the transition from an initially formed bound D 149 ˙+–electron complex to isolated D 149 ˙+ and mobile electrons in the ZnO conduction band (which changes the external electric field experienced by D 149) and possibly also reorientational motion of D 149 molecules in response to the electric field. We identify additional spectral dynamics on a similar timescale, arising from vibrational relaxation of D 149 ˙+ by interactions with ZnO. TiO 2 exhibits similar dynamics to ZnO. In the case of ZrO 2, electron injection <b>accesses</b> <b>trap</b> states, which exhibit a substantial probability for charge recombination. No Stark shift is observed in this case. In addition, the spectroelectrochemical experiments for D 149 ˙+ in dichloromethane and acetonitrile, which cover the spectral range up to 2000 nm, provide for the first time access to its complete D 0 → D 1 absorption band, with the peak located at 1250 and 1055 nm, respectively.
