25|$|In 1867 Pierrepont {{conducted}} {{the case for}} the government against John H. Surratt, indicted as an accomplice in the murder of President Lincoln. Surratt, a former Confederate spy, was the last person to be tried by a U.S. Military commission in the case of Lincoln's assassination. After Lincoln's assassination, Surratt fled the United States to Montreal, Liverpool, Rome, and was finally caught in Egypt on December 2, 1866, where he was indicted and returned to the United States to face U.S. military trial. The trial opened on June 10, 1867 under Judge George P. Fisher and held immense public interest in the United States. Pierrepont argued that Surratt was involved in the conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. Government and involved with the assassination of Abraham Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth. Pierrepont argued that the military trial was suited for Surratt's case and quoted Bible verses that he viewed supported government was created by God {{for the express purpose of}} finding the guilty. Pierrepont argued that because Surratt had assumed an <b>alias</b> <b>name,</b> John Harrison, in staying at a hotel, and had fled the country that this proved his guilt. The trial lasted until August 10, 1867 and ended with the jury unable to make any decision after a seventy-hour deliberation. As a result of the hung jury, Judge Fisher set Surratt free.|$|E

Additionally, Jim Ryan and Bill Danch contributed as head writers to the series, while Ray Ellis (under the <b>alias</b> <b>name</b> Yvette Blais) and Jeff Michael composed the opening theme music for the show. Since the series' title and story were a play on Thurber's short story without the permission of his estate, his wife Helen Thurber {{filed a lawsuit against}} Filmation in 1975. She cited that the company [...] "debas and distort" [...] her late husband's story. Due to the controversy, Filmation ultimately settled with Thurber and changed the title to The New Adventures of Waldo Kitty in syndication.|$|E

30|$|The {{application}} {{presented in}} this paper is focussing on stereoscopic 3 D live broadcasting in the public cloud combined with secure transmission of video as an aliased stream with optional encryption. A stream represented by an <b>aliased</b> <b>name</b> prevents replaying content on several clients.

50|$|In computing, {{aliasing}} {{describes a}} situation in which a data location in memory can be accessed through different symbolic names in the program. Thus, modifying the data through one name implicitly modifies the values associated with all <b>aliased</b> <b>names,</b> which may not be expected by the programmer. As a result, aliasing makes it particularly difficult to understand, analyze and optimize programs. Aliasing analysers intend to make and compute useful information for understanding aliasing in programs.|$|R
40|$|This project aims to {{automatically}} generate local newsletter by applying topic classification and geographic reference. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed for the topic classifica-tion task. To retrieve only user entered location name related documents, we apply geographic reference to validate location name, enrich query with <b>alias</b> <b>names</b> and solve place name ambi-guity problem. The dataset of 20 -newsgroup that is collected from 20 different news sites {{is used in}} this project. For SVM classifier construction, we use LibSVM and for the geographic reference application, we employ Gazetteer, WordNet and Named Entity Tagger. The text preprocessing process includes stemming, stop words removal, too short/long or frequent/infrequent words deletion. The TF-IDF weight calculation is applied to convert text into vectors and scripts pro-vided by LibSVM are applied to search optimal parameters for classifier construction. The Gazetteer is used to check whether the user entered text is a valid location name and the Word-Net service is applied to collect all possible <b>alias</b> <b>names</b> for a place. Named Entity Tagger is employed to extract only location named entities for document filtering. With the collection of <b>alias</b> <b>names</b> collection and location named entities, we search documents to retrieve only local related documents as expected. After implementing this automatic local newsletter generator, we analyse experimental re-sults in several ways: Effectiveness of text preprocessing, optimal number of features and opti-mal parameters for classifiers, location name enrichment, and location named entity identifica-tion. The best feature number and optimal parameters are chosen by experiments for our final classifier. The experimental results show that our project is able to successfully retrieve local information from numerous documents and our solutions for topic classification and geographic reference are significant and effective...|$|R
