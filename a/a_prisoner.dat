5|$|As {{a ranking}} prisoner-of-war, Colonel Stacy {{was the subject}} of {{high-level}} correspondence and actions of General George Washington and other leaders of the Continental Army. During April 1780, General Lafayette, who fought with the Americans during the Revolution, hand-carried a letter from General William Heath to General Washington, describing a reported Loyalist and British strategy concerning Stacy. The strategy was to continue holding Colonel Stacy as a prisoner-of-war, and to use Stacy in <b>a</b> <b>prisoner</b> exchange, should Colonel Butler or another ranking Loyalist officer, Sir John Johnson, be captured by the Continental Army. During September 1780, General Washington attempted to arrange <b>a</b> <b>prisoner</b> exchange for Colonel Stacy, but was unsuccessful. On November 1, 1781, the General Assembly of Massachusetts passed a Resolve urging Governor John Hancock to encourage General Heath to pursue <b>a</b> <b>prisoner</b> exchange for Stacy.|$|E

40|$|In three {{experiments}} {{we examined}} the notion that interpretative thinking guides impression formation when playing <b>a</b> <b>prisoner's</b> dilemma game. In a first experiment, we demonstrated that an interpretation goal is spontaneously triggered upon receiving ambiguous information about an interaction partner {{in the context of}} <b>a</b> <b>prisoner's</b> dilemma game. In Experiment 2, we examined whether in this context accessible knowledge is used as an interpretation frame for judging the interaction partner. Indeed, we found that subliminally primed extreme person exemplars led to an assimilation effect in person judgment in <b>a</b> <b>prisoner's</b> dilemma game, whereas they led to a contrast effect when person judgments were made in a control condition. Finally in experiment 3, priming a comparison goal before entering <b>a</b> <b>prisoner's</b> dilemma game led participants to use subliminally presented extreme exemplars again as a standard of comparison in the judgment of an interaction partner.
