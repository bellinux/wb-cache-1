On 12 July 1852, Wallace embarked for the UK on the brig Helen. After 26 days at sea, the ship's cargo caught fire and the crew was forced to abandon ship. All of the specimens Wallace had on the ship, mostly collected during the last two, and most interesting, years of his trip, were lost. He managed to save <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>notes</b> and pencil sketches and little else.|$|E
25|$|At {{an early}} age, Brain {{was allowed to}} blow <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>notes</b> on his father's horn every Saturday morning. Aubrey Brain held the belief that {{students}} should not study the horn seriously until the later teenage years, when the teeth and embouchure became fully developed. During these years, Brain studied piano and organ. It {{was not until the}} age of 15 that Dennis was to transfer from St Paul's School to the Royal Academy of Music to study horn, under his father's tutelage. While there, he continued his piano studies under Max Pirani and organ under G. D. Cunningham.|$|E
25|$|The Army's {{organization}} soon proved inept in {{the course}} of the Peninsula Campaign. The corps-like structure was rearranged before the Seven Days Battle to converge with the requirements of actual command. In the course of this battle the Army featured two Corps; Jackson's and Magruder's, with four and three divisions respectively, and three actual divisions with five to six brigades. Also the Defense District of North Carolina answered directly to the Army as well as the Reserve Artillery with six battalions and the cavalry with six regiments. The army's complete strength was about 90,000 soldiers. The exact strength cannot be determined, because only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>notes</b> for actual provisionings survived. The estimated strength results, if not explicitly noted, from in-battle dispatches.|$|E

25|$|Performers {{then begin}} the main {{compositions}} with a section called raga alapana exploring the raga. In this, {{they use the}} sounds aa, ri, na, ta, etc. instead of swaras to slowly elaborate the notes and flow of the raga. This begins slowly and builds to a crescendo, and finally establishes a complicated exposition of the raga that shows the performer's skill. All of this is done without any rhythmic accompaniment, or beat. Then the melodic accompaniment (violin or veena), expounds the raga. Experienced listeners can identify many ragas after they hear just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>notes.</b> With the raga thus established, the song begins, usually with lyrics. In this, the accompaniment (usually violin, sometimes veena) performs along with the main performer and the percussion (such as a mridangam). In {{the next stage of}} the song, they may sing niraval or kalpanaswaram again.|$|E
25|$|The poems used in most Kurdish {{music are}} filled with stories of romance and unrequited love. These poems have often two verses, which are divided in ten, eleven, or twelve syllables, and {{are based on the}} Gathas of the Zoroastrians. Kurdish melodies are very simple; their range is usually {{confined}} to <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>notes.</b> The form of the music is often strophic, and every gourani has a particular melody that is sung with various stanzas. At the end of every stanza the strophe is repeated unchanged throughout the song. Every gourani is characterized by a specific strophe. Similar to a lied or a chanson, gouranis may be accompanied by instrumental sections, which have three parts: prelude, middle section, and the ending. The prelude and the ending are performed by the group, and the middle section is performed in the form of call and response.|$|E
500|$|These {{days the}} most popular {{clarinet}} is the B clarinet. However, the clarinet in A, just a semitone lower, is commonly used in orchestral music. [...] Since {{the middle of the}} 19th century the bass clarinet (nowadays invariably in B but with extra keys to extend the register down <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>notes)</b> has become an essential addition to the orchestra. The clarinet family ranges from the (extremely rare) BBB octo-contrabass to the A piccolo clarinet. The clarinet has proved to be an exceptionally flexible instrument, equally at home in the classical repertoire as in concert bands, military bands, marching bands, klezmer, and jazz.|$|E

The song has no proper distinction between the verses or chorus section (with only a falsetto refrain of [...] "You and I are gonna live forever" [...] marking off sections), and the vocal melody only consists of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>notes.</b> The simplistic arrangement of the song [...] "meant the song never resolved".

The Sunday Herald also compared the series unfavourably to ER, writing that Holby City served to highlight ER [...] "true sophistication". Morgan refuted these negative comparisons, however, writing that: [...] "The sign of great drama is when a scriptwriter and director can make a symphony out of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>notes</b> and Holby City creators have done that. It doesn't have the budget of ER, but it is proving just as compelling." ...|$|E

As Edward Bloom first enters the town, Redden can be seen on a porch plucking <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>notes</b> from [...] "Dueling Banjos". Burton was pleased with the result: [...] "If you're watching the film and don't recognise the solitary, enigmatic figure on the porch, that's fine.

500|$|The Robot Devil {{tells them}} {{that the only way}} to win back Bender's soul is to beat him in a fiddle-playing contest, as {{required}} under the [...] "Fairness in Hell Act of 2275". The Robot Devil goes first, playing Antonio Bazzini's [...] "La Ronde des Lutins". Leela responds, having experience in playing the drums, but after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>notes</b> it is clear Leela's fiddle-playing is pathetic, so she assaults the Robot Devil with the fiddle instead. As Fry, Leela, and Bender flee the Robot Devil's clutches, Bender steals the wings off a flying torture robot, attaches them to his back, and airlifts Fry and Leela to safety. Leela drops the heavy golden fiddle onto the Robot Devil's head, making them light enough to escape. Bender promises to never be too good or too evil, but to remain as he was before joining the Temple of Robotology.|$|E

[...] Fred Bronson of The Hollywood Reporter noted that DeGarmo already had experience of playing {{the part of a}} [...] "Jersey Girl" [...] because she had once starred in the musical The Toxic Avenger, which is set in New Jersey. Bronson also noted that she was having a fun time playing the part. Describing Angelina, DeGarmo labeled her as [...] "over-the-top" [...] and a [...] "gum-smacking, tone-deaf princess whose hair is as large as her attitude." [...] She said [...] "I'm having a blast! Angelina believes she's Barbra Streisand mixed with Celine Dion." [...] The character is described as an alter ego by DeGarmo. DeGarmo revealed that she was having a [...] "blast" [...] picking out costumes for the over-the-top part: [...] "Her hair and make-up are icing on the cake" [...] she stated. Additionally, she noted that [...] "Angelina’s style has taken <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>notes</b> from the cast of Jersey Shore." [...] Comparing Angelina to herself, she said: [...] "There are some things that I, Diana, would be too terrified to walk out of the house wearing, but Angelina is not afraid." [...] She is also described as a [...] "mafia princess". DeGarmo said: [...] "You never know what she's going to do, which keeps everyone on their toes. One minute she's nice, the next she snaps". According to DeGarmo, Angelina is fully aware that her father is a mob boss and: [...] "she doesn't mind. She likes throwing around her weight at any time. She loves the perks of being a mob boss's daughter. She lives for it." [...] Also, her character was probably based off of Angela Viracco, in the 1985 movie The Last Dragon.|$|E
500|$|Author Veda Boyd Jones {{wrote that}} [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" [...] is a: [...] "catchy song with {{nonsensical}} words". This was echoed by Joe Nick Patoski in his book, Texas Monthly on Texas Women, where he called Selena [...] "savvy enough" [...] {{to record a}} song that has a [...] "catchy", [...] "nonsensical but eminently hummable" [...] melody. According to Ed Morales who wrote in his book The Latin Beat, [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" [...] is an easily [...] "forgettable throwaway" [...] for the average listener, but found the it [...] "catchy" [...] and said it [...] "sticks in your gut". The Spanish-language magazine Personajes, enjoyed the song's ability to [...] "make everyone dance". Jessica Lucia Roiz of the Latin Times called the recording a [...] "happy-go-lucky tune". John LaFollette of The Monitor called the track [...] "playful". Marjua Estevez of Vibe called it a: [...] "sassy dance track". Eliza Thompson of Cosmopolitan asserted that Selena's songs—particularly [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom"—resonate a [...] "fun atmosphere". Canadian magazine Tribute, called [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" [...] an [...] "upbeat hit". Writing for Out magazine, Xorje Olivares explained how [...] "universal" [...] it is, and [...] "that you can't help but feel nostalgic" [...] after listening to <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>notes</b> of [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom". John Dyzer of Entertainment Weekly, called the song a [...] "beach-blanket anthem" [...] and a [...] "novelty hit". Dita Quinones of NBC San Diego, called it a [...] "feel-good spirit" [...] track. Ashley Velez called [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" [...] a [...] "feel good song" [...] and noted how the [...] "fun [...] " [...] is [...] "one of Selena's most memorable contributions to the Latin music world." [...] According to Mario Tarradell of the Dallas Morning News, the song contains the [...] "bubbly, effervescent personality, the chica-del-barrio (the girl from the barrio) charm" [...] in her recording, and believed the remixed version, found on the posthumous release Dreaming of You, was done {{so that it was}} [...] "palatable club play".

500|$|Arranger Nelson Riddle found Sinatra to be a [...] "perfectionist {{who drove}} himself and {{everybody}} around him relentlessly", {{and stated that}} his collaborators approached him {{with a sense of}} uneasiness because of his unpredictable and often volatile temperament. [...] Granata comments that Sinatra was almost fanatically obsessed with perfection to the point that people began wondering if he was genuinely concerned about the music or showing off his power over others. On days when he felt that his voice was not right, he would know after only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>notes</b> and would postpone the recording session until the following day, yet still pay his musicians. [...] After a period of performing, Sinatra tired of singing a certain set of songs and was always looking for talented new songwriters and composers to work with. Once he found ones that he liked, he actively sought to work with them as often as he could, and made friends with many of them. He once told Sammy Cahn, who wrote songs for Anchor's Away, [...] "if you're not there Monday, I'm not there Monday". Over the years he recorded 87 of Cahn's songs, of which 24 were composed by Jule Styne, and 43 by Jimmy Van Heusen. The Cahn-Styne partnership lasted from 1942 until 1954, when Van Heusen succeeded him as Sinatra's main composer. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Sinatra insisted upon direct input regarding arrangements and tempos for his recordings. He would spend weeks thinking about the songs he wanted to record, and would keep an arranger in mind for each song. If it were a mellow love song, he would ask for Gordon Jenkins. If it were a [...] "rhythm" [...] number, he would think of Billy May, or perhaps Neil Hefti or some other favored arranger. Jenkins considered Sinatra's musical sense to be unerring. His changes to Riddle's charts would frustrate Riddle, yet he would usually concede that Sinatra's ideas were superior. Barbara Sinatra notes that Sinatra would almost always credit the songwriter {{at the end of each}} number, and would often make comments to the audience, such as [...] "Isn't that a pretty ballad" [...] or [...] "Don't you think that's the most marvelous love song", delivered with [...] "childlike delight". She states that after each show, Sinatra would be [...] "in a buoyant, electrically charged mood, a post-show high that would take him hours to come down from as he quietly relived every note of the performance he'd just given".|$|E
