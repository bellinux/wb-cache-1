40|$|In {{computerized}} adaptive testing (CAT) procedures {{within the}} framework of probabilistic test theory the difficulty of an item is adjusted to the ability of the respondent, with the aim of maximizing the amount of information generated per item, thereby also increasing test economy and test reasonableness. However, earlier research indicates that respondents might feel over-challenged by a constant success probability of p= 0. 5 and therefore cannot come to a sufficiently high answer certainty within a reasonable timeframe. Consequently response time per item increases, which – depending on the test material – can outweigh the benefit of administering optimally informative items. Instead of a benefit, the result of using CAT procedures could be a loss of test economy. Based on this problem, an <b>adaptive</b> <b>success</b> control algorithm was designed and tested, adapting the success probability to the working style of the respondent. Persons who need higher answer certainty in order to come to a decision are detected and receive a higher success probability, in order to minimize the test duration (not the number of items as in classical CAT).

Both household coping strategies and larger-scale economic development efforts have caused severe natural resource degradation that limits future economic opportunities and endangers ecosystem services.

The Community Markets for Conservation (COMACO) model operates primarily with communities surrounding national parks, strengthening conservation benefits produced by these protected areas.

The ego goal orientation was significantly and small in meaningfulness related to <b>adaptive</b> <b>success</b> factors (rw=. 10), maladaptive success factors (rw=. 12), negative emotions (rw=. 11), undesirable behaviors (rw=. 23), amotivation (rw=. 16), extrinsic motivation (rw=. 28), external regulation (rw=. 21), intrinsic motivation (rw=. 14), performance/ego climate (rw=. 28), and perceived competence (rw=. 17).

The case study involves more than fifty years of experience with environmental contamination, pollution control, clean-up, and restoration and demonstrates the need for an adaptive approach to respond to new information, unintended consequences, and changed economic and ecological circumstances.
