5|$|The National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA, {{now known}} as the Alzheimer's Association) {{established}} the most commonly used NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria for diagnosis in 1984, extensively updated in 2007. These criteria require that the presence of cognitive impairment, and a suspected dementia syndrome, be confirmed by neuropsychological testing for a clinical diagnosis of possible or probable AD. A histopathologic confirmation including a microscopic examination of brain tissue is required for a definitive diagnosis. Good statistical reliability <b>and</b> <b>validity</b> have been shown between the diagnostic criteria and definitive histopathological confirmation. Eight cognitive domains are most commonly impaired in AD—memory, language, perceptual skills, attention, constructive abilities, orientation, problem solving and functional abilities. These domains are equivalent to the NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria as listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) published by the American Psychiatric Association.|$|E

5|$|The {{variety of}} {{positivism}} that remains dominant today is termed instrumental positivism. This approach eschews epistemological and metaphysical concerns (such as {{the nature of}} social facts) in favour of methodological clarity, replicability, reliability <b>and</b> <b>validity.</b> This positivism {{is more or less}} synonymous with quantitative research, and so only resembles older positivism in practice. Since it carries no explicit philosophical commitment, its practitioners may not belong to any particular school of thought. Modern sociology of this type is often credited to Paul Lazarsfeld, who pioneered large-scale survey studies and developed statistical techniques for analysing them. This approach lends itself to what Robert K. Merton called middle-range theory: abstract statements that generalize from segregated hypotheses and empirical regularities rather than starting with an abstract idea of a social whole.|$|E

5|$|When Salten {{originally}} published Bambi in 1923, {{he did so}} under Germany's copyright laws, which required no statement that the novel was copyrighted. In the 1926 republication, he did include a United States copyright notice, so the work is considered to have been copyrighted in the United States in 1926. In 1936, Salten sold some rights to the novel to MGM producer Sidney Franklin who passed them on to Walt Disney {{for the creation of}} a film adaptation. After Salten's death in 1945, his daughter Anna Wyler inherited the copyright and renewed the novel's copyrighted status in 1954 (U.S. copyright law in effect at the time provided for an initial term of 28 years from the date of first publication in the U.S., which could be extended for an additional 28 years provided the copyright holder filed for renewal before the expiration of the initial copyright). In 1958, she formulated three agreements with Disney regarding the novel's rights. Upon her death in 1977, the rights passed to her husband, Veit Wyler, and her children, who held on to them until 1993 when he sold the rights to the publishing house Twin Books. Twin Books and Disney disagreed on the terms <b>and</b> <b>validity</b> of Disney's original contract with Anna Wyler and Disney's continued use of the Bambi name.|$|E

40|$|The article {{identifies}} {{a latent}} {{debate in the}} recent literature on the role and worth of experiments in economics and other social sciences concerning {{the relationship between the}} external <b>and</b> the internal <b>validity</b> of experimental designs. Our work identifies two incompatible views regarding the relationship between internal <b>and</b> external <b>validity</b> of experiments. While in the methodological literature references to {{the idea that there is}} a trade-off between the internal <b>and</b> external <b>validity</b> of experiments abound, this view coexists with the position stating that internal validity is rather a prerequisite of external validity. By identifying the contours of this implicit debate in the recent methodological literature around the use of experiments in the social sciences we call attention upon a series of insufficiently conceptualized issues regarding the central notions of internal <b>and</b> external <b>validity</b> <b>and</b> we question the standard view positing a trade-off between the two.

40|$|International audienceAnimal {{models of}} {{psychiatric}} disorders are usually discussed {{with regard to}} three criteria first elaborated by Willner; face, predictive <b>and</b> construct <b>validity.</b> Here, we draw the history of these concepts {{and then try to}} redraw and refine these criteria, using the framework of the diathesis model of depression that has been proposed by several authors. We thus propose a set of five major criteria (with sub-categories for some of them); homological validity (including species <b>validity</b> <b>and</b> strain <b>validity),</b> pathogenic validity (including ontopathogenic <b>validity</b> <b>and</b> triggering <b>validity),</b> mechanistic validity, face <b>validity</b> (including ethological <b>and</b> biomarker <b>validity)</b> <b>and</b> predictive <b>validity</b> (including induction <b>and</b> remission <b>validity).</b> Homological validity requires that an adequate species and strain be chosen: considering species validity, primates will be considered to have a higher score than drosophila, and considering strains, a high stress reactivity in a strain scores higher than a low stress reactivity in another strain. Pathological validity corresponds to the fact that, in order to shape pathological characteristics, the organism has been manipulated both during the developmental period (for example, maternal separation: ontopathogenic <b>validity)</b> <b>and</b> during adulthood (for example, stress: triggering validity). Mechanistic validity corresponds {{to the fact that the}} cognitive (for example, cognitive bias) or biological mechanisms (such as dysfunction of the hormonal stress axis regulation) underlying the disorder are identical in both humans <b>and</b> animals. Face <b>validity</b> corresponds to the observable behavioral (ethological validity) or biological (biomarker validity) outcomes: for example anhedonic behavior (ethological validity) or elevated corticosterone (biomarker validity). Finally, predictive validity corresponds to the identity of the relationship between the triggering factor and the outcome (induction <b>validity)</b> <b>and</b> between the effects of the treatments on the two organisms (remission validity). The relevance of this framework is then discussed regarding various animal models of depression...|$|R
