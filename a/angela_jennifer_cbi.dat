5000|$|Upon {{arriving}} at Room 404, Ted {{finds himself in}} the middle of a fantasy hostage situation between a husband and wife. Sigfried (David Proval), the husband, maniacally accuses Ted (whom he calls Theodore) of having slept with his wife, <b>Angela</b> (<b>Jennifer</b> Beals). At gunpoint, Ted is made to participate in the scenario, with uncertainty about what is real and part of the fantasy. At one point, he is stuck in the bathroom window and the party guest from the beginning of the segment appears in the one above, uttering the word [...] "ice" [...] and vomiting. Eventually, Ted escapes just as a different party guest (Paul Skemp) appears, looking for Room 404 and is greeted by Sigfried in the same manner as Ted at the beginning of the segment.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} reveal this voice as a {{narrative}} voice {{within the context}} of the novels we must subvert word voice. The narrative voice discovered opens up other layers of meaning to the stories narrated. I also intend to hear sounds and noises of the texts as voice, voice that is entitled now by its name to constitute the narrative voice through tropes. My thesis comprises three chapters, with each dedicated to a novel from <b>Angela</b> Carter and <b>Jennifer</b> Johnston. For my interpretation I follow the logic of the theories introduced here.

40|$|For {{the art and}} {{literary}} historians gathered together in this volume (<b>Angela</b> Bennett Segler, <b>Jennifer</b> Borland, Karen Eileen Overbey, Nancy Thompson, and Maggie M. Williams), all students of medieval material, these tensions between surface and depth, present and past, concentration and skimming are all too familiar. The inherent contradictions of medieval objects, their irreducibility to either the purely intellectual or the merely physical, are at once the delights and {{the dangers of the}} art historian’s work. This book thus offeres a dialogue on the question of how our encounters with physical things spark a process and how objects might allow unique collisions between the past and the present, the human and the inanimate, the practice of history and lived experience. As works of medieval studies or art history, these essays are incomplete, awkward, and provisional. Some of them may even read like embarrassing teenage poetry. This collection is like that dusty box in the basement: it is full of raw, unedited, transparent expressions of affect, of the sort we have learned to hide...|$|R
40|$|<b>Angela</b> M Thompson, <b>Jennifer</b> M TrujilloDepartment of Clinical Pharmacy, University of Colorado Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Aurora, CO, USA Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this review {{is to provide a}} review of current data of the most {{recently}} approved glucagon-like peptide (GLP) - 1 -receptor agonist, dulaglutide, in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. To complete this, a PubMed search was performed to identify manuscripts published from 1947 to July 2015. The search terms “Trulicity”, “dulaglutide”, and “LY 2189265 ” were utilized, and publications were included if they evaluated the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, or patient-reported outcomes of dulaglutide. Dulaglutide is a GLP- 1 receptor agonist that mimics endogenous GLP- 1, the hormone produced in response to food intake. Modifications have been made to the molecule to delay breakdown and allow for once-weekly dosing. Dulaglutide has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with several agents, including metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone, and insulin lispro. Dulaglutide has demonstrated superior efficacy compared to placebo, metformin, insulin glargine, sitagliptin, and twice-daily exenatide. It was found to be noninferior to liraglutide. The most common adverse effects in clinical studies were gastrointestinal-related adverse events, and patient satisfaction was high with the use of dulaglutide. Dulaglutide is an appealing option for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, based on its once-weekly dosing, A 1 c lowering comparable to liraglutide, weight reduction comparable to exenatide, and a similar adverse-effect profile to other GLP- 1 receptor agonists. Keywords: dulaglutide, GLP- 1 receptor agonist, T 2...|$|R
