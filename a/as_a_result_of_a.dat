50|$|Complications {{may occur}} {{immediately}} following the myocardial infarction or may take time to develop. Disturbances of heart rhythms, including atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation and heart block can arise <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> ischemia, cardiac scarring, and infarct location. Stroke is also <b>a</b> risk, either <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> clots transmitted from the heart during PCI, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> bleeding following anticoagulation, or <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> disturbances in the heart's ability to pump effectively <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the infarction. Regurgitation of blood through the mitral valve is possible, particularly if the infarction causes dysfunction of the papillary muscle. Cardiogenic shock <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the heart being unable to adequately pump blood may develop, dependent on infarct size, and {{is most likely to}} occur within the days following an acute myocardial infarction. Cardiogenic shock is the largest cause of in-hospital mortality. Rupture of the ventricular dividing wall or left ventricular wall may occur within the initial weeks. Dressler's syndrome, a reaction following larger infarcts and a cause of pericarditis is also possible.|$|R
