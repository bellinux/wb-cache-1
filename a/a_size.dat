After a period of frenetic construction, the navy mushroomed to <b>a</b> <b>size</b> of more than 400 ships on the Carthaginian ("Punic") pattern. Once completed, it could accommodate up to 100,000 sailors and embarked troops for battle. The navy thereafter declined in size.|$|E
5|$|In September 2009, Coulter {{began dating}} her manager Richard Harrison, and in August 2010, the couple {{went public with}} their relationship. Before meeting Harrison, Coulter was {{considered}} {{a role model for}} curvy girls and stated that she was proud of being <b>a</b> <b>size</b> 14 woman. She has since lost over 30 kilograms, which has transformed her into <b>a</b> <b>size</b> 8. The couple announced their engagement in the 7 January 2013 issue of New Idea magazine. After two years of being engaged, Coulter and Harrison married at the Château Bouffémont in Paris, France on 5 August 2015.

5|$|A small navy had {{operated}} at {{a fairly}} low level after the Second Samnite War, {{but it was}} massively upgraded during this period, expanding from a few primarily river- and coastal-based patrol craft to a full maritime unit. After a period of frenetic construction, the navy mushroomed to <b>a</b> <b>size</b> of more than 400 ships on the Carthaginian pattern. Once completed, it could accommodate up to 100,000 sailors and embarked troops for battle. The navy thereafter declined in size. This was partially because a pacified Roman Mediterranean called for little naval policing, and partially because the Romans chose to rely during this period on ships provided by Greek cities, whose peoples had greater maritime experience.|$|E
5|$|At 1200UTC on July13, the JTWC {{upgraded}} Billie {{further to}} typhoon status, making Billie the first tropical cyclone {{to be monitored}} by the JTWC since its inception earlier in 1959. Now tracking steadily towards the northwest, the typhoon reached its peak intensity at 1200UTC {{the next day with}} maximum sustained winds of 165km/h (105mph) according to the JTWC and a minimum barometric pressure assessed by the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) at 970mbar (hPa; 28.64inHg). By this time Billie's eye had shrunk to <b>a</b> <b>size</b> roughly 50km (30mi) in diameter. At 0900UTC on July15, Billie passed just 30km (20mi) north of Taiwan; fifteen hours later the typhoon made landfall north of Fuzhou, China in Zhejiang with winds estimated at 120km/h (75mph).|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1844, Willamette University's {{library was}} started {{two years after}} the {{establishment}} of the school. The library grew to <b>a</b> <b>size</b> of 2,500 volumes in 1874. University Hall (now Waller Hall), which was built in 1867, was one of the homes of the library in the early years. The library was located {{on the third floor of}} the building. The early name for the institution was the Willamette University Library, which by 1901 was a free, general library with both circulating and reference collections. That year the library collection had grown to 4,686 volumes, along with a total of 2,753 pamphlets.|$|E

5|$|Galileo {{showed a}} modern {{appreciation}} for the proper relationship between mathematics, theoretical physics, and experimental physics. He understood the parabola, {{both in terms of}} conic sections {{and in terms of the}} ordinate (y) varying as the square of the abscissa (x). Galilei further asserted that the parabola was the theoretically ideal trajectory of a uniformly accelerated projectile in the absence of air resistance or other disturbances. He conceded that there are limits to the validity of this theory, noting on theoretical grounds that a projectile trajectory of <b>a</b> <b>size</b> comparable to that of the Earth could not possibly be a parabola, but he nevertheless maintained that for distances up to the range of the artillery of his day, the deviation of a projectile's trajectory from a parabola would be only very slight.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{exceptional}} {{because he}} played point guard despite being 6ft 9in (2.06m), <b>a</b> <b>size</b> reserved normally for frontcourt players.

5|$|Kepler-6b {{is a hot}} Jupiter, {{having a}} mass 0.669 times that of Jupiter, but an average {{distance}} of only 0.046 AU from its star and, thus, an orbital period of 3.23 days. It is almost 10 times closer to its star than Mercury is from our Sun. As a result, Kepler-6b is strongly irradiated by its star, heating its atmosphere to a temperature of 1660 K and puffing it up to <b>a</b> <b>size</b> 1.3 times that of Jupiter. It {{may also be the}} case that Kepler-6b has a thermal inversion of its atmosphere, where temperature increases with increasing distance {{from the center of the}} planet. However, additional observations are required to confirm or refute this possibility.|$|E

5|$|ML {{contracted}} Cammell Laird of Birkenhead {{to build}} two smaller vessels of 1,800 tons. Commissioned in 1952, they were named the Manchester Pioneer and Explorer. They {{were joined by}} the secondhand 1,400-ton Manchester Prospector. The trio were the first of <b>a</b> <b>size</b> able {{to pass through the}} restricted-size canals and locks leading directly to Toronto and the other Great Lakes ports as far as Detroit, Michigan. This initiative, the first by a British line, and taken well ahead of the 1959 completion of the Saint Lawrence Seaway, gave the line a head start in the direct trade to the Midwest ports. During the winter months, when thick ice prevented navigation on the lakes, the trio were employed elsewhere, sometimes on charter to other lines.|$|E
5|$|Particularly {{striking}} in his symphonic poems is Liszt's approach to musical form. As purely musical structures, {{they do not}} follow a strict presentation and development of musical themes as they would under sonata form. Instead, they follow a loose episodic pattern, in which motifsrecurring melodies associated with a subjectare thematically transformed {{in a manner similar}} to that later made famous by Richard Wagner. Recapitulations, where themes are normally restated after they are combined and contrasted in development, are foreshortened, while codas, where pieces of music generally wind to a close, are greatly enlarged to <b>a</b> <b>size</b> and scope that can affect the listener's concept of the themes. Themes shuffle into new and unexpected patterns of order, and three- or four-movement structures roll into one in a continual process of creative experimentation.|$|E
5|$|Since Apollo, like Mercury, {{would require}} a launch escape system (LES) {{in case of a}} launch failure, a {{relatively}} small rocket was required for qualification flight testing of this system. <b>A</b> <b>size</b> bigger than the NAA Little Joe would be required, so the Little Joe II was built by General Dynamics/Convair.

5|$|Some of the Ticonderoga cannons, {{which were}} of <b>a</b> <b>size</b> and range not {{previously}} {{available to the}} Americans, were emplaced in fortifications around the city, and {{on the night of}} March 2, the Americans began to bombard the city with those cannon, to which the British responded with cannonades of their own. The American guns, under the direction of Colonel Knox, continued to exchange fire with the British until March 4. The exchange of fire did little damage to either side, although it did damage houses and kill some British soldiers in Boston.|$|E
5|$|The {{customs law}} set trade {{barriers}} to products {{produced in the}} country, and imposed high import tariffs on luxury goods, together with export quotas and tariffs on gold and silver. However, the law was not completely effective because of {{the control of the}} port, which did not allow the provinces a steady financial income. The exclusive control of the port was long resisted by federals from other provinces, and led to the conflict of Rosas and Justo José de Urquiza at the battle of Caseros. Despite the financial obstacles, the economy of Entre Ríos has grew to <b>a</b> <b>size</b> near that of Buenos Aires, with the decline of saladeros and the growth of wool production.|$|E
5|$|The {{density of}} indium, 7.31g/cm3, is also greater than gallium, but lower than thallium. Below the {{critical}} temperature, 3.41K, indium becomes a superconductor. At standard temperature and pressure, indium crystallizes in the face-centered tetragonal crystal {{system in the}} space group I4/mmm (lattice parameters:a=325pm, c=495pm): this is a slightly distorted face-centered cubic structure, where each indium atom has four neighbours at 324pm distance and eight neighbours slightly further (336pm). Indium displays a ductile viscoplastic response, found to be size-independent in tension and compression. However it does have <b>a</b> <b>size</b> effect in bending and indentation, associated to a length-scale of order 50–100µm, significantly large when compared with other metals.|$|E

5|$|The {{electron}} {{is by far}} {{the least}} massive of these particles at , with a negative electrical charge and <b>a</b> <b>size</b> that is too small to be measured using available techniques. It is the lightest particle with a positive rest mass measured. Under ordinary conditions, electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus by the attraction created from opposite electric charges. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than its atomic number, then it becomes respectively negatively or positively charged as a whole; a charged atom is called an ion. Electrons have been known since the late 19th century, mostly thanks to J.J. Thomson; see history of subatomic physics for details.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{commonly}} caught throughout its habitat, with sand flats, tidal gutters in estuaries and surf beaches commonly having producing good catches. Excessively shallow water, especially in proximity to Zostera beds may produce numerous undersized fish, {{and may be}} avoided if the young fish are too prevalent. Due to their preferred habitat, light lines with minimal weight added are employed to avoid spooking the fish, with a small running bean or ball sinker commonly rigged above <b>a</b> <b>size</b> 4 or 6 hook. Specialist whiting fishermen often use a red piece of tubing or beads to attract the whiting; whether this works {{has yet to be}} proved, but anecdotal evidence shows the fishermen's catches don't suffer. Baits used resemble the species natural prey, with prawns, nippers, a variety of bivalves and beach worms most often used, with more successful catches obtained using live bait.|$|E

40|$|For {{the design}} of mass-produced {{wearable}} objects for a population {{it is important to}} find a small number of <b>sizes,</b> called <b>a</b> <b>sizing</b> system, that will fit well {{on a wide range of}} individuals in the population. To obtain <b>a</b> <b>sizing</b> system that incorporates the shape of an identity along with its motion, we introduce a general framework to generate <b>a</b> <b>sizing</b> system for dynamic 3 D motion data. Based on a registered 3 D motion database <b>a</b> <b>sizing</b> system is computed for task-specific anthropometric measurements and tolerances, specified by designers. We generate the sizing system by transforming the problem into a box stabbing problem, which aims to find the lowest number of points stabbing a set of boxes. We use a standard computational geometry technique to solve this, it recursively computes the stabbing of lower-dimensional boxes. We apply our framework to a database of facial motion data for anthropometric measurements related to {{the design of}} face masks. We show the generalization capabilities of this sizing system on unseen data, and compute, for each <b>size,</b> <b>a</b> representative 3 D shape that can be used by designers to produce a prototype model.
