A five-month layover in Tahiti, during which many of the men lived ashore and formed relationships with native Polynesians, proved harmful to discipline. Relations between Bligh and his crew deteriorated after he began handing out increasingly harsh punishments, criticism and abuse, Christian being a particular target. <b>After</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> back at sea, Christian and others forced Bligh from the ship. Twenty-five men remained on board afterwards, including loyalists held against their will and others for whom there was no room in the launch.|$|E

The following day, the jury convicted Cisneros and Garza of capital murder for arranging Fischer's death. Neither of them showed any emotion when the verdict was given. Cisneros then removed her jewelry and was taken to the Cameron County jail with Garza. The jurors met the following day to discuss the punishment phase of the trial.|$|E
5|$|County went undefeated in Gannon's {{first four}} league games in charge. <b>After</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks,</b> this upturn in results saw Gannon offered the job full-time, which {{allowed him to}} guide County to safety.

Believing that safety would be assured on the final day of the season, he was proved correct as they managed to avoid relegation with a final day draw with champions Carlisle United. Comparisons were made to Sam Allardyce. As a {{committed}} Stockport fan, and already a legend at the club for his ten years as a player, he was loved by many County supporters. After delaying talks, he accepted a one-year rolling contract in the summer.|$|E
5|$|Eyre and {{the crew}} were landed and marched to Antibes, where they were imprisoned with the crew of a Sardinian frigate that had been {{captured}} the day before Speedy.

The British were placed in a dungeon at Antibes, with only straw to lie on, awaiting {{the decision of the}} authorities. <b>After</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> in this state, they were marched to Aix-en-Provence and were confined in the prison there. After a month imprisoned in Aix, Maximilien Robespierre fell and the Reign of Terror came to an end. The British were paroled. Eyre and the officers were taken to Romans, in Dauphiné where Eyre remained until May 1795 when he was released in exchange for a French officer. He faced a court-martial for the loss of Speedy, but was honourably acquitted.|$|E

5|$|For {{her fifth}} patrol, U-38 would again depart from Wilhelmshaven with Heinrich Liebe in command on 6 June 1940. She was {{to patrol the}} waters off {{southern}} Ireland. During this operation, Liebe would hit six ships, two of which were sailing in convoy at the time. On 14 June, U-38 sank the Greek steam freighter SS Mount Myrto. The next day, U-38 sank two ships, both sailing as part of Convoy HX-47, sailing from Halifax to England. First sunk was the Canadian steam freighter SS Erik Boye, followed by the Norwegian motor tanker MV Italia. Five days later, on 20 June, the Swedish steam freighter SS Tilia Gorthon was torpedoed and sunk. The Belgian steam freighter SS Luxembourg was destroyed on 21 June, followed by the Greek steam freighter SS Neion the following day. <b>After</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> at sea, U-38 returned to Wilhelmshaven on 2 July.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{left the}} failed mining {{operation}} in 1899, and travelled to London. Just after he arrived, the Second Boer War broke out, and the British government called for volunteers to join an expeditionary force. The only qualifications required {{were that the}} recruit could ride and shoot, and Hastings immediately applied to join the Suffolk Imperial Yeomanry. He was accepted, and {{after two weeks of}} training the regiment were given horses and boarded the S.S. Goth Castle to South Africa. The ship reached Cape Town <b>after</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks,</b> and the regiment disembarked. Their horses were considered too weak to be ridden, and so they were instead discharged and either put down or given to other soldiers. Hastings did not enjoy his time in the army; the weather was poor, the orders given were confusing and they were provided with minimal equipment.|$|E

5|$|In {{accordance}} with the Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law, a set of regulations promulgated by NASA on July 16 to codify its quarantine protocol, the astronauts continued in quarantine out of concern that the Moon might contain undiscovered pathogens and that the astronauts might {{have been exposed to}} them during their Moon walks. However, <b>after</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> in confinement (first in the Apollo spacecraft, then in their trailer on the Hornet, and finally in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at the Manned Spacecraft Center), the astronauts were given a clean bill of health. On August 10, 1969, the Interagency Committee on Back Contamination met in Atlanta and lifted the quarantine on the astronauts, on those who had joined them in quarantine (NASA physician William Carpentier and MQF project engineer John Hirasaki), and on Columbia itself. Loose equipment from the spacecraft would remain in isolation until the lunar samples were released for study.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} the Canton of Bern, Switzerland, on 21 October 1968, with the first scene shot being an aerial view of Bond climbing the stairs of Blofeld's mountain retreat. The scenes were shot atop the now-famous revolving restaurant Piz Gloria, located atop the Schilthorn {{near the village of}} Mürren. The location was found by production manager Hubert Fröhlich <b>after</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> of location scouting in France and Switzerland. The Swiss filming ended up running 56 days over schedule. In March 1969 production moved to England, with London's Pinewood Studios being used for interior shooting, and M's house being shot in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. In April the filmmakers went to Portugal, where principal photography wrapped in May. Filming finished on 23 June, two months later than planned, which was largely due to the warm Swiss winter, which had hampered shooting.|$|E

At dinner, Brian meets Arielle and Valéry's children and is introduced to Valéry's lover, a 25-year-old editor named Jane (Olivia Thirlby). Arielle later meets Brian's parents, Sam (Frank Langella) and Arlene (Glenn Close). Upon learning that Arielle is a married mother of two, Sam tells Brian that he disapproves of the relationship, while Arlene accepts that they love each other despite the circumstances. When Brian is invited to a New Yorker ceremony to receive an award for one of his short stories, he is joined by Arielle, Valéry, Jane, and his parents.

5|$|Aside from a {{tropical}} disturbance in August, the season began later than usual, the fourth consecutive season to do so. At {{the time it}} had the 4th latest start on record for the first named storm. Only about 20% of seasons have their first storm form after the middle of December, and the first named storm of this season, Ando, did not become {{a tropical}} storm until early January. However, January was active with three tropical cyclones, two of which became intense tropical cyclones, due to the active phase of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO). February returned to a period of inactivity, and generally there was minimal convection across the basin due to unusually dry air. This was spread by a powerful and persistent ridge that extended eastward from Madagascar, {{as well as an}} inactive phase of the MJO. Drought conditions occurred on Réunion {{due to the lack of}} rainfall. <b>After</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> of no tropical cyclones developing worldwide, an event unseen since 1995, the tropics became active again in early April.|$|E
5|$|Bellerophon {{returned}} to England in June, before departing {{to patrol the}} Western Approaches until September. She entered Portsmouth Dockyard again in October and underwent a refit costing £8,103. She resumed patrol and blockade duty in the Western Approaches in January 1796, at first under Cranstoun, but from April effectively under the acting-captaincy of Lieutenant John Loring. Cranstoun's replacement, Captain Henry D'Esterre Darby, arrived to take command in September. Blockade duty continued until early January 1797, when news reached the fleet that a French expedition had appeared off Ireland. Caught off guard, the Admiralty ordered Bellerophon {{and a number of}} other ships to patrol off Bantry Bay. By then the French expedition had been dispersed by bad weather, and <b>after</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> on patrol, Bellerophon put into Cork where she rendezvoused with the Irish squadron under Admiral Robert Kingsmill. Shortly after her return to Spithead in early March, Bellerophon was given new orders by the Admiralty. She sailed on 17 March, bound for Cadiz to join Sir John Jervis's Mediterranean Fleet blockading the port.|$|E
5|$|In response, the House of Commons {{prepared}} {{a set of}} four Resolutions, decrying these actions and restating the validity of Magna Carta and the legal requirement of habeas corpus.
