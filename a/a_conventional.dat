5|$|Instead of <b>a</b> <b>conventional</b> script, {{the pair}} pitched the pilot by {{recording}} reels of its storyboard, which Povenmire then mixed and dubbed to produce action and vocals.

5|$|The Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey is an American multi-mission, {{tiltrotor}} {{military aircraft}} with both vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), and short takeoff and landing (STOL) capabilities.

50|$|Lam {{presently}} {{serves as}} Chairman of Multibeam Corporation, which pioneered {{the development of}} CEBL (complementary electron beam lithography) and DEW (direct electron writing) systems. <b>As</b> <b>conventional</b> optical lithography reaches its limits, the required photomasks become very expensive.

500|$|Originally {{designed}} {{strictly for}} nuclear war, the B-1's development as <b>an</b> effective <b>conventional</b> bomber was delayed.

5|$|Thermotropic phases {{are those}} that occur in a certain {{temperature}} range. If the temperature rise is too high, thermal motion will destroy the delicate cooperative ordering of the LC phase, pushing the material into <b>a</b> <b>conventional</b> isotropic liquid phase. At too low temperature, most LC materials will form <b>a</b> <b>conventional</b> crystal. Many thermotropic LCs exhibit a variety of phases as temperature is changed. For instance, on heating {{a particular type of}} LC molecule (called mesogen) may exhibit various smectic phases followed by the nematic phase and finally the isotropic phase as temperature is increased. An example of a compound displaying thermotropic LC behavior is para-azoxyanisole.|$|E
5|$|While Klein's use of {{aluminium}} for a bicycle frames {{was not entirely}} novel, his use of large diameter tubes was. Aluminium alloys have a Young's modulus around a third that of steel, but with thicker tubes {{he was able to}} make a bicycle that weighed around 15% less than <b>a</b> <b>conventional</b> model.|$|E

5|$|A plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicle (PHEV or PHV), also known as a plug-in hybrid, is a hybrid {{electric vehicle}} with rechargeable batteries that can be restored to full charge by connecting a plug to an external electric power source. A plug-in hybrid shares the characteristics of both <b>a</b> <b>conventional</b> {{hybrid electric vehicle}} and an all-electric vehicle: it uses a gasoline engine and an electric motor for propulsion, but a PHEV has a larger battery pack that can be recharged, allowing operation in all-electric mode until the battery is depleted.|$|E
5|$|Also {{like her}} mother, whose Letters from Sweden was {{foundational}} {{to the writing}} of both History of a Six Weeks' Tour and Rambles, Shelley emphasised her maternal role in the text. She describes herself as <b>a</b> <b>conventional</b> figure, worrying about her son. Rather than the scandal-ridden young woman of her youth, which she wrote about in the Tour, she is now a demure, respectable, middle-aged woman.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively dsRNA can be {{supplied}} without genetic engineering. One {{approach is to}} add them to irrigation water. The molecules are absorbed into the plants' vascular system and poison insects feeding on them. Another approach involves spraying dsRNA like <b>a</b> <b>conventional</b> pesticide. This would allow faster adaptation to resistance. Such approaches would require low cost sources of dsRNAs that do not currently exist.|$|E

5|$|An {{independent}} {{company at}} this time had a nominal strength of 20 officers and 275 other ranks. Larger than <b>a</b> <b>conventional</b> infantry company, it was organised into three platoons, each of three sections, each of which contained two subsections. It had considerable firepower. Each subsection had a Bren light machine gun. The gunner's two assistants carried rifles and extra 30-round Bren magazines. A sniper also carried a rifle, as did one man equipped with rifle grenades. The remaining four or five men carried Owen submachine guns. Each platoon also had a section of 2-inch mortars.|$|E
5|$|At the Pierre Levasseur Company in Paris, Nungesser and Coli, {{working closely}} with Chief Engineer Émile Farret and {{production}} manager Albert Longelot, assisted {{in the design of}} the new Levasseur PL.8 biplane. Based on the Levasseur PL.4 developed for the Aéronavale to operate from the French aircraft carrier Béarn, the PL.8 was <b>a</b> <b>conventional,</b> single-bay, wood and fabric-covered biplane that carried a crew of two in a side-by-side, open cockpit.|$|E
5|$|Australia's lower order batted the {{tourists}} into {{control on the}} second morning. Despite the loss of Lindwall for 15 at 8/275, Tallon kept on batting in <b>a</b> <b>conventional</b> manner, supported by Johnston and Ernie Toshack, who scored their highest Test scores. Both tail-enders threw the bat at the ball, which often went in vastly different directions to where they had aimed their shots. Tallon put on 45 with Johnstonwho scored 29 before holing out for 53. Ending at 350, the Australians had regained the momentum, taking 92 runs from 66 minutes of hitting in the morning.|$|E
