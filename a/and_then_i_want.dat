500|$|Regarding her {{approach}} to acting, Moore {{said in a}} 2002 interview that she leaves 95 percent of the performance to be discovered on set: [...] "I {{want to have a}} sense of who a character is, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to get there and have it happen to me on camera." [...] The aim, she said, is to [...] "try to get yourself in a position to let the emotion [...] to you, that you don't bring the emotion to it... and when it happens, there's nothing better or more exciting or more rewarding." ...|$|E

So kind Mrs. B. had the carriage, and off we drove together. By and by we found ourselves out in the country, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to get out and}} walk.|$|R

"Now," [...] said Mary Erskine to the children, as {{they were}} sitting at the table, {{at the close of}} the breakfast, and after Thomas had gone away, [...] "you may go out and play for an hour while I finish my morning work, and put the baby to sleep, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> you to come in and have a school." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{want this}} man {{to be a man}} of natural intelligence, of {{individual}} character, absolutely open and broad minded; and show how the Creator of the earth has got him in a rat trap--put him here [...] "willy nilly" [...] (you know the Omar verse); <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to show what he does about it.

There's a bundle of Papa's when he was gone out to the Crimean War, and that's to have a frigate on it, because of the Calliope--his ship, you know; and there's one bundle of dear Aunt Sarah's--that's to have a rose, because I always think her memory is like the rose in my hymn, you know; and Grandmamma, she's to have--I think perhaps I could copy {{a bit of the}} tower of Westminster Abbey out of the print, because one sees it out of her window; and, oh! I thought of so many more, but you see I can't do it without a real good paint-box, and that costs three and sixpence. Now, Miss Fosbrook, is it stingy to wish to do that?" ...|$|E

40|$|The {{scope of}} the study was not to {{experiment}} but to explore and analyse the evolution of the team since I was directly involved in its training. Therefore, I was in direct daily contact with the members of the lot, realising numerous findings and observations during the return matches of the championship with every new method and training means proposed, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to observe the real reasons which lead to the team’s regression {{by the end of the}} competition season 2013 - 2014...|$|R

6000|$|... "They won't thank me--they won't thank me," [...] Valentin murmured. [...] "They {{will pass}} an atrocious night, and Urbain doesn't like {{the early morning}} air. I don't {{remember}} ever {{in my life to}} have seen him before noon--before breakfast. No one ever saw him. We don't know how he is then. Perhaps he's different. Who knows? Posterity, perhaps, will know. That's the time he works, in his cabinet, at the history of the Princesses. But I had to send for them--hadn't I? <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to see my mother sit there where you sit, and say good-by to her. Perhaps, after all, I don't know her, and she will have some surprise for me. Don't think you know her yet, yourself; perhaps she may surprise YOU. But if I can't see Claire, I don't care for anything. I have been thinking of it--and in my dreams, too. Why did she go to Fleurieres to-day? She never told me. What has happened? Ah, she ought to have guessed I was here--this way. It {{is the first time in}} her life she ever disappointed me. Poor Claire!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile, at Mrs Keswick's house Mrs Null {{was acting}} just as conscientiously {{as she knew}} how. She had had some conversations with Freddy on the subject, and she had assured him, {{and at the same}} time herself, that what she was doing was the only thing that could be done. [...] "It was dreadfully hard for me to get the money to come down here," [...] she said to him,--"you not helping me a bit, as {{ordinary}} husbands do--and I can't afford to go back until I have accomplished something. It's very strange that she stays away so long, without telling anybody where she has gone to, but I know she is queer, and I suppose she has her own reasons for what she does. She can't be staying away on my account, for she doesn't know who I am, and wouldn't have any objections to me if she did know. I suspect it is something about Junius which keeps her away, and I suppose she thinks he is still here. But one of them must soon come back, and if I can see him, or find out from her where he is, it will be all right. It seems to me, Freddy, that if I could have a good talk with Junius things would begin to look better for you and me. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to put him on his guard about this gentleman who is looking for him. By the way, I suppose I ought to write a letter to Mr Croft, or he'll think I have given up the job, and will set somebody else on the track, and that is what I don't want him to do. I can't say that I have positively anything to report, but I can say that I have strong hopes of success, considering where I am. As soon as I found that Junius had really left the North, I concluded that this would be the best place to come to for him. And now, Freddy, there's nothing for us to do but to wait, and if we can make ourselves useful here I'm sure we will be glad to do it. We both hate being lazy, and a little housekeeping and farm managing will be good practice for us during our honeymoon." ...|$|E
60|$|It is no use {{to pretend}} that in {{little over a year}} I can have become {{accustomed}} to the eventlessness of life in Altruria. I go on for a good many days together and do not miss the exciting incidents you have in America, and then suddenly I am wolfishly hungry for the old sensations, just as now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> meat, though I know I should loathe the sight and smell of it if I came within reach of it. You would laugh, I dare say, at the Altrurian papers, and what they print for news. Most of the space is taken up with poetry, and character study in the form of fiction, and scientific inquiry of every kind. But now and then there is a report of the production of a new play in one of the capitals; or an account of an open-air pastoral in one of the communes; or the progress of some public work, like the extension of the National Colonnade; or the wonderful liberation of some section from malaria; or the story of some good man or woman's life, ended at the patriarchal age they reach here. They also print selected passages of capitalistic history, from the earliest to the latest times, showing how in war and pestilence and needless disaster the world outside Altruria remains essentially the same that it was at the beginning of civilization, with some slight changes through the changes of human nature for the better in its slow approaches to the Altrurian ideal. In noting these changes the writers get some sad amusement out {{of the fact that the}} capitalistic world believes human nature cannot be changed, though cannibalism and slavery and polygamy have all been extirpated in the so-called Christian countries, and these things were once human nature, which is always changing, while brute nature remains the same. Now and then they touch very guardedly on that slavery, worse than war, worse than any sin or shame conceivable to the Altrurians, in which uncounted myriads of women are held and bought and sold, and they have to note that in this the capitalistic world is without the hope of better things. You know what I mean, Dolly; every good woman knows the little she cannot help knowing; but if you had ever inquired into that horror, as I once felt obliged to do, you would think it the blackest horror of the state of things where it must always exist as long as there are riches and poverty. Now, when so many things in America seem bad dreams, I cannot take refuge in thinking that a bad dream; the reality was so deeply burnt into my brain by the words of some of the slaves; and when I think of it I want to grovel on the ground with my mouth in the dust. But I know this can only distress you, for you cannot get away from the fact as I have got away from it; that there it is in the next street, perhaps in the next house, and that any night when you leave your home with your husband, you may meet it at the first step from your door.|$|E

Talking to XXL while in prison, XXXTentacion announced 17, I Need Jesus and Members Only Vol. 3 saying: I got this really really, really good album called 17.

5000|$|Early in {{the summer}} of 1875, he met Siri von Essen, a 24-year-old {{aspiring}} actress who, by virtue of her husband, was a baroness - he became infatuated with her. Strindberg described himself as a [...] "failed author" [...] at this time: [...] "I feel like a deaf-mute," [...] he wrote, [...] "as I cannot speak and am not permitted to write; sometimes I stand {{in the middle of my}} room that seems like a prison cell, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to scream so that walls and ceilings would fly apart, and I have so much to scream about, and therefore I remain silent." [...] As a result of an argument in January 1876 concerning the inheritance of the family firm, Strindberg's relationship with his father was terminated (he did not attend his funeral in February 1883). From the beginning of 1876, Strindberg and Siri began to meet in secret. Following a successful audition that December, Siri became an actress at the Royal Theatre. They married a year later, on 30 December 1877; Siri was seven months pregnant at the time. Their first child was born prematurely on 21 January 1878 and died two days later. On 9 January 1879, Strindberg was declared bankrupt. In November 1879, his novel The Red Room was published. A satire of Stockholm society, it has frequently been described as the first modern Swedish novel. While receiving mixed reviews in Sweden, it was acclaimed in Denmark, where Strindberg was hailed as a genius. As a result of The Red Room, he had become famous throughout Scandinavia. Edvard Brandes wrote that the novel [...] "makes the reader want to join the fight against hypocrisy and reaction." [...] In his response to Brandes, Strindberg explained that: ...|$|E

They expected that volunteered answers would be “disproportionately from men” and would lead to the “same small group of students dominating whole-class discussions.” Participants expected that randomly selecting students to share their thinking would result in “a greater diversity of students reporting answers in class” and would support “a whole community of students, rather than just the one loud student up front.” Hearing from a small number of students may limit an instructor’s ability to effectively monitor and respond to student thinking in real time.|$|E

So, by 2003, the usage had become standard.
