5|$|Herds {{of red and}} {{fallow deer}} also roam freely within much of Richmond and Bushy Park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained. Epping Forest is also known for its fallow deer, which can {{frequently}} be seen in herds {{to the north of}} the Forest. A rare population of melanistic, black fallow deer is also maintained at the Deer Sanctuary near Theydon Bois. Muntjac deer, which escaped from deer parks at the turn of the twentieth century, are also found in the forest. While Londoners <b>are</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city, more recently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature, and whole herds of fallow and white-tailed deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of London's green spaces.|$|E

25|$|Humanity {{tries to}} steer it, {{but as long}} as the modern institutions, with all their uncertainty, endure, we {{will never be able to}} {{influence}} its course.

25|$|The old Norse {{calendar}} {{consisted of}} a summer half year and a winter half year, not the four seasons modern Europeans <b>are</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to.</b> The winter {{half of the year}} began in mid-to-late October, the summer half of the year began in mid-to-late April. Some blót were associated with these turning points.|$|E
25|$|Most Tunisians <b>are</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> {{references}} {{made about}} the Muslim world, for spiritual inspiration, literary metaphor, historical analogy. Within Islam the three primary cultural spheres, each stemming from a world ethno-linguistic civilization, are: Arab, Iranian, Turkish. Each influenced Islam as a whole, as its sophisticated cultural contours bear witness. Each likewise benefited Tunisia.|$|E
60|$|The Sultan who <b>was</b> not <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> see his offers {{rejected}} inquired their reasons, and Prince Bahman {{explained that}} they did not wish to leave their sister, and <b>were</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> do nothing without consulting all three together.|$|R

25|$|Women and {{children}} <b>are</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> eating {{different parts of}} the seal because they wait until the hunters are done eating. Intestines are the first thing to be chosen and then any leftover pieces of the liver are consumed. Finally, ribs and backbone are eaten and any remaining meat is distributed among the camp.|$|E
25|$|Since {{crayfish}} <b>are</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> {{being in}} ponds or rivers, {{they will have}} a tendency to shift gravel around {{on the bottom of the}} tank, creating mounds or trenches to emulate a burrow.

60|$|The evening passed pleasantly.

25|$|The Nova Vulgata {{has been}} criticized by those who see it as being in some verses of the Old Testament a new {{translation}} rather than a revision of Jerome's work. Also, some of its readings sound unfamiliar to those who <b>are</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> the Clementine. Traditional Catholics object against the Nova Vulgata because in their view it lacks Latin manuscript support and breaks with the historic worship tradition of the Church.|$|E
25|$|Summerland, an {{environment}} {{shaped by the}} thoughts of the inhabitants, appears relatively Earth-like because that's what the newly dead <b>are</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to.</b> Communication is telepathic, travel instantaneous. There's no need to eat or sleep. The inhabitants, all of whom possess an aura, can spend time relaxing, studying, or working — though not for profit. There are scientists and artists, many of whom work to subtly influence the minds of Earth's inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{prides itself}} on being a society that {{supports}} gender equality. While, in reality, much gender inequality persists, there are indeed laws in place to protect the equal rights of everyone, regardless of gender. Depending on the home country, U.S. society may contain a much higher level of gender equality than immigrants <b>are</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to,</b> particularly if immigrants come from a traditionally patriarchal society. The disparity in gender norms between different cultures may cause gender roles in the family to shift.|$|E

25|$|The company {{spun off}} its Travelers Property and Casualty {{insurance}} underwriting business in 2002. The spin off {{was prompted by}} the insurance unit's drag on Citigroup stock price because Traveler's earnings were more seasonal and vulnerable to large disasters, particularly the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in downtown New York City. It was also difficult to sell this kind of insurance directly to customers since most industrial customers <b>are</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> purchasing insurance through a broker.|$|E
25|$|Although tilt {{and swing}} are {{normally}} used {{to maximize the}} part of the image that is within the DOF, they also can be used, in combination with a small f-number, to give selective focus to a plane that isn't perpendicular to the lens axis. With this technique, it is possible to have objects at greatly different distances from the camera in sharp focus and yet have a very shallow DOF. The effect can be interesting because it differs from what most viewers <b>are</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> seeing.|$|E
25|$|Norwegians <b>are</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> variation, and may {{perceive}} Danish and Swedish only as slightly more distant dialects. This {{is because they}} have two official written standards, {{in addition to the}} habit of strongly holding on to local dialects. The people of Stockholm, Sweden and Copenhagen, Denmark, have the greatest difficulty in understanding other Scandinavian languages. In the Faroe Islands and Iceland, learning Danish is mandatory. This causes Faroese people as well as Icelandic people to become bilingual in two very distinct North Germanic languages, making it relatively easy for them to understand the other two Mainland Scandinavian languages.|$|E

25|$|These {{individuals}} {{may be trying}} to reenact unresolved issues with their parents. A history of frequent illnesses may also {{contribute to the development of}} this disorder. In some cases, individuals afflicted with FD <b>are</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> actually being sick, and thus return to their previous state to recapture what they once considered the 'norm.' Another cause is a history of close contact with someone (a friend or family member) who had a severe or chronic condition. The patients found themselves subconsciously envious of the attention said relation received, and felt that they themselves faded into the background. Thus medical attention makes them feel glamorous and special.|$|E
25|$|Four women (including future star Tea Leoni) were {{selected}} {{to be in a}} show called Angels '88, which was to serve as an updated version of the show. The show was later named Angels '89 after production delays, but the project was abandoned before notice was taken. From 1998–1999, Telemundo and Sony produced a show called Ángeles. The weekly hour format did not catch on with Hispanic viewers, who <b>are</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> watching telenovelas nightly and the series was soon canceled. In 2002, a German version of Charlie's Angels, , was produced by the German channel RTL. The show was known as Anges de choc in French-speaking countries, and as Three Wild Angels in English-speaking ones.|$|E
25|$|Brown Malts are dryed with Straw, Wood and Fern, etc. The straw-dryed is the best, but {{the wood}} sort has a most unnatural Taste, that few can bear with, but the necessitous, {{and those that}} <b>are</b> <b>accustomed</b> <b>to</b> its strong smoaky tang; yet it is much used {{in some of the}} Western Parts of England, and many {{thousand}} Quarters of this malt has been formerly used in London for brewing the Butt-keeoing-beers with, and that because it sold for two shillings per Quarter cheaper than Straw-dryed Malt, nor was this Quality of the Wood-dryed Malt much regarded by some of its Brewers, for that its ill Taste is lost in nine or twelve Months, by the Age of the Beer, and the strength of the great Quantity of Hops that were used in its preservation.|$|E
