50|$|Supercar Street Challenge is {{a racing}} game {{developed}} by Exakt Entertainment {{and published by}} Activision for the PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows. It was produced early in the PlayStation 2's lifespan. It was advertised on The Fast and the Furious DVD as the game for the movie. What truly made the game unique was the player's ability to completely design their own supercar by choosing <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>section</b> and modifying how much to adjust that section. The game featured some modern-day supercars like the Saleen S7, the Pontiac GTO concept, and the Callaway C12. It was criticized for having exceptionally long loading times. The player could choose several tracks per city, including cities like Rome, Monaco, Los Angeles, and London.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:—Road {{transport}} is {{the most}} commonly used way of transportation in India and in many countries. The passenger bus {{plays an important role in}} public transport. The capacity of carrying more passengers compared to other road transport medium is unfavourable in the event of major bus accident. The rollover crash accident of passenger bus, although occurs less frequently than any other type of accident, the fatality rate and severe injuries are highest in rollover crash. Hence the structure of the bus needs to be strong enough to ensure the minimum damage and at the same time it should absorb maximum impact energy. Safety regulations are in force defining minimum structural rigidity under rollover crash. The Automotive Industry Standard (AIS- 031) is implemented in India since October 2008 which specifies the requirements and methods to calculate the strength of superstructure of buses during and after rollover. The AIS- 031 specifies four different test methods viz. physical rollover test on a complete vehicle, rollover test on <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>section,</b> pendulum test on <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>section,</b> and verification of strength of superstructure by calculation (numerical simulation). In this work numerical simulation of rollover test using finite element method is followed. First the numerical model is build according to the guidelines provided in AIS- 031 and validated by the experimental testing. A validated numerical model is used to evaluate the rollover performance of the superstructure of the bus. Keywords: — Bus rollover, Occupant safety, AIS- 031, Numerical simulation, RADIOSS I...|$|E

40|$|The Abstract Schema Language (ASL) {{defines a}} {{hierarchical}} computational {{model for the}} development of distributed heterogeneous systems. ASL extends the capabilities and methodologies of concurrent object-oriented programming to enable the construction of highly complex multi-granular systems. The ASL model is described in terms of schemas (concurrent objects), supporting aggregation (schema assemblages), and both top-down and bottom-up system designs. ASL encourages code reusability by enabling the integration of heterogeneous components, e. g., procedural and neural network programs. ASL schemas are designed and implemented in an orthogonal fashion; integrated, either statically, through wrapping, or dynamically, via (task) delegation. Schemas include a dynamic interface, made of multiple unidirectional input and output ports, and <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>section</b> where schema behavior is specified.

40|$|The Abstract Schema Language (ASL) [Weitzenfeld 1992; Weitzenfeld and Arbib 1992] unifies schema {{modeling}} [Arbib 1992] with concurrent {{object-oriented programming}} (COOP). ASL extends {{the current state}} of the art in both areas by providing a hierarchical approach towards heterogeneous and multi-granular concurrent object design. Schemas in ASL are functional units which get implemented in an orthogonal fashion. This aspect not only encourages code reusability, but enables schema implementations as, e. g., procedural programs or neural network processes. ASL addresses the need to separate task specification from actual task implementation, by utilizing the concept of dynamic task delegation and static wrapping of external programs. ASL schemas define class templates from which active objects get dynamically instantiated. Schemas incorporate a dynamic interface made of multiple input and output ports, plus <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>section</b> which explicitly specifies the schema behavior.

30|$|An {{important}} factor {{for a medical}} system using software and hardware from different manufactures is the data exchange. To have the intraoperative patient data immediately available in iGyne the DICOM listener from Slicer has been used. Thus, the patient acquisitions could be pushed automatically from the scanner to iGyne for further processing (e.g. Linking and Contouring). However, for an intraoperative navigation or guidance of catheter placement a more sophisticated solution is needed, where a navigation system or ultrasound is integrated into the whole system. This can be realized via the OpenIGTLink network protocol developed at the BWH (Tokuda et al. 2010). OpenIGTLink is a new, open, simple and extensible peer-to-peer network communication protocol for IGT which has already been used successfully for prostate interventions (Tokuda et al. 2008). The protocol provides a standardized mechanism to connect hardware and software by the transfer of coordinate transforms, images, and status messages. The advantage of OpenIGTLink is its simple specification, initially developed through a collaboration of academic, clinical and industrial partners for developing an integrated robotic system for MRI-guided prostate interventions (Fischer et al. 2008). It was designed {{for use in the}} application layer on the TCP/IP stack, allowing researchers to develop a prototype system that integrates multiple medical devices using the standard network infrastructure (Egger et al. 2012 d). The OpenIGTLink protocol itself does not include mechanisms to establish and manage a session. It only defines a set of messages, which is the minimum data unit of this protocol. In Summary, an OpenIGTLink message contains all information necessary for interpretation by the receiver and begins with a 58 -byte header section, which is common to all types of data, followed by <b>a</b> <b>body</b> <b>section.</b> The format of the body section varies by the data type that is specified in the header section. Since any compatible receiver can interpret the header section, which contains the size and the data type of the body, every receiver can gracefully handle any message, even those with an unknown data type, by ignoring incompatible messages without the system crashing.|$|E

Embodied machines have the unique capability to sense human body language, which will enable robots to better comprehend, anticipate and respond to their human companions in a natural way. This thesis addresses the novel field of sensate touch by (1) creating the first. robot with full Body sensate touch and with on-screen visualization, (2) establishing a library of salient social gestures through behavioral studies, (3) implementing a first-pass touch gesture recognition system in real-time, an(d (4) running a small pilot study with children to evaluate classifications and test the device's acceptance/utility with humans. Such research is critical path to conceiving and advancing thee use of machine touch to better integrate robots in. to human social environments.
