5|$|In Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī's (973–1048) Shadows, {{non-uniform}} {{motion is}} described {{as the result of}} <b>acceleration.</b> Ibn-Sina's theory of mayl tried to relate the velocity and weight of a moving object, a precursor of the concept of momentum. Aristotle's theory of motion stated that a constant force produces a uniform motion; Abu'l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī (c. 1080 – 1164/5) disagreed, arguing that velocity and <b>acceleration</b> are two different things, and that force is proportional to <b>acceleration,</b> not to velocity.|$|E

30|$|The non-gravitational <b>accelerations</b> from POD {{are not yet}} {{optimized}} for Swarm. Improvements in their determination will facilitate the calibration of the step-corrected <b>accelerations</b> and directly improve the merged <b>accelerations.</b>|$|R

5|$|Analysis of the {{spectrum}} can also reveal the surface gravity of the star. This is usually expressed as log g, the base-10 logarithm of the gravitational <b>acceleration</b> given in CGS units, in this case, cm/s². Beta Pictoris has logg=4.15, implying a surface gravity of 140 m/s², which is {{about half of the}} gravitational <b>acceleration</b> at the surface of the Sun (274m/s²).|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{characters}} are playable in Crash Team Racing, although only {{eight of them}} are playable from the start. Crash Bandicoot, the main protagonist of the series, is an all-round racer with balanced <b>acceleration,</b> top speed and handling. Doctor Neo Cortex, Crash's archenemy, is a mad scientist who wants to stop Nitros Oxide so that he may conquer the world himself. Like Crash, his kart is an all-round performer. Coco Bandicoot, Crash's younger sister, is a computer genius who installed computer chips into her kart to increase its <b>acceleration</b> prowess. Doctor N. Gin is a rocket scientist who, like Coco, added custom parts to his kart to improve its <b>acceleration.</b> Pura and Polar pilot karts with low speed but improved handling, allowing them to navigate tight corners. Tiny Tiger and Dingodile control karts built for top speed {{at the cost of}} turning prowess.|$|E
30|$|Both {{types of}} <b>accelerations</b> are {{differently}} sampled. Since the signal-to-noise {{ratio of the}} calibrated <b>accelerations</b> is poor at higher frequencies, we decimate those to a sampling rate of 0.1 Hz after applying a 31 -s moving-median filter for antialiasing and outlier rejection. The non-gravitational <b>accelerations</b> from POD are linearly interpolated to the epochs of the decimated <b>accelerations.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{accelerometer}} {{will therefore}} {{be sensitive to}} <b>accelerations</b> due to the gravity gradient between {{the center of the}} accelerometer proof mass and the satellite center of mass, {{as well as to the}} centrifugal <b>accelerations</b> due to the satellite rotation, which we need to account for. Since the reference <b>accelerations</b> obtained from GPS tracking do not contain the influence of these <b>accelerations,</b> we have to remove them beforehand.|$|R
30|$|As {{explained}} in Subsection 3.1, a highly-reduced dynamic POD is conducted using the best gravitational force models {{in order to}} estimate time series of non-gravitational <b>accelerations.</b> The current setup allows the estimation of piecewise linear <b>accelerations</b> with a 15 min time interval between the nodes. These <b>accelerations</b> are used for comparison and validation of the calibrated observed <b>accelerations.</b> Such a comparison is displayed in Fig. 5, which includes not only these estimated non-gravitational <b>accelerations,</b> but also those predicted by models and the calibrated observed <b>accelerations.</b> For the X axis, {{the size of the}} variations of the calibrated observed <b>accelerations</b> matches well with that of the estimated <b>accelerations.</b> The variations of the modeled non-gravitational <b>accelerations</b> appear to have a higher amplitude, which is an indication that the selected aerodynamic model overestimates the neutral density. The latter will be addressed further below. For the Y axis, it can be observed that the variations between modeled <b>accelerations</b> {{on the one hand and}} estimated and calibrated observed <b>accelerations</b> on the other hand match quite well, but that a significant mean offset is present. The latter reflects again the uncertainty of the biases estimated by POD for this direction. Moreover, for GRACE-A it can be observed that for the Z axis the variations also match quite well for all time series, apart from the estimated ones for which it is known that they cannot be determined very well by POD (van den IJssel and Visser, 2004 a, b).|$|R
5|$|The braking a is from {{an initial}} speed u {{to a final}} speed v, over a length of time t. The {{equation}} u - v = at implies that the greater the <b>acceleration</b> the shorter {{the time needed to}} change speed. The stopping distance s is also shortest when <b>acceleration</b> a is at the highest possible value compatible with road conditions: the equation s = ut + 1/2 at2 makes s low when a is high and t is low.|$|E

5|$|These flights covered {{performance}} tests {{such as we}} do on planes undergoing Navy tests. The very first flight exposed weaknesses of the Zero which our pilots could exploit with proper tactics... immediately apparent {{was the fact that}} the ailerons froze up at speeds above 200 knots so that rolling maneuvers at those speeds were slow and required much force on the control stick. It rolled to the left much easier than to the right. Also, its engine cut out under negative <b>acceleration</b> due to its float-type carburetor. We now had the answer for our pilots who were being outmaneuvered and unable to escape a pursuing Zero: Go into a vertical power dive, using negative <b>acceleration</b> if possible to open the range while the Zero's engine was stopped by the <b>acceleration.</b> At about 200 knots, roll hard right before the Zero pilot could get his sights lined up.|$|E

30|$|The {{phase and}} {{amplitude}} of the orbital signal {{in the raw}} <b>accelerations</b> is heavily perturbed by the temperature-dependent bias. We fully rely {{on the quality of}} the <b>accelerations</b> from POD for finding a good temperature correction. However, the orbital signal and its first harmonic are at the limit of the time resolution that the <b>accelerations</b> from POD provide. This leads sometimes to unwanted effects like the positive <b>accelerations</b> shown in Fig.  10 and discussed in “Estimation procedure” section. We expect that an optimization of the processing of <b>accelerations</b> from POD for Swarm will improve the situation.|$|R

40|$|Data {{obtained}} by NASA VGH and V-G recorders on several Lockheed Electra airplanes operated over three domestic routes have been analyzed {{to determine the}} in-flight <b>accelerations,</b> airspeed practices, and landing <b>accelerations</b> experienced by this particular airplane. The {{results indicate that the}} <b>accelerations</b> caused by gusts and maneuvers are comparable to corresponding results for piston-engine transport airplanes. Oscillatory <b>accelerations</b> (apparently caused by the autopilot or control system) appear to occur about one-tenth as frequently as <b>accelerations</b> due to gusts. Airspeed operating practices in rough air generally follow the trends shown by piston-engine transports in that there is {{no significant difference between the}} average airspeed in rough or smooth air. Placard speeds were exceeded more frequently by the Electra airplane than by piston-engine transport airplanes. Generally, the landing-impact <b>accelerations</b> were higher than those for piston-engine transports...|$|R
25|$|In {{non-uniform}} {{circular motion}} the net <b>acceleration</b> (a) is along direction of Δv which is directed inside circle {{but does not}} pass through its center (see figure).

25|$|The <b>acceleration</b> vector of the parcel is {{decomposed}} in the tangential <b>acceleration</b> {{parallel to}} s {{and in the}} centripetal <b>acceleration</b> along positive n.

40|$|Objectives To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} BMX helmets and neck braces on translational and rotational <b>accelerations</b> in youth riders. Design Mixed model, repeated measure and correlation. Methods Twenty three competitive youth BMX riders classified by age group (6 - 9 yrs, 10 - 13 yrs and 14 - 18 yrs) completed 6 laps of an indoor BMX track at race pace, 3 laps without a neck brace (NB) and 3 without brace (WB). A triaxial accelerometer with gyroscope was placed behind the right ear to determine {{the mean number of}} <b>accelerations,</b> translational and rotational, of the head between conditions and by age group. Results Significant reductions by condition (p = 0. 02) and by age (p = 0. 04) were found for the number of <b>accelerations,</b> though no interactions (condition x age) were revealed. Significant increases by age (p = 0. 01) were revealed for translational <b>accelerations,</b> whilst significant increases by condition (p = 0. 02) were found for rotational <b>accelerations.</b> In addition, significant correlations were revealed between relative helmet mass and age (r = 0. 83; p 0. 001) and relative helmet mass and number of <b>accelerations</b> (r = 0. 46; p = 0. 03). Conclusions <b>Accelerations</b> at the head decreased with increased age, possibly due to the influence of greater stabilising musculature. Additionally, neck braces also significantly reduced the number of <b>accelerations.</b> However, the magnitude of <b>accelerations</b> may be influenced by riding dynamics. Therefore, the use of neck braces combined with strength work to develop neck strength, could aid in the reduction of head <b>accelerations</b> in youth BMX riders...|$|R
30|$|In the {{top right}} panel of Fig.  10, we show the {{comparison}} for March 16 – 19, 2015, {{which is the}} time when the St. Patrick’s day geomagnetic storm occurred. We highlight the very good agreement between the calibrated and corrected <b>accelerations</b> and the <b>accelerations</b> from POD for the large-scale signal structure, where the <b>accelerations</b> drop from − 200 to − 700  nm/s^ 2 during half a day and then increase again to − 200  nm/s^ 2 during a bit more than one day. For the finer signal structures, we see differences up to 800  nm/s^ 2 between calibrated and corrected <b>accelerations</b> and the <b>accelerations</b> from POD. This is shown in more detail in the bottom left panel of Fig.  10, which zooms in on 12 : 00 – 18 : 00  UTC on March 17, 2015, where we can see that the difference are due to short and strong negative <b>accelerations</b> that are not well captured in the <b>accelerations</b> from POD due to their 10 -min time resolution.|$|R

25|$|Figure 1 {{illustrates}} {{velocity and}} <b>acceleration</b> vectors for uniform motion at four {{different points in}} the orbit. Because the velocity v is tangent to the circular path, no two velocities point in the same direction. Although the object has a constant speed, its direction is always changing. This change in velocity is caused by an <b>acceleration</b> a, whose magnitude is (like that of the velocity) held constant, but whose direction also is always changing. The <b>acceleration</b> points radially inwards (centripetally) and is perpendicular to the velocity. This <b>acceleration</b> is known as centripetal <b>acceleration.</b>|$|E
30|$|Generally, the {{accuracy}} of the estimated non-gravitational <b>accelerations</b> is highest for the x axis (≈ along-track direction) due to the strong effect of <b>accelerations</b> in flight direction on orbital dynamics. Predominantly, the longer wavelengths are well determined and high-frequency <b>accelerations,</b> e.g., caused by geomagnetic storms, are less well recovered (van den IJssel and Visser 2007).|$|R

40|$|To {{characterize}} the low-gravity environment within orbiting space laboratories, researchers are operating sensitive accelerometer systems.
