500|$|Upon her arrival, Marie {{was welcomed}} enthusiastically by the American people, with [...] "whistle of steamers, roar of guns in white smoke puffs against gray fog, voices cheering in a {{stinging}} rain". She was formally greeted by Jimmy Walker, the serving Mayor of New York City. Constance Lily Morris, author of On Tour with Queen Marie, {{wrote that the}} people were excited for Marie's arrival mainly because of her almost mythical allure, which had been created by papers and rumour throughout her life; she observed that [...] "the modest Queen of the Belgians [...] had once come with her king for a brief visit <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> the dusky Hawaiian ruler had honored us, {{but there had been}} no others. The time could not have been better set." [...] Marie was also fairly popular within suffragette circles, where she was viewed as [...] "a woman whose wits had devised many a coup d'Ã©tat, whose brains had thought out many a difficult problem for her people, who had used the gifts given her to further every good purpose".|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Beckinsale {{starred in}} the comic-book {{adaption}} Whiteout as a U.S.Marshal tasked with investigating a murder in Antarctica. It was filmed in Manitoba, Canada. She found the action scenes less physically demanding than those in Underworld because [...] "three pairs of trousers and a parka gives you a bit more protection than the latex suit." [...] The film was critically panned and a box office failure, failing to recoup its budget. With critics consensus: Beckinsale is the lovely as ever, and does her best with the material, but moribund pacing and an uninspired plot leave Whiteout in the cold. She also made a brief cameo in the prequel she appeared in flashforwards composed of footage from 2003's Underworld. Also in 2009, Beckinsale {{starred in the}} family drama Everybody's Fine alongside Robert De Niro, Drew Barrymore, and Rockwell, her Snow Angels co-star. Beckinsale was excited by {{the opportunity to work}} with De Niro, whom she had first encountered [...] "years <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> when I just had Lily and he was putting together a reading of The Good Shepherd.". Everybody's Fine was a box office flop, failing to recoup its production budget. In May 2010, Beckinsale sat on the nine-member 2010 Cannes Film Festival jury, chaired by director Tim Burton. Unable to find a script she felt passionate about, Beckinsale kept a low profile in 2010 and 2011, opting to spend time with her daughter.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the podium}} {{ceremony}} following the race, Rosberg was booed by the crowd, mirroring a similar incident towards {{him at the}} previous race in Belgium. Hamilton later told the press {{that he did not}} feel comfortable about the fans behaving in such a manner: [...] "I've had it here, years <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> and it's great personally for me to have such great support, from the Ferrari fans and the Mercedes fans. But when I was up there, it was awkward for me to hear them booing Nico because I just don't like that in sport." [...] Wolff affirmed that booing should not be heard on the podium but acknowledged Formula One is an emotional sport for its fan base while also saying: [...] "It's a sport and sport should unite." [...] When asked about the booing in the press conference, Rosberg replied while it was [...] "not nice" [...] he hoped over time the fans would forgive him for his past actions. In the podium interviews, conducted by former driver Jean Alesi, Massa expressed his happiness on standing on the podium and was certain luck was beside him and that there was [...] "a lot more to come." ...|$|E

Further, last glacial maximum highstands of Lake Manly appear to precede highstands of Lake Lahontan and Lake Bonneville, probably due to a northward shift of the jet stream.|$|R
