It reached an agreement with the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB) in 1858 to use its West End and Crystal Palace line to access Battersea and (from 1860) Victoria. This arrangement incurred costly <b>access</b> <b>fees,</b> but it was necessary until the company obtained Parliamentary authority to build in London.|$|E

The government committed $200 million of taxpayer funding on deferred maintenance and capital improvements via a new subsidiary of the New Zealand Railways Corporation, ONTRACK.

40|$|Network {{shares and}} retail prices are not {{symmetric}} in the telecommunications market with multiple bottlenecks which {{give rise to}} new questions of <b>access</b> <b>fee</b> regulation. In this paper we consider a model with two types of asymmetry arising from different entry timing, i. e. a larger reputation for the incumbent and lower cost of servicing for the entrant {{as a result of}} more advanced technology. As a result firms have divergent preferences over the <b>access</b> <b>fee.</b> In case of linear and non-linear prices the <b>access</b> <b>fee</b> might still act as the instrument of collusion, but only if a side-payment is permitted which is generally welfare decreasing.

25|$|In {{recent years}} {{attempts}} have been made to run shuttles between the Port of Melbourne and inland ports. Between 2003 and 2006 CRT Group operated a shuttle to their terminal at Altona, 22 kilometers from the docks. In 2004/05, the service transported 13,000 TEU, this being 42 per cent capacity for import and 58 per cent for export containers. The service ceased due to high <b>access</b> <b>fees</b> charged by track operator ARTC, and delays by interstate freight trains sharing the same track making the reliable operation of two trips per day impossible. The service restarted in 2005, but failed for the same reasons. A second port shuttle has operated to the Austrack terminal at Somerton during various periods since 1998, with difficulties faced including inefficient track layouts, high rail transfer charges at the port, and inconvenient timetables dictated by long distance freight services.|$|E
2500|$|MasterCard, {{along with}} Visa, has been sued {{in a class}} action by ATM {{operators}} that claims the credit card networks' rules effectively fix ATM <b>access</b> <b>fees.</b> The suit claims {{that this is a}} restraint on trade in violation of federal law.

The suit says that this price fixing artificially raises the price that consumers pay using ATMs, limits the revenue that ATM-operators earn, and violates the Sherman Act's prohibition against unreasonable restraints of trade.

In {{a case of}} any linear or log-linear electricity demand function with a positive probability that no congestion occurs, average revenue regulation is allocatively more efficient than a Coasian two-part tariff if a positive <b>access</b> <b>fee</b> under average revenue regulation is lower than that under a Coasian two-part tariff. congestion pricing; electric power transmission; two-part tariff; average revenue regulation; Coasian two-part tariff...|$|R
