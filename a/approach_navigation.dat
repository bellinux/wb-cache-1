Existing approaches assume that an appropriately detailed and accurate metric map can be obtained through sensing the environment. Even landmark-based <b>navigation</b> <b>approaches</b> assume unrealistically (except if a GPS system is available) accurate distance and direction information between the robot and the landmarks (see Section 6).

We describe {{in this paper}} a system designed to simulate pedestrian behaviour in crowds in real time, concentrating particularity on collision avoidance. On-line planning is also referred as the navigation problem. Additional difficulties in <b>approaching</b> <b>navigation</b> problem are that some environments are dynamic. In our model we adopted a popular methodology in computer games, namely A* algorithm. The idea behind A* {{is to look for}} the shortest possible routes to the destination not through exploring exhaustively all the possible combination but utilizing all the possible directions at any given point. The environment is formed in regions and the algorithm is used to find a path only in visual region. In order to deal with collision avoidance, priority rules are given to some entities as well as some social behaviour...|$|R

While recent games solve increasingly complex and specific navigation problems, the documented <b>approaches</b> to <b>navigation</b> remain primitive and isolated within the gaming software realm. We propose a semantic <b>approach</b> to <b>navigation</b> that allows AI to extract and incorporate a wide variety of navigation information into the planning of character behavior, including raw geometry, strategic objects, and abilities for locomotion. We design and implement a navigation system for Unreal Engine 3 that requires little designer intervention, has a rich interface for AI programmers, and can be extended with other types of semantic information. This subsystem proves to outperform the original navigation functionality by delivering more natural paths, fewer world annotation, and dynamic re-planning.

40|$|Spatial {{cognition}} {{and program}} development {{have both been}} examined using contrasting models. We suggest that sex-based differences in one’s perception of risk {{is the key to}} relating these models. Specifically, the survey map <b>approach</b> to <b>navigation</b> and the top-down development/comprehension strategy use similar and related high risk cognitive skills that males show a preference towards. Conversely, the route-based <b>approach</b> to <b>navigation</b> and the bottom-up development/comprehension strategy use similar and related low risk cognitive skills that women show a preference towards. On the assumption that programmers are consistent in their risk-taking behaviours, we believe that they will, as much as possible, tend to use the same strategy when performing program development and comprehension. In an experimental setting, we compare programmer’s performance on spatial cognition and program comprehension tasks. The correlations that we found suggest that programmers use equivalently risky strategies for program comprehension and spatial cognition. Thus, there is evidence that similar cognitive skills are used for spatial cognition and program comprehension/development, and that the similarities are a consequence of sex-based differences in risk-taking behaviour. ...|$|R
