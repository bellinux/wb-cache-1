40|$|In the {{economic}} evaluation of large public-sector projects, an aggregate {{social discount rate}} {{may be used in}} present worth comparison of alternatives. This paper uses the assumptions that individual discount rates are constant over time and approximately Normally distributed across the affected population, with mean μ and variance σ 2, to derive an <b>aggregate</b> <b>discount</b> function that is exponential in form but with time-dependent <b>aggregate</b> <b>discount</b> rate ρ (t) = μ - σ 2 t/ 2, where t is the time of occurrence of the cost or benefit. This equation agrees with numerical simulations. If σ 2 > 0, then the <b>aggregate</b> <b>discount</b> rate is less than the mean individual discount rate, and use of the time-dependent <b>aggregate</b> <b>discount</b> rate ρ (t) = μ - σ 2 t/ 2 instead of the constant discount factor ρ (t) = μ would result in larger discounted present values for public-sector projects for which the benefits lie far in the future.

The equilibrium time variation in the <b>aggregate</b> <b>discount</b> combines with the dynamics of cash ßows to yield a number of predictions about the time series of the cross section of asset prices. We show that assets of longer duration, i. e. that pay far in the future, are typically riskier than those of shorter duration. However, those assets that are characterized by a substantial cash ßow risk — that is, whose payoffs havehigh covariance with consumption growth — are riskier when they have shorter duration. In addition, we show that the time variation in the <b>aggregate</b> <b>discount</b> tends to generate a negative correlation between the cross sectional dispersion of price dividend ratios — which is procyclical — and the dispersion of market betas — which is countercyclical.

40|$|I {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of asset prices in an economy in which investors choose whether to hold diversified or concentrated portfolios of risky assets. The latter are valuable, as they increase the productivity of the corresponding enterprises. I capture the tradeoff between risk sharing and productivity gains by introducing what I call “active capital”: people who participate in such investments are restricted in their outside opportunities but receive extra compensation. In equilibrium, active and standard capital coexist. The willingness to provide active capital is mainly determined by risk considerations. Therefore, the quantity of active capital fluctuates jointly with risk premia, amplifying their variations. As a consequence, the price of volatility risk exposure can be large and return volatility is mainly induced by fluctuations in future expected returns. These results are particularly strong when fundamental volatility is low, because at such time, {{a large number of}} concentrated owners are likely to exit their positions and sell off their assets.

40|$|In {{insurance}} risk theory, dividend and aggregate claim amount are of great research interest as {{they represent the}} insurance company's payments to its shareholders and policyholders respectively. Since the analyses of these two quantities are performed separately in the literature, the companion paper Cheung et al. (2015) generalized the Gerber-Shiu expected discounted penalty function (Gerber and Shiu (1998)) by further incorporating the moments of the <b>aggregate</b> <b>discounted</b> claims until ruin and the discounted dividends until ruin. While Cheung et al. (2015) considered the compound Poisson model with a dividend barrier in which ruin occurs almost surely, the present paper looks at this generalized Gerber-Shiu function under a threshold dividend strategy where the insurer has a positive survival probability. Because the Gerber-Shiu function is only defined for sample paths leading to ruin, we will additionally study the joint moments of the <b>aggregate</b> <b>discounted</b> claims and the discounted dividends without ruin occurring. Some explicit formulas are derived when the individual claim distribution follows a combination of exponentials.

40|$|This paper empirically investigates how {{banks of}} varying size invest an {{unsolicited}} inflow of deposits over the business cycle. I generate exogenous shocks to bank deposits by exploiting {{the development of}} new oil and gas fields using ‘fracking’ technologies that result in significant cash windfalls to landowners and large increases in local deposits. I compare the investment decisions of small- and medium-sized banks in response to these shocks and find that in normal times both types lend in response to a supply shock. The composition of their lending portfolio varies, with smaller banks investing more in ‘soft ’ information intensive assets relative to larger banks. However, during the financial crisis small banks invest significantly less of their incremental deposits in loans, purchasing liquid assets instead. My findings suggest that during adverse times, even in a developed economy like the U. S., capital may become trapped inside several small banks.

40|$|A large {{literature}} examines energy-efficiency investments {{by consumers}} and firms, partic-ularly {{evaluation of the}} extent of and expla-nations for an “energy efficiency (EE) gap ” (Gerarden, Newell, and Stavins 2015). But prior studies have not considered the role of individ-ual discount rates in such decisions. Instead, most assessments assume a certain discount rate against which the rationality of observed choices is gauged (Allcott and Wozny 2014), or alternatively, estimate <b>aggregate</b> <b>discount</b> rates that best match observed EE decisions, condi-tional on an assumed decision model (Hausman 1979). The absence of evidence on the role of indi-vidual discount rates is surprising because the profitability of EE investments depends fun-damentally on the rate at which individuals discount future energy savings relative to the required upfront investment. The potential importance of individual discount rates is further heightened by findings in experimental studies that elicited time preferences exhibit consider-able heterogeneity (Frederick, Loewenstein, and O’Donoghue 2002). This paper broadly examines the role of indi-vidual discount rates in EE decisions. Our ear-lier findings on information provision (Newell and Siikamäki 2014 —henceforth, NS) indicate that the efficacy of alternative labels in guiding cost-efficient decisions depends critically on the discount rate used for analysis.

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effects of Swedish and Scandinavian investor sentiment on the net asset value discounts of closed-end investment companies. While previous studies have linked sentiment to discounts, both Scandinavian and Swedish evidence is lacking. The study contributes to existing literature by further developing the methodology by Baker & Wurgler (2006) to examine the investor sentiment effect brought forward by Lee et al. (1991) in a Scandinavian setting. In particular, this study offers additional evidence to Hjelström (2007) regarding the <b>aggregate</b> <b>discounts</b> of closed-end investment companies in Swedish capital markets. Unlike previous studies, I provide evidence on individual investment companies and consider both regional and local sentiment as an explanatory factor. DATA The investor sentiment data set covers quarterly data for stock mutual fund inflows, trading volume for aggregate equity markets, and the number and first-day returns of all main-list IPOs within the time period of 1. 1. 1999 to 31. 3. 2011 separately for Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway. The net asset value data set covers 854 quarter-end net asset value discounts (or premiums) of 20 closed-end investment companies during the same time period. Both of the novel datasets were manually collected from multiple sources. RESULTS My main findings indicate that the aggregate net asset value discount of closed-end investment companies is not a sentiment indicator. I show that investor sentiment does not affect <b>aggregate</b> <b>discounts</b> but rather affects the discounts of individual closed-end investment companies. Furthermore, sentiment affects the discounts of individual investment companies in conflicting ways (i. e. positive sentiment can either increase or decrease discounts). Finally, I find evidence indicating that discounts of individual investment companies do not exhibit correlation, and that the strength of the sentiment effect varies substantially between different types of individual investment companies.

Conclusion [...] Appendices. This PhD thesis seeks to offer a new framework that accommodates dependency in pricing an insurance portfolio following the renewal risk model, corporate bonds, as well as credit default swaps (CDS). This will be achieved by combining the approach and methodology of actuarial science with stochastic processes and probability theories, as well as employing {{a hint of the}} integral calculus used in the electromagnetic and viscoelasticity fields. This thesis is a collection of three papers, which are presented in Chapters 2, 3 and 4. While Chapters 3 and 4 can be read in conjunction with each other, Chapter 2 can be read in isolation because it presents a completely different perspective of insurance to the financial perspective taken in the other two articles (Chapter 3 and 4). Nevertheless, the three papers share the same scope, which is the use of copula to capture the dependency between variables. In total, four copulas are explored: the Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern (FGM) copula, Gumbel copula, Gaussian copula and Student-t copula. However, only three copulas are compared in each working paper. The first article in Chapter 2 models a continuous time renewal risk process, and uses copulas to capture the dependence structure between the claims inter-arrival time and discounted claims size. The second and third articles work under the framework of a reduced form model and use various copulas to capture the dependence structure between the jump sizes of the intensity processes, each of which is represented by a jump diffusion process. Taking the insurance perspective, the first article - titled Neumann Series on the Recursive Moments of Copula-Dependent <b>Aggregate</b> <b>Discounted</b> Claims - studies the recursive moments of <b>aggregate</b> <b>discounted</b> claims, where the dependence between the interclaim time and the subsequent claim size is considered. Using the general expression for the mth order moment proposed in [1] which takes the form of the Volterra Integral Equation (VIE), we used the method of successive approximation to derive the Neumann series of the recursive moments. We then compute the first two moments of <b>aggregate</b> <b>discounted</b> claims, i. e. its mean and variance, based on the Neumann series expression where the dependence structure is captured by the FGM copula, Gaussian copula and Gumbel copula, with exponential marginal distributions. Insurance premium calculations with their figures are also illustrated. The second work – titled A multivariate jump diffusion process for counterparty risk in CDS rates – considers counterparty risk in CDS rates. To do so, it uses a multivariate jump diffusion process for obligors’ default intensity, where jumps (i. e. magnitude of contribution of primary events to default intensities) occur simultaneously and their sizes are dependent. For these simultaneous jumps and their sizes, a homogeneous Poisson process and three copulas, which are Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern (FGM), Gaussian and Student-t copulas are used. This project applies copula-dependent default intensities of multivariate Cox process to derive the joint Laplace transform that provides us with joint survival/default probability and other relevant joint probabilities. For that purpose, the piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP) theory developed in [2] and the martingale methodology in [3] are used. The survival/default probability is computed using the three copulas and exponential marginal distributions, and the results are applied to calculate CDS rates, assuming deterministic rate of interest and recovery rate. Sensitivity analysis for the CDS rates were also conducted by changing the relevant parameters and providing their figures. The final article – titled Jump diffusion model with copula dependence structure in defaultable bond pricing – studies the pricing of a defaultable bond under various copulas. For that purpose, it used a bivariate jump diffusion process for a bond issuer’s default intensity and the short rate of interest. We assume the jumps (i. e. magnitude of contribution of primary events to default intensities) occur simultaneously and their sizes are dependent. For these simultaneous jumps and their sizes, a homogeneous Poisson process and three copulas – FGM copula, Gaussian copula and Student-t copula are used, respectively. The joint Laplace transform for the variables’ integrated processes is derived to provide the expression for defaultable bond price, using copula-dependent jump sizes. Once again, we apply the piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP) theory developed in [2] and the martingale methodology in [3]. Zero coupon defaultable bond prices and their yield are computed using the three copulas and exponential marginal distributions. The model is then used to calibrate zero coupon bonds on one-day basis as well as {{for an extended period of}} one year. Calibration results show that the Student-t copula provides the best fit relative to the other two copulas.

Gerber and Shiu (1998) proposed the well-known Gerber-Shiu expected discounted penalty function or Gerber-Shiu function which unifies the study of three key ruin quantities, namely the time of ruin, the surplus just before ruin and the deficit at ruin. In this thesis, we further incorporate the <b>discounted</b> <b>aggregate</b> claim costs until ruin as well as the <b>discounted</b> <b>aggregate</b> dividends until ruin if any dividend strategy is implemented into the Gerber-Shiu function. The generalized Gerber-Shiu function is examined under the compound Poisson model with a barrier dividend strategy or a threshold dividend strategy and a risk model with 2 -sided jumps. In a risk model with a barrier dividend strategy or a threshold dividend strategy, dividends are paid to shareholder whenever the surplus reaches a predetermined level. The dividends and the claims can be deemed as the payments to the shareholders and policyholders, respectively. As it will be seen in this thesis, if the cost function is specified, the generalized Gerber-Shiu function allows us study the time of ruin, the discounted total dividends until ruin and the <b>discounted</b> <b>aggregate</b> claims until ruin at the same time. Numerical examples are also provided to illustrate the relationship between these quantities. In traditional risk models, insurance companies are assumed to receive premiums at a constant rate. However, some premiums are paid in lump sums, such as insurances of traveling art collections. The assumptions in a risk model with 2 -sided jumps are more realistic in this regard since the upward jumps represent the random premiums. To separate the contributions of random gains and losses, both the <b>discounted</b> <b>aggregate</b> downward jump `costs' until ruin and the <b>discounted</b> <b>aggregate</b> upward jump `costs' until ruin are incorporated into the Gerber-Shiu function. Aside from the general analysis of the generalized Gerber-Shiu function, explicit solutions of two special cases under specific downward jump distribution assumptions are derived along with numerical illustrations related to the first case. published_or_final_versionStatistics and Actuarial ScienceMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

The criterion analysed {{here is the}} maximisation of <b>aggregate</b> <b>discounted</b> cash flows from the contractor’s perspective, known as an RCPSP problem with Discounted Cash Flows (RCPSPDCF). The cash flows analysed here cover the contractor’s cash outflows (negative cash flows), related to the commencement of individual activities, and cash inflows (positive cash flows) after the fulfilment of individual milestones. The authors propose a two-phase algorithm for solving the problem defined. In the first phase, the simulated annealing metaheuristics is used, designed to identify a forward schedule with as high total DCF as possible. In the second phase, the best first-phase schedule is improved by right shifts of activities. To this end, the procedure which iteratively shifts tasks by one unit is applied, {{with a view to}} maximising the objective function. Activity shifts take into consideration precedence and resource constraints, and they are performed for a specified resource allocation to activities. This paper also includes an analysis of the problem for a sample project. The results of computational experiments are then analysed.
