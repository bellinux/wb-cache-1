5|$|Garfield lingered for two-and-a-half {{months before}} dying on September 19, 1881. Vice President Chester A. Arthur, the New York Stalwart, {{was sworn in}} as {{president}} that night. Garfield's murder by a spoilsman inspired the nation to reform the civil service—and Arthur, erstwhile member of the Conkling machine, joined the cause. In 1883, <b>a</b> <b>bipartisan</b> majority in Congress passed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act to reform the worst of the office-seeking system, and Arthur signed the measure into law.|$|E
5|$|In early 2014, President Barack Obama {{nominated}} Debo P. Adegbile, {{a former}} {{lawyer for the}} NAACP who worked on Abu-Jamal's case, to head the civil rights division of the Justice Department, but the nomination {{was rejected by the}} U.S. Senate on <b>a</b> <b>bipartisan</b> basis because of Adegbile's prior public support of Abu-Jamal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the storm, Congress appointed <b>a</b> <b>bipartisan</b> committee to investigate the response to Hurricane Katrina and the preparations prior to its landfall. The committee concluded that the forecasts given by the National Weather Service were timely, were not responsible for failures in other agencies, and were likely responsible for saving thousands of lives that would have otherwise {{been lost in the}} raging hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Rice also {{hoped to}} sponsor {{legislation}} supported by Ritter to raise vehicle registration fees {{in order to}} fund road and bridge repairs, but failed to find a suitable cosponsor for the bill. Late in the session, though, Rice signed on as House sponsor on a measure to raise registration and rental fees to create trust funds for transportation; the measure was later dropped in favor of <b>a</b> <b>bipartisan</b> study committee between legislative sessions.|$|E
5|$|The 2016–17 budget {{forecasts}} that defence expenditure will increase to $39.3 billion in 2019–20, which {{is estimated to}} represent 1.97% of GDP. This reflects <b>a</b> <b>bipartisan</b> commitment to increase defence expenditure to 2% of GDP. The 2016 Defence White Paper included a commitment to further increases in spending beyond this time, with nominal expenditure being projected to be around $58.8 billion in 2020–25; the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has estimated that this would represent about 2.16% of GDP.|$|E

5|$|When {{a federal}} court {{released}} former Confederate president Davis on bail on May 13 (he had been captured shortly after the war), the committee investigated whether the President had impeded the prosecution. It learned that Johnson was eager to have Davis tried. <b>A</b> <b>bipartisan</b> majority of the committee voted down impeachment charges; the committee adjourned on June 3.|$|E
5|$|After President Nixon {{was elected}} in November 1968, Ford's role shifted to being an {{advocate}} for the White House agenda. Congress passed several of Nixon's proposals, including the National Environmental Policy Act and the Tax Reform Act of 1969. Another high-profile victory for the Republican minority was the State and Local Fiscal Assistance act. Passed in 1972, the act established a Revenue Sharing program {{for state and local}} governments. Ford's leadership was instrumental in shepherding revenue sharing through Congress, and resulted in <b>a</b> <b>bipartisan</b> coalition that supported the bill with 223 votes in favor (compared with 185 against).|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} United Farm Workers, Itliong {{assisted}} retired Filipino farmworkers in Delano, {{and was a}} delegate at the 1972 Democratic National Convention. Together with Vera Cruz, Itliong worked towards building a retirement facility for UFW workers, known as Agbayani Village. Although {{no longer in the}} United Farm Workers, Itliong continued to support others in the organized labor movement, such as helping others plan a strike against Safeway supermarkets in 1974. Itliong also served as President of the Filipino American Political Association, <b>a</b> <b>bipartisan</b> lobbying organization. He died in 1977 at the age of 63 in Delano of Lou Gehrig's disease.|$|E
40|$|<b>As</b> <b>bipartisan</b> {{supporters}} of the Republic of Georgia's aspirations to become a fully functioning, Western-oriented democracy, we have followed with dismay the increasingly unproductive "dialogue" attendant to demonstrations against the current regime that began on April 9. Both sides [...] government and opposition [...] bear responsibility for the resulting rhetorical and political stalemate, which if left unresolved could escalate into violence or instability. We urge an alternative course, one that requires both sides to offer something {{to the other and}} to acknowledge that neither side has all the answers...|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1968, Kennedy {{had joined}} the new Committee for National Health Insurance at the {{invitation}} of its founder, United Auto Workers president Walter Reuther. In May 1970, Reuther died and Senator Ralph Yarborough, chairman of the full Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee and its Health subcommittee, lost his primary election, propelling Kennedy into a leadership role on the issue of national health insurance. Kennedy introduced <b>a</b> <b>bipartisan</b> bill in August 1970 for single-payer universal national health insurance with no cost sharing, paid for by payroll taxes and general federal revenue.|$|E
5|$|Concerning drugs, Paul {{has criticized}} {{mandatory}} minimums {{that he believes}} have led to unreasonably harsh sentences for repeat offenders. He has highlighted the case of Timothy L. Tyler as particularly unfair. Paul {{does not believe in}} legalizing the recreational use of drugs like marijuana and cocaine, but does not support jailing marijuana users. He supports state laws to legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Paul was one of three U.S. senators in 2015 to introduce <b>a</b> <b>bipartisan</b> bill, CARERS, that would legalize medical marijuana under federal law.|$|E
5|$|Four years earlier, in the {{election}} of 1876, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio defeated Democrat Samuel J. Tilden of New York {{in one of the}} most hotly contested presidential elections in the nation's history. The results initially indicated a Democratic victory, but the electoral votes of several states were disputed until just a few days before the new president was to be inaugurated. Members of both parties in Congress agreed to convene <b>a</b> <b>bipartisan</b> Electoral Commission, which ultimately decided the race for Hayes.|$|E
50|$|The {{bill was}} {{approved}} in <b>a</b> strong <b>bipartisan</b> vote of 250-175 in the House, {{with the support}} of 15 House Republicans, including Murphy's home-state colleagues Todd Platts and Charlie Dent.|$|R

5|$|McCain {{was born}} in the Panama Canal Zone. Had he been elected, he would have become the first {{president}} who was born outside the contiguous forty-eight states. This raised a potential legal issue, since the United States Constitution requires the president to be a natural-born citizen of the United States. <b>A</b> <b>bipartisan</b> legal review, and a unanimous but non-binding Senate resolution, both concluded that he is a natural-born citizen. Also, if inaugurated in 2009 at age 72years and 144days, he would have been the oldest U.S. president upon ascension to the presidency, and the second-oldest president to be inaugurated.|$|E
5|$|On April 20, 2010, an {{explosion}} destroyed an {{offshore drilling rig}} at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed <b>a</b> <b>bipartisan</b> commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review. As multiple efforts by BP failed, some {{in the media and}} public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Randall spent early December {{in conference}} with Tilden while {{committees}} examined the votes from the disputed states. The counts of the disputed ballots were inconclusive, {{with each of}} the states in question producing two sets of returns: one signed by Democratic officials, the other by Republicans, each claiming victory for their man. By January 1877, with the question still unresolved, Congress and President Grant agreed to submit the matter to <b>a</b> <b>bipartisan</b> Electoral Commission, which would be authorized to determine the fate of the disputed electoral votes.|$|E
40|$|The National Education Goals Panel (NEGP) is <b>a</b> unique <b>bipartisan</b> and {{intergovernmental}} body {{of federal}} and state officials created in July 1990 to assess and report state and national progress toward achieving the National Education Goals.

5|$|After Republicans {{gained control}} of the Senate in 1981, Mathias sought the {{chairmanship}} of the Judiciary Committee but was relegated to the relatively mundane chairmanship of the Rules Committee. He was also appointed chairman of the Government Operations Subcommittee on Government Efficiency and the District of Columbia, and accepted a seat on the influential Foreign Relations Committee, though he had to sacrifice his seat on the Appropriations Committee to do so. In 1982, Mathias chaired <b>a</b> <b>bipartisan</b> Senate inquiry into the methods used by the FBI in the Abscam corruption investigation, which found that dozens of officials had been named for accepting bribes without basis. He also served as co-chair of the Joint Committee on Printing from 1981 to 1983 and 1985 to 1987, and {{as a member of the}} Joint Committee on the Library from 1983 to 1987.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{progressive}} reforms advocated by McCreary and {{passed in the}} 1912 legislative session were making women eligible to vote in school board elections, mandating direct primary elections, and allowing the state's counties to hold local option elections {{to decide whether or}} not to adopt prohibition. McCreary appointed a tax commission to study the revenue system, and the Board of Assessments and Valuation made a more realistic appraisal of corporate property. McCreary created executive departments to oversee state banking and highways, and <b>a</b> <b>bipartisan</b> vote in the General Assembly established the Kentucky Public Service Commission. Near the close of the session, McCreary County was created and named in the governor's honor. It was the last of Kentucky's 120 counties to be constituted.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{his earlier}} battle with Stevens, Blaine {{led the fight}} in Congress for a strong dollar. After the {{issuance}} of 150 million dollars in greenbacks—non-gold-backed currency—the {{value of the dollar}} stood at a low ebb. <b>A</b> <b>bipartisan</b> group of inflationists, led by Republican Benjamin F. Butler and Democrat George H. Pendleton, wished to preserve the status quo and allow the Treasury to continue to issue greenbacks and even to use them to pay the interest due on pre-war bonds. Blaine called this idea a repudiation of the nation’s promise to investors, which was made when the only currency was gold. Speaking several times on the matter, Blaine said that the greenbacks had only ever been an emergency measure to avoid bankruptcy during the war. Blaine and his hard money allies were successful, but the issue remained alive until 1879, when all remaining greenbacks were made redeemable in gold by the Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875.|$|E

According to Gore, [...] "Tipper and I are devoting 100 percent of the profits from {{the book and the}} movie to <b>a</b> new <b>bipartisan</b> educational campaign to further spread the message about global warming."
