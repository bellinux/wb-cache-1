The quality of the orchestra and the program ideas of Carlos Kalmar {{attracted the attention of}} a large group of music lovers in and outside the U.S. During a pleasant meeting at the Chicago airport almost two years ago the idea for this new album was discussed. I believe all at the table liked it and now everybody can hear how these three pieces, although by composers with different styles, fit perfectly in one program. <b>And</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>the</b> Copland symphony {{is one of the best}} pieces ever written by an American composer.|$|E

25|$|The 567D's {{turbocharger}} {{is perhaps}} the least maintainable part of such an engine, and the 567D turbo has many more maintenance issues than 645E and later turbos. A common choice is conversion of a 567D turbo engine to Roots-blown, thereby abandoning the turbo and its many issues. Installation of 645 power assemblies will still allow Roots-converted 4-axle locomotives (GP20s) to produce , as does a Roots-blown 16-645E, thereby becoming the functional equivalent of a GP38, although with older electrical equipment and controls, <b>and,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>the</b> older carbody.|$|E

Mont Blanc has more deaths each year than Everest, with over one hundred dying in a typical year and over eight thousand killed since records were kept. Some factors that affect total mountain lethality include the level of popularity of the mountain, the skill of those climbing, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>the</b> difficulty of the climb.|$|E
