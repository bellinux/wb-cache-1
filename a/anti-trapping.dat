40|$|Despite the <b>anti-trapping</b> {{initiatives}} {{that occurred during}} 1992 – 2000, the overall national trend has been less restrictive trapping regulations as they apply to cable-restraint devices. We believe this policy shift among state wildlife agencies has been influenced by two different events. The first relates to advances in trap technology and trapping methods. Nowhere has this change been {{more evident than in}} the liberalization of snaring regulations for the capture of beaver. Even land-based snaring has been expanded as development of break-away devices and setting strategies have increased snare performance to capture target-species, and do so without lethal effects. The second event was the development of reliable trap-testing research, such as that performed by the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agency and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, which documented the remarkable advances made by trap manufacturers and in trapping techniques. In light of these developments, it is indeed a conundrum why more states, particularly on the eastern seaboard, have not updated their regulations to permit broader use of cable-restraints. One suspects, however, that the lack of modernization of the regulations stems from the erroneous and outdated reputation that snares are by definition lethal devices and therefore dangerous. Improved education and dissemination of facts should help dispel this incomplete view of snares and cable-restraints.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of nonlinear localized excitations (solitons) in two-dimensional (2 D) Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with repulsive interactions, loaded into an optical lattice (OL), which is combined with an external parabolic potential. First, we demonstrate analytically that a broad (loosely bound, LB) soliton state, based on a 2 D Bloch function {{near the edge of}} the Brillouin zone (BZ), has a negative effective mass (while the mass of a localized state is positive near the BZ center). The negative-mass soliton cannot be held by the usual trap, but it is safely confined by an inverted parabolic potential (anti-trap). Direct simulations demonstrate that the LB solitons (including the ones with intrinsic vorticity) are stable and can freely move on top of the OL. The frequency of elliptic motion of the LB-soliton's center in the <b>anti-trapping</b> potential is very close to the analytical prediction which treats the solition as a quasi-particle. In addition, the LB soliton of the vortex type features real rotation around its center. We also find an abrupt transition, which occurs with the increase of the number of atoms, from the negative-mass LB states to tightly bound (TB) solitons. An estimate demonstrates that, for the zero-vorticity states, the transition occurs when the number of atoms attains a critical number N= 10 ^ 3, while for the vortex the transition takes place at N= 5 x 10 ^ 3 atoms. The positive-mass LB states constructed near the BZ center (including vortices) can move freely too. The effects predicted for BECs also apply to optical spatial solitons in bulk photonic crystals.

40|$|Adapting and {{extending}} a suggestion due to Page, we define a wormhole throat to be a marginally <b>anti-trapped</b> surface, that is, a closed two-dimensional spatial hypersurface such {{that one of}} the two future-directed null geodesic congruences orthogonal to it is just beginning to diverge. Typically a dynamic wormhole will possess two such throats, corresponding to the two orthogonal null geodesic congruences, and these two throats will not coincide, (though they do coalesce into a single throat in the static limit). The divergence property of the null geodesics at the marginally <b>anti-trapped</b> surface generalizes the ``flare-out'' condition for an arbitrary wormhole. We derive theorems regarding violations of the null energy condition (NEC) at and near these throats and find that, even for wormholes with arbitrary time-dependence, the violation of the NEC is a generic property of wormhole throats. We also discuss wormhole throats in the presence of fully antisymmetric torsion and find that the energy condition violations cannot be dumped into the torsion degrees of freedom. Finally by means of a concrete example we demonstrate that even temporary suspension of energy-condition violations is incompatible with the flare-out property of dynamic throats.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of one-dimensional solitons in the attractive and repulsive Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) loaded into an optical lattice (OL), which is combined with an external parabolic potential. First, we demonstrate analytically that, in the repulsive BEC, where the soliton is of the gap type, its effective mass is negative. This {{gives rise to a}} prediction for the experiment: such a soliton cannot be not held by the usual parabolic trap, but it can be captured (performing harmonic oscillations) by an <b>anti-trapping</b> inverted parabolic potential. We also study the motion of the soliton a in long system, concluding that, in the cases of both the positive and negative mass, it moves freely, provided that its amplitude is below a certain critical value; above it, the soliton’s velocity decreases due to the interaction with the OL. At a late stage, the damped motion becomes chaotic. We also investigate the evolution of a two-soliton pulse in the attractive model. The pulse generates a persistent breather, if its amplitude is not too large; otherwise, fusion into a single fundamental soliton takes place. Collisions between two solitons captured in the parabolic trap or anti-trap are considered too. Depending on their amplitudes and phase difference, the solitons either perform stable oscillations, colliding indefinitely many times, or merge into a single soliton. Effects reported in this work for BECs can also be formulated for optical solitons in nonlinear photonic crystals. In particular, the capture of the negative-mass soliton in the anti-trap implies that a bright optical soliton in a self-defocusing medium with a periodic structure of the refractive index may be stable in an anti-waveguide. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} welded {{products}} is largely determined by solidified structures and dendrite is the predominant pattern. However, studying {{the evolution of}} morphology during solidification at micrometre scale using experimental techniques is of high cost. Therefore, in this PhD project phase-field (PF) models were developed and applied to simulate the dendritic growth of industrially important steels in a weld pool. The problem of Ohno and Matsuuras proposal to include solid diffusivity in PF simulations is that a priori unknown term associated with the solute flux needs to be input. In this work, mathematical and numerical analyses indicate that credible results {{can be obtained by}} setting that term as zero. The effect of solid diffusivity on the steady-state dendrite under free growth was next investigated, showing that the solid diffusivity of C should be included for Fe-C alloys. The evolution of side branches under the imposed transient conditions by decreasing the velocity was examined because dendrites do not grow under steady state in a weld pool. It was observed that the remelting of the smaller side branches started from the side branch tips and the necklace width of the surviving side branches increased during the ripening process whether under steady state or transient conditions. However, the final necklace widths of the surviving side branches are finer under the transient conditions, implying that the detachment of side branches is more likely to occur under the transient condition, in agreement with the published experimental reports. Finally a new quantitative thin-interface PF solidification model for ternary alloys was extended and validated. The proposed model has the advantages: (1) the schemes of thin-interface limit analysis and <b>anti-trapping</b> current are adopted to simultaneously ensure the calculation efficiency and accuracy, and (2) the solid diffusivity can be included for steels...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} program reported here {{is focused on}} critical issues that represent conspicuous gaps in current understanding of rapid solidification, limiting our ability to predict and control microstructural evolution (i. e. morphological dynamics and microsegregation) at high undercooling, where conditions depart significantly from local equilibrium. More specifically, through careful application of phase-field modeling, using appropriate thin-interface and <b>anti-trapping</b> corrections and addressing important details such as transient effects and a velocity-dependent (i. e. adaptive) numerics, the current analysis provides a reasonable simulation-based picture of non-equilibrium solute partitioning and the corresponding oscillatory dynamics associated with single-phase rapid solidification and show that this method is a suitable means for a self-consistent simulation of transient behavior and operating point selection under rapid growth conditions. Moving beyond the limitations of conventional theoretical/analytical treatments of non-equilibrium solute partitioning, these results serve to substantiate recent experimental findings and analytical treatments for single-phase rapid solidification. The departure from the equilibrium solid concentration at the solid-liquid interface was often observed during rapid solidification, and the energetic associated non-equilibrium solute partitioning has been treated in detail, providing possible ranges of interface concentrations for a given growth condition. Use of these treatments for analytical description of specific single-phase dendritic and cellular operating point selection, however, requires a model for solute partitioning under a given set of growth conditions. Therefore, analytical solute trapping models which describe the chemical partitioning {{as a function of}} steady state interface velocities have been developed and widely utilized in most of the theoretical investigations of rapid solidification. However, these solute trapping models are not rigorously verified due to the difficulty in experimentally measuring under rapid growth conditions. Moreover, since these solute trapping models include kinetic parameters which are difficult to directly measure from experiments, application of the solute trapping models or the associated analytic rapid solidification model is limited. These theoretical models for steady state rapid solidification which incorporate the solute trapping models do not describe the interdependency of solute diffusion, interface kinetics, and alloy thermodynamics. The phase-field approach allows calculating, spontaneously, the non-equilibrium growth effects of alloys and the associated time-dependent growth dynamics, without making the assumptions that solute partitioning is an explicit function of velocity, as is the current convention. In the research described here, by utilizing the phase-field model in the thin-interface limit, incorporating the <b>anti-trapping</b> current term, more quantitatively valid interface kinetics and solute diffusion across the interface are calculated. In order to sufficiently resolve the physical length scales (i. e. interface thickness and diffusion boundary length), grid spacings are continually adjusted in calculations. The full trajectories of transient planar growth dynamics under rapid directional solidification conditions with different pulling velocities are described. As a validation of a model, the predicted steady state conditions are consistent with the analytic approach for rapid growth. It was confirmed that rapid interface dynamics exhibits the abrupt acceleration of the planar front when the effect of the non-equilibrium solute partitioning at the interface becomes signi ficant. This is consistent with the previous linear stability analysis for the non-equilibrium interface dynamics. With an appropriate growth condition, the continuous oscillation dynamics was able to be simulated using continually adjusting grid spacings. This oscillatory dynamics including instantaneous jump of interface velocities are consistent with a previous phenomenological model by and a numerical investigation, which may cause the formation of banded structures. Additionally, the selection of the steady state growth dynamics in the highly undercooled melt is demonstrated. The transition of the growth morphology, interface velocity selection, and solute trapping phenomenon with increasing melt supersaturations was described by the phase-field simulation. The tip selection for the dendritic growth was consistent with Ivantsov's function, and the non-equilibrium chemical partitioning behavior shows good qualitative agreement with the Aziz's solute trapping model even though the model parameter(V{sub D}) remains as an arbitrary constant. This work is able to show the possibility of comprehensive description of rapid alloy growth over the entire time-dependent non-equilibrium phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|It {{is by now}} {{apparent}} that topology is too crude a tool to accurately characterize a generic traversable wormhole. In two earlier papers we developed a complete characterization of generic but static traversable wormholes, and in the present paper extend the discussion to arbitrary time-dependent (dynamical) wormholes. A local definition of wormhole throat, free from assumptions about asymptotic flatness, symmetries, future and past null infinities, embedding diagrams, topology, and even time-dependence is developed that accurately captures {{the essence of what}} a wormhole throat is, and where it is located. Adapting and extending a suggestion due to Page, we define a wormhole throat to be a marginally <b>anti-trapped</b> surface, that is, a closed two-dimensional spatial hypersurface such that one of the two future-directed null geodesic congruences orthogonal to it is just beginning to diverge. Typically a dynamic wormhole will possess two such throats, corresponding to the two orthogonal null geodesic congruences, and these two throats will not coincide, (though they do coalesce into a single throat in the static limit). The divergence property of the null geodesics at the marginally <b>anti-trapped</b> surface generalizes the “flare-out ” condition for an arbitrary wormhole. We derive theorems regarding violations of the null energy condition (NEC) at and near these throats and find that, even for wormholes with arbitrary timedependence, the violation of the NEC is a generic property of wormhole throats. We also discuss wormhole throats in the presence of fully antisymmetric torsion and find that the energy condition violations cannot be dumped into the torsion degrees of freedom. Finally by means of a concrete example we demonstrate that even temporary suspension of 1 energy-condition violations is incompatible with the flare-out property of dynamic throats...|$|R
