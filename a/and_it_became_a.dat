5|$|Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu was {{released}} theatrically on 14 January 1959, during the Makar Sankranti festival season. With mediocre earnings {{during its first}} four weeks, the film became an above-average grosser. Its re-release was profitable, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> Telugu cult film.|$|E
5|$|Critics gave {{it mostly}} {{positive}} reviews <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> best-seller in Canada. It {{was nominated for}} the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, the Books in Canada First Novel Award, and the Kiriyama Prize. It has been analysed in several literature journals, including Canadian Ethnic Studies which noted {{the similarities between the}} character Emiko and the Hiroshima Maidens.|$|E
5|$|Kalidas was {{released}} with high expectations on 31 October 1931, coinciding with Diwali day. It {{was the only}} Tamil film to be produced and released that year. Despite numerous technical flaws, it received critical acclaim, with praise for Rajalakshmi's singing performance, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> major commercial success. The success of Kalidas spawned other films based upon Kālidāsa, including Mahakavi Kalidasa (1955), Mahakavi Kalidasu (1960) and Mahakavi Kalidas (1966).|$|E
50|$|In 1878, {{additional}} railways {{came to the}} village, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>an</b> important {{center of}} papermaking.|$|R

5|$|After the Restoration of Charles II, the pre-war {{owners of}} the {{property}} laid claim to Clifford's Tower, eventually being granted ownership. A garrison continued to be stationed there, however, which prevented the owners from actually occupying or using the property. Repairs {{were made to the}} tower, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> magazine for storing gunpowder and shot. Attempts were made to restore the condition of the moat, which had become badly silted. Some political prisoners continued to be held at the castle during the Restoration period, including George Fox, the founder of the Society of Friends.|$|E
5|$|Before it {{was founded}} in 1810 by Lewis Tregonwell, the area was a deserted {{heathland}} occasionally visited by fishermen and smugglers. Initially marketed as a health resort, the town received a boost when it appeared in Augustus Granville's 1841 book, The Spas of England. Bournemouth's growth truly accelerated {{with the arrival of the}} railway <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> recognised town in 1870. Historically part of Hampshire, it joined Dorset with the reorganisation of local government in 1974. Since 1997, the town has been administered by a unitary authority, meaning it is independent of Dorset County Council, although it remains part of that ceremonial county. The local council is Bournemouth Borough Council.|$|E
5|$|Bill Lear {{distributed}} the Stereo-Pak in 1963, intending to install units in his Learjet aircraft. However, he soon decided to re-engineer and customize the units to suit his own wishes, {{the result of}} which became the Stereo8 system. The market for Muntz's 4-track system had faded by 1970 due to competition from Stereo 8, which reduced costs by using less magnetic tape and a less-complex cartridge mechanism. Although the 4-track system had higher fidelity since the tape speed was double {{the speed of the}} Stereo8 system (and the 4-track had wider heads for better bandwidth), the Stereo8 quickly became the dominant format for car stereo systems during the late 1960s. Ford Motor Company began featuring Stereo8 players in their 1965 automobiles, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> standard option by 1966.|$|E

5|$|Charles Conn {{returned}} to Elkhart after the Civil War and established C.G. Conn Ltd., {{a manufacturer of}} musical instruments. The company's innovation in band instruments made Elkhart an important center of the music world, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> base of Elkhart's economy for decades. Nearby South Bend experienced continued growth following the Civil War, and became a large manufacturing city centered around the Oliver Farm Equipment Company, the nation's leading plow producer. Gary was founded in 1906 by the United States Steel Corporation as the home for its new plant.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin {{published}} The Songlines in 1987, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> bestseller in {{both the}} United Kingdom and the United States. The book was nominated for the Thomas Cook Travel Award, but Chatwin requested that it be withdrawn from consideration, saying the work was fictional. Following its publication, Chatwin became friends with composer Kevin Volans, who was inspired to base a theatre score on the book. The project evolved into an opera, The Man with Footsoles of Wind (1993).|$|E
5|$|Chatwin's books also {{inspired}} {{some readers}} to visit Patagonia and Australia. As {{a result of}} his work, Patagonia experienced an increase in tourism, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> common sight for tourists to appear in the region, carrying a copy of In Patagonia. The Songlines also inspired readers to travel to Australia and seek out the people Chatwin had based his characters on, much to their consternation, as he had failed to disclose to these individuals his intentions.|$|E

5|$|Como died in {{his sleep}} on May 12, 2001, {{at his home in}} Jupiter Inlet Colony, Florida, six days before his 89th birthday. He was {{reported}} to have suffered from symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Como's older son, Ronnie, and his daughter, Terri, could not agree on their interpretations of Como's 1999 living will <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> matter for the courts in the year before his death. His funeral Mass took place at St. Edward's Catholic Church in Palm Beach, Florida. Como and his wife, Roselle are buried at Riverside Memorial Park, Tequesta (Palm Beach County), Florida.|$|E
5|$|Lennon {{played a}} mouth organ during a bus journey {{to visit his}} cousin in Scotland; the music caught the driver's ear. Impressed, the driver told Lennon of a {{harmonica}} he could have if he came to Edinburgh the following day, where one had been stored in the bus depot since a passenger left it on a bus. The professional instrument quickly replaced Lennon's toy. He would continue to play harmonica, often using the instrument during the Beatles' Hamburg years, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> signature sound in the group's early recordings. His mother {{taught him how to}} play the banjo, later buying him an acoustic guitar. At 16, he played rhythm guitar with the Quarrymen.|$|E
5|$|On 26 December 211, at a {{reconciliation}} meeting arranged by their mother, Caracalla had Geta assassinated {{by members of}} the Praetorian Guard loyal to himself, Geta dying in his mother's arms. Caracalla then persecuted and executed most of Geta's supporters and ordered a damnatio memoriae pronounced by the Senate against his brother's memory. Geta's image was removed from all paintings, coins were melted down, statues were destroyed, his name was struck from papyrus records, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> capital offence to speak or write Geta's name. In the aftermath of the damnatio memoriae, an estimated 20,000 people were massacred. Those killed were Geta's inner circle of guards and advisers, friends, and other military staff under his employ.|$|E
50|$|Malý Šariš {{belonged to}} the largest villages in the Sáros (Šariš) County, but its size {{gradually}} diminished <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>an</b> average village {{before the end of}} the 16th century.|$|R

5|$|Rapid {{economic}} growth marked McKinley's presidency. He promoted the 1897 Dingley Tariff to protect manufacturers and factory workers from foreign competition, and in 1900, he secured {{the passage of}} the Gold Standard Act. McKinley hoped to persuade Spain to grant independence to rebellious Cuba without conflict, but when negotiation failed, he led the nation into the Spanish–American War of 1898; the U.S. victory was quick and decisive. As part of the peace settlement, Spain turned over to the United States its main overseas colonies of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines; Cuba was promised independence, but at that time remained {{under the control of the}} U.S. Army. The United States annexed the independent Republic of Hawaii in 1898 <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> U.S. territory.|$|E
5|$|Spain and {{subsequently}} Mexico controlled {{much of what}} is now the western United States until the Mexican–American War, including the entire state of Texas. After Texas joined the United States, the native Tejanos living in the state began culturally developing separately from their neighbors to the south, and remained culturally distinct from other Texans. Central to the evolution of early Tejano music was the blend of traditional Mexican forms such as mariachi and the corrido, and Continental European styles introduced by German and Czech settlers in the late 19th century. In particular, the accordion was adopted by Tejano folk musicians around the start of the 20th century, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> popular instrument for amateur musicians in Texas and Northern Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Vimy Ridge was {{the first}} {{occasion}} on which all four divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force participated in a battle as a cohesive formation, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> Canadian national symbol of achievement and sacrifice. France ceded to Canada perpetual use of a portion of land on Vimy Ridge on the understanding that Canada use the land to establish a battlefield park and memorial. Wartime tunnels, trenches, craters, and unexploded munitions still honeycomb {{the grounds of the}} site, which remains largely closed off for reasons of public safety. Along with preserved trench lines, several other memorials and cemeteries are contained within the park.|$|E

5|$|The British Government {{purchased}} Hillingdon House in 1915 <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> military hospital. In 1917, {{what would}} become the Royal Air Force station RAF Uxbridge was established within the grounds. In military use, the house has served over time as the first headquarters for No. 11 Group RAF and RAF Bomber Command. The River Pinn passes through the grounds of the house from north to south, splitting the former RAF Uxbridge in two.|$|E
5|$|The Test {{selectors}} made five {{changes to}} the team who had played in the previous Test match. Significantly, Australia's most successful bowler Clarrie Grimmett was replaced by Ward, one of four players making their debut. Bradman's role in Grimmett's omission from the team was controversial <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> theme that dogged Bradman as Grimmett continued to be prolific in domestic cricket while his successors were ineffective—he was regarded as having finished the veteran bowler's Test career in a political purge.|$|E
5|$|The dinner {{scene was}} shot in a revamped version of the Enterprise-D's {{observation}} lounge. Along the wall are portraits of historical figures including Abraham Lincoln, Spock's father Sarek (Mark Lenard), and an unnamed Andorian ambassador. The food prepared for the scene was colored blue so it would look alien. None of the actors wanted to eat the unappetizing dishes (especially after they grew ripe under hot studio lights), <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> running joke among the crew during filming to make them sample their food.|$|E
5000|$|The {{station was}} renamed to RAF Blackbushe on the 18 November 1944 <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>an</b> {{airfield}} for the Douglas Dakotas of RAF Transport Command during the 1948 airlift during the Berlin Blockade.|$|R
