5|$|The {{computer}} console {{explosion that}} causes the transporter malfunction was simulated using brillo pads. Weldon hid steel wool inside the console and attached an <b>arc</b> <b>welder</b> to operate by remote control when the actor pulled a wire. The welder was designed to create a spark instead of actually welding, causing the steel wool to burn and make sparks; so effective was the setup that the cast members were continually startled by the flare-ups, resulting in additional takes. Various canisters and cargo containers appear to be suspended by Anti-gravity throughout the film. These effects were executed by several of Weldon's assistants. The crew built a circular track that had the same shape as the corridor and suspended the antigravity prop on four small wires that connected to the track. The wires were treated with a special acid which oxidized the metal; the reaction tarnished the wires to a dull gray that would not {{show up in the}} deep blue corridor lighting. Cargo boxes were made out of light balsa wood so that fine wires could be used as support.|$|E

Luening said the latter option was more practical, because the artist could paint on panels in her studio instead of working outside. New Seasons hired Dan Cohen of Dan Cohen Creative Labs to duplicate the mural using a method similar to one he uses in his work as a [...] "mega mural" [...] painter. He said of the process: I paint giant advertising murals all over the country. I do about one mural a month. We create the pattern using the original image, and paint on top of it.

40|$|Alveolar macrophages are {{essential}} components of pulmonary defense. They are unique among mononuclear phagocytes in having direct exposure to inhaled microorganisms and environmental toxins {{and in their}} metabolic adaptations to the aerobic environment. On the other hand, they {{are thought to have}} some properties common to all mononuclear phagocytes which constitute the reticuloendothelial system. Moreover, the ironladen alveolar macrophages seem {{to play a role in}} the induction of tissue injury and iron transport of the lung. In this experiment, the functions of alveolar macrophages, namely, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, β-galactosidase activity and superoxide production were studied in patients with <b>arc</b> <b>welder's</b> lung, other lung diseases and normal adults as controls. No significant difference was present in the chemotaxis of alveolar macrophages to zymosan activated serum between normal subjects and patients with <b>arc</b> <b>welder's</b> lung. The phagocytosis of opsonized zymosan particles by alveolar macrophages from patients with <b>arc</b> <b>welder's</b> lung was less than that of normal subjects. No significant difference was observed in the phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages between normal subjects and patients with lung diseases except for <b>arc</b> <b>welder's</b> lung. There was no significant difference in β-galactosidase activity of alveolar macrophages between normal subjects and patients with <b>arc</b> <b>welder's</b> lung. Superoxide production by alveolar macrophages from patients with <b>arc</b> <b>welder's</b> lung was significantly lower than of normal subjects. The observations reported here indicate that the functions of alveolar macrophages, especially phagocytosis and superoxide production, are suppressed in <b>arc</b> <b>welder's</b> lung...|$|R

40|$|To {{develop a}} method for the early {{diagnosis}} of health damage due to arc welding, we measured serum ferritin in 96 general employees and 320 <b>arc</b> <b>welders</b> in Company A. A positive correlation was observed between age and the serum ferritin level in the young group (age, 20 - 44 years) among the general employees. The mean serum ferritin level in the general employees was 119 ± 56 ng/ml. When the mean ± 2. 5 SD {{was used as the}} standard value, ferritin levels > 260 ng / ml could be regarded as high.

40|$|Introduction Welding work is {{associated}} with the inhalation of fumes and accumulation of particulates in welders' lungs. It is assumed that particulates deposited in the respiratory system, mainly consisting of iron oxides, are eliminated by several mechanisms, such as muco-ciliary transport and macrophage phagocytosis. In their cross-sectional study of 42 Finnish shipyard <b>arc</b> <b>welders,</b> Kalliomki et al. indicated that from 10 to 20 % of total accumulated welding particulates from fumes was eliminated annually from welders' lungs [1]. However, longitudinal changes in the lung deposition of welding particulates have not yet been fully described. We previously reported a cross-sectional distribution of magnetopneumographic (MPG) measurements of Japanese electric <b>arc</b> <b>welders</b> [2]. Follow-up examination of those welders was conducted five years after the baseline survey.

50|$|In arc welding, an {{electrode}} is used {{to conduct}} current through a workpiece to fuse two pieces together. Depending upon the process, the electrode is either consumable, {{in the case of}} gas metal arc welding or shielded metal arc welding, or non-consumable, such as in gas tungsten arc welding. For a direct current system, the weld rod or stick may be a cathode for a filling type weld or an anode for other welding processes. For an alternating current <b>arc</b> <b>welder,</b> the welding electrode would not be considered an anode or cathode.|$|E
5000|$|Arc has {{historical}} significance since several innovative models were {{the inspiration for}} flashlights later produced by other companies.

50|$|In some {{applications}} increased leakage is desired, {{and long}} magnetic paths, air gaps, or magnetic bypass shunts may deliberately be introduced in a transformer design {{to limit the}} short-circuit current it will supply.

50|$|Glidcop {{has been}} {{successfully}} applied to resistance welding electrodes to reduce stick to galvanized and other coated steels, and in incandescent light bulb leads by resisting softening after exposure to high temperatures. Likewise, Glidcop has found used in relay blades and contactor supports. The alloy's ability to maintain strength after high temperature brazing has led to use in hybrid circuit packages. Furthermore, it has found use in other high temperature applications such as x-ray tube components, and heat exchanger sections for fusion power and synchrotron units. Other uses include high field magnetic coils, sliding electrical contacts, <b>arc</b> <b>welder</b> electrodes, electronic leadframes, MIG contact tips, commutators, high speed motor and generator components, and microwave power tube components.|$|E
