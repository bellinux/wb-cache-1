40|$|Objectives: We {{assessed}} the current genetic {{evidence for the}} involvement of various cell types and tissue types in the aetiology of neurodegenerative diseases, especially {{in relation to the}} neuroinflammatory hypothesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Methods: We obtained large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We used multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, as a positive control. We applied stratified LD score regression to determine if functional marks for cell type and tissue activity, and gene set lists were enriched for genetic heritability. We compared our results to those from two gene-set enrichment methods (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and enrichr). Results: There were no significant heritability enrichments for <b>annotations</b> <b>marking</b> genes active within brain regions, but there were for <b>annotations</b> <b>marking</b> genes active within cell-types that form part of both the innate and adaptive immune systems. We found this for MS (as expected) and also for AD and PD. The strongest signals were from the adaptive immune system (e. g. T cells) for PD, and from both the adaptive (e. g. T cells) and innate (e. g. CD 14 : a marker for monocytes, and CD 15 : a marker for neutrophils) immune systems for AD. Annotations from the liver were also significant for AD. Pathway analysis provided complementary results. Interpretation: For Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, we found significant enrichment of heritability in <b>annotations</b> <b>marking</b> gene activity in immune cells...|$|R

40|$|We {{believe the}} absence of massively-parallel, sharedmemory {{machines}} follows {{from the lack of}} a sharedmemory programming performance model that can inform programmers of the cost of operations (so they can avoid expensive ones) and can tell hardware designers which cases are common (so they can build simple hardware to optimize them). Cooperative shared memory, our approach to shared-memory design, addresses this problem. Our initial implementation of cooperative shared memory uses a simple programming model, called Check-In / Check-Out (CICO), in conjunction with even simpler hardware, called Dir 1 SW. In CICO, programs bracket uses of shared data with a checkout <b>annotation</b> <b>marking</b> the expected first use and a check-in annotation terminating the expected use of the data. A cooperative prefetch annotation helps hide communication latency.

40|$|Dealing {{effectively}} with memory access latency {{is one of}} the key challenges in the design of shared-memory multiprocessors. Processor caches offer a way to reduce this latency but also give rise to the problem of cache coherence. Existing software solutions to the cache coherence problem are usually inefficient, while hardware solutions are typically complex and expensive to implement. In this thesis, we present a new class of software cache coherence strategies based upon the integration of a program-level abstraction for shared data, called Shared Regions (SR), with run-time cache management. In this approach, user's define a set of shared regions, the unit of sharing in the application. Data is managed at the granularity of shared regions, and coherence enforcement decisions are made dynamically through software. Within the shared regions framework, we present two types of coherence solutions. In the first, called SR-Prog, program <b>annotations</b> <b>mark</b> the beginning and end of a series o [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We are {{developing}} and annotating a learner corpus of Hungarian, composed of student journals {{from three different}} proficiency levels written at Indiana University. Our <b>annotation</b> <b>marks</b> learner errors that are of different linguistic categories, including phonology, morphology, and syntax, but defining the annotation for an agglutinative language presents several issues. First, we must adapt an analysis that is centered on the morpheme rather than the word. Second, and more importantly, we see a need to distinguish errors from secondary corrections. We argue that although certain learner errors require a series of corrections to reach a target form, these secondary corrections, conditioned on those that come before, are our own adjustments that link the learner’s productions to the target form and are not representative of the learner’s internal grammar. In this paper, we report the annotation scheme and the principles that guide it, as well as examples illustrating its functionality and directions for expansion.

50|$|The {{earliest}} classical calendrical poem {{which might}} have inspired Ovid is the Works and Days of Hesiod, which includes mythological lore, astronomical observations, and an agricultural calendar. For the astronomical sections, Ovid was preceded by Aratus' Phaenomena as well as lost poetry on constellations and probably Germanicus' adaptation of Aratus (Fasti 1.17-27). The most significant influence on Ovid were the Roman fasti, the Roman calendrical lists, which included dates, notices of festivals, ritual prohibitions and proscriptions, anniversaries of important events, and sometimes aetiological material. Ovid often mentions consulting these calendars, such as his reference at 1.11 to pictos fastos and his references to the actual <b>annotation</b> <b>marks</b> of the calendar. The {{most important of these}} calendars for Ovid were probably the Fasti Praenestini, a contemporary calendar constructed and annotated by the grammarian Verrius Flaccus, whose fragments include much ritual material that can be found in Ovid's poem. The concept of putting these calendars into verse however, seems to be a uniquely Ovidian concept.|$|R

The earliest document showing this usage is a diagram among the silk manuscripts from Mawangdui tomb 3, sealed in 168 BC. An <b>annotation</b> <b>marking</b> the firstyear {{of the reign of}} Qin Shi Huang (秦始皇), 246 BC, is applied to the diagram next to the position of the 60-cycle term (51 of 60, 甲寅—jiǎ - yín) corresponding to that year. Use of the cycle to record years became widespread for administrative time-keeping during the Western Han Dynasty (202 BC - 8 AD). The count of years has continued uninterrupted ever since: the year 1984 began the present cycle (a 甲子—jiǎ-zǐ year), and 2044 will begin another. Note that in China the new year, when the sexagenary count increments, is not January 1, but rather the lunar new year of the traditional Chinese calendar. For example, the yi-chou 己丑 year (coinciding roughly with 2009) began on January 26, 2009.

40|$|Abstract:- Taking C {{programming}} language learning as an example, {{this paper describes}} {{the development of a}} Web-based multi-user error correction, analysis, and feedback system. This system reinvented traditional paper-based error feedback and error correction in the form of interactive error analysis and error feedback, which is a new type of computer corpus annotation for learning. In this system, users can create error corrections (annotations) {{in the same way as}} the traditional paper-based correction approach. In addition, this system can provide users the <b>annotation</b> <b>marks</b> subject to different query contitions so that the problem of cognitive overload can be avoided. For error analysis purposes, this system can access the database and analyzes students’ errors and displays the results as requested. Four error analysis options are included: single document for an individual student, all documents for an individual student, single document for all students, and all documents for a group of students. With the multi-user correction component, this proposed system has the capability of peer assessment; and with correction analysis, this proposed system can feedback correct answers and teachers’ comments to students.

40|$|The {{success of}} interlingual {{annotation}} depends crucially on agreement {{as to the}} entities to be annotated, {{both in terms of}} the categories of entities {{and in terms of the}} names of the entities. Two independent annotation efforts at Penn resulted in annotations which had a comfortable amount of overlap but which still disagreed substantially on even the categories to be <b>marked.</b> The English <b>annotation</b> took a very rich approach to <b>annotation,</b> <b>marking</b> a great many relationships which were not explicitly mentioned in the conference guidelines but which seemed logical and necessary to avoid losing important information. The Chinese annotation, in contrast, took a conservative approach, more in line with the conference guidelines, therefore showing many fewer marked entities. This mismatch can be attributed to the lack of specific guidelines for annotation. In contrast, the PropBank annotation scheme, designed for predicate-argument structure, specifies the same set of markable entities in each language, while still capturing most of the information desired by the conference guidelines. This allows for a considerable savings in time and annotator effort, largely due to the large existing dictionary of predicted argument structure. 1...|$|R
40|$|Temporal {{relations}} are binary relations that connect temporal events or temporal expressions in texts. On the other hand, texts display discourse structures, as those expressed by Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988).
