5|$|Chew Stoke {{has a long}} history, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{number and}} range of its heritage-listed buildings. The village is at the {{northern}} end of Chew Valley Lake, which was created in the 1950s, close to a dam, pumping station, sailing club, and fishing lodge. A tributary of the River Chew, which rises in Strode, runs through the village.|$|E
5|$|During {{the closing}} credits, it is {{indicated}} that the bank is successfully continuing with its operations despite the death of its Chairman—as Skarssen had predicted to Salinger before he was killed. However, with the new and more aggressive chairman, it is hinted that the IBBC's increased expansion and aggression will ultimately lead to its downfall, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> last panel, revealing {{the beginnings of a}} United States Senate investigation, headed by Whitman.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of {{evolution}} have argued in response that no scientist's claims {{are treated as}} sacrosanct, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> aspects of Darwin's theory that have been rejected or revised by scientists {{over the years to}} form first neo-Darwinism and later the modern evolutionary synthesis. The claim that evolution relies on faith is likewise rejected on the grounds that evolution has strong supporting evidence, and therefore does not require faith.|$|E

5|$|Unlike its sister, {{which was}} {{intended}} for emergency use only, this light was constantly manned by Coast Guard personnel, after the Coast Guard {{took charge of the}} lighthouses in the United States in 1939, who served two-week rotating tours. These men lived in the circular portion of the lighthouse. The dwelling encompassed not only the superstructure, but also part of the foundation, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ring of portholes in its side.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{aromatic}} imidazol-2-ylidenes or triazol-5-ylidenes, these carbenes appear {{not to be}} thermodynamically stable, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> dimerisation of some unhindered cyclic and acyclic examples. Studies {{suggest that}} these carbenes dimerise via acid catalysed dimerisation (as in the Wanzlick equilibrium).|$|E
5|$|A {{light ray}} {{emanating from the}} source S is {{reflected}} by a beam splitter G and is collimated into a parallel beam by lens L. After passing the slits O1 and O2, two rays of light travel through the tubes A1 and A2, through which water is streaming back and forth <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> arrows. The rays reflect off a mirror m at the focus of lens L, so that one ray always propagates {{in the same direction}} as the water stream, and the other ray opposite to the direction of the water stream. After passing back and forth through the tubes, both rays unite at S, where they produce interference fringes that can be visualized through the illustrated eyepiece. The interference pattern can be analyzed to determine the speed of light traveling along each leg of the tube.|$|E

50|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries Novi Ligure was {{a renowned}} resort {{for the rich}} Genoese families, <b>as</b> <b>showed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{presence}} of numerous noble palaces in the historical center of the city, often decorated with frescoes facades. These include Palazzo Negroni, Palazzo Durazzo and others. The most important palace is Palazzo Delle Piane (Delle Piane family), situated in the historic Piazza Delle Piane.|$|R
5|$|A single {{mandible}} from Porto Spanjo (one of {{the sites}} where fossils of A.donovani have been found), without preserved molars, differs from all Agathaeromys dentaries and is thought to represent an unknown different sigmodontine rodent. This jaw is more slender than A.donovani dentaries, has a shorter diastema (gap) between the incisors and molars, has the incisor less shifted lingually relative to the molars, and has more roots under the molars, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> preserved alveoli.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{the overall}} {{geomagnetic}} field is becoming weaker; the present strong deterioration {{corresponds to a}} 10–15% decline over the last 150 years and has accelerated {{in the past several}} years; geomagnetic intensity has declined almost continuously from a maximum 35% above the modern value achieved approximately 2,000 years ago. The rate of decrease and the current strength are within the normal range of variation, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> record of past magnetic fields recorded in rocks.|$|E
5|$|C. lepophagus was {{a similar}} in weight to modern coyotes, but had shorter limb bones that {{indicates}} a less cursorial lifestyle. The coyote represents a more primitive form of Canis than the gray wolf, {{as shown by}} its relatively small size and its comparatively narrow skull and jaws, which lack the grasping power necessary to hold the large prey in which wolves specialize. This is further corroborated by the coyote's sagittal crest, which is low or totally flattened, thus indicating a weaker bite than the wolf's. The coyote is not a specialized carnivore as the wolf is, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> larger chewing surfaces on the molars, reflecting the species' relative dependence on vegetable matter. In these respects, the coyote resembles the fox-like progenitors of the genus {{more so than the}} wolf.|$|E

50|$|In 1529 Luini {{completed}} {{one of his}} masterworks, {{the grand}} Passion and Crucifixion fresco at Santa Maria degli Angeli in Lugano, paired by other works in the same church. In 1531 {{he returned to the}} Saronno sanctuary to add other frescoes. In his later career Luini was increasingly influenced <b>by</b> Leonardo, <b>as</b> <b>showed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> St. Anne of the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana and the St. Catherine of the Hermitage.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to his official cult, Unas was deified and became a local god of the Saqqara necropolis. Grimal attributes this directly to the grandeur of his funerary complex. Malek doubts {{the existence of a}} popular cult of Unas during the Old Kingdom but acknowledges it from the Middle Kingdom onwards. He attributes this Middle Kingdom revival to the geographic position of Unas' complex making it a natural gateway to the Saqqara necropolis. The popular cult of the deified Unas continued for nearly 2,000 years <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> numerous scarabs bearing Unas' name found in Saqqara and dated from the New Kingdom (c.1550c.1077 BC) until the Late Period (664332 BC). The epicenter of this cult was not the pyramid of Unas nor the associated mortuary temple but rather the statues of the king in the valley temple.|$|E
5|$|Russia {{is one of}} the world's largest {{producers}} of energy, most of which it obtains from oil, natural gas and coal. The country's focus on those resources for production and export, which constitute 80% of foreign trade earnings, means it has paid little attention to renewable energy. Out of the 203GW of electric generation capacity that Russia has, 44GW comes from hydroelectricity, 307MW from geothermal, 15MW from wind and negligible amounts from other renewable sources. In 2009, the Russian energy industry generated a total 992TWh of electricity, 176TWh of which was produced by hydroelectric power stations. Some of Russia's hydroelectric power plants are outdated and are in need of additional investment, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> accident at the Sayano-Shushenskaya HPP in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Some {{specimens}} of M. yaotunensis preserve {{traces of the}} reddish brown pigment protoporphyrin and the blue-green pigment biliverdin, the same pigments used in the eggs of many modern birds. The eggs were most likely an intense blue-green color, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> predominance of biliverdin in the shell. The purpose of the coloration is uncertain, but in modern birds it can serve as coloration or as a post-mating sexual signal. Colored eggs are also correlated with active paternal care in modern birds, lending further support to the hypothesis that oviraptorid males cared for their eggs.|$|E

30|$|Although the {{calculated}} molecular {{mass of the}} mature protein was 24.6 kDa, the approximate size of the His-tagged protein was 36 kDa <b>as</b> <b>showed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. This discrepancy is apparently related to the acidic nature of the protein (16.9 % glutamate and aspartate compared to 8.7 % lysine and arginine and histidine). The predominance of acidic residues in most proteins results in their abnormal behavior during SDS-PAGE (Izotova et al., 1983).|$|R

5|$|Tea: The tea {{plant is}} {{indigenous}} to western Yunnan; {{by the mid}} 2nd millennium BC, tea was being consumed in Yunnan for medicinal purposes. Tea drinking was already an established custom in the daily life in this area <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Contract with a Slave, written by Wang Bao in 59 BC. This written record also reveals that tea was processed and used as a drink instead of a medicinal herb, emerged no later than the 1st century BC. Early Chinese tea culture began {{from the time of}} Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) to the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420–589) when tea was widely used by Chinese gentry, but only took its initial shape during the Tang Dynasty (618–907).|$|E
5|$|The felsic shield-building stage {{began with}} the {{eruption}} of phonolite, trachyte, phonolitic trachyte, quartz-trachyte and rhyolite lava. Subsequent volcanism of the pre-explosive phase produced a basal sequence of aphyric trachyte lava flows and domes with minor altered flow-banded rhyolite, sulfide-bearing rhyolitic tuffs and a few thin hawaiite lava flows. This activity was concentrated at {{the summit of the}} volcano <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> increasing thickness of volcanic material towards the summit. A hydrothermally altered aphyric trachyte dike, which forms a narrow ridge linking Mount Downton and Itcha Mountain, might have been the source for these eruptions.|$|E
5|$|The king, while Catholic, {{was very}} {{tolerant}} {{and did not}} support the more aggressive policies of the Counter-Reformation. When he took power, the Senate of Poland had 6 Protestant members; {{at the time of his}} death, it had 11. Despite his support for religious tolerance, he did fail, however, to resolve the conflict stemming from the Union of Brest split. Despite his support for the Protestants, he did not stop the growing tide of intolerance, either in Poland or abroad, <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fate of the Racovian Academy, or an international disagreement between the faiths. Neither did he get involved with the disagreement about the Orthodox Cossacks, a group that he respected and counted on in his plans.|$|E

5|$|The {{plants and}} animals which live on Solsbury Hill reflect the habitat {{provided}} by grassland overlying the limestone rock beneath. Specialist {{plants and animals}}, {{some of which are}} rare species, have adapted to the calcareous grassland. Most of the landscape is largely unaffected by agriculture <b>as</b> <b>shown</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> yellow meadow ant. Examples of plant species found include bird's foot trefoil, vetches, greater knapweed, harebells, yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and scabious.

The plants attract a range of insects including: the six-spotted burnet moth, hummingbird hawk-moth and a number of butterflies including chalkhill blues. A small population of common buzzard (Buteo buteo) nest in the area. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), badger and red fox are also seen. The skylark also nests on the hill.|$|E
