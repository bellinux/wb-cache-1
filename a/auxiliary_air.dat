5|$|During the Battle of Britain, between July and October 1940, RAF Fighter Command at RAF Bentley Priory {{received}} air threat {{warnings that}} it filtered to remove duplication, doubt and confusion. These were then forwarded to the Operations Room at RAF Uxbridge, which allocated appropriate defence resources and passed orders on to No. 11 Group sector airfields.

5|$|Initially, the {{operations}} room at RAF Uxbridge was disturbed by {{a visit from}} Prime Minister Winston Churchill.

However, at 10:30 the first German aircraft triggered the alarm at Chain Home radar station at Dover. The filter room at Stanmore recognised the formation as hostile. The WAAF detailed group and sector commands throughout the south that 40-plus enemy aircraft were entering Kentish airspace.|$|E
