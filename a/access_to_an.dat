In Halo 3, players can carry single-use equipment power-ups that offer temporary offensive or defensive advantages.

The abilities are a jetpack; active camouflage; sprint; hologram, which creates a facsimile of the player running towards a target point; drop shield, which creates a bubble that heals those inside and protects them from {{a limited amount of}} damage; and armor lock, which immobilizes the player but grants invincibility for a brief period of time. When playing as Covenant Elites, players also have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> evade armor ability.|$|E

5|$|There is {{only one}} early {{manuscript}} of Y Gododdin, the Book of Aneirin, thought to date from {{the second half of}} the 13th century. The currently accepted view is that this manuscript contains the work of two scribes, usually known as A and B. Scribe A wrote down 88 stanzas of the poem, then left a blank page before writing down four related poems known as Gorchanau. This scribe wrote the material down in Middle Welsh orthography. Scribe B added material later, and apparently had <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> earlier manuscript since the material added by this scribe is in Old Welsh orthography. Scribe B wrote 35 stanzas, some of which are variants of stanzas also given by Scribe A while others are not given by A. The last stanza is incomplete and three folios are missing from the end of the manuscript, so some material may have been lost.|$|E
