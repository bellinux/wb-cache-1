This method is then used to compute a bound of the <b>asymptotic</b> <b>unavailability</b> of a Markovian system. Finally, we show that calculating this dependability measure is of much interest even in di#erent contexts, since the unavailability at time t of several ageing systems can be e#ciently approximated by the <b>asymptotic</b> <b>unavailability</b> of an homogeneous Markov process. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: CASPA is a {{stochastic}} process algebra tool for performance and dependability mod-elling, analysis, and verification. It is based {{entirely on the}} symbolic data structure of the multi-terminal binary decision diagram (MTBDD) which enables the tool to handle models with very large state space. This paper describes an extension of CASPAâ€™s solving engine for path-based approximation of the mean time to first failure, the mean time to first recovery, and <b>asymptotic</b> <b>unavailability</b> by MTBDD algorithms. A non-trivial case study illustrates the use of path-based analysis and comparisons between the path-based unavailability calcula-tions and results obtained from standard Markovian analysis are presented...|$|E
