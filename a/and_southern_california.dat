5|$|Steamboats {{operated}} {{briefly on}} the large lakes of the upper basin, contributing {{to the growth of}} towns such as Klamath Falls, Oregon, before they were replaced by railroads in the late 19thcentury. In the 19th and 20thcenturies, the upper basin became a productive agricultural region, and many dams were built to provide irrigation and hydroelectricity. In the 1960s, the Klamath River was targeted by much larger, but ultimately unsuccessful schemes to augment water supplies in other parts of California. One of these projects, the Klamath Diversion, would have reversed the entire flow of the Klamath River to supply farms and urban areas in central <b>and</b> <b>southern</b> <b>California.</b>|$|E

5|$|Beetle-pollinated {{flowers are}} usually large, greenish or off-white in color, and heavily scented. Scents may be spicy, fruity, or similar to {{decaying}} organic material. Beetles {{were most likely}} the first insects to pollinate flowers. Most beetle-pollinated flowers are flattened or dish-shaped, with pollen easily accessible, although they may include traps to keep the beetle longer. The plants' ovaries are usually well protected from the biting mouthparts of their pollinators. The beetle families that habitually pollinate flowers are the Buprestidae, Cantharidae, Carambycidae, Cleridae, Dermestidae, Lycidae, Melyridae, Mordellidae, Nitidulidae and Scarabeidae. Beetles may be particularly important {{in some parts of}} the world such as semiarid areas of southern Africa <b>and</b> <b>southern</b> <b>California</b> and the montane grasslands of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Howard was a {{powerful}} Category 4 hurricane which produced large swells along the coasts of the Baja California Peninsula <b>and</b> <b>southern</b> <b>California.</b> The eighth named storm of the 2004 Pacific hurricane season, Howard originated out of a tropical wave {{off the coast of}} Mexico on August30. Traveling towards the northwest, the storm gradually strengthened, becoming a hurricane on September1 and reaching its peak intensity the following day with winds of 140mph (220km/h). Decreasing sea surface temperatures then caused the storm to weaken. By September4, Howard was downgraded to a tropical storm. The next day, it degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure area which persisted for another five days before dissipating over open waters.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, California State Engineer A.D.

However, major flooding in the 1950s prompted the 1957 passage of an emergency flood-control bill that provided sufficient funding for construction for a dam at Oroville – {{regardless of whether it}} would become part of the SWP.|$|E
5|$|Moisture {{derived from}} John also {{produced}} rainfall across southern New Mexico, peaking at 5.25inches (133mm) at Ruidoso. The rainfall overflowed rivers, forcing people to evacuate along the Rio Ruidoso. The rainfall also caused isolated road flooding. Rainfall in New Mexico canceled an annual wine festival in Las Cruces and caused muddy {{conditions at the}} All American Futurity at the Ruidoso Downs, the biggest day of horse racing in New Mexico. Flooding was severe in Mesquite, Hatch, and Rincon, where many homes experienced 4feet (1.5m) of flooding and mud. Some homeowners lost all they owned. Tropical moisture from the storm also produced rainfall in Arizona <b>and</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>California.</b> In California, the rainfall produced eight separate mudslides, trapping 19vehicles, but caused no injuries.|$|E

5|$|The storm's {{strengthening}} pattern {{continued until}} Hurricane Dean made its second and final landfall at 1630UTC August22 near Tecolutla, Veracruz, {{just east of}} Gutiérrez Zamora and about 40mi (65km) south-southeast of Tuxpan. A weather station at Requetemu, San Luis Potosí, recorded 15.4in (39cm) of rainfall during the storm's second landfall. Dean weakened rapidly, losing its low level circulation within hours and its mid-level circulation the next day as it encountered the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range. Its remnants passed over the mountains and into the eastern Pacific Ocean as a broad area of low pressure. Hurricane Dean's remnant low pressure system then drifted north into southern California, bringing thunderstorms to northern San Diego County, and more than 2in (5cm) of rain to Lake Wohlford. In Escondido almost 2in (5cm) of rain fell in 90minutes. The remnant low pressure system weakened over western Arizona <b>and</b> <b>southern</b> <b>California</b> before finally dissipating on August30.|$|E

5|$|Lactarius alnicola is an ectomycorrhizal species, and {{engages in}} a mutualistic {{association}} with certain plant species. In this association, the hyphae of the fungus permeate {{large volumes of}} soil and obtain scarce elements, especially phosphorus—which is often limiting for plant growth—which they pass on to the plant in exchange for metabolic products of the plant's photosynthesis. The ectomycorrhizae that the fungus forms in association with Picea engelmannii {{have been shown to}} contain lactifers (latex-producing cells) and pigments similar to the fruit body. Fruit bodies of the fungus grow in groups on the ground under alders and conifers, usually appearing between July and October. It is a fairly common species in the western United States and Baja California. Additional collection locations in Mexico include Veracruz, Villarreal, and Tapia. A population in central <b>and</b> <b>southern</b> <b>California</b> is known to associate with oak trees. In the Rocky Mountains it is associated with the subalpine tree species Englemann Spruce (Picea engelmannii), while at lower elevations it is commonly found with white spruce (Picea glauca). It is also known to associate with Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (genus Pseudotsuga). The mushroom has also been collected from Bageshwar, in the state of Uttarakhand, India.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that almost all California coastal steelhead are of native origin, despite over a century of {{hatchery}} stocking. Genetic analysis shows that the South Central California Coast DPS <b>and</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>California</b> DPS from Malibu Creek north, and including the San Gabriel River, Santa Ana River and San Mateo Creek, are not hatchery strains. Steelhead from Topanga Creek and the Sweetwater River were partly, and those from San Juan Creek completely, of hatchery origin. Genetic analysis has also shown that the steelhead in the streams of the Santa Clara County and Monterey Bay basins are not of hatchery origin, including the Coyote Creek, Guadalupe River, Pajaro River, Permanente Creek, Stevens Creek, San Francisquito Creek, San Lorenzo River, and San Tomas Aquino Creek basins. Natural waterfalls and two major dams have isolated Russian River steelhead from freshwater rainbow trout forms above the impassable barriers; a 2007 genetic study of fin samples collected from steelhead at 20 different sites both above and below passage barriers in the watershed found that although 30million hatchery trout were stocked in the river from 1911 to 1925, the steelhead remain of native and not hatchery origin.|$|E
5|$|By {{winning the}} PCC Northern Division, Oregon {{earned the right}} to play the winner of the Southern Division in a best-of-three playoff series, with the games held at McArthur Court. In {{addition}} to the PCC championship, the winner would gain a berth in the first NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, which the National Association of Basketball Coaches would run. The series was slated to be held between March 10–13, but a tie between California <b>and</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>California</b> for first place in the Southern Division necessitated a one-game playoff. Rumors began that the PCC championship series would be postponed by one week, which would have prevented the winner from competing in the NCAA Tournament; the event was scheduled to begin on March 20. In response, Oregon declared that they would not play if the series was scheduled to end after March 14. Despite the school's claim, it agreed to a rescheduling approved by PCC member schools, in which the series was set for March 16–18. Hobson declared that Oregon would accept an invitation to the NCAA Tournament, following hints that the PCC champion might be passed over for a bid in favor of a PCC team that did not receive a shortened rest between games. California won the Southern Division playoff 42–36 over Southern California to become the Webfoots' opponent in the PCC championship series. Dick later noted that he considered it vital for Oregon to sweep the Golden Bears in two games, to avoid an overnight trip to San Francisco for the NCAA Tournament and secure an off day in the Webfoots' schedule.|$|E
