50|$|Circular Hakafot are {{a symbol}} of {{perfection}} and unity, or sometimes {{a symbol of}} communal cooperation, and are cultural practices of different peoples. In the United States, Native Americans prayed for rain or the defeat of enemies while they danced in circles around images of their gods. According to the story told in the Book of Joshua, the People of Israel (Israelites) walked around the city of Jericho once {{a day for a}} week and seven times on the seventh day, with the priests leading the way, carrying the Ark of the Covenant each time. On the seventh day, the people blew ram's horns' and shouted, causing the walls to fall and allowing them to enter the city.

5000|$|The 707-320 Intercontinental is a {{stretched}} {{version of the}} turbojet-powered 707-120, initially powered by JT4A-3 or JT4A-5 turbojets producing 15,800 lb (70.3 kN) each (most eventually got 17,500 lb (78.4 kN) JT4A-11s). The interior allowed up to 189 passengers, {{the same as the}} -120 and -220 series, but improved two-class capacity due to an 80-in fuselage stretch ahead of the wing (from 138 ft to 145 ft [...] ), with extensions to the fin and horizontal stabilizer extending the aircraft's length further. The longer wing carried more fuel, increasing range by 1600 mi and allowing the aircraft to operate as true transoceanic aircraft. The wing modifications included outboard and inboard inserts, as well as a kink in the trailing edge to <b>add</b> <b>area</b> inboard. Takeoff weight was increased to 302000 lb initially and to 312000 lb with the higher-rated JT4As and center section tanks. Its first flight was on January 11, 1958; 69 turbojet 707-320s were delivered through January 1963, the first passengers being carried (by Pan Am) in August 1959.|$|E
50|$|As {{understanding}} of thermal soaring {{grew in the}} 1930s, glider pilots and designers became aware of two conflicting requirements for cross country flights. The aircraft needed good climb characteristics and low stalling speeds to enable tight turns within thermals but high speeds in the sinking air between them. These respectively called for low and high wing loadings on wings with high and low camber. Several designs, e.g. the 1938 Akaflieg Hannover AFH-4 and the later LET L-13 Blaník and Beatty-Johl BJ-2, had added large area slotted Fowler flaps on the inner part of the wing to increase camber and <b>add</b> <b>area</b> when extended. These satisfactorily reduced stall speed {{and with it the}} turn radius, but disappointed hopes of improving climb rates because of vortex generation (induced drag) at the tips of the flaps, seriously decreasing the lift to drag ratio. A solution to this problem was to extend the whole trailing edge, including the ailerons, and this route was taken by both the disappointing, heavy and complicated Operation Sigma Sigma, the more successful but still heavy and complex Akaflieg München Mü27 and the World Championship winning 15 m class Akaflieg Braunschweig SB-11.|$|E
40|$|State {{elements}} are increasingly vulnerable to soft errors {{due to their}} decreasing size, {{and the fact that}} latched errors cannot be completely eliminated by electrical or timing masking. Most prior methods of reducing the soft-error rate (SER) involve combinational redesign, which tends to <b>add</b> <b>area</b> and decrease testability, the latter a concern due to the prevalence of manufacturing defects. Our work explores the fundamental relations between the SER of sequential circuits and their testability in scan mode, and appears {{to be the first to}} improve both through retiming. Our retiming methodology relocates registers so that 1) registers become less observable with respect to primary outputs, thereby decreasing overall SER, and 2) combinational nodes become more observable with respect to registers (but not with respect to primary outputs), thereby increasing scantestability. We present experimental results which show an average decrease of 42 % in the SER of latches, and an average improvement of 31 % random-pattern testability...|$|E

40|$|This work {{refers to}} the analysis, study and {{resolution}} of the mathematical problem involved {{in the design and}} construction of the cover of a ball, such as the ones used in sports, in order to achieve a ball with optimal roundness and sphericity factors. The design of well distributed ball structures has grown in importance in the last years, most of all in the field of sports, such as soccer. The current trend is directed mainly towards finding a fast ball that will give more dynamism to the game. In order to achieve a greater velocity of the ball during its movement it is important that it has not only an adequate distribution of panels, that give it a greater sphericity, but also that it has a structure that allows for a good distribution of the existing tension between the panels. Starting from an initial design, we define a process of readjustment of the panels in the ball cover, which will lead us to obtain optimal sphericity factors. Then, through a “twisting” process, we can <b>add</b> <b>area</b> to the surface without altering the sphericity factors, and solving the Missing Area Problem (or MAP). Finally, by redefining the final form of the panels, we propose tessellate strategies that will optimize the ball’s spherical structure...|$|E
