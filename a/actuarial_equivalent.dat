X n independent, identically distributed, and observations x 1, X 2 [...] . x n, Estimate: parameter (or function thereof) of the distribution function common to all Xi. It {{is not surprising that}} the "classical actuary” has mostly been involved in solving the <b>actuarial</b> <b>equivalent</b> of this problem in insurance, namely Given: risks R 1 R 2 [...] . Rn no contagion, homogeneous group, Find: the proper (common) rate for all risks in the given class. There have, of course, always been actuaries who have questioned the assumptions of independence (no contagion) and/or identical distribution (homogeneity). As long as ratemaking is considered equivalent to the determination of the mean, there seem to be no additional difficulties if the hypothesis of independence is dropped. But is there a way to drop the condition of homogeneity (identical distribution) ...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionToday, c/s is {{performed}} as a usual surgery. Not only {{it involves a}} lot of facilities, hospital beds, and specialists, but also risk of death for mother and baby is more than natural childbirth. This study intends to investigate the prevalence and causes of cesarean section in Yazd Province {{as a first step}} to reduce caesarean section. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Yazd province during one year. Using regulatory forms, all the indications and deliveries for cesarean were reviewed. The Population was 24, 407 people, according to which <b>actuarial</b> <b>equivalent</b> samples were studied in this study. Data were analyzed by spss software. Results: The results showed 44. 5 /. of all deliveries were done with Cesarean section in which 74 / of them were non-emergency and 26. 5 % were emergency cases. Moreover, the reasons of Caesarean section were investigated and results indicated that the most common reason in non-emergency cases were previous caesareans, whereas regarding emergency caesareans, it was fetal distress. Conclusion: The present study reveals high rates of caesarean section in comparison with global statistics. Therefore, it is necessary to provide the necessary trainings and increase awareness of the complications of cesarean delivery to decrease it...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} spread {{notional}} capital accrued at retirement {{by members of}} a cohort over life expectancy, pay-as-you-go notional-defined-contribution (payg-ndc) scheme uses multipliers (different by retirement age) called conversion coefficients. These are backward-looking (b. l.) in that they relay on survival rates observed for previous cohorts in the past. Under increasing longevity, b. l. coefficients undervalue life expectancy, thus preventing full implementation of <b>actuarial</b> fairness (benefits <b>equivalent</b> to contributions) which is the main objective of ndc scheme. They also engender chronic deficits. Forward-looking (f. l.) coefficients, relaying on survival rates forecast for the cohort whom coefficients themselves are assigned to, can improve actuarial fairness. Nevertheless, they face a rather serious political difficulty in that forecasting tools are fallible. This explains why switching to f. l. coefficients is unable to gain social consensus. Abstracting from this, the paper shows that forward-looking coefficients produce ‘overshooting’. In fact, they generate chronic surpluses. The paper also shows that frontloading pension profile helps sustainability because it reduces both surpluses and deficits generated, respectively, by f. l. and b. l. approaches...|$|R
40|$|Risk {{measures}} have been studied for several decades in the actuarial literature, where they appeared {{under the guise of}} premium calculation principles. Risk measures and properties that risk measures should satisfy have recently received considerable at- tention in the financial mathematics literature. Mathematically, a risk measure is a mapping from a class of random variables defined on some measurable space to the (extended) real line. Economically, a risk measure should capture the preferences of the decision-maker. In incomplete financial markets, prices are no more unique but depend on the agents' attitudes towards risk. This paper complements the study initiated in Denuit, Dhaene & Van Wouwe (1999) and considers several theories for decision under uncertainty: the classical expected utility paradigm, Yaari's dual approach, maximin expected utility theory, Choquet expected utility theory and Quiggin rank-dependent utility theory. Building on the <b>actuarial</b> <b>equivalent</b> utility pricing principle, broad classes of risk measures are generated, of which most classical risk measures appear to be particular cases. This approach shows that most risk measures studied recently in the financial literature disregard the utility concept (i. e. correspond to linear utilities), causing some deficiencies. Some alternatives proposed in the literature are discussed, based on exponential utilities.
