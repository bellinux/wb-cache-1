5000|$|Adam {{is immune}} to any injury, and cannot be harmed by any weapon or attack, {{including}} psychic attack. Attempts by his daughter Kay {{to read his}} mind, in fact, result in pain for her, because of the [...] "clairvoyant insight" [...] he has developed due to his advanced age. He almost never feels pain, with two exceptions: When he senses {{when one of his}} children has died or is led to believe by his precognitive abilities that one of his children's death is imminent, and when Vincent, under the possession of an interdimensional demons, attacked him with mystical energy. He does not require nourishment, can survive in the vacuum of outer space, and does not need to sleep. While he is visible in the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum perceivable to humans, he is invisible to scans using higher wavelengths. Because Adam's abilities are magical in origin, he appears to the Silver Surfer's cosmic senses to be human, without any biological or mechanical enhancements that the Surfer can perceive. He even lacks a scent that can be detected by the X-Man Wolverine, whom he met at some point in his travels. Having watched his children grow old and die, he came to see his long existence as a curse, and finds that because of his invulnerability, his senses are numbed, and he feels neither pleasure nor pain. Adam even asked the Silver Surfer if he knew how he could die. Dominic has observed that Adam no longer exhibits the basic responses of survival instinct, such as scanning his surroundings or flinching in <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> <b>danger,</b> never twitching nor fidgeting because he never tires. Adam concedes that this gives only a vague awareness of what he touches. Dominic feels that what is worse is Adam's emotional detachment, his lack of expression, and aloofness, as if he is bored with human existence, and feels Adam is not applying the great intellect he accumulated over eight centuries to himself. Adam felt that Elalyth never forgave him for killing Vincent, but Albert did not believe this, pointing out that he still had her protection of immortality, though Adam feared that this was so that he could live a life tortured by guilt. He was reunited with Elalyth in ClanDestine (Vol. 2) #5.|$|E
40|$|Anxiety ” is a {{key term}} for behavioral, psychoanalytic, neuroendocrine, and psychopharmacological {{observations}} and theories. Commenting on its historical aspects is difficult, since history is properly a study of primary data. Unfortunately, much clinical anecdote does not correspond to factual records of a long time ago. Even reports of objective studies may suffer from allegiance effects. This essay therefore primarily reflects the personal impact of others ’ work {{against the background of}} my experiences, clinical and scientific. These lead me to question the assumption that “anxiety, ” as it exists in syndromal disturbances, is simply the quantitative extreme of the normal “anxiety ” that occurs during the <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> <b>danger.</b> An alternative view that emphasizes dysfunctions of distinct evolved adaptive alarm systems is presented...|$|E
40|$|Today's {{society is}} full of {{instructions}} and mandatory actions relating to safety or the <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> <b>danger.</b> Countless security instructions detail procedures to avoid any risk in the public space while double door entrances control access to {{a growing number of}} places. Our faces, bodies, fingerprints and pupils are repeatedly scanned. Western society is moving towards ultra-security, towards a refusal of the unexpected and an absolute desire for anticipation. The Safe and sound exhibition addresses this phenomenon through design, objects from everyday life, photography and contemporary art in four themes: security, fear, protection and surveillance. Mixing objects that meet a specific need for protection and the points of view of designers and artists, more critical and distanced but not devoid of humour, Safe and sound provides an exciting insight into this facet of our society. The exhibition features three design exhibits from Dr David Swann: ABC syringe, Ebola Bleach Dilution Gauge and the LifeHacket Trio...|$|E

In particular, JAs are critical for plant defense against herbivory and plant responses to poor environmental conditions and other kinds of abiotic and biotic challenges. Some JAs can also be released as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to permit communication between plants in <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> mutual <b>dangers.</b>|$|R
60|$|In <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> such a <b>danger,</b> a small spar {{had been}} erected upon the stump of the mizzen, and steadied with strong stays. Sail was now hoisted upon this, and an {{effort was made}} to bring the vessel's head to wind. Watching for a {{favorable}} moment between the passage of the heavy seas, the helm was put down and, slowly, her head came up into the wind. Under such sail, the captain had no hope of being able to reach out, in the teeth of the gale; but he hoped to be able to claw off the shore until clear of the land, which lay to leeward of him.|$|R
6000|$|Whilst {{they were}} thus speculating {{on the issue}} of the rencounter the valiant bonnet maker began to pull up Jezabel, in order that the smith, who he still {{concluded}} was close behind, might overtake him, and either advance first or at least abreast of himself. But when he saw him at a hundred yards distance, standing composedly with the rest of the group, the flesh of the champion, like that of the old Spanish general, began to tremble, in <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dangers</b> into which his own venturous spirit was about to involve it. Yet the consciousness of being countenanced by the neighbourhood of so many friends, the hopes that the appearance of such odds must intimidate the single intruder, and the shame of abandoning an enterprise in which he had volunteered, and when so many persons must witness his disgrace, surmounted the strong inclination which prompted him to wheel Jezabel to the right about, and return to the friends whose protection he had quitted, as fast as her legs could carry them. He accordingly continued his direction towards the stranger, who increased his alarm considerably by putting his little nag in motion, and riding to meet him at a brisk trot. On observing this apparently offensive movement, our hero looked over his left shoulder more than once, as if reconnoitring the ground for a retreat, and in the mean while came to a decided halt. But the Philistine was upon him ere the bonnet maker could decide whether to fight or fly, and a very ominous looking Philistine he was. His figure was gaunt and lathy, his visage marked by two or three ill favoured scars, and the whole man had much the air of one accustomed to say, [...] "Stand and deliver," [...] to a true man.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an activity-based framework for empirical discourse analysis of mitigation in public environments such as Swedish and Bulgarian courtroom examinations. Mitigation {{is defined as}} a pragmatic, cognitive and linguistic behavior the main purpose of which is reduction of vulnerability. The suggested framework consists of mitigation processes, which involve mitigating argumentation lines, defense moves, and communicative acts. The functions of mitigation are described in terms of the participants ’ actions and goals separately from politeness strategies. The conclusions and observations address two things: issues related to the pragmatic theory of communication especially mitigation and issues related to the trial as a social activity. For instance, non-turn-taking confirmations by examiners are often followed by volunteered utterances, which in some cases may be examples of ‘rehearsed ’ testimonies. At the same time the witnesses ’ tendency to volunteer information even on the behalf of their own credibility indicates that they also favor pro-party testimonies. Despite the objective judicial role of the prosecutor or judge and/or despite the examiners accommodating style the verbal behavior of the witnesses exhibits constant <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> <b>danger...</b>|$|E
40|$|It {{goes without}} saying that conference {{interpreting}} is a very stressful activity not least because it involves the performance of a series of complex cognitive and psychomotor operations in public or at least for the public. During the process of interpreting training the high levels of stress experienced by students when having to speak (interpret) in public can become one of the major obstacles in the early stages. Stress becomes evident through symptoms of anxiety currently defined by psychologists as a normal innate emotional alarm response to the <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> <b>danger</b> or threat. Anxiety emerges very soon during the early training stages even when students “only ” have to make monolingual presentations in front of their peers and teacher in language A or B. Those levels of anxiety do not decrease easily when monolingual presentations become real consecutive interpretations involving complex cognitive processes of language and cultural transfer. The climax is reached the day of the final consecutive interpreting examination where an attempt is made to simulate a real life situation at the University of Castellón. There are students who cannot stand the stress and abandon the exam moments before sitting it. Sometimes they even show physical symptoms (tears, difficulty in breathing, sickness, etc.). Many interpretation teachers feel they have to turn into ad hoc psychotherapists during office hours, trying to allay students ’ terrors of interpreting even after ordinary class sessions. The capacity to control stress has traditionally been considered one of the requisites for interpreting (Cooper, Davies and Tung 1982; Moser-Mercer 1985...|$|E
40|$|Our study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} extroversive disorders during childhood and later delinquent behavior in adulthood. In this context, the ascertainment of autonomous and psycho-physiological parameters is of great significance. Diminished willingness to respond in CD children with and without ADHD {{as well as in}} antisocial adults produces reliable and in part similar findings. Psychometric self and third-party assessment tests using standard forms were additionally drawn upon. Our results showed a diminished skin conductance reaction and a lack of startle reflex potentiation when viewing negative and/or positive pictures. Precisely the weakened skin conductance reaction to all emotional stimuli points unavoidably to a condition of being unemotionally cold, e. g. lack of anxiety or lack of empathy, as in CD children with or without ADHD. One study which confirms this fact is from Hare 1978 and Raine 1997. This proved that psychopaths, even in <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> <b>danger,</b> exhibited no deviation in their barely existent experience of anxiety, which is best seen in the electrodermal parameter (Arnett 1997). According to our results, a diminished sense of emotion represents a common characteristic in our CD children with and without ADHD and in psychopaths and can thus be seen as a valid risk factor in our clinical group for the development of delinquency in adulthood. In the psychometric tests, especially with the CBCL externalising scale, it was confirmed that an obviously increased aggressive behaviour emanates from CD children with and without ADHD. This result, however, is surely to be considered somewhat carefully, as one cannot say, from whom more aggressiveness emanates; from children with only CD or from the combination of DS with ADHD. All in all, tendencies are exhibited in the children we examined with a dysfunction in social behaviour with or without ADHD, which can be used valid risk factor indicators for the development of delinquency in adulthood. Biological or social factors (Venables 1987), which may not be ignored in our class society, could {{play a role in the}} incidence of dissociality. In contrast to earlier studies, a study by Löhrer from the year 2003 showed in a direct comparison between children with ADHD and ADHD+CD, that there was no indication of an increased risk for later delinquent behaviour in the ADHD group. The fact that, prior to Löhrer’s study, the combination of ADHD and CD had not been considered, could be an explanation for this discrepancy. This makes clear how important the unambiguous assignment to the differing extroversive dysfunctions during childhood and adolescence is, in order to be able to discuss a later dissociality...|$|E
6000|$|Now, {{you know}} that, {{among the best}} and wisest of our present {{religious}} teachers, there is a gradual tendency to disbelieve, and to preach their disbelief, in the commonly received ideas of the Devil, and of his place, and his work.

One of the last appearances in public of the author of the 'Christian Year' was at a conclave of clergymen assembled in defense of faith in damnation.[A] The sense of the meeting generally was, that there must be such a place as hell, because no one would ever behave decently upon earth unless they were kept in wholesome fear of the fires beneath it: and Mr. Keble, especially insisting on this view, related a story of an old woman who had a wicked son, and who, having lately heard with horror of the teaching of Mr. Maurice and others, exclaimed pathetically, [...] "My son is bad enough as it is, and if he were not afraid of hell, what would become of him!"

5000|$|That popping {{balloons}} {{is central}} to several popular party games suggests that enjoyment of the act, the challenge, and the <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> popping {{is not confined to}} fetishists.

This helps to explain why even non-poppers who have an intense phobia of balloons popping in non-sexual contexts may be aroused by the possibility within safe sexual contexts. It may even suggest that balloon fetish, for poppers and non-poppers alike, is part of the BDSM spectrum of fetishes in which a controlled amount <b>of</b> <b>danger</b> is used to elicit a pleasurable fight-or-flight response in participants.|$|R
60|$|Versailles {{reminds us}} of a {{singular}} overstatement by Sir Henry Maine of the blindness of the privileged classes in France to {{the approach of the}} Revolution. He speaks as if Lord Chesterfield's famous passage were the only <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> the coming <b>danger.</b> There is at least one utterance of Louis XV. himself, which shows that he did not expect things to last much beyond his time. D'Argenson, in the very year of Chesterfield's prophecy, pronounced that a revolution was inevitable, and he even went so close to the mark as to hint that it would arise on the first occasion when it should be necessary to convoke the States General. Rousseau, in a page of the Confessions, not only divined a speedy revolution, but enumerated the operative causes of it with real precision. There Is a striking prediction In Voltaire, and another in Mercier de la Rivière. Other names might be quoted to the same effect, including Maria Theresa, who described the ruined condition of the French monarchy, and only hoped that the ruin might not overtake her daughter. The mischief was not so much that the privileged classes were blind as that they were selfish, stubborn, helpless, and reckless. The point is not very important in itself, but it is characteristic of a very questionable way of reading human history. Sir Henry Maine's readiness to treat revolutions as due to erroneous abstract ideas naturally inclines him to take too narrow a view both of the preparation in circumstances, and of the preparation in the minds of observant onlookers.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> pain may modulate spatial attention. However, it is possible that this modulation reflects a general effect of anticipating somatosensory stimulation, without being pain-specific. In the present study, we therefore compared the effect <b>of</b> the <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> somatosensory stimulation on spatial attention between two groups, using conditioned signals in a spatial cueing paradigm. In the pain group, signals predicted painful electrocutaneous stimulation, whereas in the control group, signals predicted non-painful vibrotactile stimulation. Tests between both groups showed that attentional engagement was equally facilitated by the <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> somatosensory stimulation in both groups. Interestingly, disengagement of attention was more retarded by the <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> pain than by the <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> non-painful vibrotactile stimulation in participants high in catastrophic thinking about pain.

40|$|While {{the concept}} of “expected utility ” informs many {{theories}} of decision making, {{little is known about}} whether and how the human brain might compute this quantity. This article reviews a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) experiments designed to localize brain regions that respond in <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> increasing amounts of monetary incentives. These studies collectively suggest that <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> increasing monetary gains activates a subcortical region of the ventral striatum in a magnitude-proportional manner. This ventral striatal activation is not evident during <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> losses. Actual gain outcomes instead activate a region of the mesial prefrontal cortex. During <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> gain, ventral striatal activation is accompanied by feelings characterized by increasing arousal and positive valence. These findings affirm the role of emotion in the <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> incentives, and may provide an initial step towards a neural reconstruction of expected utility...|$|R

40|$|Reward related {{behaviour}} {{is linked}} to dopaminergic neurotransmission. Our aim was to gain insight into dopaminergic involvement in the human reward system. Combining {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} with dopaminergic depletion by α-methylparatyrosine we measured dopamine-related brain activity in 10 healthy volunteers. In addition to blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast we assessed the effect of dopaminergic depletion on prolactin response, peripheral markers for dopamine and norepinephrine. In the placebo condition we found increased activation in the left caudate and left cingulate gyrus during <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> reward. In the α-methylparatyrosine condition there was no significant brain activation during <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> reward or loss. In α-methylparatyrosine, <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> reward vs. loss increased activation in the right insula, left frontal, right parietal cortices and right cingulate gyrus. Comparing placebo versus α-methylparatyrosine showed increased activation in the left cingulate gyrus during <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> reward and the left medial frontal gyrus during <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> loss. α-methylparatyrosine reduced levels of dopamine in urine and homovanillic acid in plasma and increased prolactin. No significant effect of α-methylparatyrosine was found on norepinephrine markers.

40|$|Underlying {{the study}} of animal welfare is the {{assumption}} that animals experience emotional states. Although there has been a bias towards studying negative emotions, research into positive emotions is necessary for an overall welfare assessment. The aim of the current study was to find behavioural expressions specific for <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> different events in domestic fowl, Gallus gallus omesticus. To this aim, we used a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm by which we induced <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> a positive, neutral and negative event. We investigated whether birds were able to discriminate between sound cues signalling these events with different valences and, if so, whether <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> different events is reflected in different behavioural responses. The birds showed a response of increased attention to all sound cues. In <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> the negative event, the birds showed more head movements and locomotion than in <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> both the neutral and positive event, possibly reflecting the aversive nature of the negative event. In <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> the positive event, the birds showed more comfort behaviours, such as preening and wing flapping, which have been associated with a state of relaxation. Our study shows that laying hens are able to anticipate differentially a positive, neutral and negative event announced by different sound cues. It is also the first study to identify comfort behaviours as specifically associated with <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> a positive event in domestic fowl. Comfort behaviours may therefore be associated with a positive emotional state in domestic fowl...|$|R
