5|$|Juan José Castelli was {{the main}} speaker for the revolutionaries. He based his speech on two key ideas: the government's lapsed legitimacy—he stated that the Supreme Central Junta was {{dissolved}} and had no rights to designate a Regency—and the principle of retroversion of sovereignty. He spoke after Riega, and replied that the American people should <b>assume</b> <b>control</b> of their government until FerdinandVII could return to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Aspiring {{musician}} and scenester Bob Markley managed {{to join the}} group the Laughing Wind {{in exchange for his}} connections in the music industry and substantial bankroll. The original five-piece line-up consisted of Michael Lloyd (rhythm guitar, vocals), Shaun Harris (bass guitar, vocals, Danny Harris (lead guitar, vocals), John Ware (drums), and Markley (tambourine, vocals). Although Markley possessed the least musical talent, his expertise in law enabled him to <b>assume</b> <b>control</b> of the group's name and publishing, which generated a divide in the WCPAEB's creative mindset.|$|E
5|$|Central Area was disbanded in August 1941 and its {{responsibilities}} divided between Southern Area, Northern Area, {{and the newly}} formed No.2 (Training) Group. The outbreak of the Pacific War resulted in Northern Area being split in January 1942 into North-Western and North-Eastern Areas, to counter separate Japanese threats to Northern Australia and New Guinea. Southern Area was also considered appropriate for division owing to its size, so the Australian Air Board proposed assigning responsibility for operational and maintenance units within New South Wales to a new area command, Eastern Area, which would also <b>assume</b> <b>control</b> of units in southern Queensland from North-Eastern Area.|$|E

5|$|Stalin {{was very}} {{disappointed}} and infuriated by the early reports of heavy Soviet losses in the battle, and {{on the evening of}} 12 July he scolded Rotmistrov via a phone call. He considered sacking Rotmistrov and having him court-martialed, but ended up not doing so. The same evening, he dispatched Zhukov, who had been overseeing Operation Kutuzov, to Vatutin's headquarters as Stavka representative, in order to <b>assume</b> <b>control</b> of coordinating the operations of the Voronezh and Steppe Fronts.|$|E
5|$|The Last of Us is an action-adventure {{survival}} horror {{video game}} developed by Naughty Dog {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment. Players <b>assume</b> <b>control</b> of Joel (Troy Baker), escorting the young Ellie (Ashley Johnson) across a post-apocalyptic United States. The game's development was led by Bruce Straley and Neil Druckmann, as game director and creative director, respectively. The game was officially announced on December 10, 2011, and was widely anticipated. It was awarded Most Anticipated Game from PlayStation Universe and Cheat Code Central, receiving a nomination at the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards.|$|E

5|$|Although the Chronicle of Man {{maintains}} that Lǫgmaðr voluntarily vacated his throne, {{there is reason}} to suspect that he was forced from power. In about 1096, the chronicle claims that the leading Islesmen sought assistance of Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster (died 1119), and petitioned him to provide a regent from his own kin to govern the kingdom until Lǫgmaðr's younger brother, Óláfr (died 1153), was old enough to <b>assume</b> <b>control.</b> The chronicle's account could be evidence that, by about 1096, Lǫgmaðr faced a faction formed around his younger brother; and that, when this faction was unable to topple Lǫgmaðr by itself, it approached Ua Briain for assistance in placing Óláfr upon the throne.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} on 28 April or 29 April, General Gotthard Heinrici, Commander-in-Chief of Army Group Vistula, was {{relieved}} of his command after disobeying Hitler's direct orders to hold Berlin {{at all costs}} and never order a retreat, {{and was replaced by}} General Kurt Student. General Kurt von Tippelskirch was named as Heinrici's interim replacement until Student could arrive and <b>assume</b> <b>control.</b> There remains some confusion as to who was in command, as some references say that Student was captured by the British and never arrived. Regardless of whether von Tippelskirch or Student was in command of Army Group Vistula, the rapidly deteriorating situation that the Germans faced meant that Army Group Vistula coordination of the armies under its nominal command during the last few days of the war was of little significance.|$|E
5|$|By 1941, Göring was at {{the peak}} of his power and influence, and Hitler {{designated}} him as his successor and deputy in all his offices. As the Second World War progressed, Göring's standing with Hitler and with the German public declined after the Luftwaffe proved incapable of preventing the Allied bombing of German cities and resupplying surrounded German forces in Stalingrad. Around that time, Göring increasingly withdrew from the military and political scene to devote his attention to collecting property and artwork, much of which was taken from Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Informed on 22 April 1945 that Hitler intended to commit suicide, Göring sent a telegram to Hitler requesting permission to <b>assume</b> <b>control</b> of the Reich. Considering it an act of treason, Hitler removed Göring from all his positions, expelled him from the party, and ordered his arrest.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, the Storm Prediction Center, National Severe Storms Laboratory and National Weather Service Norman Forecast Office {{moved their}} {{respective}} operations into the newly constructed National Weather Center, near Westheimer Airport. Since the agency's relocation to Norman, the 557th Weather Wing at Offutt Air Force Base would <b>assume</b> <b>control</b> of issuing the Storm Prediction Center's severe weather {{products in the}} event that the SPC is no longer able to issue them {{in the event of an}} outage (such as a computer system failure or building-wide power disruption) or emergency (such as an approaching strong tornadic circulation or tornado on the ground) affecting the Norman campus; on April 1, 2009, the SPC reassigned responsibilities for issuing the center's products in such situations to the 15th Operational Weather Squadron based out of Scott Air Force Base.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the end of the war, Cilicia had also become a source of dispute between the British and French, who both aspired to establish influence in the region. The British government, however, was under strong domestic pressure to withdraw and demobilize its forces in the Middle East and on 15 September 1919, Prime Minister David Lloyd George begrudgingly accepted a proposal by Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau to have the French formally <b>assume</b> <b>control</b> of Cilicia. The transfer of command took place on 4 November, but Field Marshal Ferdinand Foch's promise to reinforce the existing forces in the area with at least 32 infantry battalions, 20 cavalry squadrons and 14 artillery batteries went unfulfilled. The French units were thus deprived of armored cars and air support and lacked automatic weapons, heavy artillery and even wireless transmitters and carrier pigeons.|$|E
5|$|Ryse: Son of Rome is an action-adventure hack and slash {{game played}} in a third-person perspective. Players <b>assume</b> <b>control</b> of Marius Titus, a Roman general who is on a quest to avenge his murdered family. Throughout the game, players gain access to weapons {{that can be used}} to assault enemies or defend themselves. For instance, players are {{equipped}} with a sword {{that can be used to}} strike and kill enemies, and a shield that can be used to deflect enemies' attack and break their defense. The strength of each attack can be decided by players. In addition to melee-based combat, the game features spears and javelins, which serve as ranged weapons.|$|E

5|$|Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a {{tactical}} shooter video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal {{and published by}} Ubisoft. It was released worldwide on December 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game puts heavy emphasis on environmental destruction and cooperation between players. Players <b>assume</b> <b>control</b> of an attacker or a defender in different gameplay modes such as hostage rescuing and bomb defusing. The title has no campaign, but features a series of short missions that can be played solo. These missions have a loose narrative, focusing on recruits going through training {{to prepare them for}} future encounters with the White Masks, a terrorist group that threatens the safety of the world.|$|E
5|$|When {{the emperor}} died without officially {{appointing}} a successor, his widow, the empress dowager, had the sole right to appoint {{one of the}} late emperor's surviving sons or relatives to the position. Most often the successor chosen in this fashion was a minor, thus the empress dowager served as regent over the government. A high-status male relative, usually a father or brother, would <b>assume</b> <b>control</b> of the Imperial Secretariat. Even when an emperor reached his majority and became an active ruler, he often sought the advice and acceptance of the empress dowager on policy decisions; she also {{had the right to}} override his decisions. The empress dowager was protected by the Minister of the Guards, yet if her faction—the consort clan— was removed from power, he was then responsible for keeping her under house arrest.|$|E
5|$|After a {{brief period}} of unemployment, he was hired as a master at the Collegiate School in Leicester to teach drawing, mapmaking, and surveying. Wallace spent many hours at the library in Leicester: he read An Essay on the Principle of Population by Thomas Malthus, and one evening he met the {{entomologist}} Henry Bates. Bates was 19 years old, and in 1843 he had published a paper on beetles in the journal Zoologist. He befriended Wallace and started him collecting insects. William died in March 1845, and Wallace left his teaching position to <b>assume</b> <b>control</b> of his brother's firm in Neath, but his brother John and he were unable to make the business work. After a few months, Wallace found work as a civil engineer for a nearby firm that was working on a survey for a proposed railway in the Vale of Neath.|$|E

5|$|As {{a student}} at Carnegie Mellon University in 2004, Druckmann was tasked with {{creating}} a video game concept to present to film director George A. Romero, who would select a winner. Druckmann's idea was to merge the gameplay of Ico (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968), with a lead character similar to John Hartigan from Sin City (1991–2000). The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to the lead character's heart condition, players would often <b>assume</b> <b>control</b> of the young girl, reversing the roles. Though the idea did not win, Druckmann later developed it when creating the story of The Last of Us. An early idea for the game was that the infection only spread to women, though this was later deemed misogynistic.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the festival Cosima received a long, critical memorandum from an unknown observer, which highlighted numerous divergences from Wagner's directions. This, says Marek, proved to be a critical factor in determining her future life's mission: the maintenance of Wagner's heritage creations through the preservation of his interpretations. In her seclusion, Cosima learned of an abortive plan masterminded by Julius Kniese, the festival's chorus-master, by which Liszt was to assume the role of music director and Bülow would be chief conductor. Neither Liszt nor Bülow was interested in this arrangement, and the plan died. With Groß's assistance, Cosima pre-empted any further attempts by outsiders to <b>assume</b> <b>control</b> of the Wagner legacy, by obtaining legal recognition of herself and Siegfried as sole heirs to all Wagner's property, physical and intellectual. By this means she secured an unassailable advantage over any other claim on direction of the festival's future.|$|E
5|$|At the time, much of {{the rural}} ricelands had been {{abandoned}} due to war and lay fallow. The Americans pressured Diem to <b>assume</b> <b>control</b> of such lands and distribute it to the new settlers and {{to allow them to}} start their new lives and ease the overcrowding in the camps, but no action was taken in 1954. At the time, there was a severe wastage of personnel due to the placement of refugees in land that was inappropriate to them. Vietnamese officials had resolved to place the settlers in land similar to their northern origins so that they could be productive, but bureaucratic difficulties hampered COMIGAL and no plan was produced. Throughout 1954, 60% of the new arrivals identified themselves as having an agrarian background, but only 20% of the total refugees were placed in arable farming areas, meaning that at least 40% of the northerners were in areas not appropriate for their skill set. There were also severe problems in finding and then distributing farming equipment to the northerners so that they could get to work and resuscitate the agricultural sector that was hindered by the war.|$|E
