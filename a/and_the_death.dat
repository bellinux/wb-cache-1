5|$|After Robert Baker's {{death in}} 1623 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of {{his eldest son}} Samuel shortly after, his widow and her father {{purchased}} the wardship of their surviving children; {{the death of the}} next eldest son, Robert, in 1630, allowed them to effectively control the estate. Their only daughter died and her widower, Sir Henry Oxenden, retained an interest in the land. Several relatives claimed it, but after Mary Baker's death in about 1665, the estate reverted to the Crown. A great-nephew, John Baker, obtained possession of part of it, but squabbled over the lands with his cousin, James Baker; trying to play one another off, they paid or granted rights to Oxenden and a speculator, Colonel Thomas Panton, but the pair eventually lost out to them. By the 1670s, Panton was developing the lands and, despite the claims of some distantly-related Bakers, he steadily built them up.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Frederick, the Kingdom was ruled by HenryVII of Germany and ConradIV of Germany. The next {{legitimate}} heir was ConradII, who was too young at the period to rule. Manfred of Sicily, the illegitimate son of Frederick, took the power and ruled the kingdom for fifteen years while other Hohenstaufen heirs were ruling various areas in Germany. After long wars against the Papal States, the Kingdom managed to defend its possessions, but the Papacy declared the Kingdom escheated because of disloyalty of the Hohenstaufen. Under this pretext he came to an agreement with LouisIX, King of France. Louis's brother, Charles of Anjou, would become king of Sicily. In exchange, Charles recognized the overlordship of the Pope in the Kingdom, paid {{a portion of the}} papal debt, and agreed to pay annual tribute to the Papal States. The Hohenstaufen rule in Sicily ended after the 1266 Angevin invasion <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of Conradin, the last male heir of Hohenstaufen, in 1268.|$|E

He intended to prosecute five Iranian officials, including former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, but Argentina signed a memorandum of understanding with Iran for a joint investigation. Nisman accused the president of signing that memorandum for oil and trade benefits, according to hundreds of hours of wiretaps. On 19 January 2015 he was found dead at his home, a day before a congressional hearing to explain his accusation, which caused a great controversy. As of 2016, both the cases of the AMIA bombing <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> of Nisman remain unresolved, and the courts declined at the time to investigate his denunciation of Kirchner.|$|E
