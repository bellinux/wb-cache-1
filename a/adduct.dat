Recently, a variety of new fluorescence, immunochemical, and radioactive-postlabeling procedures have been developed that allow the sensitive measurement of DNA-carcinogen <b>adducts</b> in organisms exposed to environmental carcinogens. In some cases, similar procedures have been developed for protein-carcinogen <b>adducts.</b> In an organism with active metabolic systems for a given carcinogen, <b>adducts</b> are generally much longer lived than the carcinogens that formed them. Thus, the detection of DNA- or protein-carcinogen <b>adducts</b> in aquatic foodstuffs can act as an indicator of prior carcinogen exposure. The presence of DNA <b>adducts</b> would, in addition, suggest a mutagenic/carcinogenic risk to the aquatic organism itself. Vertebrate fish are characterized by high levels of carcinogen metabolism, low body burdens of carcinogen, the formation of carcinogen-macromolecule <b>adducts,</b> and the occurrence of pollution-related tumors.

The manganese <b>adducts</b> were synthesized by dissolution of both, manganese chloride and glycine in water, whereas the copper <b>adducts</b> {{were obtained by}} using an alternative solid state synthesis approach. For all <b>adducts,</b> the obtained infrared data shows that the coordination involves the amine nitrogen atom, {{as well as an}} oxygen atom of the COO- group. The TG curves for the synthesized <b>adducts</b> exhibit only one mass loss step associated with the release of glycine molecules...|$|R
