5|$|The verbal prefix {{contains}} {{information about}} the person <b>and</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the subject, sometimes also the person <b>and</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the object, as well as obligatory {{information about the}} tense of the clause. Furthermore, a verbal suffix conveys further information regarding tense and aspect. While {{only a small number}} of tense and aspect affixes exist, the interplay between those in the verbal prefix and in the suffix, can generate more highly specified temporal and aspectual clauses.|$|E
5|$|A third {{theme of}} the work is the stress on the {{importance}} <b>and</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> distinguished burials that took place at Ely. They would have increased the desire of others to be buried there, which would have benefited the community by the donations that would have flowed from those wishing to secure their burial. The Liber stresses the burials of Æthelstan, a Bishop of Elmham, that of Ælfwine, another Bishop of Elmham, and Wulfstan II, an Archbishop of York.|$|E

Upon {{the return of}} the Electress Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici, daughter of the then reigning, Cosimo III, thus Violante Beatrice's sister-in-law, the Dowager Grand Princess contemplated retiring to her brother's court at Munich; however, Gian Gastone convinced her to stay, and Cosimo III appointed her Governor of Siena, where she then resided.

Immediate hazards related to cinder cone eruptions in the Nazko area would probably be forest fires and, if an eruption column were produced, redirection of nearby air traffic.|$|E

Its breeding season appears to run from spring through summer; nest building was observed in Belize in early May, and small young were found in a nest in Mexico in mid-August. The nest, an open cup of twigs lined with rootlets and other fine material, is placed low in a dense bush or small tree. The female lays two greenish-blue eggs.

5|$|On 27 May 2009, the Government {{announced}} that it would refine the size <b>and</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> GRCs.

Instead, when the next EBRC was appointed, its terms of reference would instruct the Committee to plan for fewer six-member GRCs than at present, and to reduce the average size of each GRC. The average size of GRCs at that time was 5.4 MPs because there were only five-member and six-member GRCs. The new average, however, would not exceed five MPs.|$|E
