25|$|According to the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations, Kennedy {{was waving}} to the crowds {{on his right}} with his right arm upraised {{on the side of}} the limo when a shot entered his upper back, {{penetrated}} his neck and slightly damaged a spinal vertebra and the top of his right lung. The bullet exited his throat nearly centerline just beneath his larynx and nicked the left side of his suit tie knot. He raised his elbows and clenched his fists in front of his face and neck, then leaned forward and left. Mrs. Kennedy, facing him, then put her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> in concern.|$|E
500|$|After President Nixon {{told his}} family he would resign {{the office of}} the presidency, she replied, [...] "But why?" [...] She {{contacted}} White House curator Clement Conger to cancel any further development of a new official china pattern from the Lenox China Company, and began supervising the packing of the family's personal belongings. On August 7, 1974, the family met in the solarium of the White House for their last dinner. Pat {{sat on the edge of}} a couch and held her chin high, a sign of tension to her husband. When the president walked in, she threw her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> kissed him, and said, [...] "We're all very proud of you, Daddy." [...] Later Pat Nixon said of the photographs taken that evening, [...] "Our hearts were breaking and there we are smiling." ...|$|E
2500|$|In On a Wing and a Prayer David Campese defended {{himself by}} stating that, [...] "...I did not {{deliberately}} try to {{slap the ball}} down when Winterbottom attempted to pass to Underwood in the second half. I was just worried about stopping Winterbottom and I tried to get man and ball by wrapping my <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> {{as well as the}} ball." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{held on to}} the bar, {{his legs}} {{wobbling}} under <b>him,</b> Martin's <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> and supporting him, while he thought.|$|R
60|$|She {{caught one}} <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> as his was around herself; the tremor ran {{from him to}} her; both sat dumb.|$|R
6000|$|... "You think Mr Blake is silly. He is a silly young man, I allow; but Mr Hall {{has been}} very civil. As I am to go there for a week, {{you might as well}} take me." [...] As she spoke she put her <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> caressing him.|$|R
2500|$|We {{approached}} the fortress. [...] At {{the head of}} a group of officers we saw a captain with a long white beard, who was flourishing his cane and dancing an impromptu jig. [...] The first man he met in the relief column was a bugler. [...] He threw his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> [...] Then he embraced the second bugler. [...] The band tried to keep its dignity, but to no avail. [...] He then abandoned the buglers and fell on the neck of the first drummer. [...] For a moment the drum stood between him and the object of his affections, but eventually he managed to plant two loud kisses on the drummer’s cheeks. [...] Then he made for the general-in-chief. [...] There was a sudden hush, as when an orchestra falls silent {{at the end of a}} dance. [...] He recovered himself, solemnly clicked his heels, and saluted General Brière de l’Isle. [...] We recognised Captain de Borelli.|$|E
2500|$|The {{continued}} {{absence of}} {{news from the}} expedition against Fort Caroline greatly concerned the Spaniards at St. Augustine. San Vicente, one of the captains who had remained behind, prophesied that Menéndez would never come back, and that the entire party would be killed. This impression was confirmed by the return of a hundred men made desperate by the hardships of the march, who brought with them their version {{of the difficulty of}} the attempt. On the afternoon of Monday, the 24th, just after the successful rescue of the French frigate, the settlers saw a man coming towards them, shouting {{at the top of his}} lungs. The chaplain went out to meet him, and the man threw his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> crying, [...] "Victory, victory! the harbor of the French is ours!" [...] On reaching St. Augustine, Menéndez at once armed two boats to send to the mouth of the St. Johns after Jacques Ribault, to prevent his reuniting with his father or returning to France with the news of the Spanish attack; but, learning that Jacques had already sailed, he abandoned his plan and dispatched a single vessel with supplies to Fort San Mateo.|$|E
2500|$|Nilsen {{was adamant}} he was {{uncertain}} {{as to why}} he had killed, simply saying [...] "I'm hoping you will tell me that" [...] when asked his motive for the murders. He was adamant the decision to kill was not made until moments before the actual act of murder. Most victims had been killed by strangulation, although on several occasions, he had drowned the victims once they had been strangled into unconsciousness. Once the victim had been killed, he would typically bathe the victim's body, shave any hair from the torso to conform the body to his physical ideal, then apply makeup to any obvious blemishes upon the skin. The body would usually be dressed in socks and underpants, before Nilsen would drape the victims' <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> as he talked to the corpse. With most victims, Nilsen would masturbate as he stood alongside or knelt above the body, and although Nilsen confessed to having occasionally engaged in intercrural sex with his victims' bodies, he repeatedly stressed to investigators he had never penetrated his victims — harking that his victims were [...] "too perfect and beautiful for the pathetic ritual of commonplace sex".|$|E

5000|$|In 1993, after {{a lengthy}} and highly publicized jury trial {{stemming}} from his involvement with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and its secret acquisition of First American Bankshares Inc., Altman was acquitted. Carter was seen on the TV news with her <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> declaring, [...] "Not guilty! Not guilty!" [...] to the gathered reporters.|$|R
60|$|The next instant Joe was by {{his side}} on the bunk, his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> Prompted by some instinctive monitor, {{he had done it}} before he thought. A week before he could not have {{imagined}} himself in such an absurd situation--his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> a boy; but now it seemed the most natural thing in the world. He did not comprehend, but he knew, whatever it was, that it was of deep importance to his companion.|$|R

60|$|She laughed suddenly, with a wild {{catch in}} her voice, and flung her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A season {{earlier in}} 1963, Darryl Hill of the University of Maryland {{was the first}} and only African-American {{football}} player in the ACC. According to Lee Corso, a Maryland assistant coach at that time, Wake Forest had [...] "the worst atmosphere" [...] of any campus the Maryland football team visited. Piccolo went over to the Maryland bench, walked Hill over to the area in front of the student section and put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> silencing the crowd.|$|R
6000|$|Her <b>arms</b> {{tightened}} <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> He {{looked down}} at her with a peculiar helplessness. Their light weight seemed to him like a chain of iron weighing him down! down! down! ...|$|R
60|$|But Olive put her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> and coaxed him for her sake to let {{the matter}} rest. And, finally, the captain, grumblingly, assented.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} help laughing, and he stood {{looking at me with}} such a {{whimsical}} expression that I rose and flung my <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... (Going to Tommy, and {{bending down}} with her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.)</b> No, Tommy. Mama {{has to go to}} that horrid dinner to-night. But to-morrow we'll play.|$|E
60|$|He made a final {{effort to}} retain his hold, {{and at the}} instant there was in his mind, as if he dreamed, a fancy that strong <b>arms</b> were <b>around</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|He stooped down, and her <b>arms</b> closed <b>around</b> <b>him</b> like a soft yoke. But {{he kissed}} her {{forehead}} so lightly that she scarcely {{realized that this was}} almost his first caress.|$|R
60|$|Walter half {{turned to}} see what part the Indian was {{to play in this}} interview, and as he did so the fellow's <b>arms</b> were <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> pinioning his own to his side.|$|R
6000|$|And {{the bright}} blade gleamed over Victoria's head.... He was struck down--blinded--half-stunned--but rose {{again with the}} energy of madness.... What was this? Soft <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him....</b> Victoria's! ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{rushed into}} his embrace, and {{throwing}} her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> {{buried her face}} upon his breast. 'Alaric, Alaric, my husband! my love, my best, my own, my only love!' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{sank back}} gently into his chair, {{and did not}} speak again. But it was some hours before he had ceased to breathe, with Mirah's and Deronda's <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
50|$|He is {{even said}} to create social vignettes with the toys. For example, {{the day after}} he first allowed his owner to put her <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> he placed a large bear with its <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> a smaller frog. Dr. Barbara Smuts, a {{professor}} of psychology and specialist in animal behavior at the University of Michigan who studied Donnie and captured his activities on video, suggests that these behaviors may be linked to self-entertainment, or to past experiences such as his time spent in a shelter for a year with only a single toy. In her view, there have not been enough examples of behavior like Donnie's, to decide scientifically what they may mean.|$|R
2500|$|Rumsfeld {{discusses}} the longtime problems of his son, Nick, with drug addiction. He recalls {{when his son}} checked into a rehab clinic shortly after 9/11, and Rumsfeld, overcome with emotion, breaks down {{in a meeting with}} Bush in the Oval Office. He writes, [...] "I had not imagined I might choke up... at that moment George W Bush wasn't just the president. He was a compassionate human being who had a sense of what Joyce and I were going through." [...] Rumsfeld states that Bush rose from the Presidential desk to put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> in understanding.|$|R
60|$|Willie's silent weeping {{turned to}} noise, {{and the two}} little girls, with the fresh ribbons in their hair, joined him. Tom's face was drawn and white, though the smitten cheek still blazed, and Saxon wanted to put her <b>arms</b> comfortingly <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> yet dared not. He bent over his wife.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{seems to}} be {{considerable}} hoist in it," [...] he said, directly. And then I put my <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> and found that I could raise him from the ground.|$|E

6000|$|He {{had a fit}} of coughing. Winifred {{passed her}} <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> and held him up. [...] "If you stay," [...] she whispered to Hefferom, [...] "you will kill him. He ought not to speak ever a sentence." ...|$|E
