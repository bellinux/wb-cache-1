25|$|Despite {{their lack}} of graphics, text adventures include a {{physical}} dimension where players move between rooms. Many text adventure games boasted their total number of rooms to indicate how much gameplay they offered. These games are unique in that they may create an illogical space, where going north from area A takes you to <b>area</b> <b>B,</b> but going south from <b>area</b> <b>B</b> did not {{take you back to}} area A. This can create mazes that do not behave as players expect, and thus players must maintain their own map. These illogical spaces are much more rare in today's era of 3D gaming, and the Interactive Fiction community in general decries the use of mazes entirely, claiming that mazes have become arbitrary 'puzzles for the sake of puzzles' and that they can, in the hands of inexperienced designers, become immensely frustrating for players to navigate.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{the oldest}} {{terminal}} building still standing is Terminal 2, completed in 1954 as the Central Terminal with four concourses (Piers B, C, D, and E, lettered sequentially {{from north to}} south). Terminal 1 was added as the South Terminal in 1963 with Piers F/FF (Pier F had two satellite rotundas) and G, and Pier E was reassigned to the South Terminal upon its completion. International traffic was routed through Pier G, and a new Rotunda G was completed in 1974 to expand Pier G. Terminal 3 was added as the North Terminal in 1979 with Pier A. Also once the North Terminal was completed in 1979, the piers were renamed counterclockwise, with letter designations corresponding to present-day Boarding Areas, starting with Pier A (present-day Boarding Area A, originally Pier G), Pier B (present-day Boarding <b>Area</b> <b>B,</b> originally Pier F/FF), and Pier C (present-day Boarding Area C, originally Pier E). A new Pier E {{was added to the}} North Terminal in 1981 approximately where the old Pier B stood, and the Central Terminal was rebuilt with a single pier (D) to serve international flights in 1983, until a new International Terminal opened in 2000. Since then, the terminals were renamed with numbers in 2001, and the older terminals {{are in the process of}} renovation. A rebuild of Terminal 2 (formerly the Central Terminal) completed in 2011, followed by the completed rebuild of Terminal 3 (North Terminal) in 2015, and a projected rebuild of Terminal 1 (South Terminal) is scheduled to be complete by 2024.|$|E

30|$|In {{defining}} specific TLU {{tasks that}} a university entrance examination should {{target in the}} case of the study site, it would be of primary importance to represent the portions of <b>areas</b> A, <b>B,</b> and C in Fig. 1 attributable to the secondary school EFL curriculum. This is because, as noted in the introduction section, an entrance examination may be designed to play the dual functions of assessing achievement of secondary school EFL (<b>areas</b> A, <b>B,</b> and C) and basic language ability required for further studies at the university (<b>areas</b> <b>B</b> and C). Furthermore, the degree of coverage of <b>areas</b> <b>B,</b> and C in the university entrance exam should be determined in relation to the extent to which the university EFL instruction can bridge the gap between secondary school EFL and the English language demands in university content courses. In contrast, including D and E in the entrance examination would not be feasible because they require the use of English assuming disciplinary knowledge.|$|R

25|$|By July, the {{operation}} still showed little progress. Phase I of Operation Mongoose {{drew to a}} close. The Special Group provided plans on March 14, 1962 for {{the first phase of}} {{the operation}} until the end of July 1962. There were four main objectives for Phase 1, a. was to gather hard intelligence on the target <b>area,</b> <b>b.</b> undertake all other political, economic, and covert actions short of creating a revolt in Cuba or the need for U.S. armed intervention, c. be consistent with U.S. overt policy and be in the position to pull away with minimum loss of assets in U.S. prestige, d. Continue JCS planning and essential preliminary actions for a decisive U.S. capability for intervention. During Phase I the Punta del Este conference was a major U.S. political action to isolate Castro and neutralize his influence in the Hemisphere. President Kennedy's successful visit to Mexico was another major U.S. political action with an impact upon the operation but was not directly tied to the operation. Two political operations were performed in Phase I: counter Castro-Communist propaganda exploitation of May Day and to arouse strong Hemisphere reaction to Cuban military suppression of the hunger demonstration at Cardenas in June. Another key interest for Operation Mongoose was the Cuban refugees as it was thought they wanted to overthrow the Communist regime in Havana and recapturing their homeland. The refugees wee given open U.S. assistance to remain in this country yet are involved in covert actions in a limited way. Policy limitations of audibility and visibility were taken into consideration for the handling and use of the refugee potential. As Phase 1 drew to a close Phase II projected plan was written up and considered four possibilities. The first one was to cancel operational plans and treat Cuba as a Bloc nation and protect Hemisphere from it. The next possibility was to exert all possible diplomatic, economic, psychological, and other pressures to overthrow the Castro-Communist regime without overt employment of U.S. military. Another possibility was to help the Cubans overthrow the Castro-Communist regime with a step-by-step phase to ensure success including the use of military force if required. The last possibility was to use a provacation and overthrow the Castro-Communist regime by U.S. military force. In his July review, Lansdale recommended a more aggressive plan of action in the near future. He believed that time was of the essence, especially with the intensified Soviet military build-up in Cuba at the time. New plans to recruit more Cubans to infiltrate the Castro regime, interrupt Cuban radio and television broadcasts, and the deployment of commando sabotage units were drawn up.|$|E
