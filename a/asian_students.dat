5|$|Wu {{heard that}} at Michigan {{women were not}} even allowed to use the front entrance, and decided that she would prefer to study at Berkeley. Yuan took her to see Raymond T. Birge, {{the head of the}} physics department, and he offered Wu a place in the {{graduate}} school {{despite the fact that the}} academic year had already commenced. Wu then abandoned her plans to study at Michigan and enrolled at Berkeley. Her Berkeley classmates included Robert R. Wilson and George Volkoff; her friends included Ursula Schaefer, a history student who chose to remain in the United States rather than return to Nazi Germany, and Margaret Lewis, an American post-doctoral student. Wu applied for a scholarship at the end of her first year, but there was prejudice against <b>Asian</b> <b>students,</b> and Wu and Yuan were instead offered a readership with a lower stipend. Yuan then applied for, and secured, a scholarship at Caltech.|$|E
5|$|Diệm spent {{little time}} on {{detailed}} defence and policy discussions with Australian officials during the trip, {{because of his}} extensive meetings with Catholic leaders. Although Diệm had signalled his intentions to discuss defence relations during the visit, these did not materialise. At {{the end of the}} visit, Diệm and Menzies released a bilateral statement, announcing that they would increase the magnitude of the Colombo Plan, a program under which <b>Asian</b> <b>students</b> could study abroad in Western nations. However, there was little detail in the announcements relating to anti-communism, with only general expressions of Australian support. Diệm had previously stated that if North Vietnam attacked the south, he would send the Army of the Republic of Vietnam to land in the Red River Delta in the north and retaliate. This was contrary to the air attack plans of the South East Asian Treaty Organization (SEATO), which had vowed to defend the south under the provisions of the Manila Treaty. Despite the public statements of support, the Australian government never shared the details of the SEATO plans with Diệm.|$|E

5|$|Bahrain also {{encourages}} {{institutions of higher}} learning, drawing on expatriate talent and the increasing pool of Bahrain nationals returning from abroad with advanced degrees. The University of Bahrain was established for standard undergraduate and graduate study, and the King Abdulaziz University College of Health Sciences, operating {{under the direction of}} the Ministry of Health, trains physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and paramedics. The 2001 National Action Charter paved the way for the formation of private universities such as the Ahlia University in Manama and University College of Bahrain in Saar. The Royal University for Women (RUW), established in 2005, was the first private, purpose-built, international University in Bahrain dedicated solely to educating women. The University of London External has appointed MCG (Management Consultancy Group) as the regional representative office in Bahrain for distance learning programmes. MCG is one of the oldest private institutes in the country. Institutes have also opened which educate South <b>Asian</b> <b>students,</b> such as the Pakistan Urdu School, Bahrain and the Indian School, Bahrain. A few prominent institutions are DePaul University, Bentley University, the Ernst & Young Training Institute, NYIT and the Birla Institute of Technology International Centre. In 2004, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) set up a constituent medical university in the country. In addition to the Arabian Gulf University, AMA International University and the College of Health Sciences, these are the only medical schools in Bahrain.|$|E

25|$|Magdalene College {{continued}} to be a liberal college through the Victorian era. The college had more liberal admissions policies than most, admitting Arthur Cohen, the first practising Jew to graduate from Cambridge. During the same period, Magdalene also admitted Catholic students such as Charles Januarius Acton, and <b>Asian</b> <b>students</b> who were excluded from many other colleges until after the First World War.|$|E
25|$|After World War II, {{and during}} the 1950s, the College again trained {{returned}} service men and women for post-war life, which prompted the development of courses in food technology, transport studies, accountancy and advertising, and the revision of its art syllabuses.

25|$|A {{secondary}} {{analysis of}} a series of surveys conducted for the AAUW and administered to a representative sample of 2,064 8th through 11th-grade American students in 2000 showed that 9.6% of the students reported educator sex abuse. The students were asked if and how often they had experienced 14 types of behaviors which constitute sexual harassment. They then indicated who harassed them (students, teachers, school employees). Nonphysical sexual abuse (e.g., making sexual jokes) was more prevalent than physical abuse (8.7 and 6.7%). Girls {{were more likely to report}} educator sexual harassment than boys (10.3 and 8.8%). 12.3% of black, 12.2% of Latino, 8.4% of white and 1,8 % of <b>Asian</b> <b>students</b> indicated that they had experienced sexual harassment by teachers.|$|E
25|$|The fashion {{industry}} {{is known for}} not being inclusive of more races in their runways and ad campaigns, and several {{studies that have been}} conducted prove that the lack of racial diversity can contribute to body image issues amongst non-white minorities. In one such experiment, conducted in 2003, 3 photographs of attractive white, black and Asian women were shown to a group of white, black and <b>Asian</b> <b>students.</b> The study concluded that Asian women thought that the photograph of the white woman was the most attractive, and reported high levels of body dissatisfaction. Such dissatisfaction may even cause these individuals to suffer psychologically due to the pressure to embody these ideals, and may result in them going through several means to change their physical appearance in order to match the Eurocentric idea of beauty.|$|E
25|$|City College began {{charging}} tuition in 1976. But {{after three}} decades, by 1999, the CUNY Board of Trustees voted to eliminate remedial classes at all CUNYs senior colleges, thereby eliminating a central {{pillar of the}} policy of Open Admissions and effectively ending it. Students who could not meet the academic entrance requirements for CUNY's senior colleges were forced to enroll in the system's community colleges, where they could prepare for an eventual transfer {{to one of the}} 4-year institutions. Since this decision, all CUNY senior colleges, especially CCNY, have begun to rise in prestige nationally, as evinced by school rankings and incoming freshman GPA and SAT scores. In addition, the end of open admissions sparked a change in CUNY's student demographics, with the number of Black and Hispanic students decreasing and the number of White Caucasian and <b>Asian</b> <b>students</b> increasing.|$|E

40|$|Backlash effects (Rudman, 1998) {{refer to}} the social and {{economic}} sabotage inflicted on those who display traits and behaviours that deviate from their group stereotypes in an effort to mitigate the threat to established social hierarchies. However, whether the presence of visual cues such as photographs of the stereotype violators accentuate or attenuate the backlash effects is currently unknown. Using a vignette experimental design, the present study investigated whether Australian students prefer and have higher intention to interact with an <b>Asian</b> international <b>student</b> described as displaying either stereotypical or counter-stereotypical traits and behaviours. Half of the vignettes (stereotypical and counter-stereotypical) were presented to the participants with a photograph of an <b>Asian</b> international <b>student</b> and the other half had no photo. Additionally, participant’s multicultural personalities (social initiative, emotional stability, open-mindedness, flexibility, and cultural empathy) and past contact experiences with <b>Asian</b> international <b>students</b> were investigated as potential moderators of the relationships between stereotypicality of the target in the vignette and participant’s perceived liking for, and intention to interact with the <b>Asian</b> international <b>student.</b> Results indicated that participants liked the fictitious counter-stereotypical <b>Asian</b> international <b>student</b> less in the vignettes and this effect was not moderated by the presence of the photograph. In contrast, participants expressed lower interest to interact with the counter-stereotypical <b>Asian</b> international <b>student</b> only when the photograph of the <b>Asian</b> international <b>student</b> was absent. Furthermore, participants with more cultural empathy and open-mindedness generally expressed greater liking and intention to interact with the <b>Asian</b> international <b>students</b> in the vignettes. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed...|$|R
