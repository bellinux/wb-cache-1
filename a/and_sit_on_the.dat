25|$|The {{issue was}} {{brought before the}} Liberal party room on 7 August 2017, when Parliament resumed sitting {{following}} the winter break. Up to five Liberal MPs in the lower house and one Senator stated they would consider crossing the floor to bring on debate on a same-sex marriage bill, even if the party rejects a free vote and maintains its plebiscite policy. The legislation, drafted by Senator Smith, was revealed the day prior to the party room meeting. In response to {{the prospect of the}} Liberal Party potentially moving to a free vote, Nationals MP Andrew Broad stated he would quit the Coalition <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> crossbench, saying the likely outcome of such a decision would be the fall of the Turnbull Government.|$|E

[...] He planned to teach full-time at the Silverlake Conservatory of Music, but ultimately decided to remain within the band. Flea later stated that [...] "the most painful part of quitting, and the thing that stopped me, was the idea of telling Anthony." ...|$|E

500|$|Greece Athena High School {{basketball}} coach Jim Johnson decided to add McElwain to the roster for the team's February 15 game against Spencerport High School, so McElwain {{could be given}} a jersey <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bench for the team's last home game of the season, and allow McElwain to play a few minutes if Greece Athena got a comfortable lead. With four {{minutes left in the}} game, Greece Athena had a double-digit lead, so Johnson decided to let McElwain play out the last minutes of the game. When teammates first passed the ball to McElwain he attempted a three-point shot and missed. McElwain got a second chance to score with a lay-up which he also missed. McElwain then got [...] "hot as a pistol", sinking six three-pointers and one two-point shot, before the game ended. The final score was Greece Athena 79, Spencerport 43. As soon as the final buzzer rang, fans from the stands stormed the court in celebration.|$|E
500|$|MGM {{executives}} screened Greed at {{full length}} once to meet contractual obligations. Idwal Jones, a San Francisco critic, attended the all-day screening and wrote {{that while some}} of the scenes were compelling, Stroheim's desire that [...] "every comma of the book [...] put in" [...] was ultimately negative. MGM then took control and re-edited it. The studio ordered June Mathis to cut it down further; she assigned the job to an editor named Joseph W. Farnham. Farnham was a well-known [...] "titles editor", who patched scenes together using title cards to keep continuity. His contributions to Greed include the notorious title cards [...] "Such was McTeague" [...] and [...] "Let's go over <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sewer", which were snickered at for years. Eventually Farnham reduced Greed to 10 reels, totaling [...] Von Stroheim said that the film [...] "was cut by a hack with nothing on his mind but his hat." [...] He later bitterly lamented that Greed was made before the financial success of Eugene O'Neill's four-hour play Strange Interlude in 1928. Von Stroheim angrily disowned the final version, blaming Mathis for destroying his masterpiece.|$|E
500|$|When {{it became}} clear Taft would be renominated, Roosevelt and his {{supporters}} bolted the party; the former president asked Borah to chair the organizational meeting of his new Progressive Party, but the Idahoan refused. Borah would not countenance leaving the Republican Party and did not support any of the presidential candidates (the Democrats nominated New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson). [...] When Roosevelt came to Boise on a campaign swing in October, Borah {{felt he had to}} greet the former president <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> platform as Roosevelt spoke, though he was unwilling to endorse him. [...] Roosevelt told in his speech of a long list of state delegate votes he said had been stolen from him, and after each, turned to Borah and asked, [...] "Isn't that so, Senator Borah?" [...] giving him no choice but to nod. [...] It is not clear whether Borah voted for Roosevelt or Taft, he later stated both at different times. The main issue in Idaho was Borah's re-election, which was so popular that those disgruntled at the senator for not supporting Taft or Roosevelt kept quiet. Idahoans helped elect Wilson, but sent 80 Republican legislators out of 86 to Boise (with two of the six Democrats pledged to support Borah if necessary), who on January 14, 1913 returned William Borah for a second term.|$|E

2500|$|State-{{integrate}}d {{schools are}} former private schools which {{have chosen to}} integrate into the state education system, becoming state schools but retaining their special character. They were established in 1975 after the near-collapse of the then private Catholic school system, which had run into financial difficulties and threatened to overwhelm the state school system were they to close. The majority of state-integrated schools are Catholic, but other Christian denominations, religions and educational philosophies are also represented. The private school owners stay on as proprietors, <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> school's board of trustees to ensure the special character is maintained. State-integrated schools charge [...] "attendance dues" [...] to parents {{to cover the costs}} of the still privately owned land and buildings, and to pay off any debts accrued by the school prior to integration. Typical attendance dues range between $240 and $740 per year for Catholic schools, and between $1,150 and $2,300 per year for non-Catholic state-integrated schools.|$|E
2500|$|Petrelis {{returned}} to New York City a year later, {{where he was}} one of 111 protesters arrested in a demonstration at St. Patrick's Cathedral on December 11, 1989. The demonstration was among ACT Up's most controversial, but Petrelis almost didn't participate; none of the other activists wanted to include him in their affinity groups for that demonstration because, he recalled, [...] "People felt I was too angry." [...] Petrelis said he nonetheless felt driven to go and changed his mind. Arriving early before the police had established barricades, Petrelis was able to enter the church, <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> aisle {{in the middle of the}} cathedral. As other protesters stage silent die-ins, or calmly read prepared statements, Petrelis stood on the pew and screamed, [...] "O'Connor, you're killing us! You're killing us, just stop it! Just stop it!" [...] Before officers removed him from the cathedral, Petrelis screamed, [...] "We will not be silent. We will fight O'Connor's bigotry." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{pre-season}} {{prior to}} the 1949 NFL season, the Lions played an exhibition game against the Philadelphia Eagles in New Orleans. [...] Coach McMillin met with the Lions' three African-American players (Mann, Groomes and Wally Triplett) before the trip. [...] He explained that {{there had never been}} an interracial game in New Orleans. [...] McMillan said he did not think he should break the prohibition and that the three of them would also not be permitted to stay with the team at the hotel. [...] McMillan offered to let the three attend the game <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bench, but Mann declined. [...] Interviewed in 2005, he recalled the incident:"I said if I can't play in the game I don't want to sit on the bench. ... Bo could've ended all that. He was supposed to be Mr. Great Liberal. But he didn't do it. He just passed it by. He could've been a big guy, a big fellow, but he didn't do it. I've never forgotten that. Don't tell me how liberal Bo was; he wasn't. He had a chance to be a hero, step up to the plate, but he didn't do it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Fremen have {{secretly}} mastered {{a way to}} ride sandworms {{across the}} desert. [...] First, a worm is lured by the vibrations of a thumper device. [...] When it surfaces, the lead worm-rider runs alongside it and snares one of its ring-segments with a special [...] "maker hook". [...] The hook is used to pry open the segment, exposing the soft inner tissue to the abrasive sand. [...] To avoid irritation, the worm will rotate its body so that the exposed flesh faces upwards, carrying the rider with it. [...] Other Fremen may then plant additional hooks for steering, or act as [...] "beaters", hitting the worm's tail to make it increase speed. A worm can be ridden for several hundred miles and for about half of a day, at which point it will become exhausted <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> open desert until the hooks are released, whereupon it will burrow back down to rest. The worm-riding ritual {{is used as a}} coming-of-age ritual among the Fremen. Worm-riding is used by Paul-Muad'Dib during the Battle of Arrakeen for troop transport into the city after using atomic weapons to blow a hole in the Shield Wall.|$|E
