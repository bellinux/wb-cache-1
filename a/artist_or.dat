5|$|Lions Entertainment {{is a new}} {{event at}} Cannes Lions where brands, {{agencies}} and entertainment companies can focus on producing outstanding creative work together. The Entertainment Lions for Music celebrate creative musical collaborations. Entries will need to demonstrate original production, promotion or distribution of music for brands; that is work where a recording <b>artist</b> <b>or</b> platform is innovatively leveraged to communicate with consumers. Adele has won once.|$|E
5|$|Hard Truths: The Art of Thornton Dial, {{on display}} from February to September 2011, {{includes}} over 70 large-scale artworks {{and is the}} largest assemblage of Thornton Dial's work ever mounted. The exhibition contextualizes Dial as a relevant, contemporary artist rather than a folk <b>artist</b> <b>or</b> outsider artist as many have portrayed him in the past. The pieces on view in Hard Truths cover a range {{of social and political}} themes, many of which address rural life in the south and the treatment of African Americans. After departing Indianapolis, the exhibition is scheduled to travel to New Orleans, Charlotte, North Carolina and Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, 13 acts {{achieved}} {{their first}} U.S. number-one single, {{either as a}} lead <b>artist</b> <b>or</b> featured guest, including Fantasia Barrino, Ciara, Jamie Foxx, Lil Jon, Petey Pablo, Pharrell, Twista and Kanye West. Barrino and Ciara were the only acts to have earned a number-one debut single this year. R singer Usher had four number-one singles {{that appeared in the}} 2004 issues, and Outkast had two. During the year, seven collaboration singles reached the number-one position, tying the record set in 2003.|$|E

5|$|The {{avenues for}} {{research}} {{have been limited}} by many historical factors. Many archives were destroyed in bombing campaigns in the two world wars, and {{a great number of}} works for which records do exist are themselves lost or destroyed. The record-keeping in the region was inconsistent, and often the export of works by major artists was, owing to the pressures of commercial demand, not adequately recorded. The practice of signing and dating works was rare until the 1420s, and while the inventories of collectors may have elaborately described the works, they attached little importance to recording the <b>artist</b> <b>or</b> workshop that produced them. Surviving documentation tends to come from inventories, wills, payment accounts, employment contracts and guild records and regulations.|$|E
5|$|Any album {{released}} by a British <b>artist,</b> <b>or</b> by a band where over 50% {{of the members}} are British, may be submitted for consideration by their record label. The shortlist is chosen by an independent panel of musicians, music presenters, music producers, music journalists, festival organisers and other figures {{in the music industry}} in the UK and Ireland. The prize is open to all types of music, including pop, rock, folk, urban, grime, dance, jazz, blues, electronica and classical. Presentation of the awards usually takes place at an Awards Show in October, after the shortlist is announced at the Album of the Year Launch in September. It is often observed that bands whose albums are shortlisted, or win the prize, experience a large increase in album sales, particularly for lesser known acts. Each shortlisted artist receives a specially commissioned 'Albums of the Year' trophy at the Awards Show. Unlike some other music awards, the overall winner of the Mercury Prize also receives a cheque; in 2017, the prize money was £25,000. The winner also receives an additional winner's trophy.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of his debut album Brown Sugar (1995), D'Angelo went into a four and a half year absence from the music scene and {{releasing}} solo work. His debut album presented a musical fusion of traditional soul and R influences with hip hop vocal and production elements, serving as fundamental elements for the neo soul sound. With its single-oriented success, Brown Sugar earned considerable sales success and defied the contemporary, producer-driven sound of the time, while earning popularity among mature R audiences and the growing hip hop generation. Prior to its release, neo soul itself was undefined by a major <b>artist</b> <b>or</b> musical work, and was developing during the early 1990s through the work of artists such as Tony! Toni! Toné!, Me'Shell NdegéOcello, and Omar. The album also earned D'Angelo recognition for producing a commercial breakthrough for the genre and giving notice to other neo soul artists, including Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Maxwell.|$|E

5|$|The iPhone 4S {{can play}} music, movies, {{television}} shows, ebooks, audiobooks, and podcasts and can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists, genres, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and compilations. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from iTunes. The iPhone 4S uses a large font that allows users {{plenty of room}} to touch their selection. Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the 4S, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific <b>artist,</b> <b>or</b> create a Genius playlist.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{significant}} difference in painting trends between the Northern Song period (960–1127) and Southern Song period (1127–1279). The paintings of Northern Song officials were influenced by their political ideals of bringing order to the world and tackling the largest issues affecting the whole of their society, hence their paintings often depicted huge, sweeping landscapes. On the other hand, Southern Song officials were more interested in reforming society from the bottom up and on a much smaller scale, a method they believed had a better chance for eventual success. Hence, their paintings often focused on smaller, visually closer, and more intimate scenes, while the background was often depicted as bereft of detail as a realm without substance or concern for the <b>artist</b> <b>or</b> viewer. This change in attitude from one era to the next stemmed largely from the rising influence of Neo-Confucian philosophy. Adherents to Neo-Confucianism focused on reforming society from the bottom up, not the top down, which can be seen in their efforts to promote small private academies during the Southern Song instead of the large state-controlled academies seen in the Northern Song era.|$|E

25|$|While posing, a {{model is}} {{expected}} to remain essentially motionless, and usually remains silent. Exact requirements may vary depending upon the <b>artist</b> <b>or</b> instructor, but an experienced model will not speak, wriggle, scratch, or readjust during the pose.

These breaks—during which the model usually wears a robe or puts on clothing—allow the model to stretch, relax and attend to other needs.|$|E
