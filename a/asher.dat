5|$|Sol is Asher's younger brother, and <b>Asher</b> has {{provided}} for him {{most of his}} life. <b>Asher</b> has been a father figure to Sol since a young age, and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on <b>Asher,</b> however. Sol is loyal to his brother, but depends on him {{so much that he}} finds it difficult to function without him. Sol likes his family to be together, but they are fractured due to <b>Asher</b> being a troublemaker and their mother being mentally unstable and Sol wants to reunite them. Sol's dependence on <b>Asher</b> also means he finds it difficult to establish his own identity. <b>Asher</b> is willing to put himself out to secure Sol's success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch so Sol can get a place in the dance group, and has done things so that Sol would not have to do them himself. Thompson opined that <b>Asher</b> is not necessarily the best role model for Sol, but is a good brother even though the mistakes he makes override the good things he has done for Sol. Cole said that Sol is not a troublemaker but he gets into trouble without meaning to as trouble comes to him. Although he does not bring attention to himself, he has a bad temper and hides his feelings with violence. He gets into a few fights throughout the series, and makes situations worse by getting physical. Sol does not understand or think about what he is doing when he loses his temper. Cole also said that trust is an issue with Sol throughout the series.|$|E
5|$|Temperatures Rising {{was one of}} two sitcoms {{that the}} ABC network premiered in its 1972–73 prime time schedule, the other being The Paul Lynde Show.

Ackerman served as executive producer and <b>Asher</b> as producer.|$|E

5|$|<b>Asher</b> {{broke off}} the {{engagement}} in early 1968, after {{coming back from}} an acting assignment in Bristol to find McCartney in bed with another woman, Francie Schwartz. McCartney and <b>Asher</b> later attempted to mend their relationship, but finally broke up in July1968. <b>Asher</b> has consistently refused to publicly discuss {{that part of her}} life. Schwartz, a twenty three year old New York scriptwriter, had travelled to London trying to interest Apple Corps in a film script. Schwartz was then asked by McCartney to move into his Cavendish Avenue house, and was given a job working for Derek Taylor at Apple, which was then based in Wigmore Street, London.
