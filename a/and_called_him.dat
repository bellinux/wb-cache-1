5|$|Gandhi {{focused his}} {{attention}} on Indians while in South Africa. He {{was not interested in}} politics. This changed after he was discriminated against and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach because of his skin colour by a white train official. After several such incidents with Whites in South Africa, Gandhi's thinking and focus changed, he felt he must resist this and fight for rights. He entered politics by forming Natal Indian Congress. According to Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, Gandhi's views on racism are contentious, in some cases distressing to those who admire him. Gandhi suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied him his rights, the press and those in the streets bullied <b>and</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> a parasite, semi-barbarous, canker, squalid coolie, yellow man, and other epithets. People would spit on him as an expression of racial hate.|$|E

25|$|According to the Book of Joshua, Abraham {{came from}} a land and a family that worshiped strange gods. However, when their God {{revealed}} himself to Abraham <b>and</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> to leave his native land for Canaan, he did so.

25|$|David Plowright, who {{had worked}} at Granada since 1957, {{resigned}} in 1992 citing the arrival of Gerry Robinson. He tightened the departmental budget with an uncompromising business approach. Plowright had been the company's driving force, producing programmes such as World in Action, and Coronation Street, and promoting the Granada Studios Tour. His departure angered well-known media-industry figures; John Cleese faxed Robinson using 'vitriolic language' <b>and</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> an 'upstart caterer', a reference to his past employment. John Birt, Harold Pinter and Alan Bennett all supported Plowright for his quality programming.|$|E

25|$|According to some scholars, in the mid-460s, Eastern Roman Emperor Leo I {{wanted to}} balance {{the weight of the}} Germanic {{component}} of the army, whose leader was the Alan magister militum Aspar. He thought that Tarasis and his Isaurians could be that counterweight, <b>and</b> <b>called</b> <b>him,</b> with many Isaurians, to Constantinople. This interpretation, however, has been contested. By mid-460s, Arcadia and Zeno had been living at Constantinople for some time, where also Lallis and Longinus lived, the latter married to a Valeria, possibly a woman of aristocrat rank.|$|E
25|$|He toured Pakistan in 1977–78, {{playing in}} {{all three of the}} Tests, at Lahore, Hyderabad, and Karachi, and two of the One Day Internationals, at Sialkot and Lahore, missing the first ODI at Sahiwal. He almost took a hat-trick on his Test debut: he {{dismissed}} Abdul Qadir leg before wicket, then bowled Sarfraz Nawaz first ball. The next batsman, Iqbal Qasim, was caught at slip by Mike Brearley. Despite the umpire giving him out, Brearley was not sure whether he had taken the catch cleanly <b>and</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> back to the crease.|$|E
25|$|By 1995, Illingworth {{had been}} out of the England side for two years, but the {{selectors}} were impressed by his reliable performances for his county, <b>and</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> up for the Test series against West Indies. He played in all but the Fourth Test (for which he was replaced by John Emburey), and although his series figures of 6–215 were not particularly outstanding, he was selected for the winter tour to South Africa. It proved a good choice: Illingworth had his best series for England, taking nine Test wickets at an average of under 21. He also appeared four times in the 1996 World Cup, but thereafter the selectors' preference turned decisively to Tufnell, and Illingworth never played international cricket again.|$|E

The Master of Pain easily dominated Lawler until Mantel entered the ring <b>and</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> off. Lawler agreed to a title match, which was held on April 1, when The Master of Pain won his first professional wrestling championship. He held it for just over three weeks before Lawler became the first man to pin him, winning it back.|$|E
25|$|When Emperor Wu {{wanted to}} {{reassign}} Jia Chong {{to guard the}} Guanzhong region, Xun Xu told his colleague Feng Dan (馮紞) that their status in the imperial court depended on Jia Chong's presence so they should {{try to stop the}} emperor from sending Jia Chong out of the imperial capital, Luoyang. Xun Xu thought of persuading Emperor Wu to arrange a marriage between Sima Zhong, the crown prince, and Jia Chong's daughter, Jia Nanfeng. In this way, Jia Chong, as the crown prince's father-in-law, would have to remain in Luoyang. Xun Xu and Feng Dan then sang praises of Jia Chong's daughter in front of Emperor Wu and managed to convince him to arrange the marriage. Many officials were disgusted by Xun Xu's fawning behaviour <b>and</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> a sycophant.|$|E
25|$|In the Jagannath tradition, {{he has the}} {{attributes}} of all the avatars of Vishnu. This belief is celebrated by dressing him and worshipping him as different avatars on special occasions. However he is most frequently identified with Krishna, the eighth avatar of Vishnu. The Puranas relate that the Narasimha Avatar of Vishnu appeared from a wooden pillar. It is therefore believed that Jagannath is worshipped as a wooden murti or Daru Brahma with the Sri Narasimha hymn dedicated to the Narasimha Avatar. Every year {{in the month of}} Bhadra, Jagannath is dressed and decorated {{in the form of the}} Vamana avatar of Vishnu. Jagannath appeared in the form of Rama, another avatar of Vishnu, to Tulsidas, who worshipped him as Rama <b>and</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> Raghunath during his visit to Puri in the 16th-century.|$|E
