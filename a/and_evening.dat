5|$|The {{station was}} the busiest {{stop on the}} Westside line by 1999 {{with an average of}} 3,005 daily boardings. In March 2008, TriMet added {{additional}} capacity during the morning <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> commuting period. This was accomplished by extending three Red Line trains from the Beaverton Transit Center stop each morning <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> during peak ridership times.|$|E
5|$|Chatteris has morning <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> Women's Institutes, {{which both}} {{meet at the}} King Edward Centre, and a Rotary Club which meet at the local fire station, and put on an annual {{firework}} display, plus other events in the town.|$|E
50|$|A {{specific}} way {{of obtaining}} replicates is to average all the odd <b>and</b> <b>even</b> trials in separate buffers. This {{has the advantage}} of allowing for comparison of <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd results from interleaved trials. An average of odd <b>and</b> <b>even</b> averages generates the completed averaged result, while the difference between the odd <b>and</b> <b>even</b> averages constitutes an estimate of the noise.|$|R
5000|$|But {{despite their}} meager aims, {{harassment}} and abuses continued. Local police, military police, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> [...] "civilian guards" [...] intimidated, arrested, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> killed Huk veterans and PKM supporters.|$|R
25|$|Local {{officials}} are chosen by election, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> though non-Communist Party candidates {{are allowed to}} stand, those with dissident views can face arbitrary exclusion from the ballot, interference with campaigning, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> detention.|$|R
5|$|For free {{entertainment}} one can stroll along Strøget, especially between Nytorv and Højbro Plads, {{which in}} the late afternoon <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> is a bit like an impromptu three-ring circus with musicians, magicians, jugglers and other street performers.|$|E
5|$|Morning and Night {{are now in}} the National Trust Bearsted Collection at Upton House, Warwickshire. The {{collection}} was assembled by Walter Samuel, 2nd Viscount Bearsted and gifted to the Trust, along with the house, in 1948. Noon <b>and</b> <b>Evening</b> remain in the Ancaster Collection at Grimsthorpe Castle, Lincolnshire.|$|E
5|$|Most weekday SLE trains run local {{westbound}} from New London or Old Saybrook to New Haven in the morning, {{with some}} nonstop eastbound service. This traffic pattern is reversed {{in the afternoon}} <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> rush. A handful operate through New Haven as far as Stamford.|$|E
25|$|In some camps, two, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> {{three sets}} of people, occupy one tent <b>and</b> 10, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> 12, persons are {{frequently}} herded together in tents of which the cubic capacity is about 500 c.f.|$|R
50|$|Odd <b>and</b> <b>Even</b> is a {{solitaire}} {{card game}} which is played with two decks of playing cards. It is so called because {{the building is}} done in twos, resulting in odd <b>and</b> <b>even</b> numbers.|$|R
50|$|Participants {{are unaware}} that 2 of the decks {{correspond}} to net winnings - low payoffs <b>and</b> <b>even</b> lower losses. The other 2 decks correspond to net losses - high payoffs <b>and</b> <b>even</b> higher losses.|$|R
5|$|Afternoon is {{the time}} {{occurring}} between noon <b>and</b> <b>evening.</b> The specific range of time this encompasses varies in one direction: noon is currently defined as a constant 12:00 pm, but when afternoon ends is dependent on when evening begins, {{for which there is}} no standard definition. However, before a period of transition from the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, noon instead referred to 3 pm—possible explanations include shifting times for prayers and midday meals, along which one concept of noon was defined—and so afternoon would have referred to a narrower timeframe.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{that are}} most active at dawn and dusk, when {{temperatures}} are cooler than mid-day, are called crepuscular. The subdued morning <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> light helps make them less visible to predators, but is bright enough {{to allow them to}} locate food. Some animals are crepuscular mainly because their prey is. Crepuscular animals in the area include mule deer, coyotes, porcupines, mountain cottontails, jackrabbits, and many songbirds.|$|E
5|$|Birchington-on-Sea {{railway station}} {{is on the}} Chatham Main Line which runs between Ramsgate in East Kent and London Victoria. Other {{stations}} on this line include Broadstairs, Margate, Herne Bay, Faversham, Gillingham, Chatham, Rochester and Bromley South. Birchington is around 1hour and 40minutes from London by Mainline train. A National Express coach service also runs between London Victoria and Ramsgate via Birchington-on-Sea. A selection of early morning <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> trains run on weekdays to London's Cannon Street station and high speed services to St. Pancras International, primarily for business commuting.|$|E

50|$|The more rattled Evan gets, {{the more}} distracted he becomes at work. <b>And</b> <b>even</b> when the cousins {{come to a}} {{tentative}} truce, everything backfires on them in events that involve girlfriends, relatives <b>and</b> <b>even</b> the homeless.|$|R
5|$|Common elands are nomadic and crepuscular. They eat in {{the morning}} <b>and</b> <b>evening,</b> rest in shade when hot and remain in {{sunlight}} when cold. They are commonly found in herds of up to 500, with individual members remaining in the herd anywhere from several hours to several months. Juveniles and mothers tend to form larger herds, while males may separate into smaller groups or wander individually. During estrus, mainly in the rainy season, groups tend to form more regularly. In southern Africa common elands will often associate with herds of zebras, roan antelopes and oryxes.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his Magdalen Scholarship he had a scholarship from Hampshire County Council worth £50 a year. After arriving he made a favourable impression on Sir Herbert Warren, the President of Magdalen College, who upgraded the exhibition to a Demyship of £80 a year and arranged for the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths to give Denning a £30 a year scholarship. Despite military training {{in the early morning}} <b>and</b> <b>evening,</b> Denning worked hard at his studies, and obtained a First in Mathematical Moderations, the first half of his mathematics degree, in June 1917.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the {{congregation}} {{could still be}} assured of the required quorum of ten men for the minyan during the week, as local businessmen attended the morning <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> prayers before opening and after closing their shops. By 1996, however, the membership was down to around two dozen, and Spiegel began holding services in the small social hall in the basement, as the main sanctuary had become too expensive to maintain.|$|E

In particular students can study at Highlands for the two-year foundation degree in financial services and for a BSc in social sciences, both validated by the University of Plymouth.|$|E
5|$|On 21 March 1993, the Joondalup railway line {{came into}} {{operation}} {{as part of}} the Northern Suburbs Transit System, resulting {{in the creation of the}} 449 and 457 services to replace the 387 service. The 449 operated only during the morning <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> rush-hour, while the 457 operated after-hours and at weekends. These services operated virtually unchanged until 6 November 2011, when the 347 was replaced with the present-day 387, and the 457 and weekday evening services were withdrawn. On 31 January 2016, the 449 was also withdrawn, leaving Hamersley without weekend bus services.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few years at Victoria College, Smuts's {{religion}} continued to be of crucial importance. On Sundays he would attend both morning <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> church services, also leading a Bible study class for local Coloured boys, and during the week he was an assiduous attendee at evening prayer meetings. Within Victoria College, one of the strongest friendships he formed was with Professor JI Marais, the head of the Theology faculty.|$|E

5000|$|Two mosques, one Hanuman {{temple and}} a {{cemetery}} ‘Raju Dada’ are there. Poverty and pressure on land impelled few people towards the mid of 20th century to migrate to Lucknow, Kanpur, Unnao <b>and</b> <b>even</b> Bombay, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> foreign countries.|$|R
5|$|The {{city also}} {{strictly}} regulated non-motorized pedicabs; it first permitted the bicycle-powered taxis in 1984, {{but there were}} no active pedicab licenses in the city by 2008. Schiff proposed eliminating some restrictions, and the city council passed ordinances allowing pedicabs to operate on downtown streets, downtown bridges, and on the Nicollet Mall, at any time except the morning <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> rush hours. In October 2011, when the city permitted pedicabs to operate during rush hours (with new safety regulations), eight licensed pedicab companies operated forty cabs in the downtown area.|$|E
5|$|The {{collection}} {{consists of}} items created between 1900 and 1940 and includes day <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> dresses, coats, underwear and stockings, swimwear, shoes, hats and gloves, baby and children's clothes. In addition, the extended collection includes Tinne's jewellery, her servants' clothes {{and also some}} soft furnishings. To provide context, Tinne's collection of fashion magazines and sewing patterns are {{also included in the}} collection.|$|E
5|$|There is {{generally}} an hourly service to Sheringham (8minutes) and to Norwich (55minutes), with more frequent services {{during the morning}} <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> peak travel times. On Sundays, trains run every twohours to Sheringham and Norwich. In 1997 a single daily through train to and from London Liverpool Street to Sheringham via Cromer was introduced; it was not heavily used and the service was consequently discontinued. All of these services are run by diesel multiple units Class 153, 156 or occasionally 170.|$|E

They can appear inebriated <b>and</b> dizzy, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> die. This is serious because it has substantial economic consequences for agriculture.|$|R
50|$|There are {{numerous}} examples of where finances are not managed right and where companies, individuals <b>and</b> <b>even</b> countries are liquidated, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> more examples {{where there has}} been episodes of financial mismanagement but the situation was still able to be escaped.|$|R
