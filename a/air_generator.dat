A vortex <b>air</b> <b>generator</b> system was built, consisting of concentric cylinders. The inner cylinder was fitted with stationary air guide vanes and covered at the top by a transparent plate to capture the solar radiation and create swirling updraft flow which is able to rotate wind turbine and produces power. The influence of inlet air velocity and temperature on the swirling strength and mass flow generated has been evaluated by validated CFD simulation. ANSYS Fluent software was adopted to solve the 3 -D, steady state of Navier-Stokes and energy equations in cylindrical coordinate system integrated with discrete ordinates (DO) radiation model. For the preliminary vortex generator design, the CFD results were validated first with previous experimental measurements. Then the variable operation parameters were carried out on the proposed model. The simulation result demonstrated that inflow velocity is a key parameter for enhancing the system performance. By increasing the inflow velocity from 0. 4 m/s to 0. 6 m/s and inflow temperature 323 °k the enhancement rate of the mass air flow generated reached to 26 % compared with 7 % when increase the inflow temperature to 328 °k and inflow velocity 0. 4 m/s...|$|E

Furthermore, microalloyed elements in steel reduce the stability of wustite thereby facilitate the precipitation process, whose products of multi-phase oxide finally determine the adhesive strength of oxide scale and steel substrate. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} improve the {{separation}} efficiency in the air-solid phase, we proposed an innovative separation method called the active pulsing air classifier, which produce pulsing air by a pulsing <b>air</b> <b>generator.</b> In this way, the particles received a new acceleration action in each pulsing period, and then, it obtains a better performance than non-pulsing air separators in the laboratory scale. The dynamic equation of the motion particle in the active pulsing airflow was built up, showing that a higher density particle may get a small acceleration. The simulation results of airflow field show that the airflow turbulence acceleration will disperse the particles and a density dominant separation can be achieved. All high density particles, low density particles, and dust of waste catalyst can be acquired by the active pulsing air classifier. When the airflow velocity is 3. 33 m/s, the frequency of air pulsing is 7 / 3 Hz, the separation efficiency of the active pulsing air classifier reaches its maximum: 97. 63 %. Based on our study, an industry-scale pulsing air classifier is developed, which provides a new and efficient method for resource reutilization...|$|E
