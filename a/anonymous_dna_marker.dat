One of the patients was initially described as having a terminal deletion of chromosome 14 from 14 q 31 to 14 qter; we show here that this child has instead an interstitial deletion of band 14 q 31. The smallest deletion involves a single <b>anonymous</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>marker</b> and is associated with an almost normal phenotype. The two patients with larger deletions have phenotypes similar to those seen in previously described cases of interstitial deletions of chromosome 14, including minor dysmorphic features and developmental delay.

By comparing patterns of recombination in specific regions of chromosome 21 with regard to both parental sex and age, we have now identified a statistically significant downward trend {{in the frequency of}} crossovers in the most telomeric portion of chromosome 21 with increasing maternal age. A less significant decrease in recombination with increasing maternal age was observed in the pericentromeric region of the chromosome.

Surface individuals are eyed and pigmented; trog-lobitic forms are blind and depigmented. We hybridized surface fish and Pachon population cave fish and produced a RAPD genomic map 1064 cM in length (about half the total length of the genome) {{that was used to}} screen for quantitative trait loci (QTL) for troglomorphic traits. Three QTL for reduced eye size, two for de-creased numbers of melanophores, two for condition factor, and the locus for the unifactorial trait, albinism, were mapped. These factors account for an average of 46 % of the variance in these traits in the backcross. The results are the first direct demonstration that troglomorphic changes in this population are multifactorial. Two closely linked pairs of QTL were found. Each consisted of a regressive and a constructive trait QTL. These close linkages are unlikely to have occurred by chance (P. 05 for each) and suggest that troglomorphic evolution might be fa-cilitated by pleiotropy or by genetic hitchhiking...|$|R

To date, two SCA loci have been identified-one locus (SCA- 1) {{on the short}} arm of chromosome 6 and the second locus (SCA- 2) on the long arm of chromosome 12. We have studied two large kindreds from different ethnic backgrounds, segregating an {{autosomal dominant}} form of SCA. A total of 207 living individuals, including 50 affected, were examined, and blood was collected. We performed linkage analysis using <b>anonymous</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>markers</b> which flank the two previously described loci. Our results demonstrate that the two kindreds, one Austrian-Canadian and one French-Canadian, are linked to SCA- 2 (chromosome 12 q). Multipoint linkage analysis places the SCA- 2 locus within a region of approximately 16 cM between the microsatellites D 12 S 58 and D 12 S 84 /D 12 S 105 (odds ratio 2, 371 : 1 {{in favor of this}} position).

This report details our molecular studies of a woman with choroideremia and a de novo X; 13 translocation. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis using a contourclamped homogeneous electric field apparatus has allowed detection of the translocation breakpoint with the <b>anonymous</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>marker</b> p 1 bD 5 (DXS 165) and the mapping of this probe to within 120 kb of the breakpoint. In addition, we have used this probe to isolate a clone (pCH 4) from a 100 -kb jumping library which has crossed a rare-cutting restriction site (XhoI) between DXS 165 and the choroideremia gene and detects the translocation breakpoint using this enzyme. Although DXS 165 lies within 120 kb of the breakpoint and Cremers et al. (1987, Clin.

Apparently, most patients are sporadic cases. The genetic mechanism underlying familial AS has remained enigmatic for a long time. Recently, evidence has been emerging suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance of a detectable or undetectable defect in a gene or genes at 15 q 11 - 13, subject to genomic imprinting. The present report describes an unusually large pedigree with segregation of AS through maternal inheritance and apparent asymptomatic transmission through several male ancestors. Deletion and paternal disomy at 15 q 11 - 13 were excluded.

Two of the first 83 sequences characterized from the library were found to be deleted in probands from family XL- 45 as well as from family XL- 62.

Linkage to the UCLA-RP 09 disease gene was excluded for all eight candidate genes analyzed, including rhodopsin (RP 4) and peripherin/RDS (RP 7), for the four adRP loci RP 1, RP 9, RP 10 and RP 11, {{as well as for}} 17 phenotypic markers. The <b>anonymous</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>marker</b> locus D 17 S 938, linked to adRP locus RP 13 on chromosome 17 p 13. 1, yielded a suggestive but not statistically significant positive lod score.

A reanalysis of the original RP 13 data from a South African adRP family of British descent, in conjunction with our UCLA-RP 09 data, suggests that only one adRP locus exists on 17 p but that it maps to a more telomeric position, at band 17 p 13. 3, than previously reported. Confirmation of the involvement of RP 13 in two presumably unrelated adRP families, both of British descent, suggests that this locus is a distinct adRP gene in a proportion of British, and possibly other, adRP families...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of patients with DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) and velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS) and a minority of patients with non-syndromic conotruncal heart defects are hemizygous for a region of chromosome 22 q 11. The chromosomal region that is commonly deleted is larger than 2 Mb. It has not been possible to narrow the smallest region of overlap (SRO) of the deletions to less than ca 500 kb, which suggests that DGS/VCFS might be a contiguous gene syndrome. The saturation cloning of the SRO is being carried out, and one gene (TUPLE 1) has been identified. By using a cosmid probe (M 51) and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we show here that the <b>anonymous</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>marker</b> locus D 22 S 183 is within the SRO, between TUPLE 1 and D 22 S 75 (probe N 25). A second locus with weak homology to D 22 S 183, recognized by cosmid M 56, lies immediately outside the common SRO of the DGS and VCFS deletions, but inside the SRO of the DGS deletions. D 22 S 183 sequences are strongly conserved in primates and weaker hybridizing signals are found in DNA of other mammalian species; no transcripts are however detected in polyA+ RNA from various adult human organs. Probe M 51 allows fast reliable screening for 22 q 11 deletions using fluorescence in situ hybridization. A deletion was found in 11 out of 12 DGS patients and in 3 out of 7 VCFS patients.

Here we report two new polymorphic markers in the proximal portion of 4 p 16. 3, distal to D 4 S 10. Both loci, D 4 S 126 and D 4 S 127, are defined by cosmids isolated from a library enriched for sequences in the 4 pter- 4 p 15. 1 region. Physical mapping by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis places D 4 S 126 200 kb telomeric to D 4 S 10, while D 4 S 127 is located near the more distal marker D 4 S 95. Typing of a reference pedigree for D 4 S 126 and D 4 S 127 and for the recently described VNTR marker D 4 S 125 has firmly placed these loci on the existing linkage map of 4 p 16. 3. This genetic analysis has revealed that the region immediately distal to D 4 S 10 shows a dramatically higher rate of recombination than would be expected based on its physical size. D 4 S 10 -D 4 S 126 -D 4 S 125 span 3. 5 cM, but only 300 - 400 kb of DNA. Consequently, this small region accounts for most of the reported genetic distance between D 4 S 10 and HD.

40|$|Rare, large {{families}} with multiple cases of early-onset cancer affecting several generations provide {{clear evidence that}} inherited factors are important causes of cancer. 1 The range of cancers, the age at onset, {{and the number of}} generations affected all suggest familial risk. In this review, I discuss the five cancers in the United States that are associated with the highest number of deaths: lung, breast, colorectal, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. In the late 1980 s and early 1990 s, numerous cancer susceptibility genes were identified, including those for breast and colorectal cancer (Glossary and Table 1). These genes confer high relative risks of cancer among carriers (i. e., they are highly penetrant). Thus, they could be detected by linkage analysis, wherein DNA obtained from many members of a family in which there are cases of cancer is collect ed and analyzed with the use of hundreds of <b>anonymous,</b> highly polymor-phic <b>DNA</b> <b>markers</b> that are evenly spread across the genome. Family members are categorized in so-called liability classes, depending on their age {{and whether or not they}} have cancer, and a likelihood is assigned to putative gene carriers and noncar-riers. With this information, the disease phenotype can be linked to one particular allele of a polymorphic marker, and a logarithm-of-odds (lod) score can be calculate...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The recent {{discovery}} that the gene causing Huntington's disease (HD) resides on chromosome 4 has generated {{increased interest in}} this autosome. Chromosome 4 contains two of the more informative conventional genetic markers, GC and MNS, but most loci have been assigned to it by recombinant DNA techniques. There are currently more <b>anonymous</b> <b>DNA</b> fragments detecting restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) on chromosome 4 than on any other autosome. In addition, most of the cloned genes from this chromosome detect useful RFLPs. A genetic linkage map including both conventional and <b>DNA</b> <b>markers</b> should soon span the entire chromosome and will undoubtedly lead to the localisation of other inherited disorders. Chromosome 4 comprises 6 5 00 of human genomic DNA and therefore encodes perhaps 5000 to 10000 genes. As with all human chromosomes, {{only a very small}} minority of the genes on chromosome 4 have been identified. Taking together all genes, pseudo-genes, cell surface antigens, fragile sites, and anony-mous DNA segments given locus symbols, 69 loc...|$|R
40|$|Tomato is an {{important}} crop and regarded as an experimental model of the Solanaceae family and of fruiting plants in general. To enhance breeding efficiency and advance the field of genetics, tomato has been subject-ed to <b>DNA</b> <b>marker</b> studies {{as one of the}} earliest targets in plants. The developed <b>DNA</b> <b>markers</b> have been applied to the construction of genetic linkage maps and the resultant maps have contributed to quantitative trait locus (QTL) and gene mappings for agronomically important traits, as well as to comparative genomics of Solanaceae. The recently released whole genome sequences of tomato enable us to develop large numbers of <b>DNA</b> <b>markers</b> comparatively easily, and even promote new genotyping methods without <b>DNA</b> <b>markers.</b> In addition, databases for genomes, <b>DNA</b> <b>markers,</b> genetic linkage maps and other omics data, e. g., transcrip-tome, proteome, metabolome and phenome information, will provide useful information for molecular breeding in tomatoes. The use of <b>DNA</b> <b>marker</b> technologies in conjunction with new breeding techniques will promise to advance tomato breeding...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Genomic {{research}} of cultivated peanut has lagged behind other crop species {{because of the}} paucity of polymorphic <b>DNA</b> <b>markers</b> found in this crop. It is necessary to identify additional <b>DNA</b> <b>markers</b> for further genetic research in peanut. Results Microsatellite markers in cultivated peanut were developed using the SSR enrichment procedure. The {{results showed that the}} GA/CT repeat was the most frequently dispersed microsatellite in peanut. The primer pairs were designed for fifty-six different microsatellites, 19 of which showed a polymorphism among the genotypes studied. The average number of alleles per locus was 4. 25, and up to 14 alleles were found at one locus. This suggests that microsatellite <b>DNA</b> <b>markers</b> produce a higher level of DNA polymorphism than other <b>DNA</b> <b>markers</b> in cultivated peanut. Conclusions It is desirable to isolate and characterize more <b>DNA</b> <b>markers</b> in cultivated peanut for more productive genomic studies, such as genetic mapping, marker-assisted selection, and gene discovery. The development of microsatellite markers holds a promise for such studies. </p...|$|R
