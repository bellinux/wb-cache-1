It {{is located}} {{in the middle of the}} mouth of the gulf, about 13 km from the Kara Sea [...] This island was named after Baltic-German scholar Karl Ernst von Baer. Baer made {{important}} contributions to the research of <b>Arctic</b> <b>meteorology</b> between 1830 and 1840.|$|E

Before the Estonian {{conversion}} to the euro, the 2-kroon bank note bore his portrait. Baer Island in the Kara Sea was named after Karl Ernst von Baer for his important contributions to the research of <b>Arctic</b> <b>meteorology</b> between 1830 and 1840. A duck, Baer's pochard, was also named after him.|$|E
40|$|Norway and Russia {{are both}} {{northern}} states, who administer vast maritime zones and land territories in the Arctic. Because of this, in both states {{we find a}} distinct northern focus that has occupied a prominent place, not least inside the field of sciences {{over the last two}} centuries. During the last decades of the 19 th century there developed a handful of so to say specific arctic research disciplines, such as <b>Arctic</b> oceanographic studies, <b>meteorology,</b> auroral research, and also fishery related research. Throughout the different sub disciplines of arctic research, Norwegian and Russian scientists have held parallel research interests over the last two centuries. This hasled to a strongly felt need for exchange of data and knowledge across the border, and also a desire to conduct transnational studies. The article explores the border crossing Norwegian-Russian scientific networks in arctic research through the 19 th century...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of tropospheric ozone depletion event (ODE) studies have focussed on time-series measurements, with comparatively few {{studies of the}} vertical component. Those that exist have almost exclusively used free-flying balloon-borne ozonesondes and almost all have been conducted in the Arctic. Here we use measurements from two separate Antarctic field experiments to examine the vertical profile of ozone during Antarctic ODEs. We use tethersonde data to probe details in the lowest few hundred meters and find considerable structure in the profiles associated with complex atmospheric layering. The profiles were all measured at wind speeds less than 7 ms − 1, and on each occasion the lowest inversion height lay between 10 m and 40 m. We also use data from a free-flying ozonesonde study to select events where ozone depletion was recorded at altitudes > 1 km above ground level. Using ERA- 40 meteorological charts, we find that on every occasion the high altitude depletion was preceded by an atmospheric low pressure system. An examination of limited published ozonesonde data from other Antarctic stations shows {{this to be a}} consistent feature. Given the link between BrO and ODEs, we also examine ground-based and satellite BrO measurements and find a strong association between atmospheric low pressure systems and enhanced BrO that must arise in the troposphere. The results suggest that, in Antarctica, such depressions are responsible for driving high altitude ODEs and for generating the large-scale BrO clouds observed from satellites. In the <b>Arctic,</b> the prevailing <b>meteorology</b> differs from that in Antarctica, but, while a less common effect, major low pressure systems in the Arctic can also generate BrO clouds. Such depressions thus appear to be fundamental when considering the broader influence of ODEs, certainly in Antarctica, such as halogen export and the radiative influence of ozone-depleted air masses...|$|R
50|$|Following the Second World War, two active {{atmospheric}} {{research groups}} emerged at McGill. Dr J. Stewart Marshall and R.H. Douglas led a radar meteorology group (Stormy Weather Group) in the Physics Department, and Dr F. Kenneth Hare directed an <b>arctic</b> <b>meteorology</b> program in Geography. These two groups united in 1959 {{to form the}} Department of Meteorology. In 1986, McGill University formed the first Canadian group of research on climate with the National Research Council of Canada (CNRC). Four years later, the mandate was widened, and its staffing enlarged. It is now the Centre for Climate and Global Change Research (C2GCR). The department started the Centre for research in mesoscale meteorology, {{in collaboration with the}} Meteorological Service of Canada, and it operates J. S. Marshall Radar Observatory since 1968.|$|E
50|$|Ice Station Alpha was {{occupied}} from 1957 - late 1958. When {{it began to}} break up, crews established a new station the following spring. Known as Ice Station Charlie, it lasted ten months before meeting the same fate. In 1961, USAF ended its sponsor¬ship of ice station research, turning its remaining facilities on T-3 over to the Navy.In an approach typical of the Cold War, ice station research included both basic and applied science in a framework of partnership between military and contracted researchers. By sponsoring and supporting the stations, USAF contributed to basic geophysical research as it tested military applications for its own purposes. Contributions to basic geophysics included studies in oceanography, <b>arctic</b> <b>meteorology</b> and the upper atmosphere, ice movement, solar radiation, gravity and magnetism, and ice island features and origins. The Air Force also gained experience in developing the islands as forward military stations with weather stations, emergency landing facilities and listening posts.|$|E
40|$|In a {{sense this}} title {{contains}} a fallacy. Meteorology {{is the most}} global of all sciences in outlook, {{and it can be}} argued that there is no longer any such thing as <b>arctic</b> <b>meteorology,</b> at least in the free atmosphere. Fifteen years ago this was not so. We knew so little of the atmospheric circulation near the pole that it was legitimate to use the title, as I did when in 1954 I founded the <b>Arctic</b> <b>Meteorology</b> Research Group at McGill University (around a program of research transferred from the University of California at Los Angeles). The purpose of our research, and of a sister group at the University of Washington under R. J. Reed, was to bring an understanding of the role of the Arctic into the mainstream of meteorological knowledge. This has now been achieved, and the title is hence anachronistic. Although it is no longer valid to talk of a specifically <b>arctic</b> <b>meteorology,</b> it is still true that the Arctic plays a special role in the planetary climate, in at least three domains. At the ice/atmosphere interface over the Arctic Ocean and Greenland the very special energy rCgime is crucial to the present global climate. This rkgime has been the special interest of a group of meteorologists including F. I. Badgley, M. I. Budyko, Y. P. Doronin, J. 0. Fletcher, M. K. Gavrilova, M. S. Marshunova...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an introduction to}} the initial scientific results of the Airborne Arctic Stratospheric Expedition (AASE), as well as data from other atmospheric experiments and analyses carried out during the Arctic polar winter of 1989. Mission objectives of the AASE were to study the mechanisms of ozone depletion and redistribution in the northern polar stratosphere, including the influences of <b>Arctic</b> <b>meteorology,</b> and polar stratospheric clouds formed at low temperatures. Some major aspects of the AASE are described including: logistics and operations, meteorology, polar stratospheric clouds, trace composition and chemistry, and ozone depletion. It is concluded that the Arctic- 89 experiments have provided the scientific community with a wealth of new information that will contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the polar winter stratosphere and the critical problem of global ozone depletion...|$|E

This merger comprises* Joint announcements of research opportunities* Joint evaluation of research proposals by a French-German Advisory Board* Establishment of joint research projects* Common utilisation of personnel, logistics, and instrumentation* Common project administration and on-site management* Joint {{representation of the}} base* Streamlining of logistical and funding mattersThe Joint French-German Arctic Research Base has a two-fold task. It is a general platform for short, medium, and long term research projects {{in the fields of}} Atmospheric Sciences, Geo-Sciences, Marine, and Terrestrial Biology. On the other hand, it comprises a state of the art, dedicated atmospheric observatory for <b>Arctic</b> <b>meteorology,</b> atmospheric chemistry and stratospheric monitoring (ozone layer and related research). Beside passive and active remote sensing instrumentation, a modern balloon launch facility is included. The available scientific instrumentation from Alfred-Wegener-Institut, Institut Français Polair Paul Emil Victor, and Univ. of Bremen allows determining type and concentration of trace gases in the troposphere and stratosphere, as well as atmospheric aerosols. Regular meteorological balloon soundings measure the vertical distribution of temperature, water vapour pressure and ozone concentration. In addition the Joint French-German Arctic Research Base offers a range of research facilities and laboratories for scientists in the disciplines of biology, chemistry, geophysics, and atmosphere physics. The station comprises several buildings, offering accommodation for up to 16 people, laboratories and offices. In addition an external clean air station (Corbel-Station) is available outside from the village of Ny-Ålesund. There is one scientist as station leader and one engineer permanently at the station, which are supported by additional personnel from AWI and IPEV during peak periods. Details of the base are available from [URL] new International Arctic Marine Laboratory in Ny-Ålesund is available for scientific use since June 2005.

40|$|A {{realistic}} {{simulation of}} physical and dynamical processes in the Arctic atmosphere and its feedbacks with the surface conditions is still a challenge for state-of-the-art Arctic climate models. This is of critical importance because studies of, for example, transport of pollutants from middle latitudes into the Arctic rely on the skill of the model in correctly representing atmospheric circulation including the key mechanisms and pathways of pollutant transport. In this work {{the performance of the}} Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF) with two land surface model schemes (Noah and NoahMP) and two reanalysis data sets for creation of lateral boundary conditions (ERA-interim and ASR) is evaluated focusing on meteorological surface properties and atmospheric dynamics. This includes the position and displacement of the polar dome and other features characterizing atmospheric circulation associated to sea ice maxima/minima extent within the Eurasian Arctic. The model simulations analyzed are carried out at 15 -km horizontal resolution over a period of five years (2008 to 2012). The WRF model simulations are evaluated against surface meteorological data from automated weather stations and vertical profiles from radiosondes. Results show that the model is able to reproduce the main features of the atmospheric dynamics and vertical structure of the Arctic atmosphere reasonably well. The influence of the choice of the reanalyses used as initial and lateral boundary condition and of the LSM on the model results is complex and no combination is found to be clearly superior in all variables analyzed. The model results show that a more sophisticated formulation of land surface processes does not necessarily lead to significant improvements in the model results. This suggests that other factors such as the decline of the Arctic sea ice, stratosphere-troposphere interactions, atmosphere-ocean interaction, and boundary layer processes are also highly important and can have a significant influence on the model results. The “best” configuration for simulating <b>Arctic</b> <b>meteorology</b> and processes most relevant for pollutant transport (ASR + NoahMP) is then used in a simulation with WRF including aerosols and chemistry (WRF-Chem) to simulate black carbon (BC) concentrations in and around the Arctic and to assess the role of the modeled atmospheric circulation in the simulated BC concentrations inside the Arctic domain. Results from simulations with chemistry are evaluated against aerosol optical depth from several Aeronet stations and BC concentrations and particle number concentrations from several stations from the EBAS database. The results with WRF-Chem show a strong dependency of the simulated BC concentration on the modeled meteorology and the transport of the pollutants around our domain. The results also show that biases in the modeled BC concentrations can also be related to the emission data. Significant improvements of the models and of our understanding of the impact of anthropogenic BC emissions on the Arctic strongly depends on the availability of suitable, long-term observational data of concentrations of BC and particulate matter, vertical profiles of temperature and humidity and wind...|$|E
