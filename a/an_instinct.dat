5|$|Chris Boucher's five Star Cops scripts {{have been}} semi-professionally {{published}} {{in two volumes}} by Judith Proctor. The first volume <b>An</b> <b>Instinct</b> for Murder was adapted from the first Star Cops episode of the same name. The second volume Little Green Men and Other Stories included the four remaining Boucher scripts. There are some changes from the broadcast episodes – neither the characters of Alexander Krivenko nor Anna Shoun appear in these books. Krivenko {{is replaced by a}} Chinese character, Jiang Li Ho, as an attempt to update the Star Cops universe to reflect the ending of the Cold War in 1989. Shoun is replaced by an Irish character, Dana Cogill – Boucher didn't own the rights to use the Shoun character who had been created by John Collee.|$|E
5|$|Pinker's 1994 The Language Instinct was {{the first}} of several books to combine {{cognitive}} science with behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology. It introduces the science of language and popularizes Noam Chomsky's theory that language is an innate faculty of mind, with the controversial twist that the faculty for language evolved by natural selection as an adaptation for communication. Pinker criticizes several widely held ideas about language – that it needs to be taught, that people's grammar is poor and getting worse with new ways of speaking, the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis that language limits the kinds of thoughts a person can have, and that other great apes can learn languages. Pinker sees language as unique to humans, evolved to solve the specific problem of communication among social hunter-gatherers. He argues that it is as much <b>an</b> <b>instinct</b> as specialized adaptative behavior in other species, such as a spider's web-weaving or a beaver's dam-building.|$|E
5|$|In his popular books, he {{has argued}} that the human faculty for {{language}} is <b>an</b> <b>instinct,</b> an innate behavior shaped by natural selection and adapted to our communication needs. He is the author of seven books for a general audience. Five of these, The Language Instinct (1994), How the Mind Works (1997), Words and Rules (2000), The Blank Slate (2002), and The Stuff of Thought (2007), describe aspects of the field of psycholinguistics and cognitive science, and include accounts of his own research. In the sixth book, The Better Angels of Our Nature (2011), Pinker makes the case that violence in human societies has, in general, steadily declined with time, and identifies six major causes of this decline. His seventh book, The Sense of Style (2014), is intended as a general style guide that is informed by modern science and psychology, offering advice on how to produce more comprehensible and unambiguous writing in nonfiction contexts and explaining why so much of today's academic and popular writing is difficult for readers to understand.|$|E

25|$|Most notable in this line-up was Stephen Beckett in {{the lead}} role.

Although he was not drawn in specially for his role (he had appeared in Stephen Joseph Theatre productions before), Alan Ayckbourn reportedly said there was <b>an</b> <b>instinct</b> of Charlie that was like him.|$|E

However, this exterior hides an inner strength that crops up when needed. Victoria may be young, but she has <b>an</b> <b>instinct</b> for when she is being lied to, and her sensibility is a contrast to the recklessness of Jamie and the curiosity of the Doctor. Jamie, in particular, is very protective towards and fond of Victoria, and is heartbroken when she chooses to leave.|$|E
25|$|After {{working at}} Norman J. Lewis, Friedman began {{considering}} his own concepts for toy products. In 1970, he formed LJN Toys Ltd., which created toy lines {{and video games}} based on movies, television shows and celebrities. The company was established with the financial backing of Friedman's employer, Norman J. Lewis, who later sold {{his interest in the}} company to a Chinese investor. After Lewis moved on, Friedman remained committed to promoting the company's growth and focused the company's strategy toward licensing. Basing toys on popular characters wasn't a new concept, but Friedman had <b>an</b> <b>instinct</b> for recognizing blockbusters, could conceive products for diverse audiences, and could negotiate and execute licenses quickly, which brought the practice to a new level. LJN found initial success making merchandise from the film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Friedman continued to acquire licenses, personally meeting with celebrities such as Michael Jackson and Brooke Shields, before making dolls based on their figure.|$|E

500|$|One raging {{public debate}} {{involving}} language went unmentioned in The Language Instinct: the [...] "reading wars," [...] or dispute over whether {{children should be}} explicitly taught to read by decoding the sounds of words from their spelling (loosely known as [...] "phonics") or whether they can develop it instinctively by being immersed in a text-rich environment (often called [...] "whole language"). I tipped my hand in the paragraph in [...] which said that language is <b>an</b> <b>instinct</b> but reading is not. Like most psycholinguists (but apparently unlike many school boards), I think it's essential for children to be taught {{to become aware of}} speech sounds and how they are coded in strings of letters.|$|E

In April 2014 she gave concert performances in Australia. The reviewer for The Sydney Morning Herald wrote: [...] "Perhaps {{it is a matter}} of personality as much as voice: a natural warmth and <b>an</b> <b>instinct</b> for never exaggerating the emotional content of a song. Whatever the case, it is easy to see and hear why, for 30 years, Bernadette Peters has probably been musical theatre's finest performer. ... She even breathed new life into 'Send In the Clowns'. ... Rather than make it emotionally swollen (as so many do), Peters contracted it, delicately squeezing out its essence like toothpaste from a near-empty tube." [...] She gave concerts in June 2016 in the UK at the Royal Festival Hall, Manchester Opera House and Edinburgh Playhouse.|$|E

After Ziskin's death Field expressed her gratitude at being a part of both Ziskin's first and last films.

[...] Webb said that while [...] "we all love Aunt May", he wanted to create a tension between May and Peter. [...] "He's got bruises on his face, and what happens in that moment? That can create some tension, but you want there to be love there. That's what someone like Sally Field gives you." ...|$|E

500|$|The two men {{arrived in}} Montevideo for {{negotiations}} on 2 November.

A Brazilian division, along with Uruguayan and Argentine rebel troops, invaded Argentina. On 3 February 1852, the allies defeated an army led by Rosas, who fled to the United Kingdom. To Needell, Paranhos [...] "quickly adapted his own skills to the necessities of the mission. He demonstrated not only the intelligence and verbal ability expected, but a surprisingly rapid grasp of the issues and the actors, handling the complications with élan, showing a flair for decision, a capacity for work, an eye for details, and <b>an</b> <b>instinct</b> for imposing himself that won Honório 's decided approval and, after some hesitation (allegedly because Paranhos was a novice, to Paulino Soares's way of thinking), the support of Paulino [...]" [...] An ally of Brazil against Rosas {{who went on to}} become President of Argentina in 1862, Bartolomé Mitre would recall decades later that Paranhos had been the [...] "soul" [...] of the successful diplomatic mission headed by Carneiro Leão.|$|E
500|$|Psychoanalytic {{concepts}} influenced Bowlby's view of attachment, in particular, {{the observations}} by Anna Freud and Dorothy Burlingham {{of young children}} separated from familiar caregivers during World War II. However, Bowlby rejected psychoanalytical explanations for early infant bonds including [...] "drive theory" [...] in which the motivation for attachment derives from gratification of hunger and libidinal drives. He called this the [...] "cupboard-love" [...] theory of relationships. In his view it failed to see attachment as a psychological bond {{in its own right}} rather than <b>an</b> <b>instinct</b> derived from feeding or sexuality. Based on ideas of primary attachment and Neo-Darwinism, Bowlby identified what he saw as fundamental flaws in psychoanalysis: the overemphasis of internal dangers rather than external threat, and the view of the development of personality via linear phases with regression to fixed points accounting for psychological distress. Bowlby instead posited that several lines of development were possible, the outcome of which depended on the interaction between the organism and the environment. In attachment this would mean that although a developing child has a propensity to form attachments, the nature of those attachments depends on the environment to which the child is exposed.|$|E

2500|$|Despite her {{closeness}} {{to the central}} figures of both psychoanalysis and developmental psychology {{in the first part}} of the twentieth century, Spielrein was more or less forgotten in Western Europe after her departure for Moscow in 1923. Her tragic death in the Holocaust compounded this erasure. The publication in 1974, of the correspondence between Freud and Jung, followed by the discovery of her personal papers and publication of some of them in the 1980s onwards, made her name quite widely known. However, it led to her identification in popular culture as an erotic sideshow in the lives of the two men. Within the world of psychoanalysis, Spielrein is usually given no more than a footnote, for her conception of the sexual drive as containing both <b>an</b> <b>instinct</b> of destruction and <b>an</b> <b>instinct</b> of transformation, hence anticipating both Freud's [...] "death drive" [...] and Jung's views on [...] "transformation"; ...|$|E
