40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis project gives the user of the HP- 4441 handheld programmable calculator {{a series of}} programs that give acceptable results during the preliminary phases of the helicopter design process. The project consists of three parts. The first part consists of several short programs and the subroutine form. These programs and subroutines compute density altitude, density, disc area, solidity, tip velocity, induced velocity, coefficient of thrust, tip loss factor, equivalent chord, and ground effect. The second part consists of major subroutines. These subroutines compute profile power, induced power, climb power, parasite power, and total power; equivalent area and induced power for a tandem rotor and data input and change. The third part consists of the main programs. These programs computer the various power requirements for hovering flight, forward (straight and level) flight, vertical flight, and forward climbing flight; also tailrotor power, <b>autorotative</b> <b>flight,</b> and tandem rotor flight.

40|$|The {{simulation}} {{and flight}} testing {{of a light}} gyroplane aircraft is performed obtaining results regarding the flight dynamics attributes of the vehicle. The main aim of the work {{was to assess the}} ability of a mathematical model to simulate rotorcraft in the <b>autorotative</b> <b>flight</b> state. Additionally, the results acquired were to enhance the understanding of an aircraft class for which the existing database of knowledge is limited, particularly with regards to its flight mechanics characteristics. An appropriate aircraft configuration file was obtained enabling a platform of simulation results to be generated. Parametric studies were performed primarily focusing on the influence of the vertical centre of gravity position and rotor speed degree of freedom on gyroplane longitudinal stability. A data acquisition system unique in its sophistication for this class of aircraft was developed and installed on board. The software required to drive the system was designed, and rigorous tests verifying the instrumentation functionality were conducted both on ground and in real flight. A flight test programme capable of fulfilling the experimental aims was devised and realised, yielding results both on the steady state flight characteristics of the aircraft and its dynamic response to pilot inputs. Certain trends were established on the properties of gyroplanes by interpreting the results in terms of basic aerodynamic theory, and by comparing them to previous research findings. A comparison of the experimental data to that obtained from the simulation runs, served to fulfil the model validation aim of the work presented. The effect of model and flight discrepancies on the ability of the mathematical model to realistically emulate flight dynamics in autorotation was discussed, and possible suggestions for the reasons of mismatch were presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{gyroplane}} {{represents the}} first successful rotorcraft design and it {{paved the way for}} the development of the helicopter during the 1940 s. Gyroplane rotors are not powered in flight and work in autorotative regime and hence the characteristics of a helicopter rotor during powered flight and a rotor in autorotation differ significantly. Gyroplanes in the UK have been involved in number of fatal accidents during the last two decades. Despite several research projects focused on gyroplane flight dynamics, the cause of some of gyroplane accidents still remains unclear. The aeroelastic behaviour of autorotating rotors is a relatively unexplored problem and it has not yet been investigated as possible cause of the accidents. A mathematical model was created to simulate aeroelastic behaviour of rotors in autorotation. The model can investigate couplings between blade teeter, bending, torsion and rotor speed using a finite element model combined with a blade element method and a dynamic inflow model. A set of 'McCutcheon' rotor blades was subjected to a series of experiments, yielding baseline input parameters for the model. The model was validated against published results of modal analysis of helicopter rotor blades, experimental flight measurements and other data published in open literature. Effect of selected rotor design parameters on performance and stability of autorotating rotors was analyzed. Results of the model suggest that steady <b>autorotative</b> <b>flight</b> is not possible for excessive values of blade fixed incidence angle or geometric twist of the blade, leading to an aeromechanical instability. Negative values of these parameters lead to rotor over-speed, loss of rotor thrust and increase in vehicle speed of descent. The simulations have shown that moderate values of blade geometric twist applied to the inboard region of the blade together with blade tip mass can improve stability of a rotor in autorotation. A significant part of the research was focused on investigation of the effect of different values of torsional and flexural stiffness, and the relative chord-wise positions of blade elastic axis and centre of mass on rotor stability during autorotation. The results obtained from the model demonstrate an interesting and unique characteristic of the autorotative regime. Coupled flap-twist-rotor speed oscillations of the rotor occur if the torsional stiffness of the blade is lower than a critical value and if the blade centre of mass is aft of the blade elastic axis. The new type of aeroelastic instability is specific to autorotating rotors and differs from both helicopter rotor flutter and fixed-wing flutter. An extra degree of freedom in rotor speed does not alter flutter onset point significantly and hence this instability can be classified as pitch-flap flutter, with the stability boundary of a hyperbolic shape. However, variation of rotor speed in response to coupled flexural and torsional dynamics of the rotor blades changes behaviour of the rotor during the instability. The coupling of rotor teeter, blade torsion and rotor speed with vehicle speed of descent results in a combined flutter and divergence instability. The investigation aeroelastic behaviour of rotors in autorotation has shown that although autorotation has strong autostabilizing character, catastrophic aeroelastic instability can occur. Aeroelastic instability of this type has not been previously described in open literature. The instability can be initiated by incorrect mass balance of the rotor blades together with their insufficient torsional stiffness. Alternatively, unsuitable rotor geometry causing excessive blade incidence can prevent the rotor from entering steady autorotation. Hence a rotor in autorotation with unsuitable design of rotor blades can encounter an aeroelastic instability even if it is correctly mass balanced.
