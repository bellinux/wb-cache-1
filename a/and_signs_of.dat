Inside, they find makeshift barricades <b>and</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> a struggle, but no bodies; two live facehuggers in containment tanks in the medical lab; and a traumatized young girl nicknamed Newt, the sole survivor, who used the extensive ventilation system to evade capture or death. The crew uses the colony's computer to locate the colonists grouped beneath the fusion powered atmosphere processing station. They head to the location, descending into corridors covered in alien secretions.|$|E
5|$|Encephalopathy often occurs {{together}} with other symptoms <b>and</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> liver failure. These may include jaundice (yellow discolouration of the skin and the whites of the eyes), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), and peripheral edema (swelling of the legs due to fluid build-up in the skin). The tendon reflexes may be exaggerated, and the plantar reflex may be abnormal, namely extending rather than flexing (Babinski's sign) in severe encephalopathy. A particular smell (foetor hepaticus) may be detected.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs are prey animals whose {{survival}} {{instinct is}} to mask pain <b>and</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> illness, and many times health problems may not be apparent until a condition is severe or in its advanced stages. Treatment of disease is made more difficult by the extreme sensitivity guinea pigs have to most antibiotics, including penicillin, which kill off the intestinal flora and quickly bring on episodes of diarrhea and in some cases, death.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{reflection}} and photoluminescence spectra of modulation-doped CdTe/CdMgTe quantum-well structures have been studied. It {{was found that}} the magnitude <b>and</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> the Zeeman splitting of the trion reflection line depend on the electron concentration in the quantum well, whereas the magnitude <b>and</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> the splitting of the exciton line are absolutely the same for all the electron concentrations under study. In the photoluminescence spectra, the magnitude <b>and</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> the Zeeman splittings for the exciton and trion were the same. This "renormalization" of the trion g factor is explained in terms of the model of combined exciton-electron processes...|$|R

5|$|It is a {{systematic}} {{collection of data}} based on observation of the patient's behavior while the patient is in the clinician's view during the interview. The purpose is to obtain evidence of symptoms <b>and</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> mental disorders, including danger to self and others, that are present {{at the time of}} the interview. Further, information on the patient's insight, judgment, and capacity for abstract reasoning is used to inform decisions about treatment strategy and the choice of an appropriate treatment setting.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{approaches}} to treating Chagas disease: antiparasitic treatment, {{to kill the}} parasite; and symptomatic treatment, to manage the symptoms <b>and</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> the infection. Management uniquely involves addressing selective incremental failure of the parasympathetic nervous system. Autonomic disease imparted by Chagas may eventually result in megaesophagus, megacolon and accelerated dilated cardiomyopathy. The mechanisms that explain why Chagas targets the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system and spares the sympathetic autonomic nervous system remain poorly understood.|$|E

5|$|A cancer-stricken Hadden, now in {{residence}} on the Mir space station, reveals to Arroway {{that a second}} machine was secretly made in Japan, and that Arroway {{will be the one}} to go. Outfitted with several recording devices, Arroway enters the machine's pod, which is then dropped into four rapidly spinning rings, causing the pod to apparently travel through a series of wormholes. Arroway sees a radio array-like structure at Vega <b>and</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> an advanced civilization on another planet. She then finds herself on a beach, similar to a childhood picture she drew of Florida, and a figure approaches that becomes her deceased father. Arroway recognizes him as an alien taking her father's form and attempts to ask questions. The alien tells her that the familiar landscape and form were used to make their first contact easier for her and that this journey was just humanity's first step to joining other spacefaring species.|$|E
5|$|The Gypsy Restaurant and Velvet Lounge was a {{restaurant}} and nightclub established in 1947 and located along Northwest 21st Avenue in the Northwest District neighborhood of Portland, Oregon, in the United States. Popular with young adults, the restaurant was known for serving fishbowl alcoholic beverages, for its 1950s furnishings, and for hosting karaoke, trivia competitions and goldfish racing tournaments. The restaurant {{is said to have}} influenced local alcohol policies; noise complaints <b>and</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> drunken behavior by patrons made the business a target for curfews and closure. Concept Entertainment owned the restaurant from 1992 until 2014, when it was closed unexpectedly.|$|E
5|$|There is {{one case}} study on maltreated twins {{published}} in 1999 with a follow-up in 2006. This study assessed the twins {{between the ages of}} 19 and 36 months, during which time they suffered multiple moves and placements. The paper explores the similarities, differences and comorbidity of RAD, disorganized attachment and post traumatic stress disorder. The girl showed signs of the inhibited form of RAD while the boy showed signs of the indiscriminate form. It was noted that the diagnosis of RAD ameliorated with better care but symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder <b>and</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> disorganized attachment came and went as the infants progressed through multiple placement changes. At age three, some lasting relationship disturbance was evident.|$|E
