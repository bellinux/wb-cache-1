25|$|I'm {{just happy}} to be here. I think being a young artist, just {{starting}} out of high school, what kids listen to is club music. We don't necessarily get too deep or sing like Aretha Franklin. That's not even what music is truly <b>about</b> <b>today.</b> It's sad, but when I want to give a little bit of sex, being fabulous or sassy. I definitely {{want to be able to}} sing and back that up, and being a dancer first has sort of given me a complex that I have to be able to sing, period, with a band. If I break my leg, I'd like to give a show without pyrotechnics and choreography every five seconds.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, Garcia {{began playing}} a sunburst Les Paul. That March, he {{received}} a guitar that little is known <b>about</b> <b>today.</b> It {{is said to be}} an early Alembic project or referred to as Peanut. In May, Garcia began using a 1957 natural finish Stratocaster that had been given to him by Graham Nash. Garcia added the Alligator sticker to the pickguard in the fall of that year. Heavily modified by Alembic throughout 1971-1973, Alligator would remain Garcia's principal electric guitar until August 1973. In the summer of 1971, Garcia also played a double-cutaway Les Paul TV Junior. While Alligator was in the shop in the summer of 1972, he briefly reverted to the sunburst Stratocaster; this can be seen in Sunshine Daydream.|$|E
25|$|Journalist and {{historian}} Peter Hennessy {{has made an}} assertion, {{in one of his}} books, that a test that the commander of a British nuclear-missile submarine must use to determine whether the UK has been the target of a nuclear attack (in which case he has sealed orders which may authorise him to fire his nuclear missiles in retaliation), is to listen for the presence of Today on Radio 4's frequencies. If a certain number of days (said to be three) pass without the programme being broadcast, that is to be taken as evidence that the orders must be executed. The true conditions are of course secret, and Hennessy has never revealed his sources for this story, leading Paul Donovan, author of a book <b>about</b> <b>Today,</b> to express some scepticism about it. However, the longwave signal of Radio 4 is capable of penetrating to surface depths where submarines can rise, although it does not have the range required to be heard at this depth far from the UK's coastal waters.|$|E

500|$|Commercially unsuccessful, Barbra Streisand...and Other Musical Instruments is Streisand's lowest-selling album {{released}} by Columbia {{and one of}} four studio albums {{that have not been}} certified by the Recording Industry Association of America (the other three being 1969's What <b>About</b> <b>Today?,</b> 2011's What Matters Most, and 2016's [...] ). In the United States, the album debuted on the Billboard 200 at number 146 for the week ending November 24, 1973. Within two weeks it rose 71 places to number 75, before reaching its peak position at number 64 on December 22. It spent a total of sixteen consecutive weeks on the Billboard 200. Paul Grein, writer of the [...] "Chart Beat" [...] column for Billboard, noted that Barbra Streisand...and Other Musical Instruments was one of Streisand's few releases to miss peaking within the top 15 of the chart. Meanwhile, the record entered Canada's chart (compiled by RPM) at number 81 on January 1, 1974. However, it dropped to number 88 the following week and on February 2, 1974, it peaked at number 80, which was also the final publication that the album would appear on, totaling four weeks altogether.|$|E

[...] Virgin Galactic is proceeding with its plans for space flight and is building another craft; company officials said that their commitment to commercial spacecraft had not wavered despite the crash and they expected the company to resume test flights later in 2015, though that date subsequently slipped.|$|E
