2500|$|Imprisoned in Rhode Island, it {{took about}} two weeks for Weeks to decide to co-operate with authorities, leading some in South Boston to dub him [...] "Kevin Squeaks" [...] or [...] "Two Weeks".

Remember you can't rat on a rat. Those guys have been giving up everyone for thirty years." [...] He was also unnerved by the prospect of spending {{the rest of his life}} in prison. [...] In addition, Weeks was also deeply impressed by the cooperation of John Martorano, a legendary enforcer for the Winter Hill Gang.|$|E

6000|$|... "Precisely! Well, what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do now? Are you {{satisfied}} with your first reverse, or <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> renew the experiment?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> remedy it, how <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> protect that Great State of {{your dreams}} from this anti-citizenship of sex? You give no hint.|$|R
6000|$|... "Use? It ruined me! But what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do? How <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> presuppose that a {{girl like}} Miss Pasmer is {{interested}} in an idiot like you? I mean me, of course." [...] Mavering broke off with a dolorous laugh. [...] "And if you can't presuppose it, what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do {{when it comes to}} the point? You've got to shillyshally, and then you've got to go it blind. I tell you it's a leap in the dark." ...|$|R

5000|$|Because {{the noodles}} are {{traditionally}} eaten at weddings, the expression [...] "When <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> feed us guksu?" [...] {{is a way}} of asking [...] "When <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get married?" [...] and a wedding day might be referred as [...] "a day to eat guksu".|$|R
