5|$|Antbirds are diurnal: they feed, breed {{and defend}} territories during the day. Many {{of the family}} are, however, {{reluctant}} to enter areas of direct sunlight where it breaks through the forest canopy. Antbirds will engage in <b>anting,</b> a behaviour in which ants (or other arthropods) are rubbed on the feathers before being discarded or eaten. While this has conventionally been considered a way to remove and control feather parasites, {{it has been suggested}} that for antbirds it may simply be a way to deal with the distasteful substances in prey items.|$|E

5|$|Feathers require {{maintenance}} and birds preen or groom them daily, spending {{an average of}} around 9% of their daily time on this. The bill is used to brush away foreign particles and to apply waxy secretions from the uropygial gland; these secretions protect the feathers' flexibility and act as an antimicrobial agent, inhibiting the growth of feather-degrading bacteria. This may be supplemented with the secretions of formic acid from ants, which birds receive through a behaviour known as <b>anting,</b> to remove feather parasites.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} focused on the {{dominance}} exerted by the invasive Argentine <b>ant</b> over native <b>ants</b> in a coastal Mediterranean area. The impact of this invasive <b>ant</b> on native <b>ant</b> assemblages and its conse-quences on total <b>ant</b> biomass and on the intensity of habitat exploration were evaluated.

25|$|Birds {{maintain}} their feather condition by bathing in water, dust bathing, and preening. It {{has been suggested}} that a peculiar behavior of birds, <b>anting,</b> in which ants are introduced into the plumage, helps to reduce parasites, but no supporting evidence has been found.|$|E
25|$|Another {{suggested}} function, {{based on}} observation of blue jays, {{is that the}} bird makes the insects edible, by discharging the harmful acid onto their feathers.

500|$|Also defined herewith: passive <b>anting.</b> A self-anointing {{behaviour}} {{during which}} birds rub insects, usually ants, on their [...] and skin. The bird may {{pick up the}} insects in their [...] and rub them on the body, or the bird may lie {{in an area of}} high density of the insects and perform dust bathing-like movements. The insects secrete liquids containing chemicals such as formic acid, which can act as an insecticide, miticide, fungicide or bactericide. Alternatively, <b>anting</b> could make the insects edible by removing the distasteful acid, or, possibly supplement the bird's own preen oil. Instead of ants, some birds can also use millipedes. More than 200 species of bird are known to ant. The practice may be called [...] "passive anting", when a bird simply positions itself to allow ants to crawl through its plumage.|$|E

40|$|Biotic {{interactions}} are often {{important in the}} establishment and spread of invasive species. In particular, competition between introduced and native species can strongly influence the distribution and spread of exotic species {{and in some cases}} competition among introduced species can be important. The Caribbean crazy <b>ant,</b> Nylanderia fulva, was recently introduced to the Gulf Coast of Texas, and appears to be spreading inland. It has been hypothesized that competition with the red imported fire <b>ant,</b> Solenopsis invicta, may be an important factor in the spread of crazy <b>ants.</b> We investigated the potential of interspecific competition among these two introduced <b>ants</b> by measuring interspecific aggression between Caribbean crazy <b>ant</b> workers and workers of Solenopsis invicta. Specifically, we examined the effect of body size and diet on individual-level aggressive interactions among crazy <b>ant</b> workers and fire <b>ants.</b> We found that differences in diet did not alter interactions between crazy <b>ant</b> workers from different nests, but carbohydrate level did {{play an important role in}} antagonistic interactions with fire ants: crazy <b>ants</b> on low sugar diets were more aggressive and less likely to be killed in aggressive encounters with fire <b>ants.</b> We found that large fire <b>ants</b> engaged in fewer fights with crazy <b>ants</b> than small fire <b>ants,</b> but fire <b>ant</b> size affected neither fire <b>ant</b> nor crazy <b>ant</b> mortality. Overall, crazy <b>ants</b> experienced higher mortality than fire <b>ants</b> after aggressive encounters. Our findings suggest that fire <b>ant</b> workers might outcompete crazy <b>ant</b> workers on an individual level, providing some biotic resistance to crazy <b>ant</b> range expansion. However, this resistance may be overcome by crazy <b>ants</b> that have a restricted sugar intake, which may occur when crazy <b>ants</b> are excluded from resources by fire <b>ants...</b>|$|R

500|$|Army ants forage {{in a wide}} roving column, attacking any {{animals in}} that path that are unable to escape. In Central and South America, Eciton burchellii is the {{swarming}} ant most commonly attended by [...] "ant-following" [...] birds such as antbirds and woodcreepers. This behaviour was once considered mutualistic, but later studies found the birds to be parasitic. Direct kleptoparasitism (birds stealing food from the ants' grasp) is rare and has been noted in Inca doves which pick seeds at nest entrances as they are being transported by species of Pogonomyrmex. Birds that follow ants eat many prey insects and thus decrease the foraging success of ants. Birds indulge in a peculiar behaviour called <b>anting</b> that, as yet, is not fully understood. Here birds rest on ant nests, or pick and drop ants onto their wings and feathers; {{this may be a}} means to remove ectoparasites from the birds.|$|E
500|$|Two {{members of}} the CRG played a {{significant}} part in the affair over the Shanghai Commune.

While some birds dip into shallow water, more aerial species may make aerial dips into water and arboreal species often make use of dew or rain that collect on leaves. Birds of arid regions make use of loose soil to dust-bathe. A behaviour termed as <b>anting</b> in which the bird encourages ants to run through their plumage is also thought to help them reduce the ectoparasite load in feathers. Many species will spread out their wings and expose them to direct sunlight and this too is thought to help in reducing fungal and ectoparasitic activity that may lead to feather damage.|$|E
