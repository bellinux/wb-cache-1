5|$|During Hygeberht's archbishopric, joint synods for {{the provinces}} of Lichfield and Canterbury were held, presided over by both archbishops. These gatherings were canonically irregular, as the usual {{procedure}} was for each province to hold its own synod. The reasons for holding joint councils are unclear; {{they may have been}} a manifestation of Offa's desire to supervise the entire southern church, or <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> archbishops of Canterbury to retain some authority over the province of Lichfield.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944 the Allies {{launched}} Operation Market Garden, <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British 2nd Army {{to bypass}} the Siegfried Line and advance into the Ruhr, Germany's industrial heartland. The operation required the 1st Airborne Corps to seize several bridges over rivers and canals in the Netherlands, allowing ground forces to advance rapidly through the Netherlands and cross the River Rhine.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the United States posed a grain embargo upon the Soviet Union. This was <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> U.S. utilize food power, however, {{it was not}} confirmed. The Soviets thus {{imported}} grain from different suppliers, leading {{to an increase in}} grain imports during that time period, only at a higher cost. Another unsuccessful embargo food power attempt was imposed by the UN Security Council in 1990 with Iraq.|$|E

5|$|Using forces {{delivered}} to Guadalcanal in this manner, the Japanese army tried {{three times to}} retake Henderson Field, but was defeated each time. After the third failure, <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> IJN to deliver {{the rest of the}} IJA 38th Infantry Division and its heavy equipment failed during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal from 12–15 November. Because of this failure, the Japanese cancelled their next planned attempt to recapture Henderson Field.|$|E
5|$|An ouster {{clause in}} a statute is <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{legislature}} {{to prevent an}} act or decision by a public authority from being challenged before the courts. Such clauses thus serve as a signal to decision-makers that they may operate without fear of intervention by the courts at a later stage. One common kind of ouster clause is the total ouster or finality clause, which is inserted into a statute {{to indicate that the}} decision of a particular judge or tribunal is final and cannot be challenged by any court.|$|E

On November 1, 1943. The Allies intended {{to establish a}} beachhead around Cape Torokina, within which an airfield would be built. Allied forces did not plan, at that time, to try to capture the entire island of Bougainville from Japanese forces. <b>An</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Japanese Navy to attack the U.S. landing forces was defeated in the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay, between November 1 and November 2. A subsequent attempt by Japanese land forces to attack the Allied beachhead was defeated in the Battle of Koromokina Lagoon.|$|E

5|$|In May 2007, Griffin {{was invited}} to address {{a meeting at the}} University of Bath by {{politics}} student and BNP youth leader Danny Lake. Lake wanted Griffin to visit the university and explain the BNP's policies to lecturers and students. The invitation was viewed by some as <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> party to establish a foothold on the university campus. Eleven union general secretaries wrote to the university's vice-chancellor and asked her to reconsider the decision to allow the meeting. A large protest was planned, and following students' concerns over their personal safety, the University cancelled the invitation.|$|E
5|$|In November 1901 the fedayi {{clashed with}} the Ottoman troops in what later {{became known as the}} Battle of Holy Apostles Monastery. One of the best-known episodes of Andranik's revolutionary activities, it was <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman {{government}} to suppress his activities. Since Andranik had gained more influence over the region, more than 5,000 Turkish soldiers were sent after him and his band. The Turks chased and eventually circled him and his men, numbering around 50, at the Arakelots (Holy Apostles) Monastery in early November. A regiment under the command of Ferikh Pasha and Ali Pasha besieged the fort-like monastery. The Turkish generals leading the army of twelve hundred men asked the fedayi to negotiate their surrender.|$|E

5|$|Lice {{may reduce}} host life {{expectancy}} if the infestation is heavy, but most {{seem to have}} little effect on their host. The habit of dust bathing in domestic hens is probably <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> birds to rid themselves of lice. Lice may transmit microbial diseases and helminth parasites, but most individuals spend their whole life cycle on a single host and are only able to transfer to a new host opportunistically. Ischnoceran lice may reduce the thermoregulation effect of the plumage; thus heavily infested birds lose more heat than others.|$|E
5|$|Operation Bodenplatte (Baseplate), {{launched}} on 1 January 1945, was <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Luftwaffe to cripple Allied air {{forces in the}} Low Countries during the Second World War. The goal of Bodenplatte was to gain air superiority during the stagnant stage of the Battle of the Bulge so that the German Army and Waffen-SS forces could resume their advance. The operation was planned for 16 December 1944, but was delayed repeatedly due to bad weather until New Year’s Day, the first day that happened to be suitable.|$|E
5|$|Robert died {{fighting}} the Scots {{at the battle}} of Bannockburn and the region around the castle was attacked in 1314 and 1319, causing significant damage to neighbouring Church Brough. Around this time the village of Market Brough was established along the road overlooked by the castle, in <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Cliffords to maximise the possibilities for profits from trade along the valley. Market Brough acquired a royal charter in 1330 and seems to have rapidly overtaken Church Brough as the main settlement in the area.|$|E

5|$|The Hoare–Laval Pact of December 1935 was <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare and the French Prime Minister Pierre Laval {{to end the}} {{conflict}} in Abyssinia by proposing to partition the country into an Italian sector and an Abyssinian sector. Mussolini was prepared {{to agree to the}} pact, but news of the deal leaked out. Both the British and French public vehemently protested against it, describing it as a sell-out of Abyssinia. Hoare and Laval were forced to resign, and the British and French governments dissociated themselves from the two men. In June 1936, although there was no precedent for a head of state addressing the Assembly of the League of Nations in person, Haile Selassie spoke to the Assembly, appealing for its help in protecting his country.|$|E
5|$|The Stoßtrupp was {{abolished}} {{after the}} failed 1923 Beer Hall Putsch, <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> NSDAP to seize power in Munich. In 1925, Hitler ordered Schreck {{to organize a}} new bodyguard unit, the Schutzkommando (Protection Command). It was tasked with providing personal protection for Hitler at NSDAP functions and events. That same year, the Schutzkommando was expanded to a national organization and renamed successively the Sturmstaffel (Storm Squadron), and finally the Schutzstaffel (Protection Squad; SS). Officially, the SS marked its foundation on 9 November 1925 (the second anniversary of the Beer Hall Putsch). The new SS was to provide protection for NSDAP leaders throughout Germany. Hitler's personal SS protection unit was later enlarged to include combat units.|$|E
5|$|The first White House Astronomy Night {{was held}} on the South Lawn on October 7, 2009. This first event coincided with the International Year of Astronomy.
