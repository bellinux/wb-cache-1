40|$|Although {{consumers}} {{express a}} growing expectation in finding clear, credible {{and easy to}} understand label, presented in food products, studies confirm that European consumers have difficulties in understanding and use nutritional labelling in the format currently existing in the European Union. To overcome this situation, the European Union issued a new food information regulation on the provision of information on food consumers {{to be in force}} from 13 December 2014. The proposal took into account the need to simplify and consolidate the plethora of legal acts on labelling, to accommodate what consumers have shown to need, as well as improving nutrition information in order to help them make informed and healthier choices. The aim {{of this study was to}} understand in depth the largest Portuguese manufactures and retailers’ nutrition labelling practices in the light of the acceptance of the new food information regulation. A qualitative study has been developed and an interview guide was designed through food business operators, taking into account barriers and opportunities for food business operators and consumers face the new nutrition labels. Although the majority of the ten respondents had a positive opinion on a unique regulation, they also addressed the minimum character size, that acts as a barrier to marketing actions, because with this limitation they do not have space to provide voluntary information on the: product (e. g. claims, “kosher”), production method (e. g. organic), package (e. g. PET recycling), and corporate social commitments. Industry operators also worry about the obligation of the country of origin labelling inclusion. Most participants identify a number of benefits for the consumer like: allergen communication in non-pre-packed food, improved clarity of labels, mandatory <b>nutrition</b> <b>declaration</b> and, the harmonisation of rules. However, food operators considered the presence of confusing information, like changes in <b>nutrition</b> <b>declaration</b> (e. g. replacement of “sodium” to “salt”) and origin labelling in processed foods...|$|R

40|$|To {{examine the}} impact on infant and young child {{nutrition}} knowledge and practice of mothers who were neighbors of mothers participating in <b>a</b> <b>nutrition</b> Behavior Change Communication (BCC) intervention in rural Bangladesh. We analyzed data from 300 mothers whose neighbor participated in <b>a</b> <b>nutrition</b> BCC intervention and 600 mothers whose neighbor participated in an intervention that did not include BCC. We constructed measures capturing mothers' knowledge of infant and young child nutrition (IYCN) and measures of food consumption by children 6 - 24 m. The effect on these outcomes of exposure to a neighbor receiving <b>a</b> <b>nutrition</b> BCC intervention was estimated using ordinary least squares and probit regressions. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials. gov (Study ID: NCT 02237144). Having a neighboring mother participate in <b>a</b> <b>nutrition</b> BCC intervention increased non-participant mothers' IYCN knowledge by 0. 17 SD (translating to 0. 3 more correct answers). They were 14. 1 percentage points more likely to feed their 6 - 24 m children legumes and nuts; 11. 6 percentage points more likely to feed these children vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables; and 10. 0 percentage points more likely to feed these children eggs. Children of non-participant mothers who had a neighboring mother participate in <b>a</b> <b>nutrition</b> BCC intervention were 13. 8 percentage points more likely to meet World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for minimum diet diversity, 11. 9 percentage points more likely to meet WHO guidelines for minimum acceptable diet, and 10. 3 percentage points more likely to meet WHO guidelines for minimum meal frequency for children who continue to be breastfed after age 6 m. Children aged 0 - 6 m of non-participant mothers who are neighbors of mothers receiving BCC were 7. 1 percentage points {{less likely to have}} ever consumed water-based liquids.
