40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{exposure}} of superhydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coatings to common <b>aqueous</b> <b>solutions</b> which are used in biology, biotechnology and chemical sensor applications. Advancing contact angles as high as 173 ◦ for <b>aqueous</b> <b>solutions</b> were measured on the PTFE surface. Water drop sliding angles at 2 ◦ show a very low contact angle hysteresis. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements confirm that <b>aqueous</b> <b>solutions</b> can move or stay on the superhydrophobic surface without contamination. Owing to the chemical inertness of the polymer, {{these results indicate that}} superhydrophobic PTFE can be used in lab-on-a-chip and multi-sensor devices as well as in biological cultures, where <b>aqueous</b> <b>solutions</b> meet solid surfaces, without contaminating the interface. 1...|$|R
5|$|Although usually trivalent, {{ytterbium}} readily forms divalent compounds. This {{behavior is}} unusual for lanthanides, which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of +3. The +2 {{state has a}} valence electron configuration of 4f14 because the fully filled f-shell gives more stability. The yellow-green ytterbium(II) ion {{is a very strong}} reducing agent and decomposes water, releasing hydrogen gas, and thus only the colorless ytterbium(III) ion occurs in <b>aqueous</b> <b>solution.</b> Samarium and thulium also behave this way in the +2 state, but europium(II) is stable in <b>aqueous</b> <b>solution.</b> Ytterbium metal behaves similarly to europium metal and the alkaline earth metals, dissolving in ammonia to form blue electride salts.|$|E

The chemical properties of nobelium are not completely known: they are mostly only known in <b>aqueous</b> <b>solution.</b> Before nobelium's discovery, {{it was predicted that}} it would show a stable +2 oxidation state as well as the +3 state characteristic of the other actinides: these predictions were later confirmed, as the +2 state is much more stable than the +3 state in <b>aqueous</b> <b>solution</b> {{and it is difficult to}} keep nobelium in the +3 state.|$|E
5|$|Dissolving praseodymium(IV) {{compounds}} in water results in solutions containing the yellow Pr4+ ions; {{because of the}} high positive standard reduction potential of the Pr4+/Pr3+ couple at +3.2V, these ions are unstable in <b>aqueous</b> <b>solution,</b> oxidising water and being reduced to Pr3+.

5|$|It {{has been}} speculated that the 7s {{electrons}} are relativistically stabilized, so that in reducing conditions, only the 7p1/2 or 6d electron would be ionized, leading to the monovalent Lr+ ion. However, all experiments to reduce Lr3+ to Lr2+ or Lr+ in <b>aqueous</b> <b>solution</b> were unsuccessful, similarly to lutetium. On the basis of this, the standard electrode potential of the E°(Lr3+→Lr+) couple was calculated {{to be less than}} −1.56V, indicating that the existence of Lr+ ions in <b>aqueous</b> <b>solution</b> was unlikely. The upper limit for the E°(Lr3+→Lr2+) couple was predicted to be −0.44V: the values for E°(Lr3+→Lr) and E°(Lr4+→Lr3+) are predicted to be −2.06V and +7.9V. The stability of the group oxidation state in the 6d transition series decreases as RfIV > DbV > SgVI, and lawrencium continues the trend with LrIII being more stable than RfIV.|$|E

5|$|One {{of the few}} notable {{differences}} between the chemistry of yttrium {{and that of the}} lanthanides is that yttrium is almost exclusively trivalent, whereas about half the lanthanides can have valences other than three; nevertheless, only for four of the fifteen lanthanides are these other valences important in <b>aqueous</b> <b>solution</b> (CeIV, SmII, EuII, and YbII).|$|E

5|$|As {{a strong}} acid, HCl {{has a large}} Ka. Theoretical {{attempts}} to assign a Ka to HCl have been made.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In general, intermolecular {{distances}} in condensed phases at the angstrom {{scale are}} difficult to measure.

In the crystalline samples, the closest anion distance was determined to be 3. 9 ± 0. 3 Å, consistent with the XRD result. In the 1. 8 and 1 M KSCN <b>aqueous</b> <b>solutions,</b> the anion distances in the ion clusters were determined to be 4. 4 ± 0. 4 Å. The clustered anion distances in <b>aqueous</b> <b>solutions</b> are very similar to the closest anion distance in the KSCN crystal but significantly shorter than the average anion distance (0. 94 − 1. 17 nm) in the <b>aqueous</b> <b>solutions</b> if ion clustering did not occur.

5|$|In 1967, {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} compare nobelium's chemical behavior to that of terbium, californium, and fermium. All four elements were reacted with chlorine and the resulting chlorides were deposited along a tube, along which they were carried by a gas. It {{was found that the}} nobelium chloride produced was strongly adsorbed on solid surfaces, proving that it was not very volatile, like the chlorides of the other three investigated elements. However, both NoCl2 and NoCl3 were expected to exhibit nonvolatile behavior and hence this experiment was inconclusive as to what the preferred oxidation state of nobelium was. Determination of nobelium's favoring of the +2 state had to wait until the next year, when cation-exchange chromatography and coprecipitation {{experiments were}} carried out on around fifty thousand 255No atoms, finding that it behaved differently from the other actinides and more like the divalent alkaline earth metals. This proved that in <b>aqueous</b> <b>solution,</b> nobelium is most stable in the divalent state when strong oxidizers are absent. Later experimentation in 1974 showed that nobelium eluted with the alkaline earth metals, between Ca2+ and Sr2+. Nobelium is the only f-block element for which the +2 state is the most common and stable one in <b>aqueous</b> <b>solution.</b> This occurs because of the large energy gap between the 5f and 6d orbitals {{at the end of the}} actinide series.|$|E
