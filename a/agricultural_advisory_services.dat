50|$|The UK's National <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Service</b> (NAAS) was {{established}} in 1946 as the advisory and research arm of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) because of the harsh food rationing of World War II that continued in the UK into the early 1950s. Plant pathology, entomology, soil and other specialist advisers throughout the country advised farmers and growers how to maximise their output.|$|R

25|$|At a time {{of world}} food shortages, it was vital that farmers {{produced}} the maximum possible quantities. The government encouraged farmers via subsidies for modernisation, while the National <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Service</b> provided expertise and price guarantees. As {{a result of the}} Attlee Government's initiatives in agriculture, there was a 20% increase in output between 1947 and 1952, while Britain adopted one of the most mechanised and efficient farming industries in the world.|$|R
50|$|<b>Agricultural</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Service</b> makes {{efforts to}} find the {{possibilities}} to intensify truck farming in greenhouses, {{which is the most}} intensive form of vegetable growing. So far there are 11 greenhouses the total area of which is 1100 sq meters. The average production of tomatoes and peppers in greenhouses amounts to 2000 kilos and 1000 kilos respectively, which is in accordance with the expected quantities. The farmers are satisfied with both the production and profit.|$|R
50|$|Gender blind {{policies}} {{should also}} address an important barrier, which is access to <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> for women.

40|$|The article {{provides}} {{a conceptual framework}} and discusses research methods for analyzing pluralistic <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services.</b> The framework can also assist policy-makers in identifying reform options. It addresses the following question: Which forms of providing and financing <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> work best in which situation? The framework 'disentangles' <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> by distinguishing between (1) governance structures, (2) capacity, (3) management, and (4) advisory methods. The framework suggests an impact chain approach to analyze the performance and impact of <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> and discusses theoretical and empirical research methods {{that can be used}} when applying the framework. The framework shows that reforms of <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> can combine different reform elements—such as decentralization, contracting out, using new advisory methods, and changing the management style—in different ways so as to best fit local circumstances. Using a New Institutional Economics approach (transaction costs approach), the article shows that the following sets of contextual factors need to be considered in this regard: the policy environment; the capacity of potential service providers; the type of production systems and market access of farm households; and the characteristics of local communities. The framework can be used to develop assessment tools for <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services,</b> to inform processes of reforming of <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> and to guide inter-disciplinary research. The framework is unique in combining the insights from different disciplines, which have, so far, been treated separately in the literature. The framework can help policy-makers and analysts to move from 'ideological' discussions on reform models to an evidence-based 'best fit' approach...|$|E

To classify pluralistic <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services,</b> the paper distinguishes between organizations from the public, the private and the third sector that can be involved in (a) providing and (b) financing of <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services.</b> The framework for analyzing pluralistic <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> presented in the paper addresses the need for analytical approaches that help policy-makers to identify those reform options that best fit country-specific frame conditions. Thus, the paper supports a shift from a “one-size-fits-all” to a “best fit” approach in the reform of public services [...] . Based on a review of the literature, the paper presents a variety of quantitative and qualitative methodological approaches derived from different disciplines that can be applied when using the framework in empirical research projects. The disciplines include agricultural and institutional economics, communication theory, adult education, and public administration and management.

40|$|The present article {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of local governance on <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> in Tajikistan. The Central Asian Republic of Tajikistan is an agricultural country that {{has been described as}} a hybrid state, where local governance tends to be dominated by a few powerful actors. Local governance processes do have a strong influence on the agriculture practise and on the exchange of the knowledge. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> claim various effects in the country. Especially in regions that are dominated by monocultures, advisory services have limited success. Therefore the present article assumes that the nexus of knowledge and innovation in Tajik agriculture is largely dependent on the decision-making of local governance processes. The article outlines the important role of local governance for distribution and use of knowledge in rural areas and emphasizes the context of <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>services</b> in Tajikistan.

25|$|In 1946, the National <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Service</b> {{was set up}} {{to supply}} {{agricultural}} advice and information. The Hill Farming Act of 1946 introduced for upland areas a system of grants for buildings, land improvement, and infrastructural improvements such as roads and electrification. The Act also continued a system of headage payments for hill sheep and cattle that had been introduced during the war. The Agricultural Holdings Act of 1948 enabled (in effect) tenant farmers to have lifelong tenancies and made provision for compensation in the event of cessations of tenancies. In addition, the Livestock Rearing Act of March 1951 extended the provisions of the 1946 Hill Farming Act to the upland store cattle and sheep sector.|$|R

The <b>advisory</b> <b>service</b> also promoted rural handicrafts. More local participation was needed from the beginning in all development efforts, such as reclamation, irrigation and drainage projects, to develop self reliance and initiative. There were great opportunities for rural development even on lands earlier classified unsuitable for commercial agriculture.
