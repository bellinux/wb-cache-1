5|$|Mail {{service was}} chaotic during the stampede. Apart {{from the number}} of prospectors, two major {{obstacles}} stood in its way. To begin with, any mail from America to Dawson City was sent to Juneau in South-east Alaska before being sent through Dawson and then down the Yukon to Circle City. From here it was then distributed by the US Post Office back up to Dawson. The huge distances involved resulted in delays of several months and frequently the loss of protective envelopes and their addresses. The second problem was in Dawson itself, which initially lacked a post office and therefore relied on two stores and a saloon to act as informal delivery points. The NWMP were tasked to run the mail system by October 1897, but they were ill-trained to do so. Up to 5,700 letters might arrive in <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>shipment,</b> all of which had to be collected in person from the post office. This resulted in huge queues, with claimants lining up outside the office for up to three days. Those who had no time and could afford it would pay others to stand in line for them, preferably a woman since they were allowed to get ahead in line out of politeness. Postage stamps, like paper in general, were scarce and rationed to two per customer. By 1899, trained postal staff took over mail delivery and relieved the NWMP of this task.|$|E

From customer perspective, merge-in-transit provides value since it facilitates the delivery of <b>a</b> <b>single</b> and consolidated <b>shipment</b> rather than multiple smaller shipments.

40|$|Abstract: Many tobacco {{cessation}} quitlines provide nicotine {{replacement therapy}} (NRT) in the U. S. but consensus is lacking regarding the best shipping protocol or NRT amounts. We evaluated {{the impact of}} the Minnesota QUITPLAN ® Helpline’s shift from distributing NRT using <b>a</b> <b>single</b> eight-week <b>shipment</b> to <b>a</b> two-shipment protocol. For this observational study, the eight week single-shipment cohort (n = 247) received eight weeks of NRT (patches or gum) at once, while the split-shipment cohort (n = 160) received five weeks of NRT (n = 94), followed by an additional three weeks of NRT if callers continued with counseling (n = 66). Patient satisfaction, retention, quit rates, and cost associated with the three groups were compared. A higher proportion of those receiving eight weeks of NRT, whether in one or two shipments, reported that the helpline was ―very helpful‖ (77. 2 % of the single-shipment group; 81. 1 % of the two-shipment group) than those receiving five weeks of NRT (57. 8 % of the one-shipment group) (p = 0. 004).

Two algorithms are applied for optimizing SSMD case: Gradient search and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms. Finally, numerical example and sensitivity analysis are provided to compare {{the total cost of}} the SSSD and SSMD cases and effectiveness of the considered algorithms.

50|$|A freight forwarder, forwarder, or {{forwarding}} agent, {{also known}} as a non-vessel operating common carrier (NVOCC), is a person or company that organizes shipments for individuals or corporations to get goods from the manufacturer or producer to a market, customer or final point of distribution. Forwarders contract with a carrier or often multiple carriers to move the goods. A forwarder does not move the goods but acts as an expert in the logistics network. These carriers can use a variety of shipping modes, including ships, airplanes, trucks, and railroads, and often multiple modes for <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>shipment.</b> For example, the freight forwarder may arrange to have cargo moved from a plant to an airport by truck, flown to the destination city, then moved from the airport to a customer's building by another truck.|$|E

5000|$|Transloading may be {{confused}} with transshipment, but in modern usage they represent different concepts. Transloading concerns the mechanics of transport, while transshipment is essentially a legal term addressing how the shipment originates and is destined. Consider a load of grain that is transloaded at an elevator, where it is combined with grain from other farms and thus leaves on the train as a distinct shipment from that in which it arrived. It thus cannot {{be said to be}} transshipped. Or consider a package shipped through a package delivery service or the mails: it may change shipping mode several times along the trip, but since it is (from an external point of view) conveyed as <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>shipment</b> regardless of how it is conveyed or what else travels with it on the legs of its journey, it is not considered to be transshipped. Conversely, a load on a truck can be taken in one (legal) shipment to an intermediate point and then to its ultimate destination without ever leaving the truck. If this is specified as two shipments, then the goods are transshipped, but no transloading has taken place.|$|E

Callers in the eight week two-shipment group completed significantly more calls (3. 0) than callers in the five week one-shipment group (2. 4) or eight week single-shipment group (1. 7) (p < 0. 001). Using both responder and intent-to-treat calculations, {{there were no significant differences}} in 30 -day point prevalence abstinence at seven months among the three protocol groups even when controlling for demographic and tobacco use characteristics, and treatment group protocol. The mean cost per caller was greater for the single-shipment phase than the split-shipment phase ($ 350 vs. $ 326) due to the savings associated with not sending a second shipment to some participants. Assuming no difference in abstinence rates resulting from the protocol change, cost-per-quit was lowest for the five week one-shipment group ($ 1, 155), and lower for the combined split-shipment cohort ($ 1, 242) than for the single-shipment cohort ($ 1, 350). Results of this evaluation indicate that while satisfaction rates increase among those receiving more counseling and NRT, quit rates do not, even when controlling for demographic and tobacco use characteristics...|$|R

Core of this vehicle is an electrically driven uniaxial transport unit, the “MicroCarrier”. It is designed for application both as part of a multiple trailer vehicle and as single electrically powered transport unit for hand-guided manoeuvre. An experimental vehicle of the transport system was built and tested. The next step intended is execution of field tests involving logistic companies and local governments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{scheduling}} problem {{addressed in this}} paper concerns a manufacturer who produces a variety of product types and operates in a make-to-order environment.

Instances of this problem occur across industries in manufacturing {{as well as in}} service environments. In this paper we show that the problem of minimizing the weighted sum of customer order delivery times is unary NP-hard. We characterize the optimal schedule, solve several special cases of the problem, derive tight lower bounds, and propose several heuristic solutions. We report the results of a set of computational experiments to evaluate the lower bounding procedures and the heuristics, and t...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a variety of}} scheduling, batching and delivery problems that arise in supply chain manufacturing.

A critical issue in supply chain scheduling is the coordination of decisions within the chain. The joint cost minimization problem that the supplier and manufacturer face if they collaborate is also considered.

40|$|A new, unmistakable {{vista of}} quality {{is taking place}} in the world. Consumers are {{increasingly}} basing their purchasing decisions on the quality of goods and services. They are even willing to pay more for the confidence and assurance of quality. This message is being received by producers, with mixed emotions. Quality apparently is still being treated casually by some manufacturers. Where quality has been at the fore front of management strategies, the sharper quality focus is an invited challenge. Dramatic progress is being made by companies which had the foresight to absorb the quality and productivity message and now continue to assertively transform quality commitment into action. These companies place sufficient emphasis on quality that with each shipment, or negotiation, consumer confidence is strengthened. There is good reason for this business strategy, decades of effort toward building a good company reputation can be negated by <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>shipment</b> of defective product...|$|E
