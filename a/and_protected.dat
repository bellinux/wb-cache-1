5|$|Although oxygen once {{promoted}} {{nitrogen fixation}} by making molybdenum available in water, it also directly poisons nitrogenase enzymes. Thus, in Earth's ancient history, after oxygen arrived {{in large quantities}} in Earth's air and water, organisms that continued to fix nitrogen in aerobic conditions isolated <b>and</b> <b>protected</b> their nitrogen-fixing enzymes from too much oxygen in heterocysts or equivalent structures. This structural isolation of nitrogen fixation reactions in aerobic organisms continues to the present.|$|E

5|$|Argentina {{abandoned}} {{the gold standard}} in December 1929, earlier than most countries. For much of the previous period, the country had operated a currency board, in which a body known as the caja de conversión was charged with maintaining the peso's value in gold. The devaluation of the peso increased the competitiveness of its exports <b>and</b> <b>protected</b> domestic production. Argentina saw {{the value of its}} exports drop from $1,537 million in 1929 to $561 million in 1932, but this was by no means the most severe downturn in the region.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was {{at peace with}} France and Spain and coastal defences {{received}} little attention. During the English Civil War of the 1640s, Calshot was held by Parliamentary forces against King Charles I, <b>and</b> <b>protected</b> with a 15-strong garrison at an annual cost of £107. Parliament considered the fortress important and kept it supplied with ammunition; unlike several other local forts, Parliament kept the castle operational, probably because of its ongoing role in defending Southampton Water. During the early 18th-century War of Spanish Succession it was equipped with up to 25 guns.|$|E
5|$|Large Danubian {{complexes}} were {{in recent}} years excavated in the Targowisko and Szarów (Wieliczka County) area of fertile loessial hills. The settlements, which included massive post construction houses even over 50 meters long as well as industrial facilities, extended continuously over a stretch of land more than three kilometers long. Some of the identified structures functioned together, {{as was the case}} when the buildings were connected by a courtyard <b>and</b> <b>protected</b> by a common fence.|$|E
