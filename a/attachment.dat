5|$|Boris and Zeanah (1999), {{have offered}} an {{approach}} to <b>attachment</b> disorders that considers cases where children have had no opportunity to form an <b>attachment,</b> those {{where there is a}} distorted relationship, and those where an existing <b>attachment</b> has been abruptly disrupted. This would significantly extend the definition beyond the ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR definitions because those definitions are limited to situations where the child has no <b>attachment</b> or no <b>attachment</b> to a specified <b>attachment</b> figure.|$|E
5|$|Four {{different}} <b>attachment</b> classifications {{have been}} identified in children: secure <b>attachment,</b> anxious-ambivalent <b>attachment,</b> anxious-avoidant <b>attachment,</b> and disorganized <b>attachment.</b> Secure <b>attachment</b> is when children feel they can rely on their caregivers to attend to their needs of proximity, emotional support and protection. It is considered to be the best <b>attachment</b> style. Anxious-ambivalent <b>attachment</b> is when the infant feels separation anxiety when separated from the caregiver and does not feel reassured when the caregiver returns to the infant. Anxious-avoidant <b>attachment</b> is when the infant avoids their parents. Disorganized <b>attachment</b> is when {{there is a lack of}} <b>attachment</b> behavior.|$|E

5|$|Within <b>attachment</b> theory, Bowlby, in <b>Attachment</b> and Loss, volume one of <b>Attachment</b> (1969), {{makes it}} quite clear that infants become {{attached}} to carers who are sensitive and responsive in their social interactions with them and that this {{does not have to}} be the mother or indeed a female. As a matter of social reality mothers are more often the primary carers of children and therefore are more likely to be the primary <b>attachment</b> figure, but the process of <b>attachment</b> applies to any carer and infants develop a number of attachments according to who relates to them and the intensity of the engagement. However, <b>attachment</b> theory relates to the development of <b>attachment</b> behaviours and relationships after about 7 months of age and there are other theories and research relating to earlier carer–infant interactions.|$|E
5|$|According to the AACAP Practice Parameter (2005) the {{question}} of whether <b>attachment</b> disorders can reliably be diagnosed in older children and adults has not been resolved. <b>Attachment</b> behaviors used for the diagnosis of RAD change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors in older children is difficult. There are no substantially validated measures of <b>attachment</b> in middle childhood or early adolescence. Assessments of RAD past school age may not be possible at all as by this time children have developed along individual lines {{to such an extent that}} early <b>attachment</b> experiences are only one factor among many that determine emotion and behavior.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} {{a wide range of}} <b>attachment</b> {{difficulties}} within the styles which may result in emotional disturbance and increase the risk of later psychopathologies, particularly the disorganized style, none of the styles constitute a disorder in themselves and none equate to criteria for RAD as such. A disorder in the clinical sense is a condition requiring treatment, as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. Reactive <b>attachment</b> disorder denotes a lack of typical <b>attachment</b> behaviors rather than an <b>attachment</b> style, however problematic that style may be, in that there is an unusual lack of discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar people in both forms of the disorder. Such discrimination does exist as a feature of the social behavior of children with atypical <b>attachment</b> styles. Both DSM-IV and ICD-10 depict the disorder in terms of socially aberrant behavior in general rather than focusing more specifically on <b>attachment</b> behaviors as such. DSM-IV emphasizes a failure to initiate or respond to social interactions across a range of relationships and ICD-10 similarly focuses on contradictory or ambivalent social responses that extend across social situations. The relationship between patterns of <b>attachment</b> in the Strange Situation and RAD is not yet clear.|$|E

5|$|Another {{issue is}} the role of {{inherited}} genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example one type of polymorphism of the gene coding for the D2 dopamine receptor has been linked to anxious <b>attachment</b> and another in the gene for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor with avoidant <b>attachment.</b> This suggests that the influence of maternal care on <b>attachment</b> security is not the same for all children. One theoretical basis for this is that it makes biological sense for children to vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence.|$|E
5|$|As <b>attachment</b> theory {{offers a}} broad, {{far-reaching}} {{view of human}} functioning, it can enrich a therapist's understanding of patients and the therapeutic relationship rather than dictate a particular form of treatment. Some forms of psychoanalysis-based therapy for adults—within relational psychoanalysis and other approaches—also incorporate <b>attachment</b> theory and patterns. In {{the first decade of}} the 21st century, key concepts of <b>attachment</b> were incorporated into existing models of behavioural couple therapy, multidimensional family therapy and couple and family therapy. Specifically attachment-centred interventions have been developed, such as attachment-based family therapy and emotionally focused therapy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Attachment</b> {{theory has}} {{implications}} in residence and contact disputes, and applications by foster parents to adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis. Increasingly <b>attachment</b> theory has replaced it, thus {{focusing on the}} quality and continuity of caregiver relationships rather than economic well-being or automatic precedence of any one party, such as the biological mother. Rutter noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of <b>attachment</b> relationships. Children tend to have <b>attachment</b> relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives. Judgements need to take this into account along {{with the impact of}} step-families. <b>Attachment</b> theory has been crucial in highlighting the importance of social relationships in dynamic rather than fixed terms.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We studied {{post-mortem}} 9 nonsmokers' {{lungs and}} 9 smokers' lungs {{as well as}} 14 surgical smokers' lungs to examine the possible relationship {{of the number of}} alveolar <b>attachments</b> with airways inflammation and with lung function. Alveolar <b>attachments</b> are the alveolar walls radially attached to the small airways, and any discontinuity or rupture of these alveolar walls was considered abnormal. Normal and abnormal <b>attachments</b> were counted in nonsmokers and smokers and expressed as number of <b>attachments,</b> distance between <b>attachments,</b> and percentage of abnormal <b>attachments.</b> Although internal small airways diameter and mean linear intercept were not significantly different between smokers of either group and nonsmokers, significant differences in number of <b>attachments</b> (p less than 0. 001), distance between <b>attachments</b> (p less than 0. 01), and percentage of abnormal <b>attachments</b> (p less than 0. 01) were found. The 3 indexes of alveolar <b>attachments</b> correlated significantly with the score for airways inflammation and with the elastic recoil pressure in smokers. No significant correlation with any other lung function test was found. We conclude that smokers have fewer alveolar <b>attachments</b> than do nonsmokers, and that the loss of alveolar <b>attachments</b> represents an early stage in the destruction of lung parenchyma, and is probably linked to inflammation of the small airways. Because of the strategic situation of this lesion, it could be responsible in part for the loss of elastic recoil seen in the initial stages of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease...|$|R

5|$|<b>Attachment</b> {{theory was}} {{extended}} to adult romantic relationships in the late 1980s by Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver.

These roughly correspond to infant classifications: secure, insecure-ambivalent, insecure-avoidant and disorganized/disoriented.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1970, {{a series}} of {{expansions}} were added to Ainsworth's original patterns. They include the following: B4 (1970), A/C (1985) D/disorganized (1986), B5 (1988, 1992) A+, C+, & Depressed (1992, 2010). At later ages, additional categories have been described. Each of these patterns reflects {{a different kind of}} <b>attachment</b> relationship of the infant with the mother/caregiver. An infant may have a different pattern of <b>attachment</b> to each parent as well as to alternate caregivers. Pattern of <b>attachment</b> is thus {{not a part of the}} infant, but is characteristic of the protective and comforting quality of a specific relationship. These <b>attachment</b> patterns are associated with behavioral patterns and can help further predict a child's future personality.|$|E
5|$|Belief in {{prenatal}} fetal awareness, mental {{communication between}} mother and unborn child, and emotional <b>attachment</b> of child to mother as a prenatal phenomenon, are concepts that connect easily to the unfounded assumption that all adopted children suffer emotional disorders. These beliefs are also congruent with CAM psychotherapies such as <b>attachment</b> therapy (not based on <b>attachment</b> theory), which purport to bring about age regression and to recapitulate early development to produce a better outcome.|$|E
40|$|Chromosome bi-orientation occurs after {{conversion}} of initial lateral <b>attachments</b> between kinetochores and spindle microtubules into stable end-on <b>attachments</b> near the cell equator. After bi-orientation, chromosomes experience tension from spindle forces, which {{plays a key}} role in the stabilization of correct kinetochore-microtubule <b>attachments.</b> However, how end-on kinetochore-microtubule <b>attachments</b> are first stabilized in the absence of tension remains a key unanswered question. To address this, we generated Drosophila S 2 cells undergoing mitosis with unreplicated genomes (SMUGs). SMUGs retained single condensed chromatids that attached laterally to spindle microtubules. Over time, laterally attached kinetochores converted into end-on <b>attachments</b> and experienced intra-kinetochore stretch/structural deformation, and SMUGs eventually exited a delayed mitosis with mono-oriented chromosomes after satisfying the spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC). Polar ejection forces (PEFs) generated by Chromokinesins promoted the conversion from lateral to end-on kinetochore-microtubule <b>attachments</b> that satisfied the SAC in SMUGs. Thus, PEFs convert lateral to stable end-on kinetochore-microtubule <b>attachments,</b> independently of chromosome bi-orientation...|$|R

5|$|Certain {{types of}} {{learning}} are possible, respective to each applicable type of learning, only within a limited age range {{known as a}} critical period. Bowlby's concepts included the idea that <b>attachment</b> involved learning from experience during a limited age period, influenced by adult behaviour. He did not apply the imprinting concept in its entirety to human <b>attachment.</b> However, he considered that <b>attachment</b> behaviour was best explained as instinctive, combined with the effect of experience, stressing the readiness the child brings to social interactions. Over time it became apparent there were more differences than similarities between <b>attachment</b> theory and imprinting so the analogy was dropped.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Laplace {{transform}} is used {{to obtain}} a solution for a Timoshenko beam on an elastic founda-tion with several combinations of discrete in-span <b>attachments</b> and with several combinations of <b>attachments</b> at the boundaries. These <b>attachments</b> include translation and torsion springs, masses, and undamped single degree-of-freedom systems. The Laplace transform technique, which apparently has not been used previously to solve for the eigenvalues of coupled systems of equations, produces a solution in which the boundary con-ditions can be considered independently of the number and type of in-span <b>attachments.</b> Taking advantage of this independence, many specific combinations of in-span <b>attachments</b> and boundary <b>attachments</b> are exam-ined. It is shown that the Laplace transform method removes some of the drawbacks {{of the most frequently}} used methods used to solve Timoshenko beams with in-span attachments: beam partitioning, Green’s func-tions, and Lagrange multipliers. Excellent agreement is found upon comparing previously reported results {{for a wide range of}} boundary conditions and <b>attachments.</b> In addition, several sets of new results are given...|$|R

40|$|Proper cell {{division}} relies on equal distribution of sister chromatids over daughter cells. This process is executed by a bipolar mitotic spindle, which via microtubule plus ends connects kinetochores of both sister chromatids to opposite poles. Various control systems {{have evolved to}} ensure equal segregation, such as destabilization of erroneous kinetochore-microtubule <b>attachments.</b> How these destabilizing actions are eventually repressed to allow for establishment of correct <b>attachments</b> {{has not yet been}} completely elucidated. Here, I will discuss a model that explains how destabilization of kinetochore-microtubule <b>attachments</b> can be overcome. In this model, <b>attachments</b> of kinetochores to the sides of microtubules play a crucial role.

5|$|In {{addition}} to longitudinal studies, {{there has been}} psychophysiological research on the biology of <b>attachment.</b> Research has begun to include neural development, behaviour genetics and temperament concepts. Generally, temperament and <b>attachment</b> constitute separate developmental domains, but aspects of both contribute {{to a range of}} interpersonal and intrapersonal developmental outcomes. Some types of temperament may make some individuals susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years. In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that some children are particularly vulnerable to developing <b>attachment</b> disorders.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{standardized}} diagnosis system, many popular, informal classification systems or checklists, outside the DSM and ICD, were created out of clinical and parental experience within the field known as <b>attachment</b> therapy. These lists are unvalidated and critics state they are inaccurate, too broadly defined or applied by unqualified persons. Many are found on the websites of <b>attachment</b> therapists. Common elements of these lists such as lying, lack of remorse or conscience and cruelty do not form part of the diagnostic criteria under either DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10. Many children are being diagnosed with RAD because of behavioral problems that are outside the criteria. There is an emphasis within <b>attachment</b> therapy on aggressive behavior as a symptom of what they describe as <b>attachment</b> disorder whereas mainstream theorists view these behaviors as comorbid, externalizing behaviors requiring appropriate assessment and treatment rather than <b>attachment</b> disorders. However, knowledge of <b>attachment</b> relationships can contribute to the cause, maintenance and treatment of externalizing disorders.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of officially {{recognized}} diagnostic criteria, and beyond the ambit of the discourse on a broader set of criteria discussed above, the term <b>attachment</b> disorder has been increasingly used by some clinicians {{to refer to a}} broader set of children whose behavior may be affected by lack of a primary <b>attachment</b> figure, a seriously unhealthy <b>attachment</b> relationship with a primary caregiver, or a disrupted <b>attachment</b> relationship. Although there are no studies examining diagnostic accuracy, concern is expressed as to the potential for over-diagnosis based on broad checklists and 'snapshots'. This form of therapy, including diagnosis and accompanying parenting techniques, is scientifically unvalidated and is not considered to be part of mainstream psychology or, despite its name, to be based on <b>attachment</b> theory, with which it is considered incompatible. It has been described as potentially abusive and a pseudoscientific intervention, that has resulted in tragic outcomes for children.|$|E
