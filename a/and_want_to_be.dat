5|$|Elizabeth's case {{is brought}} to trial the {{following}} morning, {{with the assistance of}} the cobbler Richard Two-Shoes (Kaye). Elizabeth's daughter Sarah (Matthews) and son-in-law Thomas Nutter (Howick) testify that they have witnessed Elizabeth sucking from the teat of a furry creature, and speaking to a mouse (believed to be a demon). Elizabeth claims that Sarah and Thomas have falsely accused her, <b>and</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rid of her to make room in their house. George Waterhouse (Cooper) testifies against Elizabeth, and the accused is questioned. When others in the courtroom begin laughing at her responses, Warren declares that the next person to laugh will be executed as a witch. After an argument breaks out, the witch-finders and Pike decide that the rest of the trial should be conducted in private. Elizabeth is pricked with a needle to test her for the devil's mark. A remorseful Sarah tries to profess her mother's innocence, but Warren does not believe her. Elizabeth confesses that she has been prostituting herself to Two-Shoes, who wears a fur coat, but Two-Shoes denies this, and the trial is adjourned. Throughout proceedings, Warren is accusatory while Clarke is more cautious; Pike, meanwhile, is fascinated both by the lewd acts in which Elizabeth has supposedly engaged and by the witch-finders' torturous implements.|$|E

500|$|Describing {{the tone}} of the episode Ford {{describes}} it as [...] "an all out romp" [...] and an [...] "action, rollercoaster ride" [...] with [...] "a lot of comedy in it as much as thrills and nasty monsters". Davies stated that [...] "the whole point of the episode is to have a right old laugh". Expanding on the comedic aspects, something Ford considered whilst writing the episode was that [...] "the trick is to have the comedy come out of the characters" [...] rather than the scenario itself. It was Eve Myles' idea to have Gwen compulsively eat gherkins after waking up pregnant; the script had only specified the character drinking a glass of water. The episode also plays on Gwen's conflicted feelings between Jack and Rhys. Davies felt it would be [...] "irresistible" [...] to have the wedding temporarily halted by [...] "the one man Rhys doesn't want to see running down the aisle." [...] Ford stated that whilst Jack is [...] "the series hero" [...] Rhys is [...] "the hero of this episode". He compares a sequence where Rhys arms himself with a chainsaw to defend Gwen to the character being in [...] "Evil Dead mode". [...] Producer Richard Stokes commented that the episode illuminated that [...] "even though 's put [...] through some really difficult times, she really does love him <b>and</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> with him." [...] In an early draft of the script Gwen and Rhys had their memories wiped {{at the end of the}} episode in addition to the other guests and were convinced by Jack that the wedding had been problem free.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2008, {{the young}} boxer chose to leave Enzo Calzaghe's Newbridge boxing club {{where he had}} trained {{throughout}} his career and begin training at his father's gym in South Wales. [...] Speaking about his decision to leave the gym Cleverly said [...] "I have been trained by Enzo Calzaghe for six years since my youth days so leaving him {{has been one of}} the hardest decision I've ever had to make... Enzo is largely responsible for where I am in my career and I cannot thank him enough for what he has done for me." [...] Cleverly had been concerned following the legal wranglings between promoter Frank Warren and his former stablemate Joe Calzaghe and added [...] "I cannot take any chances with my career...

2500|$|Shatner {{has been}} a friend of actress Heather Locklear since 1982, when she began co-starring with him on T. J. Hooker. As she was also {{appearing}} in a semi-regular role in another Aaron Spelling production, Dynasty, Locklear was asked by Entertainment Tonight whether this schedule was difficult. She replied [...] "I'd get really nervous <b>and</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> prepared" [...] for Shatner and for the experienced cast of Dynasty. After T.J. Hooker ended, Shatner helped Locklear get other roles. Locklear supported a grieving Shatner in 1999 when he was mourning {{the death of his}} wife Nerine. In 2005, Locklear appeared in two episodes of Shatner's Boston Legal as Kelly Nolan, a woman being tried for killing her much older, wealthy husband. Shatner's character is attracted to Nolan and tries to insert himself into her defense. Locklear was asked how she came to appear on Boston Legal. She explained [...] "I love the show, it's my favorite show; and I sorta kind of said, 'Shouldn't I be William Shatner's illegitimate daughter, or his love interest?'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Genco Russo's once {{described}} {{his role in}} the community to the social activist Danilo Dolci. It provides an illustration of the self-image of the mafioso in the second, [...] "legitimate" [...] stage of his career - the mafioso as a public benefactor rather than as a dangerous criminal: [...] "It's in my nature. I have no ulterior motives. If I can do a man a favour, no matter who he is, I will; because that's how I'm made... I can't say 'no' to anyone. The trouble I'm put to is not so great that I have to refuse people in need... Very often warm-heartedness will win a man gratitude and friendship, and then the time comes to ask for one thing or another in... Folks come and ask how they should vote because they feel the need for advice. They want to show that they are grateful to those who have worked for their good; they want to thank them for what they've done by voting for them; but they are ignorant, <b>and</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> told how to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{they got}} their start as a visual kei band, the members of Dir en Grey seem to be irked being {{associated}} with the term in some interviews. Speaking {{of the change in}} their appearance, Kaoru said [...] "Eventually, we felt that dressing like we used to onstage put up a wall between us and the audience, so we stopped wearing the kind of makeup we did before." [...] However, he said they still occasionally wear makeup, just not as much. Toshiya explained [...] "To be honest, when we first started and we were wearing a lot of makeup on stage and stuff, {{there were a lot of}} bands doing that at the time in Japan, and people thought it was cool. But not anymore, ha ha." [...] Die said [...] "They saw us as idols but we aren't idols. We are a band, we play music <b>and</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> known for it. So we decided to change our style slowly." [...] Kyo stated that for Dir en Grey it was always about the music and when wearing lots of makeup became popular, [...] "we didn't want to be associated with a lot of the poor quality bands in that scene." ...|$|E
