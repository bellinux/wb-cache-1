60|$|Since {{then the}} centuries in England have {{achieved}} something different; and something which, fortunately, is perfectly easy to state. There {{is no doubt}} about what we have done. We have kept the inequality, but we have destroyed the security. The man is not tied to the land, as in serfdom; nor is the land tied to the man, as in a peasantry. The rich man has entered into an <b>absolute</b> <b>ownership</b> of farms and fields; and (in the modern industrial phrase) he has locked out the English people. They can only find an acre to dig or a house to sleep in by accepting such competitive and cruel terms as he chooses to impose.|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{first the}} natives had sold their land willingly, {{but as the}} number of the European {{settlers}} increased they became jealous of them, and every obstacle was thrown in the way of land sales by the chiefs. Disputes were constantly arising owing {{to the fact that the}} <b>absolute</b> <b>ownership</b> of land was very ill defined, and perhaps a dozen or more persons professed to have claims of some sort or other on each piece of land, and had to be individually settled with before the sale could be effected. When as it seemed all was satisfactorily concluded, fresh claimants would arise, and disputes were therefore of constant occurrence, for there were no authorities outside the principal settlements to enforce obedience to the law.|$|E
60|$|The {{policy of}} the bill as tersely {{explained}} by Mr. Gladstone {{in a letter to}} Manning, compressing as he said eight or ten columns of the Times, was “to prevent the landlord from using the terrible weapon of undue and unjust eviction, by so framing the handle that it shall cut his hands with the sharp edge of pecuniary damages. The man evicted without any fault, and suffering the usual loss by it, will receive whatever the custom of the country gives, and where there is no custom, according to a scale, besides whatever he can claim for permanent buildings or reclamation of land. Wanton eviction will, as I hope, be extinguished by provisions like these. And if they extinguish wanton eviction, they will also extinguish those demands for unjust augmentations of rent, which are only formidable to the occupier, because the power of wanton or arbitrary eviction is behind them.” What seems so simple, and what was so necessary, marked in truth a vast revolutionary stride. It transferred to the tenant a portion of the <b>absolute</b> <b>ownership,</b> and gave him something like an estate in his holding. The statute contained a whole code of minor provisions, including the extension of Mr. Bright’s clauses for peasant proprietorship in the Church Act, but this transfer was what gave the Act its place in solid legal form.|$|E
50|$|The {{reduction}} of taxes meant keeping {{a larger share}} of the local surplus crop production. In consequence, regardless of the theoretical framework that governed the land ownership and political regime of the Ottoman Empire, the lands of Metsovo were gradually falling under the <b>absolute</b> possession, <b>ownership,</b> and management of its residents, which corresponded to political self-governance. This development had a cost. Every year, the corresponding taxes and other contributions had to be pre-paid to the Ottoman landlord of the area, otherwise the Chora or Mukataa of Metsovo could lose its status and be combined with neighboring Ottoman regions.|$|R

Chattel slavery is a type of slavery defined as the <b>absolute</b> legal <b>ownership</b> of a person or persons, including the legal right to buy and sell them. The slaves do not have the freedom to live life as they choose, but as they are instructed by their owners, and their rights may be either severely limited or nonexistent. In most countries, chattel slaves were considered as movable property.|$|R

50|$|The king's {{right to}} tax was the logical next step after the theory of <b>absolute</b> <b>ownership</b> of lands by the king. Manu {{describes}} the king as the absolute lord {{of the land and}} as such, the king was entitled to his share in the produce of the lands. The permission of the king was needed to buy, sell and donate land. In reality, the land was the people’s own, with the king only claiming <b>absolute</b> <b>ownership.</b> As long as the people worked the land and paid their taxes, they would be fine, but otherwise, the king could exercise his power and confiscate the land.|$|E
40|$|Although cases {{decided in}} other colonial jurisdictions before Mabo and Others v State of Queensland (No 2) had {{recognised}} the Crown's 'radical title', {{the meaning of}} the term was not definitively explained. Consequently, it was possible for the majority judges in Mabo to attribute a meaning of something less than <b>absolute</b> beneficial <b>ownership</b> to the term, while the sole dissenting judge attributed a meaning of nothing less than <b>absolute</b> beneficial <b>ownership</b> to the term. Nevertheless, post-Mabo, it has generally been assumed that Crown's 'radical title' connotes a full and unfettered proprietary right except to the extent of native title, This two-part article shows, however, that this assumption fails to appreciate the significance of the historical meaning of radical tit/e [...] It is argued that, as a legal concept, radical title is a bare legal title which does not automatically confer beneficial ownership of the land to which it relates. Part 1 explains that, contrary to the received view, the leading Privy Council authorities {{on the nature of the}} Crown's title to land which is subject to pre-existing title are not authority for the proposition that the Crown has a present proprietary estate underlying the pre-existing title, nor the proposition that the Crown's radical title is necessarily a full and present proprietary estate in respect of land not subject to pre-existing rights. It is also shown, by reference to American authority, that the reason for concluding that the Crown holds the unalienated and unoccupied lands of a settled colony in demesne is the confusion of international law and municipal law, sovereignty and property...|$|R

50|$|During the Soviet era, {{agriculture}} {{was characterized}} by <b>absolute</b> state <b>ownership</b> of all agricultural land and concentration of production in large-scale collective farms, which averaged 428 hectares in size. When Georgia became independent after {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union at the end of 1991, the entire country was in total disarray facing a bitter civil war. Georgian agriculture collapsed, and the land held by large collective farms was quickly distributed to rural households in an attempt to avoid famine. This desperate goal was achieved as Georgian agriculture quickly recovered in 1993-95. The recovery raised the volume of agricultural production in recent years by 25%-30% above its lowest level in 1993, yet the initial collapse was so dramatic that agricultural output in 2006 was still 40% below what it was in 1990.|$|R

40|$|This article reports field {{research}} on Papua New Guinea's land courts, which decide property disputes in customary law. Customary law did not contemplate exchange of real property outside the kin group.

40|$|This article {{argues that}} the feudal {{doctrine}} of tenure continues to endure {{as the foundation for}} Australian land law despite its obvious social and historical irrelevance. The doctrine of tenure is a derivation of feudal history. The article examines some of its historical foundations with the aim of highlighting the disparity between the fiction of this inherited form and the reality of a colonial Australian landscape. Particular attention is given to the fact that Australian feudal tenure was always a passive framework. It was disconnected with the landscape and therefore incapable of responding to the needs of colonial expansion. This resulted in a clear disparity between feudal form and the reality of a land system populated by statutory grants. The article argues that feudal tenure was never truly devised as a responsive land system but rather, adopted as a sovereignty device. In this sense, legal history was utilised with the aim of promoting imperial objectives within colonial Australia. Tenure was equated with <b>absolute</b> Crown <b>ownership</b> over all Australian territory despite {{the fact that this was}} inconsistent with the orthodox tenets of feudal tenure. The article {{argues that the}} consequence of adopting feudal tenure and <b>absolute</b> Crown <b>ownership</b> has been the estrangement of indigenous rights, title and culture. The creation and legitimisation of a land framework with a fundamentally Eurocentric perspective completely destroyed indigenous interests during the settlement and colonial era. It created an imperial ideology where colonists silently accepted the denial of indigenous identity. The decision of the Mabo High Court to reassess this historical perspective and accept the validity of proven native title claims clearly disturbed tenurial assumptions. However, the High Courts 2 ̆ 7 reification of the feudal form created a fundamental paradox: indigenous title was accepted as a proprietary right within a framework incapable of and unequipped to recognise the fundamentally different cultural perspectives of customary ownership. The article argues that native title cannot evolve within a common law framework that regards ownership as a derivation of the English Crown. It is suggested that ultimately, a pluralist property culture, where indigenous and non-indigenous title exist as equalised entities, can only be properly nurtured with the full and absolute abolition of the feudal doctrine of tenure. <br /...|$|R
60|$|It is {{here that}} the Communist regime in Russia has {{encountered}} its most fatal difficulty. A catastrophic unqualified abolition of private property has necessarily resulted in all the paper, all the printing machinery, all the libraries, all the news-stalls and book shops, becoming Government property. It is impossible to print anything {{without the consent of}} the Government. One cannot buy a book or newspaper; one must take what the Government distributes. Free discussion--never a very free thing in Russia--has now on any general scale become quite impossible. It was a difficulty foreseen long ago in Socialist discussions, but never completely met by the thorough-paced Communist. At one blow the active mental life of Russia has been ended, and so long as Russia remains completely and consistently communist it cannot be resumed.

Although large agricultural landlords belonged to the Govigama caste, many now may not own land. Most Goyigama were however ordinary farmers and tenants as <b>absolute</b> land <b>ownership</b> was exclusive to the king until the British colonial period. In addition to the Govigama, there were several strata of occupational castes. Wahumpura or Deva were the caste who traditionally made jaggery and farmed. The Bathgama caste was also engaged in agriculture with access to some land. The Navandanna (Achari) caste were artisans. The Rada were washers, and this caste is still prevalent in Sri Lanka's laundry sector. The Berava were traditional drummers and agricultural wage laborers. The Kinnara caste did menial work and were segregated {{from the rest of}} the community. The most important feature of the Kandyan system was Rajakariya ("the king's work"), which linked each caste to an occupation and demanded service to the court and religious institutions.|$|R
