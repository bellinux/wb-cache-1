40|$|During {{the last}} decade we have {{witnessed}} many developments in networking. Among others, wireless network technologies have become an important and constantly growing part of the Internet infrastructure, and increasingly smaller and more powerful computing devices with flexible connectivity have enabled many new services and applications. The EUNICE 2007 theme, ‘Dependable and <b>Adaptable</b> <b>Networks</b> and Services,’ has been inspired by these developments, and aims at addressing the follow-up challenges. One of the main challenges {{in the next decade}} will be to make the Internet and the services that are provided on top of it more dependable and adaptable. Research on this theme is needed for fixed, wireless and ad-hoc networking, ubiquitous communication and computing, sensor networks, and context-awareness. While individual mobile applications with context-aware and personalized features emerged, at the same time many issues in network and service architectures arose concerning integration, interoperability, management, provisioning, reliability and security. On the one hand research has to make available a sound understanding of these applications and their supporting service and network architectures. On the other hand, research should produce service and network infrastructure solutions to be able to provide the necessary quality of service for the envisioned applications. This book, containing the papers accepted for presentation at EUNICE 2007, presents some of the research related to the challenge of dependable and <b>adaptable</b> <b>networks</b> and services...|$|R
3000|$|Motivated by {{the above}} example, we {{strongly}} advocate the channel width <b>adaptable</b> <b>network</b> architecture. Briefly speaking, {{the advantages of}} channel width adaptation are two-fold. On one hand, we can distribute the traffic as evenly as possible across the spectrum in a fine granularity to achieve channel load balance. On the other hand, in a scenario with many interfering links, by [...] "creating" [...] more small-width orthogonal channels, we can greatly reduce the phenomena of contention and collision, and therefore improve throughput {{as a result of}} fewer back-offs and reduced interference. Another motivation for the channel width <b>adaptable</b> <b>network</b> architecture is the recent open spectrum effort [7] made by the spectrum regulation authority such as FCC. Because of the variable widths of [...] "white space" [...] unoccupied by licensed users, we believe channel width adaptation will {{become one of the most}} important functions for cognitive radio networks in future open spectrum environment.|$|E

40|$|We present {{reliability}} {{solutions for}} <b>adaptable</b> <b>Network</b> RAM systems running on general-purpose clusters. Network RAM allows nodes with over-committed memory to swap pages over the network, storing {{them in the}} idle RAM of other nodes and avoiding swapping to slow, local disk. An <b>adaptable</b> <b>Network</b> RAM system adjusts the amount of RAM currently available for storing remotely swapped pages in response to changes in nodes’ local RAM usage. It is important that Network RAM systems provide reliability for remotely swapped page data. Without reliability, a single node failure can result in failure of unrelated processes running on other nodes by losing their remotely swapped pages. <b>Adaptable</b> <b>Network</b> RAM systems pose extra difficulties in providing reliability because each node’s capacity for storing remotely swapped pages changes over time, and because pages may move from node to node {{in response to these}} changes. Our novel dynamic RAID-based reliability solutions use idle RAM for storing page and reliability data, avoiding using slow disk for reliability. They are designed to work with the adaptive nature of our Network RAM system (Nswap), allowing page and reliability data to migrate from node to node and allowing pages to be added to or removed from different parity groups. Additionally, page recovery runs concurrently with cluster applications, so that cluster applications do not have to wait until all data from a failed node is recovered before resuming execution. We present results comparing Nswap to disk swapping for a set of benchmarks running on our gigabit cluster. Our results show that reliable Nswap is up to 32 times faster than swapping to disk, and that there is virtually no impact on the performance of applications as they run concurrently with page recovery...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{aimed to}} expand upon the {{chemistry}} and potential applications of covalent <b>adaptable</b> <b>networks</b> (CANs), focusing on {{three types of}} reversible reactions: Diels-Alder, transesterification, and thiol-thioester exchange. The thermoreversible Diels-Alder (DA) reaction was synergistically combined with two other polymerization types to create novel hybrid materials. In the first aspect, a second-stage acrylate photopolymerization was used to 2 ̆ 2 fix 2 ̆ 2 the DA network in a spatially controlled manner. During light exposure, {{a sharp increase in}} acrylate conversion and a 60 °C jump in the polymer glass transition temperature were observed. More importantly, the network could no longer be depolymerized into a soluble material by the retro-DA reaction. This dual-cure network polymer was applied as a solid-state photoresist to create 3 D microstructures. In the second aspect, DA and polyurethane polymerizations were performed simultaneously to form a pseudo-interpenetrating network structure. The two thermally-driven reactions were shown to be orthogonal by real-time FTIR studies. Coatings of the hybrid polymer were repeatedly damaged and healed, as confirmed by tensile fracture testing and electrochemical conductivity experiments, while retaining their overall shape, in contrast to pure DA networks. In addition, two types of exchange-based covalent <b>adaptable</b> <b>networks</b> (CANs) were studied in the context of thiol-ene “click” polymerizations. The transesterification reaction was implemented in a photocurable thiol-ene polymer network. Between 145 and 175 °C, a strong Arrhenius dependence of the characteristic relaxation time with temperature was observed, which provided confirmation that the material behaved as a vitrimer. Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) was performed at 175 °C to create optically active, yet reversible nanoscale topologies. Micro-scale photopatterning was also applied in combination with NIL to create hierarchical, mixed-scale patterns. Finally, the thiol-thioester exchange reaction was demonstrated for ambient temperature CANs with unprecedented ambient temperature exchange kinetics. These crosslinked polymers were shown to undergo significant creep and stress relaxation at ambient temperature, provided that free thiol, base, and thioesters were all present. Up to 90...|$|R
