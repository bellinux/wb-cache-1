Health care providers use otoscopes to screen for illness during regular check-ups and also to investigate ear symptoms. An otoscope potentially gives a view of the ear canal and tympanic membrane or eardrum. Because the eardrum is the border separating the external ear canal from the middle ear, its characteristics can be indicative of various diseases of the middle ear space. The presence of cerumen (ear wax), shed skin, pus, canal skin edema, foreign body, and various ear diseases can obscure any view of the eardrum and thus severely compromise the value of otoscopy done with a common otoscope. [...] The most commonly used otoscopes consist of a handle and a head. The head contains a light source and a simple low-power magnifying lens, typically around 8 diopters (3.00x Mag). The distal (front) end of the otoscope has an attachment for disposable plastic ear specula. The examiner first straightens the ear canal by pulling on the pinna and then inserts the ear speculum side of the otoscope into the external ear. It is important to brace the hand holding the otoscope against the patient's head to avoid injury to the ear canal by placing the index finger or little finger against the head. The examiner can then look through a lens on the rear of the instrument and see inside the ear canal. In many models, the lens can be removed, which allows the examiner to insert instruments through the otoscope into the ear canal, such as for removing earwax (cerumen). Most models also have an insertion point for a bulb capable of pushing air through the speculum which is called pneumatic otoscope. This puff of air allows an examiner to test the mobility of the tympanic membrane.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{describe}} the organisms cultured from general practitioners' <b>auriscope</b> earpieces; {{and to explore}} general practitioners' perceptions {{of the possibility of}} cross infection from contaminated <b>auriscope</b> earpieces and of how their <b>auriscope</b> earpieces are cleaned. DESIGN [...] Microbiological survey of <b>auriscope</b> earpieces in two general practices and a semistructured questionnaire sent to 105 general practitioners. SETTING [...] General practitioners served by one district general hospital microbiology laboratory in the north of England. RESULTS [...] Organisms were cultured from 41 (93 %) of 44 <b>auriscope</b> earpieces, of which 14 (32 %) carried potential pathogens; four (9 %) were heavily contaminated. Of the 85 (81 %) general practitioners who responded, 72 (85 %) believed that contaminated <b>auriscope</b> earpieces could cause serious infection, 66 (78 %) did not clean earpieces between patients, and 70 (82 %) thought that patients would mind if they knew that dirty earpieces were used. CONCLUSIONS [...] Almost a third of <b>auriscope</b> earpieces were contaminated by pathogenic bacteria. Although general practitioners suspected this, most did not ensure that a clean earpiece was used for each patient...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Otoscopic {{examination}} can {{be carried}} out by using four main methods. These include otoscopic examinations made with head mirror, <b>auriscope,</b> otomicroscope and video-endoscope. We aimed to compare four otoscopic examination methods with respect to their accuracies in identification of pathologies and normal structures in external ear canal and tympanic membrane. Methods: Our study involved 99 patients and their 151 ears. According to the gold standard parameters, we calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of the otoscopic examination methods in determining otoscopic diagnostic parameters. Results: in determining 16 main and 77 sub-parameters which were in otoscopic examination form with four different methods, although head mirror method was insufficient in...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} the illumination of optical instruments such as microscopes or auriscopes {{by means of the}} light from light-emitting diodes (L. E. D.) (6, 50). Advantageously, the light from the diodes may be strobed. Examples described include the positioning of L. E. D. 's (6) at {{the focal point of the}} inverted condenser lens (2) of a microscope, and the inclusion of a plurality of L. E. D. 's (50) in the probe portion (38) of an <b>auriscope.</b> In the latter case, the device may also be provided with a source of frequency-controlled sound (28) channelled through the probe portion (38).

40|$|We {{agree with}} Dr Hughes's {{advocacy}} of using mainly clinical parameters for treatment control, and that 17 -OHP estimations have brought {{an improvement in}} monitoring CAH patients. The correlation of testosterone with 17 -OHP levels is well known but as testosterone is less sensitive {{it can only be}} a rough guide to inadequate CAH control. Perhaps a longitudinal study, possibly with several centres taking part, could evaluate the various regimens. Proctoscopy in infancy with reference to its use in necrotising enterocolitis Sir, I read with interest the paper by Fenton et al., 1 but wondered why they changed the spelling of the word 'auriscope ' which is derived from the Latin auris-ear; thus an <b>auriscope</b> is an instrument designed for examining ears (Medical Dictionary: Faber). According to the Oxford Dictionary an 'auroscope ' therefore is an instru-ment designed either for looking up the Goddess of the Dawn (Aurora), or for looking up an extinct European wild ox (Aurochs). This is particularly interesting as the technique described requires 'no equipment other than that which is normally to be found on a paediatric ward. ' The editors must control the indiscriminate changing of the spelling of words as they lose their original meaning and the resultant language becomes unintelligible-for example, Archoves of Dosease in Choldhood, or even necrotosing enterocolotos...|$|E
