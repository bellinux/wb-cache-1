25|$|Scott {{believed}} {{he needed to}} confirm the trials and sentences. He concluded that some men deserved less punishment, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> nights attempting to find excuses to avoid the universal application of capital punishment. In the end he approved {{the death penalty for}} 50 of the 72 San Patricios, but later pardoned five and reduced the sentence of fifteen others, including the ringleader, Sergeant John Riley. This left 30 slated for execution, 16 of whom were hanged on September 10, 1847. Four were hanged the next day, and the remainder assigned to Colonel William Harney for execution at some later date.|$|E
25|$|VanDerveer {{sent out}} resumes to twenty schools, {{looking for a}} {{graduate}} assistant job, which is an unpaid position. She only got two responses, {{one of which was}} for Ohio State, where the athletic director had remembered her from Indiana. To prepare herself, she attended a coaching clinic taught by Knight. When she had attended his practices, she had stayed out of sight, but enrolled in a class, she followed her parents advice <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> front. One of the coaches asked if she was lost. Knight embarrassed her with one of his questions, but she didn't stop attending, although she moved back a few rows. She was hired as an assistant coach to the varsity and the head coach of the JV.|$|E

500|$|On 29 September 1930, Waugh was {{received}} into the Catholic Church. This shocked {{his family and}} surprised some of his friends, but he had contemplated the step for some time. He had lost his Anglicanism at Lancing and had led an irreligious life at Oxford, but there are references in his diaries from the mid-1920s to religious discussion and regular churchgoing. On 22 December 1925, Waugh wrote: [...] "Claud and I took Audrey to supper <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> until 7 in the morning arguing about the Roman Church". The entry for 20 February 1927 includes, [...] "I am to visit a Father Underhill about being a parson". Throughout the period, Waugh was influenced by his friend Olivia Plunket-Greene, who had converted in 1925 and of whom Waugh later wrote, [...] "She bullied me into the Church". It was she who led him to Father Martin D'Arcy, a Jesuit, who persuaded Waugh [...] "on firm intellectual convictions but little emotion" [...] that [...] "the Christian revelation was genuine". In 1949, Waugh explained that his conversion followed his realisation that life was [...] "unintelligible and unendurable without God".|$|E

[...] Their friendship continued {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|E
2500|$|Milton's first datable {{compositions}} are two psalms done at age 15 at Long Bennington. One contemporary {{source is}} the Brief Lives of John Aubrey, an uneven compilation including first-hand reports. In the work, Aubrey quotes Christopher, Milton's younger brother: [...] "When he was young, he studied very hard <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> very late, commonly till twelve or one o'clock at night". Aubrey adds, [...] "“His complexion exceeding faire—he was so faire that {{they called him}} the Lady of Christ’s College.” ...|$|E

2500|$|After a few years, he {{was sent}} to St. Paul's School, which was run by Alexander Gil, William Sound, and Oliver Smythe. Gil had a {{reputation}} for scholarship in Greek, Latin, and theology. He was also a proponent of English grammar structures and relied on poetry, including that written by Edmund Spenser and Philip Sidney, to discuss the English language. Milton travelled each day between school and home, and his path took him by St Paul's. It is possible that he listened to the sermons put on during this time by John Donne. John Aubrey, in Brief Lives, quotes his brother Christopher to describe how Milton spent his time: [...] "When he went to school, when he was very young, he studied very hard <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> very late, commonly till twelve or one o'clock at night; and his father ordered the main to sit up for him". Milton later attributed his blindness, in his Defensio Secunda, to the rigorous study that he undetook during this time.|$|E
2500|$|His father {{thought the}} voyage {{a waste of}} his son's time and {{strongly}} objected. Dejected, Charles declined the offer, and went to Maer for the partridge shooting with a note from his father to [...] "Uncle Jos" [...] Wedgwood. This contained a prescription for a bowel ailment and a note saying that Charles had quite given up the proposed [...] "voyage of discovery", but [...] "if you think differently from me I shall wish him to follow your advice." [...] Charles' hopes were revived by this unexpected news, and his relatives came out in favour of the voyage. He outlined his father's objections, <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> that night drafting a reply with his uncle. Jos wrote suggesting that Charles {{would be likely to}} [...] "acquire and strengthen, habits of application", and [...] "Natural History... is very suitable to a Clergyman." [...] Though [...] "useless as regards his profession", for [...] "a man of enlarged curiosity, it affords him such an opportunity of seeing men and things as happens to few". The Admiralty would look after him well, but [...] "you & Charles... must decide." [...] Charles begged [...] "one favour... a decided answer, yes or no." [...] This reply was sent post-haste early on the morning of 1 September and Charles went shooting. About 10 o'clock he received word from his uncle that they should go to The Mount at once. When they arrived a few hours later, Charles' father had decided that he would give [...] "all the assistance in my power".|$|E
2500|$|With Geoff Pullar {{unable to}} play Colin Cowdrey opened for England again, a role {{he did not}} relish and after making two runs he was out, mis-hitting a ball from Alan Davidson to Neil Harvey at {{backward}} short-leg, who darted forward to take it at grass height. David Sheppard became Neil Hawke's first Test wicket, catching a full blooded cover drive off his own bowling. This made England 39/2 after 108 minutes and with Ken Barrington entrenched at one end the crowd were looked to Ted Dexter to produce some excitement. The wicket was dead {{and the sky was}} clear, so there was no chance of the ball swinging and the famous Sydney Hill was becoming restless, Barrington raising his cap when he was jeered and a slow hand clap started around the ground as Dexter played himself in. This was briefly curtailed when Barrington glanced a full toss from Garth McKenzie for four and Dexter hit three fours off Bobby Simpson. Norm O'Neill caught Barrington on the pads and appealed, but no else joined in and the Englishman stayed put. Australia were running through 14-15 overs an hour, the fastest so far in the series, but with such defensive play the effort was wasted. Dexter was out after lunch edging O'Neill (1/38) to Simpson at first slip for 47 and Tom Graveney almost went the same way to Benaud. At 5:15 pm the batsmen appealed for light, but were turned down and five minutes later he glanced McKenzie (1/57) off his legs, but [...] "Harvey, anticipating, shot out his left hand; he somersaulted and momentarily stood on his head, then he rolled over <b>and</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> still clutching the ball." [...] Barrington usually woke up when his century was in sight, and a sweep of Simpson was dropped by Brian Booth, but a drive found its way to the boundary and a single brought up his hundred and a surprisingly generous round of applause from the stadium. He drove Benaud straight to Harvey in the covers, who bruised a finger taking his third catch, out for 101 after 320 minutes. Ray Illingworth and Fred Titmus lasted until stumps, with England 195/5 after a full day's play. The second day continued in the same dull way, or perhaps worse as only three boundaries were hit between the two sides. Illingworth (27) and Titmus (34) produced, long, slow innings occasionally interrupted by drizzle before they were both caught by Wally Grout, one off Davidson and the other off Hawke (2/57). Even Fred Trueman played a subdued innings before he was caught by Harvey off Benaud for 30. Alan Smith was bowled by Simpson (1/51) and David Allen and Brian Statham finally livened things up with a last wicket stand of 28 in 35 minutes until Benaud caught Allen off Davidson (3/43). England's 321 had taken them nine and a half hours, an innings more akin to saving a lost cause than trying to win a match.|$|E
