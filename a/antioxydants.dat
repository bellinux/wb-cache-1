Recently, melatonin was considered by some authors as a “wonder drug. ” The present paper tries to summarize the relationship between melatonin and aging in three points. 1. Decline of melatonin production during aging. 2. The role of the pineal gland in the regulation of the ovarian cycle in aged females. 3. The <b>antioxydant</b> effect of melatonin and aging. The age-related decline of pineal melatonin production {{is due to the}} degenerative changes of the neural structures (serotonergic and norad-renergic neuron systems) innervating the pineal gland and the supra-chiasmatic nuclei rather than to the degeneration of the pineal tissue itself. The decreased melatonin production of the pineal gland preceds the destruction of ovarian cyclicity which can be partly counteracted by mel atonin or by 5 -hydroxytryptophane administration. The <b>antioxydant</b> effect of melatonin might explain its lifespan-prolonging effect, at least to a certain degree. ...|$|R

However, ozone causes variations on the quantities of nutrients of edible plants, thus influencing their nutritional value to man. In the present paper, {{an overview of the}} acquired knowledge on the impact of ozone on nutritional value of edible plants is presented. More particularly, ozone impact on the nutritional value of potato (Solanum tuberosum), tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), wheat (Triticum spp), spinach (Spinacia oleracea) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa) is presented and analyzed. In leafy vegetables are presented reductions in micronutrient components (vitamins, inorganic constitutive), while in the fruits and in the tubers are presented fluctuations mainly in the makronutrient components (proteins, carbohydrates). Changes in other components as <b>antioxydant,</b> antinutritional factors are also observed. The consequences in the Mediterranean diet when using these plants is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Improvement of breast-cancer {{detection}} {{through the}} identification of potential cancer biomarkers is considered as a promising strategy for effective assessment of the disease. The current study has used nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis with subsequent analysis by mass spectrometry to identify protein alterations in invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast from Tunisian women. We have identified multiple protein alterations in tumor tissues that were picked, processed, and unambiguously assigned identities by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). The proteins identified span {{a wide range of}} functions and are believed to have potential clinical applications as cancer biomarkers. They include glycolytic enzymes, molecular chaperones, cytoskeletal-related proteins, <b>antioxydant</b> enzymes, and immunologic related proteins. Among these proteins, enolase 1, phosphoglycerate kinase 1, deoxyhemoglobin, Mn-superoxyde dismutase, alpha-B-crystallin, HSP 27, Raf kinase inhibitor protein, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A 2 /B 1, cofilin 1, and peptidylprolyl isomerase A were overexpressed in tumors compared with normal tissues. In contrast, the IGHG 1 protein, the complement C 3 component C 3 c, which are two newly identified protein markers, were downregulated in IDCA tissues...|$|R

The {{purpose of the}} work: to reveal {{the role of the}} lipides peroxidation processes and changes of the structure-functional state of membranes of erythrocytes and microsomes of various mice tissues in the response reaction to the multiple continuous action of the hyperbaric helio-oxygen medium and to the after-action period of time. First investigated has been the dynamics of the structurefunctional state of the erythrocytic and microsomal membranes at the multiple action of the hyperbaric breathing mixture. The change in the P- 450 cytochrome activity, the key link of the microsome monooxygenase system under the hyperbaric conditions has been revealed. On the basis of the obtained information, it is possible to correct, with the aid of the <b>antioxydant</b> nature membrane-protectors, the state of the lipide phase of the membrane-structure cells of which its functional activity depends. Besides, the information about the erythrocytic and microsomal membranes state will allow to select the optimal modes of operation of the divers in the futureAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{assess the}} {{relationships}} between sociodemographic factors, {{quality of life and}} attitudes towards psychotropic drugs and dependency and to compare those relationships in continuous consumers (CC), occasional consumers (OC) and non-consumers (NC) of those drugs. Methods: Quality of life (SF 36) and attitudes (14 statements) were measured in 601 subjects (45 – 60 years old) from the SUVIMAX cohort (SUpple´mentation en VItamines et en sels Mine ´raux <b>AntioXydants).</b> Data were obtained on 334 NC, 142 CC, 125 OC from the inclusion questionnaire and the monthly consumption report notebooks kept by subjects between 1994 and 1998. Dichotomous and polychotomous logistic regressions were used for the analysis. Results: The lower the quality of life score the more frequent was consumption. NC tended to be men, with high quality of life scores. They entertained negative attitudes towards psychotropics and dependency. OC tended to be women reporting a chronic pathology, with fairly high social status. They had intermediate quality of life and denied dependency. CC tended to be men with no professional activity and low quality of life scores in particular for mental health and perceived health. They had positive attitudes towards psychotropics and accept dependency. Discussion: Assessment of patients’ quality of life and understanding of their attitudes towards psychotropics can provide essential information for those in charge of health promotionprogrammes and may help in identifying new intervention strategies. Preventive education and follow-up of therapy may be better suited to the needs of patient...|$|E
40|$|Background-Cardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVD) are {{the leading}} cause of death in the world, and diet plays a major role in CVD incidence, especially through lipid oxidation mechanisms. This, in turn, leads to tissue inflammation and formation of atheromatous plaques. Methods and Results-Our objective was to evaluate the association between the inflammatory potential of the diet and the incidence of overall CVD or its subclasses. We included 7743 participants from the Supplementation en Vitamines et Mineraux <b>AntioXydants</b> (SU. VI. MAX) cohort. All cardiovascular events were recorded using self-reported information or clinical visits, and were validated. The dietary inflammatory index (DII) was computed using repeated 24 -hour dietary records (mean= 9. 5 +/- 3. 4 records/subject). Hazard ratio and 95 % CI for outcomes (CVD and subclasses) were estimated across sex-specific quartiles of the DII using Cox proportional hazard models. A total of 292 cardiovascular events were recorded and validated during an average of 11. 4 years of follow-up: 93 myocardial infarctions, 58 strokes, 128 angina pectoris and revascularization interventions, and 13 significantly associated with a higher risk of myocardial infarction (hazard ratio(Quartile 4 versus Quartile 1) = 2. 24, 95 % CI: 1. 08 - 4. 67). No significant association was observed between the DII score and stroke or both angina pectoris and revascularization intervention. Conclusions-A pro-inflammatory diet, as measured by a higher DII score, was prospectively associated with a higher risk of myocardial infarction. Promotion of a diet exhibiting anti-inflammatory properties may help prevent myocardial infarctions...|$|E
40|$|Diet and {{physical}} activity {{are considered to be}} major components of a healthy lifestyle. However, few studies have examined in detail the relationships between specific types of physical activity, sedentary behaviour and diet in adults. The objective {{of the present study was}} to assess differential relationships between dietary patterns, leisure-time and occupational physical activities and time spent watching television (TV), as an indicator of sedentary behaviour, in middle-aged French subjects. We performed a cross-sectional analysis using data from 1359 participants in the SUpplémentation en VItamines et Minéraux <b>AntioXydants</b> study, who completed a detailed physical activity questionnaire and at least six 24 h dietary records. Sex-specific dietary patterns were derived using factor analysis; their relationships with leisure-time and occupational physical activities and TV viewing were assessed using ANCOVA, after adjustment for age, educational level and smoking status. Three dietary patterns were identified in each sex. After adjustment for potential confounders, leisure-time physical activity was positively associated with a 'healthy' food pattern in both men (P for trend < 0 * 01) and women (P for trend < 0 * 03) and negatively associated with an 'alcohol/meat' pattern in men (P for trend < 0 * 01). TV viewing was positively associated with a 'convenience' pattern in men and with a 'alcohol-appetiser' pattern in women. In conclusion, identification of relationships between dietary patterns, physical activity and sedentary behaviour can enable identification of different types of lifestyle and should help to target at-risk groups in nutrition prevention programmes...|$|E

The {{purpose of the}} work: to study {{the role of the}} liver in {{regulation}} of the spatial-temporal organisation of exchange of iron, the products of the peroxide lipide oxydation and the level of alpha-tocopherol in the blood plasma and erythrocytes membranes, and to experimentally justify the principles of <b>antioxydant</b> chronopharmacocorrection of the processes of hyperlipoperoxidation of the cellular membranes in the hepatosis. The role of the liver in regulation of the day rhythmicity of sideremina, the products of the lipides peroxide oxydation, alphy-tocopherol has been determined. It has been established, that the dismatching of the circadian rhytm of the peroxide lipides oxydation (PLO) in the blood, to be induced with tetrachlormethane, is being accompanied by the inter-system desynchronosis of alpha-tocopherol metabolism, on the base of which, the principles of the chronobiological approach to the antioxidants application have been developed. The principles of the antioxidant chronopharmacocorrection of the processes of the cellular membranes hyperlipoperoxidation with the parenchimatose damage to the liver have been developed.

40|$|Marine Synechococcus {{cyanobacteria}} {{constitute a}} monophyletic group that displays a wide latitudinal distribution, {{ranging from the}} equator to the polar fronts. Whether these organisms are all physiologically adapted to stand a large temperature gradient or stenotherms with narrow growth temperature ranges has so far remained unexplored. We submitted a panel of six strains, isolated along a gradient of latitude in the North Atlantic Ocean, to long- and short-term variations of temperature. Upon a downward shift of temperature, the strains showed strikingly distinct resistance, seemingly related to their latitude of isolation, with tropical strains collapsing while northern strains were capable of growing. This behaviour was associated to differential photosynthetic performances. In the tropical strains, the rapid photosystem II inactivation and the decrease of the <b>antioxydant</b> b-carotene relative to chl a suggested a strong induction of oxidative stress. These different responses {{were related to the}} thermal preferenda of the strains. The northern strains could grow at 10 1 C while the other strains preferred higher temperatures. In addition, we pointed out a correspondence between strain isolation temperature and phylogeny. In particular, clades I and IV laboratory strains were all collected in the coldest waters of the distribution area of marine Synechococus. We, however, show that clade I Synechococcus exhibit different levels o...|$|R
40|$|Dans ce travail, nous avons montré qu'un effet cardioprotecteur peut être obtenu en inhibant l'ouverture du pore de {{transition}} de permeabilité mitochondrial au cours de l'ischémie-reperfusion myocardique, soit directement en agissant sur le recepteur périphérique aux benzodiazépines, soit indirectement en inactivant la GSK- 3 beta, ces deux stratégies ayant potentiellement en commun un effet <b>antioxydant</b> indispensable à la protection du cardiomyocyte. Myocradial ischemia-reperfusion injuries require cardiprotective {{approaches to}} improve the repermeabilization of coronaries arteries. So in this work {{we looked at the}} mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) inhibition as this pore is implicated in ischemia-reperfusion injury. We used two pharmalogical strategies to inhibit it. (i) the first one targeted a mitonchondrial outer membrane receptor, the peripheral benzodiazepine (PBR), which is a putative component of mPTP. The cardioprotectio, mediated by PBR was evaluated by 4 '-chlorodiazépam (CDZ) a specific PBR ligand. We used a model of global ischemia-reperfusion in isolated rat hearts and a model of regional myocardial ischemia-reperfusion in anaestheized rat. We showed that CDZ reduced infarct size afetr ischemia-reperfusion, improved mitochondrial funcions and decreased apotosis. we observed a reduction of cytochrome C and apoptosis inducing factors (AIF) release with a limitation of membrane permeability and with mPTP inhibition. We also demonstrated that this effect was related to a modification of the balance of the Bel- 2 family proteins {{at the level of the}} mitochondrial outer member. Indeed, DCZ stabilized the association of bel- 2 with the mitochondrial membrane and reduced the interaction of Bax. (ii) The second strategy aimed at stimulation the reperfusion injury salavage kinase (RISK), an endogenous protection cascade implied in pre and postconditioning, asthe cardioprotective effect mediated by RISK was suggested to be linked to mPTP inhibition. We used morphine a well-known cardioprotective opioid ligand which was shown to activated the RISK pathway and to inihibit glycogen synthase kinase - 3 beta (GSK- 3 beta). We showed that morphine reduced infarct size in a model of regional myocardial ischemia-reperfusion in rats improved mitochondrials functions. This cardioprotective effect was confirmed in isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes subjected to anoxia-reoxygenation as morphine delayed mPTP opening and increased cell survival. The protection afforded by morphine in vitro and in vivo was mimicked by the GSK- 3 Beta inhibitor SB 16763, and was abolished by mortmannine a PI 3 K inhibitor. These results confirmed the involvement of the RISK pathway in the cardioprotective effect of both morphine and SB 216763 and demonstrated a link between this pathway and mPTP inhibition. In a last part we showed that these two strategies had in common an <b>antioxydant</b> effect which appears necessary ti inhibit mPTP and to protect cardiomyocytes. taken together these results demonstrate and pharmacological strategy limiting the mitochondrial permeability acting on mPTP is essential to protect the myocardium.
