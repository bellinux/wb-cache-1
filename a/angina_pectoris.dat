5|$|Toothache may {{be caused}} by dental (odontogenic) {{conditions}} (such as those involving the dentin-pulp complex or periodontium), or by non-dental (non-odontogenic) conditions (such as maxillary sinusitis or <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris).</b> There are many possible non-dental causes, {{but the vast majority of}} toothache is dental in origin.|$|E
5|$|Accelerated {{deposition}} of cholesterol {{in the walls}} of arteries leads to atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. The most common problem in FH {{is the development of}} coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries that supply the heart) at a much younger age than would be expected in the general population. This may lead to <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> (chest pain or tightness on exertion) or heart attacks. Less commonly, arteries of the brain are affected; this may lead to transient ischemic attacks (brief episodes of weakness {{on one side of the}} body or inability to talk) or occasionally stroke. Peripheral artery occlusive disease (obstruction of the arteries of the legs) occurs mainly in people with FH who smoke; this can cause pain in the calf muscles during walking that resolves with rest (intermittent claudication) and problems due to a decreased blood supply to the feet (such as gangrene).|$|E
5|$|Pulpitis is {{classified}} as reversible when the pain is mild to moderate and lasts {{for a short time}} after a stimulus (for instance, cold or sweet); or irreversible when the pain is severe, spontaneous, and lasts a long time after a stimulus. Left untreated, pulpitis may become irreversible, then progress to pulp necrosis (death of the pulp) and apical periodontitis. Abscesses usually cause throbbing pain. The apical abscess usually occurs after pulp necrosis, the pericoronal abscess is usually associated with acute pericoronitis of a lower wisdom tooth, and periodontal abscesses usually represent a complication of chronic periodontitis (gum disease). Much less commonly, non-dental conditions can cause toothache, such as maxillary sinusitis, which can cause pain in the upper back teeth, or <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris,</b> which can cause pain in the lower teeth.|$|E
25|$|Angina, {{also known}} as <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris,</b> is chest pain or pressure, usually due to not enough {{blood flow to the}} heart muscle.|$|E
25|$|Nadolol is used {{to treat}} {{hypertension}} and for long-term treatment of <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> and is approved by the FDA for these purposes.|$|E

25|$|In 1931, {{at the age}} of 53, he died of <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> at {{his home}} in Great Neck, Long Island where he had lived for 13 years. He was survived by his widow Helen and {{daughter}} Jessie.|$|E
25|$|Side {{effects of}} the pill form include, in {{decreasing}} order of frequency, nausea, hallucinations, confusion, depression, loss of balance, insomnia, increased involuntary movements, agitation, arrhythmia, slow heart rate, delusions, hypertension, new or increased <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris,</b> and syncope.|$|E
25|$|Atherosclerosis is {{the most}} common cause of {{stenosis}} (narrowing of the blood vessels) of the heart's arteries and, hence, <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris.</b> Some people with chest pain have normal or minimal narrowing of heart arteries; in these patients, vasospasm is a more likely cause for the pain, sometimes in the context of Prinzmetal's angina and syndrome X.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt, a chain-smoker {{throughout}} his entire adult life, {{had been in}} declining physical health since at least 1940, and by 1944 he was noticeably fatigued. In March 1944, shortly after his 62nd birthday, he underwent testing at Bethesda Hospital and {{was found to have}} high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease causing <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris,</b> and congestive heart failure.|$|E
25|$|In the Rotterdam Study, Bots et al. {{followed}} 7,983 patients >55 {{years of}} age for a mean period of 4.6 years, and reported 194 incident myocardial infarctions within this period. CIMT was significantly higher in the myocardial infarction group {{compared to the other}} group. Demircan et al. found that the CIMT of patients with acute coronary syndrome were significantly increased compared to patients with stable <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris.</b>|$|E
25|$|Jenner {{and others}} formed the Fleece Medical Society or Gloucestershire Medical Society, so called because it {{met in the}} parlour of the Fleece Inn, Rodborough (in Gloucestershire), meeting to dine {{together}} and read papers on medical subjects. Jenner contributed papers on <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris,</b> ophthalmia, and cardiac valvular disease and commented on cowpox. He also belonged to a similar society which met in Alveston, near Bristol.|$|E
25|$|Sulfhydryl-containing compounds. The {{metabolism}} {{of organic}} nitrates to nitric oxide {{is dependent on}} the presence of sulfhydryl groups in the muscle. The combination of oral N-acetylcysteine and a single dose of sustained-release isosorbide mononitrate 60nbsp&mg significantly prolonged the total exercise time in patients with <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> and angiographically proven significant coronary artery disease, when compared with isosorbide mononitrate alone. Concomitant administration of other exogenous sources of sulfhydryl groups such as methionine and captopril may produce a similar interaction.|$|E
25|$|The French chemist Antoine Jérôme Balard {{synthesized}} {{amyl nitrite}} In 1844. Sir Thomas Lauder Brunton, a Scottish physician {{born in the}} year of amyl nitrite's first synthesis, famously pioneered its use to treat <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris.</b> Brunton was inspired by earlier work with the same agent, performed by Arthur Gamgee and Benjamin Ward Richardson. Brunton reasoned that the angina sufferer's pain and discomfort could be reduced by administering amyl nitrite—to dilate the coronary arteries of patients, thus improving blood flow to the heart muscle.|$|E
25|$|Referred pain, {{also called}} {{reflective}} pain, is pain perceived {{at a location}} other than {{the site of the}} painful stimulus. An example is the case of <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> brought on by a myocardial infarction (heart attack), where pain is often felt in the neck, shoulders, and back rather than in the thorax (chest), the site of the injury. The International Association for the Study of Pain has not officially defined the term; hence several authors have defined the term differently.|$|E
25|$|In {{his last}} years Leskov {{suffered}} from <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> and asthma. There were also rumours, whose accuracy and substantiation have been questioned, {{that he had}} been diagnosed with male breast cancer. In early 1894 he caught a severe cold; {{by the end of the}} year his general condition had deteriorated. Responding to Pavel Tretyakov's special request, Leskov (still very ill) agreed to pose for Valentin Serov, but in February 1895, when the portrait was exhibited in the Tretyakovskaya Gallery, he felt utterly upset both by the portrait and the black frame.|$|E
25|$|The sublingual region {{underneath}} {{the front of}} the tongue is an ideal location for the administration of certain medications into the body. The oral mucosa is very thin {{underneath the}} tongue, and is underlain by a plexus of veins. The sublingual route takes advantage of the highly vascular quality of the oral cavity, and allows for the speedy application of medication into the cardiovascular system, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract. This is the only convenient and efficacious route of administration (apart from Intravenous therapy) of nitroglycerin to a patient suffering chest pain from <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1950 Bruce {{joined the}} University of Washington, where he {{continued}} {{research on the}} single-stage test, particularly {{as a predictor of}} the success of surgery for valvular or congenital heart disease. Later he developed the multistage test, consisting of several stages of progressively greater workloads. It was this multistage test, a description of which was first published in 1963, that became known as the Bruce Protocol. In the initial paper, Bruce reported that the test could detect signs of such conditions as <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris,</b> a previous heart attack, or a ventricular aneurysm. Bruce his and colleagues also demonstrated that exercise testing was useful in screening apparently healthy people for early signs of coronary artery disease.|$|E
25|$|In April 1963, {{toxicity}} {{tests for}} pronethalol showed results of thymic tumours in mice. Nevertheless, it was launched under the trade name Alderlin, {{as the first}} clinically useful β-blocker. The launch took place in November 1963 when many small-scale clinical trials had proved their effectiveness in angina and certain types of arrhythmias. Pronethalol was only marketed for use in life-threatening situations. Dr. James Black went on to create another β-blocker, called propranolol; a non-selective β-blocker. Clinical trials started {{in the summer of}} 1964 and a year later, propranolol was launched under the trade name Inderal, only {{two and a half years}} after it had first been tested. It turned out to have a higher potency than pronethalol, with fewer side effects. Propranolol became the first major drug in the treatment of <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris,</b> since the introduction of coronary vasodilators, (such as nitroglycerin), almost 100 years earlier. Propranolol became a best-selling drug, used to treat a wide range of cardiovascular diseases such as arrhythmia, hypertension and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, James Black, a Scottish pharmacologist, and {{associates}} of his at the Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in Great Britain {{were working on}} a series of β-adrenergic blocking compounds, pronethalol and propranolol. Dr. Black focused on developing a drug that would relieve the pain of <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris,</b> which results from oxygen deprivation in the heart. His plan was to create a drug that would decrease the heart’s requirement for oxygen. He hypothesized that these compounds would lower the heart’s oxygen consumption by interfering with the effects of catecholamines. In 1958, the pharmacological properties of dichloroisoproterenol (DCI) were described, a β-antagonist discovered a few years before by the Eli Lilly group. It was the synthesis of DCI which established that β-receptors could be chemically blocked and thus its existence could be confirmed. DCI had no clinical utility but a replacement of the 3,4-dichloro substituents, with a carbon bridge to form a naphtylethanolamine derivative, afforded a clinical candidate, pronethalol.|$|E
25|$|<b>Angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> can {{be quite}} painful, but many {{patients}} with angina complain of chest discomfort rather than actual pain: the discomfort is usually described as a pressure, heaviness, tightness, squeezing, burning, or choking sensation. Apart from chest discomfort, anginal pains may also be experienced in the epigastrium (upper central abdomen), back, neck area, jaw, or shoulders. This is explained by the concept of referred pain, and {{is due to the}} fact that the spinal level that receives visceral sensation from the heart simultaneously receives cutaneous sensation from parts of the skin specified by that spinal nerve's dermatome, without an ability to discriminate the two. Typical locations for referred pain are arms (often inner left arm), shoulders, and neck into the jaw. Angina is typically precipitated by exertion or emotional stress. It is exacerbated by having a full stomach and by cold temperatures. Pain may be accompanied by breathlessness, sweating, and nausea in some cases. In this case, the pulse rate and the blood pressure increases. Chest pain lasting only a few seconds is normally not angina (such as precordial catch syndrome).|$|E
25|$|The main {{goals of}} {{treatment}} in <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> are relief of symptoms, slowing {{progression of the}} disease, and reduction of future events, especially heart attacks and death. Beta blockers (e.g., carvedilol, propranolol, atenolol) have {{a large body of}} evidence in morbidity and mortality benefits (fewer symptoms, less disability and longer life) and short-acting nitroglycerin medications have been used since 1879 for symptomatic relief of angina. Calcium channel blockers (such as nifedipine (Adalat) and amlodipine), isosorbide mononitrate and nicorandil are vasodilators commonly used in chronic stable angina. A new therapeutic class, called If inhibitor, has recently been made available: Ivabradine provides pure heart rate reduction leading to major anti-ischemic and antianginal efficacy. ACE inhibitors are also vasodilators with both symptomatic and prognostic benefit. Statins are the most frequently used lipid/cholesterol modifiers, which probably also stabilize existing atheromatous plaque. Low-dose aspirin decreases the risk of heart attack in patients with chronic stable angina, and was part of standard treatment. However, in patients without established cardiovascular disease, the increase in hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding offsets any benefits and it is no longer advised unless the risk of myocardial infarction is very high.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} in another study that a maximal CIMT value of 0.956mm had 85.7% sensitivity and 85.1% specificity to predict angiographic CAD. The study group consisted of patients admitted to the cardiology outpatient clinic with symptoms of stable <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris.</b> The study showed CIMT was higher in patients with significant CAD than in patients with non-critical coronary lesions. Regression analysis revealed that thickening of the mean intima-media complex more than 1.0 was predictive of significant CAD our patients. There was incremental significant increase in CIMT with the number coronary vessel involved. In accordance with the literature, it was found that CIMT was significantly higher in the presence of CAD. Furthermore, CIMT was increased as the number of involved vessels increased and the highest CIMT values were noted in patients with left main coronary involvement. However, human clinical trials have been slow to provide clinical & medical evidence, partly because the asymptomatic nature of atheromata make them especially difficult to study. Promising results are found using carotid intima-media thickness scanning (CIMT can be measured by B-mode ultrasonography), B-vitamins that reduce a protein corrosive, homocysteine and that reduce neck carotid artery plaque volume and thickness, and stroke, even in late-stage disease.|$|E

500|$|Non-dental {{causes of}} {{toothache}} {{are much less}} common as compared with dental causes. [...] In a toothache of neurovascular origin, pain is reported in the teeth {{in conjunction with a}} migraine. Local and distant structures (such as ear, brain, carotid artery, or heart) can also refer pain to the teeth. Other non-dental causes of toothache include myofascial pain (muscle pain) and <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> (which classically refers pain to the lower jaw). [...] Very rarely, toothache can be psychogenic in origin.|$|E
500|$|Following a chalk-talk {{performance}} in Moncton, New Brunswick in 1922, Bengough suffered {{an attack of}} <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris,</b> attributed to overwork during a previous tour of Western Canada.

500|$|Establishing a {{diagnosis}} of nondental toothache is initially done by careful questioning about the site, nature, aggravating and relieving factors, and referral of the pain, then ruling out any dental causes. [...] There are no specific treatments for nondental pain (each treatment is directed at {{the cause of the}} pain, rather than the toothache itself), but a dentist can assist in offering potential sources of the pain and direct the patient to appropriate care. The most critical nondental source is the radiation of <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> into the lower teeth and the potential need for urgent cardiac care.|$|E
500|$|After his {{military}} retirement, from 1971–74, Hartmann {{worked as a}} flight instructor in Hangelar, near Bonn, and also flew in an aerobatics team with Adolf Galland. In 1980 he caught a cold that developed into <b>angina</b> <b>pectoris</b> — the condition that had killed his father {{at the age of}} 58. He recovered and, by 1983, was medically cleared to fly, after which he resumed instructing at the various flying schools. However, fearing a second attack, he became cautious and limited his appearances at public events. [...] He stated: [...] "I am retired and I am a civilian, and now I like to have my rest and peace.
