5|$|Alfano {{was accused}} of being {{the man behind the}} murder of rival Camorra boss Gennaro Cuocolo and his wife. The trial against Alfano and his {{associates}} in Viterbo in 1911–12, expanded from a murder case into a tribunal against the Camorra and attracted a lot of attention of newspapers and the general public both in Italy {{as well as in the}} United States. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison in July 1912, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the legitimacy of the trial was seriously questioned when the main witness for the prosecution retracted, he was only released in 1934 after having served 27 years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of this feud, Germanicus became ill <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> Piso had removed himself to the port of Seleucia, he was {{convinced}} that Piso was somehow poisoning him. Tacitus reports that there were signs of black magic in Piso's house with hidden body parts and Germanicus' name inscribed on lead tablets. Germanicus sent Piso a letter formally renouncing their friendship (amicitia). Germanicus died soon after on 10 October of that year. His death aroused much speculation, with several sources blaming Piso, acting under orders from Emperor Tiberius. This was never proven, and Piso later died while facing trial. Tiberius feared the people of Rome knew of the conspiracy against Germanicus, but Tiberius' jealousy and fear of his nephew's popularity and increasing power was the true motive as understood by Tacitus.|$|E
5|$|Bradford {{opened the}} scoring after only eight {{minutes of the}} match through teenage {{hometown}} midfielder Hamilton. A long pass from Huxford down the right flank was headed by Shutt into Hamilton's path. He beat three defenders <b>and,</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> he was stumbling, shot past Notts County goalkeeper Ward, with the ball going in after hitting the crossbar. It had been Bradford's first shot of the game. Steve Finnan had County's first chance after 14 minutes but shot straight at Bradford keeper Jonathan Gould. Minutes later, City had two successive chances through Shutt and Youds, but the first was blocked and the second went wide. During this spell of play, County's two central defenders Murphy and Gary Strodder both received yellow cards. Just before half-time, Shutt {{had the chance to}} double City's lead but his weak shot hit Ward's ankles after good work by Kiwomya.|$|E

5000|$|The name [...] "Scrooge" [...] {{is used in}} English as a {{word for}} {{a person who is}} misanthropic <b>and</b> tight-fisted <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> Ebenezer Scrooge {{reformed}} later.|$|R
50|$|Viki Davidson and Charlie Banks tie {{the knot}} {{in a double}} {{ceremony}} with Clint <b>and</b> Nora, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Nora is really in love with Bo. Dorian Lord and Blair Cramer crash the nuptials in a drunken fit.|$|R
5|$|Since {{the number}} of pack animals and {{carriers}} was limited, the requirements for stores and supplies of all types, including rations, ammunition, ordnance, signals equipment and medical supplies, were submitted to 7th Division headquarters, which allocated movement priorities. One of Richardson's first actions was to obtain more saddlery for the pack horses. He also acquired five more American jeeps to augment the five that had been working the jeep track. The original five {{were found to be}} in poor condition, and needed overhaul. While the 25th Infantry Brigade was conducting operations in the Imita Ridge area, the carry was short, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that there were no suitable air dropping zones, the supply situation was good. As the Australians began advancing toward Kokoda again in October, the supply line became steadily longer, and the demand for carriers more acute.|$|E
5|$|Homer, {{who still}} wants to party, rents an airboat and forces his family to come with him. He races through a swamp, accidentally killing the state's most famous {{resident}} and reptile – an alligator named Captain Jack, whom Marge, Maggie, Lisa, and Bart saw on a tour earlier while Homer made a fool of himself at the concert. A sheriff quickly arrives on the scene <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Homer is the sole guilty culprit, the entire family is charged for killing the alligator. The family members flee from the sheriff and during a car chase they are hit by a train that pushes their car on the rail for several miles. When the Simpsons get off of the rail, they escape to a restaurant where they are given employment. They live in a nearby trailer and progressively turn into hillbillies. The sheriff eventually tracks them down and kidnaps them while they are sleeping. For their crimes (and Homer's foolish attempt at defending himself in court), the family is put into forced labor. One night when they are working at a party held by a judge {{in front of the}} capitol, tending to the guests (and failing to escape), Captain Jack strolls out of the capitol's doors. It turns out that he was never dead but rather knocked out. The family is acquitted, though they are banned from entering the state of Florida again (and several other states, excluding Arizona and North Dakota).|$|E
25|$|During {{that first}} season the team {{came to be}} known by the {{nickname}} The Purdown Poachers, after the location of their home pitch, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> they only played there for a single season the moniker stuck for some time.|$|E
25|$|Proteins are {{frequently}} described as consisting of several structural units.

50|$|Back in London Williams felt {{underemployed}} <b>and</b> despondent. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he {{had witnessed}} first-hand two wars, three civil wars and revolutions, and was applauded {{as one of the}} great journalists of his age, he now found himself jobless.|$|R
25|$|Provincially, however, it has {{remained}} Liberal. In the 2011 provincial election, the riding stayed Liberal (albeit by a narrow margin) despite the retirement of popular Liberal incumbent Jean Marc Lalonde, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the Liberals lost nearly twenty seats across Ontario.|$|E
25|$|Despite Feynman's warnings, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Vaughan {{served on}} safety boards and {{committees}} at NASA, the subsequent press coverage has found {{some evidence that}} NASA's relative disregard for safety might persist to this day. For example, NASA discounted the risk from small foam chunk breakage at launch and assumed {{that the lack of}} damage from prior foam collisions suggested the future risk was low.|$|E
25|$|Having gone totally {{blind in}} 1652, Milton wrote Paradise Lost entirely through {{dictation}} {{with the help}} of amanuenses and friends. He also wrote the epic poem while he was often ill, suffering from gout, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he was suffering emotionally after the early death of his second wife, Katherine Woodcock, in 1658, and the death of their infant daughter. Milton remarried five years later in 1663.|$|E
50|$|Across the country, militants {{attacked}} churches, convents, and monasteries, killing {{priests and}} looking for arms, since the conspiracy theory maintained that the religious had guns, <b>and</b> this <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that not a single serviceable weapon was located in the raids.|$|R
50|$|The city of Iğdır {{is located}} between Kars <b>and</b> Ağrı. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{that it has}} three {{strategically}} important neighbours, the border gate to Armenia is closed {{and there is no}} direct access to Iran, therefore this situation diminishes economic possibilities.|$|R

25|$|Shusterman also {{engages in}} the {{aesthetic}} criticism of particular genres of popular arts {{and of its}} concrete works, arguing for artistic value of country music and rap. What is worth stressing is that Shusterman was probably the first art philosopher ever to write about rap, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the accuracy of his treatment of this music genre is sometimes questioned, his groundbreaking role in this area cannot be denied and has been appreciated worldwide.|$|E
25|$|The etching {{of metals}} with acid {{was known in}} Europe from at least 1400, but the {{elaborate}} decoration of armour, in Germany anyway, was an art probably imported from Italy {{around the end of}} the 15th century—little earlier than the birth of etching as a printmaking technique. Although the first extant dated etchings are the three by Albrecht Dürer of 1515, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that none of his works are dated, stylistic evidence suggests that Daniel Hopfer was using this technology as early as 1500.|$|E
25|$|After the {{enactment}} of the Civil Marriage Act, CIC adopted an interim immigration policy which did not recognize same-sex marriages which took place outside Canada. For example, a Canadian citizen, legally married in the Netherlands to his or her same-sex Dutch partner, might not sponsor his or her Dutch partner for immigration as a spouse, despite the fact that both Dutch law and Canadian law made no distinction between opposite-sex and same-sex civil marriages, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that CIC did recognize a Dutch opposite-sex marriage.|$|E

25|$|Regarding the euro, some {{confusion}} regarding the obverse and reverse {{of the euro}} coins exists. Officially, as agreed by the informal Economic and Finance Ministers Council of Verona in April 1996, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{that a number of}} countries have a different design for each coin, the distinctive national side for the circulation coins is the obverse and the common European side (which includes the coin value) is the reverse. This rule does not apply to the collector coins as they don't have a common side.|$|E
25|$|In late 2007, Iranian {{authorities}} hanged Makwan Mouludzadeh in Kermanshah {{prison for}} crimes he {{is alleged to}} have committed when he was 13 years of age. According to Human Rights Watch, this was despite the fact that his accusers had recanted their statements and Mouladzadeh had repudiated his confession as being coerced by the police, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the head of Iran’s judiciary, Ayatollah Shahrudi, had ordered a unit of the Judiciary to investigate the case and refer it back to the Penal Court of Kermanshah, before any final decision on an execution.|$|E
25|$|Five {{juvenile}} males—four {{black and}} one of Hispanic descent—were tried variously for assault, robbery, riot, rape, sexual abuse, and attempted murder. Based solely on confessions that they said were coerced and false, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that DNA tests on the rape kit excluded them as the source, they were convicted in 1990 by juries in two separate trials. Known as the Central Park Five, they received sentences ranging from 5 to 15 years. Four of the convictions were appealed and the convictions were affirmed by appellate courts. The defendants spent between 6 and 13 years in prison.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with the}} {{recording}} contracts Blackwell was handing out, {{he also wanted}} to make a go-go film and soundtrack; a D.C.-based version of The Harder They Come, perhaps. The resultant film, Good to Go (or Short Fuse, as it was called on video) was plagued with problems: co-director Don Letts was let go halfway through production, the film became less about the music and more about drugs and violence, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that most of the post-production was completed in the fall of 1985, the film was held for release until late-summer 1986. When it did poorly on release, it seemed that go-go had missed its best chance to break into the mainstream.|$|E
25|$|At the Mayor's office, Henry {{breaks in}} to get the maps as Robin stands guard. Instead of finding the map, Henry sees Cruella, who {{explains}} to him that because {{he is now the}} Author, he can bring her back to life, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he broke the Quill, it’s still alive in the Underworld as it has unfinished business to write people's stories. She tells Henry if he helps her escape the Underworld, it will be as if she never died, and therefore, Emma’s soul will be pure again. Unfortunately when Robin asks Henry if he found the map as they leave the office, Henry lies to Robin that he didn’t find anything or anyone.|$|E
25|$|When {{the affair}} was discovered, those {{involved}} (except de La Motte and Réaux de Villette, who both managed to flee) were arrested, tried, convicted, and either imprisoned or exiled. The only one imprisoned was Mme de La Motte, who {{was given a}} life sentence to Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, which {{also served as a}} prison for women. Judged by the Parlement, Rohan was found innocent of any wrongdoing and allowed to leave the Bastille. Marie Antoinette, who had insisted on the arrest of the Cardinal, was dealt a heavy personal blow, as was the monarchy, <b>and</b> <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the guilty parties were tried and convicted, the affair proved to be extremely damaging to her reputation, which never recovered from it.|$|E
