5000|$|The <b>Asia-Pacific</b> <b>Telecommunity</b> (APT) band {{plan is a}} type of {{segmentation}} of the 698-806 MHz band (usually {{referred to}} as the 700 MHz band) formalized by the APT in 2008-2010 and specially configured for the deployment of mobile broadband technologies (e.g. most notably Long Term Evolution, LTE). This segmentation exists in two variants, FDD and TDD, that have been standardized by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and recommended by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) as segmentations A5 and A6, respectively. The APT band plan has been designed to enable the most efficient use of available spectrum. Therefore, this plan divides the band into contiguous blocks of frequencies that are as large as possible taking account of the need to avoid interference with services in other frequency bands. As the result, the TDD option (segmentation A6) includes 100 MHz of continuous spectrum, while the FDD option (segmentation A5) comprises two large blocks, one of 45 MHz for uplink transmission (mobile to network) in {{the lower part of the}} band and the other also of 45 MHz for downlink transmission in the upper part. As defined in the standard, both FDD and TDD schemes for the 700 MHz band include guard bands of 5 MHz and 3 MHz at their lower and upper edges, respectively. The FDD version also includes a center gap of 10 MHz. The guardbands serve the purpose of mitigating interference with adjacent bands while the FDD center gap is required to avoid interference between uplink and downlink transmissions. The two arrangements are shown graphically in figures 1 and 2.Existing 3GPP standards for the APT band plan are given below: ...|$|E

Appearing during the closing months of 2000 was the Okinawa Charter, which lays out some general paths for the G 8 nations to follow in alleviating the digital divide. Also in Tokyo, the <b>Asia-Pacific</b> <b>Telecommunity</b> (APT) held a summit on the information society and issued the Tokyo Declaration. In the Declaration, it mentions that member countries will do their best, in both domestic efforts and through international co-operation, to enable people in the Asia-Pacific region to have access to the Internet by the year 2005 to the greatest extent possible, including access from public facilities such as schools and post offices. There were other international and regional confer-ences, such as the UN Millennium General Assembly and ASEAN, which also laid the paths for bridging digital divide issues. Digital divide issues are about differential access to information and communication tech-nologies. Today, that usually means computers and the Internet. The divide is reflected in some recent ICT data from the UNDPs Agenda 21 : 276 million people worldwide are using the Internet; 200, 000 devices (computers) are being added each day to the Internet; 1. 5 billion web pages have been created; 2 million web pages are being added each day; However, 95 % of the worlds population is not participating in this activity...|$|E
