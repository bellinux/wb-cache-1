5|$|Simple or {{uncomplicated}} malaria may {{be treated}} with oral medications. The most effective treatment for P.falciparum infection {{is the use of}} artemisinins in combination with other antimalarials (known as artemisinin-combination therapy, or ACT), which decreases resistance to any single drug component. These additional antimalarials include: <b>amodiaquine,</b> lumefantrine, mefloquine or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. Another recommended combination is dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine. ACT is about 90% effective when used to treat uncomplicated malaria. To treat malaria during pregnancy, the WHO recommends the use of quinine plus clindamycin early in the pregnancy (1st trimester), and ACT in later stages (2nd and 3rd trimesters). In the 2000s (decade), malaria with partial resistance to artemisins emerged in Southeast Asia. Infection with P.vivax, P.ovale or P.malariae usually do not require hospitalization. Treatment of P.vivax requires both treatment of blood stages (with chloroquine or ACT) and clearance of liver forms with primaquine. Treatment with tafenoquine prevents relapses after confirmed P. vivax malaria.|$|E
25|$|Several fixed-dose ACTs are now {{available}} containing an artemisinin component and a partner drug which has a long half-life, such as mefloquine (ASMQ), lumefantrine (Coartem), <b>amodiaquine</b> (ASAQ), piperaquine (Duo-Cotecxin), and pyronaridine (Pyramax). Increasingly, these combinations are being made to GMP standard. A separate issue concerns the quality of some artemisinin-containing products being sold in Africa and Southeast Asia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amodiaquine</b> is a 4-aminoquinolone anti-malarial drug {{similar in}} {{structure}} and {{mechanism of action}} to chloroquine. <b>Amodiaquine</b> has tended to be administered in areas of chloroquine resistance while some patients prefer its tendency to cause less itching than chloroquine. <b>Amodiaquine</b> is now available in a combined formulation with artesunate (ASAQ) and is among the artemisinin-combination therapies recommended by the World Health Organisation. Combination with sulfadoxine=pyrimethamine is no longer recommended (WHO guidelines 2010).|$|E
50|$|<b>Amodiaquine</b> {{has become}} an {{important}} drug in the combination therapy for malaria treatment in Africa. It is often used in combination with artensunate as a by mouth artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. <b>Amodiaquine</b> has also been found to work against chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strains of malaria.|$|E
50|$|The {{side effects}} of <b>amodiaquine</b> are {{generally}} minor to moderate and {{are similar to those}} of chloroquine. Rarely liver problems or low blood cell levels may occur.

Among <b>amodiaquine</b> users, several rare but {{serious side effects}} have been reported and linked to variants in the CYP2C8 alleles. CYP2C8*1 is characterized as the wild-type allele, which shows an acceptable safety profile, while CYP2C8*2, *3 and *4 all show a range of [...] "poor metabolizer" [...] phenotypes. People who are poor metabolizers of <b>amodiaquine</b> display lower treatment efficacy against malaria, as well as increased toxicity. Several {{studies have been conducted}} to determine the prevalence of CYP2C8 alleles amongst malaria patients in East Africa, and have tentatively shown the variant alleles have significant prevalence in that population. About 3.6% of the population studied showed high risk for a poor reaction to or reduced treatment outcomes when treated with <b>amodiaquine.</b> This information is useful in developing programs of pharmacovigilance in East Africa, and have important clinical considerations for prescribing antimalarial medications in regions with high CYP2C8 variant frequency.|$|E

50|$|IPTi {{using the}} {{antimalarial}} drug sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (S/P) was pioneered in Ifakara, Tanzania in 1999.

50|$|In April 2013, Sanofi {{announced}} {{the launch of}} a production facility in Garessio, Italy, to manufacture the anti-plasmodial drug on a large scale. The partnership {{to create a new}} pharmaceutical manufacturing process was led by PATH’s Drug Development program (through an affiliation with OneWorld Health), with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and based on a modified biosynthetic process for artemisinic acid, initially designed by Jay Keasling at the University of California, Berkeley and optimized by Amyris. The reaction is followed by a photochemical process creating singlet oxygen to obtain the end product. Sanofi expects to produce 25 tons of artemisinin in 2013, ramping up the production to 55-60 tons in 2014. The price per kg will be $350-400, roughly the same as the botanical source. Despite concerns that this equivalent source would lead to the demise of companies, which produce this substance conventionally through extraction of A. annua biomass, an increased supply of this drug will likely produce lower prices and therefore increase the availability for ACTs treatment.

50|$|The most {{effective}} treatment for malaria are ACTs which combine artemisinin with another antimalarial medication. ACTs are {{recommended by the}} World Health Organization (WHO) as first-line treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria and, in 2004, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the largest global funding source for malaria control, began reprogramming all approved grants to procure ACTs in areas {{with high levels of}} drug resistance. However, ACTs account for only one in five antimalarial treatments taken and, until the advent of the Affordable Medicines Facility-malaria (AMFm), were provided almost entirely by the public sector. Over 60 percent of patients in malaria endemic areas access anti-malarial treatment through the private sector but, before the AMFm, the private sector only accounted for about 5 percent of all ACTs provided. ACTs are more expensive than the less-effective first-line malaria treatments, such as chloroquine (CQ), sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) and <b>amodiaquine</b> (AQ), which usually cost less than US$1. Therefore, unsubsidized, quality-assured ACTs are not affordable by {{many of the people who}} need them in malaria-endemic countries. This leads to avoidable complications or death, since people either do not receive treatment or use cheaper, less effective antimalarials. Further, if patients use artemisinin monotherapies, this increases the risk of widespread resistance to artemisinin.|$|E

The difference between the two groups was highly significant. This PMN sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of the drug was not related to intrinsic oxidative metabolism.

Currently, there are few field-adapted analytical techniques for monitoring <b>amodiaquine</b> utilization in patients. This study evaluates the field applicability of a new method to determine <b>amodiaquine</b> and its metabolite concentrations in whole blood dried on filter paper. Methods Twelve patients aged between 1. 5 to 8 years with uncomplicated malaria received three standard oral doses of AQ+AS. Filter paper blood samples were collected before drug intake and at six different time points over 28 days period. A new field-adapted sampling procedure and liquid chromatographic method was used for quantitative determination of <b>amodiaquine</b> and its metabolite in whole blood. Results The sampling procedure was successively applied in the field. <b>Amodiaquine</b> could be quantified for at least three days and the metabolite up to 28 days. All parasites in all the 12 patients cleared within the first three days of treatment and no adverse drug effects were observed. Conclusion The methodology is suitable for field studies.

Children aged between 6 months and 10 years with clinical and parasitological evidence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria were randomized to receive either of cotrimoxazole plus <b>amodiaquine</b> or pyrimethamine-sulphadoxine plus <b>amodiaquine.</b> Ninety seven children (51 and 46, respectively, in the cotrimoxazole plus <b>amodiaquine</b> group and pyrimethamine-sulphadoxine plus <b>amodiaquine</b> group) completed the study per protocol and were evaluated. Pre treatment clinical and parasitological parameters were similar in the 2 treatment groups. The time to clear fever and other symptoms were similar in the two groups 1. 64 ± 0. 98 vs 1. 47 ± 0. 74; p> 0. 05. Parasite clearance times were also similar; 2. 41 ± 0. 67 vs 2. 35 ± 0. 60 days, respectively, for aqct and aqsp; p> 0. 05.
