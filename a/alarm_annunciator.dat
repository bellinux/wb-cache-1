50|$|The {{introduction}} of computer monitor based control systems during the 1980s and 1990s saw a wholesale absorption of alarm window displays {{on to the}} computer screen. This created a down-turn in the sales of the conventional <b>Alarm</b> <b>Annunciator</b> systems {{and many of the}} companies manufacturing these <b>alarm</b> <b>annunciator</b> products were either sold off or went out of business.This has left today a major obsolescence support problem for customers who are still using these <b>Alarm</b> <b>Annunciator</b> systems as part of their safety systems.|$|E

The annunciator panel will indicate the zone and approximate physical location {{of the source of}} a fire alarm in the building. The annunciator will also include lamps and audible warning devices to indicate failures of alarm circuits. In a large building such as an office tower or hotel, the fire annunciator may also be associated with a control panel for building ventilation systems, and may also include emergency communication systems for the building.|$|E

50|$|Columbia {{had four}} decks, {{three of which}} were the Spar deck, Main deck and Hurricane deck. The Spar deck was {{completely}} of iron construction and the Main had a mix of wood and iron. All the decks had iron framing. Columbia had four watertight compartments. She also utilized electric fire <b>alarms</b> and <b>annunciators</b> with several hydrants in case of fire. Electric head and side lights were used for navigation. These navigational lights were powered by an auxiliary dynamo between decks. The navigational electric system was of Hiram Maxim's design where the main electrical systems were Edison's. The bridge and engine room were able to communicate by telegraph. The cargo holds of Columbia were equipped with double steam powered elevators.|$|R
5000|$|Over {{the last}} five years the <b>Alarm</b> <b>Annunciator</b> has seen a {{resurgence}} in popularity especially for use in IEC61508 SIL 1 and SHE (Safety Health and Environmental) alarm monitoring applications. [...] The modern trend is to identify critical alarms and return them from the computer screen to discrete alarm windows. This is being done for two reasons. Firstly, alarm annunciators offer pattern recognition to the operators in the form of LED alarm fascias instead of just providing an exhaustive list of alarms and events which the operators have to scroll through and in some instances alarms can be overlooked. Secondly, the analysis of plant failure modes is leading to the separation of critical alarm monitoring and process control systems for safety reasons.|$|E
40|$|At present, Panel-Based <b>Alarm</b> <b>Annunciator</b> System for the {{existing}} 130 Mev AVF cyclotron of our centre {{is used to}} draw the attention to the operator only for the 64 Nos. of top-level alarms. The lower level faults, which cause the top level alarm, are not visible from the control panel. Moreover, huge amount of maintenance cost and manpower is involved in keeping the system alive. To alleviate these problems, one PC-Based <b>Alarm</b> <b>Annunciator</b> System has been developed using C++ [1] under WIN-NT. A PC plug-in card from ADVANTECH [2] {{is used for the}} Input/Output (I/O) interface. The 64 top level alarms are displayed on the screen using buttons with pre-defined names and different colors are used to indicate the systemâ€™s status; e. g. RED for fault, GREEN for O. K. and BLINKING with AUDIO for alarms. Lower level alarms can be displayed with a mouse click on the top-level alarm button. The system keeps records of different parameters with time stamp in a database. The facility to monitor the on-line status of the alarms over the network, through WWW browser is also incorporated. The system is working satisfactorily and will be connected with the main system shortly. ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a new human-machine (HMI) interface of the VR- 1 nuclear training reactor at the Czech Technical University in Prague. The VR- 1 reactor is primarily used for training of university students and future {{nuclear power plant}} staff. The new HMI was designed to meet functional, ergonomic and aesthetic requirements. It contains a PC with two monitors. The first alphanumerical monitor presents text messages about the reactor operation and status; next, the operator can enter commands to control the reactor operation. The second graphical monitor provides parameters of reactor operation and shows {{the course of the}} reactor power and other parameters. Furthermore, it is able to display the core configuration, perform reactivity calculations, etc. The HMI is also equipped with an <b>alarm</b> <b>annunciator.</b> Due to...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{responsibility}} of an {{intrusion detection system}} (IDS) operator is to monitor the system, assess alarms, and summon and coordinate the response team when a threat is acknowledged. The tools currently provided to the operator are somewhat limited: monitors must be switched, keystrokes must be entered to call up intrusion sensor data, and communication with the response force must be maintained. The Virtual tower is an operator interface assembled from low-cost commercial-off-the-shelf hardware and software; it enables large amounts of data to be displayed in a virtual manner that provides instant recognition for the operator and increases assessment accuracy in <b>alarm</b> <b>annunciator</b> and control systems. This is accomplished by correlating and fusing the data into a 360 -degree visual representation that employs color, auxiliary attributes, video, and directional audio to prompt the operator. The Virtual Tower would be a valuable low-cost enhancement to existing systems...|$|E
40|$|This {{test report}} {{documents}} {{the results obtained}} while conducting operational testing of the sampling equipment in the 225 -WC building, the PFP Wastewater Sampling Facility. The Wastewater Sampling Facility houses equipment to sample and monitor the PFP`s liquid effluents before discharging the stream to the 200 Area Treated Effluent Disposal Facility (TEDF). The majority of the streams are not radioactive and discharges from the PFP Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC). The streams that might be contaminated are processed through the Low Level Waste Treatment Facility (LLWTF) before discharging to TEDF. The sampling equipment consists of two flow-proportional composite samplers, an ultrasonic flowmeter, pH and conductivity monitors, chart recorder, and associated relays and current isolators to interconnect the equipment to allow proper operation. Data signals from the monitors are received in the 234 - 5 Z Shift Office which contains a chart recorder and <b>alarm</b> <b>annunciator</b> panel. The data signals are also duplicated {{and sent to the}} TEDF control room through the Local Control Unit (LCU). Performing the OTP has verified the operability of the PFP wastewater sampling system. This Operability Test Report documents the acceptance of the sampling system for use...|$|E
40|$|A Distributive Process Control {{system was}} {{purchased}} by Project B- 534, `` 242 -A Evaporator/Crystallizer Upgrades``. This control system, called the Monitor and Control System (MCS), was installed in the 242 -A Evaporator located in the 200 East Area. The purpose of the MCS is to monitor and control the Evaporator and monitor a number of alarms and other signals from various Tank Farm facilities. Applications software for the MCS {{was developed by the}} Waste Treatment Systems Engineering (WTSE) group of Westinghouse. The standard displays and alarm scheme provide for control and monitoring, but do not directly indicate the signal location or depict the overall process. To do this, WTSE developed a second alarm scheme which uses special programs, annunciator keys, and process graphics. The special programs are written in two languages; Sequence and Batch Language (SABL), and ``C`` language. The WTSE-developed alarm scheme works as described below: SABL relates signals and <b>alarms</b> to the <b>annunciator</b> keys, called SKID keys. When an alarm occurs, a SABL program causes a SKID key to flash, and if the alarm is of yellow or white priority then a ``C`` program turns on an audible horn (the D/ 3 system uses a different audible horn for the red priority alarms). The horn and flashing key draws the attention of the operator...|$|R
