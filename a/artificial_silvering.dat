Silver fir had only 15, 3 % from total share. Density trees (Scots pine, Douglas fir, silver fir, European beech, Norway spruce, European larch, sessile oak, cherry, white pine) was 16 830 pcs/ha. The higher height increment had sessile oak (70, 1 cm), {{on the other hand}} lower height increment had Norway spruce (19, 6 cm).

40|$|In {{the region}} of Rýchory (KRNAP – the Krkonoše National Park), effects of roe deer and red deer {{browsing}} on the condition and development and natural and artificial regeneration of stands was studied in 2003 – 2004. Winter and summer browsing were observed in 14 couples of plots (always one with mechanical protection, the second without the protection) and in one control couple in a wintering preserve for red deer. In both years, winter browsing predominated {{in the region and}} thus, it is possible to suppose that roe deer was the main browser. As for natural regeneration, silver fir (26 % in winter 2003), rowan (36 % in winter 2003) and sycamore maple (26 % in winter 2004) were the most damaged species. In <b>artificial</b> regeneration, <b>silver</b> fir damage predominated (68 % in winter 2003).

Artificial regeneration was damaged more markedly than natural regeneration in all terms of monitoring.

40|$|Artificial {{structures}} with two- or three-dimensional {{arrangement of}} materials (photonic crystals) are being considered {{in recent days}} a key structure for the fabrication of advanced optical devices {{with the potential to}} substitute present electronics by all-photonic systems in the near future. Special interest has also arisen for their use as chemical sensors and in the fabrication of solar cells. In this work, a fabrication process for <b>silver</b> <b>artificial</b> structures from a colloidal solution of polystyrene spheres is presented. The colloidal spheres are arranged onto a glass substrate to form an artificial opal that is subsequently infiltrated with silver. Additionally, the structural and optical properties of the fabricated structures are studied. The structural characterization of the opals shows good order in the long scale. Reflectance measurements of these samples present a reflection peak centred around 800 nm. SEM images of the silver infiltrated opals show that the infiltration has been carried out successfully. Even so, the optical characterization of the infiltrated samples shows a big intensification of the original reflectivity with a displacement of only few nanometres from the original peak. After the removal of the spheres, the samples show total inversion. © 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} dealing with {{analysis}} and statistical evaluation of regeneration methods introducing silver fir to forests in the area LS Lužná, forest district Bor. The aim of this thesis {{was to make the}} measurements of silver fir plants growing in the existing permanent research plots, to establish new research plots and perform general evaluation of alternative regeneration approaches. The theoretical part deals with the issue of silver fir regeneration, its expansion and areal, ecological requirements, usability and physiological description of this species were also taken into consideration. This part of the thesis was also focused on description of the various alternative ways of reintroducing this species to the forest. It was made a description of the principles of forest tending, natural and <b>artificial</b> regeneration of <b>silver</b> fir stands with respect to its environmental requirements. The biotic and abiotic pests of silver fir and effective defence against these pests were also discussed. It was made the analyses of factors affecting positively and negatively the growth and development of silver fir. Silver fir was described as an ameliorative and stabilizing tree species. In the practical part of this thesis an analysis of local conditions on the ground Bor, LS Lužná; specifically analysis of climate, soil, light and growth conditions was performed. They were recorded and compared to findings on the permanent research plots (established in 2014) and newly established research plots. The results were evaluated by different growth conditions on the research and permanent research plots. The differences in growth conditions in the different regeneration variants were evaluated statistically...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of silver}} nanoparticles (AgNPs) in industry and consumer products results in the increasing environmental concentrations of AgNPs. In the aquatic environment, sediment is the major sink for the AgNPs. The behaviour and toxicity of AgNPs in sediments is largely unknown, and therefore the potential risk to the benthic ecosystems is difficult to predict. The aim of this thesis was to study the toxicity and uptake of uncoated AgNPs (uc-AgNPs) and polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated AgNPs (PVP-AgNPs) to Lumbriculus variegatus in sediment exposures. Also, the association of AgNP-originated dissolved Ag with sediment components was studied using a sequential extraction method. Studies were conducted in natural and <b>artificial</b> sediments using <b>silver</b> nitrate (AgNO 3) as a positive control for the toxicity and behaviour of silver ions (Ag+). The toxicity of AgNPs was lower than toxicity of AgNO 3 in all the tested sediments. The properties of both the sediment and AgNPs were found to influence the environmental behaviour of AgNPs. The PVP-coating on AgNPs increased the bioaccumulation of Ag in alkaline artificial and natural sediments, whereas the bioaccumulation of uc-AgNPs was low. The toxicity of uc-AgNPs and PVP-AgNPs was comparably enhanced in acidic artificial sediment. Firstly, the dissolution of AgNPs was increased by low pH and secondly, the toxicity of Ag+ was further enhanced in acidic sediment. AgNP-originated dissolved Ag was observed to associate strongly with the sediment components, and only {{a small proportion of}} Ag was bioaccessible. The bioaccessibility differed among the sediments and was higher with PVP-AgNPs than uc-AgNPs. The toxicity of AgNPs seemed to be a function of Ag+ and no nano-specific toxicity was observed. According to our findings, the acute toxicity of AgNPs to L. varigatus is not expected to be higher than the toxicity of AgNO 3...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} simplified dehydration protocols, {{in the absence of}} tubular occlusion, on bond strength and interfacial nanoleakage of a hydrophobic experimental adhesive blend to acid-etched, ethanol-dehydrated dentine immediately and after 6 months. Methods: Molars were randomly assigned to 6 treatment groups (n = 5). Under pulpal pressure simulation, dentine crowns were acid-etched with 35 % H(3) PO(4) and rinsed with water. Adper Scotchbond Multi-Purpose was used for the control group. The remaining groups had their dentine surface dehydrated with ethanol solutions: group 1 = 50 %, 70 %, 80 %, 95 % and 3 x 100 %, 30 s for each application; group 2 the same ethanol sequence with 15 s for each solution; groups 3, 4 and 5 used 100 % ethanol only, applied in seven, three or one 30 s step, respectively. After dehydration, a primer (50 % BisGMA + TEGDMA, 50 % ethanol) was used, followed by the neat comonomer adhesive application. Resin composite build-ups were then prepared using an incremental technique. Specimens were stored for 24 h, sectioned into beams and stressed to failure after 24 h or after 6 months of <b>artificial</b> ageing. Interfacial <b>silver</b> leakage evaluation was performed for both storage periods (n = 5 per subgroup). Results: Group 1 showed higher bond strengths at 24 h or after 6 months of ageing (45. 6 +/- 5. 9 (a) / 43. 1 +/- 3. 2 (a) MPa) and lower silver impregnation. Bond strength results were statistically similar to control group (41. 2 +/- 3. 3 (ab) / 38. 3 +/- 4. 0 (ab) MPa), group 2 (40. 0 +/- 3. 1 (ab) / 38. 6 +/- 3. 2 (ab) MPa), and group 3 at 24 h (35. 5 +/- 4. 3 (ab) MPa). Groups 4 (34. 6 +/- 5. 7 (bc) / 25. 9 +/- 4. 1 (c) MPa) and 5 (24. 7 +/- 4. 9 (c) / 18. 2 +/- 4. 2 (c) MPa) resulted in lower bond strengths, extensive interfacial nanoleakage and more prominent reductions (up to 25 %) in bond strengths after 6 months of ageing. Conclusions: Simplified dehydration protocols using one or three 100 % ethanol applications should be avoided for the ethanol-wet bonding technique in the absence of tubular occlusion, as they showed decreased bond strength, more severe nanoleakage and reduced bond stability over time.
