5|$|In January 2002, Mustaine {{was hospitalized}} {{for the removal}} of a kidney stone and was {{administered}} pain medication that triggered a relapse of his drug addiction. Following his stay, Mustaine checked himself into a treatment center in Texas, where he suffered a peculiar injury causing severe nerve damage to his left arm. The injury, induced by falling <b>asleep</b> <b>with</b> his left arm over the back of a chair, caused compression of the radial nerve. He was diagnosed with radial neuropathy, which left him unable to grasp or even make a fist with his left hand.|$|E

Ann {{suggests}} that Leslie get some sleep, but she plans on consuming Sweetums bars to stay awake for another 24 hours. As the telethon begins, Leslie is already exhausted and is falling <b>asleep.</b> <b>With</b> time to kill, Tom brings Detlef to the Snakehole Lounge, but the owner, Freddy (Andy Milder), refuses to let him go because Detlef is bringing a lot of business, delaying Leslie's big headliner. Andy's (Chris Pratt) band, Mouse Rat, is asked to replace Detlef, but when they complete all of their songs, Leslie has nothing else to put on the air.

25|$|Bruno Bettelheim {{notes in}} The Uses of Enchantment that the 18th-century fairy tale Beauty and the Beast is {{a version of}} Cupid and Psyche. Motifs from Apuleius occur in several fairy tales, {{including}} Cinderella and Rumpelstiltskin, in versions collected by folklorists trained in the classical tradition, such as Charles Perrault and the Grimm brothers. In the Grimm version, Cinderella is given the task of sorting lentils and peas from ash, and is aided by birds just as ants help Psyche in the sorting of grain and legumes imposed on her by Venus. Like Cinderella, Psyche has two envious sisters who compete with her for the most desirable male. Cinderella's sisters mutilate their own feet to emulate her, while Psyche's are dashed to death on a rocky cliff. In Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid, the Little Mermaid is given a dagger by her sisters, who, {{in an attempt to}} end all the suffering she endured and to let her become a mermaid again, attempt to persuade her to use it to slay the Prince while he is <b>asleep</b> <b>with</b> his new bride. She cannot bring herself to kill the Prince, however. Unlike Psyche, who becomes immortal, she doesn't receive his love in return, but she, nevertheless, ultimately earns the eternal soul she yearns for.|$|E

For this song, however, he was half awake when he {{imagined}} it, and thought, [...] "Boy that's good. I need to finish that. Too bad things don't happen in my dreams."

500|$|Nebe {{decided to}} try experimenting by murdering Soviet mental patients, first with {{explosives}} near Minsk, and then with automobile exhaust at Mogilev. The idea of using gas was partly inspired by an incident in Nebe's past. One night after a party, Nebe had driven home drunk, parked in his garage, and fallen <b>asleep</b> <b>with</b> the engine running, thus nearly dying of carbon monoxide poisoning from the exhaust fumes. To conduct the experiments, he ordered chemist Albert Widmann, {{a member of the}} criminal-technical institute of the RKPA, to come to Minsk with [...] of explosives and exhaust hoses. The next day Widmann, Nebe, and an explosives expert carried out their first experiment in prepared bunkers in the Minsk area. According to testimony presented at Widmann's postwar trial: ...|$|E

500|$|Egg-laying {{starts in}} April in more southerly colonies but seldom occurs before June in Greenland. The female lays a single white egg each year {{but if this}} is lost early in the {{breeding}} season, another might be produced. Synchronous laying of eggs is found in Atlantic puffins in adjacent burrows. The egg is large compared {{to the size of the}} bird, averaging [...] long by [...] wide and weighing about [...] The white shell is usually devoid of markings but soon becomes soiled with mud. The incubation responsibilities are shared by both parents. They each have two feather-free brood patches on their undersides where an enhanced blood supply provides heat for the egg. The parent on incubation duty in the dark nest chamber spends much of its time <b>asleep</b> <b>with</b> its head tucked under its wing, occasionally emerging from the tunnel to flap dust out of its feathers or take a short flight down to the sea.|$|E
500|$|The Word for World is Forest {{shares the}} theme of dreaming with the later Le Guin novel The Lathe of Heaven. Suzanne Reid stated that the novel {{examines}} the source and effect of dreams. The Athsheans teach themselves to consciously and actively control their dreams. This allows them to access their subconscious {{in a way that}} the Terrans are not able. The Athsheans follow a polycyclic sleep pattern with a period of 120 minutes, which makes it impossible for them to adapt to the Terran eight-hour work day. Their dreaming is not restricted to times when they are <b>asleep,</b> <b>with</b> adept dreamers being able to dream while wide awake as well. [...] The visions they see while dreaming direct and shape their waking behavior, which Selver describes as [...] "balanc your sanity... on the double support, the fine balance, of reason and dream; once you have learned that, you cannot unlearn it any more than you can unlearn to think." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{trying and}} failing to find work in New Hampshire, in 1833 Wilson walked {{more than one hundred}} miles to Natick, Massachusetts seeking {{employment}} or a trade. Having met William P. Legro, a shoemaker who was willing to train him, Wilson hired himself out for five months to learn to make leather shoes called brogans. [...] Wilson learned the trade in a few weeks, bought out his employment contract for $15, and opened his own shop, intending to save enough money to study law. Wilson had success as a shoemaker, and was able to save several hundred dollars in a relatively short time. [...] This success gave rise to legends about Wilson's skill; according to one story that grew with retelling, he once attempted to make one hundred pairs of shoes without sleeping, and fell <b>asleep</b> <b>with</b> the one hundredth pair in his hand. [...] Wilson's shoe making experience {{led to the creation of}} the political nicknames his supporters later used to highlight his working class roots—the [...] "Natick Cobbler" [...] and the [...] "Natick Shoemaker".|$|E

500|$|... "Don't You Wanna Stay" [...] is {{a country}} pop song with a length of four minutes and sixteen seconds. It {{incorporates}} melancholic guitar riff which is accompanied by classical elements such as violin. Mikael Wood of Billboard described the song as [...] "a dramatic, slow building power ballad {{in the style of}} Bonnie Tyler's [...] "Total Eclipse of the Heart"", a view held similar by John Hill of About.com who considered the song as a [...] "classic power ballad", writing [...] "whether you want to call the song country, pop, or something in between doesn't matter because the chorus is so catchy that it doesn't matter if you use an electric guitar or a steel guitar." [...] It is set in common time and has a steady tempo of 72 beats per minute. It is written in the key of G-sharp minor and both Aldean and Clarkson's vocals span two octaves, from A♯3 to G♯5. It follows the chord progression G♯m–E–B. Bob Peacock of Roughstock thought that the structure of the song was interesting with its brief four-line verses and [...] "don't you wanna stay's throughout the chorus.

A paper presented to the Society of Clinical Psychologists hypothesized that Jackson had Asperger syndrome, although other possible explanations, such as a herniated diaphragm, exist. Indeed, Jackson suffered a number of ailments, for which he sought relief via contemporary practices of his day including hydrotherapy, popular in America at that time, visiting establishments at Oswego, New York (1850) and Round Hill, Massachusetts (1860) although with little evidence of success. Jackson also suffered a significant hearing loss in both of his ears {{as a result of his}} prior service in the U.S. Army, as an artillery officer.|$|E
2500|$|On November 22, 2011, Toni Annette Medrano accidentally {{killed her}} 3-week-old son, Adrian Alexander Medrano, {{while she was}} {{sleeping}} {{on the couch with}} him. According to the criminal complaint, Medrano told police she had consumed almost an entire fifth of vodka the night before her son died and fell <b>asleep</b> <b>with</b> him on a couch. The following morning, she woke up and found her infant son unresponsive and cold to the touch. While Grace was covering the case, she infamously dubbed Medrano [...] "Vodka Mom". During one of her shows, Grace brought a bottle of vodka onto her set and poured shots to demonstrate how much Medrano had drunk the night of her son's death. In June 2012, Medrano was charged with two counts of second-degree manslaughter. If convicted on both counts, Medrano would have faced a maximum of ten years in prison.|$|E
