5|$|Thanks to {{its rich}} heritage, which {{includes}} the renowned Humanist Library and an imposing pair of medieval churches, Sélestat is an important tourist destination in <b>Alsace.</b> It also benefits from its location on the <b>Alsace</b> wine road and its proximity to Haut-Kœnigsbourg castle. Aside from the medieval old town, the commune of Sélestat encompasses a nature reserve including {{one of the largest}} riparian forests of France.|$|E
5|$|The town {{is served}} by the A35 autoroute, a {{motorway}} that crosses <b>Alsace</b> north to south, connecting Strasbourg, Colmar and Mulhouse. Further south it connects to the Swiss A3 motorway, and further north to the German B9 highway. Taken together, these three roads connect the Netherlands to Austria. Sélestat is also located {{at one of the}} seven crossings of the Vosges mountains, connecting Lorraine to <b>Alsace</b> and Germany.|$|E
5|$|A map of Kintzheim in <b>Alsace</b> from 1348 {{contains}} the text zu dem Russelinge, {{but it is}} not certain that this reference is to the grape variety. However, in 1477, Riesling was documented in <b>Alsace</b> under the spelling Rissling. In Wachau in Austria, there is a small stream and a small vineyard both called Ritzling, which are claimed locally to have given Riesling its name. However, {{there seems to be no}} documentary evidence to back this up, so this claim is not widely believed to be correct.|$|E
5|$|At Reims, Julian {{showed his}} {{characteristic}} boldness by deciding, in conference with his senior commanders, {{to deal with}} the Alamanni problem at source by marching straight to <b>Alsace</b> and restoring Roman control of the region. On the way, however, his army was ambushed and nearly destroyed at Decem Pagi (Dieuze) by a large German band who fell on two rearguard legions which had lost contact {{with the rest of the}} column in dense mist. They were rescued by auxilia palatina regiments that heard the uproar. Proceeding to Brotomagus (Brumath) in <b>Alsace,</b> Julian's army routed another German band in the field.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its small}} size, Sélestat is well {{connected}} to transport networks. <b>Alsace</b> as a whole, {{being part of}} the economic heart of Europe, has a high road and railway density.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Muscat, Gewürztraminer and Pinot gris, Riesling {{is one of}} the acceptable varieties whose planting is allowed in <b>Alsace</b> grand cru sites.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{probably}} {{in the vicinity of}} Strasbourg, the vanguard of Barbatio's army was ambushed by a strong German force as it approached the camp of Julian's deputy, Severus, who was apparently operating separately from Julian. The vanguard fled in disarray, and, instead of engaging, Barbatio led the rest of his force in a hasty retreat, under close pursuit by the Germans, out of <b>Alsace</b> and a good way into Raetia, in the process losing most of his sutlers, pack-animals and baggage. Then Barbatio, whose cooperation with Julian had been reluctant at best, withdrew his army from the theatre of operations altogether, without Julian's permission. He sent his forces across the Alps into winter-quarters in Italy, despite it being the middle of the campaigning season and the Alamanni being far from defeated or ejected from <b>Alsace.</b> This reduced Roman forces in <b>Alsace</b> by two-thirds and effectively sabotaged the pincer strategy. It is uncertain whether Constantius instigated Barbatio's actions, but it seems unlikely that the magister would have risked breaking off operations unless confident of the emperor's approval.|$|E
5|$|Sélestat <b>Alsace</b> Handball is a noted French {{handball}} club. It {{was founded}} in 1967. FC Sélestat, the football club, {{was founded in}} 1906.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alsace</b> {{in general}} is a stronghold of the French right. The main French right-wing party, The Republicans, {{currently}} holds a large majority in the council (26 councillors). Marcel Bauer, who has been mayor since 2001, {{is also a member}} of that party. Voters in Sélestat generally favour right-wing candidates at other elections as well, although Sélestat was governed by the Socialist Party between 1989 and 2001.|$|E
5|$|As of the 2013 census, Sélestat had 19,332 inhabitants. It is the 8th most {{populated}} commune in <b>Alsace,</b> having {{reached its}} maximum population in 2006, with 19,459 inhabitants. The oldest preserved birth registries of the town's Catholic parish {{go back to}} the year 1608; the oldest vital records (état civil) {{go back to the}} year 1793.|$|E
5|$|Eugene Debs {{was born}} on November 5, 1855, in Terre Haute, Indiana, to Jean Daniel and Marguerite Mari (Bettrich) Debs, who immigrated to the United States from Colmar, <b>Alsace,</b> France. His father, who came from a prosperous family, owned a textile mill and meat market. Debs was named after the French authors Eugène Sue and Victor Hugo.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Sélestat {{had a total}} {{population}} of 19,332, which makes it the eighth most populous town in <b>Alsace.</b> During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance {{it was the third}} largest city in the region, after Strasbourg and Colmar, and it is ranked the third commune in <b>Alsace</b> for cultural heritage. Sélestat was founded in the 8th century as a port on the Ill and it experienced a long period of prosperity thanks to the trade in wine and a thriving religious and cultural life. It gradually declined after the Reformation and the French conquest in the 17th century. The town eventually experienced a new demographic growth {{in the second half of}} the 20th century when it became a small industrial and cultural centre.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{architecture}} {{the city is}} one of the richest and most varied among the smaller cities of <b>Alsace.</b> Although it is only the 8th most populous town in the region, it has the third largest cultural heritage after Strasbourg and Colmar. Sélestat has 35 listed buildings and 119 additional sites that are indexed in the French list of cultural heritage monuments.|$|E
5|$|Julian {{now turned}} his {{attention}} to rebuilding the fortress at Tres Tabernae (Saverne), which had been destroyed by the Alamanni. Saverne lay astride the Mediomatrici (Metz) - Strasbourg Roman highway, {{at the mouth of the}} main entry route through the Vosges mountains into northern <b>Alsace,</b> a location with commanding heights overlooking the Rhine valley.|$|E
5|$|Sélestat {{also has}} a museum {{dedicated}} to bread and baking {{and it is the}} seat of the FRAC d'Alsace, a regional institution whose aim is to collect contemporary works of art (see below, Cultural institutions and events). These works are regularly part of temporary exhibits in Sélestat and other places in <b>Alsace.</b> FRAC possesses works by Aurélie Nemours, Olivier Debré, Mario Merz and Panamarenko, among other artists.|$|E
5|$|Sélestat is {{a member}} of a {{federation}} of communes with shared competencies: the Communauté de communes de Sélestat. Sélestat is its main town, and it includes 11 neighbouring villages. It was created in 1995 to replace an older but similar structure founded in 1969. Sélestat is also the seat of the Central <b>Alsace</b> pays, a structure aiming at developing the area.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Strasbourg, {{also known}} as the Battle of Argentoratum, was fought in AD 357 between the Western Roman army under the Caesar (deputy emperor) Julian and the Alamanni tribal {{confederation}} led by the joint paramount king Chnodomar. The battle took place near Strasbourg (<b>Alsace,</b> France), called Argentoratum in Ammianus Marcellinus' account, Argentorate in the Tabula Peutingeriana (Section 2).|$|E
5|$|The {{library is}} open to both {{researchers}} and tourists, with an exhibition displaying {{some of its most}} noteworthy items: an 8th-century lectionary, the first books printed in <b>Alsace,</b> a copy of the Cosmographiae Introductio where the oldest mention of America can be found, and a 1521 document which contains the oldest record of a Christmas tree.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} {{indicator of}} Chnodomar's numbers is size of forces considered necessary by the Roman government {{to deal with}} the Alamanni threat in Gaul: 40,000 (Julian's 15,000 plus Barbatio's 25,000). Assuming that the Roman military planners would have sought a 2 to 1 superiority to guarantee success, that would imply an Alamannic strength in <b>Alsace</b> of about 20,000. On the basis of these indicators, the midpoint between the recent estimate and Ammianus' figure, 25,000, would seem plausible.|$|E
5|$|Any large {{project was}} further delayed by the Franco-Prussian War, in which Bartholdi {{served as a}} major of militia. In the war, Napoleon III was {{captured}} and deposed. Bartholdi's home province of <b>Alsace</b> was lost to the Prussians, and a more liberal republic was installed in France. As Bartholdi had been planning {{a trip to the}} United States, he and Laboulaye decided the time was right to discuss the idea with influential Americans. In June 1871, Bartholdi crossed the Atlantic, with letters of introduction signed by Laboulaye.|$|E
5|$|Basel had {{remained}} studiously neutral {{throughout the whole}} war. Although allied with some cantons of the Swiss Confederacy, it also had strong economic ties in the <b>Alsace</b> and further down along the Rhine. But {{the events of the}} war had strengthened the pro-confederate party in the city council, and the Swiss recognized the city's strategic position as a bridgehead on the Rhine (like Schaffhausen, too). On June 9, 1501, a delegation from Basel and the Swiss cantons' representatives signed the alliance contract, which the city council of Basel ratified on July 13, 1501.|$|E
5|$|During the 17th century, <b>Alsace</b> {{was one of}} {{the main}} battlefields of the Thirty Years War. Sélestat was seized by the Swedes in 1632 after a month-long siege. They {{surrendered}} the town to their French allies two years later. The local population long remained predominantly faithful to the House of Habsburg. The Peace of Westphalia (1648) formalised the annexation of the Decapolis by France. Sélestat was briefly occupied by the Germans during the Franco-Dutch War in 1674. The Treaties of Nijmegen (1679) that ended the war also abolished the Decapolis.|$|E
5|$|For the 357 {{campaign}} season, a {{plan was}} laid down at Constantius' headquarters in Mediolanum (Milan) to trap the Alamanni in eastern Gaul in a pincer movement. Julian would advance eastward from Reims, while the {{major part of}} Constantius' comitatus in Italy (25,000 strong) was despatched under magister peditum (field marshal) Barbatio to Augusta Rauracorum (Augst) in Raetia, from which he was to advance northward to meet Julian. The Alamanni bands would be cornered and destroyed {{in the southern part}} of Germania I province (<b>Alsace).</b>|$|E
5|$|Helene Bresslau Schweitzer {{was born}} to the Bresslau family on January 25, 1879 in Berlin. Her {{maternal}} family was of Jewish descent, but she was baptized into the Christian religion {{as a result of}} widespread anti-semitism. The Bresslaus moved to <b>Alsace,</b> France when she was eleven because of a new job opportunity for her father. Her father, Harry Bresslau, began working at the University of Strasbourg and eventually became chancellor. As a result of the move, Schweitzer adopted French, becoming fluent rather quickly.|$|E
5|$|On 14 November 2015, a TGV train derailed in Eckwersheim, <b>Alsace,</b> France, while {{performing}} commissioning trials {{on the second}} phase of the LGV Est high-speed rail line, which was scheduled to open for commercial service five months later. The derailment resulted in 11 deaths among those aboard, while the 42 others aboard the train were injured. It was the first fatal derailment in the history of the TGV and the third derailment since the TGV entered commercial service in 1981.|$|E
5|$|On 6 June 1944 the Western Allied armies {{landed in}} {{northern}} France during Operation Overlord. In response, Army Group Upper Rhine (Heeresgruppe Oberrhein) group {{was formed to}} engage the advancing US 7th Army (under command of General Alexander Patch) and French 1st Army (led by General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny) in the <b>Alsace</b> region along {{the west bank of}} the Rhine. In late 1944, Hitler appointed Himmler commander-in-chief of Army Group Upper Rhine.|$|E
5|$|Riesling {{is almost}} never {{fermented}} or aged in new oak (although large old oak barrels {{are often used}} to store and stabilize Riesling based wines in Germany and <b>Alsace).</b> This means that Riesling tends to be lighter weight and therefore suitable to {{a wider range of}} foods. The sharp acidity/sweetness in Rieslings can serve as a good balance to foods that have a high salt content. In Germany, cabbage is sometimes cooked with riesling to reduce the vegetable's smell.|$|E
5|$|The French crusaders had {{departed}} from Metz in June 1147, led by Louis, Thierry of <b>Alsace,</b> Renaut I of Bar, Amadeus III, Count of Savoy and his half-brother William V of Montferrat, William VII of Auvergne, and others, along with armies from Lorraine, Brittany, Burgundy and Aquitaine. A force from Provence, led by Alphonse of Toulouse, chose {{to wait until}} August, and to cross by sea. At Worms, Louis joined with crusaders from Normandy and England.|$|E
5|$|The {{demographic}} {{growth that}} occurred in Sélestat after 1945 was primarily due to a relatively high birth rate (20.1‰ in Sélestat over the period 1968–1975, compared to 16.9‰ in France). After 1975, this rate progressively declined to match the national figure. Net migration figures remained slightly negative until 1990 because Sélestat and Central <b>Alsace</b> were {{on the margins of}} the metropolitan areas of Strasbourg and Colmar and lacked attractivity. Since 1990, the Strasbourg area greatly expanded to gradually reach Sélestat. The town has thus become more attractive to newcomers.|$|E
5|$|To {{isolate the}} Danube from any Allied intervention, Marshal Villeroi's 46,000 troops were {{expected}} to pin the 70,000 Dutch and English troops around Maastricht in the Low Countries, while General de Coigny protected <b>Alsace</b> against surprise with a further corps. The only forces immediately available for Vienna's defence were Prince Louis of Baden's force of 36,000 stationed in the Lines of Stollhofen to watch Marshal Tallard at Strasbourg; {{there was also a}} weak force of 10,000 men under Field Marshal Count Limburg Styrum observing Ulm.|$|E
5|$|A {{skeleton}} {{collection was}} obtained from among a pool of 115 Jewish Auschwitz inmates, chosen for their perceived stereotypical racial characteristics. Rudolf Brandt and Wolfram Sievers, {{general manager of the}} Ahnenerbe (a Nazi research institute), were responsible for delivering the skeletons to the collection of the Anatomy Institute at the Reich University of Strasbourg in the <b>Alsace</b> region of Occupied France. The collection was sanctioned by Himmler and under the direction of August Hirt. Ultimately 87 of the inmates were shipped to Natzweiler-Struthof and killed in August 1943. Brandt and Sievers were later convicted in the Doctors' Trial in Nuremberg.|$|E
5|$|Adolphus Louis de Barth Walbach (November 1, 1764 – October 13, 1844), {{commonly}} known as Louis de Barth, was a Roman Catholic priest in Pennsylvania and Maryland. Born and raised in <b>Alsace,</b> he emigrated {{with his family to}} the United States during the French Revolution. He spent {{the rest of his life}} as a priest there, mostly at Conewago Chapel in rural Pennsylvania. After the Bishop of Philadelphia died in 1814, de Barth temporarily led the diocese as apostolic administrator until a new bishop arrived in 1820. After several years at a German-speaking Baltimore parish, he retired to Washington, D.C., in 1841 and died there three years later.|$|E
5|$|After {{the return}} of <b>Alsace</b> to French rule in 1918, the new {{director}} of the Musée des beaux-arts and the Musée des arts décoratifs, Hans Haug (1890–1965), put major efforts into presenting the Palais Rohan as a coherent whole again. Strasbourg suffered during World War II, and on 11August 1944 the palace was damaged by British and American bombs. After the war, restoration measures were soon undertaken {{under the supervision of}} the architects Robert Danis (1879–1949) and Bertrand Monnet (1910–1989), but in 1947 a fire broke out and devastated a significant part of the collections of the Museum of Fine Arts. This fire was an indirect consequence of the bombing raids: because of the destruction inflicted on the palace, the building had suffered from damp, which was treated with welding torches, and poor handling of these caused the fire.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2010, Sélestat had 1,823 businesses, most of them (1,240) in the {{tertiary}} sector. A {{large share}} were small businesses; only 10% had more than 10 employees. Sélestat is a retail and services centre for the whole Central <b>Alsace,</b> with a large shopping park and administrative and educational institutions. Industry is nonetheless represented by some large firms, such as the Société alsacienne de meubles, which builds kitchens and bathrooms under a Schmidt and Cuisinella franchise, Amcor (aluminium packaging), Daramic (battery separators), Albany (gauzes for the printing industry), Wanzl (warehouse material), and DHJ (textiles).|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} August, 1916, Döblin {{was awarded}} the Fontane Prize (including a {{monetary}} award of 600 Marks) for The Three Leaps of Wang Lun (Die drei Sprünge des Wang-lun). Following this recognition, Döblin set himself {{to work on his}} historical novel Wallenstein, set during the Thirty Years' War. Döblin had to interrupt work on the novel in March 1917 because he had caught typhus, but was able to use the university library at Heidelberg during his convalescence in April and May to continue researching the Thirty Years' War. Back in Saargemünd he came into conflict with his superiors due to the poor treatment of the patients; on 2 August 1917 he was transferred to Hagenau (Haguenau) in <b>Alsace,</b> where the library of nearby Strassbourg helped complete Wallenstein by the beginning of 1919.|$|E
5|$|But, after {{assessing}} {{the situation in}} <b>Alsace,</b> Julian evidently decided that his force was insufficient to prevail over the Alamanni alone. Instead, {{he set out to}} recover Cologne. From Metz, he led his army via Treviri (Trier) to Roman-held Koblenz and thence along the Rhine to Cologne. Entering the ruined city unopposed, Julian's men were set to work to rebuild the city walls. Julian then concluded a peace treaty with the Franks. This had the important result of removing half the opposition from the equation and allowing Julian to focus his resources on dealing with the Alamanni.|$|E
