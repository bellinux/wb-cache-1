40|$|Background: The first {{influenza}} pandemic in the 21 st century, the past 2009 {{influenza pandemic}} (pdmH 1 N 1), {{was caused by}} a novel H 1 N 1 influenza virus. The virus was first described in April 2009 and is now believed to emerge from re-assortment of bird, pig and human flu viruses. Although this pandemic was relatively mild compared to the past pandemics, better knowledge about its characteristics in transmission dynamics and severity is still of public health interest in order to better prepare for future pandemics. Data: Clinical surveillance data were obtained from eFlu database maintained by Hong Kong Hospital Authority. Information was extracted from all pdmH 1 N 1 virologically confirmed infections (which were all symptomatic) about their dates of symptom onset, and, if <b>applicable,</b> <b>dates</b> of hospitalization, ICU admission and death. Serological data were obtained from various sources: 1) community cross-sectional serological survey; 2) convalescent serological data (from symptomatic and virologically confirmed infections); and 3) serological response kinetics data (from symptomatic and virologically confirmed infections). These serological data combined described serological responses against pdmH 1 N 1 infections in the Hong Kong population from different aspects. Methods: I constructed an age-structured natural history model to mimic the pdmH 1 N 1 transmission dynamics in Hong Kong. The transmission model was linked to hospitalization and serology in order to match the observed data. Based on all the data comprehensively, characteristic transmission parameters (basic reproductive number R 0, mean generation time E(Tg), attack rates etc.) in the model were estimated using likelihood-based statistical inferences by Bayesian inference with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Results: I estimated that R 0 is 1. 37 and E(Tg) is 2. 16 days, which are both comparable to seasonal flu. Younger age groups < 20 years were found to be more susceptible (2. 72 times compared to 20 - 29 age group) to pdmH 1 N 1 infection but older age groups 30 - 59 years were less susceptible (0. 55 times). School closure reduced 0 - 12 year olds’ within-age-group transmission effectively during the reactive kindergarten and primary school closure from Jun 10 to Jul 9 by 93 %. Summer holidays from Jun 10 to Aug 31 also reduced within-group transmission by 65 % and 13 % for 0 - 12 and 13 - 19 years olds respectively. Estimates of infection hospitalization probabilities ranged from 0. 2 % to 0. 9 % across age groups. I found that not all infected individuals would have serological response strong enough to be positive in serological test but younger age groups {{were more likely to have}} stronger serological response after infection. Conclusions: Clinical surveillance data have been used to estimate the transmission dynamics of pdmH 1 N 1 in 2009. Here, I combined hospitalization surveillance data with serological data collected throughout the first pandemic wave (April to December 2009) from different sources, which could better characterize the transmission dynamics and severity of pdmH 1 N 1 in Hong Kong. Although further validation is needed, serological surveillance should be considered as a supplementary alternative to clinical surveillance in influenza surveillance. published_or_final_versionCommunity MedicineMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E

We sought to estimate the frequency and prognostic impact of AF in patients with bacteremia, and to study the possible association between AF and C-reactive protein (CRP) in this population. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated patient-charts of patients with bacteremia with E. coli or S. pneumoniae admitted to Aker Universitiy Hospital in Oslo throughout the period 1994 to 2004. Variables on known cardiac risk factors for AF, signs of AF, mode of conversion of AF, and, if <b>applicable,</b> <b>date</b> of death, were registered. Initial CRP values were categorized into 4 strata. Odds ratios (ORs) of the 3 highest CRP categories compared with the lowest ones were obtained from logistic models adjusting for known cardiac risk factors for AF. Cox regression {{analysis was used to}} compare new-onset AF and death during the first two weeks after hospitalization. Results: 677 patient charts were studied. 104 patients (15. 4 %) had new-onset AF. Peak incidence of new-onset AF occurred on the day of admission. Peak CRP values were reached during the two next days. High CRP level at admission did not predict the occurrence of AF. The observed mortality was higher among patients with new-onset AF (p= 0. 04) during the first two weeks after hospitalization. Conclusions: The frequency of new-onset AF in bacteremia is substantial. Initial CRP levels do not predict new-onset AF. In patients with bacteremia, new-onset AF is associated with increased mortality. Keywords: C-reactive protein / atrial fibrillation / bacteremia / inflammation / arrhythmia / huma...|$|R
