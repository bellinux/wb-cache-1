5000|$|Powder-{{coated steel}}: Powder coated steel benches are often found lining entryways for {{different}} venues, like retail centers, medical facilities and country clubs. While powder-coat {{is a common}} finish on many commercial site furnishings, it is often featured on strap metal benches because of its <b>anti-corrosive</b> <b>qualities</b> and ability to strongly bond to heavy duty steel constructions. Powder-coated benches also {{come in a variety}} of colors and designs, from classic strap metal benches to extremely intricate designs.|$|E
40|$|Electrochemical-assisted {{deposition}} {{was used}} to treat AZ 31 B magnesium alloy with silanes. The effects of additive amounts of Î³-(methacryloxy) propyltrimethoxysilane (KH- 570) on quality and corrosion resistance of the formed films were studied by the potentiodynamic polarization curve, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and so forth. Besides, films in this research were modified by hydroxyapatite (HA) and cerium ion (Ce 3 +) and then the films' <b>anti-corrosive</b> <b>quality</b> were studied. The results show that a uniform, dense silane transparent film is formed on AZ 31 B magnesium alloy after silane electrochemical-assisted deposition, which hinders corrosion behaviors of magnesium alloy effectively and reduces the corrosion current density to a great extent; there is an optimum volume of KH- 570 in silane electrochemical-assisted deposition, and the best film can be got when 8 mL KH- 570 is added; the quality of film formed by electrochemical-assisted depositing KH- 570 can be improved further through modifying silane solutions...|$|R
