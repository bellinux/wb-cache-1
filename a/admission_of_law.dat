Part I of this article begins with {{an introduction to the}} ethics issues arising in connection with the <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> students. Part II focuses on different purposes served by criminal background questions on the law school admission application, including screening applicants’ fitness to practice law. Part III considers the various ways law schools handle applicants’ nondisclosure and expands on the benefits of a modified amnesty program. Part IV explores how criminal background inquiries differ in depth, spanning from questions asking about criminal convictions to questions covering criminal charges, and how these inquiries may reflect a socio-economic bias. Part V details the advantages lawyers can provide applicants regarding disclosure. The article concludes by recommending measures law schools can take to effectively employ criminal background inquiries while simultaneously limiting any socio-economic bias...|$|E

40|$|Preferential admissions {{standards}} do {{not significantly}} increase {{the total number}} of minority students able to obtain a legal education. Because the <b>admissions</b> standards <b>of</b> <b>law</b> schools form a continuum of acceptable LSAT scores and undergraduate grade averages, moving down a sliding scale, a student preferentially admitted to a highly selective school would be admissible under the normal standards of a less selective school. The only possible gain is among those minority students not normally admissible by the minimum standards of the least selective schools. There has been no showing that it is necessary or desirable to reduce the admissions standards {{at the lower end of}} the scale. Preferential admissions, the author contends, do not increase the opportunities for legal education of minority students, but instead create handicaps to professional training. It has also led to a wasteful use of financial aid so as to reduce {{the total number of}} needy minority students who can go to law school. The author suggests a massive cooperative effort <b>of</b> all <b>law</b> schools to pool resources to meet more effectively the need for more minority lawyers...|$|R

Since this period a lot of scientists and specialists of various branches have solved problems of the landscape character, the question of its terminology and evaluation. The master thesis is especially about the landscape character assessment (further only LCA). This question has been solved till today, also due to a new building law in the Czech Republic from 2006. The <b>admission</b> <b>of</b> this <b>law</b> means for the authorities of nature and landscape protection the statutory duty of including conditions of the protection of landscape character into the documents of territorial planning. A few methodologies of the LCA on the different area levels have been developed. The aim of the master thesis is a proposal of the methodology of the LCA and its application in the model area in the southwestern part of the Biele Karpaty Mountains (White Carphathians) in Western Slovakia. The model area is interesting because of an unique cultural landscape created by human activities and settlement during several centuries.
