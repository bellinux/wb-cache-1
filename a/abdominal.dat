5|$|<b>Abdominal</b> {{segments}} 3–6 and 10 each bear {{a pair of}} {{legs that}} are more fleshy. The thoracic legs are known as true legs and the <b>abdominal</b> legs are called prolegs. The true legs vary little in the Lepidoptera except for reduction in certain leaf-miners and elongation in the family Notodontidae. The prolegs contain {{a number of small}} hooks on the tip, which are known as crochets. The families of Lepidoptera differ in the number and positioning of their prolegs. Some larvae such as inchworms (Geometridae) and loopers (Plusiinae) have five pairs of prolegs or less, while others like Lycaenidae and slug caterpillars (Limacodidae) lack prolegs altogether. In some leaf-mining caterpillars there are crochets present on the <b>abdominal</b> wall which are reduced prolegs, while other leaf-mining species lack the crochets entirely. The <b>abdominal</b> spiracles are located {{on each side of the}} body on the first eight <b>abdominal</b> segments.|$|E
5|$|Ants are {{distinct}} in their morphology from other insects in having elbowed antennae, metapleural glands, {{and a strong}} constriction of their second <b>abdominal</b> segment into a node-like petiole. The head, mesosoma, and metasoma are the three distinct body segments. The petiole forms a narrow waist between their mesosoma (thorax plus the first <b>abdominal</b> segment, which is fused to it) and gaster (abdomen less the <b>abdominal</b> segments in the petiole). The petiole may be formed by one or two nodes (the second alone, or {{the second and third}} <b>abdominal</b> segments).|$|E
5|$|The {{nervous system}} in beetles {{contains}} all the types found in insects, varying between different species, from three thoracic and {{seven or eight}} <b>abdominal</b> ganglia which can be distinguished to that {{in which all the}} thoracic and <b>abdominal</b> ganglia are fused to form a composite structure.|$|E

50|$|Head lift - In a {{lying down}} position, knees bent at 90° angle, feet flat, slowly lift the head, chin toward your chest, (concentrate on {{isolation}} of the <b>abdominals</b> to prevent hip-flexors from being engaged), slowly contract <b>abdominals</b> toward floor, hold for two seconds, lower head to starting position for 2 seconds. Complete 10 repetitions.|$|R
5000|$|The plank {{strengthens}} the <b>abdominals,</b> back, and shoulders. Muscles {{involved in the}} front plank include: ...|$|R
5|$|Abdomen: The {{posterior}} <b>abdominal</b> segments are extensively modified for reproduction. Cerci are absent.|$|E
5|$|Appendicitis {{may present}} with vomiting, <b>abdominal</b> pain, {{and a small}} amount of {{diarrhea}} in up to 33% of cases. This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis. Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea. Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presents with <b>abdominal</b> pain, nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea. One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.|$|E
5|$|In March 2001, 82-year-old Watson {{underwent}} surgery for an <b>abdominal</b> aneurysm at Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle {{and died of}} complications from the surgery on May 11.|$|E
50|$|This {{challenging}} backbend {{has many}} benefits: it stimulates the internal organs, promotes balance, increases spinal flexibility, stretches <b>abdominals</b> {{and the front}} of the thighs.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes, weights are {{draped over}} or {{tied to the}} neck. As {{weighted}} vests often have weight placed here, they effectively have the same benefits. Advantages to neck weights and more upper-body-centric weighted vests is that they allow easier spinal flexion (contracting <b>abdominals</b> or stretching extensor spinae) and extension (contracting extensor spinae, stretching <b>abdominals).</b> This makes them prime for adding resistance to these movements, and takes out the requirement of using the arms to anchor weight to the upper body to add resistance.|$|R
50|$|Beach muscles {{refer to}} a group of muscles that lie {{on the front of the}} human body. These include the major muscles of the chest, shoulders, quadriceps, <b>abdominals</b> and biceps.|$|R
5|$|Other {{symptoms}} include: headache, {{nausea and}} vomiting, <b>abdominal</b> pain, muscle pain, or a scarlatiniform rash or palatal petechiae, {{the latter being}} an uncommon but highly specific finding.|$|E
5|$|Particular fats (chelev): {{particular}} {{parts of}} the <b>abdominal</b> fat of cattle, goats and sheep must be removed by a process called nikkur.|$|E
5|$|Analgesics may {{be needed}} for the <b>abdominal</b> and joint pains. It is {{uncertain}} as to whether HSP needs treatment beyond controlling the symptoms. Most patients do not receive therapy {{because of the high}} spontaneous recovery rate. Steroids are generally avoided. However, if they are given early in the disease episode, the duration of symptoms may be shortened, and <b>abdominal</b> pain can improve significantly. Moreover, the chance of severe kidney problems may be reduced. A systematic review of randomized clinical trials did not find any evidence that steroid treatment (prednisone) is effective at decreasing the likelihood of developing long-term kidney disease.|$|E
40|$|Background: Volleyball is a {{sportive}} modality {{that requires}} {{strength in the}} upper and lower extremities along with the trunk musculature. The improvement of muscular strength is very important along with agility and flexibility for a volleyball player. Aim of the study to find the effectiveness of resistance training on the strength of scapulo-humeral muscles and <b>abdominals</b> in male volley ball players. Objectives of this study is find out the effect of resistance training on the strength of the scapulo-humeral muscles by measuring peak torque by using an isokinetic dynamometer and to find out the effect of resistance training on strength of <b>abdominals</b> through 1 RM test. Methods: A group of 30 male volleyball players who have fulfilled the inclusion criteria were assigned into two groups control and experimental groups each consisting of 15 subjects. The subjects of the experimental group underwent resistance training under my supervision and the subjects of the control group done the same protocol unsupervised for 6 weeks. Results: There was significant improvement in the strength of scapula-humeral muscles and <b>abdominals</b> in the experimental group when compared to the control group when the pre and post intervention values were measured (p= 0. 05). Conclusion: Resistance training under supervision of the therapist resulted in significant improvement in strength of the scapulo-humeral muscles and <b>abdominals</b> in the male volleyball players...|$|R
50|$|Push-ups {{and their}} derivatives, pull-ups (or chin-ups) and dips, {{concentrate}} on a co-contraction of the triceps, biceps, deltoids, pectorals, lats, <b>abdominals</b> {{and lower back}} for stabilization in various ratios depending upon angle and leverage.|$|R
50|$|This pose {{has many}} benefits: it {{increases}} spinal flexibility, stimulates the internal organs, stretches the <b>abdominals,</b> {{the chest and}} {{the front of the}} shoulders. Practitioners discourage those knee or spinal injuries from performing the pose.|$|R
5|$|Gastroenteritis {{typically}} involves both {{diarrhea and}} vomiting, or less commonly, presents {{with only one}} or the other. <b>Abdominal</b> cramping may also be present. Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72hours after contracting the infectious agent. If due to a viral agent, the condition usually resolves within one week. Some viral causes may also be associated with fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain. If the stool is bloody, the cause {{is less likely to}} be viral and more likely to be bacterial. Some bacterial infections may be associated with severe <b>abdominal</b> pain and may persist for several weeks.|$|E
5|$|Gygax {{was married}} twice and had six children. In 2004, Gygax {{suffered}} two strokes, narrowly avoided a subsequent heart attack, was then diagnosed with an <b>abdominal</b> aortic aneurysm, {{and died in}} March 2008.|$|E
5|$|In June 2012, Bosh {{withdrew his}} name from {{consideration}} for the 2012 Olympics in London to recover from a lower <b>abdominal</b> strain that {{kept him out of}} some playoff games.|$|E
5000|$|Larvae are {{moderately}} stout, {{bright green}} with red dorsal spots, a red lateral blotch on the 1st—2nd <b>abdominals</b> and red marks on claspers; a rare variety is grey-brown. The pupae are red-brown with blackish wings.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the sit-up, in {{a proper}} crunch, the lower back stays on the floor. This is said by {{scientific}} literature to eliminate any involvement by the hip flexors, and make the crunch an effective isolation exercise for the <b>abdominals.</b>|$|R
5000|$|All front-facing muscles {{should be}} showcased since the {{contestant}} forces their hands {{together at the}} same time as contracting the pectorals, obliques, anterior deltoids, biceps, forearms and <b>abdominals.</b> The quadriceps and calves should also be flexed if at all possible.|$|R
5|$|Symptoms in PID {{range from}} none to severe. If there are symptoms, then fever, {{cervical}} motion tenderness, lower <b>abdominal</b> pain, new or different discharge, painful intercourse, uterine tenderness, adnexal tenderness, or irregular menstruation may be noted.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms may be {{different}} in adults and children; the main symptoms in adults are headache, <b>abdominal</b> pain, memory loss, kidney failure, male reproductive problems, and weakness, pain, or tingling in the extremities.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} {{variant of}} the vertebrate toxin found in the redback was cloned and sequenced in 2012, and {{was found to be}} a sequence of 1180 amino acids, with a strong similarity to the equivalent molecule across the Latrodectus mactans clade. The syndromes caused by bites from any spiders of the Latrodectus genus have similarities; there is some evidence there is a higher incidence of sweating, and local and radiating pain with the redback, while black widow envenomation results in more back and <b>abdominal</b> pain, and <b>abdominal</b> rigidity is a feature common with bites from the west coast button spider (Latrodectus indistinctus) of South Africa.|$|E
50|$|The Roman {{chair is}} a piece of {{exercise}} equipment. The equipment is mainly used for the lower back, but can also target the gluteal muscles, hamstring and <b>abdominals.</b> The definition of the equipment, and what 'Roman chair exercise' specifically means, is not clear.|$|R
50|$|In December 2011, Mitcham {{returned}} from an <b>abdominals</b> injury {{to win the}} Australian 10-metre platform with 480.05 points putting his Olympic dreams back on track. Not only did Mitcham achieve this accolade, he was also named Male Diver of the Year 2012.|$|R
5000|$|For White Sox players a new {{hydrotherapy}} {{room with}} three combinational hot-and-cold whirlpool tubs. An underwater treadmill, that can curb problems {{relating to the}} <b>abdominals,</b> back and knee, as well as strengthens the muscles and hip, is installed {{in one of the}} tubs.|$|R
25|$|The <b>abdominal</b> {{approach}} {{carries a}} small risk of impotence in males (e.g. 1-2% in <b>abdominal</b> rectopexy). <b>Abdominal</b> operations may be open or laparoscopic (keyhole surgery).|$|E
25|$|In children, <b>abdominal</b> {{radiography}} {{is indicated}} in the acute setting in suspected bowel obstruction, gastrointestinal perforation, foreign body in the alimentary tract, suspected <b>abdominal</b> mass and intussusception (latter {{as part of the}} differential diagnosis). Yet, CT scan is the best alternative for diagnosing intra-abdominal injury in children. For acute <b>abdominal</b> pain in adults, an <b>abdominal</b> x-ray has a low sensitivity and accuracy in general. Computed tomography provides an overall better surgical strategy planning, and possibly less unnecessary laparotomies. <b>Abdominal</b> x-ray is therefore not recommended for adults presenting in the emergency department with acute <b>abdominal</b> pain.|$|E
25|$|Among termite {{species in}} the Apicotermitinae that are soldierless or where {{soldiers}} are rare, mouth secretions are commonly replaced by <b>abdominal</b> dehiscence. These termites contract their <b>abdominal</b> muscles, resulting in the fracturing of the <b>abdominal</b> wall and the expulsion of gut contents. Because <b>abdominal</b> dehiscence is quite effective at killing ants, the noxious chemical substance released is likely contained within the termite itself.|$|E
50|$|The bicycle targets the rectus <b>abdominals</b> and the obliques. Also, the rectus <b>abdominals</b> can {{be worked}} out with the basic crunch, the {{vertical}} crunch, the reverse crunch, and the full vertical crunch, and when at a low enough body fat percentage (10-12% for males, 15-18% for females) the individual parts of the muscle become visible; many refer to this visible separation as a six pack. By exercising {{the internal and external}} obliques the stomach can be flattened while the waist line can be reduced. The long arm crunch, in which arms are straightened behind you, adds a longer level to the move and emphasizes {{the upper part of the}} abs. The plank exercise not only strengthens the abs but also the back and stabilizes the muscles.|$|R
50|$|The {{difficulty}} of the crunch can be increased by lying on a declined bench or holding a weight under the chin, on the chest or behind the head. Crunch exercises may be performed on exercise balls. Increasing the distance will also increase the load on the <b>abdominals</b> due to leverage.|$|R
50|$|Students {{typically}} learn ballet terminology and the pronunciation, meaning, {{and precise}} body form and movement {{associated with each}} term. Emphasis is placed on developing flexibility and strengthening the legs, feet, and body core (the center, or <b>abdominals)</b> as a strong core is essential for turns and many other ballet movements.|$|R
