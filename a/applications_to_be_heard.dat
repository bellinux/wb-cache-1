The applicant must serve its motion to intervene on the parties to the case and explain its reasons for intervening in the motion papers. In addition, U.S. federal law does not allow the procedure of intervention to violate the requirements of diversity jurisdiction. The court must have either diversity jurisdiction or federal question jurisdiction over the intervenor's claim. Supplemental jurisdiction is not permitted for intervention claims under (b) when the original claim's federal jurisdiction was based solely on diversity and exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the intervening claim would be inconsistent with the diversity requirements of [...] However, supplemental jurisdiction is permitted when the claims are so related that they form the same case or controversy.|$|R

50|$|The {{court hearing}} for the {{stopping-up}} order took place 4 June 2008 at Leicester Magistrates' Court. Representatives from the Ramblers Association, the Victorian Society, the Footpath Association, Leicester Civic Society and Leicestershire Industrial History Society were present. The Council {{applied for the}} order under Section 116 of the Highways Act 1980 to have 410 m of the bridge and viaduct closed, thereby avoiding the public enquiry {{that would have been}} necessary if Section 118 (also concerned with closure) had been used. The hearing was adjourned until 17 June when the <b>application</b> <b>was</b> due <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> by a district judge and a date set for a full hearing of the case. Following a three-day hearing, District Judge John Stobart granted the Council's application on 9 October 2008. Six local organisations and 6,000 petitioners had challenged the Council's decision. A local woman was subsequently arrested after staging a 12-hour occupation protest on the bridge.|$|R
50|$|The {{accession}} of {{new states}} to the European Convention on Human Rights following {{the fall of the}} Berlin Wall in 1989 led to a sharp increase in applications filed in the Court. The efficiency of the Court was threatened seriously by the large number of pending applications, which were accumulating and increasing steadily. In 1999 8,400 <b>applications</b> <b>were</b> allocated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard.</b> In 2003 27,200 cases were filed and the number of pending <b>applications</b> rose <b>to</b> approximately 65,000. In 2005, the Court opened 45,500 case files. In 2009 57,200 applications were allocated, with the number of pending <b>applications</b> rose <b>to</b> 119,300. At the time more than 90% of them <b>were</b> declared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> inadmissible, and the majority of cases decided, around 60% of the decisions by the Court, related <b>to</b> what <b>is</b> termed repetitive cases, where the Court has already delivered judgment finding a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights or where well established case law exists on a similar case. Protocol 11 <b>was</b> designed <b>to</b> deal with the backlog of pending cases by establishing the Court and its judges as a full-time institution, by simplifying the procedure and reducing the length of proceedings. However, as the workload of the Court continued to increase, the contracting states agreed that further reforms were necessary and in May 2004 the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers adopted Protocol 14 to the European Convention on Human Rights. Protocol 14 was drafted with the aim of reducing the workload of the Court and that of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, which supervises the execution of judgments, so that the Court could focus on cases that raise important human rights issues.|$|R
25|$|The right <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> refers <b>to</b> {{the right}} for a party's case <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> before a {{decision}} is made. Even if a statute does not state the requirement for a hearing, {{it does not necessarily}} mean that a hearing will never be required. However, this right is neither automatic nor absolute. For instance, in Yong Vui Kong, the Court of Appeal noted that at common law a convicted offender seeking mercy had no right <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> during the clemency process. In Singapore, this situation is reflected by the absence of any provision in Article 22P of the Constitution for an offender <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> during the clemency process.|$|R
