5|$|This bird is glossy {{black with}} a wide fork to the tail. Adults usually have a small white spot {{at the base of}} the gape. The iris is dark brown (not crimson as in the similar <b>ashy</b> <b>drongo).</b> The sexes cannot be told apart in the field. Juveniles are {{brownish}} and may have some white barring or speckling towards the belly and vent, and can be mistaken for the white-bellied drongo. First-year birds have white tips to the feathers of the belly, while second-years have these white-tipped feathers restricted to the vent.|$|E

50|$|The adult <b>ashy</b> <b>drongo</b> {{is mainly}} dark grey, and the tail {{is long and}} deeply forked, There {{are a number of}} {{subspecies}} varying {{in the shade of the}} grey plumage. Some subspecies have white markings on the head. Young birds are dull brownish grey.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ashy</b> <b>drongo</b> has short {{legs and}} sits very upright while perched prominently, often {{high on a}} tree. It is insectivorous and forages by making aerial sallies but {{sometimes}} gleans from tree trunks. They are found singly, in pairs or small groups. During migration they fly in small flocks.|$|E
50|$|The {{host species}} include Lanius cristatus in the Amur region, black drongo and Pica cyanea in China. In India, {{they have been}} found to be fed by black drongos and <b>ashy</b> <b>drongo.</b> Other hosts that have been {{recorded}} include black-headed oriole, streaked spiderhunter, Eurylaimus ochromalus and Dicrurus paradiseus.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ashy</b> <b>drongo</b> (Dicrurus leucophaeus) is {{a species}} of bird in the drongo family Dicruridae. It is found widely {{distributed}} across South and Southeast Asia with several populations that vary {{in the shade of}} grey, migration patterns and in the size or presence of a white patch around the eye.|$|E
50|$|Among the birds, the <b>ashy</b> <b>drongo,</b> scarlet minivet, grey-headed canary-flycatcher, white-crowned forktail, brown fish owl, crested serpent eagle, shikra, velvet-fronted nuthatch, blue-throated barbet, {{coppersmith}} barbet, blue-winged leafbird, brown-cheeked fulvetta and red junglefowl deserve mention. The Khun Tan mountains also act as {{a natural}} barrier for species west and east of the range, such as the pied bushchat.|$|E

50|$|The <b>ashy</b> <b>drongo</b> breeds in {{the hills}} of {{tropical}} southern Asia from eastern Afghanistan east to southern China and Indonesia. Many populations {{in the northern part of}} its range are migratory. Charles Vaurie described subspecies beavani (after Robert Cecil Beavan) as the population that breeds along the Himalayas that wintered in peninsular India. However, later workers include this as part of longicaudatus which also has a population that breeds in central India. In winter, the species is particularly fond of hill forests. E. C. Stuart Baker described stevensi which Vaurie considered as being either beavani or hopwoodi of the eastern Himalayas. To the east of the range of hopwoodi is mouhouti of Thailand and Myanmar. To the north of this range are leucogenis and salangensis (both migratory mainly to areas further south but also known from Nagaland) while bondi is found to the south. Along the southeast Asian island chain, there are number of insular populations including periophthalmus, batakensis, phaedrus, siberu and nigrescens. The nominate form is said to be found on Simalur, Java, Bali, Lombok, Palawan, and Balabac Islands.|$|E
5000|$|In hawking behavior, a bird {{will watch}} for prey from a {{suitable}} perch. When it spies potential prey, the bird will fly swiftly from its perch {{to catch the}} insect in its bill, {{then return to the}} perch or sometimes to a different perch. This maneuver is also called a [...] "sally". Prey that is very small relative to the bird, such as gnats, may be consumed immediately while in flight, but larger prey, such as bees or moths, are usually brought back to a perch before being eaten. Sometimes the prey will attempt to escape and this can result in a fluttering pursuit before returning to the perch. Depending on the species of bird, there are observable variations on this behavior. Some species, such as the olive-sided flycatcher of North America and the <b>ashy</b> <b>drongo</b> of the Indian Subcontinent, tend to choose an exposed perch, such as a dead tree branch overlooking a clearing, whereas others, such as the North American Acadian flycatcher and the Asian small niltava perch within the cover of foliage deep in a forest or woodland habitat.|$|E
50|$|Literature on {{historical}} records of birdlife {{of the region}} is very scanty. Forsyth's (1889) casual remarks indicated that several species like black-headed yellow bulbul (Pycnonotus melanicterus), painted spurfowl (Galloperdix lunulata), lesser adjutant (Leptoptilos javanicus), and Indian golden-backed three-toed woodpecker (Dinopium javanense) which are now found only in small restricted areas were apparently quite common and widespread around late 19th century. The recent rediscovery of the forest spotted owlet (Heteroglaux blewitti), endemic to Central Indian Highlands after about 114 years (Rasmussen 1998), underscores the significance of more avifaunal studies in the region for conservation planning. The forests of central India are {{also one of the}} few known refuges for several globally threatened and restricted-range species like Malabar pied hornbill (Anthracoceros coronatus), spotted grey creeper (Salpornis spilonotus), white-bellied minivet (Pericrocotus erythropygius), Asian brown flycatcher (Muscicapa dauurica) and green munia (Amandava formosa) (Ali & Ripley, 1983). A recent survey on breeding birds of Central Indian Highlands by Wildlife Institute of India (Jayapal et al., 2005) has added several new breeding records and range-extensions like crested goshawk (Accipiter trivirgatus), Oriental scops owl (Otus sunia), spot-bellied eagle owl (Bubo nipalensis), drongo-cuckoo (Surniculus lugubris), <b>ashy</b> <b>drongo</b> (Dicrurus leucophaeus), and striated grassbird (Megalurus palustris).|$|E
40|$|Surveys {{were carried}} out at 10 sites in the buffer and core zones of Sariska Tiger Reserve during 2007 - 2011. MacKinnon species listing method was used to compile a {{checklist}} of birds. A total of 224 bird species was recorded including 36 new records. <b>Ashy</b> <b>Drongo</b> Dicrurus leucophaeus, Marshall Iora Aegithina nigrolutea, Eurasian Eagle Owl Bubo bubo, Brown-headed Barbet Megalaima zeylanica, Indian Nightjar Caprimulgus asiaticus, Long-legged Buzzard Buteo rufinus, Northern Goshawk Accipiter gentilis, Red-necked Falcon Falco chicquera, Pheasant-tailed Jacana Hydrophasianus chirurgus, Red-whiskered Bulbul Pycnonotus jocosus, White-capped Water Redstart Chaimarrornis leucocephalus were some new records. Some important observations are given in detail...|$|E
40|$|I {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that mobbing chiefly functions as a nest defence mechanism by studying the mobbing behaviour of two species of drongo (black drongo Dicrurus macrocercus and <b>ashy</b> <b>drongo</b> D. leucophaeus) towards two species of raptor in rain forest of western Java, Indonesia. It was predicted that firstly mobbing would occur more frequent and more intense during the drongoÂ¿s breeding season and secondly {{that it would be}} more frequent and more intense towards the nest and egg predating black eagle Ictinaetus malayensis compared to the relatively harmless Javan hawk-eagle Spizaetus bartelsi. I found a seasonal difference in mobbing frequency and intensity in the predicted direction for the Javan hawk-eagle but not for the black eagle. Black eagles were not more frequently or more intensely mobbed than Javan hawk-eagles. In the tropics, mobbing to repel a predator may be adaptive at both seasons due to the year round residency of drongos. Furthermore, if black eagles use the frequency or intensity of mobbing as a clue to locate nests, a lack of seasonal difference in mobbing behaviour by drongos may be an evolutionary favourable strategy...|$|E
