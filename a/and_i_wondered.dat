5|$|One day I chanced {{to see a}} {{performance}} of the Bunraku puppet theater and was very surprised by it. It was in the tone quality, the timbre, of the futazao shamisen, the wide-necked shamisen used in Bunraku, that I first recognized the splendor of traditional Japanese music. I was very moved by it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> why my attention had never been captured before by this Japanese music.|$|E
25|$|Lienhard’s {{keen sense}} of {{observation}} {{was not limited to}} outward features, but involved his heart and mind as well. Although he respected the indigenous people from the start as the natives of the land, his early comments are not free from the typical ethnocentric views of the whites. Gradually his perspective changed, especially during his stay at Mimal on the Yuba River, where he lived for six months in isolation from white settlers and in close contact with the indigenous peoples of the surrounding villages. Some gathered regularly at his house, observed his activities with interest, traded, or occasionally helped with garden work. They taught him to become a first-rate archer, now and then took him along to their families, and nursed him back to health when he fell ill. Thus Lienhard began to observe their daily life and marveled at their skill in basketry, hunting and fishing. He often joined them in those pursuits and describes their methods of procuring and preparing food. His observations led him to understand that these people had organized their style of life in creative symbiosis with their surroundings, that their customs, though different, were ingenious, and that assessing them from a culturally biased vantage point did not do them justice. His growing understanding was extraordinary and increasingly run counter to the then dominant views. One night in the winter of 1848–49, he overheard his young Indian herdsmen talking of the times before the whites had invaded their valleys and of the ever worsening conditions. “The subdued talk of the Indians caused me to ponder,” he wrote. “In my thoughts I tried to put myself in the position of the Indians; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> whether I would acquiesce if I were driven out of my and my ancestors’ homeland as had been the fate of the poor Indians. I confess that I was overwhelmed by strong feelings of revenge, always coming to the conclusion that I would take revenge on the shameless, greedy invaders in every possible way.” He knew from first-hand experience, however, that cooperation, escape, or resistance could all mean death for indigenous people.|$|E
500|$|Judith Kirkwood of Orange Coast Magazine {{has stated}} that [...] "The Beverly Hills Hotel is such an icon that my friend, Gretchen, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> {{if it was a}} mirage when the taxi pulled up in the porte cochere and {{deposited}} us on a red carpet, but realized that it was [...] "more like a peachy pink dream dusted with gold— and green and white striped accents".|$|E
6000|$|... "Bein’ {{all alone}} here," [...] said Uncle Barber, [...] "I think a lot. I sit an’ think until I get an idea. It comes quite sudden like, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>I</b> {{never thought of}} it before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You, Cap'n Kittridge! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> you {{can talk}} so," [...] said his wife. [...] "It's an awful responsibility, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> you don't think whether or no you're fit for it." ...|$|R
60|$|I incline to fatalistic submission. I suppose I had {{no power}} to leave him behind.... <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder.</b> The old Utopists never had to {{encumber}} themselves {{with this sort of}} man.|$|R
500|$|Wirkola said, [...] "I have {{a strong}} memory from my {{childhood}} of just how dark and gruesome their tale was <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> {{what would have happened}} to the two of them when they grew up? They had this dark past and this intense hatred of witches. So as I thought about it, it made sense to me that of course they would be fated to become great witch hunters. We wanted it to feel like this could be happening 300 years ago but at the same time, there is a modern spin on all the action, characters and weaponry. It was a fun way to make a classical world feel fresh." [...] Wirkola said that he originally came with that idea in 2007 while studying film and television at Bond University in Australia, when he wanted to make it as just a short film, and that the film school director Simon Hunter advised him: [...] "Tom, don't ever speak of the idea again until you are in front of a Hollywood producer and I guarantee you will sell it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{vision of}} Mary was {{described}} as being beautiful, standing a few feet above the ground. She wore a white cloak, hanging in full folds and fastened at the neck. The crown appeared of a golden brightness, of a deeper hue, than the striking whiteness of the robe she wore; the upper parts of the crown {{appeared to be a}} series of sparkles, or glittering crosses. She {{was described as}} [...] "deep in prayer", with her eyes raised to heaven, her hands raised to the shoulders or a little higher, the palms inclined slightly to the shoulders. Bridget Trench [...] "went in immediately to kiss, as I thought, the feet of the Blessed Virgin; but I felt nothing in the embrace but the wall, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> why I could not feel with my hands the figures which I had so plainly and so distinctly seen".|$|E
60|$|So she said, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered,</b> feeling trammelled and hurt. It did {{not make}} me free.|$|E
6000|$|... "Beautiful?" [...] cried Miss Desmond. [...] "It was my grandmother's name; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> they didn't call {{me for my}} great-grandmother, Daphne, and be {{done with}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{a curious}} thing, dad, that the Frenchman should be coming {{backwards}} and forwards here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> that the revenue people don't inquire into it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Put {{it under}} the pump, lad. I will pump on it," [...] the coachman said. [...] "He's a bad-tempered brute, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> the squire keeps it." ...|$|R
60|$|Pistol shots cracked behind me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> how Michelot was faring, but {{dared not}} pause to look.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> {{to myself}} to whom on earth they could ever mean {{against her will}} to marry her.|$|E
60|$|The Colonel {{stared into}} vacancy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> whether anyone {{could be quite}} so {{innocent}} of guile as he looked.|$|E
60|$|This is my seventieth birthday, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> if you {{all rise}} {{to the size of}} that proposition, realizing all the {{significance}} of that phrase, seventieth birthday.|$|R
6000|$|<b>And,</b> [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> if <b>I</b> am aphoristic <b>and</b> subtle? <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> if {{when she}} gets the rice-powder off, Claire isn't a lot more like Milt than she thought?" ...|$|R
30|$|I feel out {{of place}} because I think some of [the other majors] know more than <b>I</b> do <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> how because we have taken the same classes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know {{anything}} about any snowballs," [...] said Codfish. [...] "I noticed the floor was all wet <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> what it meant." ...|$|E
6000|$|She creaked, [...] "O Mrs. Kennicott, I'm {{in such a}} fix. I'm {{supposed}} to lead the discussion, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> would you come and help?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} him, his proud, eagle face, and his tall, sinewy figure, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> {{whether in the}} whole land there was a finer, handsomer man.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "it wouldn't do to put {{anything}} that wasn't pretty on a neck like that, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> {{if you would}} let me fix it." ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{they went}} along he said, [...] "Let {{us have a}} look at these bushes, Bertie. The soil is very thin about here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> that the trees grew." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder,</b> {{though perhaps}} {{he could not}} have told, what Aunt Anne would have done if Uncle Clarence had not been so forbearing before he went to China. CLARE FRITH.|$|R
6000|$|... "I had no {{idea you}} were down here!" [...] I exclaimed; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> whether she didn't know me at all or knew me only by my voice.|$|E
60|$|In my mind--and modestly--I {{asked for}} particulars, but Satan paid no {{attention}} to my thought. Next, my mind wandered to the astrologer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> where he might be.|$|E
60|$|Her {{face was}} black with shadow, {{but in her}} voice I caught a hint of tears, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> whether they were shed on my behalf or on her own.|$|E
6000|$|So I {{wait for}} another morn [...] And another night [...] In this soul-sick blight; [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> much [...] As I sit, why such A woman as I was born! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] {{said the}} boy. [...] "I {{wonder if the}} master of the Damoiseaux is as strict as that lady said, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> when <b>I</b> shall see Uncle Eustace again." ...|$|R
6000|$|When blest {{with the}} smiles of my fair, [...] I know not how much I adore: [...] Those smiles let another but share, [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>I</b> prized them no more! [...] Then whence can I hope a relief from my woe, [...] When the falser she seems, still the fonder I grow? [Exit.] ...|$|R
60|$|I did {{not doubt}} it, yet I dared not make so bold as to confess it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> {{why they should}} laugh to hear her earnest censure of them.|$|E
60|$|Steele's {{face was}} bloodless now, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> {{if it had}} to do with her scathing scorn or {{something}} that he hid with his hand closing his coat that way.|$|E
60|$|So {{indeed it}} proved, for the mage began rapidly to divest himself of his mysterious swathings. Wrapper by wrapper he undid, cerement on cerement, till both Leonora <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> {{when he would}} stop.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, say, girl, Mrs. Appleby <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are {{thinking}} of renting one of these here bungalonies, like the fellow says, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> if we could {{take a look at}} this house, to see how it looks furnished?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder Miggs {{was able}} to send a report at all, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> still more that you should put any faith in it," [...] his son said impatiently. [...] "The fellow is never sober." ...|$|R
6000|$|In my neighbor's windows the gas-lights flare, [...] As {{the dancers}} swing in a waltz of Strauss; [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> now could <b>I</b> fit that air [...] To {{the song of}} this sad old house.|$|R
