With a keyboard and mouse, the player sets routes and operates level crossings as necessary as well as simulations/timetable specific tasks such as operating ground frames.

The simulations may be played in real time or sped up. The aim of play is to achieve a good score by overcoming problems and ensuring on-time train running.

40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} the {{benefits}} of processor-cache affinity scheduling of parallel network protocol processing, in a setting in which protocol processing executes on the multiprocessor host concurrently with a general workload of non-protocol activity. We implement two parallelization <b>approaches,</b> <b>Locking</b> and Independent Protocol Stacks (IPS), in the UDP/IP/FDDI protocol stack in the x-kernel on an SGI Challenge XL multiprocessor. We then conduct a set of multiprocessor experiments designed to measure packet processing times under specific conditions of cache state. These measurements are then used to parameterize the analytic component of a simulation model of multiprocessor protocol processing, designed to reflect the impact on protocol execution time of the non-protocol workload. In this manner, {{we are able to}} explore {{the benefits of}} affinity scheduling of parallel network processing (while accounting for the impact of general non-protocol activity) in a carefully-controlled e [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{performance}} advantages can {{be realized}} by implementing a database system on a cache-coherent shared memory multiprocessor. An efficient implementation of a lock manager {{is a prerequisite for}} efficient transaction processing in multiprocessor database systems. To this end, we examine two approaches to the implementation of locking in a cache-coherent shared memory multiprocessor database system. The first <b>approach,</b> shared-memory <b>locking</b> (SML), allows each node (processor) of the multiprocessor to acquire and release locks directly via the use of cache-coherent shared memory. The second <b>approach,</b> message-passing <b>locking</b> (MPL), typically requires messages to be sent to a lock manager, located on a remote node. Our empirical evaluation of these approaches on the KSR- 1 multiprocessor indicates that for most database locking traffic patterns, the performance of SML is substantially superior to that of MPL. For instance, when contention is high, the performance of SML is nearly an [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Modal {{real-time}} {{stream processing}} applications often contain cyclic dependencies and are typically executed on multiprocessor systems with processor sharing. Most real-time operating system kernels for these systems support Static Priority Pre-emptive (SPP) scheduling, however {{there is currently}} no suitable temporal analysis technique available {{for this type of}} systems. In this paper, we present a compositional temporal analysis approach for modal and cyclic stream processing applications executed on SPP scheduled multiprocessor systems. In this <b>approach,</b> <b>locks</b> and barriers are added such that the temporal behavior of modes can be characterized independently. As a result, the composition of modes does not change their characterization. This enables the use of an existing Structured Variable-Rate Phased Dataflow (SVPDF) model based dataflow analysis technique to determine the worst-case temporal behavior. The SVPDF model and the parallel implementation including locks and barriers are generated by a multiprocessor compiler. The applicability of the analysis approach is demonstrated using a WLAN 802. 11 p application. Conditions under which pipelined execution can be achieved are identified. The analysis results are verified with a dataflow simulator that supports sharing of resources...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown {{the superiority of the}} optimistic {{protocols}} over the lock-based protocols for scheduling soft or firm real-time transactions. However, optimistic protocols cannot provide schedulability analysis for hard real-time transactions because of uncertain transaction restarts. In this paper, we develop new combined <b>locking</b> <b>approach</b> for using optimistic concurrency control to schedule hard real-time transactions. This approach can resolve serious conflicts, which cannot be resolved via dynamic adjustment of serialization order using timestamp intervals, and thus avoid transaction restarts. Furthermore, the combined <b>locking</b> <b>approach</b> can be integrated with the priority ceiling mechanism to achieve single-blocking and deadlock-free properties, and perform schedulability analysis for hard real-time transactions...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Understanding {{the nature of}} {{technological}} practice {{is one of the}} eight achievement objectives specified in the New Zealand technology curriculum (Ministry of Education, 1995). Despite only a small place within the curriculum document, technological practice has become a key concept used in the professional development of teachers and the assessment of technology. This paper describes some of the different points of view about the meaning of technological practice. It also summarises some initial results from a survey canvassing views on technological practice held by those involved in leadership positions in technology education in New Zealand. Experiences of technological practice seem to be genuinely helpful in building teachers’ understanding of technology. However, how these translate into what teachers and children do in classrooms is less clear. Though this research suggests that most leaders in technology education agree that children meet the curriculum aims through technological practice I ask whether this <b>approach</b> <b>locks</b> us into always valuing technology and constrains the possibilities of being critical. Finally, an alternative to the definition of technological practice listed on the New Zealand Ministry of Education website is suggested...|$|R

40|$|Many {{high energy}} physics and nuclear science {{applications}} require sub-nanosecond time resolution measurements over {{many thousands of}} detector channels. Phase-locked loops have been employed {{in the past to}} obtain accurate time references for these measurements. An alternative solution, based on a delay-locked loop (DLL) is described. This solution allows for a very high level of integration yet still offers resolution in the sub-nanosecond regime. Two variations on this solution are outlined. A novel phase detector, based on the Muller C element, is used to implement a charge pump where the injected charge approaches zero as the loop <b>approaches</b> <b>lock</b> on the leading edge of an input clock reference. This greatly reduces timing jitter. In the second variation the loop locks to both the leading and trailing clock edges. In this second implementation, software coded layout generators are used to automatically layout a highly integrated, multi-channel, time to digital converter (TDC). Complex clock generation can be, achieved by taking symmetric taps off the delay elements. The two circuits, DLL and TDC, were implemented in a CMOS 1. 2 {mu}m and 0. 8 {mu}m technology, respectively. Test results show a timing jitter of less than 35 ps for the DLL circuit and better solution for the TDC circuit...|$|R

50|$|To date {{there have}} been 4 {{randomized}} controlled trials of Maudsley Family Therapy. The first (Russell et al., 1987) compared the Maudsley Model to individual therapy and found that family-based treatment was more effective for patients under 19 years of age with {{less than three years}} duration of illness. Ninety percent of these patients achieved a normal weight or the return of menses at the end of treatment including at 5 year follow-up (Eisler, et al., 1997).Two further randomised trials compared standard Maudsley treatment with a modified version where the patients and parents were seen separately (Le Grange et al. 1992, Eisler et al., 2000). In these trials approximately 70% of patients returned to a normal body weight (>90% IBW) or experienced the return of menses at the end of treatment, regardless of which version of the model was employed. Results from a more recent randomised controlled trial suggest that results are maintained with the manualisation of the Maudsley <b>approach</b> (<b>Lock</b> & Le Grange, 2001). There is also evidence that a short (6 months) and a long course (1 year) of treatment results in a similar positive outcome (Lock et al., 2005). Finally, the outcome using family-based treatment appears just as positive for children (9-12 years old) as it does for adolescents (Lock et al., 2006).|$|R
