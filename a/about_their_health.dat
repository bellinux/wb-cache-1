5|$|The Sanny and Jerry Ryan Center for Prevention and Genetics, {{housed in}} Choice Health & Fitness, {{encourages}} individuals to think <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>health</b> through preventive measures {{before it becomes}} medically necessary to seek care. The {{first of its kind}} in the region, the Center provides a unique opportunity for individuals to take an active approach to a healthier life. Truyu Aesthetic Center, with locations in Grand Forks, East Grand Forks and across the region, offers surgical and non-surgical procedures, services and products under the support of Altru. Altru Health System is the result of a 1997 merger of United Hospital (formerly Deaconess and St. Michael's Hospitals) and the Grand Forks Clinic.|$|E
5|$|In October 2000, Dr John Ryan, an Accident & Emergency {{consultant}} at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton criticised {{the number of}} patients visiting the department for minor ailments without first contacting their GP. Ryan attributed this phenomenon to patients viewing Holby City and American medical drama ER, and falsely perceiving hospitals as glamorous. A three-year Belgian research project, presented at a British Psychological Society meeting in September 2008, claimed that watching Holby City and similar medical dramas such as Casualty and ER had a subliminal influence on fear of illness. 1,300 teenagers were questioned on their viewing habits, and those who watched more medical dramas were found to be up to 10% more fearful <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>health,</b> with females more affected than males. Dr Jan Van Mierlo of Hasselt University stated that further research was needed into the long-term impact of television.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} whether parental worry <b>about</b> <b>their</b> children's <b>health</b> predicts usage of a pediatric Internet intervention for encopresis. Methods Thirty-nine families {{with a child}} diagnosed with encopresis completed a national clinical trial of an Internet-based intervention for encopresis (www. ucanpooptoo. com). Parents rated worry <b>about</b> <b>their</b> children's <b>health,</b> encopresis severity, current parent treatment for depression, and parent comfort with the Internet. Usage indicators were collected while participants utilized the intervention. Results Regression analyses showed that parents who reported higher baseline levels of worry <b>about</b> <b>their</b> children's <b>health</b> showed greater subsequent intervention use (β =. 52, p =. 002), even after accounting for other plausible predictors. Exploratory analyses indicated that this effect may be stronger for families with younger children. Conclusions Characteristics of individuals using Internet-based treatment programs, such as parental worry <b>about</b> <b>their</b> children's <b>health,</b> can influence intervention usage, and should be considered by developers of Internet interventions...|$|R

25|$|Age. Age {{can also}} be a factor in health disparities for a number of reasons. As many older Americans exist on fixed incomes which may make paying for health care {{expenses}} difficult. Additionally, they may face other barriers such as impaired mobility or lack of transportation which make accessing health care services challenging for them physically. Also, they may not have the opportunity to access health information via the internet as less than 15% of Americans over the age of 65 have access to the internet. This could put older individuals at a disadvantage in terms of accessing valuable information <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>health</b> and how to protect it. On the other hand, older individuals in the US (65 or above) are provided with medical care via Medicare.|$|E

25|$|A {{positive}} correlation between minorities and a socio economic status of being low income in industrialized and rural regions of the U.S. depict how low income communities tend to include more individuals that have a lower educational background, most importantly in health. Income status, diet, and education all construct a higher burden for low income minorities, to be conscious <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>health.</b> Research conducted by medical departments at universities in San diego, Miami, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina suggested that minorities in regions where lower socioeconomic status is common, there was a direct relationship with unhealthy diets and greater distance of supermarkets. Therefore, in areas where supermarkets are less accessible (food deserts) to impoverished areas, the more likely these groups are to purchase inexpensive fast food or just follow an unhealthy diet. As a result, because food deserts are more prevalent in low income communities, minorities that reside in these areas are more prone obesity, {{which can lead to}} diseases such as chronic kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes.|$|E
25|$|Quinn et al. (1998) find {{significant}} correlation between health status and retirement status. They transform answers for question about health status from five levels (“excellent”, “very good”, “good”, “fair” and “poor”) into three levels and report results for three groups of people. 85% of respondents who answered “excellent” or “very good” to the question <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>health</b> in 1992 were still working two years after this interview, compared to 82% of those who answered “good”, and 70% of those answered “fair” or “poor”. This fact is also true for year 1996: 73% {{of people from the}} first group were still on the job market, while this is 66% and 55% for other groups of people. However, Dhaval, Rashad and Spasojevic (2006) using data from six waves of Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) show that relationship between retirement and health status can imply the opposite effect in reality: physical and mental health decline after retirement.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} way for Anglo-Saxon {{communities}} {{to deal with}} their dead was through inhumation, the burial of the corpse straight into the ground. This form of corpse disposal would have taken less [...] "time and equipment" [...] than cremation.

In many cases, alkaline soils have led to the good preservation of the skeletal remains, enabling archaeologists to excavate inhumed corpses and gain [...] "a great deal of information" [...] from them. Data that can be gathered or inferred from Anglo-Saxon inhumations includes the biological sex or age of the individual, as well as information <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>health</b> or lifestyle. Isotopic analysis of the skeletons can be used to detect which region the individual grew up in.|$|E

2500|$|When adopted {{children}} grow into young adults, many worry <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>health.</b> For many {{adopted children}}, their adoptive families are given little to {{none of their}} medical history, especially if the adoption was international. This can be {{due to lack of}} information {{on the part of the}} biological family, type of adoption or circumstance in which the adoptee was found (for example being left at an orphanage in a foreign country). Simple trips to the doctor or dentist, for something as small as a check up, can bring about great worry because there is so many unknowns to ones health when the person is adopted. Anxiety over lack of medical history may become worse for those who are seeking to get married and start a family. If one of the parents is unaware of medical history, having a child becomes much more difficult. The risks of being unable to conceive, or the child being born with certain health issues are higher because parental medical history is unknown.|$|E
2500|$|While {{many aspects}} of LGBT health disparities are {{heretofore}} uninvestigated, at this stage, {{it is known that}} one of the main forms of healthcare discrimination nbsp&LGBT individuals face is discrimination from healthcare workers or institutions themselves. A systematic literature review of publications in English and Portuguese from 2004–2014 demonstrate significant difficulties in accessing care secondary to discrimination and homophobia from healthcare professionals. This discrimination can take the form of verbal abuse, disrespectful conduct, refusal of care, the withholding of health information, nbsp&inadequate treatment, and outright violence. In a study analyzing the quality of healthcare for South African {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM), researchers interviewed a cohort of individuals <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>health</b> experiences, finding that MSM who identified as homosexual felt their access to healthcare was limited due to an inability to find clinics employing healthcare workers who did not discriminate against their sexuality. They also reportedly faced [...] "homophobic verbal harassment from healthcare workers when presenting for STI treatment". Further, MSM who did not feel comfortable disclosing their sexual activity to healthcare workers failed to identify as homosexuals, which limited the quality of the treatment they received.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to explore parents' views and {{agreement}} of their child's current and future health, as well as the family's functioning in daily life with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Methods: In this study, 119 parents (65 mothers and 54 fathers) of 66 adolescents (11 - 16 years) with IBD completed a questionnaire regarding their views of their child's IBD and health-related behaviour. Results: The majority of the parents held a positive view of <b>their</b> child's current <b>health</b> status. However, the parents voiced a range of worries <b>about</b> <b>their</b> children's future <b>health</b> and life situation such as fear about the side effects of medication, concerns for future schooling, social life and employment options. Within the families, the parental pairs had more similar views <b>about</b> <b>their</b> child's current <b>health</b> status than <b>about</b> <b>their</b> future <b>health.</b> Factors that affected the parents' views consisted of cohabitation status, i. e. parents not living together, and severe disease course, both correlated with a more negative view of the child's current health and family functioning. Conclusion: The majority of the parents in this study had a largely positive view of <b>their</b> child's current <b>health</b> status, but they expressed concerns <b>about</b> <b>their</b> child's future <b>health.</b> Knowledge about parents' thoughts may be of importance for healthcare teams supporting families with IBD...|$|R
40|$|Background Pregnancy and the {{postnatal}} {{period is}} a period of potential vulnerability for women and families. It is UK policy that all women are asked <b>about</b> <b>their</b> mental <b>health</b> and wellbeing early in pregnancy and following the birth to help detect potential problems and prevent serious adverse outcome. However, identification of mental health problems in pregnancy may be less than 50 % Aims To find out which women are asked <b>about</b> <b>their</b> mood and mental health during pregnancy and postnatally, and about offer and uptake of treatment. Methods Secondary analysis of a national maternity survey carried out in 2014 which asked about sociodemographic factors, care in pregnancy, childbirth, and the postnatal period with specific questions on emotional and mental health. Results The usable response rate to the survey was 47 % (4571 women). Most women recalled being asked <b>about</b> <b>their</b> mental <b>health</b> in pregnancy (82 %) and in the postnatal period (90 %). However, antenatally, Asian and older women {{were less likely to be}} asked and to be offered treatment. In the postnatal period, differences were more marked. Non-white women, those living in more deprived areas, and those who had received less education were less likely to be asked <b>about</b> <b>their</b> mental <b>health,</b> to be offered treatment, and to receive support. Women with a trusting relationship with their midwife were more likely to be asked <b>about</b> <b>their</b> mental <b>health.</b> Conclusion The inequities described in this study suggest that the inverse care law is operating in relation to this aspect of maternity care. Those women most likely to be in need of support and treatment are least likely to be offered it and may be at risk of serious adverse outcomes. </p...|$|R
