5|$|The {{build up}} to Euro 1988 in West Germany was far from ideal, as key player Mark Lawrenson was forced to retire after {{injuring}} his Achilles tendon, Liam Brady picked up a serious knee injury and Mark Kelly was also injured. The first match of the tournament was against England at the Neckarstadion, and Charlton reasoned that {{the threat posed by}} English wingers Chris Waddle and John Barnes could be nullified by allowing the English defence to feel comfortable on the ball without allowing them a pass; this made the build-up play slow and containable. His game-plan worked and Ireland claimed a 1–0 win after Ray Houghton secured an early lead. He then compensated for a series of injuries by playing Ronnie Whelan and Kevin Sheedy in central midfield, and was rewarded with a great performance and <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>point</b> in a 1–1 draw with the Soviet Union at the Niedersachsenstadion, Whelan scoring the goal. To qualify they only needed a point against the Netherlands at the Parkstadion, and Charlton devised a time-wasting plan with goalkeeper Packie Bonner that he was forced to abandon after referee Horst Brummeier was less than impressed. Ireland lost the game 1–0 after Wim Kieft scored an 82nd-minute goal. England and Ireland were eliminated whilst Netherlands and the Soviet Union qualified – both teams would go on to contest the final.|$|E
500|$|While {{on his own}} Lock Up the Wolves US tour in August 1990, former Black Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio {{was joined}} on stage at the Roy Wilkins Auditorium by former Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler to perform [...] "Neon Knights". Following the show, the two {{expressed}} interest in rejoining Black Sabbath. Butler convinced Iommi, who in turn broke up the current line-up, dismissing vocalist Tony Martin and bassist Neil Murray. [...] "I do regret that {{in a lot of}} ways", Iommi said. [...] "We were at <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>point</b> then. We decided to [...] and I don't even know why, really. There's the financial aspect, but that wasn't it. I seemed to think maybe we could recapture something we had".|$|E
500|$|MSNBC's Patrick Enwright {{listed the}} episode as his ninth {{favorite}} in the show in 2007, saying it [...] "brilliantly skewers new-agey self-help gurus" [...] and adding that [...] "it's also noteworthy for clever pop-cultural references." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, described it as [...] "A very bizarre episode in which everyone just has a good time." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: [...] "A certified classic, 'Child' mocks the self-help field and makes <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>point</b> along the way. Of course, it does all this with scads of clever moments and becomes a great show. As one who works in psychology, it's hard to resist this program's spoofery." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of B+ and described Homer's escapades with the trampoline as [...] "the episode's brightest spot." [...] Turner described the Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner homage as [...] "one of the show's most overt and inspired tributes to the Warner cartoons." [...] Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 4.5 out of 5.|$|E

[...] It’s <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>point.</b> Although portions of Berryman’s late work are sloppy and erratic, these poems help clarify the spiritual struggle that motivates and sustains his best writing.|$|E
2500|$|The 2002 {{off-season}} brought changes, as Miles {{was traded}} to the Cavaliers for [...] Andre Miller, who led the NBA in assists in 2001–02 with 11 per game. With <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>point</b> guard in Miller, Lamar Odom at small forward, one of the league's best power forwards, Brand, the center Olowokandi, and a good supporting cast off the bench, the Clippers could actually make a run for the playoffs. However, with poor team chemistry and injuries (the Clippers lost 293 man-games to injury), they finished with a disappointing 27–55 record. Head coach Alvin Gentry was replaced by Dennis Johnson midway through the 2002–03 season.|$|E
