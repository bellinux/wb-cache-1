5|$|After the Muslim {{conquest of}} Persia, Zoroastrians were given dhimmi status and {{subjected}} to persecutions; discrimination and harassment began {{in the form of}} sparse violence. Those paying Jizya were subjected to insults <b>and</b> <b>humiliation</b> by the tax collectors. Zoroastrians who were captured as slaves in wars were given their freedom if they converted to Islam.|$|E
5|$|During the game's loading points, Isaac {{is shown}} {{curled up in}} a ball, crying. His {{thoughts}} are visible, ranging among rejection from his mother <b>and</b> <b>humiliation</b> from his peers to a scenario involving his own death. The game features 13 possible endings, one after each major boss fight.|$|E
5|$|Such open {{display of}} anti-British {{feelings}} <b>and</b> <b>humiliation</b> prompted the Governor General {{of the time}} Richard Wellesley to recall Knox to India and unilaterally suspend the diplomatic ties. The Treaty of 1801 was also unilaterally annulled by the British on 24 January 1804. The suspension of diplomatic ties also gave the Governor General a pretext to allow the ex-King Rana Bahadur to return to Nepal unconditionally.|$|E

5|$|A {{different}} view of the myth's end focuses on Horus's sole triumph. In this version, Set is not reconciled with his rival, but utterly defeated, and sometimes he is exiled from Egypt or even destroyed. His defeat <b>and</b> <b>humiliation</b> is more pronounced in sources from later periods of Egyptian history, when he was increasingly equated with disorder and evil, and the Egyptians no longer saw him {{as an integral part}} of natural order.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the revolt}} was also fuelled by a general feeling of discontent <b>and</b> <b>humiliation</b> at the {{failures}} of the Angeloi, especially in terms of foreign policy. This much is evident from the— albeit embellished— account of the eyewitness Nicholas Mesarites, whereby John Komnenos's supporters proclaimed that henceforth everything would go well for Romania, that her enemies would be vanquished, and that the kings of all the earth would come to pay homage to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} thirty, Mahavira {{abandoned}} the comforts of royal life and left his home and family to live an ascetic life {{in the pursuit of}} spiritual awakening. He undertook severe austerities of fasting and bodily mortifications, meditated under the Ashoka tree, and discarded his clothes. There is a graphic description of his hardships <b>and</b> <b>humiliation</b> in the Acharanga Sutra. According to the Kalpa Sūtra, Mahavira spent the first forty-two monsoons of his life at Astikagrama, Champapuri, Prstichampa, Vaishali, Vanijagrama, Nalanda, Mithila, Bhadrika, Alabhika, Panitabhumi, Shravasti, and Pawapuri. He is said to have lived in Rajagriha during the rainy season of the forty-first year of his ascetic life. This is traditionally dated to have been in 491BC.|$|E

5|$|Chan Gailey came to Georgia Tech in 2002 after head {{coaching}} stints with the Dallas Cowboys, Samford Bulldogs, and Troy Trojans. Gailey's first team in 2002 managed to win seven games under the quarterbacking of A.J. Suggs. The most notable {{game of the}} 2002 season was an upset of National Title Contender North Carolina State. Georgia Tech rallied {{in the fourth quarter}} to upset NC State and end Philip Rivers's Heisman Trophy hopes. In 2003, eleven Georgia Tech players were found academically ineligible. Despite the academic losses and the playing of true freshman Reggie Ball, Gailey would lead Tech to a seven-win season <b>and</b> <b>humiliation</b> of Tulsa in the Humanitarian Bowl. P.J. Daniels racked up over 300 yards rushing in the effort.|$|E
5|$|Gladiators {{were trained}} combatants {{who might be}} slaves, convicts, or free volunteers. Death was not a {{necessary}} or even desirable outcome in matches between these highly skilled fighters, whose training represented a costly and time-consuming investment. By contrast, noxii were convicts sentenced to the arena {{with little or no}} training, often unarmed, and with no expectation of survival. Physical suffering <b>and</b> <b>humiliation</b> were considered appropriate retributive justice for the crimes they had committed. These executions were sometimes staged or ritualized as re-enactments of myths, and amphitheatres were equipped with elaborate stage machinery to create special effects. Tertullian considered deaths in the arena to be nothing more than a dressed-up form of human sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|A popular lakon named Irawan Rabi ("Irawan's wedding") {{tells about}} {{the love of}} Irawan and Titisari, a {{daughter}} of Kresna (Krishna). While Titisari is engaged to Irawan, Baladewa (Baladeva), Kresna's brother and an ally of the Kurawas (Kauravas), wants her to marry Lesmana Mandrakumara, the son of Durjudana (Duryodhana), initiating a dramatic conflict. The conflict that ensues ends up being three-sided, among the Pandawas, Kurawas and the ogre-kingdom, whose evil ogre-king Barandjana plans to kidnap Titisari. The confusion that follows results in the outwitting <b>and</b> <b>humiliation</b> of the Kurawas. Siti Sendari, the eldest daughter of Kresna and the estranged wife of Abhimanju, {{takes advantage of the}} situation and schemes to bring Irawan and Titisari together, while also mending her relationships with her husband. Though officially Irawan and Titisari are the hero and heroine of the lakon, in reality they are mere spectators, not the movers, in the play. Brandon describes Irawan as a minor character. Irawan is also depicted as unassertive and manipulated by others, which is common in South Asian theatre. Another lakon called Serat Lampahan Pregiwa Pregiwati also relates a tale about the love of Irawan and Titisari.|$|E

Gazidede himself was a lifelong Muslim devotee.|$|R
50|$|There's {{not enough}} art {{to justify the}} sickening reality of Jodorowsky's artistic method.

50|$|Dead Babies (1975), more flippant in tone, chronicles a {{few days}} in the lives of some friends who convene in a country house to take drugs. A number of Amis's {{characteristics}} show up here for the first time: mordant black humour, obsession with the zeitgeist, authorial intervention, a character subjected to sadistically humorous misfortunes <b>and</b> <b>humiliations,</b> <b>and</b> a defiant casualness ("my attitude has been, I don't know much about science, but I know what I like"). A film adaptation was made in 2000.|$|R
5|$|After {{the death}} of Aurangzeb in 1707, the Mughal Empire's {{influence}} declined rapidly as the Hindu Maratha Empire from Deccan Plateau rose to prominence. In 1737, Maratha forces sacked Delhi following their victory against the Mughals in the First Battle of Delhi. In 1739, the Mughal Empire lost the huge Battle of Karnal {{in less than three}} hours against the numerically outnumbered but militarily superior Persian army led by Nader Shah of Persia. After his invasion, he completely sacked and looted Delhi, carrying away immense wealth including the Peacock Throne, the Daria-i-Noor, and Koh-i-Noor. The Mughals, severely further weakened, could never overcome this crushing defeat <b>and</b> <b>humiliation</b> which also left the way open for more invaders to come, including eventually the British. Nader eventually agreed to leave the city and India after forcing the Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah I to beg him for mercy and granting him the keys {{of the city and the}} royal treasury. A treaty signed in 1752 made Marathas the protectors of the Mughal throne in Delhi.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, Sharif Hussein, {{trying to}} garner {{support for his}} planned {{uprising}} against the Ottomans, sent his son Faisal to Damascus to lobby the Syrian notables on his behalf. Faisal, a member of al-Fatat himself, met secretly {{with other members of}} the society, including Quwatli, in the house of Nasib al-Bakri. When the Ottoman authorities learned of the meeting, they ordered the arrest of al-Bakri and his two brothers, Fawzi and Sami, accusing them of treason. Quwatli was charged by the al-Fatat leadership with the task of facilitating their escape, in which he succeeded. In retaliation, Ottoman authorities placed him under arrest, in which he was subjected to torture <b>and</b> <b>humiliation.</b> Nevertheless, Quwatli refused to confess to anything, and his captors failed to implicate him in the operation so they released him a month later. The tremendous pressure of that experience, however, took its toll on the young Quwatli, and upon his release he retired to his country house in Saidnaya and stopped all contacts with members of al-Fatat and the opposition.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{political}} landscape was highly complex and Maya elites engaged in political intrigue to gain {{economic and social}} advantage over neighbours. In the Late Classic, some cities established {{a long period of}} dominance over other large cities, such as the dominance of Caracol over Naranjo for half a century. In other cases, loose alliance networks were formed around a dominant city. Border settlements, usually located about halfway between neighbouring capitals, often switched allegiance over the course of their history, and at times acted independently. Dominant capitals exacted tribute in the form of luxury items from subjugated population centres. Political power was reinforced by military power, and the capture <b>and</b> <b>humiliation</b> of enemy warriors played an important part in elite culture. An overriding sense of pride and honour among the warrior aristocracy could lead to extended feuds and vendettas, which caused political instability and the fragmentation of polities.|$|E
50|$|Trotsky, Zinoviev and Kamenev {{formed a}} United Opposition against the {{policies}} of Stalin and Bukharin but they had lost influence {{as a result of}} the party struggles and no longer posed a serious threat to Stalin. In October 1927 Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled from the Central Committee and at the Fifteenth Party Congress held in December 1927 the remaining members of the left opposition were subjected to insults <b>and</b> <b>humiliations</b> <b>and</b> in 1928 Trotsky and the Left Opposition were expelled from the Communist Party itself.|$|R

There had been disappointments <b>and</b> <b>humiliations,</b> <b>and</b> {{although}} she hated to admit it even to herself, she was in desperate straits. Nevertheless, she was still fighting.|$|R
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the war, one pressing problem was the very high number of unwanted pregnancies of rape victims. Estimates of the number of pregnancies resulting in births range from 25,000 to the Bangladeshi government's figure of 70,000, while one publication by the Centre for Reproductive Law and Policy gave a total of 250,000. A government-mandated victim relief programme was set up with the support of the World Health Organization and International Planned Parenthood Federation, among whose goals it was to organise abortion facilities to help rape victims terminate unwanted pregnancies. A doctor at a rehabilitation centre in Dhaka reported 170,000 abortions of pregnancies caused by the rapes, and the births of 30,000 war babies during the first three months of 1972. Dr. Geoffrey Davis, an Australian doctor and abortion specialist who worked for the programme, estimated that there had been about 5,000 cases of self-induced abortions. He also said that during his work he heard of numerous infanticides and suicides by victims. His estimate of the total number of rape victims was 400,000, twice as high as the official estimate of 200,000 cited by the Bangladeshi government. Most of the victims also contracted sexual infections. Many suffered from feelings of intense shame <b>and</b> <b>humiliation,</b> and a number were ostracised by their families and communities or committed suicide.|$|E
