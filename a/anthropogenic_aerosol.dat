The results foremost highlight the small change in our best estimate of the global averaged all-sky ERF associated with a substantially different pattern of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>aerosol</b> radiative effects from the mid- 1970 s (- 0. 51 Wm(- 2)) and present day (- 0. 50 Wm(- 2)). Such a small change in ERF is difficult to detect when model-internal year-to-year variability (0. 32 Wm(- 2) standard deviation) is considered. A stable estimate of all-sky ERF requires ensemble simulations, the size of which depends on the targeted precision, confidence level, and the magnitude of model-internal variability. A larger effect of the pattern of the <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>aerosol</b> radiative effects on the globally averaged all-sky ERF (15 %) occurs with a strong Twomey effect through lowering the background aerosol optical depth in regions downstream of major pollution sources.

40|$|Aerosol direct {{radiative}} forcing (DRF) {{plays an important}} role in global climate change but has a large uncertainty. Here we investigate aerosol DRF with GEOS-Chem-APM, a recently developed global aerosol microphysical model that is designed to capture key particle properties (size, composition, coating of primary particles by volatile species, etc.). The model, with comprehensive chemistry, microphysics and up-to-date emission inventories, is driven by assimilated meteorology, which is presumably more realistic compared to the model-predicted meteorology. For this study, the model is extended by incorporating a radiation transfer model. Optical properties are calculated using Mie theory, where the core-shell configuration could be treated with the refractive indices from the recently updated values available in the literature. The surface albedo is taken from MODIS satellite retrievals for the simulation year, in which the data set for the 8 -day mean at 0. 05 ° (5600 m) resolution for 7 wavebands is provided.

40|$|Stratocumulus {{clouds are}} {{important}} for climate as they reflect large amounts of solar radiation back into space. However they are difficult to simulate in global climate models because they form under a sharp inversion and are thin. A comparison of model simulations with the ECHAM 6 -HAM 2 global aerosol climate model to observations, reanalysis and literature data revealed too strong turbulent mixing {{at the top of}} stratocumulus clouds and a lack of vertical resolution. Further reasons for cloud biases in stratocumulus regions are the too "active" shallow convection scheme, the cloud cover scheme and possibly too low subsidence rates. To address some of these issues and improve the representation of stratocumulus clouds, we made three distinct changes to ECHAM 6 -HAM 2. With a "sharp" stability function in the turbulent mixing scheme we have observed, similar to previous studies, increases in stratocumulus cloud cover and liquid water path. With an increased vertical resolution in the lower troposphere in ECHAM 6 -HAM 2 the stratocumulus clouds form higher up in the atmosphere and their vertical extent agrees better with reanalysis data. The recently implemented in-cloud aerosol processing in stratiform clouds is used to improve the aerosol representation in the model. Including the improvements also affects the <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>aerosol</b> effect. In-cloud aerosol processing in ECHAM 6 -HAM 2 leads to a decrease in the <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>aerosol</b> effect in the global annual mean from − 1. 19 Wm − 2 in the reference simulation to − 1. 08 Wm − 2, while using a "sharp" stability function leads to an increase to − 1. 34 Wm − 2.

To clarify the effects of aerosols on the atmospheric hydrological cycle through both the aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions, including slow responses, we used the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate-Earth System Models (MIROC-ESM; Watanabe et al. 2011), a CGCM, coupled with the Spectral Radiation-Transport Model for Aerosol Species (SPRINTARS; Takemura et al. 2000; 2002).

Hence, anthropogenic particles produce over coastal and land sites of the central Mediterranean a significant cooling effect. Monthly DRE a values vary from site to site and are seasonally dependent as a consequence of the seasonal dependence of available sun-light and microphysical aerosol properties. At the ToA the monthly average DRE a is −(4 ± 1) W m − 2 during spring-summer (SS, April–September) and −(2 ± 1) W m − 2 during autumn-winter (AW, October–March) at the polluted sites. In contrast, it varies between −(3 ± 1) W m − 2 and −(1 ± 1) W m − 2 on SS and AW, respectively at the less polluted site.
