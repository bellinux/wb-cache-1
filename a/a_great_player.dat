5|$|Gould {{was first}} {{selected}} for Wales in 1885 {{when he played}} at fullback against England. He was awarded the captaincy in 1889, by which time he was playing at centre, and led Wales to their first Home Nations Championship and Triple Crown titles in 1893; that tournament's match against England established Gould as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>player</b> and captain. By the time Gould retired {{he was the most}} capped Welsh centre, a record he held until 1980, with 25 caps in the position. He ended his international career against England on 9 January 1897. The game, played in front of 17,000 supporters at Rodney Parade, was Gould's 18th as Wales captain – a record eventually broken by Ieuan Evans in 1994.|$|E
5|$|In November 1949 {{he joined}} Second Division club Hull City for a {{transfer}} fee of £19,000. He chose {{to join the}} Tigers ahead of bigger clubs like Arsenal and Manchester City who had shown interest in signing him {{due to the fact}} that Hull were managed by Raich Carter, who had been <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>player</b> before and after World War II. Carter did improve Revie's game but was not a success as Hull manager, as City finished mid-table in 1949–50 and 1950–51, before becoming involved in a relegation battle in 1951–52. Teammate Andy Davidson later said Revie failed to fulfil his potential at Boothferry Park as he was not a tough player, and the rest of the Hull team were not physically dominant enough to protect him and allow him to dictate play with his accurate passing. As at Leicester, Revie felt the time had come for him to move on and handed in a transfer request once Carter departed.|$|E

He's the exception to almost every rule." [...] On March 20, James scored 56 points against the Toronto Raptors, setting Cleveland's new single-game points record. With final averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, he was named to his first All-NBA Team.

In a poll of the world's leading players taken some time after Fischer's list appeared, Tal, Korchnoi, and Robert Byrne all said that Lasker was the greatest player ever.

500|$|Arguably the {{highlight}} of the year was the defeat of the Centre Praying Colonels by a score of 24 to 0. It was Centre's first loss to a southern team since 1916.

[...] Before the game, Fincher said [...] "You're <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>player</b> Bo...I feel awful sorry about it because {{you are not going to}} be in there very long—about three minutes."

500|$|On September 19, 1946, an {{informal}} ceremony {{was held in}} which former Leaf great Charlie Conacher presented Ted Kennedy with his No. 9 sweater he had worn during his career. Conacher had been Kennedy's boyhood hero, but when Kennedy arrived Lorne Carr already wore No.9. Kennedy was initially given No.12, then switched to No. 10. When Kennedy heard Carr was retiring, he immediately {{wrote a letter to}} Leaf management requesting No.9.

500|$|Despite Kariya's {{success with}} Canada at the 2002 Olympics, {{he had come}} off the worst {{statistical}} season of his career prior to the national team's summer development camp {{in preparation for the}} 2006 Winter Olympics.

After a strong start to the 2005–06 NHL season, Kariya was one of 49 forwards chosen in October 2005 to Canada's preliminary list of players to be selected from for the final roster. When the team was announced in December 2005, however, he was not chosen.|$|E

The year's only a loss, 45 to 0 to the Irby Curry-led Vanderbilt Commodores, was {{the dedication of}} Stoll Field.

[...] The 1962 championship game between the Packers and Giants featured hard hitting and skirmishes throughout by both players, after which Taylor acknowledged there were [...] "some hard feelings" [...] between the two. Boxing promoter Al Flora, after watching the game on television, offered Taylor and Huff $2,000 for a four-round boxing match {{to be held in}} Baltimore on January 28, 1963.

[...] He reserved special praise for his opponent Vieira however, saying {{a few days after}} the game: [...] "It was my job to try and stop him, but he definitely got the better of me that day. He's such <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>player.</b> He's so fit, and he dictates the pace of a game. There are a lot of things you can learn just by watching him."

Maguire won the third on the pink after O'Sullivan missed the yellow. O'Sullivan won the next with a break of 51, before Maguire made a break of 71 in each of the final two frames.

500|$|The Cubs hired Leo Durocher {{as manager}} in 1966, hoping he could inspire renewed {{interest}} in the team's fan base. Banks hit only 15 home runs; Cubs finished the 1966 season in last place with a 59–103 win-loss record, the worst season of Durocher's career. From the time Durocher arrived in Chicago, he was frustrated at his inability to trade or bench the aging Banks. In Durocher's autobiography, he says:... was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>player</b> in his time. Unfortunately, his time wasn't my time. Even more unfortunately, {{there was not a}} thing I could do about it. He couldn't run, he couldn't field; toward the end, he couldn't even hit. There are some players who instinctively do the right thing on the base paths. Ernie had an unfailing instinct for doing the wrong thing. But I had to play him.

Gallaher's military experience gave him an appreciation for [...] "discipline, cohesion and steadiness under pressure." [...] He was however quiet, even dour, and preferred to lead by example. He insisted players spend an hour [...] "contemplating the game ahead" [...] on match days, and also that they pay attention to detail. Original All Black Ernie Booth wrote of Gallaher: [...] "To us All Blacks his words would often be, 'Give nothing away; take no chance.' As a skipper he was somewhat a disciplinarian, doubtless imbibed from his previous military experience in South Africa. Still, he treated us all like men, not kids, who were out to 'play the game' for good old New Zealand." [...] Another contemporary said he was [...] "perhaps not the greatest of wing-forwards, as such; but he was acutely skilled as a judge of men and moves".|$|E
