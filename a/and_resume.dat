5|$|As was {{the case}} with many of Heinlein's books, Starship Troopers was {{completed}} in a few weeks. It was originally written as a juvenile novel for New York publishing house Scribner; Heinlein had previously had success with this format, having written several such novels published by Scribner. The manuscript was rejected, prompting Heinlein to end his association with the publisher completely, <b>and</b> <b>resume</b> writing books with adult themes. Scholars have suggested that Scribner's rejection was based on ideological objections to the content of the novel, particularly its treatment of military conflict.|$|E
5|$|Not only {{is there}} no reason {{to get rid of}} the Viceroy, but even if no part of Spain {{remained}} unsubdued, the Spaniards in America ought to take it back <b>and</b> <b>resume</b> command over it.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} battle, Tissaphernes {{had arrived in}} the Hellespont and Alcibiades left the fleet at Sestos to meet him, {{bringing}} gifts and hoping to once again try to win over the Persian governor. Evidently Alcibiades had gravely misjudged his standing with the satrap, and he was arrested on arrival. Within a month he would escape <b>and</b> <b>resume</b> command. It was now obvious, however, that he had no influence with the Persians; from now on his authority would depend on what he actually could accomplish rather than on what he promised to do.|$|E
5|$|The {{diverging}} {{interests of}} the League members began to show, and the alliance began to unravel. In 1573, the Holy League fleet failed to sail altogether; instead, Don John attacked and took Tunis, only {{for it to be}} retaken by the Ottomans in 1574. Venice, fearing the loss of her Dalmatian possessions and a possible invasion of Friuli, and eager to cut her losses <b>and</b> <b>resume</b> the trade with the Ottoman Empire, initiated unilateral negotiations with the Porte.|$|E

5|$|Diệm {{was killed}} in a November 1963 coup, {{allowing}} Thi to return to South Vietnam <b>and</b> <b>resume</b> his military service. Soon after arriving home, Thi found himself involved in another coup plot, acting as the link between Khánh and Đỗ Mậu, two generals disgruntled with their position under the military junta of Minh, who oversaw the overthrow of Diệm. Mau was one of the principal tacticians in the 1963 coup; although he did not command troops, he had a thorough knowledge of the backgrounds of the ARVN officers and their strengths, weaknesses and characteristics through his role as Diệm's director of military security, and this understanding had allowed him to engineer the previous coup. Minh's junta feared Mau's shrewdness and tried to sideline him by making him the Minister of Information, a relatively unimportant position.|$|E
5|$|In September, Mary {{was fully}} {{prepared}} to depart for the Netherlands <b>and</b> <b>resume</b> her post {{when she was}} informed of Charles's death.

Both were so severe that her doctors thought that she had died. When Joan visited her, Mary was still determined to fulfill the promise she had given to Charles and assume the regency in the Netherlands, but she was weak and feverish. She died only few weeks later, in Cigales on 18 October 1558.|$|E

Fumiko tracks Akira down and informs him that she is pregnant. Kashiwagi has become distant and haughty and she pleads with Akira for help. Akira arranges for Yuki to seduce Kashiwagi so that the couple might again be on equal terms. Masaru is killed by a rival yakuza. Yuki discovers that she too is pregnant but without Masaru's support she resolves to get an abortion <b>and</b> <b>resume</b> her prostitution career. Akira and Yuki meet Kashiwagi and Fumiko by chance at an abortion clinic where Akira reveals that each woman was impregnated by the other man, to the amusement of the former couple and befuddlement of the latter.|$|E

5|$|The Deutsche Bank Building across Liberty Street {{from the}} World Trade Center complex was later {{condemned}} as uninhabitable because of toxic conditions inside the office tower, and was deconstructed. The Borough of Manhattan Community College's Fiterman Hall at 30 West Broadway was condemned due to extensive {{damage in the}} attacks, and is being rebuilt. Other neighboring buildings (including 90 West Street and the Verizon Building) suffered major damage but have been restored. World Financial Center buildings, One Liberty Plaza, the Millenium Hilton, and 90 Church Street had moderate damage and have since been restored. Communications equipment {{on top of the}} North Tower was also destroyed, but media stations were quickly able to reroute the signals <b>and</b> <b>resume</b> their broadcasts.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{found that}} Train 214 {{had come to}} a stop entirely within the faulty circuit B2-304, making it {{effectively}} invisible to the automatic train control system. Other trains had received speed commands of 0 when traveling through this circuit but had enough forward momentum {{to make it to the}} next circuit <b>and</b> <b>resume</b> detection and receipt of speed commands from the ATC system. Train 214 was going slower than normal because it was being driven in manual mode by its operator, and it came to a stop while remaining on circuit B2-304 and was therefore invisible. Train 112 behind it was given full speed commands by the ATC to proceed on the track. The investigation found that the emergency brakes had been applied by the operator of train 112 when train 214 came into view but it was too late to avert the collision.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} {{partners}} leads the Simpson family to begin arguing and aggressively competing against one another. The tournament takes place, {{and in the}} stands, are leading tennis professionals Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, Venus Williams, and Serena Williams. At the tournament, Homer ditches Lisa for Venus Williams. In response, Marge replaces Bart with Serena Williams as her partner. Ultimately, Serena and Venus replace Marge and Homer with Sampras and Agassi, respectively. This forces the family {{to go back to}} the bench <b>and</b> <b>resume</b> their normal places in the family. As they enjoy the exhibition of top-class tennis, they agree that it is better to watch things than to do things, and Homer offers to buy the family dinner with money he took from Sampras' wallet.|$|E

5|$|The {{secretions}} {{from the}} parasite give the Nemesis massively heightened regenerative abilities, which {{result in the}} creature being almost impervious to damage; although it can be put down with enough fire from small arms, eventually it will repair itself <b>and</b> <b>resume</b> the pursuit of its targets. However, this resulted in unexpected side effects, including damage to the skin {{and the emergence of}} additional tentacles, as well as unpredictable mutations caused by further attacks. In Resident Evil 3, the creature's survival instincts eventually override Nemesis' programming, causing the host's body to reject the parasite and transform into a giant digestive organ. Featuring large central bone protrusions and elongated tentacles, it crawls looking for prey, yet continues trying to complete its mission despite its now diminished intelligence. This design proved to be the most difficult for the game's development team, as they worked {{to try to make it}} appear as unique as possible.|$|E
5|$|A bypass {{platform}} is provided to these polymerases by Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Under normal circumstances, PCNA bound to polymerases replicates the DNA. At {{a site of}} lesion, PCNA is ubiquitinated, or modified, by the RAD6/RAD18 proteins to provide a platform for the specialized polymerases to bypass the lesion <b>and</b> <b>resume</b> DNA replication. After translesion synthesis, extension is required. This extension {{can be carried out}} by a replicative polymerase if the TLS is error-free, {{as in the case of}} Pol η, yet if TLS results in a mismatch, a specialized polymerase is needed to extend it; Pol ζ. Pol ζ is unique in that it can extend terminal mismatches, whereas more processive polymerases cannot. So when a lesion is encountered, the replication fork will stall, PCNA will switch from a processive polymerase to a TLS polymerase such as Pol ι to fix the lesion, then PCNA may switch to Pol ζ to extend the mismatch, and last PCNA will switch to the processive polymerase to continue replication.|$|E
5|$|Cramer's {{reinforcements}} {{arrived in}} the Sidi Azeiz area at 03:00 and reached Fort Capuzzo at 06:30. At around 08:00, he made contact with Kampfgruppe von Herff, but by mid-morning both groups {{had run out of}} fuel. The German advance resumed at 16:00 before being stopped by around 17 tanks of 2RTR. The British reported one German tank set alight and another disabled and that an advance of up to fifty tanks had been halted, while the Germans believed that they had repulsed a strong British tank attack. As nightfall approached, Herff broke off the action and went on to the defensive. He intended to repair his damaged machines, reorganise, <b>and</b> <b>resume</b> offensive operations on 18 May. 2RTR pulled back to Bir el Khireigat, initially followed by two German tanks, one of which withdrew after the other was destroyed. The regiment arrived at Bir el Khireigat, from where it had set out two days previously, at around 02:30 on 17 May.|$|E

5|$|In Kingdom Hearts II, Sora {{and friends}} awaken from their sleep <b>and</b> <b>resume</b> {{their search for}} Riku and King Mickey, {{learning}} of the Nobodies and becoming re-familiarized with Organization XIII. Sora once again travels to many Disney-themed worlds and resolves issues caused by the Heartless and Nobodies, and Maleficent's servant Pete. They reunite with King Mickey and encounter Xemnas, the leader of Organization XIII and Nobody of Xehanort, revealed to be the human form of the Heartless Ansem. The Organization's plan is also revealed: they seek to regain their lost hearts by creating {{their own version of}} Kingdom Hearts from the sum of all the hearts released from the Heartless slain by Sora's Keyblade. The three arrive at the headquarters of Organization XIII and team up with their friends. Ansem the Wise uses a device that dissipates some of Kingdom Hearts' power, but it self-destructs, engulfing Ansem. At the top of the Castle that Never Was, Sora and his friends battle Xemnas. After Sora and Riku defeat Xemnas, they get trapped in the realm of darkness, but a letter from Kairi summons a gateway for them, and the two are reunited with their friends at their home.|$|E
5|$|Neglected in her {{relationship}} with the once-human Manhattan, whose now-godlike powers and transformation have removed him completely from the everyday concerns of living beings and no longer kept on retainer by the government, Juspeczyk stays with Dreiberg; they begin a romance, don their costumes, <b>and</b> <b>resume</b> vigilante work as they grow closer together. With Dreiberg starting to believe some aspects of Rorschach's conspiracy theory, the pair take {{it upon themselves to}} break him out of prison. Manhattan, after looking back on his own personal history, places the fate of his involvement with human affairs in Juspeczyk's hands. He teleports her to Mars {{to make the case for}} emotional investment. During the course of the argument, Juspeczyk is forced to come to terms with the fact that Blake, who once attempted to rape her mother, was in fact her biological father following a second, consensual relationship. This discovery, reflecting the complexity of human emotions and relationships, re-sparks Manhattan's interest in humanity.|$|E
5|$|On December 10, 1943, SEC {{officials}} met in Nashville in {{an effort}} to bring a full football schedule back for the 1944 season. In order to have enough students eligible to participate on a team, the SEC changed its eligibility restrictions to allow for any civilian to play as long as they had not played four years of college football or professionally. At that time, Alabama along with Tennessee and Vanderbilt indicated they might reform their respective teams <b>and</b> <b>resume</b> conference play for the 1944 season. On January 12, 1944, all SEC members, with the exceptions of Mississippi and Mississippi State, indicated their intent to field football teams the following fall. On May 19, 1944, every SEC school with the exception of Vanderbilt (who fielded an informal team) agreed to play a full conference schedule the following fall. Football officially returned to Alabama {{for the first time since}} the 1942 season on September 30, 1944, when the Crimson Tide played LSU to a tie in their season opener.|$|E
