60|$|She {{lay back}} in her chair, {{regarding}} me, her lips slightly parted. All at once the full flavour of her, the superfine quality was revealed after years of blindness.--Nor can I describe the sudden rebellion, the revulsion that I experienced. Hambleton Durrett! It was an outrage, a sacrilege! I got up, and {{put my hand on}} the mantel. Nancy remained motionless, inert, her head lying back against the chair. Could it be that she were enjoying my discomfiture? There is no need to confess that I knew next to nothing of women; had I been less excited, I might have made the discovery that I still regarded them sentimentally. Certain romantic axioms concerning them, garnered from Victorian literature, passed current in my mind for wisdom; and one of these declared that they were prone to remain true to an early love. Did Nancy still care for me? The query, coming as it did on top of my emotion, brought with it a strange and overwhelming perplexity. Did I really care for her? The many years during which I had practised the habit of caution began to exert an inhibiting pressure. Here was a situation, an opportunity suddenly thrust upon me which might never return, and which I was utterly unprepared to meet. Would I be happy with Nancy, after <b>all?</b> <b>Her</b> <b>expression</b> was still enigmatic.|$|E
6000|$|... 'God {{forgive me}} for saying so,' said Miss La Creevy, as a wind-up to <b>all</b> <b>her</b> <b>expressions</b> of anger, 'but I really feel as if I could stick this into him with pleasure.' ...|$|R
60|$|She {{was quite}} real in her anxiety now, {{although}} her attitude of virtuous indignation {{struck him as}} being like <b>all</b> <b>her</b> emotional <b>expression,</b> namely, acting.|$|R
60|$|The {{letter that}} she wrote was so melancholy and repentant, {{that it gave}} great pain to her kind friend, who thought illness alone {{could account for the}} dejection {{apparent}} in the general tone of <b>all</b> <b>her</b> <b>expressions.</b> In answer, she sent a very affectionate consoling letter, begging Lily to think no more of the matter; and though she had too much regard for truth to say that she had not been grieved by the loss of Emma's writing, she added that Lily's distress gave her far more pain, and that her copy would have great value in her eyes.|$|R
60|$|My old Landlady (I {{speak in}} respect to her Daughter) however {{formerly}} my seeming Friend, came in a violent Passion, and wrenching the Door out of my Hands, opened it, and pull'd her Clerico in; and so soon as she had done this, she took his Part, and railed so bitterly at me, that I had no Reason longer to doubt her thorough Conversion, under the full Power of his Mission. However the young one stood her Ground, and by <b>all</b> <b>her</b> <b>Expressions,</b> gave <b>her</b> many Inquirers Reason enough to believe, all was not Matter of Faith that the Clerico had advanced. Nevertheless, holding it adviseable to change my Lodgings, and a Friend confirming my Resolutions, I removed that Night.|$|R
5000|$|She {{made her}} debut in 2012 in B. Jaya's Lovely {{while she was}} still studying. In her second Telugu film Adda she was seen as a fashion {{designing}} student and her performance was well received by critics. The Times of India wrote, [...] "In the lengthy role that she has Shanvi gets <b>all</b> <b>her</b> <b>expressions</b> right". Indiaglitz.com and 123telugu.com called her a [...] "big plus" [...] and a [...] "big asset for the film". She was then signed up by Ram Gopal Varma to play a brief role as Vishnu Manchu's romantic interest in his Telugu political drama Rowdy. In 2014, she made her Kannada debut with the horror comedy film Chandralekha. She played a character that gets possessed by a ghost [...] and received positive reviews for her performance.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the photo}} shoot, the girls {{embodied}} João Machado's plastic art and {{are dressed in}} organic food, such as squid, pig ears, beef and raw salmon. Dayse was disgusted by being dressed in beef, and it showed in her photos; the judges think that she exaggerated <b>all</b> of <b>her</b> <b>expressions.</b> Unlike Dayse, Maira is told {{that she has to}} exaggerate and show emotions. At panel Alinne and Flávia Giussani are told that they have not showed any kind of evolution. Dayse was once again criticized for not handling correctly feedback from the judges. Marianna is also criticized {{for not being able to}} let go of her [...] "good girl" [...] image. Flávia Giussani was eliminated for not showing attitude in her photos.|$|R
60|$|<b>All</b> restlessness in <b>her</b> {{movements}} {{had come}} to an end. She was standing at the further end of the table, which was nearest to the window, in the full flow of sunlight pouring at that moment over her face. Her eyes looked out straight before her--void of <b>all</b> <b>expression.</b> <b>Her</b> lips were a little parted: her head drooped slightly toward her shoulder, in an attitude which suggested listening for something or waiting for something. In the warm brilliant light, she stood before the two men, a living creature self-isolated in a stillness like the stillness of death.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{what is to}} be done?" [...] he continued, staring {{straight}} before him and giving as little heed to my interruption as a hunter riding at a stiff fence would pay to a remark about the weather. [...] "When a man cannot get a knife, he breaks in two an old pair of sheep-shears, and with one of the blades makes himself an implement which has to serve him for a knife. This is how it is with Doña Demetria; she has no one but her poor Santos to speak for her. If she had asked me to expose my life in her service, that I could easily have done; but to speak for her to a man who can read the almanac and knows the names of all the stars in the sky, that kills me, señor. And who knows this better than my mistress, who has been intimate with me from her infancy, when I often carried her in my arms? I can only say this, señor; when I speak, remember my poverty and that my mistress has no instrument except my poor tongue to convey her wishes. Words has she told me to say to you, but my devil of a memory has lost them all. What am I to do in this case? If I wished to buy my neighbour's horse, and went to him and said, 'Sell me your horse, neighbour, for I have fallen in love with it and my heart is sick with desire, so that I must have it at any price,' would that not be madness, señor? Yet I must be like that imprudent person. I come to you for something, and <b>all</b> <b>her</b> <b>expressions,</b> which were like rare flowers culled from a garden, have been lost by the way. Therefore I can only say this thing which my mistress desires, putting it in my own brute words, which are like wild flowers I have myself gathered on the plain, that have neither fragrance nor beauty to recommend them." ...|$|R
60|$|What {{had been}} {{incredible}} from {{the lips of}} men became, in the tone, look, and gesture of a woman, a wonderful truth for Bess. With little tremblings of <b>all</b> <b>her</b> slender body she rocked to and fro on her knees. The yearning wistfulness of her eyes changed to solemn splendor of joy. She believed. She was realizing happiness. And as the process of thought was slow, so were the variations of <b>her</b> <b>expression.</b> <b>Her</b> eyes reflected the transformation of her soul. Dark, brooding, hopeless belief--clouds of gloom--drifted, paled, vanished in glorious light. An exquisite rose flush--a glow--shone from {{her face as she}} slowly began to rise from her knees. A spirit uplifted <b>her.</b> <b>All</b> that she had held as base dropped from her.|$|R
60|$|In {{due time}} we were {{challenged}} by the warders, from the castle walls, and after a parley admitted. I have nothing pleasant to tell about that visit. But {{it was not a}} disappointment, for I knew Mrs. le Fay by reputation, and was not expecting anything pleasant. She was held in awe by the whole realm, for she had made everybody believe she was a great sorceress. <b>All</b> <b>her</b> ways were wicked, <b>all</b> <b>her</b> instincts devilish. She was loaded to the eyelids with cold malice. <b>All</b> <b>her</b> history was black with crime; and among her crimes murder was common. I was most curious to see her; as curious as I could have been to see Satan. To my surprise she was beautiful; black thoughts had failed to make <b>her</b> <b>expression</b> repulsive, age had failed to wrinkle her satin skin or mar its bloomy freshness. She could have passed for old Uriens' granddaughter, she could have been mistaken for sister to her own son.|$|R
5000|$|Tim O’Shei from The Buffalo News {{called the}} show [...] "different - and that’s good" [...] and cited as {{positive}} <b>her</b> <b>expressions,</b> emotions and onstage movements on stage, saying [...] "She physically plays out {{the lyrics of}} her songs". He also compared Mendler to other young stars as Miley Cyrus and Selena Gomez, said she doesn’t have the [...] "pop presence", but it was good, because [...] "she possesses an onstage quality they don’t" [...] and cited personality and earthiness. Volcano Staff from North West Military said Mendler is [...] "freaking cute" [...] and [...] "adorable" [...] and she shows <b>all</b> <b>her</b> emotions.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>expression</b> altered a trifle. A slight frown {{contracted}} <b>her</b> brow. The <b>expression</b> {{of apprehension}} deepened.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>expression</b> {{changed and}} he spread out one hand deprecatingly.|$|R
60|$|Her eyes rested upon his. <b>Her</b> <b>expression</b> was faintly provocative.|$|R
60|$|She half turned <b>her</b> head. <b>Her</b> <b>expression</b> was {{scarcely}} encouraging.|$|R
60|$|The stately {{head with}} its wealth of silvery white hair {{was buried in}} her hands. Her attitude, the agony which quivered in her tone dying away in <b>her</b> final <b>expression</b> of despair like chords of wild, sad music, and above <b>all</b> <b>her</b> {{likeness}} to the man she loved, appealed irresistibly to Helen. A great pity filled her heart. She passed her arm round Lady Beaumerville, and drew her on to the sofa.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>expression</b> {{had become}} uneasy. Suddenly {{she bent down}} towards him.|$|R
60|$|I {{saw from}} <b>her</b> <b>expression</b> that my {{suggestion}} was favorably entertained.|$|R
60|$|Beatrice look startled; {{her face}} grew dead-white and <b>her</b> <b>expression</b> strained.|$|R
60|$|She {{was silent}} for several moments. He studied <b>her</b> <b>expression</b> curiously.|$|R
60|$|Zenobia's {{eyes darted}} lightning, her cheeks flushed, the {{vividness}} of <b>her</b> <b>expression</b> {{was like the}} effect of a powerful light flaming up suddenly within her. My experiment had fully succeeded. She had shown me the true flesh and blood of her heart, by thus involuntarily resenting my slight, pitying, half-kind, half-scornful mention of the man who was all in <b>all</b> with <b>her.</b> She herself probably felt this; for it was hardly a moment before she tranquillized her uneven breath, and seemed as proud and self-possessed as ever.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>expression</b> changed. She seemed, {{for some}} reason, none too well pleased.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} <b>her</b> <b>expression</b> was almost hopeless. She shook her head.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy {{looked at}} Mrs. Jaques, and fancied that <b>her</b> <b>expression</b> was encouraging.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Trafford {{glanced at}} Mrs. Pope's face, but <b>her</b> <b>expression</b> was impenetrable.|$|R
60|$|Helen's {{face was}} transformed, her eyes glowed, {{her lips were}} parted with eagerness. She turned towards Philippa, <b>her</b> <b>expression,</b> <b>her</b> whole {{attitude}} an epitome of eloquent pleading.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>expression</b> changed. She {{was more}} serious, {{at the same}} time more eager.|$|R
60|$|Something in <b>her</b> <b>expression</b> arrested {{his gaze}} and he {{regarded}} the girl curiously.|$|R
60|$|At {{the same}} moment a spasm crossed <b>her</b> face, <b>her</b> <b>expression</b> went blank.|$|R
60|$|Lucy's manner changed, {{and there}} was a hint of {{hardness}} in <b>her</b> <b>expression.</b>|$|R
60|$|She rose to <b>her</b> feet. <b>Her</b> <b>expression</b> {{was one of}} dogged but patient humility.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl had}} gone very pale. Wolfenden, {{watching}} her closely, {{was surprised at}} <b>her</b> <b>expression.</b>|$|R
60|$|Clementina {{looked up}} now. This {{was not what}} she expected. <b>Her</b> <b>expression</b> {{conveyed}} protesting enquiry.|$|R
60|$|When Felicity {{returned}} {{we concluded}} from <b>her</b> <b>expression</b> {{that she had}} news. And she had.|$|R
