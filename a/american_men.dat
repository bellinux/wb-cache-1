5|$|Stanton's {{position}} {{caused a}} significant rift {{between herself and}} many civil rights leaders, particularly Frederick Douglass, who believed that white women, already empowered by their connection to fathers, husbands, and brothers, at least vicariously had the vote. According to Douglass, their treatment as slaves entitled the now liberated African <b>American</b> <b>men,</b> who lacked women's indirect empowerment, to voting rights before women were granted the franchise. African American women, he believed, {{would have the same}} degree of empowerment as white women once African <b>American</b> <b>men</b> had the vote; hence, general female suffrage was, according to Douglass, of less concern than black male suffrage.|$|E
5|$|After the American Civil War, both Stanton and Anthony {{broke with}} their {{abolitionist}} backgrounds and lobbied strongly against {{ratification of the}} Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, which granted African <b>American</b> <b>men</b> the right to vote. Believing that African <b>American</b> <b>men,</b> {{by virtue of the}} Thirteenth Amendment, already had the legal protections, except for suffrage, offered to white male citizens and that so largely expanding the male franchise in the country would only increase the number of voters prepared to deny women the right to vote, both Stanton and Anthony were angry that the abolitionists, their former partners in working for both African American and women's rights, refused to demand that the language of the amendments be changed to include women.|$|E

5|$|Jordan Mouton was {{selected}} as the only U.S. representative in the women's division at the 2008 U.S. Paralympic Trials for Judo.

Greg DeWall, a first-time Paralympian, won a bronze medal in the Men's +100kilogram class.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} <b>American</b> <b>men</b> with {{political}} ambitions {{fought in the}} Black Hawk War. At least seven future U.S. Senators took part, as did four future Illinois governors; future governors of Michigan, Nebraska, and the Wisconsin Territory; and one future U.S. president. The Black Hawk War demonstrated to American officials the need for mounted troops to fight a mounted foe. During the war, the U.S. Army did not have cavalry; the only mounted soldiers were part-time volunteers. After the war, Congress created the Mounted Ranger Battalion {{under the command of}} Henry Dodge, which was expanded to the 1st Cavalry Regiment in 1833.|$|E

5|$|Her {{more radical}} {{positions}} included acceptance of interracial marriage. Despite her opposition to giving African <b>American</b> <b>men</b> {{the right to}} vote without enfranchising all women and the derogatory language she had resorted to in expressing this opposition, Stanton had no objection to interracial marriage and wrote a congratulatory letter to Frederick Douglass upon his marriage to Helen Pitts, a white woman, in 1884. Anthony, fearing public condemnation of the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) and wanting to keep the demand for female suffrage foremost, pleaded with Stanton not to make her letter to Douglass or support for his marriage publicly known.|$|E
5|$|In 1753, Marquis Duquesne, the Governor of New France, sent another, larger expedition. At present-day Erie, Pennsylvania, {{an advance}} party built Fort Presque Isle. They also cut a road {{through the woods}} and built Fort Le Boeuf on French Creek, from which it was {{possible}} at high water to float to the Allegheny. By summer, an expedition of 1,500 French and Native <b>American</b> <b>men</b> descended the Allegheny. Some wintered at the confluence of French Creek and the Allegheny. The following year, they built Fort Machault at that site.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most young}} <b>American</b> <b>men</b> of this era, Bart King came to cricket {{only after first}} playing baseball. He began to play club cricket at Tioga Cricket Club in 1888, aged 15, {{starting}} out as a batsman. Tioga {{was one of the}} lesser Philadelphian cricket clubs. King played his first recorded match for the club in 1889, when he was tried as a bowler due to his physique. He took 37 wickets for 99 runs for the club in the 1889 cricket season.|$|E

5|$|After the American Civil War, Stanton's {{commitment}} to female suffrage caused a schism in the women's rights movement when she, together with Susan B. Anthony, declined to support {{passage of the}} Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. She opposed giving added legal protection and voting rights to African <b>American</b> <b>men</b> while women, black and white, were denied those same rights. Her position on this issue, together with her thoughts on organized Christianity and women's issues beyond voting rights, {{led to the formation}} of two separate women's rights organizations that were finally rejoined, with Stanton as president of the joint organization, about twenty years after her break from the original women's suffrage movement.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the Big Butte Creek area for at least 8,000 years. The Klamath, Upper Umpqua, Takelma, and Latgawa tribes of Native Americans {{inhabited}} the watershed until they were driven out in the Rogue River Wars of the 1850s. On Christmas Eve, December 24, 1855, Captain E. A. Rice along with 34 other men attacked a Native American encampment near the creek's mouth. Eighteen Native <b>American</b> <b>men</b> were killed, all the women and children were captured, and the camp was burned to the ground. Most were relocated to Indian reservations. Non-indigenous settlers first arrived in the early 1860s, and agriculture, ranching, and logging industries quickly developed. Big Butte Creek was named by early settlers for its close proximity to Mount McLoughlin (also known as Snowy Butte), as was nearby Little Butte Creek.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Edward and Wallis Simpson blossomed at Fort Belvedere; the couple spent their first {{weekend at the}} fort {{at the end of}} January 1932, and by early 1935 two rooms had been combined at the fort for her use. Notable interior decorators to work on the fort under Edward included Sybil Colefax, Lady Mendl, Maison Jansen, and Herman Schrijver. Edward and Wallis entertained most weekends at the house; guests present included 'courtiers and diplomats, <b>American</b> <b>men</b> of affairs and English Society, garnished with a sprinkling of statesmen, soldiers and sailors'. Giles Gilbert Scott added a guest wing to the fort after Edward's accession as king in 1936. In 1936 Wallis moved permanently to the fort after receiving threatening anonymous letters, and left Fort Belvedere for the final time on 3 December 1936, a week before Edward's abdication.|$|E

5|$|Three months later, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) {{calls in}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and informs her that four African <b>American</b> <b>men</b> have been kidnapped in Philadelphia. One {{of them has}} been found dead exhibiting depigmentation. A {{specialist}} from the CDC believes that the men have died from a disease, and has requested Scully to investigate the case. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) joins Scully and {{has some of the}} evidence samples from Sanders' autopsy analyzed by Agent Pendrell, who finds a seed from a rare West African passionflower. Mulder takes the seed to his UN informant Marita Covarrubias and asks for her help; she provides him with information on the incident on the plane.|$|E
5|$|When Korea {{was split}} into two {{separate}} countries, North and South, along the 38th parallel tensions {{between the two countries}} were worsened when other countries began to get involved on both sides. The communist country of North Korea was supported by Russia, China and others, while the democratic South was supported by the United Nations and the United States. In 1950 the United States got involved and {{over the next three years}} more than 1.5 million US service members would serve in Korea. During the three years of the war 133 Medals of Honor were presented and although more than 150,000 Jewish <b>American</b> <b>men</b> and women were serving in Korea at that time, not one received the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-five African Americans {{earned the}} Medal of Honor during the American Civil War, {{including}} seven sailors of the Union Navy, fifteen {{soldiers of the}} United States Colored Troops, and three soldiers of other Army units. Fourteen African <b>American</b> <b>men</b> earned the Medal for actions in the Battle of Chaffin's Farm, where a division of U.S. Colored Troops saw heavy action. Another four men, all sailors, earned their Medals at the Battle of Mobile Bay. William Harvey Carney was the first African American to perform an action for which a Medal of Honor was awarded, but Robert Blake {{was the first to}} actually receive the Medal (Blake's was issued in 1864, Carney did not receive his until 1900). It was common for Civil War Medals of Honor to be awarded decades after the conflict ended; in one case, Andrew Jackson Smith's Medal was not awarded until 2001, 137 years after the action in which he earned it. Smith's wait, caused by a missing battle report, is the longest delay of the award for any recipient, African American or otherwise.|$|E
