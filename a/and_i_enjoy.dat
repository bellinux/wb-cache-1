500|$|Within {{his first}} year on Coronation Street, Thompson had acted out scenes that {{involved}} his character stealing a car, graffiting {{the wall of the}} local newsagents, and discovering that his mother's fiancée was having a gay affair with her male best friend. Still impressed with Thompson's acting ability, producers of the series had his contract extended to 2009. Reflecting on {{his first year}} in the soap, Thompson said: [...] "It's been a really strange year and a lot of things have happened. It's been absolutely brilliant.

[...] He added: [...] "My favourite story lines so far have been doing the graffiti and stealing the car. I really enjoyed filming those two." ...|$|E

500|$|Vick was {{activated}} to the 53-man roster in mid-September {{and played}} sparingly {{for the rest}} of the season as McNabb's backup. In week 13 against the Falcons, Vick both threw and ran for a touchdown, his first scores since December 2006. Vick was voted by teammates as the winner of the Ed Block Courage Award in December. The award honors players who [...] "exemplify commitment to the principles of sportsmanship and courage". [...] "It means a great deal to me," [...] Vick said at the time. [...] "I was voted unanimously by my teammates. They know what I've been through. I've been through a lot. It's been great to come back and have an opportunity to play and be with a great group of guys. I'm just ecstatic about that <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>enjoy</b> every day." [...] The Eagles finished the season with an 11–5 record, making the playoffs.

The Eagles lost the game 34–14.|$|E
500|$|Hochuli's {{presence}} {{on the football field}} has created a cult following. His rise in popularity {{is believed to have been}} started by Phil Simms, a former NFL quarterback and current color commentator for the NFL on CBS, who made reference to the size of Hochuli's arms during a telecast. [...] On the Internet, websites that sell Hochuli merchandise as well as blogs with his namesake exist. He is often affectionately referred to as [...] "Hochules", a portmanteau of his last name and [...] "Hercules", in homage to his large biceps. While he is aware of his celebrity status, Hochuli does not understand it. He said in a USA Today interview, [...] "I get a kick out of the notoriety, because I'm just a referee. I'm not the players. The players are the game. They're what this is all about. I get notoriety because I explain things, and I get notoriety because I have a decent physique, which is funny because I'm a shrimp, a peewee compared to those players. Neither one of those things has anything to do with whether I'm a good referee." [...] His recognition extends to the streets, in airports, and in the courtroom. He has been approached by notable athletes such as former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Charles Barkley at the airport. [...] "It never ceases to amaze me," [...] Hochuli told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "The number of people that will just come up to me and recognize me." [...] He appreciates the attention, saying, [...] "I enjoy the fact that there are people who like me as a referee. I hear from a lot of people <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>enjoy</b> that. Like anybody, I like praise. Probably because of my personality, I thrive on that more than other people." ...|$|E

Viv was sensational. And back then, there were things I had to do—I was in the projection room for some reason, and I just couldn't concentrate on it.

2500|$|Vance's two rural Northern California mysteries {{featuring}} Sheriff Joe Bain {{were well}} {{received by the}} critics. The New York Times said of The Fox Valley Murders: [...] "Mr. Vance has created the county with the same detailed and loving care with which, in the science fiction he writes as Jack Vance, he can create a believable alien planet." [...] And Dorothy B. Hughes, in The Los Angeles Times, wrote that it was [...] "fat with character and scene". As for the second Bain novel, The New York Times said: [...] "I like regionalism in American detective stories, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>enjoy</b> reading {{about the problems of}} a rural county sheriff ... and I bless John Holbrook Vance for the best job of satisfying these tastes with his wonderful tales of Sheriff Joe Bain...".|$|E

In 2008 Central Pharmacy, which Aggarwal still owns and operates, was awarded the Best in UK Clarins Gold Salons Award. He believes the key to good business is in customer service, telling Pharmacy Business (9 March 2011): [...] "I enjoy what I do. I have a lot of happiness in what we achieve. I've always had a strong head for business <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>enjoy</b> leadership and keeping customer service levels high. We want to make customers feel how we would want to feel." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before being cast as Erica Kane, Lucci did {{not have}} much success in her acting career. A casting {{director}} discouraged her from pursuing roles on television because her hair, skin, and eyes were too dark. Though Lucci's olive complexion held her back from other acting opportunities, it worked in her favor while up for the role of Erica. [...] "Agnes Nixon, the show's creator, really wanted somebody dark to play this part. She has always been ahead of her time," [...] Lucci said. Lucci debuted in episode 10 of the series. In portraying Erica, the actress drew on the [...] "self-centered" [...] and [...] "haughty" [...] traits she recognized in herself while in college. Lucci said, [...] "I love playing her. I enjoyed playing her when she was a 15-year-old high school girl, the naughty girl in town, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>enjoy</b> playing her now, when she's still the naughty girl, but she's broadened her area of operation to include the entire world." ...|$|E

2500|$|Frontman Kurt Cobain {{was found}} dead in his Seattle home on April 8, 1994, and Nirvana {{subsequently}} disbanded. Grohl received offers to work with various artists; press rumors indicated he might be joining Pearl Jam and he almost accepted a permanent position as drummer in Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Ultimately Grohl declined and instead entered Robert Lang Studios in October 1994 to record fifteen of the forty songs he had written. With the exception of a guitar part on [...] "X-Static", played by Greg Dulli of the Afghan Whigs, Dave Grohl played every instrument and sang every vocal on the tracks. [...] "I was supposed to just join another band and be a drummer the rest of my life," [...] Grohl later said. [...] "I thought that I would rather do what no one expected me to do. I enjoy writing music <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>enjoy</b> trying to sing, and there's nothing anyone can really do to discourage me."
