I think instead the nation should be quiet; black and white, {{and we should be}} in a prayerful mood, which would be in keeping with his life.

25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E

500|$|Moore has {{acknowledged}} the {{narrow range of}} his vocals. He considers his vocal style to [...] " [...] from how I feel when I’m singing, when I'm in the zone of writing lyrics and recording which, a lot of times, comes as the same time. It's sort of an introspective time. A lot of the material lends itself {{to that kind of}} voice <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of spirit." ...|$|E
500|$|Moore {{described}} the lyrics {{on the album}} as [...] "just whatever {{is going on in}} my head... I try to development from a stream of consciousness to something that makes sense". He said the lyrics primarily spoke of relationships, [...] "our way of trying to keep them, the resulting problems <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of thing". Moore cited Roger Waters and Peter Gabriel as influences on his vocal style, [...] "Those guys don’t have the best voices either, but they pull it off then I figured I could do it too," [...] he said. He noted that musically his progressive influences [...] "will always be there" [...] because they influenced all his music, but could not name any other influences as [...] " [...] to so much stuff it just gets lost".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Channel V Australia, he recalled {{that the two of}} them were able to communicate their thoughts about the tracks they developed, [...] "on an organisational level", thus accelerating the process. Madonna was completely involved in the recording which was a surprise for Solveig, since he had expected the singer not to stay more than an hour or two in the recording studio and then leave. Madonna expressed her thoughts about the composition, including the instrumentation to be used as Solveig added, [...] "at some point she wanted to choose the sound of a snare drum or a synth <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of stuff. She was really in the session!" [...] Madonna reciprocated the feelings saying that she liked Solveig's way of working: [...] "He's very organised and methodical in his thinking so I like his work process". The singer also stated that she was able to disapprove something which she did not like without hurting his feelings.|$|E

500|$|... "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)" [...] is an {{alternative}} rock song that lasts for three minutes and 41 seconds. According to the digital music sheet published at Musicnotes.com, the song is composed in the key of G minor and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute, while Lohan's vocal range spans from F3 to D5. When asked about the lyrical content of the song, Lohan revealed, [...] "A lot of people go through family issues, abuse <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of thing. I think it's important to show that other people go through it. [...] I hope [...] see what I say in the song is, 'I love you,' so many times, that I need him and the crazy things in my life. I hope he sees {{the positive side of}} the video rather than the negative. The video is kind of offensive, but it is very raw. He's my father. I need someone to walk me down the aisle when I get married." [...] The single's b-side, [...] "My Innocence", features a similar message to Lohan's father.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with author Cicily Janus, Joseph commented that his perspective has changed {{a great deal from}} when he was younger. [...] He said, [...] "Everything I did was focused on making good music and being a great musician, not running a business. Yet it takes a businessperson to bring music to the masses." [...] But some artists just want to [...] be involved in the music and do not like the added problems or have the personality to work with both. [...] Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their needs and wants. [...] He advises, [...] "...to keep your eyes and ears open all the time. [...] All the information you need is available to you to have a successful career in music, if you're paying attention, and not closed off to anything." [...] He explains, [...] "Time and persistence has shown me that I can succeed at sharing my art with others as a musician while running my own music business.

500|$|Mandi Bierly, also of Entertainment Weekly, also {{praised the}} premiere and drew {{particular}} attention to the scene with Sarah confronting Adam about stealing her idea. She said the scene shows the writers and actors [...] "are not people afraid of letting an awkward, tension-filled scene breathe", <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of realism illustrates the strength of the show's writing and acting. Camille Wright Felton of CNN said she loved the show, and particularly praised the subplot about Haddie learning to drive, as well as Adam's response when Haddie asked if whether {{he and his wife had}} an agreement to ignore each other's flaws: [...] "Yeah, it's called marriage." [...] However, Felton criticized Baldwin's character, which she described as a [...] "single-minded boss who apparently exists as an island and doesn't get that people have families and need to tend to family crises". HitFix television columnist Alan Sepinwall felt the first half of the episode was too uneven in its mix of comedy and drama, but that it was later redeemed mainly by the scenes featuring Max, who he said [...] "is the one character on the show who never feels inauthentic, and he kind of pulls everyone toward him". Sepinwall praised the performance of Max Burkholder as Max, but described William Baldwin's character as a [...] "caricatured playboy boss".|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} bassist Jon Stockman describes the song as being [...] it’s {{very much a}} direct kind of ’sonic’ call to arms, challenging {{people to look at}} how much control we have over our own society as well as our own lives and to remind people {{that we live in a}} democracy, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of system of government has certain rights that we should always be entitled to.

[...] And absolutely not... I mean we co-produced the track and it's not just written on the credits [...] "co-produced by Martin Solveig and Madonna", we literally co-produced the tracks.

TV Guide reported that Jackson attempted to negotiate with the network for a lighter schedule and to be repaired with on-screen love interest Herbst (Elizabeth), but was denied on both accounts. Jackson explained: [...] "I love to work hard but I've been at maximum capacity in terms of mental and emotional output for months on end and it has become too difficult. I am extremely thankful that they wanted to give me all those storylines with so much depth, but there's just no balance. (...) I have a wife and three kids and other things in life I have to think about. I just knew I couldn't sustain the schedule at GH <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of emotion for much longer.

2500|$|Borzou Daragahi Iraq {{correspondent}} for the Los Angeles Times, {{in an interview with}} PBS, questioned the study based on their earlier research in Iraq, saying, [...] "Well, we think—the Los Angeles Times thinks these numbers are too large, depending on the extensive research we've done. Earlier this year, around June, the report was published at least in June, but the reporting was done over weeks earlier. We went to morgues, cemeteries, hospitals, health officials, and we gathered as many statistics as we could on the actual dead bodies, and the number we came up with around June was about at least 50,000. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of jibed with some of the news report that were out there, the accumulation of news reports, in terms of the numbers killed. The U.N. says that there's about 3,000 a month being killed; that also fits in with our numbers and with morgue numbers. This number of 600,000 or more killed {{since the beginning of the}} war, it's way off our charts." ...|$|E

But that kind of behavior <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of mistreatment of holy books [...] and prophets, and the prophets' sanctities, and others' sanctities; this behavior is Israeli and let us say it is Jewish, between quotation marks, - now they will say that this is anti-Semitism - [...] the Holy Quran told us about this people: how they attacked their prophets, and how they killed their prophets, and how they affronted their prophets, and how they affronted Jesus Christ, peace be upon him, and how they affronted Mary, peace be upon her, and how they affronted Allah's great messenger Mohammad, May God exalt and bring peace upon him and his family. This [...] pattern about affronting holy books, and prophets, and messengers, and sanctities; this is their mentality, and maybe they want to push things more and more toward a religious war worldwide." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2014, after a {{television}} series {{extension of the}} One-Shot Agent Carter was ordered by ABC, the short's composer Christopher Lennertz talked {{about the possibility of}} him being involved with the series saying Louis D'Esposito, the One-Shot director also involved with the series, wanted Lennertz involved, before officially signing on to compose for the series that September. On his music for the series, Lennertz said, [...] "I get to mix {{a lot of things that}} don’t often get to go together in terms of period, music, jazz, trumpet, mixed with orchestra, mixed with electronics and brushes on a drum set and things." [...] He researched [...] "what was going on between '46 and 1950 and what it was that would be part of that era ... I knew Count Basie. I knew Glenn Miller, all those things were happening at the time, but then we also figured out that it was sort of changing from big band to smaller jazz ensembles." [...] This led to Lennertz focusing a lot on trumpets for Peggy Carter's sound, [...] "which makes a lot of sense because it’s also very sneaky, and it lends itself to espionage <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of thing". Lennertz introduced a folk choral piece performed by a Russian men's choir during [...] "The Iron Ceiling".|$|E

2500|$|Enrique Morente Cotelo (25 December 1942 – 13 December 2010), {{known as}} Enrique Morente, was a flamenco singer and a {{controversial}} figure {{within the world}} of contemporary flamenco. After his orthodox beginnings, he plunged into experimentalism, writing new melodies for cante (flamenco singing) and jamming with musicians of all styles, without renouncing his roots in traditional flamenco singing, which he kept on cultivating. In spite of severe criticism from the most [...] "purist" [...] amongst the critics and public, [...] "It hasn't been easy. First came the accusations of corruption of the music, of treachery in his struggle to disfigure what was already perfectly coded. When some albums and some categorical evidence of {{his knowledge of the}} classical approach laid these malicious comments bare, then came the most twisted condemnations. That the pace of the compás waned (just get a metronome and see for yourself), that he didn't really make you feel (are there really many true aficionados whose hair doesn't stand on end listening to his caña ‘Eso no lo manda la ley’, ‘La aurora de Nueva York’ or ‘Generalife’, to name three markedly different examples) <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of thing." [...] he was perhaps the most influential contemporary flamenco singer, who not only innovated, but it could also be said that he created tradition: some of his cantes have been performed by other singers such as Camarón de la Isla, Mayte Martín, Carmen Linares, Miguel Poveda, Segundo Falcón and Arcángel. He also is the father of flamenco singer Estrella Morente.|$|E
