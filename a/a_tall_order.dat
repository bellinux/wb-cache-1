[...] Conversely, Burt [...] "was a bit sad that Arrow was robbed the opportunity of having a 100th episode outside of the already considerable demands of the crossover event, which were sometimes at odds with what this episode was trying to do... This episode was trying to do far too much and was therefore a bit of a mess, but it's hard to dislike an hour of TV that is earnestly trying to please its fans in so many different ways."

Thus, the "Global Digital Library " (GDL) advocated by the author {{for a number of years}} can be a technological reality.

While recognizing the importance of many other information infrastructure related problems and issues which are more global in nature, librarians need to be actively participating in working together with other groups in meeting the digital and global challenges. With her own GDL initiative, this author shows how the current seamless GDL prototype has the capability to link many national libraries and some major libraries, archives, museums, and information organizations together. Yet, while technologically the system building is possible, we need to raise a basic question about the readiness of digital "contents " for this global connection. Are we ready to utilize the available global system? Unquestionably, there is an urgent need for global cooperation in "digital " content building and sharing.

40|$|I {{start with}} a brief {{introduction}} to MOND phenomenology and its possible roots in cosmology [...] a notion that {{may turn out to}} be the most far reaching aspect of MOND. Next I discuss the implications of MOND for the dark matter (DM) doctrine: MOND's successes imply that baryons determine everything. For DM this would mean that the puny tail of leftover baryons in galaxies wags the hefty DM dog. This has to occur in many intricate ways, and despite the haphazard construction history of galaxies [...] <b>a</b> very <b>tall</b> <b>order.</b> I then concentrate on galaxy clusters in light of MOND, which still requires some yet undetected cluster dark matter, presumably in some baryonic form (CBDM). This CBDM might contribute to the heating of the x-ray emitting gas and thus alleviate the cooling-flow puzzle. MOND, qua theory of dynamics, does not directly enter the microphysics of the gas; however, it does force a new outlook on the role of DM in shaping the cluster gasdynamics: MOND tells us that the cluster DM is not cold dark matter, is not so abundant, and is not expected in galaxies; it is thus not subject to constraints on baryonic DM in galaxies. The mass in CBDM required in a whole cluster is, typically, similar to that in hot gas, but is rather more centrally concentrated, totally dominating the core. The CBDM contribution to the baryon budget in the universe is thus small. Its properties, deduced for isolated clusters, are consistent with the observations of the ``bullet cluster''. Its kinetic-energy reservoir is much larger than that of the hot gas in the core, and would suffice to keep the gas hot for many cooling times. Heating can be effected in various ways depending on the exact nature of the CBDM, from very massive black holes to cool, compact gas clouds. Comment: 11 pages.
