2500|$|Though the Nie 31 (it {{had been}} flown and {{subsequently}} <b>abandoned</b> <b>well</b> {{before the company}} {{changed its name to}} Nieuport-Delage) was technically a sesquiplane, it could equally well be described as a shoulder-wing monoplane with a small foreplane. Its immediate predecessor was the Nieuport Madon, which had an ancillary lifting surface built around the axle of its wide-track undercarriage. [...] The Nie 31 had a narrower-track undercarriage, but the second wing extended outwards beyond the wheels, which were faired into its upper surface; this wing and the axle were joined to the lower fuselage by a pair of near vertical N-form struts.|$|E

2500|$|The finds {{from the}} {{excavation}} were very few, and of limited help in dating the site. A small iron chain was found, {{consisting of a}} circular ring and remains of five oval links. There were also a few scraps of Iron-Age pottery, and a fragment of a bronze tube {{believed to be a}} [...] "horn-cap," [...] a type of object which it is believed was mounted on the ends of chariot yokes. Hawkes himself believed that the fort was built in the first century BC and was demolished in about 43 AD, possibly by the Romans. Advances in Iron-Age archaeology since the 1930s have now led modern archaeologists to adopt a longer chronology for the site. The site may date from the Early to Middle Iron-Age (c. 5th century BC) and may have started out with a single bank and ditch system. Later the ramparts may have been refurbished, and the outer ramparts were added to the original construction. Many hillforts in southern England had been <b>abandoned</b> <b>well</b> before the Roman conquest, and Buckland Rings may have fallen out use by the 1st century BC. The finds from excavation are stored in Winchester.|$|E

40|$|Unused or <b>abandoned</b> <b>wells</b> are {{a common}} site {{throughout}} Alabama. These wells pose a potential threat to groundwater, which supplies {{at least half of}} Alabama's population with drinking water. It is easy for contaminants to follow the path of these wells directly into our groundwater supply, bypassing the normal filtration that occurs through soil. Common sources of contamination include farm wastes, spills, leaking fuel storage and other chemical tanks, septic system wastes, and stormwater runoff. It is not unusual for people to accidentally pour hazardous waste such as used motor oil into <b>abandoned</b> <b>wells,</b> or purposely use them as a garbage dump without realizing the potential hazard. This is another reason to properly seal unused wells. Seepage through old <b>abandoned</b> <b>wells</b> may contaminate the water for new wells. When an aquifer becomes contaminated, cleaning it up can be very difficult and expensive. Larger diameter, open and unused wells also present a physical hazard for small animals and children.

The {{environmental}} problems in past mining areas, where {{the production process}} was ended, are connected with contaminations coming from past extraction processes and the risks relating to the abandonment of wells and deposits. The risk could be variable depending on such factors as the geological formation and hydrogeological conditions in the analyzed area, and the condition of <b>abandoned</b> <b>wells.</b> The main source of contamination could be improperly sealed <b>abandoned</b> <b>wells</b> and unplugged <b>abandoned</b> oil and gas wells. The {{environmental problems}} could be particularly concern on the area of old historical extraction sites. There are some hydrocarbon deposits, where production i s endedand still {{it is possible to}} see places of wells and remains of an old oilfield infrastructure. Unplugged or improperly sealed wells can result in stray gas migration or contamination of soil, ground and surface and ground waters. The end of well exploitation may cause the risk associated to the restoration of formation pressure. This could be the reason of uncontrolled discharge of gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons into shallow depths. Returning to the extraction from some deposits could reduce the formation pressure and constrain uncontrollable leakages of hydrocarbons. This option seems to be environmentally friendly. Authors of the paper made efforts to evaluate the scale and the range of mentioned disadvantageous phenomena. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

Methods included calculation of annual blood examination rates (ABER, number of slides examined/population), collection of water specimens from potential vector-breeding sites, sorting of villages in categories depending {{on the number of}} <b>abandoned</b> <b>wells</b> within two kilometers radius and review of the DDT spray coverage. Cases were compared with matched neighbourhood controls in terms of personal protection using matched odds ratios (MOR). 7, 303 cases and 17 deaths were reported between April 2005 and March 2006 with a peak during October rains (Attack rate: 50 per 1, 000, case fatality: 0. 2 %).

40|$|Geological {{storage of}} carbon dioxide (CO₂) {{is likely to be}} an {{integral}} component of any realistic plan to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. In conjunction with large-scale deployment of carbon storage as a technology, there is an urgent need for tools which provide reliable and quick assessments of aquifer storage performance. Previously, <b>abandoned</b> <b>wells</b> from over a century of oil and gas exploration and production have been identified as critical potential leakage paths. The practical importance of <b>abandoned</b> <b>wells</b> is emphasized by the correlation of heavy CO₂ emitters (typically associated with industrialized areas) to oil and gas producing regions in North America. Herein, we describe a novel framework for predicting the leakage from large numbers of <b>abandoned</b> <b>wells,</b> forming leakage paths connecting multiple subsurface permeable formations. The framework is designed to exploit analytical solutions to various components of the problem and, ultimately, leads to a grid-free approximation to CO₂ and brine leakage rates, as well as fluid distributions. We apply our model in a comparison to an established numerical solver for the underlying governing equations. Thereafter, we demonstrate the capabilities of the model on typical field data taken from the vicinity of Edmonton, Alberta. This data set consists of over 500 wells and 7 permeable formations. Results show the flexibility and utility of the solution methods, and highlight the role that analytical and semianalytical solutions can play in this important problem...|$|R
