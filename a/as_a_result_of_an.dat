5|$|Americium often enters {{landfills}} from discarded smoke detectors. The rules {{associated with}} the disposal of smoke detectors are relaxed in most jurisdictions. In 1994, 17-year-old David Hahn extracted the americium from about 100 smoke detectors {{in an attempt to}} build a breeder nuclear reactor. There have been a few cases of exposure to americium, the worst case being that of chemical operations technician Harold McCluskey, who at the age of 64 was exposed to 500 times the occupational standard for americium-241 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> explosion in his lab.

These boats would have bigger engines to accommodate the additional passengers. In September 2017, the NYCEDC ordered three new 350-passenger boats for NYC Ferry service to supplement the 20 original boats. Metal Shark would build the new boats for $7 million to $7.5 million each.|$|E

5|$|Blinded in {{both eyes}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> early {{childhood}} accident, Braille mastered his disability while still a boy. He excelled in his education and received scholarship to France's Royal Institute for Blind Youth. While still a student there, he began developing {{a system of}} tactile code that could allow blind people {{to read and write}} quickly and efficiently. Inspired by the military cryptography of Charles Barbier, Braille constructed a new method built specifically for the needs of the blind. He presented his work to his peers {{for the first time in}} 1824.|$|E
5|$|Drugs in the gliflozin class (SGLT2 inhibitors), {{which are}} {{generally}} used for type 2 diabetes, {{have been associated}} with cases of diabetic ketoacidosis where the blood sugars are not significantly elevated ("euglycemic DKA"). This may be because they were being used in people with type 1 diabetes, but in those with type 2 diabetes it may be <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> increase in glucagon levels.|$|E
5|$|Film {{historian}} Howard Hughes suggests that, {{despite the}} implications of a large budget <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> international cast, as well as elaborate set and costume designs, there are several aspects that suggest otherwise. These include several continuity errors and revealing mistakes present throughout the film, and a variance {{in the quality of}} the film stock. In comparison to the Technicolor/Techniscope presentation most Spaghetti Westerns were filmed in, The Great Silence was filmed in the standard European widescreen format and printed in Eastmancolor.|$|E

5|$|Globular {{clusters}} have a {{very high}} star density, and therefore close interactions and near-collisions of stars occur relatively often. Due to these chance encounters, some exotic classes of stars, such as blue stragglers, millisecond pulsars and low-mass X-ray binaries, are much more common in globular clusters. A blue straggler is formed from the merger of two stars, possibly <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> encounter with a binary system. The resulting star has a higher temperature than comparable stars in the cluster with the same luminosity, and thus differs from the main sequence stars formed {{at the beginning of the}} cluster.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, {{the fourth}} season was {{simulcast}} on the terrestrial CTV Television Network. Additionally, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> agreement between Warner Bros. and CTV, {{the first episode}} was available to be streamed from October 30, 2006 at 12:00p.m. ET onwards, through the CTV Broadband Network. In the United Kingdom the season premiered on January 9, 2007 on E4, and in Australia it was broadcast by Network Ten on November 7, 2006 at 8:30p.m. (local time).|$|E
5|$|Late in {{the evening}} of September 18, Karl {{attained}} Category3 status, becoming the sixth major hurricane of 2004. On September 19, Karl continued to strengthen, maintaining a well-defined eye, and strengthening late that day into a Category4 hurricane with winds of 135mph (215km/h) and a minimum pressure of 948mbar. Early on September 20, the storm weakened slightly <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eyewall replacement cycle, weakening back to a strong Category3 hurricane. At this time Karl began to turn sharply northward into a weakness in the subtropical ridge.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{at least}} seven deaths were blamed on the weather, one of them {{directly}} related to weather conditions. One of the deaths was <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tree that fell into a home and crashed into a man in Kannapolis, North Carolina, one <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> faulty generator in a house without power, and the other five <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> traffic accidents.|$|R

5|$|Montauran, on {{the other}} hand, is devoted wholly to the royalist cause, and chafes against the ignorant nobles {{supporting}} it. He fights for the Chouan cause because he believes in it, not for the personal gain sought by the aristocrats in whose midst he works. He gives up the cause for Marie, but only <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unclear series of events, the product of everyone's intertwined double-crossing.|$|E

5|$|A {{week after}} being upset by LSU, Alabama {{returned}} to Bryant–Denny {{and began a}} three-game homestand to end the season by defeating long-time rival Mississippi State 30–10. The Crimson Tide took a 6–3 lead {{in the first quarter}} by trading field goals with the Bulldogs on a 36-yarder from Jeremy Shelley, a 24-yarder from Derek DePasquale and a 45-yarder from Cade Foster. In the second, Alabama reached the end zone {{for the first time on}} the evening after Greg McElroy hit Marquis Maze for a 45-yard touchdown reception and a 13–3 lead. After a punt on the next Bulldog series, an 80-yard Maze touchdown return was called back <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> illegal block on the play by Alex Watkins. On the next play, Mark Ingram took a short bubble screen pass from McElroy 78-yards for a 20–3 lead at the half.|$|E

50|$|Complications {{may occur}} {{immediately}} following the myocardial infarction or may take time to develop. Disturbances of heart rhythms, including atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation and heart block can arise <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> ischemia, cardiac scarring, and infarct location. Stroke is also <b>a</b> risk, either <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> clots transmitted from the heart during PCI, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> bleeding following anticoagulation, or <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> disturbances in the heart's ability to pump effectively <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the infarction. Regurgitation of blood through the mitral valve is possible, particularly if the infarction causes dysfunction of the papillary muscle. Cardiogenic shock <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the heart being unable to adequately pump blood may develop, dependent on infarct size, and {{is most likely to}} occur within the days following an acute myocardial infarction. Cardiogenic shock is the largest cause of in-hospital mortality. Rupture of the ventricular dividing wall or left ventricular wall may occur within the initial weeks. Dressler's syndrome, a reaction following larger infarcts and a cause of pericarditis is also possible.|$|R
