500|$|According to Natalie Nichols of the Los Angeles Times, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] {{reference}} a state of romantic obsession. Beyoncé said that the song talks [...] "about how, when you are falling in love, you {{do things that are}} out of character <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> really care because you are just open." [...] Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] has [...] "such a cauldron of energy," [...] that Beyoncé sounds [...] "loose and sexy," [...] gripped by emotions she [...] "can neither understand nor control." [...] The lyrics are composed in the traditional verse-chorus form. Jay Z opens the song with a brief spoken verse-rap, containing the lyrics: [...] "Yes! So crazy right now. Most incredibly, it's your girl, B. It's your boy, Young. You ready?" [...] After Beyoncé delivers the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] catchphrase, Jay Z continues the monologue. Beyoncé begins the first verse, followed with the whistle-backed chorus. She repeats the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] phrase, leading to the second verse. The chorus follows, giving way to the second verse-rap which contains the lyrics: [...] "Jay Z in the range, crazy and deranged [...] I been inhaling the chain smokers, how you think I got the name 'Hova', I been real and the game's over". The song continues to the bridge, singing: [...] "I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this, / I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care / 'Cuz your love's got the best of me, / And baby, you're making a fool of me, / You got me sprung and I don't care who sees." [...] She then sings the chorus again and the song fades out with the horns.|$|E
500|$|The {{psychiatrist}} {{became a}} scarecrow attaching psychiatric labels. He is feared, is not confided, is not taken into {{confidence in the}} secrets of one's soul and is asked to provide only medications. Psychiatric labels, or stigmas, have spread so widely {{that there is no}} such thing as the media that does not call a disliked person schizo and does not generalize psychiatric assessments to phenomena of public life. The word psikhushka entered everyday vocabulary. All persons who deviate from the usual standards of thought and behavior are declared mentally ill, with an approving giggling of public. Not surprisingly, during such a stigmatization, people with real mental disorders fear publicity like the plague. Vilnius psychologist Oleg Lapin has the same point that politicians and the press attach psychological, psychiatric and medical labels; he adds that psychiatry has acquired the new status of normalizing life that was previously possessed by religion. Formerly, one could say: you are going against God or God is with us; now one can say: I behave reasonably, adequately, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> behave in that way. In 2007, Alexander Dugin, a professor at the Moscow State University and adviser to State Duma speaker Sergei Naryshkin, presented opponents of Vladimir Putin's policy as mentally ill by saying, [...] "There are no longer opponents of Putin's policy, and if there are, they are mentally ill and should be sent to prophylactic health examination." [...] In The Moscow Regional Psychiatric Newspaper of 2012, psychiatrist Dilya Enikeyeva in violation of medical privacy and ethics publicized the diagnosis of histrionic personality disorder, which she in absentia gave Kseniya Sobchak, a Russian TV anchor and a member of political opposition, and stated that Sobchak was harmful to society.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2011, MK Otniel Schneller (Kadima) said to Ben-Ami {{during a}} Knesset {{committee}} meeting: [...] "You are not Zionists <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> care about Israeli interests. Fifty rockets a day are fired on the South and you {{fight against the}} American veto against condemnations of Israel. You are not Zionists <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> care about Israel. Only here in Israel do we determine Israeli democracy, and you cannot determine what Israel's interests are." [...] Ben Ami responded by saying, [...] "An absolute parameter {{has to be the}} recognition of the fundamental right of the Jewish people to their own state. There are plenty of people, even within the American Jewish community, who are anti-Zionist and who do not recognize that right. Second, they must recognize Israel's right to defend itself against threats – Israel must be strong, because it lives in a hard neighborhood, as we've even seen this morning." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 24 November, Suárez {{received}} a seven match ban from the KNVB, with Ajax refusing to appeal. The ban meant Suárez would be unavailable until {{the game on}} 4 February against De Graafschap, but {{would be able to}} play in Ajax's Champions League game against A.C. Milan. Suárez released a video in which he apologised to Bakkal and Ajax supporters, and claimed that [...] "at times like that you play with your heart <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> think".|$|E
2500|$|Fr. Hubert Célis of Halmaal {{was arrested}} for {{harbouring}} Jewish children, but was released after confronting his interrogator with the following words: [...] "You are a Catholic, and have forgotten that the Virgin was a Jewess, that Christ was Jewish, that He commanded us to love and help one another... That He told us: 'I have given you an example {{so that you do}} as I have done'... You are a Catholic, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> understand what a priest is!

Therefore, according to the group, you are not that chatty, but you are either doing the proper performance. However the rater will only get the idea that your behavior is not as bad as other, thus, you will be rate higher.|$|E
5000|$|In the eschatological {{discourse}} of , Jesus says that, when the Son of Man comes in his glory, he will separate people {{from one another}} as a shepherd separates sheep from goats, and will consign to everlasting fire those who failed to aid [...] "the least of his brothers". This separation is stark, with no explicit provision made for fine gradations of merit or guilt: Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry <b>and</b> <b>you</b> gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty <b>and</b> <b>you</b> gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> invite me in, I needed clothes <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> clothe me, I was sick and in prison <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> look after me. ...whatever <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> {{for one of the}} least of these, <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> for me.

2500|$|Dirac's {{quantum electrodynamics}} (QED) made {{predictions}} that were – {{more often than}} not – infinite and therefore unacceptable. A workaround known as renormalisation was developed, but Dirac never accepted this. [...] "I must say that I am very dissatisfied with the situation", he said in 1975, [...] "because this so-called 'good theory' does involve neglecting infinities which appear in its equations, neglecting them in an arbitrary way. This is just not sensible mathematics. Sensible mathematics involves neglecting a quantity when it is small – not neglecting it just because it is infinitely great <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> want it!" [...] His refusal to accept renormalisation resulted in his work on the subject moving increasingly out of the mainstream.|$|E
2500|$|In {{another version}} of the story, told by the Philippines' National Hero, Jose Rizal, Maria {{falls in love with}} a farmer, whom she then watches over. [...] This leads the townspeople say he is endowed with a charm, or mutya, as it is called, that {{protected}} him from harm. [...] The young man was good at heart and simple in spirit, but also quiet and secretive. In particular, he would not say much of his frequent visits into the wood of Maria Makiling. But then war came to the land, and army officers came recruiting unmarried young men. The man entered an arranged marriage so that he could stay safely in the village. A few days before his marriage, he visits Maria one last time. [...] "I hope that you were devoted to me," [...] she said sadly, [...] "but you need an earthly love, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have enough faith in me besides. I could have protected you and your family." [...] After saying this, she disappeared. Maria Makiling was never seen by the peasants again, nor was her humble hut ever rediscovered.|$|E
