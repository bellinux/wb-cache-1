5|$|By the 1930s, older {{historical}} <b>analyses</b> <b>were</b> {{challenged by}} {{a range of}} neo-positivist, Marxist and econometric approaches, supported by a widening body of documentary, archaeological and scientific evidence. Marxist and Neo-Marxist analyses continued to be popular in the post-war years, producing seminal works on economic issues and social protests. Post-modern analysis became influential in the 1970s and 1980s, focusing on identity, gender, interpretation and culture. Many studies focused on particular regions or groups, drawing on new records and new scientific approaches, including landscape and environmental archaeology. Fresh archaeological finds, such as the Staffordshire Hoard, continue to challenge previous interpretations, and historical studies of England in the Middle Ages have never been so diverse as in the early 21st century.|$|E
5|$|The BTO {{analysis}} {{was able to}} determine {{the distance between the}} satellite and aircraft with a relatively high degree of accuracy, while the BFO {{analysis was}} able to estimate the heading and speed of the aircraft, but is sensitive to small changes in input data. To determine the final location of Flight 370, the BTO and BFO <b>analyses</b> <b>were</b> considered in combination with aircraft performance limitations, such as altitude, airspeed, and wind. The BFO analysis was able to isolate the Doppler shift between the aircraft and determine the relative motion of the aircraft to the satellite, which is reduced by the limited range of speeds at which the aircraft can fly and thus a limited set of speed/direction combinations exist that correlate with the calculated Doppler shifts.|$|E

However, there is no systematic comparison of simplified beam analyses and three-dimensional plate analyses so far. In this paper, simplified beam analyses and three-dimensional plate <b>analyses</b> <b>are</b> systematically compared by considering a plate structure under wind loads. Numerical analysis shows that torsional moments from beam <b>analyses</b> <b>are</b> quite different from those from plate analyses and member forces along width directions cannot be exactly calculated from beam analyses.

25|$|Historically, lensing <b>analyses</b> <b>were</b> {{conducted}} on galaxy clusters detected via their baryon content (e.g. from optical or X-ray surveys). The sample of galaxy clusters studied with lensing was thus subject to various selection effects; for example, {{only the most}} luminous clusters were investigated. In 2006, David Wittman of the University of California at Davis and collaborators published the first sample of galaxy clusters detected via their lensing signals, completely independent of their baryon content. Clusters discovered through lensing are subject to mass selection effects because the more massive clusters produce lensing signals with higher signal-to-noise.|$|E

In the main November analysis, all the existing data were reanalyzed to allow adjustments for other factors, such as the Sagnac effect in which the Earth's rotation affects the distance traveled by the neutrinos. Then an alternative analysis adopted a different model for the matching of the neutrinos to their creation time. The third analysis of November focused on a different experimental setup ('the rerun') which changed the way the neutrinos were created.|$|E

However, there is no systematic comparison between simplified beam analyses and three-dimensional plate analyses. This paper systematically compares simplified beam analyses with three-dimensional plate analyses to show disadvantages of conventional simplified beam analyses by considering a plate structure under wind loads. Bending moments and principal stresses from beam <b>analyses</b> <b>are</b> similar to those from plate analyses.

On the other hand, member forces along width directions cannot be exactly calculated from beam analyses because beam analyses give constant distributions of member forces along width directions. Therefore, to rsional moments and width-directional member forces of wind-loaded structures must be calculated from three-dimensional plate analyses instead of simplified beam analyses...|$|R

He and Widor collaborated on a new edition of Bach's organ works, with detailed analysis of each work in three languages (English, French, German). Schweitzer, who insisted that the score should show Bach's notation with no additional markings, wrote the commentaries for the Preludes and Fugues, and Widor those for the Sonatas and Concertos: six volumes were published in 1912–14.

SWIFT is general in that it is parametrized by the top-down and bottom-up analyses it combines.
