50|$|For example, when {{modeling}} {{the flight of}} an aircraft, we could embed each mechanical part of the aircraft into our model and would thus acquire an almost white-box model of the system. However, the computational cost of adding such {{a huge amount of}} detail would effectively inhibit the usage of such a model. Additionally, the uncertainty would increase due to an overly complex system, because each separate part induces some amount of variance into the model. It is therefore usually appropriate to make some approximations to reduce the model to a sensible size. Engineers often can accept some approximations {{in order to get a}} more robust and simple model. For example, Newton's classical mechanics is <b>an</b> <b>approximated</b> <b>model</b> of the real world. Still, Newton's model is quite sufficient for most ordinary-life situations, that is, as long as particle speeds are well below the speed of light, and we study macro-particles only.|$|E

Here we follow this approach to learn to engage a transmission clutch, {{with the aim of}} obtaining a rapid and smooth engagement, with a small torque loss. Using <b>an</b> <b>approximated</b> <b>model</b> of a wet clutch, which simulates a portion of the whole engagement, we first learn an open loop control signal, which is then transferred on the actual wet clutch, and improved by further learning with a different reward function, based on the actual torque loss observed. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|Models {{provide the}} {{foundation}} to statistics and are generally viewed as approximations {{to the underlying}} true state of nature. Data are used to estimate parameters in these <b>approximating</b> <b>models.</b> Assuming there exists a true underlying model, the parameters in the models used for data analysis are actually functions of the parameters of an underlying true model.

The models considered are the monotone contraction operator models of Denardo (1967), which include Markov decision processes and stochastic {{games with a}} criterion of discounted present value over an infinite horizon plus many finite-stage dynamic programs. The approximations are typically achieved by replacing the original state and action spaces by subsets.
