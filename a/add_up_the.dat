5|$|A {{scoring system}} to {{evaluate}} material is to <b>add</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> piece {{values of the}} material on the board. In chess, when a pawn equals one unit, a bishop or knight is worth three, a rook five and a queen nine. These values are {{a consequence of the}} difference in mobility of the pieces. In bughouse, piece values differ because pieces in reserve essentially have the same mobility as they can be dropped on any vacant square. The pawn relatively gains importance in bughouse chess, as its very limited mobility does not handicap reserve pawns. They can for instance be dropped to block non-contact checks. Pawns can be dropped onto the seventh rank, one step away from promotion, which again adds to their importance. Long-range pieces like the queen or the rook lose relative value, due to the constantly changing pawn structure. They {{are also more likely to}} be hemmed in. A valuation system, first suggested by FICS-player Gnejs, often applied to bughouse is pawn=1, bishop=knight=rook=2 and queen=4.|$|E

25|$|Just {{before the}} {{training}} camp commenced, the Drillers {{pulled the trigger}} on another deal that {{came as a shock}} to many. The deal saw Domenic Mobilio shipped to Philadelphia for Rick Titus, a player that only months earlier had walked out on the Drillers, and whom management had stated would never again be welcomed back. While on the surface, dealing a fan favourite and leading scorer for a guy that was considered persona non grata doesn't quite <b>add</b> <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> underlying issue was that Mobilio had a falling out with management which led to the deal being brokered. This would also mark the third time Titus had been acquired by Edmonton.|$|E

25|$|Sraffa {{suggested}} an aggregation technique (stemming {{in part from}} Marxian economics) by which {{a measure of the}} amount of capital could be produced: by reducing all machines to a sum of dated labor from different years. A machine produced in the year 2000 can then be treated as the labor and commodity inputs used to produce it in 1999 (multiplied by the rate of profit); and the commodity inputs in 1999 can be further reduced to the labor inputs that made them in 1998 plus the commodity inputs (multiplied by the rate of profit again); and so on until the non-labor component was reduced to a negligible (but non-zero) amount. Then you could <b>add</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> dated labor value of a truck to the dated labor value of a laser.|$|E

500|$|The {{focus of}} much of Cardus's cricket writing was the Lancashire side of the inter-war years, and in {{particular}} their twice-yearly battles with rivals Yorkshire. His eye was as much on the players and their personalities as on the game, on [...] "the match within the match", with the actual scores treated as secondary. Cardus justified this: [...] "Do I <b>add</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> notes of a Mozart [...] "Vivace" [...] to evaluate the music?" [...] To meet Cardus's requirements, the players were sometimes [...] "enlarged", notably Emmott Robinson, the veteran Yorkshire all-rounder of the 1920s who through Cardus's pen became [...] "the apotheosis of Yorkshire cricket and Yorkshire character". In the 1930s, Cardus's style became less effusive, as his older heroes were replaced by players with, in his view, less romantic appeal. Bradman was an exception; after his exploits in the England versus Australia Test series of 1930 Cardus described the Australian as [...] "an incredible exponent who in himself sums up all the skill and experience that have gone before him... he has kindled grand bonfires of batsmanship for us".|$|E

2500|$|Neoclassical economists {{assumed that}} there was no real problem here.

But Sraffa [...] pointed out that this financial measure of the amount of capital is determined partly by the rate of profit. This is a problem because neoclassical theory tells us that this rate of profit is itself supposed to be determined by the amount of capital being used. There is circularity in the argument. A falling profit rate has a direct effect on the amount of capital; it does not simply cause greater employment of it.|$|E

2500|$|Computationally, {{this method}} {{involves}} computing the quantile {{function of the}} distribution — in other words, computing the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the distribution (which maps a number in the domain to a probability between 0 and 1) and then inverting that function. This {{is the source of}} the term [...] "inverse" [...] or [...] "inversion" [...] in most of the names for this method. Note that for a discrete distribution, computing the CDF is not in general too difficult: we simply <b>add</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> individual probabilities for the various points of the distribution. For a continuous distribution, however, we need to integrate the probability density function (PDF) of the distribution, which is impossible to do analytically for most distributions (including the normal distribution). As a result, this method may be computationally inefficient for many distributions and other methods are preferred; however, it is a useful method for building more generally applicable samplers such as those based on rejection sampling.|$|E

[...] One {{problem is that}} the clerks who compiled this document [...] "were but human; they were frequently forgetful or confused." [...] The use of Roman numerals also led to countless mistakes. Darby states, [...] "Anyone who attempts an arithmetical exercise in Roman numerals soon sees something of the difficulties that faced the clerks." [...] But more important are the numerous obvious omissions, and ambiguities in presentation. Darby first cites F. W. Maitland's comment following his compilation of a table of statistics from material taken from the Domesday Book survey, [...] "it will be remembered that, as matters now stand, two men not unskilled in Domesday might <b>add</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> number of hides in a county and arrive at very different results because they would hold different opinions as to the meanings of certain formulas which are not uncommon."

The two may not be quite the same thing, and how near the record was to reality we can never know." ...|$|E
2500|$|Canada Post use 13 digit {{alphanumeric}} tracking numbers / barcodes {{for their}} pre-printed labels. [...] Bar codes consist of two letters, followed by eight sequence digits, and a ninth digit {{which is the}} check digit. The first two letters are the type of service (RN for registered mail, PG for express post envelopes). The last two characters are the letters CA. [...] The check digit ignores the letters and only concern itself with the first 8 numeric digits. The scheme is to multiply each of those 8 digits by a different weighting factor, (8 6 4 2 3 5 9 7). <b>Add</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> total {{of all of these}} multiplications and divide by 11. [...] The remainder after dividing by 11 gives a number from 0 to 10. Subtracting this from 11 gives a number from 1 to 11. [...] That result is the check digit, except in the two cases where it is 10 or 11. [...] If 10 it is then changed to a 0, and if 11 then it is changed to a 5. [...] The check digit may be used to verify if a barcode scan is correct, or if a manual entry of the barcode is correct. The system of barcode digit checking is referred to as Modulo 11 or Modulus 11 digit calculation.|$|E
