5|$|Chrysippus {{regarded}} bodies, surfaces, lines, places, {{the void}} and time as all being infinitely divisible. He determined {{one of the}} principal features of the infinite set: since a man and a finger have an infinite number of parts as do the universe and a man, it cannot be said that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> more parts than his finger, nor that the universe has more parts than a man.|$|E
5|$|The child's sex can be {{influenced}} by factors that affect temperature, including the weather, the wind direction, diet, and the father's age. Features other than sex also depend on whether the semen overpowers the menses, so if <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> strong semen, he will have sons who resemble him, while if the semen is weak, he will have daughters who resemble their mother.|$|E

It consists of performance footage of the trio in a warehouse {{in front of a}} wall decorated with photographs. In between verses, the photos' origins are explored through the different perspectives of individuals near the band. As the band prepares to play a show, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> a conversation with a girl and is subsequently left alone. In another, while DeLonge and Hoppus read magazines inside a late-night convenience store, a melancholy woman attempts to make a call via a pay phone. Other montages show the trio in the company of friends and practicing, a man looking out upon the sea, and a solitary man deserted by others at an outdoor restaurant. The final montage consists of personal photos from the band's past.|$|E

25|$|Polygyny is the {{practice}} wherein <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> {{more than one}} wife at the same time. The vast majority of polygamous marriages are polygynous.

25|$|However, neither {{group of}} {{countries}} was pro-gender {{equality in the}} sense that policies aimed at equal rights between the sexes are popular. In Arab countries, 82% of survey respondents believe that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> more right to a job than a woman while 63% of respondents from the non-Arab countries felt the same way. These researchers attributed these attitudes to the strong religious identity and adherence of respondents thus implicating Islam in promoting gender inequality in majority Muslim nations.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} Shari'a {{criminal law}} {{men and women}} are treated differently with regard to evidence and bloodmoney. The testimony of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> twice the strength of that of a woman. However, with regard to hadd offences and retaliation, the testimonies of female witnesses are not admitted at all. A number of Muslim-majority countries, particularly in the Arab world, presently treat a woman's testimony as half of a man's in certain cases, mainly in family disputes adjudicated based on Islamic law.|$|E
25|$|Males {{are portrayed}} in the media as having to have strong, muscular, chiseled bodies {{in order to be}} {{successful}} in life. Competitive sports have also taken on this depiction by building a sense of masculinity within each male sporting event, as well as providing a venue for violence and aggression that is not frowned upon as {{it would be in the}} public eye. The magnitude of success <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> is what measures their amount of masculinity, which is then glorified in the media.|$|E

25|$|The album {{marked the}} first of several future collaborations by Scott-Heron with {{musician}} Brian Jackson. It is one of Scott-Heron's most critically acclaimed albums and one of the Flying Dutchman label's best-selling LP's. Earning modest success upon its release, Pieces of <b>a</b> <b>Man</b> <b>has</b> since received retrospective notice and praise from critics. Music writers have noted Scott-Heron's and Jackson's musical fusion of soul, jazz-funk, and proto-rap styles on the album and its influence on subsequent dance and hip hop music. The album was reissued on compact disc by RCA Records in 1993.|$|E
25|$|Illicit sex is {{sometimes}} penalized by 60 lashes. 80 lashes {{is the standard}} amount for anyone sentenced to flogging in several emirates. Sharia courts have penalized domestic workers with floggings. In October 2013, a Filipino housemaid was sentenced to 100 lashes for theft committed after her employer discovered her illegitimate pregnancy. Drunk-driving is strictly illegal and punishable by 80 lashes; many expats have been sentenced to 80 lashes for drunk-driving.

25|$|The Middle Assyrian Law Codes (1075 BC) state: If <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> {{intercourse}} with his brother-in-arms, they shall turn {{him into a}} eunuch. This is the earliest known law condemning the act of male-to-male intercourse in the military. Despite these laws, homosexuality {{was an integral part}} of temple life in parts of Mesopotamia, and no blame appears to have attached to its practice outside of worship. Some kings had male lovers — both Zimri-lin (king of Mari) and Hammurabi (king of Babylon) slept with men. Some Assyrian priests were gay men who cross-dressed.

25|$|Valjean learns <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> been wrongly {{identified}} as him, and reveals his true identity {{to a court}} {{before returning to the}} dying Fantine, promising to care for Cosette. Javert arrives but Valjean escapes, finding Cosette and pays Fantine’s debts to the Thénardiers. Valjean and Cosette flee Javert, hiding in a convent, aided by the worker Valjean rescued before. Nine years later, Valjean has become a philanthropist and helps the poor in Paris. General Lamarque, the only government official sympathetic to the poor, dies, and a group of revolutionists called the Friends of the ABC plot to rebel against the monarchy. Marius Pontmercy, a member of the Friends, encounters Cosette and they fall in love, asking Éponine, the Thénardiers’ daughter to help find her.|$|E
25|$|During sexual intercourse, {{most women}} {{experience}} involuntary vaginal contractions. The contraction causes the pelvic muscles to tighten around the penis, {{which in turn}} increases the level of her partner's arousal and sexual frenzy and results in the man increasing the pace and force of thrusts as he approaches orgasm; which in turn further increases the woman's vaginal contraction. After <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> achieved orgasm, he will normally collapse onto the woman and will normally not be capable of further thrusting. Some men try to control their orgasm until their female partner also orgasms, {{but this is not}} always achieved. At times, a woman can achieve orgasm after the man has ceased thrusting by contracting her vaginal muscles and with pelvic movements, or the couple may change to another position that enables the woman to continue thrusting until she has reached orgasm, such as a woman on top position.|$|E
25|$|Laws on {{domestic}} violence vary by country. While {{it is generally}} outlawed in the Western world, {{this is not the}} case in many developing countries. For instance, in 2010, the United Arab Emirates's Supreme Court ruled that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>has</b> the right to physically discipline his wife and children as long as he does not leave physical marks. The social acceptability of domestic violence also differs by country. While in most developed countries domestic violence is considered unacceptable by most people, in many regions of the world the views are different: according to a UNICEF survey, the percentage of women aged 15–49 who think that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife under certain circumstances is, for example: 90% in Afghanistan and Jordan, 87% in Mali, 86% in Guinea and Timor-Leste, 81% in Laos, 80% in Central African Republic. Refusing to submit to a husband's wishes is a common reason given for justification of violence in developing countries: for instance 62.4% of women in Tajikistan justify wife beating if the wife goes out without telling the husband; 68% if she argues with him; 47.9% if she refuses to have sex with him.|$|E
