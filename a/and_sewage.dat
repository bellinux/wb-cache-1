5|$|Contaminants {{that are}} {{discharged}} into {{the marine environment}} accumulate in the bodies of marine mammals when they are stored unintentionally in their blubber along with energy. Contaminants that {{are found in the}} tissues of marine mammals include heavy metals, such as mercury and lead, but also organochlorides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. For example, these can cause disruptive effects on endocrine systems; impair the reproductive system, and lower the immune system of individuals, leading to a higher number of deaths. Other pollutants such as oil, plastic debris <b>and</b> <b>sewage</b> threaten the livelihood of marine mammals.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, the {{compound}} {{was used by}} the Turkish army and its allies as a barracks. From 1921 to 1927, Theodor Schneller resumed management of the orphanage, overseeing the modernization of the property with electrical <b>and</b> <b>sewage</b> installations, as well as new machinery for the various workshops. His son Ernst directed the orphanage from 1927 until its confiscation by the British army in 1940. The orphanage's German funding sources were severely curtailed during the 1930s when the Nazi government of Germany banned citizens from sending funds abroad.|$|E
50|$|The MWRA {{was created}} in 1985 <b>and</b> assumed <b>sewage</b> <b>and</b> {{wastewater}} treatment functions from the former MDC (Metropolitan District Commission), now the DCR (Department of Conservation and Recreation), which still maintains the watershed lands.|$|R

5|$|Air pollution, lack {{of proper}} waste {{management}} infrastructure and degradation of water bodies {{are the major}} environmental issues in Coimbatore. There is a sewage treatment plant at Ukkadam with the capacity to process 70 million litres of sewage water per day. Garbage is collected by the corporation <b>and</b> <b>sewage</b> is pumped into the water tanks and the Noyyal river through streams. This along with garbage dumping and encroachments has led to degradation of the water bodies and depletion in the groundwater table. The tanks are renovated by the city's environmental groups with their own fund-raising and the corporation. The corporation is responsible and involved in clearing encroachment of the tanks. Siruthuli, an environmental organisation founded by the city's industrial houses, undertakes de-silting of tanks and cleaning of the Noyyal river. Environment Conservation Group based {{out of the city}} is also involved in conservation of trees and wetlands, monitoring wildlife crime and conducting awareness sessions for students.|$|E
5|$|Archaea were {{initially}} viewed as extremophiles living in harsh environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes, {{but they have}} since been found in {{a broad range of}} habitats, including soils, oceans, and marshlands. They are also part of the human microbiota, found in the colon, oral cavity, and skin. Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in plankton {{may be one of the}} most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. Archaea are a major part of Earth's life and may play roles in both the carbon cycle and the nitrogen cycle. No clear examples of archaeal pathogens or parasites are known, but they are often mutualists or commensals. One example is the methanogens that inhabit human and ruminant guts, where their vast numbers aid digestion. Methanogens are also used in biogas production <b>and</b> <b>sewage</b> treatment, and biotechnology exploits enzymes from extremophile archaea that can endure high temperatures and organic solvents.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{power is}} {{supplied}} within the city by PNM Resources. PNM also provides electrical power in the Tularosa Basin, while Otero County Electric Cooperative, a member cooperative of Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association and of Touchstone Energy, serves {{other areas of the}} county. Natural gas is supplied within the city by New Mexico Gas Company. Severn Trent operates both the water <b>and</b> <b>sewage</b> treatment facilities for the City of Alamogordo. Severn Trent maintains all water storage facilities, booster pump stations, city wells and treats the waste water to be re-used by the city to water the parks, Desert Lakes Golf Course and is sold to construction companies for dust control. Rural houses have individual wells.|$|E

5|$|Local {{residents}} were evicted, including 1,200 {{people who lived}} in shacks around the barracks. Around 300 Jewish residents of Oświęcim were brought in to lay foundations. From 1940 to 1941, 17,000 Polish and Jewish residents of the western districts of Oświęcim were expelled from places adjacent to the camp. The Germans also ordered expulsions of Poles from the villages of Broszkowice, Babice, Brzezinka, Rajsko, Pławy, Harmęże, Bór, and Budy to the General Government. German citizens were offered tax concessions and other benefits if they would relocate to the area. By October 1943, more than 6,000 Reich Germans had arrived. The Nazis planned to build a model modern residential area for incoming Germans, including schools, playing fields, and other amenities. Some of the plans went forward, including the construction of several hundred apartments, but many were never fully implemented. Basic amenities such as water <b>and</b> <b>sewage</b> disposal were inadequate, and water-borne illnesses were commonplace.|$|E
5|$|Many {{substances}} {{enter the}} sea {{as a result}} of human activities. Combustion products are transported in the air and deposited through precipitation. Agricultural, industrial, <b>and</b> <b>sewage</b> outflows contribute heavy metals, pesticides, PCBs, disinfectants, cleaning products, and other synthetic chemicals. These become concentrated in the surface film and in marine sediment, especially estuarine mud. The result of all this contamination is largely unknown because of the large number of substances involved and the lack of information on their biological effects. The heavy metals of greatest concern are copper, lead, mercury, cadmium, and zinc which may be accumulated by marine invertebrates. They are then passed up the food chain.|$|E
5|$|Nicole also wreaked {{widespread}} property damage: of the 2,169 homes affected, 474 sustained {{severe damage}} while 54 were beyond repair. The losses totaled J$274.3million (US$3.2 million), J$75.6 million (US$890,000) hereof to replace destroyed housing units. With {{much of the}} island's crops and livestock washed away, including 40 percent of the season's banana produce, the agricultural sector suffered J$576.5 million (US$6.8million) in losses. The storm had a discernible impact on the environment, which {{plays a crucial role}} in the Jamaica's economy and tourism sectors. Surface runoff and spills along industrial zones <b>and</b> <b>sewage</b> systems infiltrated large stretches of land, leading to soil contamination, coastal erosion, and deteriorated ecosystems. In addition, there were traces of light damage to vegetation, such as uprooted trees.|$|E

5|$|On December 17, 1997, President Bill Clinton {{declared}} Guam {{a federal}} disaster area, making it eligible for federal assistance. One week later, a disaster declaration was ordered for the Northern Mariana Islands. Ultimately, FEMA received 14,770Individual Assistance Applications from residents on Guam. In turn, FEMA provided the residents with over $27million in assistance (1997USD, $39million 2015USD). The entire island of Guam was left without power after Paka. Water <b>and</b> <b>sewage</b> systems on Guam were directly affected minimally by the typhoon. With {{the usage of}} power generators, most areas of the island had water pumping capabilities {{within a few days}} after the typhoon. The Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport was partially reopened to daytime flights a day after the typhoon, and by a week after the passage of Paka the airport was fully re-opened.|$|E
5|$|Other {{sectors of}} society were {{negatively}} affected too. By 2005, an estimated 80% of Zimbabwe's population were unemployed, and by 2008 only 20% of children were in schooling. The breakdown of water supplies <b>and</b> <b>sewage</b> systems resulted in a cholera outbreak in late 2008, with over 98,000 cholera cases in Zimbabwe between August 2008 and mid-July 2009. The ruined economy also impacted the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the country; by 2008 the HIV/AIDS rate for individuals aged between 15 and 49 was 15.3%. In 2007, the World Health Organisation declared the average life expectancy in Zimbabwe to be 34 for women and 36 for men, down from 63 and 54 respectively in 1997. The country's lucrative tourist industry was decimated, {{and there was a}} rise in poaching, including of endangered species. Mugabe directly exacerbated this problem; he ordered the killing of 100 elephants to provide meat for an April 2007 feast.|$|E
5|$|Students in the {{residential}} school system were faced with a multitude of abuses from teachers and administrators, including sexual and physical assault. They suffered from malnourishment and harsh discipline {{that would not have}} been tolerated in any other school system. Corporal punishment was often justified by a belief that it was the only way to save souls, civilize the savage, or punish and deter runaways – whose injuries or death sustained in their efforts to return home would become the legal responsibility of the school. Overcrowding, poor sanitation, inadequate heating, and a lack of medical care led to high rates of influenza and tuberculosis; in one school, the death rate reached 69%. Federal policies that tied funding to enrollment numbers led to sick children being enrolled in order to boost numbers, thus introducing and spreading disease. The problem of unhealthy children was further exacerbated by the conditions of the schools themselves – overcrowding and poor ventilation, water quality <b>and</b> <b>sewage</b> systems.|$|E

5|$|Studies of {{the water}} quality of the lake in 1983–84 {{indicate}} a decline in quality since the 1965–66 analysis. Scientific research over the years also reveal that Telbal, Botkal, <b>and</b> <b>sewage</b> drains are responsible for a substantial influx of nitrogen and phosphorus into the lake. Quantitatively, fifteen drains and several other sources have released a total of 156.62 tonnes (56.36 tonnes by drains alone) of phosphorus, and 241.18 tonnes of inorganic nitrogen into the lake from a discharge of 11.701 million cubic metres /year. Non-point sources, such as seepage and diffused runoff, also add to this pollution and have been recorded as further adding 4.5 tonnes of total phosphates and 18.14 tonnes of nitrogen (NO3–N and NH4–N) to the lake. Based on the values mentioned above, it has been inferred that the water quality of the lake has deteriorated.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} impacts from Igor {{were attributed to}} torrential rains, which led to excessive runoff and flash flooding. Several rivers rose to record levels across the Bonavista and Burin Peninsulas where many roads were washed out. Entire bridges, homes and portions of roads were destroyed. In some instances, flood waters were higher than entire homes. In response to the widespread floods, Newfoundland Power Inc. warned residents who still had power by the afternoon of September21 to turn off their main electrical panel if water enters their basement. Parts of St. Bernard's – Jacques Fontaine had to be evacuated by boat during the storm as rising water flooded {{some areas of the}} small town. Portions of Clarenville had to be evacuated under similar circumstances after a state of emergency was declared for the town. Water <b>and</b> <b>sewage</b> lines in Sunnyside broke due to flooding. In Glovertown, downed power lines sparked two fires during the storm, both of which were put out by firefighters without injuries.|$|E
5|$|Upon making {{landfall}} in North Carolina, Doria {{produced a}} storm tide of 2feet (0.6m) above normal at Cape Fear. Sustained winds {{in the state}} peaked at 41mph (66km/h) in Hatteras, while gusts reached 69mph (111km/h) in Atlantic Beach. In most areas, wind damage was minimal. Tropical Storm Doria dropped moderate rainfall across the state, including a report of 4.17inches (106mm) in Cape Hatteras. Over 5inches (125mm) of rain fell around the Albemarle Sound and near New Bern. The rainfall led to flooding and mudslides, which blocked roads and highways. In localized areas, the flooding caused severe damage to roads and houses. Flooding from Doria also damaged water <b>and</b> <b>sewage</b> systems. Rainfall in the state persisted for twoweeks {{after the passage of}} Doria.|$|E
