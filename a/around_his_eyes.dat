500|$|Media reports {{stated that}} Jackson's autopsy {{reported}} one scar beside {{each of his}} nostrils, [...] one scar behind each of his ears, and two scars on his neck, [...] "probably" [...] from cosmetic surgery, plus cosmetic tattoos on his eyebrows, <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and lips, and on his scalp (at his receding hairline).|$|E
500|$|Initially, Lincoln's {{features}} were calm and his breathing slow and steady. Later {{one of his}} eyes became swollen and {{the right side of}} his face discolored. Maunsell Bradhurst Field wrote in a letter to The New York Times that the President then started [...] "breathing regularly, but with effort, and did not seem to be struggling or suffering.". As he neared death, Lincoln's appearance became [...] "perfectly natural" [...] (except for the discoloration <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes).</b>|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} tales {{surrounding}} Bedell-Sivright, {{and it is}} difficult to separate fact from fiction. He had a reputation for aggression, and in 1909 became Scottish amateur boxing champion. After one international he rugby tackled a cart horse in Princes Street in Edinburgh after apparently laying down on a city tram track – this held up the traffic for an hour as no policeman would approach him. It is not clear exactly where Bedell-Sivright picked up the nickname [...] "Darkie". One explanation is that it was due to [...] "cynical" [...] tactics he employed as captain, the other is that it was due to the dark rings <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In {{one scene}} where Daskawisz {{was wearing the}} burlap flour sack, part of the flour sack was {{flapping}} at <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> so the crew used tape inside the eye area {{to prevent it from}} flapping. Daskawisz received rug burns <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> from the tape from wearing the rough flour sack material for hours. [...] The use of the sack hood was similar to the 1976 film The Town That Dreaded Sundown.|$|R
500|$|Depp wears a dreadlock wig in a rock-and-roll {{approach}} to a pirate aesthetic. He wears a red bandanna and numerous objects in his hair, influenced by Keith Richards' habit of collecting souvenirs from his travels; Sparrow's decorations include his [...] "piece of eight". Sparrow wears kohl <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> which was inspired by Depp's study of nomads, whom he compared to pirates, and he wore contacts that acted as sunglasses. Sparrow has several gold teeth, two of which belong to Depp, although they were applied during filming. Depp initially forgot to have them removed after shooting The Curse of the Black Pearl, and wore them throughout the shooting of the sequels. Like all aspects of Depp's performance, Disney initially expressed great concern over Depp's teeth. Sparrow wears his goatee in two braids. Initially wire was used in them, but the wires were abandoned because they made the braids stick up when Depp lay down. Sparrow has numerous tattoos, and has been branded a pirate on his right arm by Cutler Beckett, underneath a tattoo of a sparrow.|$|E
500|$|Depp {{created his}} own image of Todd. Heavy purple and brown make-up was applied <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> to suggest fatigue and rage, as if [...] "he's never slept". Burton said of the {{character}} Sweeney Todd, [...] "We always saw him as a sad character, not a tragic villain or anything. He's basically a dead person when you meet him; the only thing that's keeping him going is the one single minded thing which is tragic. You don't see anything else around him." [...] Depp said of the character, [...] "He makes Sid Vicious look like the innocent paper boy. He's beyond dark. He's already dead. He's been dead for years." [...] Depp also commented on the streak of white in Todd's hair, saying, [...] "The idea was that he'd had this hideous trauma, from being sent away, locked away. That streak of white hair became the shock of that rage. It represented his rage over what had happened. It's certainly {{not the first time}} anyone's used it. But it's effective. It tells a story all by itself. My brother had a white spot growing up, and his son has this kind of shock of white in his hair." ...|$|E
500|$|Captain Davy Jones had {{originally}} been designed with chin growths, before the designers made the move to full-blown tentacles; {{the skin of the}} character incorporates the texture of a coffee-stained Styrofoam cup among other elements. To portray Jones on set, Bill Nighy wore a motion capture tracksuit that meant the animators at Industrial Light & Magic did not have to reshoot the scene in the studio without him or on the motion capture stage. Nighy wore make-up <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and mouth to splice into the computer-generated shots, but the images of his eyes and mouth were not used. Nighy only wore a prosthetic once, with blue-colored tentacles for when Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) steals the key to the Dead Man's Chest from under his [...] "beard" [...] as he sleeps. To create the CG version of the character, the model was closely based on a full-body scan of Nighy, with Jones reflecting his high cheekbones. Animators studied every frame of Nighy's performance: the actor himself had blessed them by making his performance more quirky than expected, providing endless fun for them. His performance also meant new controls had to be stored. Finally, Jones' tentacles are mostly a simulation, though at times they were hand-animated when they act as limbs for the character.|$|E
50|$|Eventually, {{after much}} climbing, Brittan, Shearer and Paige reach {{the river and}} {{eventually}} make {{their way out of}} the valley, exhausted and hungry but glad to be alive. After ensuring that Shearer (who had also sustained an injury from a leech <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye)</b> was in hospital, Brittan and Page arrived at the hotel only to find that nobody else had booked in.|$|R

50|$|The {{animation}} {{was produced}} by Gene Deitch. It featured four animated characters {{in front of a}} picket fence doing various activities. The animated characters were a fat kid with a beanie hat (probably meant to be Joe Cobb, a girl (probably Mary Kornman), a freckled-face boy (probably Mickey Daniels), and a dog with a ring <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> (obviously meant to be Pete the Pup).|$|R
2500|$|John Rhys-Davies as Gimli: a dwarf warrior who {{accompanies the}} Fellowship to Mordor after {{they set out}} from Rivendell and a {{descendant}} of Durin's Folk. Billy Connolly, who was considered for the part of Gimli, later portrayed Dáin II Ironfoot in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit film trilogy. Rhys-Davies wore heavy prosthetics to play Gimli, which limited his vision, and eventually developed eczema <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Tsarnaev {{returned}} to the U.S. on July 17, 2012, having grown a long, thick beard and wearing kohl <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{as a sign of}} his religious devotion to the sunnah of Islam and the example of Muhammed. His life took on an [...] "increasingly puritanical religious tone" [...] with [...] "Islamist certainty". He appeared, to some family members, to have become an [...] "extremist".|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the most}} common fantastic masks are those which depict the devils, demons and Satan himself. These vary from near normal human faces to those with wild and/or {{grotesque}} features, with human features, animal features or both. Depictions of old pre Hispanic gods remain in masks. Tlaloc was commonly depicted as having serpents <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and with the fangs of a viper. These elements {{can be found in}} devil masks today. [...] Tezcatlipoca was a night god, whose colors were black and red. These are also applied to devil masks.|$|E
60|$|And then, when Dick had clothed {{himself in}} this {{clerical}} disguise, Lawless produced some colours and a pencil, and proceeded, {{with the greatest}} cunning, to disguise his face. The eyebrows he thickened and produced; to the moustache, which was yet hardly visible, he rendered a like service; while, by a few lines <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> he changed the expression and increased the apparent age of this young monk.|$|R
60|$|They {{were in a}} vault. Dust lay everywhere, on everything, inches thick. Wood crates {{lined the}} walls, huge boxes and crates, {{packages}} and containers. Tance looked <b>around</b> curiously, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> bright.|$|R

2500|$|Following the Static Age {{sessions}} the Misfits began a {{shift in}} songwriting and appearance, with Danzig writing more songs inspired by B horror and science fiction films. He painted skeletal patterns on his performance clothing, while Only began applying dark makeup <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and styling his hair in a long point hanging from his forehead between his eyes and down to his chin, a style that became known as a [...] "devilock" [...] and which both Danzig and Only's brother Doyle would eventually adopt. This new style and musical direction would later {{be described as the}} subgenre [...] "horror punk".|$|E
2500|$|Corbucci {{originally}} {{wanted to}} cast Mark Damon (who had played {{the title character}} of Johnny Oro) as Django, but Damon experienced a conflict in his scheduling and had to withdraw. Bolognini considered either Franco Nero or Peter Martell for the role, and eventually decided to have Fulvio Frizza, the head of Euro International Film (the film's distributor), choose the actor based on photographs of the three men. Frizza chose Nero, who was reluctant {{to appear in the}} film because he wanted to perform roles in more [...] "serious" [...] films. He was eventually persuaded by his agent, Paola Petri, and her husband, director Elio Petri, to accept the role on the grounds that he would have [...] "nothing to lose". Nero was 23 when he was cast; to give the impression of an older, Clint Eastwood-type persona, he grew out his stubble, wore fake wrinkles <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and had his voice dubbed in post-production by actor Nando Gazzolo. He also asked Corbucci to have his character dressed in a black Union Army uniform as a reference to his family name (Nero means [...] "black"). During filming, Corbucci invited Sergio Leone to meet Nero, who felt that the young actor would become successful.|$|E
2500|$|After declaring {{he would}} be [...] "popping in from time to time" [...] afterwards, Sting threw the {{microphone}} down and left the ring. Days after the infamous promo, he was booked for shows in New Japan Pro Wrestling, {{to take part in}} the Japan/U.S. Superstars Tournament, where he defeated Masahiro Chono in the first round, but was eliminated in the second round by Shiro Koshinaka. His last match of 1996 took place on September 23 at the Yokohama Arena, where he and Lex Luger teamed up to defeat Arn Anderson and Steven Regal. It would end up being his last tour of Japan. On the October 21, 1996, edition of Nitro, Sting returned for the first time since the night after Fall Brawl. In a match where the impostor Sting was wrestling Mr. JL, Sting emerged wearing a trench coat and white face paint with black marks <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> He went in the ring and attacked nWo Sting (who was still imitating Sting's old mannerisms at this point) with his new finisher, the Scorpion Death Drop inverted DDT, two jumping elbow drops, a Stinger Splash and a Scorpion Deathlock while the rest of the nWo came to ringside. Rather than intervene, they simply stood by and watched. After Sting was done, Ted DiBiase and Kevin Nash came into the ring and made Sting an offer to join the nWo and get back at WCW for betraying him. Sting, after a pause, first called out the nWo Sting as a [...] "cheap imitation," [...] before telling the nWo, [...] "the real Sting may or may not be in your price range," [...] and then concluded by saying [...] "the only thing that's for sure about Sting is that nothing's for sure". [...] With that, Sting left the ring and would not speak (on mic) on WCW programming again for over a year. After this a silent, almost ghostly Sting, carrying a baseball bat as a weapon, began appearing in the rafters at WCW events and began painting his entire face with black and white corpse paint. Sting's new gimmick was inspired by the 1994 film The Crow. In retaliation, nWo Sting, who was still imitating Borden, began painting his face this way as well. While appearing on a WCW/nWo merchandise special on QVC Sports in late 1999, Borden admitted that Scott Hall had initially suggested the idea of painting his face like the character of Eric Draven from The Crow. Sting maintains aspects of his [...] "Crow" [...] persona to date, occasionally with different designs and use of color of the face paint.|$|E

60|$|He {{stares at}} his daughter, stares all <b>around</b> him, closes <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and lies slumbering on her arm.|$|R
60|$|He {{laid his}} hand firmly upon her white {{trembling}} arm. She looked <b>around,</b> following <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> Margharita, pale and proud, was standing upon the threshold, {{with a great}} bunch of white hyacinths in the bosom of her black dress.|$|R

5|$|O'Gara {{received}} his first Lions call-up {{for the tour}} to Australia in 2001. He played in four tour games, against Western Australia, NSW Waratahs, NSW Country Districts and ACT Brumbies, scoring 26 points overall. O'Gara was a substitute in the test side that played Australia A. In the game against NSW Waratahs, O'Gara was involved in an off the ball incident with Duncan McRae, which resulted in O'Gara needing eight stitches <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> and McRae being sent off and later banned for seven weeks. After the game, then Lions coach Graham Henry called the match ‘a bad day for rugby’.|$|R
5000|$|According to Rolling Stone {{journalist}} Tracy E. Hopkins, Instant Vintage {{was titled}} as a joking reference to [...] "the disposable nature of contemporary music". For the cover photo shoot, Saadiq had the makeup artist draw a circle <b>around</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> like Pete the Pup from the Our Gang comedy series. [...] "It {{was fun to}} watch people make up what it meant", Saadiq recalled. [...] "I didn't {{even know what the}} hell it meant. Later, I thought it meant that I was focused, that I had my eye on what I wanted out of my career." ...|$|R

60|$|Mr. Grex {{watched the}} young man until he had {{disappeared}} in the crowd. Then he leaned hack amongst the cushions of the divan with folded arms.

He looked like a man who was inwardly enjoying some huge joke.|$|E
60|$|John turned <b>around.</b> <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> met Lady Hilda's, and he understood. He {{handed the}} {{receiver}} to her in silence.

The lights were already lit, and cues, ready chalked, were standing by the table.|$|E
60|$|As {{he stood}} {{in the center of the}} narrow space, looking <b>around</b> him, <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> fell upon the {{upholstered}} seats ranged along one side and he regarded them suspiciously. They were box-like affairs, with the surface of the covers padded and cushioned.|$|R
