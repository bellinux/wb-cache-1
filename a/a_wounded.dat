5|$|By 1916, seventy-four {{men from}} Mells {{had left to}} fight, and several women, {{including}} Lady Horner, were working as nurses in France. By {{the end of the}} war, 21 men had been killed and multiple others wounded. Among the returned was the curate of St Andrew's Church, who earned the Military Cross for saving <b>a</b> <b>wounded</b> soldier.|$|E
5|$|During the Philippine–American War 86 {{members of}} the American {{military}} received the Medal of Honor. The only American Jew to receive it was Private Louis C. Mosher who received it for risking his life while rescuing <b>a</b> <b>wounded</b> soldier from enemy fire.|$|E
5000|$|Elizabethan collars, {{shaped like}} a {{truncated}} cone, can be fitted on a dog {{to prevent it from}} scratching <b>a</b> <b>wound</b> on its head or neck or licking <b>a</b> <b>wound</b> or infection on its body.|$|R
5000|$|This {{pathogen}} grows {{best in a}} {{warm and}} wet environment. It can infect a host without <b>a</b> <b>wound,</b> however the presence of <b>a</b> <b>wound</b> will increase infection greatly. <b>A</b> <b>wound</b> is needed for infection to occur when the tubers are in storage.

25|$|After the nasolabial flap {{has been}} emplaced, the flap donor-site wound is sutured closed. For <b>a</b> <b>wound</b> of the lateral nasal wall {{that is less}} than 15mm wide, the flap donor-site can be closed primarily, with sutures. For <b>a</b> <b>wound</b> wider than 15mm—especially <b>a</b> <b>wound</b> that comprehends the alar lobule and the lateral wall of the nose—primary closure is not indicated, because such <b>a</b> <b>wound</b> closure imposes {{excessive}} stresses upon the skin flap, thereby risking either blanching (whitening) or distortion, or both. Such risks are avoided by advancing (moving) {{the skin of the}} cheek towards the nasofacial junction, where it is sutured to the deep tissues. Furthermore, <b>a</b> narrow <b>wound,</b> less than 1mm wide can be allowed to heal by secondary intention (autonomous re-epithelialisation).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In web winding process, {{the effects}} of speed-up and speed-down on {{internal}} stresses of wound roll have been investigated. The air-entrainment can be obtained theoretically using the modified nonlinear Hakiel model. In this research work, air-entrainment model established by Hamrock and Dowson was applied to estimate the initial air film layers into <b>a</b> <b>wound</b> roll in the winding system with a nip-roller. Moreover, the characteristics of <b>a</b> <b>wound</b> roll were examined under varying tension and varying speed conditions. The numerical results showed the radial stress, tangential stress, and friction force distributions at central inside <b>a</b> <b>wound</b> roll under the condition for <b>a</b> <b>wound</b> roll without wrinkle and slippage phenomena...|$|R

5|$|After {{a day at}} Mudd's house, Booth and Herold hired a local man {{to guide}} them to Samuel Cox's house. Cox in turn took them to Thomas Jones, a Confederate sympathizer who hid Booth and Herold in Zekiah Swamp for five days until they could cross the Potomac River. On the {{afternoon}} of April 24, {{they arrived at the}} farm of Richard H. Garrett, a tobacco farmer, in King George County, Virginia. Booth told Garrett he was <b>a</b> <b>wounded</b> Confederate soldier.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest II is set {{one hundred}} years after Dragon Quest. The story begins with an attack upon Moonbrooke Castle by the wizard Hargon, who seeks to summon the demon Malroth to destroy the world. <b>A</b> <b>wounded</b> soldier escaped the battle and fled to the kingdom of Midenhall, where he informs {{the king of the}} attack before he dies. The king then {{commands}} his son, who is a descendant of Erdrick (known as Loto in Japanese translations and later localizations), to defeat Hargon.|$|E
5|$|Nausicaä and Asbel {{return to}} Pejite but find it ravaged by insects. A band of {{survivors}} reveal that they lured the creatures {{to eradicate the}} Tolmekians, and {{are doing the same}} to the Valley. They capture Nausicaä to prevent her from warning the Valley, but with the help of Asbel and his mother, Nausicaä escapes on a glider. Flying home, she finds two Pejite soldiers baiting thousands of Ohm into the Valley using <b>a</b> <b>wounded</b> baby Ohm. The Tolmekians deploy tanks and the Giant Warrior against them, but their tanks cannot stop Ohm, and the Giant Warrior, hatched prematurely, disintegrates.|$|E

5|$|On 25 September 1915 in Fauquissart, France, Rifleman Thapa, {{having been}} wounded himself, found <b>a</b> <b>wounded</b> soldier of The Leicestershire Regiment behind {{the first line}} German trench. Although urged to save himself, the Gurkha stayed with the wounded man all day and night. Early next day, in misty weather, he took him through the German wire and, leaving him {{in a place of}} {{comparative}} safety, returned and brought in two wounded Gurkhas, one after the other. He then went back, and, in broad daylight, fetched the British soldier, carrying him most of the way under enemy fire.|$|E

5|$|As Aldenham {{was making}} a turn at a {{position}} north of the islet of Škrda, to sail between islands of Planik and Olib, she hit a mine that exploded under her engine room. The ship broke in two and her bow sank quickly, followed by her stern a little later, at 15:29. Cold weather hampered rescue efforts by Atherton and accompanying motor launches ML 238 and HDML 1162, and only 58 seamen and five officers, including Farrant, were {{pulled out of the}} sea. 126 crewmen died, as well as <b>a</b> <b>wounded</b> Yugoslav Partisan transported from Pag for medical treatment and Yugoslav Partisan liaison officer, Colonel Ivan Preradović. Aldenham was the last Royal Navy destroyer lost in World War II.|$|E
5|$|During an {{engagement}} early in June 1915 Walpole single-handedly rescued <b>a</b> <b>wounded</b> soldier; his Russian comrades refused {{to help and}} Walpole carried {{one end of a}} stretcher and dragged the man to safety. For this he was awarded the Cross of Saint George; General Lechitsky presented him with the medal in August. After his tour of duty Walpole returned to Petrograd. Among the city's attractions for him was the presence of Konstantin Somov, a painter with whom he had formed a close relationship. He remained there until October 1915, when he returned to England. He visited his family, stayed with Percy Anderson in London, telephoned Henry James in Rye, and retreated to a cottage he had bought in Cornwall. In January 1916 he was asked by the Foreign Office to return to Petrograd. Russians were being subjected to highly effective German propaganda. The writer Arthur Ransome, Petrograd correspondent of The Daily News, had successfully lobbied {{for the establishment of a}} bureau to counter the German efforts, and the British ambassador, Sir George Buchanan, wanted Walpole to take charge.|$|E
5|$|Eddard says Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and the Mad King {{have been}} killed and asks why Ser Arthur was not present at the Battle of the Trident. Ser Arthur replies that he has been ordered to stay at the tower. After Eddard demands to know where his sister is, a battle ensues. Eddard is able to defeat Ser Gerold, but Ser Arthur - {{wielding}} dual swords - easily defeats most of Eddard's men by himself. As Eddard and Ser Arthur duel one-on-one, Bran is puzzled by this vision, as his father had repeatedly boasted of his defeat of Ser Arthur. It is quite apparent that his father is no match for the superior swordsman. Just as Ser Arthur is about to defeat and kill Eddard, <b>a</b> <b>wounded</b> Howland rises and plunges his dagger through the back of Ser Arthur's neck, before Eddard delivers the fatal blow, leaving Bran shocked.|$|E

5|$|Eight {{years after}} the events of Star Fox 64, Krystal looks for answers to the {{destruction}} of her home planet, Cerinia and the death of her parents. She lands on Krazoa Palace, after receiving a distress call from the planet and discovers that it was attacked by General Scales and the SharpClaw army. Krystal is persuaded by <b>a</b> <b>wounded</b> EarthWalker in the Palace to help by collecting all of the Krazoa Spirits and returning them to the palace, which would supposedly tilt the war in the dinosaurs' favour and stop Scales. However, after releasing the first one, a mysterious being sends Krystal into the spirit's path, trapping her in a floating crystal atop the Krazoa Palace until all the spirits can be returned.|$|E
5|$|He re-embarked for England in June 1916, and re-joined his {{battalion}} on the Western Front in October. Once {{back with}} his battalion, he was accidentally wounded and then gassed, and was also promoted {{to the rank of}} lance corporal. In January 1918 he was awarded the Military Medal for bravery in the field, which involved rescuing <b>a</b> <b>wounded</b> man under fire. He was then promoted to corporal. During the capture of Merris in June, he killed an eight-man German machine gun crew, saving his platoon from annihilation, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. During this action he was severely wounded. He returned to Australia to be discharged, and was employed by the South Australian Railways over many years before dying in 1953, having suffered for years with bronchitis and emphysema. He was buried with full military honours in the AIF Cemetery, West Terrace. His medal set is displayed in the Hall of Valour at the Australian War Memorial.|$|E
5|$|Lady Crane {{returns to}} her {{chambers}} to find <b>a</b> <b>wounded</b> Arya Stark hiding inside, and helps stitch her wounds. She tells Arya that thanks to her warning, she mutilated her would-be killer Bianca's face before kicking {{her out of the}} acting company. She then offers to have Arya join them, but she refuses, saying that she intends to travel west of Westeros to see the edge of the world. As Arya recovers, The Waif arrives and kills Lady Crane, intending to kill Arya as well. Arya flees through the streets of Braavos, but during the chase, Arya's wounds reopen and she limps back to her hideout with the Waif in close pursuit. As the Waif closes in, Arya uses Needle to cut a candle, plunging the room into total darkness, where, having been trained while blinded for several weeks, Arya gains the upper hand.|$|E
