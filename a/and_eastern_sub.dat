40|$|This study {{investigated}} Substance Flux Analysis (SFA) {{as a potential}} tool to obtain better estimates of phosphorus and cadmium loadings in an on-going comprehensive research effort to model the phosphorus and cadmium transport via., surface runoff to Songkhla Lake {{in the southern part}} of Thailand. The lake is a major producer for local fisheries. Because substantial portions of the drainage area are used for agriculture, non-point source pollution loading from the surrounding drainage area to the lake has become a concern, especially since surface runoff is the major transport mechanism for non-point source pollutants. Using SFA it is estimated that approximately 384, 289 t of chemical fertilizer were applied throughout the basin in 2004. The major sub-watershed contributing phosphorus and cadmium was the U-Tapao <b>and</b> <b>Eastern</b> Coast <b>Sub</b> Basin 4 Sub-watershed. Changing the fertilizers from 8 - 24 - 24, 13 - 13 - 21 and 15 - 15 - 15 (high cadmium) by 15 - 15 - 15 (low cadmium) type led to a significant decrease in cadmium contribution to the lake...|$|R

40|$|Executive Summary Since {{the fall}} of {{communist}} regimes across Central <b>and</b> <b>Eastern</b> Europe <b>and</b> the transition towards a market economy manufacturing industries in these countries have undergone an impressive reorientation towards western markets. Since the early 1990 ’s countries of the European Union {{are the most important}} trading partners and also largest investors in Central <b>and</b> <b>Eastern</b> Europe. This development has been significantly fostered by the signing of the Europe Agreements between the European Union and most of the Central <b>and</b> <b>Eastern</b> European countries in the mid nineties with the subsequent abolishment of most trade barriers and the prospect of joining the European Union. A particularly important role for economic restructuring and integration is played by multinational firms and their investment and production activities in Central <b>and</b> <b>Eastern</b> Europe. This paper aims to access the state of economic integration between the major Central <b>and</b> <b>Eastern</b> European Accession Countries and the current EU member states.
