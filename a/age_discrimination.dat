25|$|Ageism or <b>age</b> <b>{{discrimination}}</b> is {{discrimination and}} stereotyping {{based on the}} grounds of someone's age.

40|$|AbstractThe {{geometry}} and physics of three symmetric bilinear forms on the description space, which in our phenomenological calculus underlies {{the representation of}} complex systems, are discussed. These three bilinear forms represent dissipation, Lorentz metric and information, and their mathematical connections model a variety of physical and biological concepts, such as space and time, communication, causality, <b>aging,</b> <b>discrimination</b> and measurement. The phenomenological calculus of bilinear forms thus provides a unified theory of thermodynamics, relativity and quantum mechanics...|$|R

25|$|Sheldon Nahmod of Chicago-Kent College of Law shares Wells's criticism. He {{points to}} one case in {{particular}} where the Court seemed {{to recognize the}} theory that constitutional violations should always be grounds for liability regardless of whatever other issues exist. In Carey v. Phipus, decided a year after Mt. Healthy, the Court held that two students challenging their suspensions were entitled to prove that their due process rights were violated as they alleged even if the suspensions themselves {{turned out to have}} been factually justified. While not a constitutional claim, he also looks to 1995's McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Co., a case under the <b>Age</b> <b>Discrimination</b> in Employment Act, where an <b>age</b> <b>discrimination</b> verdict against a private employer was upheld even though the respondent had concededly met the Mt. Healthy burden with evidence of her wrongdoing because that evidence was discovered subsequent to the employee's termination.|$|E

The building of trust over time was vital to the production process and the actors had the time to embody their roles and the language of the play. We look at the questions “why this play,” “why all men?” and “why theatre?” and investigate the physical nature of the play and its violence a la Three Stooges or Punch and Judy. We will look at the themes of <b>aging,</b> <b>discrimination</b> and the search for family and identity, all of which have resonance today, through the lens of play...|$|R

25|$|Furthermore, the Union has legislated {{in areas}} such as extradition, family law, asylum law, and {{criminal}} justice. Prohibitions against sexual and nationality discrimination have a long standing in the treaties. In more recent years, these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race, religion, disability, age, and sexual orientation. By virtue of these powers, the EU has enacted legislation on sexual discrimination in the work-place, <b>age</b> <b>discrimination,</b> and racial discrimination.|$|E
25|$|Cultural factors, such as {{discrimination}} {{of various}} kinds, can negatively affect productivity such as <b>age</b> <b>discrimination,</b> stereotyping, discrimination against people with physical disability, gender discrimination, racial discrimination, and caste discrimination.

In addition, the fact that {{women are more likely to}} be caregivers, regardless of income level, to either the generations before or after them, exacerbates the burdens of their poverty.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of a}} {{proposed}} Equality Bill, Harman announced a consultation on changing the existing discrimination laws, including options for reverse discrimination in employment. Under the proposals, employers would be legally allowed to discriminate in favour of a job candidate {{on the basis of}} their race or gender where the candidates were otherwise equally qualified. Employers would not be required to use these powers, but would be able to do so without the threat of legal action for discriminatory practices. The white paper also proposed measures to end <b>age</b> <b>discrimination,</b> promote transparency in organisations and introduce a new equality duty on the public sector.|$|E

Company 2713-V arrived at the Garrison Camp in July 1939. The company had been established in August 1934 and spent its first two years developing Camden State Park in southwest Minnesota, then three years completing Fort Ridgely State Park in the south-central part of the state. Individual enrollees, however, only served for about nine months. While the regular companies of the CCC were for men {{under the age of}} 25, the Veterans Division was established to accept older men—veterans of World War I who had been particularly hard hit by unemployment during the Great Depression, due in part to <b>age</b> <b>discrimination</b> and high incidences of post-war physical and mental disabilities.|$|E

40|$|Several {{concurrent}} hypotheses {{have been}} proposed {{in order to take}} into account the persistence of under-employment of persons aged over 50, in France. In this paper, we are interested in the labour demand. We construct and implement an experimental protocol allowing testing four hypothesescurrently discussed: the unobservable distance from retirement by the recruiter; the supposed depreciation of skills in a context with repeated technological shocks; the supposed inability of professional retraining, eventually differentiated by gender; a taste discrimination against older workers, as the result of social norms. To test each of these hypotheses, we have conducted four separate campaigns of testing for evaluating them. Between mid-January and mid-August 2015, we have sent, 6 361 applications allocated on seven occupations and twenty-eight profiles. The research investigates a statistical processing of results of these testings. Our results indicate which must necessarily combine several hypotheses {{to take into account the}} under-employment of seniors, in France: the difficulties of professional retraining following a shock in the employment career; the social norms inducing a negative representation of the older workers through the employers. Seniors are both victims of the depreciation of the human capital and <b>age</b> <b>discriminations</b> in access to employment, which will especially penalise men in their professional retraining. The classicalexplanation by the distance from retirement is the only one which isn’t statistical validated...|$|R

In Europe, Stijn Baert, Jennifer Norga, Yannick Thuy and Marieke Van Hecke, researchers at Ghent University, measured comparable ratio's in Belgium. Interestingly, they found that <b>age</b> <b>discrimination</b> is heterogeneous by the activity older candidates undertook during their additional post-educational years. In Belgium, they are only discriminated if they have more years of inactivity or irrelevant employment.|$|E
30|$|If a {{water flow}} is applied and shear forces are present, cyprids {{actively}} respond by altering their exploration behavior [103]. On hydrophilic surfaces, the step length remains unchanged, but the step duration increases. In contrast, larger step lengths and shorter step durations are observed on hydrophobic surfaces. Especially the shorter steps can {{be connected with}} the requirement to re-generate surface contacts more frequently as the temporary anchoring point is challenged {{by the presence of}} shear.
