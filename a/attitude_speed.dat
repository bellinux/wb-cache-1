40|$|Abstract—Since the 1980 s, {{engineers}} {{tried to}} utilize intelligent transportation systems, ITS, as appropriate {{solutions to the}} basic problems of traffic management. ITS have been relied on to upgrade the safety level of transportation systems, {{to reduce the number}} and severity of accidents, and to improve the effectiveness of transportation methods. However, wide-spread implementation and deployment of these systems need to be behaviorally justified as well. Towards that goal, ITS must be integrated so as to model these systems for proper evaluation. This research is the study of the application of intelligent transportation systems in improving safety and driver behavior. A case study of the Tehran-Saveh Highway involving the deployment of ITS using speed control cameras for improving safety and the reduction of accidents was examined.

40|$|This article describes. the {{development}} and validation of a self-report questionnaire to measure the determinants of speeding behaviour in road traffic, based on the theory of planned behaviour. A provisional questionnaire measuring self-reported speeding behaviour {{as well as its}} determinants as predicted by the TPB model (<b>attitudes</b> towards <b>speeding</b> and towards respecting speed limits, social norms, perceived behavioural control, and intentions) was completed by 116 drivers. Separate principal component analyses on the items measuring attitudes, social norms and perceived control resulted in two component solutions, explaining between 46. 5 % and 57. 5 % of the variance, for each determinant. After Promax rotation, these solutions were used to construct eight scales comprising 2 - 7 items each, measuring negative and positive <b>attitude</b> towards <b>speeding,</b> negative and positive <b>attitude</b> towards respecting <b>speed</b> limits, explicit and implicit social norm, and perceived internal and external control, respectively. Internal consistencies ranged from. 51 to. 82. Scale scores accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in intention and self-reported behaviour. Intentions were most strongly predicted by explicit social norms and negative <b>attitude</b> towards respecting <b>speed</b> limits. Self-reported speeding was predicted by intention and perceived internal control. In contrast, actual speeding behaviour was not significantly predicted by intentions and perceived control. The study demonstrates the validity of the theory of planned behaviour to predict self-reported speeding behaviour and provides a valid and reliable measure of the cognitive concepts featured in this model, but suggests that actual speeding behaviour can only partially be predicted from these concepts.

The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) {{has been used}} to identify individuals who are likely to engage in behaviours, such as speeding, which are associated with increased accident involvement. In an attempt to investigate adolescents‟ attitudes and behaviours from pre- to post-driver training, the studies presented incorporate past behaviour into the TPB. Three questionnaire-based studies were conducted in Scotland and New Zealand. The first study explored adolescent pre-drivers‟ road behaviour, driving <b>attitudes</b> and <b>speeding</b> intentions.

40|$|The {{positive}} relationship between speed and crash risk and severity is robust and well-established. While excessive speeding is typically regarded by the public as a common contributing factor in road crashes, speeding remains a common traffic infringement and an arguably socially acceptable behaviour, particularly at low levels over the speed limit. This suggests that other factors potentially contribute to this disparity between crash perceptions and actual behaviours. Previous work has described associations between perceptions of the legitimacy of <b>speed</b> enforcement, <b>attitudes,</b> and how {{they relate to the}} likelihood of speeding. This study sought to more closely examine the nature of the relationships between these variables. In total, 293 Queensland drivers participated in a study that examined how demographics, personality variables, attitudes, and perceptions of the legitimacy of enforcement contributed to drivers’ self-reported likelihood of speeding. Results suggested that positive <b>attitudes</b> towards <b>speeding</b> had the greatest impact on likelihood of speeding behaviours. Being younger and higher levels of the personality trait of extraversion were also associated with greater levels of self-reported likelihood of <b>speeding.</b> <b>Attitudes</b> were found to mediate the relationship between perceived legitimacy of speed enforcement and self-reported likelihood of speeding. A subgroup analysis of participants with positive and negative <b>attitudes</b> towards <b>speeding</b> revealed that a differential set of variables were predictive of self-reported likelihood of speeding for the two subgroups. This highlights the potential importance of attitudes in understanding the influence of perceptions of legitimacy of speed enforcement on speeding behaviour, and the need for targeted rather than a ‘one size fits all’ approach to changing attitudes and ultimately behaviour.

40|$|Exceeding {{the speed}} limit and driving too fast for the {{conditions}} are regularly cited as significant contributing factors in traffic crashes, particularly fatal and serious injury crashes. Despite an extensive body of research highlighting the relationship between increased vehicle speeds and crash risk and severity, speeding remains a pervasive behaviour on Australian roads. The development of effective countermeasures designed to reduce the prevalence of speeding behaviour requires that this behaviour is well understood. The primary aim of this program of research {{was to develop a}} better understanding of the influence of drivers’ perceptions and <b>attitudes</b> toward police <b>speed</b> enforcement on speeding behaviour. Study 1 employed focus group discussions with 39 licensed drivers to explore the influence of perceptions relating to specific characteristics of speed enforcement policies and practices on drivers’ <b>attitudes</b> towards <b>speed</b> enforcement. Three primary factors were identified as being most influential: site selection; visibility; and automaticity (i. e., whether the enforcement approach is automated/camera-based or manually operated). Perceptions regarding these enforcement characteristics were found to influence attitudes regarding the perceived legitimacy and transparency of speed enforcement. Moreover, misperceptions regarding speed enforcement policies and practices appeared to also have a substantial impact on <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>speed</b> enforcement, typically in a negative direction. These findings have important implications for road safety given that prior research has suggested that the effectiveness of speed enforcement approaches may be reduced if efforts are perceived by drivers as being illegitimate, such that they do little to encourage voluntary compliance. Study 1 also examined the impact of speed enforcement approaches varying in the degree of visibility and automaticity on self-reported willingness to comply with speed limits. These discussions suggested that all of the examined speed enforcement approaches (see Section 1. 5 for more details) generally showed potential to reduce vehicle speeds and encourage compliance with posted speed limits. Nonetheless, participant responses suggested a greater willingness to comply with approaches operated in a highly visible manner, irrespective of the corresponding level of automaticity of the approach. While less visible approaches were typically associated with poorer rates of driver acceptance (e. g., perceived as “sneaky” and “unfair”), participants reported that such approaches would likely encourage long-term and network-wide impacts on their own speeding behaviour, as a function of the increased unpredictability of operations and increased direct (specific deterrence) and vicarious (general deterrence) experiences with punishment. Participants in Study 1 suggested that automated approaches, particularly when operated in a highly visible manner, do little to encourage compliance with speed limits except in the immediate vicinity of the enforcement location. While speed cameras have been criticised on such grounds in the past, such approaches can still have substantial road safety benefits if implemented in high-risk settings. Moreover, site-learning effects associated with automated approaches can also be argued to be a beneficial by-product of enforcement, such that behavioural modifications are achieved even in the absence of actual enforcement. Conversely, manually operated approaches were reported to be associated with more network-wide impacts on behaviour. In addition, the reported acceptance of such methods was high, due to the increased swiftness of punishment, ability for additional illegal driving behaviours to be policed and the salutary influence associated with increased face-to-face contact with authority. Study 2 involved a quantitative survey conducted with 718 licensed Queensland drivers from metropolitan and regional areas. The survey sought to further examine the influence of the visibility and automaticity of operations on self-reported likelihood and duration of compliance. Overall, the results from Study 2 corroborated those of Study 1. All examined approaches were again found to encourage compliance with speed limits, such that all approaches could be considered to be “effective”. Nonetheless, significantly greater self-reported likelihood and duration of compliance was associated with visibly operated approaches, irrespective of the corresponding automaticity of the approach. In addition, the impact of automaticity was influenced by visibility; such that significantly greater self-reported likelihood of compliance was associated with manually operated approaches, but only when they are operated in a less visible fashion. Conversely, manually operated approaches were associated with significantly greater durations of self-reported compliance, but only when they are operated in a highly visible manner. Taken together, the findings from Studies 1 and 2 suggest that enforcement efforts, irrespective of their visibility or automaticity, generally encourage compliance with speed limits. However, the duration of these effects on behaviour upon removal of the enforcement efforts remains questionable and represents an area where current speed enforcement practices could possibly be improved. Overall, it appears that identifying the optimal mix of enforcement operations, implementing them at a sufficient intensity and increasing the unpredictability of enforcement efforts (e. g., greater use of less visible approaches, random scheduling) are critical elements of success. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were also performed in Study 2 to investigate the punishment-related and attitudinal constructs that influence self-reported frequency of speeding behaviour. The research was based on the theoretical framework of expanded deterrence theory, augmented with three particular attitudinal constructs. Specifically, previous research examining the influence of <b>attitudes</b> on <b>speeding</b> behaviour has typically focussed on <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>speeding</b> behaviour in general only. This research sought to more comprehensively explore the influence of attitudes by also individually measuring and analysing <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>speed</b> enforcement and <b>attitudes</b> toward the appropriateness of speed limits on speeding behaviour. Consistent with previous research, a number of classical and expanded deterrence theory variables were found to significantly predict self-reported frequency of speeding behaviour. Significantly greater speeding behaviour was typically reported by those participants who perceived punishment associated with speeding to be less certain, who reported more frequent use of punishment avoidance strategies and who reported greater direct experiences with punishment. A number of interesting differences in the significant predictors among males and females, as well as younger and older drivers, were reported. Specifically, classical deterrence theory variables appeared most influential on the speeding behaviour of males and younger drivers, while expanded deterrence theory constructs appeared more influential for females. These findings have important implications for the development and implementation of speeding countermeasures. Of the attitudinal factors, significantly greater self-reported frequency of speeding behaviour was reported among participants who held more favourable <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>speeding</b> and who perceived speed limits to be set inappropriately low. Disappointingly, <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>speed</b> enforcement were found to have little influence on reported speeding behaviour, over and above the other deterrence theory and attitudinal constructs. Indeed, the relationship between <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>speed</b> enforcement and self-reported speeding behaviour was completely accounted for by <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>speeding.</b> Nonetheless, the complexity of <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>speed</b> enforcement are not yet fully understood and future research should more comprehensively explore the measurement of this construct. Finally, given the wealth of evidence (both in general and emerging from this program of research) highlighting the association between punishment avoidance and speeding behaviour, Study 2 also sought to investigate the factors that influence the self-reported propensity to use punishment avoidance strategies. A standard multiple regression analysis was conducted for exploratory purposes only. The results revealed that punishment-related and attitudinal factors significantly predicted approximately one fifth of the variance in the dependent variable. The perceived ability to avoid punishment, vicarious punishment experience, vicarious punishment avoidance and <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>speeding</b> were all significant predictors. Future research should examine these relationships more thoroughly and identify additional influential factors. In summary, the current program of research has a number of implications for road safety and speed enforcement policy and practice decision-making. The research highlights a number of potential avenues for the improvement of public education regarding enforcement efforts and provides a number of insights into punishment avoidance behaviours. In addition, the research adds strength to the argument that enforcement approaches should not only demonstrate effectiveness in achieving key road safety objectives, such as reduced vehicle speeds and associated crashes, but also strive to be transparent and legitimate, such that voluntary compliance is encouraged. A number of potential strategies are discussed (e. g., point-to-point speed cameras, intelligent speed adaptation. The correct mix and intensity of enforcement approaches appears critical for achieving optimum effectiveness from enforcement efforts, as well as enhancements in the unpredictability of operations and swiftness of punishment. Achievement of these goals should increase both the general and specific deterrent effects associated with enforcement through an increased perceived risk of detection and a more balanced exposure to punishment and punishment avoidance experiences...|$|R
40|$|It is {{hypothesized}} {{that in a}} given situation speeding behaviour is determined by three subjective speed assessments: the speed perceived as the riskiest, the speed perceived as the safest, and the speed perceived as the most pleasurable. Specifically, if these assessments are high, drivers are expected to circulate faster.

Data analyses (ANOVA and path analyses) confirmed the influence of the three types of speed assessment on the usual speed and that the influence of attitudes on this behaviour is mediated by these three assessments.

From {{the results of the}} investigation, it was concluded that the airplane should be ditched at the lowest <b>speed</b> and highest <b>attitude</b> consistent with adequate control (near 22 deg) with landing gear retracted. In a calm-water ditching under these conditions the airplane will probably nose in slightly, then make a fairly smooth run. The fuselage bottom will sustain appreciable damage so that rapid flooding and short flotation time are likely. Maximum longitudinal deceleration will be about 4 g and maximum normal acceleration will be about 6 g in a landing run of about 420 feet, In a calm-water ditching under similar conditions with the landing gear extended, the airplane will probably dive. Maximum longitudinal decelerations will be about 5 - 1 / 2 g and maximum normal accelerations will be about 3 - 1 / 2 g in a landing run of about 170 feet...|$|R
30|$|We {{collected}} subjective data {{on driving}} behaviors using an on-line survey. The survey questions covered driving patterns, <b>attitudes</b> about <b>speeding</b> in various contexts, risk perceptions accompanying each context, risk-taking during driving (measured {{on a scale}} of 1 to 7, with 1 being “no chance” and 7 “a high chance”), the frequency of near-accident events, and the perceived effectiveness of rewards versus fines. In addition, we collected data on socio-demographic characteristics to assess their association with self-reported driving patterns. We allocated each participant a unique identifier, allowing us to track his or her performance throughout the research.|$|R
40|$|Decentralized {{flight control}} shows great {{advantage}} in implemen-tation, and is well fitted into a systematic flight control systems development and engineering process. However, {{the preservation of}} locally achieved design specifications under the integrated system environment is largely unknown. This work proposes two control integration approaches to address this challenge. It describes both open-loop and closed-loop integration strategies within an integrated control framework. Furthermore, the selection of candidate subsys-tems is also taken into account during integration. Using an inte-grated longitudinal pitch <b>attitude</b> and <b>speed</b> control example, the performance of both strategies is evaluated. Numerical simulation results are included for further demonstration...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a control design for tracking of <b>attitude</b> and <b>speed</b> of an underactuated slender-hull unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV). The control design {{is based on}} Port-Hamiltonian theory. The target dynamics (desired dynamic response) is shaped with {{particular attention to the}} target mass matrix so that the influence of the unactuated dynamics on the controlled system is suppressed. This results in achievable dynamics independent of uncontrolled states. Throughout the design, insight of the physical phenomena involved is used to propose the desired target dynamics. The performance of the design is demonstrated through simulation with a high-fidelity model...|$|R
30|$|The {{impact of}} drivers’ {{enjoyment}} of driving fast on drivers’ <b>attitude</b> towards exceeding <b>speed</b> limits was found significant only on motorways, as {{this type of}} network is the most appropriate for higher speeds. This finding {{may lead to the}} conclusion that, in all other types of road networks, drivers do not exceed speed limits for their pleasure.|$|R
