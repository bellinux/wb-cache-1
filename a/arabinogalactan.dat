25|$|Carbohydrates make {{up about}} 50% of the dry weight of green coffee beans. The {{carbohydrate}} fraction of green coffee is dominated by polysaccharides, such as <b>arabinogalactan,</b> galactomannan, and cellulose, contributing to the tasteless flavor of green coffee. <b>Arabinogalactan</b> makes up to 17% of dry weight of green coffee beans, with a molecular weight of 90 kDa to 200 kDa. It is composed of beta-1-3-linked galactan main chains, with frequent members of arabinose (pentose) and galactose (hexose) residues at the side chains comprising immunomodulating properties by stimulating the cellular defense system (Th-1 response) of the body. Mature brown to yellow coffee beans contain fewer residues of galactose and arabinose at the side chain of the polysaccharides, making the green coffee bean more resistant to physical breakdown and less soluble in water. The molecular weight of the <b>arabinogalactan</b> in coffee is higher than in most other plants, improving the cellular defense system of the digestive tract compared to <b>arabinogalactan</b> with lower molecular weight. Free monosaccharides are present in mature brown to yellow-green coffee beans. The free part of monosaccharides contains sucrose (gluco-fructose) up to 9000mg/100g of arabica green coffee bean, a lower amount in robustas, i.e. 4500mg/100g. In arabica green coffee beans, the content of free glucose was 30 to 38mg/100g, free fructose 23 to 30mg/100g; free galactose 35mg/100g and mannitol 50mg/100g dried coffee beans, respectively. Mannitol is a powerful scavenger for hydroxyl radicals, which are generated during the peroxidation of lipids in biological membranes.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{structural}} proteins (1-5%) {{are found}} in most plant cell walls; they are classified as hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGP), <b>arabinogalactan</b> proteins (AGP), glycine-rich proteins (GRPs), and proline-rich proteins (PRPs). Each class of glycoprotein is defined by a characteristic, highly repetitive protein sequence. Most are glycosylated, contain hydroxyproline (Hyp) and become cross-linked in the cell wall. These proteins are often concentrated in specialized cells and in cell corners. Cell walls of the epidermis may contain cutin. The Casparian strip in the endodermis roots and cork cells of plant bark contain suberin. Both cutin and suberin are polyesters that function as permeability barriers to the movement of water. The relative composition of carbohydrates, secondary compounds and proteins varies between plants and between the cell type and age. Plant cells walls also contain numerous enzymes, such as hydrolases, esterases, peroxidases, and transglycosylases, that cut, trim and cross-link wall polymers.|$|E

40|$|Legumes, most {{commonly}} identified as beans or lentils, {{provide a good}} source of both protein and carbohydrates. Many legumes contain the polysaccharide <b>arabinogalactans,</b> classified as dietary fiber and have unique functional properties in foods. However, these, and other plant polysaccharides have not been well characterized. A preliminary collaborative study between Florida State University and the Whistler Center at Purdue indicated that isolated legume <b>arabinogalactans</b> appear to have high texturizing capability through formation of viscoelastic structures. Their soluble property may also present unique fiber nutritional trait. These properties of <b>arabinogalactans</b> and their variability among different legumes are yet to be analyzed. In this study the carbohydrate composition of the 24 most common legumes were analyzed. Gas chromatography (GC) is routinely used to determine the carbohydrate, or monosaccharide, composition by hydrolyzing and converting sugars into volatile derivatives. Results from the experiment revealed that the legumes varied in their abundance of both arabinose and galactose. Legumes with higher relative abundance of these polysaccharides have higher dietary fiber content. These results provide a better understanding of carbohydrate composition of legumes including <b>arabinogalactans.</b> In the remainder of the project, variability in polysaccharide contents and ratios of arabinose/galactose will be assessed to obtain a comprehensive picture of the structural differences among the <b>arabinogalactans</b> of the 20 legume varieties.

40|$|Coffee beans (arabica) with {{different}} degrees of roast were sequentially extracted with water (90 °C, 1 h), water (170 °C, 30 min), and 0. 05 M NaOH (0 °C, 1 h). The amount and composition of polysaccharides, oligosaccharides and monosaccharides in the extracts and residues were analyzed. The results were compared with {{the composition of the}} same batch of green arabica coffee beans. Although part of our results were already reported in rather fragmented studies, this study gives a more complete overview of the amount and composition of unextractable polymers, extractable polymers, oligomers, monomers, and their conversion into (non-sugar) degradation products as a function of their degree of roast. It was found that most carbohydrates in the roasted coffee bean were present as polysaccharides (extractable or unextractable). The fact that {{only a small part of}} the carbohydrates in the extracts were recovered as oligomer and even less as monomers, showed that oligomers and especially monomers were converted very rapidly into Maillard and pyrolysis products. Cellulose remains unextractable and its solubility was not affected by the degree of roast. Galactomannans were also mainly present as unextractable polymers in green beans, but were solubilized to a large extent with increasing degrees of roast. The <b>arabinogalactans</b> in the roasted bean were highly soluble at the extraction conditions used. The arabinose as present as side-chains in the <b>arabinogalactans</b> were found to be more susceptible to degradation at more severe roasting conditions than the galactans.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{large body}} of {{literature}} suggests that certain polysaccharides affect immune system function. Much of this literature, however, consists of in vitro studies or studies in which polysaccharides were injected. Their immunologic effects following oral administration is less clear. The purpose of this systematic review was to consolidate and evaluate the available data regarding the specific immunologic effects of dietary polysaccharides. Methods Studies were identified by conducting PubMed and Google Scholar electronic searches and through reviews of polysaccharide article bibliographies. Only articles published in English were included in this review. Two researchers reviewed data on study design, control, sample size, results, and nature of outcome measures. Subsequent searches were conducted to gather information about polysaccharide safety, structure and composition, and disposition. Results We found 62 publications reporting statistically significant effects of orally ingested glucans, pectins, heteroglycans, glucomannans, fucoidans, galactomannans, <b>arabinogalactans</b> and mixed polysaccharide products in rodents. Fifteen controlled human studies reported that oral glucans, <b>arabinogalactans,</b> heteroglycans, and fucoidans exerted significant effects. Although some studies investigated anti-inflammatory effects, most studies investigated the ability of oral polysaccharides to stimulate the immune system. These studies, as well as safety and toxicity studies, suggest that these polysaccharide products appear to be largely well-tolerated. Conclusions Taken as a whole, the oral polysaccharide literature is highly heterogenous and {{is not sufficient to}} support broad product structure/function generalizations. Numerous dietary polysaccharides, particularly glucans, appear to elicit diverse immunomodulatory effects in numerous animal tissues, including the blood, GI tract and spleen. Glucan extracts from the Trametes versicolor mushroom improved survival and immune function in human RCTs of cancer patients; glucans, <b>arabinogalactans</b> and fucoidans elicited immunomodulatory effects in controlled studies of healthy adults and patients with canker sores and seasonal allergies. This review provides a foundation that can serve to guide future research on immune modulation by well-characterized polysaccharide compounds. </p...|$|R

Almost all of the galactomannans eluted in two neutral populations, while {{almost all of the}} <b>arabinogalactans</b> bound to the column, indicating that these <b>arabinogalactans</b> contain charged groups. Analysis of the molecular weight distribution of the two neutral populations showed that they differ in their molecular weight. Further characterization of these neutral populations by NMR and by MALDI-TOF MS after enzymatic degradation with an endo-mannanase, showed the presence of acetyl groups linked to the galactomannans, a feature not previously described for this type of polysaccharides from coffee beans. It was found that the high molecular weight (ca. 2000 kDa) neutral fraction was highly substituted both with galactose residues and acetyl groups, while the low molecular weight (ca. 20 kDa) population was much less substituted. Based on these results it can be concluded that at least two distinctly different populations of galactomannans are present in green coffee beans.
