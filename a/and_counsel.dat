The survey design, which was mainly quantitative in nature, was used. Self-administered questionnaires were used to collect data. Three hundred inclusive primary school administrators and three hundred school counsellors participated in the study. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 11. 0 was used to analyze data. Frequency tables, ratios and Chi-square tests were computed. The study revealed that Zimbabwean inclusive primary school counsellors lacked training in School Guidance <b>and</b> <b>Counselling</b> <b>and</b> Special Needs Education. The school counsellors also lacked experience in teaching children with disabilities and the stakeholders had negative attitudes towards School Guidance <b>and</b> <b>Counselling</b> services provisions for children with disabilities. It was further revealed that inclusive primary schools lacked materials and supplies, time, finance, physical and curricular resources. The study revealed that there was no mandatory School Guidance <b>and</b> <b>Counselling</b> policy <b>and</b> legislation, clear mission statement, School Guidance <b>and</b> <b>Counselling</b> Framework, school counsellor certification requirements nor a School Guidance <b>and</b> <b>Counselling</b> national model. These facilities, together with Special Needs Education, experience in teaching children with disabilities and staff development, were found to positively impact on SGC services provisions for children with disabilities. School counsellors’ training in School Guidance <b>and</b> <b>Counselling,</b> advocacy on disabilities, stakeholders’ collaboration, passing mandatory School Guidance <b>and</b> <b>Counselling</b> policy <b>and</b> legislation, adequate budgetary and time allocation were seen as strategies to overcome challenges in SGC services provisions for children with disabilities in Zimbabwean inclusive primary schools. It was recommended that School Guidance <b>and</b> <b>Counselling</b> services provisions for children with disabilities in Zimbabwean inclusive primary schools would improve if there would be promulgation of mandatory School Guidance <b>and</b> <b>Counselling</b> policy <b>and</b> legislation, school counsellors’ training in School Guidance <b>and</b> <b>Counselling,</b> requisition of adequate resources and development of positive attitudes among stakeholders.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{attempted}} {{to assess the}} effectiveness of the Zimbabwean secondary school guidance <b>and</b> <b>counselling</b> services from school counsellors' and students' perspective. Available literature shows that students worldwide, including Zimbabwe, experience problems which schools should solve through the provision of guidance <b>and</b> <b>counselling.</b> It was therefore, important to the researcher to assess {{the effectiveness of the}} school guidance <b>and</b> <b>counselling</b> services in meeting students' concerns. The research design consisted of a literature and an empirical study. The survey method was used in the empirical study. A self constructed questionnaire was used. Three hundred and fourteen school counsellors and 636 students participated in this study. The SAS/STAT version 9. 1 was used to analyse the data. One way and combined two way frequency tables were calculated. Ratios were calculated to establish the relative rating of each item. Chi-square tests were also calculated. The study revealed that there were differences between the level of the school guidance <b>and</b> <b>counselling</b> services in Zimbabwean secondary schools and the international arena. For example, school guidance <b>and</b> <b>counselling</b> services policy in Zimbabwe was not mandatory as compared to the international policies. The Zimbabwean school guidance <b>and</b> <b>counselling</b> services were not always planned for {{at the beginning of each}} year, Students and parents were not frequently involved in needs assessment while the services were not frequently evaluated in comparison with those in the international arena. The study also revealed that some biographical variables significantly influenced the way the respondents responded to given items while others did not. The study revealed that the majority of both school counsellors and students viewed the school guidance <b>and</b> <b>counselling</b> services as beneficial and school counsellors as effectively playing their role. The study further revealed that the effectiveness of the Zimbabwean secondary school guidance <b>and</b> <b>counselling</b> services was negatively affected by lack of resources and training in guidance <b>and</b> <b>counselling</b> <b>and</b> non-counselling duties performed by school counsellors.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of Durban-Westville, 2003. The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the perceptions of school counselors or guidance educators and students about the need for Guidance <b>and</b> <b>Counselling</b> in schools. Changes in the political arena and the birth of the new dispensation brought about changes in education and service delivery. The doors of education were opened to allow even the poorest of the poor to access equal opportunities. Apartheid education had disempowered black people to the advantage of whites. For the first time in the history of our education everyone enjoyed equal access and opportunities. Our classrooms became places where young people, black and white, can now access the best education for them to succeed in life, and fulfill ambitions that not so long ago seemed so remote. The study focuses on the availability of psychological services in ten high schools in the greater Durban North region. Questionnaires were administered to School Counsellors, Guidance educators and students in schools where school Guidance <b>and</b> <b>Counselling</b> is offered <b>and</b> to those in schools where it is not offered. It was hypothesized that Guidance <b>and</b> <b>Counselling</b> was not effectively and adequately offered in high schools. The results of the study indicate that both educators and students feel that there is the need to either revive or improve guidance <b>and</b> <b>counselling</b> services. Statistical analysis indicated that the majority of African schools that participated in the study do not offer Guidance <b>and</b> <b>Counselling,</b> with the lack of resources as the main cause. Retrenchments and the granting of voluntary severance packages were cited as some of the factors affecting the delivery of quality guidance <b>and</b> <b>counselling.</b> Schools are unique and problems and challenges facing them differ from one area to another, yet there is a dire need to improve the Guidance <b>and</b> <b>Counselling</b> services that are generally inadequate. It is hoped that the study will, firstly, stimulate further research in education support services, specifically Guidance <b>and</b> <b>Counselling</b> as a school subject, and, secondly, the findings will evoke debates about guidance <b>and</b> <b>counselling</b> services in schools...|$|R
