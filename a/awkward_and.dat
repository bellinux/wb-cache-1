5|$|The humorous 2007 {{animated}} film Bee Movie used Jerry Seinfeld's first script and {{was his first}} work for children; he starred as a bee named Barry B. Benson, alongside Renée Zellweger. Critics found its premise <b>awkward</b> <b>and</b> its delivery tame.|$|E
5|$|While {{the quality}} of the game's {{graphics}} was lauded and sales were good during its month of release, the control was received negatively by critics, who felt it was <b>awkward</b> <b>and</b> unintuitive. Nevertheless, the game spawned two sequels, released in 2001 and 2003.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} reinforced Drake's {{decision to}} retreat from live appearances; the few concerts he did play around this time were usually brief, <b>awkward,</b> <b>and</b> poorly attended. Drake seemed reluctant to perform and rarely addressed his audience. As many of his songs were played in different tunings, he frequently paused to retune between numbers.|$|E

5|$|After {{doing some}} more searching, Veronica discovers {{that one of}} the lab members {{actually}} stole the monkey after developing a special bond with it. The lab member knew he could blame it on PHAT. Veronica decides to tell the other lab members that she was unable to find the monkey, although she is surprised to learn that they will quickly get another monkey. Veronica has a heartfelt conversation with Piz, although soon afterward, she goes back to Logan. Keith decides to take the case of Dean O’Dell’s death. The next morning, Piz walks up to Veronica excitedly, but Logan appears, making things <b>awkward</b> <b>and</b> causing Piz to leave sadly.|$|E
5|$|Following Ruland's {{departure}} in 1863, the Queen {{looked for}} a husband for Helena. However, as a middle child, {{the prospect of a}} powerful alliance with a European royal house was low. Her appearance was also a concern, as by the age of fifteen she was described by her biographer as chunky, dowdy and double-chinned. Furthermore, Victoria insisted that Helena's future husband had to be prepared to live near the Queen, thus keeping her daughter nearby. Her choice eventually fell on Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein; however, the match was politically <b>awkward,</b> <b>and</b> caused a severe breach within the royal family.|$|E
5|$|On December 8, 1980, Mark David Chapman {{shocked the}} world by murdering 40-year-old {{musician}} and activist, John Lennon, outside The Dakota, his New York apartment building. Chapman's motives were fabricated from pure delusion, fueled by an obsession with the fictional character Holden Caulfield and his similar misadventures in J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. In one instant, an anonymous, socially <b>awkward</b> <b>and</b> mentally unstable 25-year-old fan of The Beatles, who had fluctuated between idealizing Lennon and being overcome {{with a desire to}} kill him, altered the course of the history of music.|$|E

5|$|Pam apologizes to Jim that Roy {{attacked}} him but her assurance that {{her relationship with}} Roy is over for good is met with polite skepticism. Roy picks up his last paycheck, apologizes to Jim for threatening him during their previous encounter, and asks Pam to join him for coffee. Their meeting at a local diner is <b>awkward</b> <b>and</b> ends with their relationship (and even friendship) appearing to be over; they hug and Pam wipes a tear from her face. Roy encourages Pam to pursue her feelings for Jim {{but she says she}} will not try to get him. Roy does not understand his long-time fiancée, especially her choice to not pursue Jim.|$|E
5|$|The M249 LMG entered {{service in}} 1984 as the M249 SAW. Initial {{reactions}} to the gun were mixed: it fulfilled the light machine gun role well when fired from the ground, but was not as effective when fired from the shoulder or hip. It was praised for its extreme durability and massive firepower, though {{a number of areas}} for improvement were highlighted: the blank firing attachment fitted poorly, the bipod was very weak and broke easily, the sling attachment was <b>awkward,</b> <b>and</b> there were many slots and gaps that accumulated dirt. Some claimed that the heavy-barrelled version of the M16 rifle was a more effective light machine gun.|$|E
5|$|When Lieutenant General Krueger's Sixth United States Army {{headquarters}} {{arrived in}} Australia in February 1943, the administrative functions {{were taken from}} USASOS and given to a new headquarters, United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE), under MacArthur's command. This had the same name as MacArthur's old headquarters in the Philippines, but its function was different. This left USASOS with logistical responsibilities only. The new arrangement was <b>awkward,</b> <b>and</b> required considerable adjustment before it functioned properly. In September 1943, Marshall was replaced by Brigadier General James L. Frink.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{were divided}} in their {{opinions}} of the Escape sections. Edge and Wallace thought that the Escape sections were satisfying to solve, while Robinson did not find them fun. Boosinger called them dull and uninspired, but appreciated their connections to the game's mathematical and scientific themes. Several reviewers noted that the controls for both the Nintendo 3DS and the PlayStation Vita were <b>awkward</b> <b>and</b> oversensitive, and Molie L. Patterson of Electronic Gaming Monthly found the limited camera movement disappointing as well. Kemps commented that the user interface was improved from Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors. Many reviewers praised the flowchart for not forcing the player to replay previously completed sections or restart the game from the beginning, but Boosinger and Edge criticized it for removing the tension of making wrong decisions.|$|E
5|$|The grandsons are {{depicted}} {{in very different}} styles: Alessandro acts in a formal manner and wears clothes of similar colour and tones to Paul. Ottavio, by contrast, wears the browns of the upper right-hand passage, {{an area of the}} painting that cuts him physically from the pope. His pose is <b>awkward</b> <b>and</b> difficult to interpret, but he is rendered in a more naturalistic manner than his brother. Alessandro has a distracted, brooding expression. He holds the knob of Paul's backrest, in an echo of Raphael's portrait where Clement VII holds the chair of Leo X as an indicator of his ambitions of succession. Thus Alessandro seems better placed politically, standing to Paul's right in a pose that recalls traditional depictions of Paul the Apostle, and his hand is raised as if in blessing. In the end, Paul was unable to influence his succession after Charles V weakened the Medici hold on the office.|$|E
5|$|Fatboy and Poppy's {{relationship}} turns sour when Poppy {{suggests that}} they should buy a house together. Fatboy eventually pulls himself together and tells her that they haven't been together long enough yet. She then ends their relationship and Fatboy moves in with Tamwar. Fatboy later suggests to Poppy that they rent a flat to begin with and take it from there. The couple reunite with a romantic kiss. However, when Denise feels uncomfortable with the way her new fiancée Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) is currently treating her, she gets comfort from Fatboy and the pair are unable to resist each other. When Poppy finds out that they shared a kiss, they realise {{that they are not}} right for each other and Poppy returns to go and live with her mum. Upset by the couple's break-up, Fatboy gently tells Dot that her and Poppy are still friends. He supports Dot when he learns that her son Nick Cotton (John Altman) dies and is surprised by the arrival of her estranged grandson, Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett). When Fatboy is told that he is no longer needed at The Queen Vic, he accepts a job at Ian's restaurant as a waiter. Denise feels <b>awkward</b> <b>and</b> confesses the truth to Ian, but doesn't mention Fatboy's name. Fatboy spends time away from Walford caring for his uncle when he falls ill, and, on his return, Dot suggests that he finds a new place to live, due to Charlie moving in with her and her only being allowed one lodger by council regulations. When Charlie's son is born, Fatboy is unsuccessful in persuading Charlie to take the baby home. He follows Charlie home and discovers that Nick is alive. When Charlie later moves out, Fatboy moves back in with Dot. On Ladies' Night at the Vic, Fatboy consoles Denise when their kiss during the engagement party is revealed. Tina visits Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) to find Fatboy with her.|$|E

50|$|Many Chinese psychiatrists {{believed}} the CCMD had special advantages over other manuals, such as simplicity, stability, {{the inclusion of}} culture-distinctive categories, and the exclusion of certain Western diagnostic categories. The Chinese translation of the ICD-10 was seen as linguistically complicated, containing very long sentences <b>and</b> <b>awkward</b> terms <b>and</b> syntax (Lee, 2001).|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{invention}} of this type, coils of sheet steel were carried on end or in cradles in open or covered gondolas. Load shifting, damage, <b>and</b> <b>awkward</b> loading <b>and</b> unloading were all problems, and since so much sheet steel is transported, a specialized car was designed for this use.|$|R
5|$|Fatboy begins {{running the}} car lot when Charlie leaves Walford. His {{friendship}} with Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) grows {{and they have}} a one-night stand, but, feeling it is making their friendship weird, he rejects her afterwards despite her thinking she might have deeper feelings for him. Things between them are <b>awkward,</b> <b>and</b> when Donna's foster brother Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) finds out, he confronts Fatboy and locks him a cupboard. He returns the next day to find that Fatboy has not been discovered, and from how scared Fatboy is, realises something is wrong. Fatboy opens up about the fact his mother used to lock him up for extended periods of time, which led to him assuming the comedic persona of 'Fatboy'. Vincent convinces him to use his real name, Arthur, again, and gives him a job as DJ at his bar The Albert as long as he no longer puts on a false persona, starting with admitting to Donna that he will now be showing his true self to her. Over the coming weeks, Fatboy gets tangled in Vincent's vendetta against the Mitchell family and trying to kill Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Fatboy repeatedly tries to convince Vincent to stop, and interrupts Vincent when as he is about to throttle Phil. Fed up with his interference, Vincent threatens Fatboy with violence against Dot if he does not leave Walford forever. Fatboy tells Dot {{that he is going to}} see his father for Christmas, and shares a final dinner with her before saying goodbye. He confronts Vincent one last time, demanding that he stay away from Dot, and leaves Walford.|$|E

25|$|While {{working with}} Armando Iannucci on On the Hour and The Day Today, Coogan created his most {{developed}} and popular character: Alan Partridge, a socially <b>awkward</b> <b>and</b> politically incorrect regional media personality.

A feature-length film, , {{was released in}} 2013, and opened at number one at the British box office.|$|E

25|$|Because {{double and}} single track may use {{different}} signalling systems, {{it may be}} <b>awkward</b> <b>and</b> confusing to mix double and single track too often. For example, intermediate mechanical signal boxes on a double-track line can be closed during periods of light traffic, but this cannot be done {{if there is a}} single-line section in between. This problem is less serious with electrical signalling such as Centralized traffic control.|$|E

However, she believes herself in love with Captain Frederic Aylmer, although he has given no clear signs of feeling that way toward her. Aylmer is impeccable in his manners, smooth, urbane, well-read, {{and a member of}} Parliament; compared to him, Belton is <b>awkward</b> <b>and</b> unpolished.|$|E
50|$|At panel, Lianna {{received}} {{rave reviews}} for her trampoline photo, though Lisa {{said that her}} walk was stiff <b>and</b> <b>awkward.</b> Sarah <b>and</b> Amber are praised for having their best photos so far.

50|$|Loading a {{cylinder}} {{in this manner}} was a slow <b>and</b> <b>awkward</b> process <b>and</b> generally could not {{be done in the}} midst of battle.
