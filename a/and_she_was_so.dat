500|$|Series creator Ilene Chaiken created Jennifer. She based {{her on her}} {{own past}} {{experiences}} of coming out {{and dealing with the}} everyday life in the lesbian community as a younger woman. Like Jenny, Chaiken had befriended a group of lesbians who ran a cafe and had her first sexual encounter with a female. Actress Mia Kirshner was cast in the role. Chaiken admitted she had been searching for the right actress to play Jennifer [...] "for a long time". Kirshner auditioned via video tape, Chaiken recalled that upon viewing it she thought Kirshner was [...] "stunning". She thought Kirshner had [...] "riveting beauty that is unlike anyone else's, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> deep and intense." ...|$|E
500|$|Tess Harper was {{performing}} {{on stage in}} Texas when she attended a casting call for a minor role in the film. Beresford {{was so impressed with}} her that he cast her in the lead. He later said that the actresses he had seen before her demonstrated a sophistication and worldliness inappropriate for the part, while she brought a kind of rural quality without coming across as simple or foolish. Beresford said of Harper, [...] "She walked into the room and even before she spoke, I thought, 'That's the girl to play the lead. Harper said she knew she won the role when Beresford appeared on her doorstep with a bottle of champagne in each hand. Tender Mercies was Harper's feature film debut, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> excited about the role she bit her script {{to make sure it was}} real. When filming ended, Duvall gave her a blue cowgirl shirt as a gift with a card that read, [...] "You really were Rosa Lee".|$|E
500|$|Richard and Molly had ten children. The first child, Mary, {{was born}} in 1794. She was {{followed}} by another girl, who died almost at once; Joseph in 1796; and another son in 1798, who died in infancy. In December that year, the oldest child, then four years old, died after her clothes caught fire, possibly while adding wood shavings to the fire. The incident {{was reported in the}} Bath Chronicle on 27 December 1798: [...] "A child, four years of age of Mr. R. Anning, a cabinetmaker of Lyme, was left by the mother for about five minutes ... in a room where there were some shavings ... The girl's clothes caught fire <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> dreadfully burnt as to cause her death." [...] When another daughter was born just five months later, she was named Mary after her dead sister. More children were born after her, but none of them survived {{more than a couple of}} years. Only Mary and Joseph survived to adulthood. The high childhood mortality rate for the Anning family was not very unusual. Almost half the children born in Britain throughout the 19th century died before the age of 5, and in the crowded living conditions of early 19th century Lyme Regis, infant deaths from diseases like smallpox and measles were particularly common.|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> <b>so</b> sad, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> patient <b>and</b> so energetic," [...] said Grace, {{using her}} {{favourite}} monosyllable in peace, out of Rachel's hearing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well now, you are {{the first}} person who has ever said that," [...] the woman said, surprised. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>so</b> short, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> tall." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well--very much. I like to {{hear her}} talk. <b>She</b> entertains me; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> {{extremely}} pretty, that I have great pleasure in looking at her." ...|$|R
500|$|Preparing for {{the episode}} was {{physically}} difficult {{for some of}} the cast members, most of whom had little experience singing and dancing. They spent three months in voice training. Two choreographers worked with Whedon and the cast on dance sequences. Michelle Trachtenberg (Dawn), who is trained in ballet, requested a dance sequence in lieu of a significant singing part, and Alyson Hannigan (Willow), according to Whedon, begged him not to give her many lines. Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy) told the BBC that [...] "It took something like 19hours of singing and 17hours of dancing in between shooting four other episodes" [...] <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> anxious about singing that she [...] "hated every moment of it". When Whedon suggested using a voice double for her, however, she said, [...] "I basically started to cry and said, 'You mean someone else is going to do my big emotional turning point for the season?' In the end, it was an incredible experience and I'm glad I did it. And I never want to do it again." [...] Davies was so impressed with Hinton Battle's performance on Broadway in The Wiz that he asked Battle to play the demon Sweet. Battle, a three-time Tony-winner, wore prosthetic make-up {{for the first time to}} give him a demonic red face. Sweet was portrayed as [...] "slick", smooth and stylish; in contrast, most demons on the series were designed to be crude and ugly. The set for The Bronze was used frequently throughout the series, but stairs were built from the stage to maximize floor space for Battle's dance.|$|E
2500|$|Webb {{performed}} [...] "Almost Like Being in Love" [...] as her audition piece, {{before a}} group that included Newley, Lionel Bart, Lionel Blair and Alma Cogan. The group shared a joke during her audition which distracted her {{and at the end}} of the piece, she grabbed her music and went to leave the stage. Newley had to stop her to ask for another song <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> embarrassed, she dropped her sheet music across the stage. Newley later remarked that he'd loved her from that moment on. The company would go out together to watch other shows and performers, including Lotte Lenya and Ethel Merman.|$|E
60|$|Lilian {{could not}} escape without {{attracting}} attention, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> close to the two men that she heard Brandram Maxwell sigh.|$|E
6000|$|... "Talk French, please, Rupert. Margot will {{understand}} then; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> brave <b>and</b> good, and shares my danger, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> ought to <b>be</b> {{as one of}} us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will try," [...] said Bessie. [...] "And please, Papa, {{would you}} tell Nurse about it? She doesn't half believe us, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> {{tiresome}} about Miss Fosbrook!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{know it is}} not an embellishing dress, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> {{did look}} gaunt and haggard; but still somehow we liked her better than ever before; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> very good <b>and</b> charitable.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Kate's {{eyes flashed}} at this; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> angry, that no words would come but a passionate {{stammering}} [...] "I can't--I can't leave off; I won't!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Alas! If the King is killed, {{what will}} become of me and of my little daughter?' <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> sorrowful that she could neither eat nor sleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Each wants me, to do {{the other}} good," [...] thought Kate; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> much touched and pleased {{that she did not}} know what to do, and looked foolish.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Presently, I hope,' said Mr. Kendal, with {{an uneasy}} glance towards Miss Meadows, 'she has seen no one as yet, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> {{determined}} that you cannot come till after Christmas, {{that she does}} not expect you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My sister Magdalen, do you mean? Well, we {{have not}} {{introduced}} him to her yet. You see, he is ONLY painting the church, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> devoted to swells, and makes such a fuss about our manners." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Somehow {{she looks}} <b>so</b> cool, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> entirely the last girl I {{expected}} to go crazy, that I can't laugh at the thing as I ought! I say, what's this about Miss Charlecote; will she do anything for him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Another thing,' said Amy, {{colouring}} a good deal; 'shall {{you mind}} my telling Mary? I behaved so oddly last night, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> {{kind to me}} that I think I ought.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{will you}} tell Grandmamma?' said Jane, with her pretty look of earnestness; 'she is so much afraid of its much for me, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> kind in letting me come.' ...|$|E
60|$|She {{glanced at}} his watch; it was seven o'clock. He was still {{completely}} asleep. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> hard awake, it was almost frightening--a hard, metallic wakefulness. She lay looking at him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} help it!" [...] he went on. [...] "She did look <b>so</b> lovely, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> dear! Do get her down, that I may see her again. I shall not have a happy moment till she answers me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Those verses, {{they came}} all limp and wet {{out of his}} pocket, and Francie made him let her dry them and copy them out; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> delighted with them. It really is well {{it is too late}} to call the baby Cyriac." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That man!" [...] cried Angela. [...] "I {{have heard}} of him! He is a regular mealy-mouthed old woman of a doctor! <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> well just now! How horrid to shake her up again! Oh, Bear! if I could only sail away with her to Queensland!" ...|$|R
60|$|Emma had not {{had time}} even to think of Mr. Elton, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> {{completely}} surprized {{that she could not}} avoid a little start, and a little blush, at the sound.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha! ha! ha! Poor Mrs. Shortpointz! <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> full of {{you last}} night. The beau ideal of manly beauty! {{that was what}} she called you. She did indeed. Ha! ha! ha!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, never: {{we might}} do what we pleased; ransack her desk and her workbox, and turn her drawers inside out; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> good-natured, she would give us {{anything}} we asked for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is a {{very nice}} child, indeed, Mr. Dale. <b>She</b> could not <b>be</b> nicer. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> lovely." [...] Then Mr. Dale looked into his young companion's face, struck by the sudden {{animation}} of her words, and perceived {{for the first time}} that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> very pretty.|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{cannot be}} hard upon him," [...] said the archdeacon. [...] "He <b>is</b> <b>so</b> scandalously weak, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> radically vicious, that they cannot but be wrong together. The {{very fact that}} such a man should be a bishop among us is to me terribly strong {{evidence}} of evil days coming." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> happy I don't {{know what}} she will do to you," [...] began Mr. Bhaer, but got no farther, for here the boys came {{crowding}} about Dan in a tumult of pleasure and curiosity; but before he had answered {{more than a dozen}} questions, a voice cried out, ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What! He {{wants to}} marry me?' said the scissors, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> angry that she gave the collar a sharp snip, so {{that it had to}} be cast aside as good for nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Must not I wear it, mamma?' said Constance, who had {{a certain}} {{attachment}} to the beautiful and comfortable garment. 'She {{told me she had}} only worn it once in London, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> very kind.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never too late," [...] {{said the}} fairy, {{in such a}} strange soft new voice that Tom looked up at her; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> {{beautiful}} for the moment, that Tom half fancied she was her sister.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sure of it. She told me so. Everybody {{has always}} {{been talking about it}} ever since <b>she</b> <b>was</b> born, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> says <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> sick of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear Winifred, as if I had not sat up till twelve {{last night}} laying them before Albinia. How sick the poor child must be of our arguments, {{when there is}} no real objection, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> much attached! Have you heard {{anything}} about these connexions of his? Did you not write to Mrs. Nugent? I wish <b>she</b> <b>were</b> at home.' ...|$|R
50|$|Her {{mother-in-law}} {{wrote the}} following in her memoirs:all the ladies in waiting {{have made her}} believe that she did my son honour in marrying him; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> vain of her own birth and that of her brothers <b>and</b> sisters that <b>she</b> will not hear a word said against them; she will not see any difference between legitimate and illegitimate children.|$|R
