50|$|In 1985 a {{group of}} local people formed the Congleton Museum Trust. They {{collected}} artefacts, raised money and searched the town for premises suitable for a museum. In the mid-1990s, a second group of people, who planned to refurbish Congleton Town Hall {{with the help of}} Regeneration Funding, became involved, and a museum was written into the refurbishment plans. The former police station, a Victorian building which was part of the town hall complex, was proposed as the museum. The Heritage Lottery Fund awarded the project over £200,000, and other local and national trusts, businesses and local authorities <b>assisted.</b> <b>Building</b> work started in January 2002, and Congleton Museum opened on 29 July 2002. It was officially opened by the Duke of Gloucester later that year.|$|E

On 13 September, the regiment replaced the 3rd Stryker Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division at Camp Liberty, Baghdad as part of President George W. Bush's surge campaign. 1st Squadron (War Eagles), with Troops A, B, and C, was sent to NE Baghdad to work in Sadr City, Hayy Ur, Thawra, Jamilla, and Adhamiyah. They conducted numerous cordon-and-search, checkpoint, and raid missions until the Jaysh al-Mahdi uprising in March 2008. Joining with Iraqi Army and Iraqi Police, 1st Squadron fought these insurgents until a ceasefire was brokered on 11 March. The squadron <b>assisted</b> <b>building</b> a security wall in Sadr City and conducted many civic action projects until it was sent to Mosul in August 2008 to assist the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment quell the violence in that city.|$|E
50|$|Barclay {{was born}} to a Scottish mother and an English father. At age four, he {{performed}} marionettes, glove and rod puppets with his parents, Ann and Michael who formed Pex Puppet Theatre focusing their acting talents on live puppetry. When he was seven, Barclay performed traditional Punch and Judy at the British Puppet Guild, for documentary cameras. Throughout his childhood, he designed built and performed dozens of his own puppets and continued performing Punch and Judy into his late teens. He worked for other live puppet companies, Jactito, directors James and Joan Barton, and Cap and Bells, director Violet Philpott. His first work in front of camera was a brief appearance as a large dog in the British classic comedy series The Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show. This was in 1978 for Thames TV. In July 1979 he was offered the position of make up assistant working for Stuart Freeborn on the second Star Wars film The Empire Strikes Back. The main challenge was a state-of-the-art hand puppet named Yoda, and Barclay <b>assisted</b> <b>building</b> duplicate parts, seaming the foam latex head skins, etc., but when Wendy Midener Froud became allergic to something on the set, he was drafted in as a puppeteer. Dave performed the cable controlled facial movements for Muppet master Frank Oz, the chief puppeteer. When Oz {{had to return to}} New York City to shoot Sesame Street, as the production had run over, Oz nominated Barclay to take over as chief puppeteer for Yoda. Barclay was then invited to become the first British puppet maker on a new adventurous project by Jim Henson and Frank Oz, The Dark Crystal. In November 1979, he joined a handful of Henson's American puppet makers, to develop puppets that would finally become the entire cast of the movie. And so started the long term relationship and desire to push the envelope in animatronic performance art.|$|E

40|$|The {{architectural}} {{research on}} provision of computational {{support for the}} building delivery process in general and computer aided performance modelling in particular has traditionally concentrated on the building design phase. This paper argues that computational modelling can also successfully apply to the building operation phase. To demonstrate this potential the paper explores a simulation- <b>assisted</b> <b>building</b> control strategy. Specifically, the use of generate-and-test as well as bi-directional inference methods is proposed to derive preferable control schemes and required attributes for control variables based on parametric and iterative simulation runs. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated via illustrative computational examples from the thermal control domain...|$|E
40|$|Building {{automation}} integrates {{the active}} components {{in a building}} and, thus, has to connect components of different industries. The goal is to provide reliable and efficient operation. This paper describes how simulation can support building automation and how the deployment process of simulation <b>assisted</b> <b>building</b> control systems can be structured. We look at the process {{as a whole and}} map it to a set of formally described workflows that can partly be automated. A workbench environment supports the process execution by means of improved planning, collaboration and deployment. This framework allows integration of existing tools, as well as manual tasks, and is, therefore, many more intricate than regular software deployment tools. The complex environment of building commissioning requires expertise in different domains, especially lighting, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, measurement and control technology, as well as energy efficiency; therefore, we present a framework for building commissioning and describe a deployment process that is capable of supporting the various phases of this approach...|$|E
40|$|The {{operations}} software {{group at}} the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility faces a number of challenges common to facilities managing {{a large body of}} software developed in-house. Developers include members of the software group, operators, hardware engineers and accelerator physicists. One management problem has been ensuring that all software has an identified maintainer who is still working at the lab. In some cases, locating source code for ’orphaned ’ software has also proven to be difficult. Other challenges include enforcing minimal standards for versioning and documentation, segregating test software from operational software, encouraging better code reuse, consolidating input/output file storage and management, and tracking software dependencies. This paper will describe a relational database model for tracking the information necessary to solve the problems above. The instantiation of that database model provides the foundation for various productivity-and consistency- enhancing tools for automated (or at least <b>assisted)</b> <b>building,</b> versioning, documenting and installation of software. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - There {{has been}} a growing public concern over the {{importance}} of building management in apartment buildings. However, people's views toward the effects of building management on building performance have long been divergent {{due to a lack}} of empirical study. This study aims to empirically test the relationship between building management regimes and the conditions of private apartment buildings in Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach - An assessment scheme was developed to assess the health and safety conditions of 134 apartment buildings. Multiple regression models were then applied to analyze the effect of building management regimes on building conditions. The optimal functional form of the regression models was selected using Box-Cox transformation. Findings - The empirical results suggested that the presence of incorporated owners and property management agents (PMA) are significant factors in enhancing building conditions. Research limitations/implications - The sample was confined to single block buildings located in one particular district in Hong Kong. Further research is needed to validate the findings in estate-type developments as well as those in other districts. Practical implications - The empirical results <b>assisted</b> <b>building</b> owners in determining which management regimes to adopt should they want better building conditions. The government may also consider giving more support to owners by incorporating them and employing PMAs to create a pleasant living environment for society. Originality/value - Our study is the first in the literature to provide an empirical test reconciling the divergent views toward the effects of building management with the conditions of buildings. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
