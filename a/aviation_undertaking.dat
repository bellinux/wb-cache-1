This paper presents the challenges and opportunities for the evolution of the certification framework, considering the Global Air Navigation Plan (GANP) of International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and major air transport modernisation programs including, inter alia, the Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research (SESAR) of Europe, Next Generation Air Transport System (NextGen) of the United States and OneSky of Australia. A critical review is carried out on the existing regulatory frameworks of the concerned aviation authorities namely the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the Federal Aviation Administrator (FAA), the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) and the ICAO in relation to certification, in order to identify the key areas requiring further developments. Furthermore, a review of current industry standards in relation to hardware and software design, development, test &amp; evaluation together with available standards for safety assessment are also presented, highlighting the outstanding gaps which should be fulfilled to achieve an integrated Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) system certification.

Most recently, the T- 33 and flight profiles, developed under the research, have been applied to the comparative measurement of jet biofuel emissions. During {{the course of the}} project, techniques have been developed, for the derivation of estimated Emission Indices (EI) of pollutant species, measured on the ground (during taxy, departure or arrival runway operations) or inflight. In particular, if the jet engine exhaust jet streams were very young, air temperature measurements were used to correlate to empirically modeled turbulent jet mixing fluid dynamics, thereby deriving the applicable dilution factors (DF) to apply to the measured concentrations. For exhaust plumes which were not very young (i. e. not in a state of turbulent mixing, but rather in a state of turbulent or quiescent diffusion), flight data has involved techniques for the full cross-sectional measurement of wakes, including jet wake and wake vortex regimes. Not only has this captured the nature of wake structures under very strong static and dynamic influences, but permitted the measurement of aerosol emission index numbers directly. 9 2012 by The Crown in Right of Canada.

40|$|In Australia, the General Aviation (GA) sector {{exhibits}} a much poorer safety record than the airline industry; it {{is responsible for}} 93 % of fatal accidents, whilst representing only 55 % of the total flight hours. Leading factors said {{to account for the}} high fatality rate in GA include human error and poor decisionâmaking; as a result, a concerted effort has been made to improve pilotâ decisionâmaking in GA. However, these efforts have not clearly addressed the role of attitudes in effective and safe behaviour (Thomas, 2004). In a similar vein, poor (or inferior) risk perception has been identified as a possible âholeâ in the defence of accidents in the literature (Reason, 1990). Therefore, the main aim of present study was to investigate the link between pilot attitude, risk perception, flight experience and risky flight behaviour. In order to do this, three experiments were undertaken. The first experiment involved the use of a questionnaire designed to investigate the link between pilotsâ attitude, risk perception and experiential data. The second experiment was designed to examine selfâreported riskâtaking behaviour of pilots. It therefore involved the use of a questionnaire to gather selfâreports of intended behaviour. The third experiment was designed to investigate flight behaviour in a simulated highârisk situation and augment this behavioural data with an interview to gain further insight into the causal factors of pilotsâ risk management behaviour. The results revealed that in Australian GA, older pilots, those with more flight hours, or those that fly regularly did not exhibit superior perception of the risks in a given situation than their younger or less experienced counterparts. They did however exhibit lower levels of selfâconfidence (attitude). This finding differs from <b>aviation</b> research <b>undertaken</b> in the United States (Hunter, 2005), where risk perception and attitude were both related to experience. In terms of behaviour, risk perception was found to be the only predictor of effective risk management behaviour. Therefore, holding a âgoodâ attitude, or having a higher level of experience appeared to have no influence on the decisions by pilots as to their risk management behaviour. It is important to highlight that the sample in this research is different than that in the US research; the results obtained in this research are based upon a relatively small cohort of pilots that are limited in terms of their experience, age and vocation. Specifically, no airline pilots were included in this study, only General Aviation and trainee pilots were utilised.

40|$|A {{quarter of}} all fatal General Aviation {{accidents}} in the UK during the period 1980 to 2006 involved Loss of Control (LoC) in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC).

This raises two important questions - why do these LoC events happen and why {{is there a difference}} between aircraft types?. The biggest discrepancy affects the Cessna 150 and Cessna 152, two aircraft similar in appearance and highly popular in the pilot training environment.

Brunel Flight Safety Laboratory, in conjunction with the UK General <b>Aviation</b> Safety Council, <b>undertook</b> to try and understand why. The key design differences affecting performance and handling qualities were thoroughly researched using available published material and informal interviews with type-experienced students, pilots and flying instructors. A comprehensive flight test programme was then commenced using examples of both aircraft types to gather additional research data in order to assess and compare the apparent performance and handling qualities (both qualitatively and quantitatively).

40|$|In {{order to}} deal with the {{competitive}} environment surrounding the air transport industry, civil <b>aviation</b> authorities have <b>undertaken</b> several approaches to improve airport efficiency, such as investing in the infrastructure and privatising airport ownership or governance. Among these methods, airport privatisation policy has been implemented for around 25 years in the U. K., closely followed by other European countries. By contrast, decision makers elsewhere, such as in the Asia-Pacific region, are now interested in privatisation and in doing so evaluate the impact of this process elsewhere. Focussing on the most popular method for assessing airport efficiency, with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) a unit can appear efficient simply because of its pattern of inputs and outputs rather than any inherent efficiency. But only using DEA may not provide useful results about the efficiency of airports as different decision makers may weight the relative importance of inputs and outputs differently (for example, airport managers, and airline companies). In this research, another aim is to develop and demonstrate the applicability of different analysis techniques within the AEES. For this reason, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) analysis is adopted to calculate the importance of each variable. These results are then integrated into both DEA and DEA, Assurance Region (AR) models, to reflect the different importance of the metrics. In the context of air transportation, an integrated AHP/DEA and AHP/DEA-AR model are applied {{for the first time to}} evaluate airport efficiency. A sensitivity analysis with different variable sets is carried out. In conclusion, an AEES is established and the result shows that the approach by adopting AHP/DEA-AR model in particular can provide more accurate values of relative efficiency than using the traditional DEA approach. There are also different priorities between stakeholder groups and these can affect the efficiency scores of airports. However, the results for each of the different analysis techniques show that there is no statistically significant relationship between airport ownership and efficiency. Therefore, the primary aim of this research is to examine the relationship between airport privatisation and efficiency, through an Airport Efficiency Evaluation System (AEES). The study covers Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, reflecting different attitudes towards the role of government within airport management. Focussing on the most popular method for assessing airport efficiency, wit...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the ways in}} which supply side cost pressures are expressed in the aviation industry. It is motivated by the desire to inform policy development efforts aimed at introducing mitigatory measures for <b>aviation</b> emissions. Studies <b>undertaken</b> to date to estimate the impacts of emissions policies have included an exhaustive discussion of demand side effects but have had little mention of supply side responses. The purpose of this thesis is to discuss the supply side reaction to cost changes and provide empirical findings to better inform simulation studies as well as to motivate more realistic theoretical models. This study starts by introducing the current administrative issues as well as the most recent technical knowledge concerning the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions emanating from passenger aircraft. The structure and limitations of the Kyoto Protocol and European Emissions Trading System are discussed and the potential operational, technological and economic tools available for mitigation efforts are presented. In this context a review of the current carbon emissions simulation literature is conducted with particular attention to the treatment of carbon cost pass-through. The pass-through rate, which represents the proportion of cost changes passed through to ticket prices, is a key determinant of the equilibrium response. The simplified assumptions used in many studies are compared with a number of theoretical models and found to be at odds with the vast range of likely scenarios suggested under economic theory. Furthermore, it is found that the economic theory itself often results in indeterminate conclusions. Hence, on the basis that this cost pass-through is an empirical question, a unique dataset of directional itinerary level ticket price data is formed using U. S. DOT data which is combined with associated disaggregate data on aircraft; passenger; airline financial; scheduling; flight operations; economic; and demographic variables. The dataset is used to identifying the structural and operational responses of airlines to large increases in input costs. It is apparent that during {{the first decade of the}} 21 st century in the U. S., airlines intensely resisted increasing fare costs in response to increased input costs but instead opted to pursue aggressive efficiency improvements. Further, these efficiency improvements were accompanied by quality and quantity changes to service offerings that transformed airlines’ final products. Where airlines did increase prices, these were generally realized through instruments such as fuel surcharges, ancillary fees and check-in charges that resulted in increased levels of information asymmetry experienced by passengers, which in turn enabled airlines to maintain low headline ticket prices while increasing total trip costs. Next, a dynamic GMM model is employed to produce the first empirical estimates of fuel cost pass-through using itinerary specific fuel costs onto passenger ticket prices. Pass-through rates are then presented for a variety of market conditions and the results are found to lend themselves directly to validating assumptions in future U. S. emissions impact studies and broader studies concerning cost transmission in the aviation industry. Finally, this thesis presents the first application of the asymmetric pass-through literature for the case of the aviation industry. Testing for three different types of asymmetry, the results from these models confirm that there are significant downward pressures on ticket prices with input cost decreases being passed through both more quickly and to a greater degree than input cost increases...|$|R
