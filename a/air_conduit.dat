The secondary bronchi included four medioventral (MVSB), 7 - 10 laterodorsal (LDSB), 1 - 3 lateroventral (LVSB), several sacobronchi, and 20 - 60 posterior secondary bronchi (POSB). The latter category has not been described before and is best discerned from the internal aspect of the mesobronchus. The secondary bronchi emerged directly from the mesobronchus, except for the sacobronchi, which sprouted from the air sacs. Parabronchi from the first MVSB coursed craniodorsally and inosculated their cognates from the first two LDSB. The parabronchi {{from the rest of}} the LDSB curved dorsomedially to join those {{from the rest of the}} MVSB at the dorsal border.

Additionally, better endowed cells squeeze out adjacent cells or such cells constrict spontaneously thus extruding the squeezed out aposome. Formation of vesicles or vacuoles below the aposome and fusion of such cavities with their neighboring cognates results in severing of the aposome.

Several visualization techniques that included corrosion casting, light microscopy as well as scanning and transmission electron microscopy were used. Two to six infundibulae extend from each atrium and give rise to numerous ACs that spread centrifugally. Majority of the ACs are tubular structures that give off branches, which anastomose with their neighboring cognates. Some ACs have globular shapes and a few are blind-ending tapering tubes. During inauguration, the luminal aspects of the ACs are characterized by numerous microvillus-like microplicae, which are formed during the complex processes of cell attenuation and canalization of the ACs. The parabronchial exchange BCs, initially inaugurated as disorganized meshworks, are reoriented via pillar formation to lie predominantly orthogonal to the long axes of the ACs. The remodeling of the retiform meshworks by intussusceptive angiogenesis essentially accomplishes a cross-current system at the gas exchange interface in the adults, where BCs form ring-like patterns around the ACs, thus establishing a cross-current system.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{for improving the}} performance of electrostatic transducers that comprise a thin membrane positioned above a conducting backplate is presented. The concept has its foundations in the normally tubular sections used for amplification of sound in musical instruments, where the resonant frequency of a fluid filled conduit {{is determined by the}} conduit length. Finite Element Modelling was used to evaluate a range of potential configurations, including conduit aspect ratio and the membrane - cavity structure immediately above the conduit (ie membrane dimensions, cavity width and depth). Results are presented that reveal the potential variation in amplification and these demonstrate that under certain conditions, a very significant improvement can be obtained. For example, at a centre frequency of 215 kHz, a conduit with an aspect ratio of 10 : 1 will produce a tenfold increase in displacement at the membrane end of the system. Although this is achievable over a wide frequency range, the best overall performance in terms of absolute sound pressure level was obtained when the length of the conduit was matched to the centre frequency of the vibrating membrane. Proof of concept devices were manufactured and tested experimentally, for both quarter wavelength and half wavelength conditions. Laser vibrometry was used to measure the displacement of the membrane, while a calibrated PVDF hydrophone and electret microphone were employed to measure the acoustic output {{at the end of the}} conduit. The presence of the vibrating <b>air</b> <b>conduits</b> was observed to increase the measured acoustic output by a factor greater than 20 dB. The results confirm that the prototype devices can operate efficiently at both ends of the system and the membrane can be excited effectively by the air column.

50|$|The tramway {{was one of}} {{very few}} in England {{operated}} with a Griffiths-Bedell Stud contact system in the roadway. This initial method of power provision survived until 1919 when this was replaced with overhead wires. The reason for the replacement was that gas leaked from the mains which {{found its way into}} the electric power cable conduit. This appeared in a startling and dangerous manner, as the gas ignitied by the arcing of the magnetic switches, with the result that the cast iron covers for the inspection boxes were blown off, and on more than one occasion, hurled into the air. To minimise the risk of explosion, and electric blower was installed at the Depot, and was started up every morning before the first car left the Depot, and this blew a current of <b>air</b> through the <b>conduit,</b> clearing it of any gas.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Macrotermitinae mounds could hold the key for designing a naturally ventilated human habitation using the sustainable Solar and Wind energies. Few {{attempts were made to}} mimic these structures into man build structures to achieve natural ventilation. Yet the limited understanding of the ventilation mechanisms applied in these mounds and the lack of fully developed building technologies capable of implementing such complex designs have prevented its further implementation in human habitation. A number of ventilation mechanisms were proposed, however, they are yet to be established. A prerequisite for a thorough understanding of the ventilation mechanism is the comprehension {{of the role of the}} mound skin in controlling of ventilation. This thesis focused on studying the flow through the porous mound skin into and out of the mound interior and the flow around the external skin surface. The Macrotermes michaelseni mound structure was visualised and studied in detail by means of field experiments to reveal its plaster-filled internal structure and digital scanning of a plaster-filled mound. The dimensions and interconnectivity of the internal conduits were examined to establish the source of maximum flow resistance. The mound skin and the built-in egress channels were found to be responsible for the bulk of the flow resistance. Computational Fluid dynamics CFD was used to predict the flow rates through the mound skin structure and the internal and external flow patterns. A series of Micro-CFD simulations were conducted to examine the effect of egress channel on the predicted flow rate through the porous mound skin. The effect of the mound conical shape on the external pressure distribution and flow patterns around and within the mound were predicted by Macro-CFD simulation. Wind tunnel experiments were conducted to validate the Macro-CFD analysis. Egress channels are present across the height of the mound stemming from a network of surface conduits that is directly below the mound skin. The surface conduits are highly connected to each other, to the mound central chimney and to the nest structure via peripheral subterranean conduits creating a highly connected network of <b>air</b> <b>conduits.</b> Egress channels keep the mound internal conduits separate from the ambient environment under normal conditions of dry weather. These channels are opened to the skin external surface under rainy conditions to compensate for mound skin diminished air permeability. The flow through the mound skin with closed egress channels is highly sensitive to changes in the egress channel depth from the external skin surface rather than changes in the skin thickness. Closed egress channels within the mound skin doubles the flow rate through the mound. This exceeds the amount necessary for the colony metabolism to allow for part of the inflow to circulate the mound conduits and leave without reaching the subterranean nest structure. Open egress channels increase the flow rate by 1. 3 times that of closed egress channels which is necessary during rainy conditions where the mound skin is impermeable. The mound spire is the most efficient in capturing air flow into the mound allowing just under 70...|$|R
30|$|In the laboratory, we {{observed}} transitions between bubbling (9 (c)) {{and an open}} conduit (9 (d)), which is a feature of gas transport through such visco-elastic shear-thinning fluid with appropriate combinations of viscosity and gas flux (Divoux et al., 2009, 2011). In the bubbling regime, only pressure sensors beneath the fluid detect pressure perturbations generated by the valve, while acoustic waves in the air are impulsive. The regularity of the valve oscillation is disturbed by pressure fluctuations associated with bubble growth and release from the tube (9 (c)). HT generated by the valve oscillation is transmitted to the <b>air</b> when a <b>conduit</b> is established through the fluid (9 (d)), which only occurred with high fluid viscosity, resulting in clear and more stable harmonics. When we use water instead of the visco-elastic fluid (9 (b)), the pressure fluctuation generated by bubbles is too large to establish regular oscillation of the valve and no HT is generated.|$|R
