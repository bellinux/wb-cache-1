5|$|Next, riders board an enchanted bench {{inside the}} Room of Requirement, which lifts {{off the ground}} and through the Floo Network for a journey with Harry. The ride {{combines}} real sets and <b>animatronics</b> with segments that use wrap-around projection screens.|$|E
5|$|The film {{features}} the first aquatic Skynet robot, the Hydrobot, which Laing modeled on eels, and {{was built by}} the <b>animatronics</b> crew with its exterior made of metal-looking rubber {{so it could be}} used in the aquatic scenes.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} arcade, the other main draw for the centers since the {{beginning}} was its animatronic show, until the mid-1990s. More recently, less attention {{has been placed on}} <b>animatronics.</b> However, there are now several different styles of animatronic shows in use within the company, depending on when the location opened, whether it was renovated, and other factors.|$|E
5|$|Five Nights at Freddy's 4 reintroduces removed tools, {{specifically}} {{the doors and}} flashlight, albeit with slightly altered usage. The doors can only be closed when the player is next to them, and will re-open if the player moves away. However, if the player shuts the doors too early, the <b>animatronics</b> will jump scare the player when the door is opened. The flashlight can no-longer run out, but only alerts player {{to the presence of}} <b>animatronics</b> as opposed to warding them away, excluding the miniature Freddies that appear on the bed. If the player flashes the flashlight while an animatronic is in the doorway, the player will be jumpscared. There is one new mechanic, where the player must listen for breathing audio. This can determine whether to use the flashlight or close the door.|$|E
5|$|After being {{stalled in}} the {{development}} phase for nearly a decade, the film's principal photography began in 2008 and lasted two years. The film marked the debut of Legacy Effects studio (which {{was responsible for the}} film's prosthetic make-up and <b>animatronics)</b> in Indian cinema. Enthiran was released worldwide on 1October2010, along with its dubbed versions: Robot in Hindi and Robo in Telugu. Produced by Kalanithi Maran, it was India's most expensive film up to that point.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} {{attempted to}} limit the use of digital effects. However, {{because he wanted to}} evoke a Southern Gothic fantasy tone for Big Fish, color grading techniques were applied by Sony Pictures Imageworks. Stan Winston Studios, with whom Burton worked with on Edward Scissorhands (1990) and Batman Returns (1992), designed Helena Bonham Carter's prosthetic makeup and created the <b>animatronics.</b> Scenes with Karl the Giant were commissioned using forced perspective filmmaking.|$|E
5|$|A montage shows {{visitors}} on {{the rides}} at Walt Disney World Resort {{and the many}} visuals and <b>animatronics</b> that accompany the rides. It ends with a man losing his head while riding Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. On {{the last day of}} a family vacation at Walt Disney World, Jim White gets fired by his boss during a phone call on the balcony of the Contemporary Resort Hotel with his family. He keeps the news to himself to avoid spoiling their vacation. The family leaves their room and takes the monorail to the park, alongside two French teenagers, Isabelle and Sophie.|$|E
5|$|In November 1979, Brock met Aaron Fechter of Creative Engineering, Inc. Concerned that Fechter's <b>animatronics</b> {{would be}} too strong a {{competition}} for Bushnell’s work, Brock requested that Bushnell release him from the co-development agreement, citing misrepresentation. In December 1979, Brock and Fechter formed “Showbiz Pizza Place Inc”, severing Brock's business relationship with Bushnell. ShowBiz Pizza Place was conceptually identical to Pizza Time Theatre in all aspects except for animation, which would be provided by Creative Engineering. Showbiz Pizza Place opened its first location on March 3, 1980, in Kansas City, Missouri.|$|E
5|$|R. Rathnavelu {{was hired}} as the cinematographer after Ravi K. Chandran, Nirav Shah and Thiru were considered. Anthony was the film's editor. Yuen Woo Ping, known {{for his work in}} The Matrix trilogy and the Kill Bill films, was {{selected}} to be the stunt co-ordinator, while Legacy Effects, a visual effects studio based in the United States, were in charge of the prosthetic make-up and <b>animatronics</b> in the film. Munich-based film technical company, Panther, were responsible for the crane shots. The film's subtitle captioning was done by Rekha Haricharan.|$|E
5|$|An {{extended}} {{version of the}} film, including altered special effects, was released on March 22, 2002. Certain shots of E.T. had bothered Spielberg since 1982, as {{he did not have}} enough time to perfect the <b>animatronics.</b> Computer-generated imagery (CGI), provided by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), was used to modify several shots, including ones of E.T. running in the opening sequence and being spotted in the cornfield. The spaceship's design was also altered to include more lights. Scenes shot for but not included in the original version were introduced. These included E.T. taking a bath, and Gertie telling Mary that Elliott went to the forest on Halloween. Spielberg did not add the scene featuring Harrison Ford, feeling that would reshape the film too drastically. He became more sensitive about the scene where gun-wielding federal agents confront Elliott and his escaping friends and had them digitally replaced with walkie-talkies.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{originally}} planned to create {{many of the}} aliens with computer graphics, but those {{that would be more}} cost-effectively realized with masks and <b>animatronics</b> were created by Nick Dudman's creature effects team. These included the Neimodians, background characters in Mos Espa, the Jedi Council, and the Galactic Senate. Dudman's team was told where the creatures would be required six months before principal photography begun, and they rushed the production. The Neimodian suits, which were originally intended as digital characters, were delivered one day before they would be required on set. Dudman traveled to Skywalker Ranch to see the original creatures that could be reused, and read the script for a breakdown of scenes with practical creatures, leaving only the more outlandish designs to be created using CGI.|$|E
5|$|The main {{characters}} in the Five Nights at Freddy's series are generally security guards working at a Freddy Fazbear's Pizza or related location. None of them have distinct personalities {{and most of the}} gameplay takes place from their point of view. In Five Nights at Freddy's, the guard's name is Mike Schmidt. In Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the guard is named Jeremy Fitzgerald for all of the main five nights and the bonus sixth night, though he is replaced in the custom seventh night by another guard, Fritz Smith. The security guard for Fazbear's Fright: The Horror Attraction in Five Nights at Freddy's 3, is unknown. The main character of Five Nights at Freddy's 4 is an unnamed boy, who experiences nightmares of the <b>animatronics.</b> The player in Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location is a technician who has their name jokingly autocorrected to Eggs Benedict. The technician's name is assumed, although not confirmed to be, Mike.|$|E
5|$|After {{directing}} The Search for Spock, {{cast member}} Leonard Nimoy {{was asked to}} direct the next feature, and given greater freedom regarding the film's content. Nimoy and producer Harve Bennett conceived a story with an environmental message and no clear-cut villain. Dissatisfied with the first screenplay produced by Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes, Paramount hired The Wrath of Khan writer and director Nicholas Meyer. Meyer and Bennett divided the story between them and wrote {{different parts of the}} script, requiring approval from Nimoy, lead actor William Shatner, and Paramount. Principal photography commenced on February 24, 1986. Unlike previous Star Trek films, The Voyage Home was shot extensively on location; many real settings and buildings were used as stand-ins for scenes set around and in the city of San Francisco. Special effects firm Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) assisted in post-production and the film's special effects. Few of the humpback whales in the film were real: ILM devised full-size <b>animatronics</b> and small motorized models to stand in for the real creatures.|$|E
25|$|The film {{industry}} has been a driving force revolutionizing the technology used to develop <b>animatronics.</b>|$|E
25|$|While functional, early clocks {{were also}} {{designed}} as novelties and spectacles which integrated features of early <b>animatronics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Directors such as Steven Spielberg and Jim Henson {{have been}} pioneers in using <b>animatronics</b> {{in the film}} industry.|$|E
25|$|Disney has a {{research}} team devoted to improving and developing better methods of creating more lifelike <b>animatronics</b> exteriors with silicone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Animatronics</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} as a career which combines the disciplines of mechanical engineering, casting/sculpting, control technologies, electrical/electronic systems, radio control and airbrushing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Animatronics</b> {{are used}} in {{situations}} where a creature does not exist, the action is too risky or costly to use real actors or animals, or the action could never be obtained with a living person or animal. Its main advantage over CGI and stop motion is that the simulated creature has a physical presence moving {{in front of the}} camera in real time. The technology behind <b>animatronics</b> has become more advanced and sophisticated over the years, making the puppets even more lifelike.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} animals are {{featured}} in Apocalypto, including a Baird's tapir and a black jaguar. <b>Animatronics</b> or puppets were employed for the scenes injurious to animals.|$|E
25|$|The Kadiwa Park {{located on}} Congressional Road {{is a large}} park {{featuring}} sculptures and <b>animatronics</b> of animals and dinosaurs attracts tourists from nearby towns and provinces.|$|E
25|$|Coelophysis also {{appeared}} in the first episode of the BBC series Walking with Dinosaurs, where they, along with other extinct species, were recreated using CGI animation and <b>animatronics.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Walt Disney Production company {{started using}} <b>animatronics</b> in 1955 for Disneyland's ride, the Jungle Cruise, and later for its {{attraction}} Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room which featured animatronic Enchanted Tiki Birds.|$|E
25|$|Hoping to {{give the}} {{destroyed}} Bishop a more complex look {{that could not be}} done by simple make-up, the final product was done entirely through <b>animatronics,</b> while a playback of Lance Henriksen's voice played to guide Sigourney Weaver.|$|E
25|$|The {{director}} had to {{work around}} the budget-imposed restrictions, especially {{when it came to}} special effects. The creature was designed by Chin Wei-chen, the modeling was done by New Zealand-based Weta Workshop and the <b>animatronics</b> were by John Cox's creature Workshop.|$|E
25|$|To date, Sawhney {{has scored}} over fifty films {{as well as}} many {{international}} TV programmes, ads and cinema trailers. Signed to LA based agency, First Artist Management, Sawhney has written music {{for a wide variety of}} contexts, from dark, high-tension drama to light hearted <b>animatronics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Walt Disney {{is often}} {{credited}} for popularizing <b>animatronics</b> for entertainment after he bought an animatronic bird {{while he was}} vacationing, although it is disputed whether it was in New Orleans or Europe. Disney's vision for audio-animatronics was primarily focused on patriotic displays rather than amusements.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the Upper Lot {{contains}} a French themed avenue with quick service dining, and {{a replica of}} Mel's Diner, known for being featured prominently in the Universal classic American Graffiti. Recently opened, a Walking Dead themed attraction that mixes <b>animatronics</b> with real actors.|$|E
25|$|The player, {{who sits}} in an office, is {{given access to}} a network of {{security}} cameras throughout the facility to track {{the movement of the}} <b>animatronics.</b> Each character roams the restaurant and has distinct movement patterns, and most of the characters' movements take place off-screen. The camera feeds are dimly lit and distorted, one of the rooms only contains an audio feed, and the cameras do not cover certain areas of the building, most notably the two hallways directly to the left and right of the player. The player cannot leave the guard room, but can close the doors to defend themselves, and briefly turn on lights in the hallways to check for <b>animatronics.</b> Use of these actions consume the player's limited electrical power; if the power runs out, the cameras become inoperable, the doors open, and the lights go out. Once these things happen, the Toreador March will play, the screen will go pitch black, and the player will be jumpscared by Freddy, provided they do not reach {{the end of the night}} in the meantime. If the player is jumpscared by any of the <b>animatronics,</b> the game ends, and the player must restart from the beginning of the night.|$|E
25|$|Although {{marketed as}} a family film, it was notably darker than the creators' {{previous}} material, and incorporated several nods to the new age movement. The <b>animatronics</b> used in the film were considered groundbreaking. The primary concept artist was the fantasy illustrator Brian Froud, famous for his distinctive fairy and dwarf designs. Froud also collaborated with Henson and Oz for their next project, the 1986 film Labyrinth.|$|E
25|$|Construction for Disney's Animal Kingdom {{began in}} 1990, {{a year after}} the opening of the Disney MGM Studios. To create the theme park Disney Imagineers {{traveled}} to Africa and Asia to study the landscapes and wildlife and installed large numbers of plants once the exhibits were built, holding areas were confined and the park's animals were bought in. Some others were donated and different dark rides and <b>animatronics</b> were engineered.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2005, it was {{announced}} that the musical would be going on a UK tour in April 2006. The live show was taken to Australia and New Zealand and returned the UK during December 2007. The show, produced by Damian Collier, used a ten-piece band and a 48-piece string orchestra, voice actors, screen-projected images and <b>animatronics.</b> Universal Pictures released a DVD of the show, filmed at Wembley Arena using 23 high definition cameras and directed by David Mallet.|$|E
25|$|<b>Animatronics</b> is a multi-disciplinary field which {{integrates}} anatomy, robots, mechatronics, and puppetry {{resulting in}} lifelike animation. Animatronic figures are often powered by pneumatics, hydraulics, and/or by electrical means, {{and can be}} implemented using both computer control and human control, including teleoperation. Motion actuators are often used to imitate muscle movements and create realistic motions in limbs. Figures are covered with body shells and flexible skins made of hard and soft plastic materials and finished with details like colors, hair and feathers and other components to make the figure more life like.|$|E
25|$|Weta Workshop head Richard Taylor cited Hieronymus Bosch's The Garden of Earthly Delights as an {{inspiration}} on the film. He felt Narnia {{had to be}} less dark and gritty than their depiction of Middle-earth in The Lord of the Rings {{because it is a}} new world. Many of Weta's creature designs were designed for digital creation, so when Howard Berger and KNB FX inherited the practical effects work, they had to spend three months retooling approved designs for <b>animatronics.</b> Berger's children would comment and advise upon his designs; they suggested the White Witch's hair be changed from black to blonde, which Berger concurred with as he realized Swinton's wig looked too Gothic.|$|E
25|$|The story {{takes place}} in Spain in May–June 1944, {{five years after the}} Spanish Civil War, during the early Francoist period. The {{narrative}} intertwines this real world with a mythical world centered on an overgrown abandoned labyrinth and a mysterious faun creature, with whom the main character, Ofelia, interacts. Ofelia's stepfather, the Falangist Captain Vidal, hunts the Spanish Maquis who fight against the Francoist regime in the region, while Ofelia's pregnant mother Carmen grows increasingly ill. Ofelia meets several strange and magical creatures who become central to her story, leading her through the trials of the old labyrinth garden. The film employs make-up, <b>animatronics,</b> and CGI effects to bring life to its creatures.|$|E
25|$|The Alien {{is portrayed}} by both Woodruff, Jr. {{in a suit}} and a rod puppet filmed against bluescreen and {{optically}} composited into the live-action footage, with the rods removed by rotoscoping. A mechanical alien head was also used for close-ups. The suit adapted the design used in Aliens so Woodruff could walk on all fours. Woodruff's head was contained in the neck of the suit, because the head was filled with <b>animatronics</b> to move the mouth of the Alien. Fincher suggested that a Whippet be dressed in an alien costume for on-set coverage of the quadrupedal alien, but the visual effects team was dissatisfied with the comical result and the idea was dropped in favor of the puppet.|$|E
