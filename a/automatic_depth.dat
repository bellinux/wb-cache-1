In PPT, amplitude and phase delay signatures are available following data acquisition (carried out {{in a similar way}} as in classical Pulsed Thermography), by applying a transformation algorithm such as the Fourier Transform (FT) on thermal profiles. The authors have recently presented an extended review on PPT theory, including a new inversion technique for depth retrieval by correlating the depth with the blind frequency fb (frequency at which a defect produce enough phase contrast to be detected). An <b>automatic</b> defect <b>depth</b> retrieval algorithm had also been proposed, evidencing PPT capabilities as a practical inversion technique.

Least squares regression results show excellent agreement between depth and the inverse square root blind frequency, which can be used for depth inversion. Experimental results on steel plates with simulated corrosion are presented as well.

5000|$|Harry Ferguson {{patented}} the three-point linkage {{for agricultural}} tractors in Britain in 1926. He {{had long been}} a champion {{of the importance of}} rigid attachment of the plough to the tractor. The idea did not originate with him, but he led its popularization over many years of development, explaining, and selling. During the decade of 1916 to 1926 he developed his ideas through various iterations, duplex and triplex, mechanical and hydraulic, to arrive at the patented form. During the next decade, he continued explaining and selling his hitches and implements and even produced his own model of tractor (contract-manufactured by David Brown Ltd.). The particular geometry of the linkage that attached the plough to the tractor enabled forces generated by the plough to be applied to the rear wheels of the tractor. This redirected the plough's resistance into downward force on the drive wheels, which enabled Ferguson's tractor to be much lighter and more manoeuvrable than earlier models of farm tractor with equivalent tractive force and traction. As a result his tractor could operate on soft ground and caused less compacting damage to the soil in comparison with other tractors of the time, and it could produce given amounts of work with less time and fuel. The hydraulically operated and controlled three-point hitch used the draft of the mounted tool to moderate the depth of the tool and therefore the load on the tractor (<b>automatic</b> <b>depth</b> control or draft control). In addition, the three-point hitch would prevent the tractor from flipping backwards on the drive wheels if the implement being dragged were to hit a rock or other immovable obstruction. Ferguson and his colleagues developed several innovations to this device (e.g., the hydraulic lift and depth control) which made the system workable, effective, and desirable. In 1938, after almost two decades of trying to sell Henry Ford on using Ferguson's system on tractors mass-produced by Ford, Ferguson finally convinced Ford. The American mass-market debut was via the Ford-Ferguson 9N in 1939.|$|E

Hence, the spatial and temporal variability of the snow cover is significantly modified with respective consequences on the total amount of water in the snow pack, on the temporal dynamics of the runoff and on the energy balance of the surface. For the presented study we used the snow transport model SnowTran- 3 D in combination with MM 5 (Penn State University – National Center for Atmospheric Research MM 5 model) generated wind fields. In a first step the MM 5 wind fields were downscaled by using a semi-empirical approach which accounts for the elevation difference of model and real topography, as well as aspect, inclination and vegetation. The target resolution of 30 m corresponds to the resolution of the best available DEM and land cover map.

40|$|Delayed Hydride Cracking (DHC) is a {{crack growth}} {{mechanism}} {{that occurs in}} zirconium alloys, including the pressure tubes of CANDU reactors. DHC is caused by hydrogen in solution in zirconium components being diffused to any flaws present, resulting in an increased concentration of hydrogen within these flaws. An increased hydrogen concentration can lead to brittleness, followed by cracking, in high-stress regions of a pressure tube. Regular in-service ultrasonic inspection of CANDU pressure tubes aim to locate and classify any flaws that pose a potential for DHC initiation. A common approach to inspection {{is the use of}} a bespoke tool containing multiple ultrasonic transducers to ensure that each point on the pressure tube is inspected from a minimum of three angles during a scan. All flaws from within the inspected pressure tubes must be characterized prior to restarting the reactor, thus the time-consuming analysis process lies on the critical outage path. This process is manually intensive and often requires a significant amount of expert knowledge. A modular system to automatically process outage data to provide decision support to analysts has been developed. This system saves time on the critical outage path while providing repeatable and explicable measurements. Part of the analysis process requires the depth of all flaws to be measured, which is often the most time consuming stage of the analysis process.

40|$|Shallow slurry {{injection}} {{is considered}} to be {{the most efficient way to}} reduce the ammonia emission by agriculture, but its performance is highly dependent on the injection <b>depth.</b> An <b>automatic</b> electro-hydraulic <b>depth</b> control system was developed to maintain the injection depth within narrow margins around the desired value. it utilised the hydraulic system of the four-point linkage of the slurry tanker to change the position of the injector with respect to the tanker in order to minimise the difference between the desired height of the supporting frame of the injector and the height measured by means of an ultrasonic sensor. Based on a grey-box model, the performance of different control algorithms was compared by simulation with this model. Although the bandwidth of the system with a lead compensator was slightly larger than with a proportional controller for a linearised model structure, the performance of both controllers was comparable when actuator saturation was taken into account. Because of its simplicity, the proportional controller was implemented. Comparison of the performance of the depth control system with the commercially available pressure control system on two fields with a high and a low soil penetration resistance showed that the depth control system outperforms the pressure control system in terms of overall mean error (51 - 78 % more accurate) and standard deviation (16 - 44 % less variation) for all parallel runs.

40|$|Injection depth has an {{important}} impact {{on the performance of}} a shallow manure injection system. Therefore, it should be maintained within narrow margins. For this purpose, an <b>automatic</b> electro-hydraulic <b>depth</b> control system was developed, which minimises the difference between the actual injection, measured by means of an ultrasonic sensor, and the desired injection depth. To minimise this difference the relative position of the shallow slurry injector attached to the four-point linkage at the back of a manure tanker was changed with respect to this tanker. A grey box model was developed for the conversion of the voltage applied to an electronic control unit into the working depth of a shallow manure injector. A simplified and linearised model based on theoretical considerations was developed. The parameters of this model were estimated by means of frequency-domain identification techniques. This model contained all the dominant dynamics of the system that are relevant for control design. Since the dynamics of the system change during manure application, the worst case with respect to the stability of the depth control system was sought by comparing several extreme situations. The case of an empty tanker with the injector above the ground (minimal soil penetration resistance) was found to be the worst case and the model parameters were determined for this case. The resulting model contains an integrator and is of second order in the numerator, and fourth order in the denominator. Along with the non-linear time delay effect this model was found to be suitable for a model-based design of a stable and accurate injection depth controller. status: publishe...|$|R
