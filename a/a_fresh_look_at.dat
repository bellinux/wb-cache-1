5|$|<b>A</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{this concept}} started at ARPA around 1963–64 {{under the name}} Hardpoint. This led to the {{construction}} of the Hardpoint Demonstration Array Radar, and an even faster missile concept known as HIBEX. This proved interesting enough for the Army and Air Force to collaborate on a follow-up study, Hardsite. The first Hardsite concept, HSD-I, considered defending bases within urban areas that would have Nike-X protection anyway. An example might be a SAC command and control center or an airfield on the outskirts of a city. The second study, HSD-II, considered the protection of isolated bases like missile fields. Most follow-up work focused on the HSD-II concept.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer brought John von Neumann to Los Alamos in September 1943 to take <b>a</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> implosion. After {{reviewing}} Neddermeyer's studies, {{and discussing}} {{the matter with}} Edward Teller, von Neumann suggested the use of high explosives in shaped charges to implode a sphere, which he showed could not only result in a faster assembly of fissile material than was possible with the gun method, but which could greatly {{reduce the amount of}} material required, because of the resulting higher density. The idea that, under such pressures, the plutonium metal itself would be compressed came from Teller, whose knowledge of how dense metals behaved under heavy pressure was influenced by his pre-war theoretical studies of the Earth's core with George Gamow. The prospect of more-efficient nuclear weapons impressed Oppenheimer, Teller, and Hans Bethe, but they decided that an expert on explosives would be required. Kistiakowsky's name was immediately suggested, and Kistiakowsky was brought into the project as a consultant in October 1943.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{exception}} of A New Morning, Dog Man Star was Suede's least commercially successful album from before they split up, yet It is widely considered by many critics as Suede's masterpiece. Although the album remained a favourite among critics, appearing in many best of lists throughout the 1990s, it was often designated as a 'lost classic'. Following Suede's disbandment in 2003 some critics recognised this while writing about the album in the years during the band's hiatus.

[...] In a 2006 retrospective review, Michael Furman of Tiny Mix Tapes, while comparing Suede to Radiohead, Oasis and Manic Street Preachers, all bands who released popular records around this time, said: [...] "It is Suede's Dog Man Star, however, that often slips through the recollections of this period."

40|$|The {{paper is}} an attempt to answer the {{fundamental}} question whether there is any rationale behind studying Roman law for the sake of modern science and the teaching of law. In {{the first part of the}} paper, the possibility of rejecting reading Roman law as being useless from the point of view of contemporary jurisprudence is considered. It is also proposed that the current state of affairs is the result of implementation in legal history studies of R. Zimmermann’s vision that Roman law and comparative law are two useful instruments for harmonising private law. Further, a claim is made that the outcome of the discussions on the harmonisation of private law, the so-called Common Frame of Reference has been developed with no references to the accomplishments of legal history. This innovative and modern approach is then discussed and a question is asked whether it would be possible and expedient to take <b>a</b> <b>fresher</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Roman law, and propose a more realistic element to jurisprudence, rejecting, at the same time, the dogmatic method, and focus, instead, on the reflection on the essence and merit of law, and the relationship between law and the environment in which it is applied. This, in the author’s opinion, should serve to make the study of Roman law more independent in relation to the current doctrine of private law. The author then concludes that Roman law may be useful for the construction of private law but only on condition that it is not reduced to an ideological banner supporting the myth of a united Europe, as the true usefulness of Roman law should be the identification of universal elements and provision of arguments to challenge the currently adopted dogmatic vision of private law...|$|R
