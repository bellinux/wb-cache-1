5|$|Frank's Cock is a 1993 Canadian {{short film}} written and {{directed}} by Mike Hoolboom. The eight-minute production stars Callum Keith Rennie as an unnamed narrator who discusses his relationship with his partner, Frank. The two met while the narrator was a teenager and spent nearly ten years together. Frank has since been diagnosed with AIDS, and the narrator fears his death. The story was based on the experience of one of Hoolboom's friends at People With AIDS, which Hoolboom adapted after receiving a commission to create a short film <b>about</b> <b>breaking</b> up.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 4 June, the Intelligence Officer for the 6th Marines, Lieutenant William A. Eddy, and two men stole through German lines to gather {{information}} about German forces. They gathered valuable information showing the Germans were consolidating machine gun positions and bringing in artillery. While this activity indicated an attack was not immediately likely, their increasing strength was creating a base of attack that raised concern <b>about</b> <b>breaking</b> through to Paris.|$|E
25|$|Those {{associated}} with a recent death are seen as imbued {{with a kind of}} contagion {{for a short period of}} time. When bilo or salamanga healing rituals are being conducted, the ombiasy may erect a special barrier (kiady) in front of the entrance to the house where the ceremony is being held as an indicator that anyone whose family member has recently died (as well as any foreigner or stranger outside the community) is forbidden to enter for concern <b>about</b> <b>breaking</b> the power of the healing spell.|$|E

25|$|Later, Holopainen confessed that, at that time, he seriously started {{thinking}} <b>about</b> <b>breaking</b> Nightwish up. After a gig in Russia, {{he sent a}} text message to fellow musician Tony Kakko of metal band Sonata Arctica, telling him {{that he did not}} think he had a band any longer, and asking him what plans he had for next year. After Nightwish's last gig for the Over the Hills and Far Away tour in 2001, Holopainen called their labels Drakkar and Spinefarm, unofficially declaring Nightwish was over. He told them he might produce another album, but he'd never perform another show with the band. The same message was also written on the band's message board.|$|E
500|$|Once the Nannygate matter {{broke into}} the news, the {{question}} [...] "Do you have a Zoë Baird problem?" [...] became frequently asked by Americans {{of each other in}} casual conversation, with many answers being in the affirmative. [...] U.S. Census Bureau and Internal Revenue Service data indicated that only one-quarter of people who employed household help paid Social Security taxes to the workers, and that even figure may have been higher than the real one due to people not responding to surveys honestly. [...] Most of those doing the hiring did not think <b>about</b> <b>breaking</b> the law or getting caught.|$|E
500|$|... "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer Lady Gaga, {{from her}} debut album, The Fame (2008). It was {{released}} as the third single in Australia, New Zealand and selected European countries, and the fourth single in France. The song is a calypso-styled, mid-tempo ballad, and is <b>about</b> <b>breaking</b> up with one's old partner and finding someone new. Although [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] was never released as a single in her home country, it received mostly negative reviews from US-based critics, who denoted it as [...] "dry and lifeless", blaming it for halting the [...] "bad-girl party atmosphere" [...] of The Fame.|$|E

500|$|... "Poker Face" [...] was {{inspired}} by Gaga's boyfriends who enjoyed gambling, and also dealt with her personal experience of bisexuality; her fantasies about women while having sex with men, thus representing her 'poker face'." [...] "Boys, Boys, Boys" [...] {{was inspired}} by the similarly titled Mötley Crüe song [...] "Girls, Girls, Girls". Gaga explained that she wanted a female version of the song that rockers would like too. [...] "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich" [...] summed up her time of self-discovery, living in the Lower East Side and dabbling in drugs and the party scene. [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] was <b>about</b> <b>breaking</b> up with a boyfriend and finding someone new. [...] "Brown Eyes" [...] {{was inspired by}} the British rock band Queen and, according to Gaga, is the most vulnerable song on the album.|$|E
500|$|Services {{for state}} parks stopped, {{including}} roads, making them mostly {{accessible only by}} foot, and causing a number of problems. An official for the Department of Natural Resources told the Pioneer Press that visitors were relieving themselves on trails in Gooseberry Falls State Park, as the restrooms were closed, and that uncollected garbage attracted bears in Crow Wing State Park. Vandalism occurred at Afton State Park, where the main office was [...] "ransacked" [...] {{and a group of}} twelve [...] "ripped off shingles and pieces of deck for firewood, burned additional furniture and wrote messages bragging <b>about</b> <b>breaking</b> in for free". While many state-run attractions were closed during the shutdown, institutions not part of the state government stayed open. Museums such as the Science Museum of Minnesota reported an increase in visits, as did county parks and attractions in neighboring states.|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from being}} Carey's second highest {{worldwide}} seller, Daydream served as her most personal and directly influenced album at the time. During the album's recording, Carey grew as an artist, {{as well as}} a writer. For {{the first time in her}} career, Carey was able to make music that she truly related to, R and hip hop. While Columbia allowed Carey more leniency with the music she recorded, they became hesitant when she featured Ol' Dirty Bastard in the remix for [...] "Fantasy". They feared the sudden change was completely left field for her music, and worried it would jeopardize the album's success. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Carey openly spoke of her issues with Columbia: [...] "Everybody was like 'What, are you crazy?' They're nervous <b>about</b> <b>breaking</b> the formula. It works to have me sing a ballad on stage in a long dress with my hair up." ...|$|E

500|$|The songs {{featured}} in the episode from the actual Sweeney Todd musical are [...] "The Ballad of Sweeney Todd", [...] "Johanna", and [...] "By the Sea". Erin accidentally references The Baby-Sitters Club, a series of novels by Ann M. Martin, when talking <b>about</b> <b>breaking</b> into the babysitting business in Scranton. Michael brings balloons to the musical, Phyllis notes that they remind her of the 2009 Pixar film Up. Jim mentions that trying to put CeCe to sleep reminds him of the 2008 war film The Hurt Locker. The ending scene features Michael auditioning for the musical by re-acting an entire episode of the American police procedural and legal drama television series Law & Order, complete with opening monologue, theme music, and the show's notable [...] "Clang" [...] sound effect.

500|$|Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna {{felt that the}} lyrics, along with being an answer-song, could also be {{interpreted}} as a rebellious one, where Madonna looks back on a relationship where she was not allowed to speak her mind. The song's lyrics contain sarcastic backing vocals with Madonna asking rhetorical questions based on her real-life actions, such as [...] "Did I say something wrong? Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex. I must have been crazy," [...] as well as the line [...] "What was I thinking?" [...] Madonna explained that the lyrics were about [...] "basically saying don't put me in a box, don't pin me down, don't tell me what I can and can't say.

500|$|... "Day 'n' Nite" [...] is the album's turning point, {{where it}} {{transitions}} from the drab theme of loneliness to vitality. Among the brighter songs are [...] "Enter Galactic (LoveConnection Part 1)", a [...] "trippy disco anthem" [...] that {{is inspired by}} when he and a female friend ate shrooms and listened to music by The Postal Service together. [...] "Make Her Say" [...] includes a sample of pop singers Lady Gaga's 2009 smash hit [...] "Poker Face" [...] and features verses from West and Common. It takes Gaga's naughty, mischievous central hook and turns it around to be an unrefined oral sex reference {{that makes it a}} [...] "hyper-catchy, forward-looking single." [...] He channels André 3000 in [...] "Cudi Zone". Man on the Moon: The End of Days closer is [...] "Up Up and Away", an escapist drug anthem single. Unlike other music's common theme of drugs being used as an escape from the unpleasant realities, this however, is <b>about</b> <b>breaking</b> free from the rough reality of someone's own mind and heart.|$|E

40|$|We {{provide an}} {{approach}} to forecasting the long-run (unconditional) distribution of equity returns making optimal use of historical data {{in the presence of}} structural breaks. Our focus is on learning <b>about</b> <b>breaks</b> in real time and assessing their impact on out-of-sample density forecasts. Forecasts use a probability-weighted average of submodels, each of which is estimated over a different history of data. The paper illustrates the importance of uncertainty <b>about</b> structural <b>breaks</b> and the value of modeling higher-order moments of excess returns when forecasting the return distribution and its moments. The shape of the long-run distribution and the dynamics of the higher-order moments are quite different from those generated by forecasts which cannot capture structural breaks. The empirical results strongly reject ignoring structural change in favor of our forecasts which weight historical data to accommodate uncertainty <b>about</b> structural <b>breaks.</b> We also strongly reject the common practice of using a fixed-length moving window. These differences in long-run forecasts have implications for many financial decisions, particularly for risk management and long-run investment decisions. density forecasts, structural change, model risk, parameter uncertainty, Bayesian learning, market returns...|$|R
500|$|Several {{months after}} the deaths of his {{colleague}} Sgt. James Doakes and his Narcotics Anonymous sponsor Lila Tournay (Jaime Murray), Dexter's life has returned to normal. He looks up a drug dealer, Fred [...] "Freebo" [...] Bowman (Mike Erwin), whom he believes to have killed two female college students. Pretending to want to buy heroin, Dexter visits Freebo's house, where he sees Freebo's girlfriend Teegan Campbell (Jelly Howie). He returns to the house at night and finds Freebo fighting with another man (Nick Hermz). When the man attacks Dexter, Dexter stabs and kills him in self-defense. Dexter flees, shocked <b>about</b> <b>breaking</b> his father Harry's [...] "code" [...] and killing an innocent person. He is called to the scene the following day and discovers {{that the man was}} Oscar Prado, the brother of well-known assistant district attorney Miguel Prado. Miguel seeks an explanation and consolation from Dexter, and invites him to Oscar's wake. Dexter attends, leaving Debra alone on their dead father's birthday. He begins to question Harry's code and whether his loyalty is necessary.|$|E
500|$|Speaking of the song's lyrical background, Cruz told Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul: [...] "Its <b>about</b> <b>breaking</b> a girl's heart, {{but in a}} way that's kinda not on purpose. It's {{more that}} I'm just a single guy, trying to be single and trying to remain single. And sometimes, when you are in that place, you get girls who wanna be a part of what you're about – but, because you're not really ready for a relationship, those girls can end up being heartbroken. So what I'm {{basically}} saying is 'I might just break your heart. But I'm only gonna break your heart if you come through this way right now'." [...] Cruz also has called his song [...] "catchy" [...] with a [...] "good melody" [...] and [...] "fun topic", stating that [...] "both girls and guys can get into this character". In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Cruz elaborated and said the song was partially based on a personal situation, and rather an [...] "exaggeration of an experience".|$|E
500|$|While Koiwai works, Yotsuba plays {{house with}} her wooden blocks, then talks her father into a game of hide and seek and playing on the swings in the park. Inspired by a picture book, Yotsuba learns how to cook pancakes from her father, with {{assistance}} from Yanda. That evening, the Koiwais show Jumbo photographs from the hot air balloon festival. While her father finishes an assignment, Jumbo babysits Yotsuba and gives her a book about animals. The next day, Jumbo takes the Koiwais shopping for a digital camera. While the adults compare cameras, Yotsuba explores the electronics store with Fuka. When Yotsuba lies <b>about</b> <b>breaking</b> some dishes, Koiwai takes her to a guardian Niō statue at a Buddhist temple to scare the [...] "lying bug" [...] out of her.

500|$|... "Liberty Walk" [...] {{was written}} by Cyrus, Nicholas J. Scapa, John Read Fasse, Michael McGinnis, Antonina Armato and Tim James. It was {{produced}} by the latter three under their stage name Rock Mafia. The song serves as the opening track of Can't Be Tamed (2010). In an interview with Sway Calloway for MTV News, Cyrus explained the lyrical inspiration of the song which is about female empowerment, saying: [...] "It's just about freeing yourself from anything you think is holding you back. And I think that's really important, especially for girls, {{because so many people}} are told, 'No, you can't do something,' or, 'You need to be this because Mom and Dad say that, teachers say this.'" [...] Upon the making of the song, Cyrus stated in the same interview that she tried to combine a serious topic with a lighter sound, explaining: [...] "I wrote it for women that feel like they're stuck in abusive relationships, but it's a dance song". She elaborated: [...] "So you think that must be kind of a sad ballad, but it's a party song. ... It's <b>about</b> <b>breaking</b> free." ...|$|E
500|$|After publication, Juster sent {{a copy of}} {{the book}} to the Ford Foundation, with an {{explanation}} of how the projected book on cities had transformed into The Phantom Tollbooth. He never heard back from them, and learned years later that they were delighted by the turn of events. With the book having become an unexpected hit, Juster found himself answering letters from young readers, and a few parents. He found that children understood the wordplay at different ages, and heard from the occasional college student as well. Some students wrote a second time after a gap of years [...] "and they'll talk to me about a whole different book, normally. But now they've got a lot more of the words right. A lot more of the fun kind of crazy references". He learned too that readers were capable of more than he had intended, {{as in the case of}} the letter sent by the Mathemagician to King Azaz. Composed entirely of numbers, some readers assumed it was a code and set <b>about</b> <b>breaking</b> it, only to appeal to Juster for help when they were not successful. The numbers were not intended to have any meaning, and were meant to convey that the Mathemagician's letter could not have been understood by Azaz or his advisers.|$|E
