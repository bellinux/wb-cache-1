5|$|After {{the story}} is printed, the {{neighborhood}} learns of Mac's past, and members of a local country–western band visit him to show their respect. Although he greets them politely, Mac remains reluctant to open up about his past. Later, he secretly attends Dixie's concert. She passionately sings several songs that Mac wrote years earlier, and he leaves {{in the middle of}} the performance. Backstage, he talks to Dixie's manager, his old friend Harry (Wilford Brimley). Mac gives him <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new song he has written and asks him to show it to Dixie. Mac tries to talk to Dixie, but she becomes angry upon seeing him and warns him to stay away from their 18-year-old daughter, Sue Anne (Ellen Barkin).|$|E
5|$|At a {{literary}} salon in January 1909, Pound met the novelist Olivia Shakespear {{and her daughter}} Dorothy, who became his wife in 1914. Through Olivia Shakespear he was introduced to her former lover W. B. Yeats, in Pound's view the greatest living poet. Pound had sent Yeats <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> Lume Spento the previous year, {{before he left for}} Venice, and Yeats had apparently found it charming. The men became close friends, although Yeats was older by 20 years.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Queen Mary asked Garrard & Co. to make <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tiara {{owned by}} her grandmother, Princess Augusta of Hesse-Cassel, using the queen's own {{diamonds}} and pearls. French in its neo-classical design, the tiara has 19 oriental pearls suspended from lover's knot bows each centred {{with a large}} brilliant. Mary left the tiara to Elizabeth II, who later gave it to Diana, Princess of Wales, as a wedding present. She wore it often, notably with her 'Elvis dress' {{on a visit to}} Hong Kong in 1989, but on her divorce from Prince Charles it was returned to the Queen. In 2015 and 2016, the Duchess of Cambridge wore it to a diplomatic reception at Buckingham Palace.|$|E

5|$|Modern historians, however, {{doubt the}} {{veracity}} of this theory. For one thing, notes Kenneth R.

5|$|Though Green was {{caring for}} Farrar {{in the family}} home while he {{recovered}} from his repeated bouts of illness, she was also continuing to drink heavily and, increasingly often, claiming to be contemplating suicide or to want Margaret Hacker dead. In late September, Farrar searched the house and her belongings. In her purse, he discovered seed packets labeled as castor beans, <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> supposedly-anonymous letter that {{had been sent to}} Farrar urging him to not divorce Green, and empty vials of potassium chloride.

5|$|While Sanger was in Europe, {{her husband}} {{continued}} her work, {{which led to}} his arrest after he distributed <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> birth control pamphlet to an undercover postal worker. The arrest and his 30-day jail sentence prompted several mainstream publications, including Harper's Weekly and the New-York Tribune, to publish articles about the birth control controversy. Emma Goldman and Ben Reitman toured the country, speaking {{in support of the}} Sangers, and distributing copies of Sanger's pamphlet Family Limitation. Sanger's exile and her husband's arrest propelled the birth control movement into the forefront of American news.|$|E

5|$|White Plume Mountain {{is set in}} the World of Greyhawk, a {{campaign}} setting for Dungeons & Dragons. The module is a dungeon crawl, precipitated by the theft of three magical, sentient weapons: a trident named Wave, a war hammer named Whelm, and a sword named Blackrazor (all three were introduced in this adventure). The weapons' former owners each received <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> taunting poem, instructing them that the weapons are located in White Plume Mountain. The poem is signed by the wizard Keraptis, who thirteen hundred years ago descended into the volcanic mountain with a company of gnomes and disappeared. The player characters goal is to follow the same path and retrieve the weapons from Keraptis' lair.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of men were hired for the building's construction, and local workers were chosen over non-locals. During the construction, many of the workers lived in tents beside their worksite, and cooked meals and stayed there when not working. The {{cornerstone}} was laid on June 15, 1888; beneath it was laid several bottles of wine, <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> St. Helena Star and San Francisco newspapers, and foreign and rare coins. The building, called the Bourn & Wise Wine Cellar, was completed around June 1889, along with a distillery north {{of the building and}} a superintendent's house to the south. In September of that year Everett Wise became too ill to work and sold his share in the winery to Bourn, who between that time and 1890 named the winery Greystone Cellars.|$|E
5|$|Basset {{probably}} died in 1127, and {{was certainly}} dead in 1130. He {{is said to}} have taken ill at Northampton, and to have been clothed in a monk's habit while on his deathbed. He was buried in the chapterhouse at Abingdon Abbey, which he left a bequest to. <b>A</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> charter from Archbishop Theobald of Bec, recorded in a cartulary, records most of Basset's manors. While most of the estates seem to have been held by Basset as a sub-tenant, four of the estates appear to have been held as a tenant-in-chief. These estates were not very valuable, and Basset can not be considered a baron, although his son Richard managed through marriage to {{become a member of the}} barons. He held lands in nine counties, perhaps centred in Berkshire.|$|E

5|$|Kalākaua {{met with}} the Viceroy on March 31 to propose the {{emigration}} of unmarried Chinese women, as well as Chinese family units to Hawaii, to counterbalance the labor population of unmarried Chinese men. The Viceroy responded favorably and agreed to co-sponsor such an emigration with the Hawaiian government. Li arranged several events to provide Kalākaua {{the opportunity to meet}} the city's influential persons. <b>A</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> draft of a proposed treaty was forwarded to Hawaii's Minister of Foreign Affairs Green. The Hong Kong Daily News held a positive view of Hawaii's treatment of existing Chinese laborers, but stated that the Chinese government needed to provide financial assistance for family emigration to Hawaii. The royal party returned to Shanghai on April 6. A proposed trip to Beijing was aborted when Empress Dowager Ci'an died on April 8. They sailed out of China the next day.|$|E
5|$|The main {{documentary}} {{source for}} the kings of the Crovan dynasty is the Chronicle of Mann, the only contemporary indigenous narrative-source concerning these men. The source itself survives {{in the form of}} a fourteenth-century Latin manuscript, which is in turn <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chronicle probably first commissioned and composed during the reign of Magnús Óláfsson, King of Mann and the Isles (died 1265). About fifteen percent of the chronicle is devoted to the strife between the half-brothers, and much of the rest of this source deals with the after-effects of the conflict. Although the chronicle's account of the half-brothers' struggle appears to be somewhat neutral, its treatment of their descendants is clearly slanted in favour of Óláfr's sons. In fact, it was only during the reign of Óláfr's son Magnús, that the former's sons finally overcame Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson's descendants once and for all. The chronicle, therefore, may have been composed to further legitimise king's descended from Óláfr. In consequence, even the chronicle's claim that Óláfr's father had chosen him as his successor may be suspect. Whatever the case, the chronicle is the main historical {{source for the}} life of Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Ashley {{plays on}} the beach and builds sand castles. When Ashley's drunken mother phones, {{demanding}} to know where her son is, Uncle David feigns ignorance, telling her that he himself is not in Sheppey but in Manchester. Taking Ashley to an abandoned military bunker, he injects an unknown substance into his nephew's vein as they kiss. Ashley enters an altered state of consciousness, and David guides him back to the caravan as they smoke marijuana. Once there, David gives Ashley a second injection, as they sit and look out at the shore. After dark, David places his near-catatonic nephew in a dog bed, showing him <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> picture book titled Is Britain Great?. He proceeds to give him a third and final injection, which he remarks will make Ashley lose consciousness and suffer organ failure. As Ashley dies, David professes that he has never loved anyone else as much before. The next morning, he goes onto the beach to place his nephew's body in a shallow grave, tearfully kissing the body goodbye before it is swept away by the sea.|$|E
