5000|$|The NATO Medal is an {{international}} military decoration which is awarded to various militaries of the world {{under the authority of}} the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). It is manufactured by Eekelers-Centini Intl, of Hemiksem, Belgium. There are currently fourteen versions of the NATO Medal in existence, for service in Yugoslavia, Kosovo, the Republic of Macedonia, two for service during <b>Article</b> <b>5</b> <b>operations</b> (Eagle Assist, Active Endeavour), and eight for Non-Article <b>5</b> NATO <b>operations</b> (ISAF, Resolute Support, Balkans, NTM-Iraq, Africa, AMIS, OUP-Libya, and Pakistan). In addition, there are corresponding clasps for operations such as ISAF, Kosovo, Yugoslavia, NTM-Iraq and clasps designating <b>Article</b> <b>5,</b> and Non-Article 5 designations. There is also a NATO Meritorious Service Medal, with a [...] "Meritorious Service" [...] clasp as well. However, U.S. military personnel do not wear the clasps on the NATO Medals, since the U.S. has its own devices used instead.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} group the {{functional}} requirements for support to operations by modern information systems systematically, the NATO Code of best Practise (COBP) for C 2 Assessment defines three domain areas: Battlespace Visualization, Decision Making, and Battle Management Functions. In addition, within an domain overlapping information grid {{of the information}} system, necessary functions for assessing and disseminating the information are capsulated. For all three domains, including the overlapping information grid, the respective requirements for functional support have to be met be future command, control, communications, and intelligence (C 3 I) systems. The paper describes the functional categories of the three domains having been defined for <b>article</b> <b>5</b> <b>operations,</b> extends them {{to meet the requirements}} for operations other than war (OOTW), and gives some examples how modules of simulation systems can deliver respective support functions. In addition, references defining migration procedures for legacy systems to enable a smooth change from the old to the new C 3 I paradigm are given.

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis NATO's Crisis response {{operations in}} the light of Yugoslav wars deals with the development of the security policy of NATO in the 1990 's in the sense of Non- <b>Article</b> <b>5</b> crisis response <b>operations.</b> First, NATO's strategic concepts of 1991 and 1999 are compared. The differences in these concepts illustrate the change of fundamental objectives and means of the Alliance in the area of crisis response operations. Analysis of the events in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the years 1992 - 1995 and Kosovo in 1998 - 1999 follows. Crucial moments of NATO's involvement in these conflicts are observed. Based on this analysis, the thesis is trying to define how the events in former Yugoslavia influenced the development of the official NATO policy, which is based on the aforementioned strategic concepts...|$|R
50|$|To {{differentiate}} between the versions of the NATO Medal, a different ribbon pattern scheme is used {{for each of the}} decorations. The NATO Medal for Yugoslavia Service consists of a blue ribbon with two thin white stripes on each side, very similar in appearance to the United Nations Medal. The NATO Medal for Kosovo service appears as a mixed blue and white stripped ribbon, with white stripes on the side as well as a wide white central stripe. The NATO Medal for Macedonia appears as a blue and white mixed ribbon with four white stripes. The <b>Article</b> <b>5</b> NATO Medal for Operation Eagle Assist has a blue background with a thin central golden stripe surrounded by white stripes. The <b>Article</b> <b>5</b> Medal for <b>Operation</b> Active Endeavour has a blue background with two thin golden colored stripes surrounded by white stripes. The Non-Article 5 medal for the Balkans operations consists of a blue background with a central silver stripe surrounded by white stripes. The Non <b>Article</b> <b>5</b> Medal for ISAF, and NTM-I operations consists of a blue background with two silver stripes surrounded by white stripes. The NATO Meritorious Service Medal consists of a blue background with silver and white stripes on the outer most portion of the ribbon, and the medallion color is changed from bronze in appearance to a silver medallion for this medal only. All medals except the Macedonian NATO Medal have corresponding campaign clasps, however some militaries (such as the United States) prohibit the wearing of the medal with a clasp and instead authorize service stars.|$|R

5000|$|Since Tan was {{deprived}} of gainful employment without a fair hearing, under this broad interpretation of <b>Article</b> <b>5,</b> his dismissal was wrongful and unconstitutional. In 1997, the Federal Court cited the decision with approval {{as part of}} an obiter dictum in R. Rama Chandran v. The Industrial Court of Malaysia. However, when ruling directly on the interpretation of <b>Article</b> <b>5</b> in 2002, the Federal Court held in Pihak Berkuasa Negeri Sabah v. Sugumar Balakrishnan & Another that a generous reading of the term [...] "personal liberty" [...] in <b>Article</b> <b>5</b> was in error. The Federal Court later revisited the issue in 2009, and ruled in Lee Kwan Woh v. Public Prosecutor that constitutional rights, including those under <b>Article</b> <b>5,</b> must be read in a generous and liberal fashion.|$|R
40|$|The European Court of Human Rights held in Austin & Others v The United Kingdom {{that the}} police {{confinement}} of a crowd of protestors for up to seven hours, or 'kettling', did not constitute a deprivation of liberty in violation of <b>Article</b> <b>5</b> of the European Convention of Human Rights. Austin {{was the first time}} the Court considered the application of <b>Article</b> <b>5</b> to the practice of kettling. The Court's previous <b>Article</b> <b>5</b> jurisprudence demonstrates that when analysing whether an individual has been unlawfully deprived of his or her liberty, the Court will consider the type of measure, its duration, its effects on the individual, and the manner of implementation of the restrictive measure. In Austin, the Court introduced a new factor in this analysis - the context in which the measure is imposed. This article examines the Court's deprivation of liberty jurisprudence, as well as the <b>Article</b> <b>5</b> exceptions to the prohibition of deprivation of liberty. Finally, the Court's finding in Austin is analysed to determine whether it now recognises a 'public safety exception' to <b>Article</b> <b>5.</b> </p...|$|R
