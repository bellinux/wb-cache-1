2500|$|The US Federal Aviation Administration defines it as: [...] "the {{maximum speed}} in the takeoff {{at which the}} pilot must take the first action (e.g., apply brakes, reduce thrust, deploy speed brakes) to stop the {{airplane}} within the <b>accelerate-stop</b> <b>distance.</b> V1 also means the minimum speed in the takeoff, following {{a failure of the}} critical engine at VEF, at which the pilot can continue the takeoff and achieve the required height above the takeoff surface within the takeoff distance." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Accelerate-Stop</b> <b>Distance</b> Available - The {{length of}} the takeoff run {{available}} plus the {{length of the}} stopway, if stopway is provided.|$|E
50|$|To {{achieve a}} {{balanced}} field takeoff, engine power is selected to provide enough acceleration {{so that at}} the lowest possible speed to continue the takeoff the remaining necessary takeoff distance with one engine not working {{is equal to the}} remaining and necessary <b>accelerate-stop</b> <b>distance.</b>|$|E
50|$|Calculation of the {{balanced}} field length traditionally involves relying on an expansion program model, where the various forces are evaluated {{as a function}} of speed, and step-wise integrated, using an estimate for V1. The process is iterated with different values for the engine failure speed until the <b>accelerate-stop</b> and accelerate-go <b>distances</b> are equal. This process suffers from the inherently slow and repetitive approach, which is also subject to round-off errors if the speed increment between the steps is not carefully selected, which could cause some issues in first principle aircraft performance models provided to airlines for day-to-day operations. Alternate approaches using a more mathematically complex but inherently more accurate and faster algebraic integration method have however been developed.|$|R
50|$|A {{balanced}} field takeoff is {{a condition}} where the <b>accelerate-stop</b> <b>distance</b> required (ASDR) {{is equal to the}} takeoff distance required (TODR) for the aircraft weight, engine thrust, aircraft configuration and runway condition. For a given aircraft weight, engine thrust, aircraft configuration, and runway condition, the shortest runway length that complies with safety regulations is the balanced field length.|$|E
50|$|Using the {{balanced}} field takeoff concept, V1 is {{the maximum speed}} in the takeoff at which the pilot must take the first action (e.g. reduce thrust, apply brakes, deploy speed brakes) to stop the airplane within the <b>accelerate-stop</b> <b>distance</b> and the minimum speed at which the takeoff can be continued and achieve the required height above the takeoff surface within the takeoff distance.|$|E

50|$|Aviation regulations, {{especially}} FAR 25 and CS-25 (for large passenger aircraft) {{require the}} takeoff distance and the <b>accelerate-stop</b> <b>distance</b> {{to be less}} than or equal to the available runway length, both with and without an engine failure assumed. The speed below which takeoff must be aborted upon engine failure is called V1. On longer runways a pilot can nominate a V1 within a range, but where the runway length is no longer than the balanced field length only one value for V1 will exist.|$|E
40|$|The {{influences}} of bypass ratio variation of turbofan engines in airplane runway performance are investigated more deeply {{in this work}} utilising a take-off analysis software developed by Ishizuka (2003). An initial study {{was carried out by}} Mourão, Negrão and Barbosa (2003). The results are analysed and discussed according to the operational feasibility of operators and technical feasibility of engine manufacturers. The analysis is based on comparisons of gains/losses in take-off distance, <b>accelerate-stop</b> <b>distance</b> and take-off weight for a range of bypass ratio values. Also, suggestions for future studies and researches are given his document is intended also to provide satisfactory background information of the take-off process and its mandatory regulations (FAR Part 25, 1998) as much for commercial airplanes as for military airplanes. The aim is to contribute to readers' knowledge interested instudying more deeply the particularities of this specific flight phase and improving its operational safety...|$|E
