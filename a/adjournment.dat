5|$|Chas. H. Ross and Mr. Haybeck then {{testified to}} the {{articles}} he recovered from the Spray. The prosecutor, William H. Jelliffe, asked for another <b>adjournment</b> to await the arrival of Willis to testify to the collision. Voorhees opposed the <b>adjournment</b> and moved for Jackalow's immediate release {{on the ground that}} there was no jurisdiction because no crime had been proved to have been committed. Jeliffe replied that he intended to charge murder, piracy, and running away with a vessel with intent to steal it. Vroom granted an <b>adjournment</b> until Tuesday at 11am. Jackalow was remanded to the city prison.|$|E
5|$|Dietrich's other {{argument}} {{was that the}} trial judge should have used discretionary powers and granted an <b>adjournment</b> until Dietrich was able to provide counsel himself, and that the {{failure to do so}} caused a miscarriage of justice. Dietrich had asked the trial judge for an <b>adjournment</b> during the trial, but the judge said that since more than a year had passed since the offence occurred, it was {{in the interests of the}} community that the matter be dealt with promptly.|$|E

50|$|With {{the advent}} of strong chess playing {{computer}} programs, {{which can be used}} to analyze adjourned positions, most tournaments have abandoned adjourning games in favor of shorter time controls. The first World Chess Championship not to use <b>adjournments</b> was the Classical World Chess Championship 1995, while the last one to use <b>adjournments</b> was the FIDE World Chess Championship 1996.|$|R
5|$|Finally, defense {{asked for}} <b>adjournment</b> {{as a key}} witness fell ill. The court decided to {{continue}} with the hearings the next day, after which the hearings would be adjourned until March 4, 2013, in order to hear the defense's witness. Blythe committed to return when the trial resumed.|$|E
5|$|Surprised by Aberhart's {{refusal to}} be drawn into open conflict, the insurgents needed time to {{reassess}} their strategy. They got that time when, on March17, Lieutenant-Governor Primrose died, necessitating a five-day <b>adjournment</b> while the federal government selected a replacement. When the legislature reconvened March 22 or 23, the dissidents filibustered against the budget. Albert Bourcier opened debate, and was followed by, among others, Edith Rogers, Ansley, and Wilson Cain. On March24, Harry Knowlton Brown moved an <b>adjournment,</b> which was carried over the government's objections by a vote of 27 to 25. Though the insurgents considered this a vote of non-confidence in Aberhart's government, he refused to resign; he acknowledged, however, that he would do so if the budget itself was defeated.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{declared}} war in June 1812, and after its <b>adjournment,</b> Johnson returned to Kentucky to recruit volunteers. So many men responded that he chose only those with horses, {{and raised a}} body of mounted rifles. Johnson recruited 300 men, divided into three companies, who elected him major. They merged with another battalion, forming a regiment of 500 men, with Johnson as colonel.|$|E

5|$|Monroe {{remained}} {{the commanding officer}} of the 114th Regiment until its disbandment by the Congress of the Confederate States in April 1862. While serving in the Confederate States Army, Monroe completed another term {{as a member of}} the Virginia House of Delegates between 1862 and 1865. He participated in the Virginia General Assembly for each legislative session conducted during wartime, returning to his military duties following each session's <b>adjournment.</b>|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth and Mary {{were soon}} sent to Novigrad Castle, with John of Palisna as their new jailer. Margaret insisted that Elizabeth {{be put to}} death. She was tried and, after the Christmas <b>adjournment</b> of the proceedings, found guilty of inciting Charles' murder. Sigismund marched into Slavonia in January 1387, with the {{intention}} to reach Novigrad and rescue the queens. Towards the middle of January, when news of Sigismund's approach reached Novigrad, Elizabeth was strangled by guards before Mary's eyes.|$|E
5|$|The Indiana General Assembly {{is made up}} of two houses, the House of Representatives and the Senate. Indiana has a {{part-time}} legislature that does not meet year-round. The General Assembly convenes on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in January. During odd-numbered years the legislature meets for 61days (not necessarily consecutively) and must be adjourned by April 30. During even-numbered years the legislature meets for 30days (not necessarily consecutively) and must be adjourned by March 15. The General Assembly may not adjourn for more than three days without a resolution approving <b>adjournment</b> being passed in both houses.|$|E
60|$|There {{is still}} this fourth Vote then, growls indignant Patriotism:--this vote, {{and who knows}} what other votes, and <b>adjournments</b> of voting; and the whole matter still {{hovering}} hypothetical! And at every new vote those Jesuit Girondins, even they who voted for Death, would so fain find a loophole! Patriotism must watch and rage. Tyrannical <b>adjournments</b> there have been; one, and now another at midnight on plea of fatigue,--all Friday wasted in hesitation and higgling; in re-counting of the votes, which are found correct as they stood! Patriotism bays fiercer than ever; Patriotism, by long-watching, has become red-eyed, almost rabid.|$|R

5|$|A typical {{session of}} the Senate begins with a call to order by the President of the Senate. After the call to order, the {{previous}} day's journal is approved, petitions are heard, and orders involving committee and leadership appointments or changes to the rules are presented. First, readings of legislation take place. Senators are then given leeway to introduce any visitors, often people observing its deliberations from the gallery above the Senate chamber. Then the Senators consider legislation. They begin with unfinished business from the previous session, then consider legislation and special orders with accompanying reports from committees. At {{the discretion of the}} presiding officer, the Senate may adjourn at any time, unless a majority of members present object to <b>adjournment.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before the <b>adjournment</b> of the House in September 1789, they {{requested}} Hamilton to make {{a report}} on suggestions to improve the public credit by January 1790. Hamilton had written to Robert Morris as early as 1781 that fixing the public credit will win their objective of independence. The sources that Hamilton used ranged from Frenchmen such as Jacques Necker and Montesquieu to British writers such as Hume, Hobbes, and Malachy Postlethwayt. While writing the report he also sought out suggestions from contemporaries such as John Knox Witherspoon, and Madison. Although they agreed on additional taxes such as distilleries and duties on imported liquors and land taxes, Madison feared that the securities from the government debt would fall in foreign hands.|$|E
5|$|Dietrich v The Queen, is an {{important}} legal case, stemming from an incident that took place on 17 December 1986, that was decided in the High Court of Australia on 13 November 1992. It concerned {{the nature of the}} right to a fair trial, and under what circumstances indigent defendants (defendants who cannot afford legal representation) should be provided with legal aid by the state. The case determined that although there is no absolute right to have publicly funded counsel, in most circumstances a judge should grant any request for an <b>adjournment</b> or stay when an accused is unrepresented. It is {{an important}} case in Australian criminal law, and also in Australian constitutional law, since it is one of many cases in which some members of the High Court have found implied human rights in the Australian Constitution.|$|E

5000|$|The Cavalier {{parliament}} {{went through}} seventeen sessions, although some sessions were broken up by <b>adjournments</b> and recesses (an [...] "adjournment" [...] only interrupts a session; a [...] "prorogation" [...] ends a session, a [...] "dissolution" [...] ends a parliament).|$|R
5|$|Early on {{the third}} day, Lindwall bowled Edrichโwho was playing across the lineโbetween bat and pad for 28, hitting the off stump with a ball that cut inwards, leaving the score at 64/2, before Compton and Hutton {{consolidated}} the innings and took the score to 121 at lunch without further loss. Hutton and Compton were 42 and 37 respectively. Compton started slowly but had accelerated as the <b>adjournment</b> approached. The morning's batting had been relatively slow, with only 67 runs scored in 100minutes, of which Hutton added only 23. The morning session also featured a tight spell of 13 overs by Ring. The leg spinner did not bowl consistently or accurately, and although the batsman hit him regularly, they did not place their shots, which often went to the fielders. At the other end, Johnston bowled his finger spin from around the wicket with a well-protected off side. There were four men in the off side ring and they had {{much work to do}} as Hutton hit the ball there repeatedly. The English batsmen progressed steadily and both Johnston and Ring had one confident appeal for lbw against Compton, but there were no other scares. Towards the end of the morning session, the second new ball became available but Bradman decided to bide his time. He allowed Johnston to rest after his morning spell and used Lindwall and Millerโdelivering off spinnersโto bowl with the old ball for the last half hour before lunch break so that the trio could use the <b>adjournment</b> to recuperate before attacking with the new ball.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton's faction {{were against}} any {{conditional}} ratification, {{under the impression}} that New York would not be accepted into the Union, while Clinton's faction wanted to amend the Constitution, while maintaining the state's right to secede if their attempts failed. During the state convention, New Hampshire and Virginia becoming the ninth and tenth states to ratify the Constitution, respectively, had ensured any <b>adjournment</b> would not happen and a compromise would have to be reached. Hamilton's arguments used for the ratifications were largely iterations of work from The Federalist Papers, and Smith eventually went for ratification, though it was more out of necessity than Hamilton's rhetoric. The vote in the state constitution was ratified 30 to 27, on July 26, 1788.|$|E
5|$|In {{his last}} act of public service, in 1839 Rowan was {{appointed}} as a commissioner to adjust land claims of U.S. citizens against the Republic of Mexico. During an <b>adjournment</b> {{of the commission}} in 1842, Rowan returned to Kentucky to visit relatives. While there, he fell ill {{and was unable to}} return to Washington, D.C.; consequently, he resigned his commission. Rowan died July 13, 1843. He was interred in the family burial ground at Federal Hill. In his will, Rowan specified that no marker should be placed over his grave, noting that his parents' graves had no markers, and {{he did not want to}} be honored above his parents. Several years later, members of his family placed a marker over his grave, despite his wishes. According to legend, the marker frequently tumbles from its base, purportedly a manifestation of Rowan haunting his grave.|$|E
50|$|Committees of Safety were a later {{outcome of}} the {{committees}} of correspondence. Committees of safety were executive bodies that governed during <b>adjournments</b> of, were created by, and derived their authority from, provincial assemblies or congresses, {{like those of the}} New York Provincial Congress.|$|R

40|$|This report first {{describes}} how pertinent {{rules and practices}} regulate the daily sessions of Congress and their <b>adjournments</b> and recesses, including discussion of the "legislative day. " It then develops a corresponding discussion for the annual sessions of Congress, which addresses, among other things, the use of "pro forma sessions. " The report clarifies certain situations in which terms may simultaneously apply in different ways {{in relation to the}} daily session and to the annual session. Finally, the report notes {{some of the most important}} implications of the occurrence of sessions, <b>adjournments,</b> and recesses in relation to such matters as presidential action on legislation, recess appointments by the President, the operation of statutory expedited procedures ("fast track" procedures), and "lame duck" (post-election) sessions...|$|R
5|$|Mansfield {{ordered a}} hearing for 22 January 1772. Following an <b>adjournment,</b> {{the case was}} not heard until 7 February 1772. In the meantime, the case had {{attracted}} {{a great deal of}} attention in the press, and members of the public were forthcoming with donations to fund lawyers for both sides of the argument. An activist layman, Granville Sharp, who continually sought test cases against the legal justifications for slavery, was Somersett's real backer. When the case was heard, no fewer than five advocates appeared for the slave, speaking at three separate hearings between February and May. These lawyers included William Davy SL, John Glynn SL, James Mansfield and Francis Hargrave, who was later to become a noted barrister based on his work in this case. Charles Stewart was represented by John Dunning and James Wallace.|$|E
5|$|Substantial combat {{had ended}} {{but the war}} had not, and a formal treaty of peace was months away. The British still had 26,000 troops occupying New York City, Charleston, and Savannah, and had a {{powerful}} fleet. The French army and navy departed, so the Americans were on their own in 1782โ83. Money matters fed the anxiety; the treasury was empty, and the unpaid soldiers were growing restive {{almost to the point}} of mutiny. At one point, they forced an <b>adjournment</b> of the Congress from Philadelphia to Princeton. Washington dispelled unrest among officers by suppressing the Newburgh Conspiracy in March 1783, and Congress came up with the promise of a five-year bonus.|$|E
5|$|Yardley {{decided to}} use the medium roller to flatten out the surface, but further showers breathed more life into the pitch, forcing a rain break {{immediately}} after the start of England's run chase. The rain immediately stopped after the players returned to the pavilion, but upon promptly returning to the middle, the rain started again. The players returned after 15 minutes and played for approximately half an hour, before Washbrook and Hutton unsuccessfully appealed against the light. Rain then came again for another 40 minutes, which included the tea break. The weather cleared in time for the normal resumption of play at 4:30 after the scheduled <b>adjournment.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{trial is}} still on {{in the court of}} Law with Gbenga Daniel having the upper hand as most of the {{allegations}} have not been backed with credible and strong facts and documents.
