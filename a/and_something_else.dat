The problems with this position have been described by Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression, for any expression of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we {{will never be able to}} master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them. Given a sentence P, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, the result is that P means one thing for Fred <b>and</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> for Mary. Moreover, if a sentence P derives its meaning from its relations with all of the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of P. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that P has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth of a sentence and then reject it later on, the meaning of that which I rejected and that which I accepted are completely different and therefore I cannot change my opinions with regard to the same sentences.|$|E
25|$|If π1(M) has an {{infinite}} normal cyclic subgroup {{but is not}} virtually solvable then the geometric structure on M is either H2×R or the universal cover of SL(2, R). The manifold M may be either compact or non-compact. If it is compact, then the 2 geometries can be distinguished by whether or not π1(M) has a finite index subgroup that splits as a semidirect product of the normal cyclic subgroup <b>and</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> If the manifold is non-compact, then the fundamental group cannot distinguish the two geometries, and there are examples (such as the complement of a trefoil knot) where a manifold may have a finite volume geometric structure of either type.|$|E

I plugged it in, and there was this incredible sound I'd never heard before. All these songs poured out from this one sound. Something has to inspire you, <b>and</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> takes over. It's very cloudy." [...] Martin also noted that the song is [...] "probably the most important song we've ever written".|$|E

2500|$|Another {{thing that}} makes it {{resemble}} our earlier records, especially our first record, is that it's really personal. A couple of us have gone through some pretty serious life changes.

There's a song on the record, [...] "Dorothy", that was really influenced by the film Blue Velvet but it's a metaphor for someone <b>and</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> Everything on the record is stuff that definitely hits close to home for us and we tried to communicate that in the songs.|$|E

2500|$|In a book {{published}} by Encounter Books, Caroline Fourest {{claimed to have}} analysed Tariq Ramadan's 15 books, 1,500 pages of interviews, and approximately 100 recordings, and concludes [...] "Ramadan is a war leader", an [...] "islamist" [...] and the [...] "political heir of his grandfather", Hassan al-Banna, stating that his discourse is [...] "often just a repetition of the discourse that Banna had {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century in Egypt", and that he [...] "presents [...] as a model to be followed." [...] She argues that [...] "Tariq Ramadan is slippery. He says one thing to his faithful Muslim followers <b>and</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> entirely to his Western audience. His choice of words, the formulations he uses – even his tone of voice – vary, chameleon-like, according to his audience." [...] Ramadan claims that Fourest's book contains 200 errors, only three of which she has confirmed.|$|E
2500|$|Richard P. Havens, 1983 is a 1969 double album set by folk rock {{musician}} Richie Havens {{featuring a}} combination of studio recordings and live material recorded in concert in July, 1968. The album combined original material with several of the covers for which Havens is known. Notable songs include [...] "Handsome Johnny" [...] and the singles [...] "Stop Pushing and Pulling Me" [...] and [...] "Indian Rope Man", the latter {{of which has been}} multiply covered under its own name and in retooled identity as [...] "African Herbsman." [...] The genre-bending album was critically and commercially well-received, reaching #80 on the Billboard [...] "Pop Albums" [...] chart. Initially released on the Verve label, it has been reissued multiple times in various formats, including by Verve subsidiary Verve Forecast Records, PolyGram and Australian label Raven Records. It has also been compiled with albums Mixed Bag <b>and</b> <b>Something</b> <b>Else</b> Again in multi-cd set [...] on the Hip-O Select label.|$|E
2500|$|An American geologist, Clayborne {{is one of}} {{the first}} areologists and {{maintains}} a stalwart desire to see Mars preserved in the state it holds when humans arrive. [...] Clayborne early on debates Saxifrage Russell over the proper role of humanity on Mars and though initially apolitical, this stance marks her as the original [...] "Red," [...] while Russell's hands-on terraforming reflects the antithesis of these views. [...] Clayborne is shown to prefer solitude during much of the series, and even her relationship with fellow First Hundred settler Simon (with whom she has a child) is subject to introspective silence in most cases. [...] Simon's death and the estrangement she finds from their son Peter when the latter emerges as a leading moderate [...] "green" [...] drive her to further isolation. [...] Clayborne's relationship with Russell is shown to be complex, the two of them taking early opposite views but the situation slowly changing as Russell comes to appreciate what has been unleashed and what has indeed been lost as science gives way to commercial exploitation that he cannot control. [...] During the events of Blue Mars, Russell intervenes to save Clayborne's life; later, the two are revealed to have once shared an attraction that went astray because of a casual misinterpretation between them. Ann undergoes a drastic change towards Blue Mars due to the emergence of something inside of her which she describes as anti-Ann <b>and</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> which she can't quite describe.|$|E
