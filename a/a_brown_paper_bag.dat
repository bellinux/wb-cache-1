25|$|Genetic drift is a {{cause of}} allelic {{frequency}} change within populations of a species. Alleles are different variations of specific genes. They determine things like hair color, skin tone, eye color and blood type; in other words, all the genetic traits that vary between individuals. Genetic drift does not introduce new alleles to a population, but it can reduce variation within a population by removing an allele from the gene pool. Genetic drift is caused by random sampling of alleles. A truly random sample is a sample in which no outside forces affect what is selected. It is like pulling marbles {{of the same size}} and weight but of different colors from <b>a</b> <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag.</b> In any offspring, the alleles present are samples of the previous generations alleles, and chance plays a role in whether an individual survives to reproduce and to pass a sample of their generation onward to the next. The allelic frequency of a population is the ratio of the copies of one specific allele that share the same form compared to the number of all forms of the allele present in the population.|$|E

2500|$|New South Wales {{selection}} bias is a perceived bias by selectors of the Australian cricket teams towards players from New South Wales. It was exemplified in a quote by former South Australian captain David Hookes who said that, [...] "when they give out the baggy blue cap in New South Wales, {{they give you}} a baggy green one in <b>a</b> <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> as well to save making two presentations". This is an example of confirmation bias and Hookes' comment came at a time when, especially during the 1980s, there was a public perception that strong performances by non-NSW players were often ignored by the Australian selectors in favour of seemingly under-performing NSW players who were selected for the Test and/or One-Day team. The claims persist {{in spite of the fact}} that no New South Welshman has occupied a position on the National Selection Panel since John Benaud in 1994.|$|E
2500|$|Bill Vander Zalm {{became the}} new Socred leader when Smith threw his support to him rather than see McCarthy win, {{and led the}} party to victory in the {{election}} later that year. Vander Zalm was later involved in {{a conflict of interest}} scandal following the sale of Fantasy Gardens, a Christian and Dutch culture theme park built by the Premier, to Tan Yu, a Filipino Chinese gambling kingpin. There were also concerns over Yu's application to the government for a bank licence, and lurid stories from flamboyant realtor Faye Leung of a party in the [...] "Howard Hughes Suite" [...] on the top two floors of the Bayshore Inn, where Tan Yu had been staying, with reports of a bag of money in <b>a</b> <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> passed from Yu to Vander Zalm during the goings-on. These scandals forced Vander Zalm's resignation, and Rita Johnston became premier of the province. Johnston presided over the end of Social Credit power, calling an election which led to the reducing of the party's caucus to only two seats, and the revival of the long-defunct British Columbia Liberal Party as Opposition to the victorious NDP under former Vancouver mayor Mike Harcourt.|$|E

The poem for which she became famous was originally composed on <b>a</b> <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> shopping <b>bag,</b> and was reportedly inspired by {{the story of a young}} Jewish girl, Margaret Schwarzkopf, who had been staying with the Frye household and had been unable to visit her dying mother in Germany because of anti-Semitic unrest.

Hemme transitioned into a [...] face by defeating Sky on the October 23, 2008 episode of Impact!. She feuded with the Beautiful People, which resulted in two consecutive tag team matches with ODB and Sojourner Bolt as per partners, respectively. After showcasing improved wrestling skills, Hemme was then placed into a more active in-ring role, being pushed to challenge Awesome Kong for the TNA Women's Knockout Championship at Final Resolution, after defeating Raisha Saeed on the November 27 episode of TNA Impact!. Hemme then teamed with A.J. Styles in a mixed tag team match against Kong and Scott Steiner, where Hemme pinned Kong. At Final Resolution, Hemme was attacked by Saeed and Rhaka Khan and won the match by disqualification, and thus Kong retained the title. Hemme was subsequently granted a rematch at Genesis. A week later, Hemme teamed with ODB against Khan and Saeed in a winning effort. On January 2009, Hemme sustained a neck injury while training in the ring with Styles for her match, and was deemed unable to compete at Genesis.|$|E

50|$|The Brown Paper Bag Test was a type {{of racial}} {{discrimination}} in the United States. <b>A</b> <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> {{was used as a}} way {{to determine whether or not}} an individual could have certain privileges; only individuals with a skin color that is the same color or lighter than <b>a</b> <b>brown</b> <b>paper</b> <b>bag</b> were allowed. The test was used in the 20th century within many social institutions such as African-American sororities, fraternities, and churches. In addition, brown paper bags were used in multi-racial social events. The term is also used in reference to larger issues of class and social stratification within the African-American population.
