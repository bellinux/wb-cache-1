One unmarked car with white officers sat on Lakeview Avenue between Moulton and Auburndale, and another with white officers sat at the intersection of Auburndale and E. 124th Street. At 7:50 PM, Forbes and Beach arrived at Evans' home. They talked with him for 15 minutes, during which time Evans expressed his anxiety about the police and his concern {{that he was going to}} be harassed again. Forbes attempted to have the stationary surveillance removed, but was advised by the city's Safety Director, James McManamon, to speak with Mayor Stokes. Forbes reached Stokes, but Stokes was interrupted by <b>another</b> <b>call</b> and asked Forbes to call back in 15 minutes. During this time, Forbes drove to the home of Harllel Jones, an Evans associate. While speaking with Jones, they learned that the shootout had begun.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2012–13 {{basketball}} season, allegations surfaced from former and current players accusing Gillispie of mistreatment. Fifteen players departed prematurely in the year after Gillispie arrived, a very high number for a college basketball program in a major conference. Also leaving were two strength coaches and two directors of basketball operations; some 30 persons overall. The allegations include forcing injured players to practice, keeping players Ty Nurse and Dejan Kravic in doubt about their scholarship status, and reneging on promises to potential new coaching staff hires. Shortly after the allegations were initially reported and he was due to meet with athletic director Kirby Hocutt about the allegations, Gillispie was hospitalized for six days with heart-attack like symptoms and high blood pressure after calling EMS. He left the hospital on September 6. <b>Another</b> <b>call</b> to EMS was made September 10, but did not require hospitalization. On September 11, Gillispie took an indefinite medical leave, and checked himself into the Mayo Clinic. He was treated there for 'kidney problems' and 'abnormal headaches', and told to live in a stress-free environment for 30 days. Assistant head coach Chris Walker took over the day-to-day operations of the basketball team.|$|E

500|$|When breeding, the {{black-necked grebe}} gives a quiet [...] "ooeek" [...] that ascends in pitch from an already high pitch.

This grebe is silent when it is not the breeding season and when it is feeding or resting.|$|E
500|$|<b>Another</b> <b>call</b> {{that does}} not fit into the two {{categories}} is a long, drawn out, monosyllabic [...] "waaaaah" [...] sound. As it is commonly heard during the breeding season, it {{is thought to be}} emitted by vixens summoning males. When danger is detected, foxes emit a monosyllabic bark. At close quarters, it is a muffled cough, while at long distances it is sharper. Kits make warbling whimpers when nursing, these calls being especially loud when they are dissatisfied.|$|E
500|$|In Newark, a city worker named Craig {{is pulled}} {{underwater}} in the sewers but is rescued by his co-worker. He believes he {{was attacked by}} a python.

500|$|Although it is {{generally}} a silent species, during the breeding season the vocalizations of the long-tailed ground roller include a [...] "hooting" [...] sound, a [...] "popping" [...] tu-tuc, and a soft boo sound. The low-pitched [...] "hooting" [...] is given by males from a perch [...] above the ground at dusk or at night. The sound carries for a distance of at least [...] and may either attract a mate or defend a territory. The bird pumps its tail while giving this call. One territorial call {{is a series of}} soft boo notes, typically coming in sets of six to ten and descending in volume near the end. <b>Another</b> <b>call,</b> given by both sexes, is a series of chuckling tu-tuc sounds lasting between 10 and 40seconds that occasionally ends in a loud snapping sound produced by the wings. This call is given when birds are close to each other either on the ground or on low perches, and it does not carry over long distances. The use of wing-snapping to produce a sound is a rare phenomenon in birds, and in the order Coraciiformes only one other family, the todies, is known to do it. Low gu notes are given by mates as they come in contact with each other.|$|E
500|$|Clark {{received}} <b>another</b> <b>call</b> from General Shelton in July 1999 {{in which}} he was told that Secretary Cohen wanted Clark to leave his command in April 2000, less than three years after he assumed the post. Clark was surprised by this, because he believed SACEURs were expected to serve at least three years. Clark was told that this was necessary because General Joseph Ralston was leaving his post as the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and would need another 4-star command within 60 days or he would be forced to retire. Ralston {{was not going to be}} appointed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff due to an extramarital affair in his past, and the SACEUR position was said to be the last potential post for him. Clark said this explanation [...] "didn't wash"; he believed the legal issues did not necessarily bar him from a full term. Clinton signed on to Ralston's reassignment, although David Halberstam wrote that the president and Madeleine Albright were angered at Clark's treatment. Clark spent the remainder of his time as SACEUR overseeing peacekeeper forces and, without a new command to take, was forced into retirement from the military on May 2, 2000.|$|E
500|$|Striking at 5:30a.m. on Saturday, 16 December, the Germans {{achieved}} {{almost total}} surprise in {{breaking through the}} allied lines, beginning what is commonly called the Battle of the Bulge. The Germans launched their great attack of 1940 through the same region, with Generalfeldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt in command then as he was once again in this campaign. His goal was to separate the American forces from the British and Canadian forces, and take the important port city of Antwerp. By late afternoon the Germans had 14 divisions operating in the Ardennes, but this number would swell to an estimated 25 divisions, with 600 tanks and 1,000 aircraft. The 106th Division, located in the most exposed positions along the corps line, and the 28th Division took {{the brunt of the}} attack. Middleton, headquartered in Bastogne, was awakened by a guard and could hear the guns from there. Throughout the day, the 106th was able to hold its position, but additional German units poured in during the night. Much of the 106th was on the German side of the Our River in an area known as the Schnee Eifel. The division's commander, Major General Alan Jones, called Middleton, concerned about his two regiments east of the river. The conversation was interrupted by <b>another</b> <b>call,</b> and then resumed. At the end of the conversation Middleton told an aide that he had given his approval to have the two regiments pull back to {{the west side of the}} river. Jones, on the other hand was convinced that Middleton had directed these units to stay, and was further convinced of this based on a written order from earlier in the day, but just received. [...] As a result of the miscommunication, the pullback did not occur, and the two regiments were ultimately surrounded with most of the men captured on 17 December. [...] While two of the 28th Division's regiments survived the German onslaught intact, the 110th Infantry Regiment, commanded by Colonel Hurley Fuller, was directly in the path of the massive advance. On 17 December Fuller counterattacked, but his lone regiment was up against three German divisions, and when Fuller's command post was attacked his escape was thwarted and he was taken prisoner. Middleton next heard from him in April when he was released. Though the 110th Regiment was shattered, the stubborn resistance given by them and other VIII Corps units greatly slowed down the German timetable.|$|E
