25|$|Overtaking the disorganized convoy, {{during a}} {{tropical}} squall the next day, Ray fired on two radar contacts scoring hits.

The submarine scored two hits on the coastal minelayer Nasami, which disappeared in <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> and debris. The nearer destroyer began closing the range, and Trigger missed it with four aft tubes. She {{caught up with the}} convoy again and fired five torpedoes at the last ship. Two hits produced flames that reached mast height and several secondary explosions that marked the end of the 11,933-ton converted submarine tender Yasukuni Maru. Over three weeks later, the submarine terminated the patrol when she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 23 February.|$|E

Suddenly, a terrific explosion blew {{up one of the}} closer ships. One of the more distant ships stood straight up on her bow and sank immediately. At six minutes after midnight, Trigger launched three torpedoes at another group of ships and heard one timed explosion. At 01:57, she launched four torpedoes at a damaged cargo ship and two at an escort. The cargo ship received two more hits. Five minutes later, the submarine fired three stern tubes at a group of three escorts, and the middle one disappeared in <b>a</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke.</b> During the attack, Trigger sank the 11,739ton passenger/cargo ship Miike Maru and heavily damaged the destroyer escort Kasado, the 9,467ton cargo ship Hawaii Maru, and the 8,811ton cargo ship Asosan Maru. Trigger returned to Pearl Harbor on 20 May and four days later, headed for the United States for a major overhaul. She arrived at San Francisco, California, on 31 May and, after overhaul, returned to Hawaii on 11 September.|$|E
