40|$|Within a {{few years}} the study of obscure {{radiation}} has been greatly advanced by systematic inquiry into the laws of dispersion of the infra-red rays by Langley, Rubens, Rubens and Snow, and others. Along with this advancement has come the more extended study of absorption in this region. The absorption of atmospheric gases has been studied by Langley and Angstrom. Angstraom has made {{a study of the}} absorption of certain vapors in relation to the absorption of the same substances in the liquid state, and the absorption of a number of liquids and solids has been investigated by Rubens.

The factors affecting production of <b>ammonium</b> <b>alum</b> include molar ratio of ammonium to aluminum concentration, sulfuric acid concentration, mixing speed, mixing time, standing time, and temperature. According to the equation for the ammonium removal reaction, the theoretical quantity of <b>ammonium</b> <b>alum</b> was calculated based on initial and final concentrations of ammonium. Then, the weight of <b>ammonium</b> <b>alum</b> crystal was divided by the theoretical weight to derive the recovery ratio. The optimum sludge and sulfuric acid dosage to treat about 17  g L− 1 ammonium wastewater are 300  g L− 1 and 100  mL L− 1, respectively. The optimal dosage for wastewater is molar ratio of ammonium to aluminum of about 1 due to the aluminum dissolving in acidified wastewater. The ammonium removal efficiency is roughly 70 % and the maximum recovery ratio for <b>ammonium</b> <b>alum</b> is 93 % when the wastewater is mixed for 10  min at the mixing velocity gradient of 100  s− 1. <b>Ammonium</b> <b>alum</b> production or <b>ammonium</b> removal can be enhanced by controlling the reaction at low temperatures...|$|R

30|$|According to data in Table  1, {{most of the}} {{efflorescence}} in Aspaas House {{consists of}} double sulfate salts of the alum and Tutton’s salt types. However, except for potassium <b>alum</b> and <b>ammonium</b> iron sulfates, which were available as industrial products {{at the moment of}} house reassembling, other double sulfates cannot originate from the salt blend applied to logs. More probably, the original salt mixture consisted mostly of simple sulfate salts that generated double salts thereafter, during the crystallization process. The chemical composition of the efflorescence suggests that the impregnation mixture had the following composition (inferred content is given in mass % for each salt): ammonium sulfate ((NH 4) 2 SO 4; 30), aluminium sulfate (Al 2 (SO 4) 3 · 18 H 2 O; 15), magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O; 15), iron(II) sulfate (FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O; 15), zinc sulfate (ZnSO 4 · 7 H 2 O; 10), sodium sulfate (Na 2 SO 4 · 10 H 2 O; 10), and potassium alum (KAl(SO 4) 2 · 12 H 2 O; 5). When such a mixture is dissolved, the large content of ammonium ion renders the solution slightly acidic, thus preventing oxidation of iron (II) [36] as well as the hydrolysis of aluminium and other hydrated cations. Manganese and other low-concentration elements may originate from either mineral components of the wood or impurities in the preservative salt blend.|$|R

In a {{previous}} communication (Abstr., 1884, 256), {{the author has}} shown that lead, zinc, ammonium sulphate, and <b>ammonium</b> <b>alum,</b> when strongly compressed, exhibit a diminished density. These observations have been extended to various metals by Kahlbaum, Roth and Siedler (Abstr., 1902, ii, 259), and to steel by Grunmach (Ann. Phys. Chem., 1889, 67, 227). It is now shown that specimens of lead, tin, cadmium, and silver which have been forced through small apertures under pressure exhibit slight diminutions from the normal densities of these metals, whereas bismuth, similarly prepared, shows an increase in density. Further, when two plates of the same metal, one having been compressed and the other being the metal in the normal condition, are simultaneously placed in an electrolyte, a slight permanent current is produced, in one direction with the first four metals, which expand on liquefaction, and {{in the opposite direction}} for bismuth, which contracts when liquefied. Other slight changes in physical properties are also induced by strong compression. The author suggests that these changes in density are due to the assumption by these substances under compression of the molecular condition characteristic of the liquid state.

40|$|Flagella {{staining}} {{is generally}} considered a rather difficult pro-cedure {{and even with the}} most careful technique only a few of a great number of slides show satisfactory flagella. The main trouble with most flagella stains is that the mordant which is used is not stable. Good results may be obtained at one time and poor results the next. An important property of a good flagella stain should, then, be a stable mordant. Such a mordant was described by Gray (1). He mixed potassium alum, mercuric chloride, tannic acid, and alcoholic fuchsin and immediately poured the mixture on the smear. All these reagents are per-fectly stable and the stain can always be duplicated. It is excel-lent as compared with other flagella stains. A counter stain of a strong solution of basic fuchsin is also necessary. This stain gives most excellent results with the sporulating organisms such as B. vulgatus, B. subtilis, B. terminalis, Cl. botulinum, Cl. tetani, etc. With Bact. typhosum, and the Vibrios, not so good results are obtained.

This has led to the speculation that the reported solid-solid transition paths are impurity-conditioned. The purpose of the present investigation is to establish whether the pyrolytic formation of a-Al 2 o 3, the only thermodynamically stable form Al 2 o 3, from its oxysalts is restricted by the presence of residual impurities. If these barriers (impurities) are removed, the formation of a-Al 2 o 3 could occur at temperatures lower than those reported in literature. Thermoanalytical experiments were carried out on different aluminum oxysalts to determine the temperature at which the residue is Al 2 O 3.
