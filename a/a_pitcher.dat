50|$|Compared to <b>a</b> <b>pitcher's</b> {{batting average}} against, <b>a</b> <b>pitcher's</b> H/9 {{benefits}} from sacrifice bunts, double plays, runners caught stealing, and outfield assists, {{but it is}} hurt by some errors. Unlike batting average against, <b>a</b> <b>pitcher's</b> H/9 benefits from outs that {{are not related to}} official at bats, as they are recorded on runners after they have reached base.|$|R
5000|$|OPS is {{also useful}} when {{determining}} <b>a</b> <b>pitcher's</b> level of success. [...] "Opponent On-base Plus Slugging" [...] (OOPS) {{is becoming a}} popular tool to evaluate <b>a</b> <b>pitcher's</b> actual performance. When analyzing <b>a</b> <b>pitcher's</b> statistics, some useful categories to consider include K/9IP (strikeouts per nine innings), K/BB (strikeouts per walk), HR/9 (Home runs per nine innings), WHIP (walks plus hits per inning pitched) and OOPS (opponent on-base plus slugging).|$|R

5|$|Only {{four teams}} {{have never had}} <b>a</b> <b>pitcher</b> win the Cy Young Award. The Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers have won {{more than any other}} team with 12.|$|E
5000|$|Because <b>a</b> left-handed <b>pitcher</b> faces {{first base}} {{when he is}} in {{position}} to throw to the batter, whereas <b>a</b> right-handed <b>pitcher</b> has his back to first base, <b>a</b> left-handed <b>pitcher</b> has <b>an</b> advantage when attempting to pickoff baserunners at first base.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} {{that the system}} has over the official definition {{is that it allows}} a statistician a better view of the degree of quality in <b>a</b> <b>pitcher's</b> performance. Game scores can be quantified, and <b>a</b> <b>pitcher's</b> performance tracked over time. It is also possible to compare different pitchers. If one averages a 60 and another averages 55, presumably the first <b>pitcher</b> has had <b>a</b> better season.|$|R

In addition to Edgar Smith's batting notes above, he amassed a 15.43 ERA as <b>a</b> <b>pitcher,</b> striking out two.

5000|$|<b>A</b> relief <b>pitcher</b> may {{be given}} credit for earned runs that should have belonged to <b>a</b> {{previous}} <b>pitcher.</b>|$|R
5|$|Earned runs are runs {{that are}} {{directly}} attributable to <b>a</b> <b>pitcher's</b> efforts without <b>a</b> lapse by the defense. An unearned run does not adversely impact <b>a</b> <b>pitcher's</b> {{earned run average}} (ERA), and is only possible when an error (including catcher's interference) or a passed ball occurs earlier in the inning. Unearned runs are primarily discussed in rule 10.16 and often require a judgment call by the official scorer.|$|R
50|$|Component ERA or ERC is a {{baseball}} statistic invented by Bill James. It attempts to forecast <b>a</b> <b>pitcher's</b> {{earned run average}} (ERA) {{from the number of}} hits and walks allowed rather than the standard formula of average number of earned runs per nine innings. ERC allows one to take a fresh look at <b>a</b> <b>pitcher's</b> performance and gauge if his results are more or less {{than the sum of its}} parts.|$|R
5|$|At 16, Bresnahan {{signed with}} a semi-professional team from Manistee, Michigan. After he {{graduated}} high school, Bresnahan signed with Lima of the Ohio State League, {{where he played}} primarily as <b>a</b> <b>pitcher,</b> {{but also as a}} catcher in 1895 and 1896.|$|E

50|$|As {{it is an}} off-speed pitch, the {{splitter}} {{is generally}} thrown slower than <b>a</b> <b>pitcher's</b> fastball. According to PITCHf/x, the average four-seam fastball from <b>a</b> right-handed <b>pitcher</b> in 2010 was 92 mph, while the average splitter was 85 mph and the average changeup 83 mph.|$|R
