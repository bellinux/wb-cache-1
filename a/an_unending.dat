5|$|Acorn Antiques {{is perhaps}} the best-remembered regular item from the series. It was a spoof soap opera set in an {{antiques}} shop, which, despite its provincial high-street status, manages to supply <b>an</b> <b>unending</b> stream of works by Picasso, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. The two shop customers appearing {{at the start of}} each sketch, examining some antique, are always played by the same two actors. The sketch parodied the soap genre with its bad acting, ridiculous dialogue and contrived plot twists. Wood, as a homage, based it on the long-running ATV/Central serial Crossroads, and the BBC radio soap opera Waggoners Walk (1969–1980).|$|E
5|$|Marie St. Clare – Wife of Augustine, {{she is a}} self-absorbed woman {{without a}} hint of {{compassion}} for those around her, including her own family. Given to <b>an</b> <b>unending</b> list of (apparently imaginary) physical maladies, she continually complains about the lack of sympathy she is receiving. She has separated her personal maid, Mammy, from her own two children because they would interfere with her duties. As Marie drives Mammy to exhaustion, she criticizes her for selfishly seeking to attend her own family. Upon the unexpected death of Augustine, Marie countermands the legal process that would have given Tom his freedom.|$|E
5|$|Marian devotion {{grew from}} the 13th century, mostly forming around the {{concepts}} of the Immaculate Conception and her Assumption into heaven. In a culture that venerated the possession of relics {{as a means to}} bring the earthly closer to the divine, Mary left no bodily relics, thus assuming a special position between heaven and humanity. By the early 15th century, Mary had grown in importance within the Christian doctrine to the extent that she was commonly seen as the most accessible intercessor with God. It was thought that the length each person would need to suffer in limbo was proportional to their display of devotion while on earth. The veneration of Mary reached a peak in the early 15th century, an era that saw <b>an</b> <b>unending</b> demand for works depicting her likeness. From the mid-15th century, Netherlandish portrayals of the life of Christ tended to be centred on the iconography of the Man of Sorrows.|$|E

5|$|Lines {{had been}} {{hardening}} {{on the matter}} of slavery, and Democrats accused Harrison of being an abolitionist because of his membership, a half century earlier, in the Richmond Humane Society, an anti-slavery group; he had posted a mixed record on the issue while in Congress. On August 20, he gave a speech on the slave question at Carthage, Ohio, and stated that what occurred regarding slavery in a state was that state's business alone. He ignored the question of slavery in the District of Columbia and in the territories, both {{under the jurisdiction of the}} federal government. The general had pledged that his door would always be open to his old soldiers, but others came as well, and he hosted <b>an</b> <b>unending</b> series of guests. This was especially difficult for him on Sundays, when his wife forbade political discussion. The economy continued to be poor in 1840, a fact that the Whigs never ceased to press, arguing that Van Buren had done little, and that Harrison's inauguration was needed to put a stop to the hard times.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{introduces}} {{a new concept}} of the generation of <b>a</b> <b>unending</b> pool of keys through an image leaving behind the idea of sending keys every time for encryption and decryption. This can help in avoiding the problem of frequent key exchanges and the after affects associated with it. In this a single image is used to generate the various keys. Thus say,if the image is of 2 n bytes, taking n from 0 to any valid integer value gives a big pool of keys making it useful for any symmetric encryption technique, DES, AES, RC 4, CAST, twofish, blowfish etc. This adds the advantage of one time usage of key and avoids the disadvantage of securing and sending it on the network...|$|R

25|$|Gradually {{over the}} next 3,500 years, Leto not only survives, but also is {{transformed}} into a hybrid of human and giant sandworm. By the time of God Emperor of Dune, he has exterminated all other sandworms, and his own transformation has modified his component sandtrout. When Leto allows himself to be assassinated, the sandtrout release themselves to begin the sandworm lifecycle anew; subsequent offspring are tougher and more adaptable than their predecessors, allowing them to ultimately be more easily settled on other worlds, thus ensuring the survival of the sandworm species. Each one, according to Leto, carries in it a tiny pearl of his consciousness, trapped forever in <b>an</b> <b>unending</b> prescient dream.|$|E
25|$|A central axiom of Marxism is {{that the}} liberation {{of the working class}} must come {{at the hands of the}} working class itself. That this premise has been {{advanced}} by <b>an</b> <b>unending</b> string of middle-class intellectuals ranging from the professor-without-portfolio Dr. Karl Marx to the college-educated lawyer V. I. Lenin to lawyer and university lecturer Daniel DeLeon may be characterized as either inevitable, ironic, or a major contradiction, depending on one's personal perspective. Be that as it may, Marxists have universally assumed that only conscious and concerted effort by the working class itself can lead to cause the revolutionary transformation of economy and society. The devil lies in the details—how best to motivate this state of understanding and drive to action among those who sell their labor-power to others, how best to achieve the transformation of state and society.|$|E
25|$|On {{returning}} to London {{with his son}} in August 1827, Hazlitt was shocked to discover that his wife, still in Paris, was leaving him. He settled in modest lodgings on Half-Moon Street, and thereafter waged <b>an</b> <b>unending</b> battle against poverty, as he found himself forced to grind out a stream of mostly undistinguished articles for weeklies like The Atlas to generate desperately needed cash. Relatively little is known of Hazlitt's other activities in this period. He spent as much time, apparently, at Winterslow {{as he did in}} London. Some meditative essays emerged from this stay in his favourite country retreat, and he also made progress with his life of Napoleon. But he also found himself struggling against bouts of illness, nearly dying at Winterslow in December 1827. Two volumes—the first half—of the Napoleon biography appeared in 1828, only to have its publisher fail soon thereafter. This entailed even more financial difficulties for the author, and what little evidence we have of his activities at the time consists in large part of begging letters to publishers for advances of money.|$|E

25|$|Evgenii is accorded equal {{status with}} Peter in purely human terms, and his {{rebellion}} against state power {{is shown to}} be as admirable and significant in its way {{as that of the}} Decembrists. Yet turning now to the question of Evgenii’s role in the wider scheme of things, we have to admit that he seems an insignificant third factor in the equation when viewed {{against the backdrop of the}} titanic struggle taking place between Peter and the elements. Evgenii is utterly and completely helpless against both. The flood sweeps away all his dreams of happiness, and it is in the river that he meets his death. Peter’s statue, which at their first ‘encounter’ during the flood had its back turned to Evgenii as if ignoring him, late hounds him mercilessly when he dares to protest at Peter’s role in his suffering. The vast, impersonal forces of order and chaos, locked in <b>an</b> <b>unending</b> struggle– these,Pushkin seems to be saying, are the reality: these are the millstones of destiny or of the historical process to which Evgenii and his kind are but so much grist.|$|E
25|$|On {{the third}} day, Bhishma {{arranged}} the Kaurava {{forces in the}} formation of an eagle with himself leading from the front, while Duryodhana's forces protected the rear. Bhishma wanted to be sure of avoiding any mishap. The Pandavas countered this by using the crescent formation with Bhima and Arjuna {{at the head of the}} right and the left horns, respectively. The Kauravas concentrated their attack on Arjuna's position. Arjuna's chariot was soon covered with arrows and javelins. Arjuna, with amazing skill, built a fortification around his chariot with <b>an</b> <b>unending</b> stream of arrows from his bow. Abhimanyu and Satyaki combined to defeat the Gandhara forces of Shakuni. Bhima and his son Ghatotkacha attacked Duryodhana in the rear. Bhima's arrows hit Duryodhana, who swooned in his chariot. His charioteer immediately drove them out of danger. Duryodhana's forces, however, saw their leader fleeing the battlefield and soon scattered. Bhishma soon restored order and Duryodhana returned to lead the army. He was angry at Bhishma, however, at what he saw as leniency towards the five Pandava brothers and spoke harshly at his commander. Bhishma, stung by this unfair charge, fell on the Pandava army with renewed vigor. It was as if there were more than one Bhishma on the field.|$|E
