5|$|Both the {{guillemot}} tick Ixodes uriae and {{the flea}} Ornithopsylla laetitiae (probably originally <b>a</b> <b>rabbit</b> flea) {{have been recorded}} from the nests of puffins. Other fleas which have been found on the birds include Ceratophyllus borealis, Ceratophyllus gallinae, Ceratophyllus garei, Ceratophyllus vagabunda and the common rabbit flea Spilopsyllus cuniculi.|$|E

At first Hazel's group are {{relieved}} to finally {{be able to sleep}} and feed well – all except for Fiver who senses only death there. When Bigwig is nearly killed in a snare, the group realize that the new warren is managed by a farmer who protects and feeds the rabbits, but also harvests a number of them for their meat and skins. The residents of the new warren are simply using Hazel and the others to increase their own odds of survival. Fiver {{and the rest of the}} group work together to rescue Bigwig from a snare, then continue on their journey, along with <b>a</b> <b>rabbit</b> from the new warren called Strawberry, who asks to join them after his doe is killed in a snare.|$|E
5|$|In 1726, anatomist Nathaniel St André {{claimed to}} have {{delivered}} rabbits from Mary Toft, a woman who lived at No.27 Leicester Square. The event was widely reported around London, attracting interest from King George I and Royal Society president Hans Sloane. Shortly afterwards, the woman was caught trying to buy <b>a</b> <b>rabbit</b> in secret, and the incident was uncovered as a hoax.|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} kinds of free {{amino-acids}} in the brain, {{most of which are}} glutamic acid, glutamine, asparatic acid. asparagine, γ-aminobutyric acid etc. The author has investigated the influences of these amino-acids upon the glucose metabolism in the brain of the normal and the cerebral local anaphylactic (C.

L. <b>A.</b> <b>rabbits,</b> aspartic acid and asparagine accelerate that of glucose in the C. L. <b>A.</b> <b>rabbits,</b> while they have no influence on that in the normal. It is clarified that all of these amino-acids have the function to restore the decreased utilization of glucose in the C. L. <b>A.</b> <b>rabbits</b> to more than the normal level...|$|R

5|$|Sebaceous {{adenitis}} is an {{autoimmune disease}} that affects sebaceous glands. It is mainly known {{to occur in}} dogs, particularly poodles and akitas, where it {{is thought to be}} generally autosomal recessively inherited. It has also been described in cats, and one report describes this condition in <b>a</b> <b>rabbit.</b> In these animals, it causes hair loss, though the nature and distribution of the hair loss differs greatly.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{idea for the}} short was a magician who incorporated <b>a</b> <b>rabbit</b> into his act who suffered from stage fright. This {{was considered to be}} too long and complicated, and the idea was reworked. To design the theater featured in Presto, the filmmakers visited several opera houses and theaters for set design ideas. Problems arose when trying to animate the theater's audience of 2,500 patrons; this was deemed too expensive, and was solved by showing the back of the audience.|$|E
5|$|The strip {{centers on}} the mixed {{marriage}} between <b>a</b> <b>rabbit,</b> Kevin and a grey wolf, Kell Dewclaw. In their society, their major difference is their diet: Kevin is a herbivore and Kell is a carnivore. Their family includes three children: Lindesfarne, a hedgehog adopted from Kevin's first marriage; Rudy, a wolf/fox hybrid born during Kell's first marriage; and their only biological child Coney, a carnivorous rabbit. The comic's plot revolves around species-related humor, satire, and interpersonal conflict.|$|E
5|$|About {{the size}} of <b>a</b> <b>rabbit,</b> the tammar is among the {{smallest}} of the wallabies in the genus Macropus. Its coat colour is largely grey. The tammar has several notable adaptations, including the ability to retain energy while hopping, colour vision and the ability to drink seawater. A nocturnal species, it spends nighttime in grassland habitat and daytime in shrubland. It is also very gregarious and has a seasonal, promiscuous mating pattern. A female tammar can nurse a joey in her pouch while keeping an embryo in her uterus. The tammar is a model species for research on marsupials, and on mammals in general. It is one of many organisms to have had its genome sequenced.|$|E

5|$|Bunnies & Burrows has the {{advantage}} of offering players an intuitive grasp of relative dangers and appropriate actions not possible in game worlds that are substantially fictional. For example, a player is told their character is confronted with a fox. There is an immediate intuition on the amount of peril <b>a</b> <b>rabbit</b> is facing. Although player characters are substantially weaker than many of the dangers they face, the game {{is one of the first}} to encourage problem solving and outwitting obstacles, rather than out-fighting them.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its small}} size, the least weasel is a fierce hunter, capable of killing <b>a</b> <b>rabbit</b> {{five to ten}} times its own weight. Although they are {{commonly}} taken, the rabbits are usually young specimens, and become an important food source during the spring, when small rodents are scarce and rabbit kits are plentiful. Male least weasels take {{a higher proportion of}} rabbits than females, as well as an overall greater variety of prey. This is linked to the fact that being larger, and having vaster territorial ranges than females, males have more opportunities to hunt a greater diversity of prey.|$|E

5|$|GoldenEye was edited to be {{guaranteed}} a PG-13 rating from the MPAA and a 12 rating from the BBFC. The cuts included the visible bullet impact to Trevelyan's head {{when he is}} shot in the prologue, several additional deaths during the sequence in which Onatopp guns down the workers at the Severnaya station, more explicit footage and violent behaviour in the Admiral's death, extra footage of Onatopp's death, and Bond giving her <b>a</b> <b>rabbit</b> punch in the car. In 2006, the film was re-mastered and re-edited for the James Bond Ultimate Edition DVD in which the BBFC cuts were restored, causing the rating to be changed to 15. However, the original MPAA edits still remain.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{exist in}} an {{alternate}} Domain, and {{are referred to}} as creatures with no natural defenses. Most believe that they are fictional creatures; but a few, including the Dewclaws, know that they exist. This was developed further in 2003 by the introduction of the character Danielle, a human who enters the animal world via the Bermuda Triangle and transforms into <b>a</b> <b>rabbit.</b> However, she later has a son, Francis, who is born human. The series features jokes on a variety of topics. Many draw satirical parallels between its world and ours, making fun and sometimes social commentary on politics, sports, society, class-snobbery, school, technology, pop culture and corporate culture, for example; in January 2008 the Predator's Union was described as going on strike, in a parody of the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, Potter revised a {{tale about}} <b>a</b> <b>rabbit</b> named Peter {{she had written}} for a child in 1893, and {{prepared}} a dummy book of it in imitation of Helen Bannerman's 1889 best-seller The Story of Little Black Sambo. Unable to find a buyer, she published the book {{for family and friends}} at her own expense in December 1901. Frederick Warne & Co. had earlier rejected the tale, but, anxious to compete in the booming small format children's book market, reconsidered and accepted it following the recommendation of their prominent children's book artist L. Leslie Brooke. Potter agreed to colour the pen and ink illustrations of the private edition, and chose the then-new Hentschel three-colour process for reproducing her watercolours. On 2 October 1902 The Tale of Peter Rabbit was released.|$|E

5|$|In July 2008, the Amami Rangers {{for nature}} {{conservation}} obtained {{a photograph of}} a feral cat carrying <b>a</b> <b>rabbit</b> corpse (rabbit bones and fur found in cat or dog droppings had already been found), prompting discussions on better ways to control pets. A small area of the Amami Island has the Amami Gunto Quasi-National Park that further protects the population. Some attempt at habitat restoration has been made, but the Amami rabbit needs a mosaic of mature and young forest in close proximity, and when a young forest is regrown nowhere near a mature forest, this rabbit is not likely to inhabit it. Research and population monitoring also is underway to try to keep the numbers from declining, even if they can not be increased.|$|E

Ben informs Sawyer that they fitted him, like the rabbit, with a modified pacemaker; should his heart rate reach 140, his heart would explode.
