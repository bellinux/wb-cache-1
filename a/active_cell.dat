25|$|A {{disregulation}} of {{the cell}} cycle components may lead to tumor formation. As mentioned above, when some genes like the cell cycle inhibitors, RB, p53 etc. mutate, they may cause the cell to multiply uncontrollably, forming a tumor. Although the duration of cell cycle in tumor cells is equal to or longer than that of normal cell cycle, the proportion of cells that are in <b>active</b> <b>cell</b> division (versus quiescent cells in G0 phase) in tumors {{is much higher than}} that in normal tissue. Thus there is a net increase in cell number as the number of cells that die by apoptosis or senescence remains the same.|$|E
25|$|Human skin {{has a low}} permeability; that is, most foreign {{substances}} {{are unable}} to penetrate and diffuse through the skin. Skin's outermost layer, the stratum corneum, is an effective barrier to most inorganic nanosized particles. This protects the body from external particles such as toxins by not allowing them to {{come into contact with}} internal tissues. However, in some cases it is desirable to allow particles entry to the body through the skin. Potential medical applications of such particle transfer has prompted developments in nanomedicine and biology to increase skin permeability. One application of transcutaneous particle delivery could be to locate and treat cancer. Nanomedical researchers seek to target the epidermis and other layers of <b>active</b> <b>cell</b> division where nanoparticles can interact directly with cells that have lost their growth-control mechanisms (cancer cells). Such direct interaction could be used to more accurately diagnose properties of specific tumors or to treat them by delivering drugs with cellular specificity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} novel Persistent OcTree (POT) {{indexing}} structure for accelerating isosurface extraction and spatial filtering from volumetric data. This data structure efficiently handles {{a wide range}} of visualization problems such as the generation of viewdependent isosurfaces, ray tracing, and isocontour slicing for high dimensional data. POT {{can be viewed as a}} hybrid data structure between the interval tree and the Branch-On-Need Octree (BONO) in the sense that it achieves the asymptotic bound of the interval tree for identifying the <b>active</b> <b>cells</b> corresponding to an isosurface and is more efficient than BONO for handling spatial queries. We encode a compact octree for each isovalue. Each such octree contains only the corresponding <b>active</b> <b>cells,</b> in such a way that the combined structure has linear space. The inherent hierarchical structure associated with the <b>active</b> <b>cells</b> enables very fast filtering of the <b>active</b> <b>cells</b> based on spatial constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing view-dependent isosurfacing on a wide variety of volumetric data sets and 4 D isocontour slicing on the time-varying Richtmyer-Meshkov instability dataset.

40|$|The {{relative}} heterotrophic {{activity of}} marine microorganisms was determined at two sites by the heterotrophic uptake technique throughout the water column, the sediment-water interface, {{and the surface}} layer of sediment. In the water column, uptake was greatest at the surface and steadily decreased with depth. The percentage of the substrate that was respired also decreased with depth from 69 to 56 %. The activity of the sediment-water interface was several orders of magnitude {{greater than that of}} the overlying water and twice that of the sediment immediately below. Hand-collected water samples carefully taken as close as 1 cm from the sediment-water interface had the same characteristically low activity as the bottom few meters of water. Microautoradiography with 3 H-labeled glucose, glutamic acid, or thymidine revealed a general decrease in the percentage of <b>active</b> <b>cells</b> with depth from 35 to < 1 %. The number of <b>active</b> <b>cells</b> in the interface and sediment averaged < 10 % of the total population. The data indicate that the sediment-water interface is the most active region in this system due to an increased number of <b>active</b> <b>cells</b> rather than an increased percentage of <b>active</b> <b>cells</b> or increased per-cell activity...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the susceptibility of <b>active</b> and dormant <b>cell</b> populations from Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms to non-antibiotic antimicrobial agents such as chlorine, hydrogen peroxide and silver ions in comparison with antibiotics. Methods: <b>Active</b> <b>cells</b> in colony biofilm were differentially labelled by induction of a green fluorescent protein (GFP). <b>Active</b> and dormant <b>cells</b> were sorted in phosphate buffered solution by flow cytometry. Reductions in viability were determined with plate counts. Results: The spatial pattern of metabolic activity in colony biofilm was verified, and the <b>active</b> and dormant <b>cells</b> were successfully sorted according to the GFP intensity. <b>Active</b> <b>cells</b> had bigger cell size and higher intracellular density than dormant cells. While dormant cells were more tolerant to tobramycin and silver ions, <b>active</b> <b>cells</b> were more tolerant to chlorine. Metabolically <b>active</b> <b>cells</b> contain denser intracellular components that can react with highly reactive oxidants such as chlorine, thereby reducing the available concentrations of chlorine. In contrast, the concentrations of silver ions and hydrogen peroxide were constant during treatment. Aerobically grown stationary cells were signifi-cantly more tolerant to chlorine unlike other antimicrobial agents. Conclusions: Chlorine was more effective in inactivation of metabolically inactive dormant cells and also more effective under anaerobic conditions. The high oxidative reactivity and rapid decay of chlor-ine might influence the different antimicrobial actions of chlorine compared with antibiotics. This study contributes to understanding the effects of dormancy and the presence of oxygen on the sus-ceptibility of P. aeruginosa biofilm to a wide range of antimicrobial agents...|$|R
40|$|Many {{networks}} in the mammalian nervous system remain active {{in the absence of}} stimuli. This activity falls into two main patterns: steady firing at low rates and rhythmic bursting. How are these firing patterns generated? Specifically, how do dynamic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons produce these firing patterns, and how do networks switch from one firing pattern to the other? We investigated these questions theoretically by examining the intrinsic dynamics of large networks of neurons. Using both a semianalytic model based on mean firing rate dynamics and simulations with large neuronal networks, we found that the dynamics, and thus the firing patterns, are controlled largely by one parameter, the fraction of endogenously <b>active</b> <b>cells.</b> When no endogenously <b>active</b> <b>cells</b> are present, networks are either silent or fire at a high rate; as the number of endogenously <b>active</b> <b>cells</b> increases, there is a transition to bursting; and, with a further increase, there is a second transition to steady firing at a low rate. A secondary role is played by network connectivity, which determines whether activity occurs at a constant mean firing rate or oscillates around that mean. These conclusions require only conventional assumptions: excitatory input to a neuron increases its firing rate, inhibitory input decreases it, and neurons exhibit spike-frequency adaptation. These conclusions also lead to two experimentally testable predictions: 1) isolated networks that fire at low rates must contain endogenously <b>active</b> <b>cells</b> and 2) a reduction in the fraction of endogenously <b>active</b> <b>cells</b> in such networks must lead to bursting...|$|R

How these firing patterns are maintained in the presence of powerful recurrent excitation, and how networks switch between them, is not well understood. In the previous paper, we addressed these issues theoretically; in this paper we address them experimentally. We found in both studies that a key parameter in controlling firing patterns is the fraction of endogenously <b>active</b> <b>cells.</b> The theoretical analysis indicated that steady firing rates are possible only when the fraction of endogenously <b>active</b> <b>cells</b> is above some threshold, that there is a transition to bursting when it falls below that threshold, and that networks becomes silent when the fraction drops to zero. Experimentally, we found that all steadily firing cultures contain endogenously <b>active</b> <b>cells,</b> and that reducing the fraction of such cells in steadily firing cultures causes a transition to bursting. The latter finding implies indirectly that the elimination of endogenously <b>active</b> <b>cells</b> would cause a permanent drop to zero firing rate.
