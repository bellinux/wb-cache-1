5|$|Open-weave {{glass fiber}} grids {{are used to}} {{reinforce}} <b>asphalt</b> pavement. Non-woven glass fiber/polymer blend mats are used saturated with <b>asphalt</b> emulsion and overlaid with <b>asphalt,</b> producing a waterproof, crack-resistant membrane. Use of glass-fiber reinforced polymer rebar instead of steel rebar shows promise in areas where avoidance of steel corrosion is desired.|$|E
5|$|In autumn 2011, North Michigan Avenue was {{completely}} repaved from the Chicago River to Oak Street with a durable stone-matrix <b>asphalt</b> pavement mix that incorporated {{high levels of}} recycled materials, including waste shingles, ground tire rubber, and <b>asphalt</b> millings, diverting some 800 tons of material from landfills. The $1 million project was completed without ever completely halting traffic on the street. In July 2012, the City of Chicago and CDOT were honored with the Environmental Leadership Award from the National <b>Asphalt</b> Pavement Association.|$|E

30|$|The above {{analysis}} {{indicates that}} carbonaceous <b>asphalts,</b> bituminous <b>asphalts</b> and colloidal <b>asphalts</b> were formed {{due to the}} strong uplift and erosion, which reflected the early oil and gas injection phase, while {{the oil and gas}} injected in the late period were not subjected to alteration and showed mostly oleaginous <b>asphalts.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the test results}} of penetration test, softening point test and Moriyoshi Breaking Point test for new <b>asphalts</b> and <b>asphalts</b> recovered from various fields. Flow and cracking of flexible pavements depend upon the brittle point of <b>asphalts,</b> but research of those points have not been conducted. It is concluded that scattering of brittle point of <b>asphalts</b> for new and recovered <b>asphalts</b> was remarkably large {{and it seems that}} those points controlled various crackings of flexible pavements. 技術報...|$|R

5|$|Since {{the early}} 20th century, {{excavations}} at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles have yielded 100 tonnes of fossils from 600 species of flora and fauna, including several Columbian mammoths. Many of the fossils are {{the remains of}} animals that became stuck in <b>asphalt</b> puddles which seeped {{to the surface of}} the pits, 40,000 to 11,500 years ago. Dust and leaves likely concealed the liquid <b>asphalt,</b> which then trapped unwary animals. Mired animals died from hunger or exhaustion; their corpses attracted predators, which sometimes became stuck themselves. The tar pits' fossil record is dominated by the remains of predators, such as large canids and felids. Fossils of different animals are found stuck together when they are excavated from the pits. The tar pits do not preserve soft tissue, and a 2014 study concluded that <b>asphalt</b> may degrade the DNA of animals mired in it after an attempt was made to extract DNA from a Columbian mammoth.|$|E

5|$|Albertite, {{a type of}} <b>asphalt,</b> {{was first}} found in Albert County in 1849 by the Canadian {{geologist}} Abraham Gesner, inventor of kerosene. Over 200,000tonnes of the mineral were shipped to Boston within 30 years. Large deposits of gypsum found eight kilometres (five miles) from the mining site were shipped around the globe as well.

30|$|When the {{temperature}} of crude oil is over 150  °C, it will become unstable, macromolecular hydrocarbons and other heterocyclic compounds will be gradually transformed into low molecular compounds (condensate and gas hydrocarbon) and <b>asphalts</b> (Guo et al. 2008). The representative geothermal gradient in the Dongpu Depression is 3.4  °C/ 100  m (Liu et al. 2007 a, b). The corresponding depth to reach {{the temperature}} of crude oil cracking is about 4400  m. But most of the carbonaceous <b>asphalts</b> observed {{in the study area}} did not reach this depth and were not of pyrolytic origin. However, <b>asphalts</b> in the deep reservoir could be formed by oil cracking.|$|R

5|$|In 1999, the {{granular}} pavement {{section of}} Highway 2 south of Watrous was tested {{with a cold}} in-place recycling or “CIR” method to rehabilitate highways.

This pulverized material is mixed with <b>asphalt</b> emulsion and spread and compacted back onto the highway surface. This surface is then recovered with a new seal dependent on traffic volume.|$|E

40|$|Nine <b>asphalts,</b> {{including}} seven Strategic Highway Research Program <b>asphalts</b> and two Texas <b>asphalts,</b> were aged {{at several}} conditions of temperature and oxygen pressure {{to develop an}} aging test. Values for a dynamic shear rheometer function, {{a combination of both}} elastic and viscous properties that serves as an indicator of susceptibility to age-related pavement cracking, were measured for both aged and unaged samples. Each aging condition was ranked and calibrated against environmental room aging (60 °C, 1 atm air), used to simulate road aging. PAV thin-film aging at 90 °C, 20 atm air for 32 hr best represented environmental room aging. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
