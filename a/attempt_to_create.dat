5|$|Club {{competitions}} between {{teams from}} different European countries can trace their origins {{as far back}} as 1897, when the Challenge Cup was created for clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, who did not meet under normal circumstances. The Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy, named after entrepreneur and sportsman Thomas Lipton, was established in 1909 and was contested between clubs from Italy, Great Britain, Germany and Switzerland; the competition lasted for two years. The earliest <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a cup for national champion clubs of Europe was made by Swiss club FC Servette. Founded in 1930, the Coupe des Nations featured clubs of ten major European football leagues and was deemed a success. Due to financial reasons, the competition was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|During gameplay, players <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> goal-scoring {{opportunities}} through {{individual control}} of the ball, such as by dribbling, passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain {{control of the}} ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.|$|E

5|$|During the 2008 United States presidential election, {{like most}} of the New York State Democratic establishment, Brown was a {{supporter}} of Hillary Clinton, the United States Senator from New York.

He even ran to be a delegate for Clinton at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. In July 2008, Golisano announced that he would <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> change in Albany by spending $5million on targeted campaigns.

5|$|Early during Kosygin's tenure, the Brezhnev–Kosygin <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> {{stability}} {{was failing}} on various fronts. From 1969 to 1970 discontent within the Soviet leadership {{had grown to}} such an extent that some started to doubt both former and current Soviet policies. Examples include the handling of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia (which Kosygin initially resisted), the decline in agriculture production, the Sino–Soviet border conflict (he advocated restraint), the Vietnam War, and the Soviet–American talks on the limitation of strategic missiles. Two summit conferences between the US and the USSR were held: the Warsaw Pact Summit Conference and the Moscow Summit Conference; both failed to gain support for Soviet policies.|$|E
