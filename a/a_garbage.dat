5|$|Homer and Marge, on the {{way back}} from an {{orchestra}} performance, pass through a seedy part of town. Marge cautions Homer, but gets enticed by Snake's Three-card Monte game. Snake cheats Homer out of $20, but Marge exposes the con and Snake takes off. After giving chase, Marge knocks Snake unconscious with <b>a</b> <b>garbage</b> can lid, giving her a sense of exhilaration. Finding her everyday routine dull and boring, she decides to join the Springfield police force, despite Homer's concerns.|$|E
5|$|The Foreign Minister's {{interpreter}} is ghost-hacked, {{presumably to}} assassinate VIPs {{in an upcoming}} meeting. Believing the perpetrator is the mysterious Puppet Master, Kusanagi's team follows the traced telephone calls that sent the virus. After a chase, they capture <b>a</b> <b>garbage</b> man and a thug.

5|$|Aliens do not {{feature in}} the series, as Grant and Naylor decided {{very early in the}} process that they did not want aliens involved. This is usually {{addressed}} with Rimmer's belief in extraterrestrial life being shot down, such as a vessel he believes to be an alien ship turning out to be <b>a</b> <b>garbage</b> pod. However, there are non-human life forms such as evolutions of Earth species (e.g. the Cat race), robotic or holo-life forms created by humans, and a kind of 'Genetically Engineered Life Form' (GELF), an artificially-created creature. Simulants and GELFs frequently serve as antagonists among the later series of the show.|$|E
5|$|As Remy watches {{through the}} window, {{a young man}} named Alfredo Linguini is hired as <b>a</b> <b>garbage</b> boy by Skinner, the restaurant's {{paranoid}} current owner and Gusteau's former sous-chef. When Linguini spills a pot of soup and attempts to recreate it, Remy recognizes that he is ruining it instead, and repairs Linguini's mistakes. Linguini catches Remy but hides him when he is then confronted by Skinner for tampering with the soup. As the two argue, the soup is accidentally served and proves to be a success. The Chefs convince Skinner to retain Linguini, who is assumed to be the soup's creator. When Skinner catches Remy trying to escape, he orders Linguini to kill the rat, but Linguini discovers Remy's intelligence and decides to keep him instead.|$|E

5|$|At the Springfield Derby, Duncan {{wins the}} race. Enraged, the furious jockeys chase after Homer and Bart {{wielding}} swords to hunt {{them down and}} destroy them. With the help of Marge and Lisa, who spray water on the jockeys with a hose, Homer is able to put the jockeys into <b>a</b> <b>garbage</b> bag and get them sent to the dump. Afterwards, Homer and Bart prepare for Duncan's retirement from racing {{to start a new}} life as a stud. President Clinton then shows up at the Simpsons's house to see Lisa, presenting her with a plaque. Clinton says that Ogdenville was wrong to use glowsticks and that Springfield Elementary's band is the true champion.|$|E
5|$|Carol buys a car, and the McCoys {{drive to}} an {{electronics}} store. As Doc buys a portable radio, he switches {{off the television}} set near the proprietor's desk broadcasting {{the news of the}} earlier incidents they were involved in. Suddenly, all the television sets in the store show Doc's picture, prompting him to leave immediately. The proprietor gets a glimpse of the picture, and calls the police. Doc steals a shotgun, followed by several shoot-outs and police chases. The couple escape by hiding in a large trash bin, only to end up in the back of <b>a</b> <b>garbage</b> truck that dumps its load at the local landfill. Filthy and frustrated, they argue about whether to stay together or split up. They decide to see things through.|$|E
5|$|Martin {{was also}} wanted in San Francisco in the United States {{for the murder}} of {{homosexual}} prostitute Tom Wenger on 28 March 1994. Wenger's body was chopped up and drained of blood; it was found in <b>a</b> <b>garbage</b> skip (dumpster) in Myrte Alley in the Polk Street district. Martin's photograph matched a facial composite picture of a suspect made by San Francisco police, but he was formally eliminated as a suspect after it was established that he was living in a British halfway house {{at the time of the}} murder. He was also investigated for another murder in Arizona.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) discovers a bat in the ceiling. It flies {{through the}} office, sending the {{employees}} scurrying for cover. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Karen Filippelli exploit Dwight's paranoia, and pretend that Jim was bitten by the bat and {{is turning into}} a vampire. Jim calls animal control, but Dwight insists on catching the bat himself even after 5:00 passes and the other employees go home, save Meredith who continues {{to hide in the}} breakroom for fear of the bat. Dwight eventually catches the bat with <b>a</b> <b>garbage</b> bag after it lands on Meredith's head.|$|E
5|$|Suicide {{came to be}} {{regarded}} as a sin in Christian Europe and was condemned at the Council of Arles in 452 as the work of the Devil. In the Middle Ages, the Church had drawn-out discussions as to when the desire for martyrdom was suicidal, {{as in the case of}} martyrs of Córdoba. Despite these disputes and occasional official rulings, Catholic doctrine was not entirely settled on the subject of suicide until the later 17th century. A criminal ordinance issued by Louis XIV of France in 1670 was extremely severe, even for the times: the dead person's body was drawn through the streets, face down, and then hung or thrown on <b>a</b> <b>garbage</b> heap. Additionally, all of the person's property was confiscated.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his career}} von Stroheim used {{grotesque}} imagery and characters. This is most {{apparent in the}} wedding-banquet scene, which includes a midget, a hunchback, a woman with buck teeth and a boy on crutches. The wedding guests violently and crudely devour their meal like animals. This scene was unlike any other in films of that period, which treated meals with dignity {{and a sense of}} communion. Other instances of grotesque imagery include Trina's fingers becoming infected and amputated. Von Stroheim contrasted love scenes between McTeague and Trina with their ugly, lower-class environment, such as the sewer with the dead rat and <b>a</b> <b>garbage</b> truck driving by as they kiss.|$|E

5|$|Woody {{returns to}} Sunnyside and learns from a Chatter Telephone toy {{that there is}} only one way out of the daycare: the trash. Woody and Andy's other toys execute their plan, but accidentally reset Buzz to Spanish mode instead of his old persona. Buzz {{promptly}} allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster, but are cornered by Lotso and his gang. As <b>a</b> <b>garbage</b> truck approaches, Woody reveals what he learned about Lotso and shows proof of Daisy's ownership tag, which Chuckles had kept, to Big Baby. Lotso destroys the tag and says that toys are meant to be discarded, but an enraged Big Baby throws Lotso into the dumpster. As the toys try to leave, Lotso pulls Woody into the dumpster just as the truck collects the trash. The rest of Andy's toys fall into the back of the truck while trying to rescue him, and a falling television lands on Buzz, restoring his memory and normal personality. The truck deposits the toys at a landfill, where they find themselves on a conveyor belt, leading to an incinerator. Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency stop button, only for Lotso to abandon them and escape. The toys resign themselves to their fate, but are soon rescued by the Aliens operating an industrial claw. Lotso is found by <b>a</b> <b>garbage</b> truck driver, who straps him to his truck's radiator grill, and drives away. Woody and the other toys board another garbage truck back to Andy's house.|$|E
5|$|Agents Scully and Doggett {{investigate}} the crash. Scully suggests a man {{stopped the car}} but Doggett points out {{that it would have}} required a dense block of steel to stop the car. Nora Pearce appears and asks what happened to Curtis Delario. Soon afterwards, Scully finds Delario’s body left in <b>a</b> <b>garbage</b> can nearby; his face has gaping holes in it. Autopsying the remains, Scully concludes that the five holes in the man’s face were made by human fingers, as someone reached into Delario’s head and pulled him out of the wrecked vehicle. Doggett finds a fresh fingerprint with the blood of Ray. Agent Doggett goes to see Nora Pearce and finds Harry Odell, who employed Ray Pearce at his salvage yard. Doggett asks about Ray, but Nora insists she saw Ray die; both do not believe Ray could be involved in Curtis’s death.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the game}} was never completed, {{only a small portion}} of the {{intended}} gameplay exists. During the playable segment, Mustafa, through conversations with other detainees, discovers that another detainee is planning an escape but needs a pair of pliers to make the attempt. Mustafa must join a work detail to gain access to the pliers, hide the pliers in <b>a</b> <b>garbage</b> can to prevent them from being found during a search, recover them at night (which requires Mustafa to find a way to pry open the area that the garbage cans are stored in), and deliver them to the other detainee. The playable section ends when Mustafa delivers the pliers. Other interactions during the playable section include speaking with a detainee who, after complaining that a guard threw her copy of the Quran to the ground, mentions the existence of a partially built tunnel from a previous escape attempt.|$|E

5|$|Blake {{tries to}} shoot West with a shotgun, but the blasts {{do not stop}} West, who throws the sheriff over the railing into power lines, killing him. West hits Nelson and knocks him over the railing, leaving the doctor hanging on the side. Nelson appeals to West, {{reminding}} him that they were friends, and West decides to pull Nelson to safety. Two armed security guards then arrive and, in a panic, fatally shoot Nelson in the face {{as he tries to}} protect West. An infuriated West kills the security guards and stumbles away. After collapsing against the side of a building, he slowly melts completely away. The next morning, a janitor finds his gory remains and casually mops them into <b>a</b> <b>garbage</b> can. The film ends with a radio news report about another astronaut team being sent to Saturn.|$|E
5|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the gas station, the crew rented out a 7-11 for a day. When Hurley drove in, the van was actually being pushed instead of driven to eliminate any sound from the vehicle. However, every time the van was pushed it would stall or the timing would be off. Once that problem had been solved, it started to rain, but eventually it stopped and the crew {{was able to get}} the shots before ending shooting at midnight. Hurley's dream scene was shot in the Hawaii Film Studio, where the hatch had been constructed. After each take of Hurley eating food in the hatch, the old food would be replaced with newer food. Garcia did not actually eat all the food though, he would sometimes just chew it and then spit it out into <b>a</b> <b>garbage</b> can. The chicken head that Bose had to wear was extremely heavy, causing actor Daniel Dae Kim to have to hold it up while Bose delivered his lines.|$|E
5|$|Gordon escapes the {{destroyed}} lab. Surviving staff {{tell him}} that communications {{with the outside world}} have been cut and urge him to head to the surface. Gordon fights his way through Black Mesa, defending himself against hostile Xen creatures — such as Vortigaunts and parasitic headcrabs, which attach themselves to human hosts — and US marines sent to cover up the incident. At the surface, Gordon learns that scientists from the Lambda Complex may have a way to close the portal. Gordon travels {{to the other end of}} the facility to assist them. Along the way, he activates a rocket engine test facility to destroy a giant tentacled creature and uses a disused railway system to reach and launch a satellite rocket. After he is captured by Black Ops and left for dead in <b>a</b> <b>garbage</b> compactor, he escapes and makes his way to an older part of the facility, where he discovers Xen specimens collected before the resonance cascade.|$|E

50|$|Computer {{scientists}} have also discovered ways {{to detect and}} collect reference cycles automatically, without requiring changes in the data structure design. One simple solution is to periodically use <b>a</b> tracing <b>garbage</b> collector to reclaim cycles; since cycles typically constitute a relatively small amount of reclaimed space, the collector can be run much less often than with <b>an</b> ordinary tracing <b>garbage</b> collector.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} <b>a</b> {{scheme for}} <b>garbage</b> collection suitable for hard real-time applications.

The results confirms that high-priority processes can be guaranteed sub-millisecond response times and meet tight deadlines...|$|R
