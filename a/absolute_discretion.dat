40|$|Roncarelli {{is remembered}} {{fifty years later}} {{particularly}} because of Justice Rand 2 ̆ 7 s now iconic statement that 2 ̆ 2 {{there is no such}} thing as <b>absolute</b> and untrammelled <b>discretion.</b> 2 ̆ 2 Justice Rand defined 2 ̆ 2 untrammelled discretion 2 ̆ 2 as circumstances where action can be taken on any ground or for any reason that can be suggested to the mind of the decision maker. This statement has been understood to mean that all public regulation exercised through discretionary decision-making by executive officials has legal boundaries, and that the role of the courts is to ensure that decisions do not exceed those boundaries. In this paper, the author explores several areas of public regulation in Canada that remain 2 ̆ 2 untrammelled 2 ̆ 2. These areas include realms of government action deemed to be nonjusticiable, such as decisions involving foreign relations or the conferral of honours. The author argues that areas of untrammelled discretion are inconsistent with the Supreme Court of Canada 2 ̆ 7 s reasoning in Roncarelli. To complete the unfinished project of Roncarelli, the author argues that all discretionary decisions should be understood to have justiciable elements, which include, at a minimum, a requirement that public power be exercised in good faith. The author concludes by highlighting that while approaching all discretionary authority as justiciable is intended to alter the approach of Canadian public law, Roncarelli 2 ̆ 7 s project is as much a political project as a legal one...|$|R

25|$|On {{the fifth}} day of the enquiry, {{managing}} director of Imperial Airways Colonel Frank Searle gave evidence that Imperial Airways pilots had <b>absolute</b> <b>discretion</b> to refuse to fly any aircraft if, in their opinion, the aircraft was unfit for flight for whatever reason. He stated that the petrol pipe supplied by Petro-Flex to Imperial Airways was of an armoured type, but that unarmoured pipes had been fitted to some aircraft taken over when Imperial Airways had been formed, and that spares from these companies were in stock and being used. Both armoured and unarmoured pipes had been approved {{for use by the}} Air Ministry. A representative from Petro-Flex corroborated Searle's evidence in respect of the type of piping supplied to Imperial Airways.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{hitherto}} unexamined phenomenon of queer-care {{in higher education}} from the teacher educators' perspectives. While care in education {{has been the subject}} of scholarly interest for many years and demonstrating caring for the wellbeing of students is an important component of teaching, the lack of attention to queer-care is a significant oversight in the body of care research and teacher education. Pertinent to this study is the investigation of how well Noddings' enactments of care (modeling, dialogue, practice, and confirmation) address the care needs of queer students. Four teacher educators shared stories of their efforts to care for the emotional wellbeing of their queer students. As the fifth teacher educator in this work, I investigate my journey to becoming a queer-care practitioner, and my own practice of queer-care. The theoretical frameworks of qualitative and phenomenological research and feminist theory undergird this study. Two processes of analysis were employed, the first being the key sensitizing concepts of Noddings' enactments of care as points of entry into an understanding of the teacher educators' narratives of queer-care. The second level of analysis used the insights so gleaned to guide the focus of the self-study undertaken in this work. Analysis of the teacher educators' narratives indicates that the practice of queer-care, while sharing certain similarities, is idiosyncratic, complicated, lonely, and often exhausting work. Alongside these findings are indicators that queer-care as practiced by these teacher educators is welcomed by queer students as being all too rare in their university experience, and of benefit to their sense of wellbeing. Findings also reveal that Noddings' enactments of care neither include nor address the particular care needs of queer students. This led me to identify particular care needs of queer students as being those of unwavering <b>discretion,</b> <b>absolute</b> safety, full social membership, and unstinting succour. This necessary awareness expands Noddings' model of care allowing it to include and be responsive to queer students. This research has implications for teacher educators and any educators concerned with the wellbeing of queer students. It provides suggestions to enrich caring practice in teacher education programs and field experience...|$|R

2500|$|Resolution to {{the dispute}} came in June 2005, {{after more than}} a year's delay. By April 2005, a {{majority}} of the city council had come to support the Williams proposal, and the council planned to approve the Williams plan on May 4. But Cropp convinced the council to put off the vote, arguing that the bill still gave the mayor <b>absolute</b> <b>discretion</b> over where to build a convention headquarters hotel. Williams submitted a revised agreement on May 24, and the council unanimously approved a plan to redevelop the old convention center site on June 6, 2005.

2500|$|Domestically, {{the federal}} government's {{sovereignty}} {{means that it}} may perform acts such as entering into contracts or accepting bonds, which are typical of governmental entities but not expressly provided for in the Constitution or laws. Similarly, the federal government, as an attribute of sovereignty, {{has the power to}} enforce those powers that are granted to it (e.g., the power to [...] "establish Post Offices and Post Roads" [...] includes the power to punish those who interfere with the postal system so established). The Court has recognized the federal government's supreme power over those limited matters entrusted to it. Thus, no state may interfere with the federal government's operations as though its sovereignty is superior to the federal government's (discussed more below); for example, states may not interfere with the federal government's near <b>absolute</b> <b>discretion</b> to sell its own real property, even when that real property is located in one or another state. The federal government exercises its supreme power not as a unitary entity, but instead via the three coordinate branches of the government (legislative, executive, and judicial), each of which has its own prescribed powers and limitations under the Constitution. In addition, the doctrine of separation of powers functions as a limitation on each branch of the federal government's exercise of sovereign power.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Gladstone’s ceaseless {{attention}} to the many phases of the struggle that was now the centre of his public life, was especially engaged on what remains the most amazing of them. I wish it were possible to pass it over, or throw it into a secondary place; {{but it is too}} closely connected with the progress of Mr. Gladstone’s Irish policy in British opinion at a critical stage, and it is still the subject of too many perversions that affect his name. Transactions {{are to be found in}} our annals where wrong was done by government to individuals on a greater scale, where a powerful majority devised engines for the proscription of a weak minority with deadlier aim, and where the omnipotence of parliament was abused for the purpose of faction with more ruthless result.
