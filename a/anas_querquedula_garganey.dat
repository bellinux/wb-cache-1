5000|$|The first formal {{description}} of the Garganey was by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae. He introduced the binomial name <b>Anas</b> <b>querquedula.</b> A molecular phylogentic study comparing mitochondrial DNA sequences published in 2009 found that the genus Anas, as then defined, was non-monophyletic. [...] The genus was subsequently split into four monophyletic genera with ten species including the Garganey moved into the resurrected genus Spatula. This genus had been originally proposed by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1822. The name Spatula is the Latin for a [...] "spoon" [...] or [...] "spatula".

500|$|The typical {{image of}} {{migration}} is of northern landbirds, such as swallows (Hirundinidae) and birds of prey, making long flights to the tropics. However, many Holarctic wildfowl and finch (Fringillidae) species {{winter in the}} North Temperate Zone, in regions with milder winters than their summer breeding grounds. For example, the pink-footed goose migrates from Iceland to Britain and neighbouring countries, whilst the dark-eyed junco migrates from subarctic and arctic climates to the contiguous United States and the American goldfinch [...] from taiga to wintering grounds extending from the American South northwestward to Western Oregon. Migratory routes and wintering grounds are traditional and learned by young during their first migration with their parents. [...] Some ducks, such as the <b>garganey</b> <b>Anas</b> <b>querquedula,</b> move completely or partially into the tropics. The European pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca also follows this migratory trend, breeding in Asia and Europe and wintering in Africa.|$|R

40|$|The {{semi-arid}} {{districts of}} Tirunelveli and Tuticorin {{in the southern}} Indian state of Tamil Nadu consist of numerous wetlands {{in the form of}} irrigation tanks, interconnected by an ancient network of canals, and fed by the rivers originating from the Western Ghats. While these irrigation tanks have socio-economic and cultural significance, very little is known of their ecological importance. These tanks have the potential to harbor good populations of resident and wintering waterbirds but no studies have been done to confirm this. A survey was carried out in 230 irrigation tanks of various sizes in the two districts from November 2008 to January 2011. A total of 83 waterbird species were recorded. Indian Pond Heron Ardeola grayii occurred in most of the surveyed tanks. Large concentrations of wintering waterfowl such as Eurasian Wigeon Anas penelope, Northern Pintail <b>Anas</b> acuta, <b>Garganey</b> <b>Anas</b> <b>querquedula</b> were recorded in tanks closer to the coast.

40|$|Most {{species of}} long-distance migratory birds put on energy stores to fuel their travels. However, {{recent studies have}} {{highlighted}} the potential costs associated with carrying too much fuel, either through increased predation risk or decreased flight efficiency. Consequently, it is now widely accepted that migratory birds should carry optimal rather than maximum fuel loads. Information from 372 <b>garganey</b> (<b>Anas</b> <b>querquedula)</b> ringed and recaptured at least once during the same spring in the Camargue, southern France, was used to document fuelling rates of individual ducks in relation to environmental variation and individual variation in condition. On average, garganey added very little fuel stores in the Camargue (mean gain per day = 0. 33 g, less than 0. 5 % of mean body-mass in total over an average stay of 5 days). Fuelling rates were negatively correlated with body mass at capture, but it cannot be excluded that this pattern was a statistical artefact. Given their body-mass at ringing, garganey could potentially still fly long distances when they stop in the Camargue. It is therefore likely that the aim of their stay in southern France is more for resting than refuelling, a finding that may have implications for the proper management of stop-over sites. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim is to}} {{evaluate}} ecological diversity of wild birds in Siberia and the Russian Far East, which are carriers of Newcastle disease virus that belongs to potentially dangerous pathogen for poultry. Methods.   Biological materials (cloacal swabs and intestinal fragments) of wild migratory birds were collected in 2008 - 2014. The viral isolates were propagated in the allantoic cavity of developing chicken embryos. The presence of virus was determined in hemagglutination tests and primary identification of Newcastle disease virus was confirmed by RT-PCR. Pathogenicity of the obtained isolates was determined in tests ICPI and MDT. Results.   4443 samples were obtained from wild migratory birds of 11 avian orders and were investigated. Newcastle disease virus was detected in 40 birds from 4 orders. The Duck family (Anatidae) of the Waterfowl order (Anseriformes)  plays the {{leading role in the}} circulation of Newcastle disease virus in Siberia and the Far East.

40|$|The aim is {{to explore}} the {{ecological}} diversity of wild birds in Siberia, which are carriers of the Avian Influenza Virus (AIV). Methods. Biological material {{in the form of}} cloacal swabs and intestinal fragments from wild migratory birds were collected in the period 2007 - 2014 years. The virus has been gained in the allantoic cavity of developing chicken embryos. The presence of virus was determined in hemagglutination and primary identification and subtyping of influenza virus was confirmed by RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). Results. It was collected and investigated 2300 samples obtained from wild migratory birds 8 Orders. The influenza virus was detected in 185 birds of the three groups. The main role in the circulation of the AIV in the south of Western Siberia, playing members of the family Anatidae Order Anseriformes, namely species - Teal (<b>Anas</b> crecca), <b>garganey</b> (<b>Anas</b> <b>querquedula),</b> and shoveler (<b>Anas</b> clypeata). In the period from 2007 to 2014, the percentage of virus infection in waterfowl ranged from 5. 6 to 20 %.

40|$|The HUNGARIAN WATERFOWL MONITORING (HWM) {{takes place}} at 48 {{observation}} units. The current study shows the 25 common waterfowl species, their trend, phenology, and dispersion in Hungary using the data of a ten-year period between the 1996 / 1997 and 2005 / 2006 seasons. The six commonest species were: Anas platyrhynchos, Anser albifrons, Anser fabalis, Anser anser, Anas crecca and Fulica atra. During the ten-year period there were 8 species with about 1000 individuals or less (Anser erythropus, Mergus albellus, Tachybaptus ruficollis, Phalacrocorax pygmeus, Netta rufina, Podiceps nigricollis, Cygnus olor, Mergus merganser). We report a heavy increase of Aythya nyroca, Phalacrocorax pygmeus, Netta rufina, Podiceps nigricollis, Anas clypeata, Cygnus olor, Anser albifrons, Podiceps cristatus, Anser anser, Anas strepera and a slight increase of Phalacrocorax pygmeus and Tachybaptus ruficollis.

The 25 species were put into six different groups based on their types of phenology: late summer migrating species, species migrating dominantly in autumn, over wintering species, species passing through Hungary dominantly in spring, spring and late summer migrants, species with a stable population. Eco-geographical differences between Transdanubia and the Great Hungarian Plain explain the differences in the dispersion of species: distribution dominance in Transdanubia, dispersion dominance in the Great Hungarian Plain, even distribution. Our conclusions confirmed some of the earlier results, but in some cases we made conclusions different from the earlier suggestions.

40|$|The {{most serious}} threat to {{traditional}} rural ponds in Haryana is associated with transformed societal behavioural patterns, ethics, values and life style, amongst several others. The siltation of ponds with adjoining areas, soil coming in with rain water {{is a very serious}} cause of stratification of rural ponds. Also contracting of village community land for sun drying of cow dung cakes inspires villagers to overload periphery of each pond with cow dung turning the premises into grave-yard of dung. This dung is the major source of polluting pond water into blackish water with high load of organic matter. Moreover, it leads to over excessive eutrophication. Building of major highways and connectivity roads have resulted into compartmentalization and degradation of village ponds. Inhabitation of peripheral village ponds boundaries by lower section of society for dwelling purposes is more threat to wetlands. The indifferent inclination of villagers towards silted ponds drenched in bad odour and blackish sludge is the story of 80 % of the cases. The total blockage of run-off rainy water towards the natural age old rural ponds due to obstruction by way of human inhabitation has resulted into desertification of shallow water sheet in 90 % of the cases. The oblivion of harvesting dried silt in summer for brick making has spelled doom for the ponds turning them into flat ground through successive decades and so on. The water quality in all ponds was overshooting the decaying stage due to the continuous mixing of cow dung drenched rainy water. Over excessive usage of ponds for bathing of cattle, dumping of cow dung and rotten vegetables waste has turned ponds into live sinks of dirt, garbage and rural dairy wastes. Majority of village ponds are now out of existence or in deep black sludge laden or converted into Fish-Farming wetlands.
