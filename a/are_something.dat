5|$|Tales of love often involve incest, or the {{seduction}} or rape of a mortal woman {{by a male}} god, resulting in heroic offspring. The stories generally suggest that relationships between gods and mortals <b>are</b> <b>something</b> to avoid; even consenting relationships rarely have happy endings. In a few cases, a female divinity mates with a mortal man, as in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, where the goddess lies with Anchises to produce Aeneas.|$|E

25|$|Viennese cafés have an {{extremely}} long and distinguished history {{that dates back}} centuries, and the caffeine addictions of some famous historical patrons of the oldest <b>are</b> <b>something</b> of a local legend. These coffee houses are unique to Vienna and many cities have unsuccessfully sought to copy them. Some people consider cafés as their extended living room where nobody will be bothered if they spend hours reading a newspaper while enjoying their coffee. Traditionally, the coffee comes {{with a glass of}} water. Viennese cafés claim to have invented the process of filtering coffee from booty captured after the second Turkish siege in 1683. Viennese cafés claim that when the invading Turks left Vienna, they abandoned hundreds of sacks of coffee beans. The Polish King John III Sobieski, the commander of the anti-Turkish coalition of Poles, Germans, and Austrians, gave Franz George Kolschitzky (Polish – Franciszek Jerzy Kulczycki) some of this coffee as a reward for providing information that allowed him to defeat the Turks. Kolschitzky then opened Vienna's first coffee shop. Julius Meinl set up a modern roasting plant in the same premises where the coffee sacks were found, in 1891.|$|E

While Variety deemed it [...] "clichéd" [...] and [...] "morbid", The New York Times commented that [...] "the falls and Miss Monroe <b>are</b> <b>something</b> to see", as although Monroe may not be [...] "the perfect actress at this point ... she can be seductive– even when she walks".|$|E
500|$|An {{important}} subset to this deterministic theme, {{related to}} the original worldview idea as well, {{is the lack of}} personal responsibility that those in the underclass accept for their own actions. An example of this, which is repeated numerous times throughout the collection, is the statement, [...] "The knife went in", in reference to the words of one of Dalrymple's patients who was in jail for murder. This sort of speech makes a person's actions seem like they <b>are</b> <b>something</b> separate from the person themselves and that they have no control over it.|$|E

500|$|Type physicalism (or type-identity theory) was {{developed}} by John Smart and Ullin Place as a direct reaction {{to the failure of}} behaviorism. These philosophers reasoned that, if mental states <b>are</b> <b>something</b> material, but not behavioral, then mental states are probably identical to internal states of the brain. In very simplified terms: a mental state M is nothing other than brain state B. The mental state [...] "desire for a cup of coffee" [...] would thus be nothing more than the [...] "firing of certain neurons in certain brain regions".|$|E
500|$|The trailer {{generated}} controversy {{around the}} depiction of the daughter's death. Fahey said that such elements <b>are</b> <b>something</b> video games usually [...] "shy away from", yet it {{is presented as a}} main focus in the trailer. Ben Parfitt from Market for Home Computing and Video Games found it offensive and thought that the team had stepped across the mark. Defending the trailer, Axis said that their depiction fit the overarching narrative. Robert Rath from The Escapist also liked the segment, calling it [...] "deliberate and necessary", and thought that the overall effect would have been significantly hampered if had been removed from the trailer.|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} {{applications}} of filters whose design objectives <b>are</b> <b>something</b> other than rejection or passing of certain frequencies. [...] Frequently, a simple device that {{is intended to}} work over only a narrow band or just one spot frequency will not look much like a filter design. [...] However, a broadband design for the same item requires many more elements and the design takes {{on the nature of}} a filter. [...] Amongst the more common applications of this kind in waveguide are impedance matching networks, directional couplers, power dividers, power combiners, and diplexers. [...] Other possible applications include multiplexers, demultiplexers, negative-resistance amplifiers, and time-delay networks.|$|E
