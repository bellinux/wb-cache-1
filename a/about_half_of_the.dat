5|$|Further hazards {{exist in}} the form of snowpack on <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volcanoes; under the {{influence}} of pyroclastic flows, the snowpack can melt, generating dangerous lahars such as the one generated by the 1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz volcano in Colombia. This eruption claimed 23,000 fatalities, and lahars are a major cause of volcanic eruption associated fatalities.|$|E

5|$|A {{particularly}} {{large and}} rich region for detecting interstellar molecules is Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2). This giant molecular cloud lies {{near the center}} of the Milky Way galaxy and is a frequent target for new searches. <b>About</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molecules listed below were first found near Sgr B2, and nearly every other molecule has since been detected in this feature.

5|$|After {{the chicks}} hatch, the birds will desert their nest. Even though the young can swim and dive during this time, they rarely do, instead {{staying on the}} parents' backs for four days after hatching. After about 10 days, the parents split the chicks up, with each parent taking care of <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brood. After this split, the chicks are {{independent}} in about 10 days, and fledge in about three weeks.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of the {{spectrum}} can also reveal the surface gravity of the star. This is usually expressed as log g, the base-10 logarithm of the gravitational acceleration given in CGS units, in this case, cm/s². Beta Pictoris has logg=4.15, implying a surface gravity of 140 m/s², which is <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gravitational acceleration at {{the surface of the}} Sun (274m/s²).|$|E
5|$|Carter and Frank Spotnitz wrote major {{parts of}} the script in Hawaii over Christmas 1996. They used the same method that they had used when writing episodes and {{sketching}} out scenes for the series on 3x5 index cards. By the time the Christmas break had ended, the whole narrative for the film had been written. Upon his return from Hawaii, Carter looked for spare time to write the script. He returned to Hawaii and in ten days wrote <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 124-page screenplay for the film.|$|E

While some of the production is for forcing, most is for dry bulb production. Bulb production and forcing occurs in the East, while production in the south west is mainly for outdoor flower production. The farm gate value was estimated at £10m in 2007.|$|E

5|$|St. John's, and the {{province}} as a whole, was gravely affected in the 1990s {{by the collapse}} of the northern cod fishery, which had been the driving force of the provincial economy for hundreds of years. After a decade of high unemployment rates and depopulation, the city's proximity to the Hibernia, Terra Nova and White Rose oil fields led to an economic boom that spurred population growth and commercial development. As a result, the St. John's area now accounts for <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> province's economic output.|$|E
5|$|That's why I say {{the players}} didn't stab the ACB in the back.

It wasn't really surprising then that more than 50 players from around the world signed lucrative WSC contracts and a revolution was born. <b>About</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WSC players were from Australia and this high ratio can, in part, be attributed to Bradman's tight-fisted approach to the ACB's money.|$|E
