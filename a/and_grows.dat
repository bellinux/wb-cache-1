5|$|Boletus subluridellus is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, <b>and</b> <b>grows</b> {{in association}} with deciduous trees, especially oak (genus Quercus).

40|$|In {{this project}} two {{inventories}} {{by means of}} extensive literature searches have been executed: Inventory 1 {{of all types of}} soil <b>and</b> <b>growing</b> media (if relevant components thereof) to be elaborated considering (i) the soil <b>and</b> <b>growing</b> medium imported as commodities (i. e. not in association with plants intended for planting), (ii) the soil <b>and</b> <b>growing</b> medium attached to plants for planting, and (iii) the soil <b>and</b> <b>growing</b> medium attached as a contaminant to imported goods (ranging from ware potatoes to agricultural machinery). Inventory 2, based on interceptions data and scientific and technical literature, of plant pests, plant diseases and weeds that can be associated with soil <b>and</b> <b>growing</b> medium (if relevant components thereof). Execution of Inventory 1 resulted in a list of 956 soils <b>and</b> <b>growing</b> media. Execution of Inventory 2 resulted in Excel tables for each taxonomic group separately in which the pests and diseases are linked to the soil <b>and</b> <b>growing</b> media. Additional information has been provided for processes applied to produce <b>growing</b> media <b>and</b> the impact on harmful organisms and private certification schemes applied in Europe to control the trade <b>and</b> use of <b>growing</b> media...|$|R

5|$|Normally shy or {{indifferent}} {{to the presence of}} divers, the Caribbean reef shark has been known to become aggressive in the presence of food <b>and</b> <b>grows</b> sufficiently large to be considered potentially dangerous.

5|$|Tremella mesenterica {{may also}} be {{confused}} {{with members of the}} Dacrymycetaceae family, like Dacrymyces chrysospermus (formerly D.palmatus), due to their superficial resemblance. Microscopic examination shows that the Dacrymycetaceae have Y-shaped basidia with two spores, unlike the longitudinally split basidia characteristic of Tremella; additionally, D.chrysospermus is smaller, has a whitish attachment point to its substrate, <b>and</b> <b>grows</b> on conifer wood.|$|E

5|$|B.sessilis var. cordata was {{published}} as Dryandra floribunda var. cordata by Carl Meissner in 1848. In 1870, George Bentham published D.floribunda var. major, {{but this is}} now considered a taxonomic synonym of B.sessilis var. cordata. It has larger inflorescences than var. sessilis, as well as larger dark green rather than blue green leaves. It {{is found in the}} state's far southwest, between Capes Leeuwin and Naturaliste, and east to Walpole, <b>and</b> <b>grows</b> on sandy soils over limestone.|$|E
5|$|Coccomyces dentatus is a {{saprobic}} species, <b>and</b> <b>grows</b> on {{dead leaves}} {{of a wide}} variety of angiosperms. It is frequently encountered on members of the heather (family Ericaceae), and the beech family (Fagaceae), such as oak (red, white, and live oak) and chestnut, and also on the exotic Castanea sativa from Chile. Other common substrates include leaves of trees in the genera Rhododendron, Lithocarpus, Berberis, Arbutus, Gaultheria, and Myrica.|$|E
5|$|Cyptotrama asprata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, <b>and</b> <b>grows</b> on the decaying wood of deciduous and coniferous trees.

In temperate North America, specimens are typically collected between July through September.|$|E

5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium {{differs from}} other species within the genus Eriophorum in its habitat and morphology. Its {{multiple}} flower heads and growth from rhizomes {{distinguish it from}} E.vaginatum, which has a single flower head <b>and</b> <b>grows</b> from dense tussocks. Although E.latifolium has 2–12 flower heads, it has laxly caespitose (tufted) growth, and its pappi are forked. The smooth peduncles and preference for acidic soil pH distinguishes E.angustifolium from E.gracile, which grows in swamp with a neutral pH and has scabrid (rough) peduncles.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe maculata, {{commonly}} known as the frosty fibrecap, is a species of mushroom in the Inocybaceae family. First described by Jean Louis Émile Boudier in 1885, I. maculata can be found throughout Europe, Asia and North America. It is a medium-sized brown mushroom with a fibrous, brown cap with white remnants of a universal veil in the middle. The stem is cream or brown. The species is ectomycorrhizal <b>and</b> <b>grows</b> at the base of various trees, including beech. Inocybe maculata is poisonous, containing muscarine. Possible symptoms after consumption of I.maculata mushrooms are salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and vomiting, with the possibility of death due to respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|Lambertia formosa {{is readily}} grown in {{cultivation}} given a sunny position and fair drainage, though it tolerates {{a range of}} soils and some shade. Its flowers attract birds, especially important as this can provide a source of food year-round. The plant responds well to pruning. Seeds germinate within 25 to 60 days of sowing, and firm young growth makes the best cutting material for propagation. Fertilisers generally are not needed, but slow release low-phosphorus fertilisers are tolerated. The species is frost-hardy <b>and</b> <b>grows</b> in temperate to subtropical climates.|$|E

5|$|Lysurus mokusin is saprobic, <b>and</b> <b>grows</b> solitarily or {{in small}} groups in forest litter, and wood chip mulch used in landscaping, and compost. Documented {{sightings}} of L.mokusin include Australasia, the Canary Islands, Korea, Japan, China (Fujian Province), and the Bonin Islands. The species was unknown in Europe until it was reported in Italy in 1979; it is considered an alien species in that continent. In the United States, it has been collected from the states of California, Texas, and Washington, D.C..|$|E

Three are available to select {{from the beginning of the}} game and others can be obtained by completing Silver Reward Scrolls. The currently-owned creature can be swapped with a new one at certain points in the game. The creature starts out small, <b>and</b> <b>grows</b> as the game progresses. Each has strengths and weaknesses: apes are intelligent and proficient at learning but lack strength; tigers are strong but learn slowly.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia lanceolata {{is rarely}} seen in cultivation, mainly due to {{difficulties}} in propagation; seed germination is unpredictable, and cuttings have proven difficult to strike. Nevertheless, its bright green hue {{is considered an}} attractive horticultural feature. Well drained sandy soils in sun or part shade are needed for this plant in a garden setting. Once established, it tolerates moderate frosts and dry spells, <b>and</b> <b>grows</b> fairly readily in suitable conditions. Plantsmen in England were able to germinate seed there in 1791.|$|E

5|$|Persoonia levis {{is rarely}} seen in cultivation, {{mainly because of}} {{difficulties}} in propagation; seed germination is unpredictable, and cuttings have been nearly impossible to strike. Nevertheless, its colourful bark and leaves are attractive horticultural features. Well-drained sandy soils in sun or part shade are needed for the plant in a garden situation. Once established, it tolerates moderate frosts and dry spells <b>and</b> <b>grows</b> fairly readily, albeit slowly, in suitable conditions. Plantsmen in England germinated seed as early as 1795.|$|E
