The chemical structures {{of all the}} tags are identical but each contains isotopes substituted at various positions, such that the mass reporter and mass normalization regions have different molecular masses in each tag. The combined M-F-N-R regions of the tags have the same total molecular weights and structure so that during chromatographic or electrophoretic separation and in single MS mode, molecules labelled with different tags are indistinguishable. Upon fragmentation in MS/MS mode, sequence information is obtained from fragmentation of the peptide back bone and quantification data are simultaneously obtained from fragmentation of the tags, giving rise to mass reporter ions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{availability}} of {{better and more}} stable linkers has changed {{the function of the}} chemical bond. The type of linker, cleavable or noncleavable, lends specific properties to the cytotoxic (anti-cancer) drug. For example, a non-cleavable linker keeps the drug within the cell. As a result, the entire antibody, linker and cytotoxic (anti-cancer) agent enter the targeted cancer cell where the antibody is degraded to the level of an amino acid. The resulting complex - amino acid, linker and cytotoxic agent - now becomes the active drug. In contrast, cleavable linkers are catalyzed by enzymes in the cancer cell where it releases the cytotoxic agent. The difference is that the cytotoxic payload delivered via <b>a</b> <b>cleavable</b> <b>linker</b> can escape from the targeted cell and, in a process called [...] "bystander killing", attack neighboring cancer cells.|$|E

40|$|The {{large size}} of {{biological}} molecules such as proteins and oligonucleotides makes them inherently problematic to analyse and quantify directly by mass spectrometry. For these molecules, electrospray ionisation produces multiply charged species and associated alkali metal adducts which can reduce sensitivity and complicate quantification. Whereas time-of-flight mass analysers, often coupled to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation, can have insufficient mass resolution {{to resolve these}} large molecules in the higher m/z range. This {{has led to the}} development of cleavable small molecule mass tag approaches for the indirect analysis of biomolecules such as proteins and oligonucleotides. Existing methodologies require the design and synthesis of <b>a</b> <b>cleavable</b> <b>linker</b> to join the biomolecule and the mass tag.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a method for the rapid and unambiguous identification of sequences of hit compounds from one-bead-one-compound combinatorial libraries of peptide and peptoid ligands.

This aldehyde can then be derivatized with a bromine-containing amino-oxy compound that serves as an isotope tag for subsequent MS/MS analysis of y-ion fragments.

This allowed us to retrieve and identify 34 DUBs and their interacting partners. We also noted the expression, in host cells infected with Chlamydia trachomatis, of two additional DUBs. Furthermore, we retrieved and identified chlamydial DUB 1 (ChlaDUB 1) and DUB 2 (ChlaDUB 2), demonstrating by experiment that ChlaDUB 2, the presence and activity of which had not been detected in infected cells, is in fact expressed during the course of infection. ...|$|E

Two strategies directed towards the synthesis of a building block suitable for solid-phase peptide synthesis were developed: a chemoenzymatic route, involving l-threonine aldolase, and an enantioselective chemical route; these led to α,γ-diamino-β-hydroxybutanoic acids in diastereoisomerically mixed and enantiopure forms, respectively. Incorporation of the 1, 2 -amino alcohol linker into the backbone of a peptide generated a conditional peptide that was rapidly cleaved at very low concentrations of sodium periodate. This cleavable peptide ligand was applied in the generation of MHC exchange reagents for the detection of antigen-specific T cells in peripheral blood cells. The extremely low concentration of periodate required to trigger MHC peptide exchange allowed the co-oxidation of methionine and disulfide residues to be avoided. Conditional MHC reagents hypersensitive to periodate can now be applied without limitations when UV irradiation is undesired or less practical...|$|E

In the present paper, we constructed cytotoxic conjugates that specifically target angiogenic endothelial cells, thus preventing typical side effects of apoptosis-inducing drugs. For this purpose, we conjugated the potent antimitotic agent monomethyl-auristatin-E (MMAE) via <b>a</b> lysosomal <b>cleavable</b> <b>linker</b> to human serum albumin (HSA) and further equipped this drug-albumin conjugate with cyclic c(RGDfK) peptides for multivalent interaction with alpha(v) beta(3) -integrin.

The resulting drug-targeting conjugates RGDPEG-MMAE-HSA and RGD-MMAE-HSA demonstrated high binding affinity and specificity for alpha(v) beta(3) -integrin expressing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Both types of conjugates were internalized by endothelial cells and killed the target cells at low nM concentrations. Furthermore, we observed RGD-dependent binding of the conjugates to C 26 carcinoma. Upon i. v. administration to C 26 -tumor bearing mice, both drug-targeting conjugates displayed excellent tumor homing properties.

Silanization of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) nanoparticles with 3 -(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate introduced polymerizable groups on the surface. Polymerization with allylamine, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, and trimethylolpropane ethoxylate (14 / 3 EO/OH) triacrylate provided a polymeric coating and amino groups to serve as starting points for the synthesis.

Successful synthesis of Leu-enkephalin was demonstrated on the "high-load" MNPs. Chemical stability studies proved the particles to be stable under SPPS conditions and magnetization measurements showed that the magnetic properties of the particles were maintained throughout derivatizations and SPPS.

The chimeric antibody BR 96 -doxorubicin conjugate (BR 96 -DOX) was developed with the hydrazone conjugation strategy. BR 96 -DOX was advanced to a Phase II human clinical trial in metastatic breast cancer (Tolcher et al., 1999). The toxicity profile of the conjugate was considerably improved compared to free doxorubicin administration. However, gastrointestinal toxicity was still prominent and clinical outcomes were not satisfying due to its low tolerability. Another example is the anti-CD 33 antibody calicheamicin conjugate, Mylotarg® (Linenberger et al., 2001; Sievers et al., 2001). Mylotarg® showed encouraging clinical results and was approved in 2000. However, as mentioned earlier, it was withdrawn from the market in 2010 {{due to a lack}} of clinically significant improvement of patient outcome. Both unsuccessful ADCs suffered from toxicities and low tolerability, which seems to be attributed to lability of the hydrazone linker during circulation. Indeed, ADCs with the hydrazone linker undergo slow hydrolysis under physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37 °C), resulting in a slow release of the toxic payload (Laguzza et al., 1989).|$|E

Conjugation of an antimicrobial peptide to a cephalosporin, through <b>a</b> <b>cleavable</b> <b>linker,</b> reversibly masks one of the activity determinants of the peptide. Its release from the β-lactam core can be selectively triggered by bacterial enzymes (β-lactamases) which mediate resistance to β-lactam agents. A prototypical cephalothin-bactenecin candidate was synthesised, using a copper(I) -catalysed azide–alkyne cyclo-addition reaction for the conjugationstep. Enzymatic hydrolysis assays of this candidate were initially performed with a purified β-lactamase to confirm that the peptide can be released from the cephalosporin. The antimicrobial activity of the conjugate was then assessed against representative strains of bacteria and compared to the activities of its parent β-lactam and peptide components and to those of two analogous conjugates based on non-cleavable linkers. The results of these assays indicate that the conjugate has an activity distinct from its separate constituents and that the release of the peptide from the cephalosporin may contribute to its mechanism of action. Furthermore, the results of antimicrobial assays performed with an isogenic strain of bacteria expressing or not an extended-spectrum β-lactamase, suggest that antimicrobial peptide prodrug candidates targeting resistant bacteria could be generated from these hybrid antibiotics...|$|E

We describe a novel fused toxin, composed of disintegrin, uPA (urokinase-type plasminogen activator) -cleavable linker, and melittin. Disintegrin is a single strand peptide (73 aa) isolated from Gloydius Ussuriensis venom. The RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) site of disintegrin dominates its interaction with integrins {{on the surface of}} the tumor cells. uPA is over-expressed and plays an important role in tumor cell invasiveness and metastatic progression. The DLM (disintegrin-linker-melittin) linker is uPA-cleavable, enabling DLM to release melittin. We compared binding activity of our synthesized disintegrin with native disintegrin and report that DLM had less binding activity than the native form. uPA-cleavage was evaluated in vitro and the uPA-cleavable linker released melittin. Treating tumors expressing uPA with DLM enhanced tumor cell killing as well as reduced toxicity to erythrocytes and other non-cancerous normal cells.

However, multiplexing potential is limited due to the broad, and thus often overlapping, signals emitted. An alternative to labelling detection probes with fluorescent tags is to use cleavable small molecule mass tags with detection by mass spectrometry. Herein, a self-reporting detection probe was designed for use in a hybridisation assay for indirect oligonucleotide detection via cleavable small molecule mass tags. The self-reporting detection probe contains an analyte complementary region and a reporter region. The reporter region is a custom designed DNA/RNA chimeric nucleotide sequence. The ribose-phosphate backbone is used as a built-in enzyme cleavable linker, generating small nucleotide products upon cleavage by RNase A. These nucleotides can then serve as mass tags for indirect detection of oligonucleotides. This system avoids the need to design or synthesise <b>a</b> <b>cleavable</b> <b>linker</b> by exploiting the properties of the RNA molecule. This approach was used for the successful detection of a synthetic microRNA and the multiplexing potential was demonstrated by the simultaneous detection of two RNAs...|$|E
40|$|The {{completeness}} of tumor removal {{during surgery}} {{is dependent on}} the surgeon’s ability to differentiate tumor from normal tissue using subjective criteria that are not easily quantifiable. A way to objectively assess tumor margins during surgery in patients would be of great value. We have developed a method to visualize tumors during surgery using activatable cell-penetrating peptides (ACPPs), in which the fluorescently labeled, polycationic cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) is coupled via <b>a</b> <b>cleavable</b> <b>linker</b> to a neutralizing peptide. Upon exposure to proteases characteristic of tumor tissue, the linker is cleaved, dissociating the inhibitory peptide and allowing the CPP to bind to and enter tumor cells. In mice, xenografts stably transfected with green fluorescent protein show colocalization with the Cy 5 -labeled ACPPs. In the same mouse models, Cy 5 -labeled free ACPPs and ACPPs conjugated to dendrimers (ACPPDs) delineate the margin between tumor and adjacent tissue, resulting in improved precision of tumor resection. Surgery guided by ACPPD resulted in fewer residual cancer cells left in the animal after surgery as measured by Alu PCR. A single injection of ACPPD dually labeled with Cy 5 and gadolinium chelates enabled preoperative whole-body tumor detection by MRI, intraoperative guidance by real-time fluorescence, intraoperative histological analysis of margin status by fluorescence, and postoperative MRI tumor quantification. Animals whose tumors were resected with ACPPD guidance had better long-term tumor-free survival and overall survival than animals whose tumors were resected with traditional bright-field illumination only...|$|E
30|$|Recently, Garbaccio and {{co-workers}} developed <b>a</b> novel <b>cleavable</b> <b>linker</b> with <b>a</b> pyrophosphate diester structure (Fig.  7 D) (Kern et al., 2016). This anionic linker has greater aqueous solubility than traditional linkers and excellent circulatory stability. Furthermore, upon internalization, the pyrophosphate diester gets promptly cleaved through the endosomal-lysosomal pathway to liberate unmodified payload molecules. The authors {{speculate that the}} pyrophosphate diester goes through a two-step enzymatic linker cleavage that releases a payload-monophosphate molecule and then a free payload, although the enzyme(s) involved in this process {{have not yet been}} identified. With this encouraging result, they set out to construct conjugates of the anti-human CD 70 antibody and various glucocorticoids using this linker. The ADCs constructed showed great stability in human plasma (intact in vitro up to 7 days) and fast linker cleavage and release of free payload molecules in lysosomes. Interestingly, each conjugate released a free payload at different rates, depending on the substituent group proximal to the pyrophosphate moiety. This result suggests that the rate of release could be fine-tuned by further structural modifications. In addition, one of the ADCs containing fluticasone propionate exerted remarkable potency (EC 50 : 0.37 nmol/L) in CD 70 -positive 786 -O cells, comparable to free fluticasone propionate (EC 50 : 0.25 nmol/L). These results demonstrate the potential of the pyrophosphate diester linker for the future development of therapeutically practical ADCs.|$|R
5000|$|A stable {{link between}} the {{antibody}} and cytotoxic (anti-cancer) agent is a crucial aspect of an ADC. [...] A highly stable ADC linker will ensure that less of the cytotoxic payload falls off in circulation, driving an improved safety profile, and will also ensure that more of the payload arrives at the cancer cell, driving enhanced efficacy. Linkers are based on chemical motifs including disulfides, hydrazones or peptides (cleavable), or thioethers (noncleavable) and control the distribution and delivery of the cytotoxic agent to the target cell. Cleavable and noncleavable types of linkers have been proven to be safe in preclinical and clinical trials. Brentuximab vedotin includes <b>an</b> enzyme-sensitive <b>cleavable</b> <b>linker</b> that delivers the potent and highly toxic antimicrotubule agent monomethyl auristatin E or MMAE, a synthetic antineoplastic agent, to human specific CD30-positive malignant cells. Because of its high toxicity MMAE, which inhibits cell division by blocking the polymerization of tubulin, cannot {{be used as a}} single-agent chemotherapeutic drug. However, the combination of MMAE linked to an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody (cAC10, a cell membrane protein of the tumor necrosis factor or TNF receptor) proved to be stable in extracellular fluid, cleavable by cathepsin and safe for therapy. Trastuzumab emtansine, the other approved ADC, is a combination of the microtubule-formation inhibitor mertansine (DM-1), a derivative of the Maytansine, and antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin/ Genentech/Roche) attached by a stable, non-cleavable linker.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{examined}} {{the concept of}} a novel prodrug strategy in which anticancer drug can be locally released by visible/near IR light, taking advantage of the photodynamic process and photo-unclick chemistry. Our most recently formulated prodrug of combretastatin A- 4, Pc-(L-CA 4) 2, showed multifunctionality for fluorescence imaging, light-activated drug release, and the combined effects of PDT and local chemotherapy. In this formulation, L is <b>a</b> singlet oxygen <b>cleavable</b> <b>linker.</b> Here, we advanced this multifunctional prodrug by adding a tumor-targeting group, folic acid (FA). We designed and prepared four FA-conjugated prodrugs 1 − 4 (CA 4 -L-Pc-PEGn-FA: n = 0, 2, 18, ∼ 45) and one non-FA-conjugated prodrug 5 (CA 4 -L-Pc-PEG 18 -boc). Prodrugs 3 and 4 had a longer PEG spacer and showed higher hydrophilicity, enhanced uptake to colon 26 cells via FR-mediated mechanisms, and more specific localization to SC colon 26 tumors in Balb/c mice than prodrugs 1 and 2. Prodrug 4 also showed higher and more specific uptake to tumors, resulting in selective tumo...|$|R
