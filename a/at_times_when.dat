When a Maya city was invaded by a rival, it was pillaged by the victors. One {{of the most striking}} archaeological markers of such an invasion is the destruction of the defeated city's stelae, which were broken and cast down. At the end of the Preclassic, around 150 AD, this fate appears to have befallen the important city of El Mirador, where most of the stelae were found smashed.|$|E

5|$|In the end, four {{broadband}} filters were chosen, centred at wavelengths of 300 nm (near-ultraviolet), 450nm (blue light), 606nm (red light) and 814nm (near-infrared). Because the quantum efficiency of Hubble's detectors is quite low at 300nm, the noise in observations at this wavelength is {{primarily due to}} CCD noise rather than sky background; thus, these observations could be conducted <b>at</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> high background noise would have harmed the efficiency of observations in other passbands.|$|E
5|$|Medical issues forced Schweitzer {{to leave}} Africa many times, and {{sometimes}} Albert {{kept her from}} returning <b>at</b> <b>times.</b> <b>When</b> Albert {{decided to return to}} Africa in 1924, he took on Oxford undergraduate, Noel Gillespie, as assistant, leaving Schweitzer behind. After the birth of their daughter (Rhena Schweitzer Miller), Schweitzer was no longer able to live in Lambaréné owing to her health. In 1923 the family moved to Königsfeld im Schwarzwald, Baden-Württemberg, where Albert was building a house for the family. This house is now maintained as a Schweitzer museum.|$|E
5|$|Grey-headed {{flying foxes}} {{are exposed to}} several threats, {{including}} loss of foraging and roosting habitat, competition with the black flying fox, and mass die-offs caused by extreme temperature events. When present in urban environments, grey-headed flying foxes are sometimes perceived as a nuisance. Cultivated orchard fruits are also taken, but apparently only <b>at</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> other food items are scarce. Because their roosting and foraging habits bring the species into conflict with humans, they suffer from direct killing of animals in orchards and harassment and destruction of roosts. Negative public perception of the species has intensified {{with the discovery of}} three recently emerged zoonotic viruses that are potentially fatal to humans: Hendra virus, Australian bat lyssavirus and Menangle virus. However, only Australian bat lyssavirus is known from two isolated cases to be directly transmissible from bats to humans. No person has ever died from ABLV (Lyssavirus) after having had the ABLV post-exposure vaccine.|$|E

5|$|Hartebeest are {{primarily}} grazers, and their diets consist mostly of grasses. A {{study in the}} Nazinga Game Ranch in Burkina Faso found that the hartebeest's skull structure eased the acquisition and chewing of highly fibrous foods. The hartebeest has much lower food intake than {{the other members of}} Alcelaphini. The long thin muzzle of the hartebeest assists in feeding on leaf blades of short grasses and nibbling off leaf sheaths from grass stems. In addition to this, it can derive nutritious food even from tall senile grasses. These adaptations of the hartebeest enable the animal to feed well even in the dry season, which is usually a difficult period for grazers. For instance, in comparison with the roan antelope, the hartebeest is better at procuring and chewing the scarce regrowth of perennial grasses <b>at</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> forage is least available. These unique abilities could have allowed the hartebeest to prevail over other animals millions of years ago, leading to its successful radiation in Africa.|$|E
5|$|Sets of 1d (one penny) to 4d silver coins {{are known}} {{from the time of}} Charles II onwards. However, as there is no record of any {{denomination}} higher than 1d (then struck for circulation in silver) being used in the Maundy gift before 1731, sets from before then are most likely ordinary circulation strikes. At that time, coins used for the Maundy money distribution were indistinguishable from those struck for circulation. It was not until 1752 that coins not struck for circulation were used for the Maundy distribution. <b>At</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> little silver was being struck by the Royal Mint, the coins distributed might bear a previous year's date. To evade statutory prohibitions on the striking of silver coin during the Napoleonic Wars, all Maundy pieces issued from 1800 to 1815 bear the date 1800, though most were struck later. When the date was finally changed in 1816, after the prohibition ended, the size of the coins was slightly reduced, as the Royal Mint increased the amount struck from one troy pound of sterling silver from 62 to 66 shillings of silver coin. The last year in which no Maundy coins were struck was 1821.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of the men}} who {{purchased}} {{sex with}} Falle were police officers, and she knew girls who used drugs with their drug counselors. Falle was brainwashed to believe that her only worth lay in prostitution, which she later said was why it took her so long to exit prostitution. While engaging in prostitution, Falle was frequently threatened by other women in the sex industry, she was verbally abused by her clients, she was stalked, and she was threatened with guns on multiple occasions, including by her pimp. She was also drugged several times, and was once sexually assaulted by an escort driver after having been drugged by him. At one point, she was kidnapped. She had to resort to pulling a knife on people <b>at</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> she was threatened with violence. Because of various instances of violence during her time in prostitution, Falle was injured in a variety of ways. Her pimp broke several of her bones and burned her body.|$|E

5|$|Frogs {{are much}} more vocal, {{especially}} during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates. The presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself. In most species, the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an air sac or sacs in the throat or {{at the corner of}} the mouth. This may distend like a balloon and acts as a resonator, helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere, or the water <b>at</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> the animal is submerged. The main vocalisation is the male's loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage a female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory. This call is modified to a quieter courtship call on the approach of a female or to a more aggressive version if a male intruder draws near. Calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy. Other calls include those given by a female in response to the advertisement call and a release call given by a male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus. When a frog is attacked, a distress or fright call is emitted, often resembling a scream. The usually nocturnal Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) produces a rain call when there is rainfall during daylight hours.|$|E
