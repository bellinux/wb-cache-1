5|$|Dirks' work in {{computational}} chemistry involved creating algorithms and computational {{tools for}} the analysis of nucleic acid thermodynamics and nucleic acid structure prediction. Dirks wrote the initial code for the NUPACK suite of nucleic acid design and <b>analysis</b> <b>tools,</b> which generates base pairing probabilities through calculation of the statistical partition function. Unlike other structure prediction tools, NUPACK is capable of handling an arbitrary number of interacting strands rather than being limited to one or two. Dirks also developed an algorithm capable of efficiently handling certain types of pseudoknots, a class of structure that is more computationally intensive to analyze, although NUPACK only implements this ability for single RNA strands.|$|E
5|$|Many {{recently}} developed SGDs include performance measurement and <b>analysis</b> <b>tools</b> to help monitor the content used by an individual. This raises concerns about privacy, and {{some argue that}} the device user {{should be involved in}} the decision to monitor use in this way. Similar concerns have been raised regarding the proposals for devices with automatic content generation, and privacy is increasingly a factor in design of SGDs. As AAC devices are designed to be used in all areas of a user’s life, there are sensitive legal, social, and technical issues centred on a wide family of personal data management problems that can be found in contexts of AAC use. For example, SGDs may have to be designed so that they support the user's right to delete logs of conversations or content that has been added automatically.|$|E

25|$|Shellcode {{cannot be}} {{executed}} directly. In order to analyze what a shellcode attempts {{to do it}} must be loaded into another process. One common analysis technique is to write a small C program which holds the shellcode as a byte buffer, and then use a function pointer or use inline assembler to transfer execution to it. Another technique is to use an online tool, such as shellcode_2_exe, to embed the shellcode into a pre-made executable husk which can then be analyzed in a standard debugger. Specialized shellcode <b>analysis</b> <b>tools</b> also exist, such as the iDefense sclog project which was originally released in 2005 {{as part of the}} Malcode Analyst Pack. Sclog is designed to load external shellcode files and execute them within an API logging framework.

25|$|High-throughput {{quantification}} of miRNAs is error prone, for {{the larger}} variance (compared to mRNAs) that comes with methodological problems. mRNA-expression is therefore often analyzed to check for miRNA-effects in their levels (e.g. in). Databases {{can be used to}} pair mRNA- and miRNA-data that predict miRNA-targets based on their base sequence. While this is usually done after miRNAs of interest have been detected (e. g. because of high expression levels), ideas for <b>analysis</b> <b>tools</b> that integrate mRNA- and miRNA-expression information have been proposed.|$|E

25|$|The first chess engine (a chess playing {{computer}} program) to beat {{a person}} in tournament play was the Mac Hack Six, in 1967. Soon after, tournaments were created just for chess computers. In 1970, the first North American Computer Chess Championship (NACCC) was held in New York City, and in 1974, the first World Computer Chess Championship (WCCC) was held in Stockholm. Kaissa, a chess program of the Soviet Union was named the world's first computer chess champion. In 1995, the first World Computer Speed Chess Championship was held in Paderborn, Germany for blitz chess. For a time, computers competed in human tournaments as well, but computers have become so strong that humans are {{no longer able to}} compete with them; players now tend to treat them as <b>analysis</b> <b>tools</b> rather than as opponents. Interest remains in computer chess tournaments, especially the World Computer Chess Championship and Top Chess Engine Championship. As of 2016, the World Computer Chess champion is Komodo.|$|E
