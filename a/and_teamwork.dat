5|$|Tactical Realism: a {{variation}} of the standard competitive multiplayer modes, added with the release of the Operation Skull Rain DLC. The game mode features a heavier emphasis on realism <b>and</b> <b>teamwork,</b> removing most of the heads-up display (HUD) elements, the ability to mark opponents, and the ability to see teammates' contours through walls, while also featuring the addition of a realistic ammo management system.|$|E
5|$|There are 150 unique {{players on}} 18 teams, each with {{thematic}} personalities in appearance, play style, and profanity. Teams also vary in skill set, and attributes such as defense, speed, strength, <b>and</b> <b>teamwork.</b> Examples include the Sea Cats (fast all-female team with European accents), the Marines (who wear camouflaged garb and use military jargon), the Demons (high strength attribute with demonic language), and the Black Dragons (ninjas with high agility and combat skills). Teams battle in 32 arenas—one half with traditional, open-style stadiums, {{and the other}} half with environmental obstacles, such as the underground mines. Minor power-ups including health, credits, and skill augments for individual players regenerate regularly on the field.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of training team members in three task- <b>and</b> teamgeneric <b>teamwork</b> skills: planning <b>and</b> task coordination, collaborative problem solving, and communication. We first examined the degree to which task- <b>and</b> team-generic <b>teamwork</b> skills training impacted team performance on a task unrelated to the content of the training program. We then examined whether the effects of task- <b>and</b> team-generic <b>teamwork</b> skills training on team performance were due to the transfer of skills directly related to planning and task coordination, collaborative problem solving, and communication. Results from 65 four-person project teams indicated that task- <b>and</b> team-generic <b>teamwork</b> skills training led to significantly higher levels of team performance. Results also indicated that the effects of task- <b>and</b> teamgeneric <b>teamwork</b> skills training on team performance were mediated by planning and task coordination and collaborative problem solving behavior. Although communication was positively affected by the task- <b>and</b> team-generic <b>teamwork</b> skills training, it did not mediate the relationship between task- <b>and</b> team-generic <b>teamwork</b> skills training <b>and</b> team performance. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed, as well as possible limitations and directions for future research...|$|R

50|$|In baseball, {{a captain}} is an honorary title {{sometimes}} {{given to a}} member of the team to acknowledge his leadership. In the early days of baseball, a captain was a player who was responsible for many of the functions now assumed by managers and coaches, such as preparing lineups, making decisions about strategy, <b>and</b> encouraging <b>teamwork.</b> In amateur or youth baseball, a manager or coach may appoint a team captain to assist in communicating with the players <b>and</b> to encourage <b>teamwork</b> <b>and</b> improvement.|$|R
25|$|A {{more recent}} study {{suggests}} that EI {{is not necessarily a}} universally positive trait. They found a negative correlation between EI and managerial work demands; while under low levels of managerial work demands, they found a negative relationship between EI <b>and</b> <b>teamwork</b> effectiveness. An explanation for this may suggest gender differences in EI, as women tend to score higher levels than men. This furthers the idea that job context plays a role in the relationships between EI, teamwork effectiveness, and job performance. Another interesting find was discussed in a study that assessed a possible link between EI and entrepreneurial behaviors and success.|$|E
25|$|Mars analog {{habitats}} {{are established}} to prepare astronauts, engineers, and researchers {{for the future}} challenges of sending a manned mission to Mars. These analogs are inhabited by small teams of volunteers and may operate under “Mars-like” conditions {{for a few days}} to over a year. Habitats are often located in areas that closely resemble the environment of Mars, such as polar deserts. While living in the habitats, crew members are mostly isolated from the outside world, survive on a diet of freeze-dried food, and may conduct field experiments while wearing protective space suits. Meanwhile, researchers analyze the crew members’ medical and psychological conditions and study the social <b>and</b> <b>teamwork</b> dynamics of the crew.|$|E
25|$|Several design {{elements}} {{are needed to}} enable organizational reward systems to operate successfully. First, for a collective assessment to be appropriate for individual team members, the group's tasks must be highly interdependent. If {{this is not the}} case, individual assessment is more appropriate than team assessment. Second, individual-level reward systems and team-level reward systems must be compatible. For example, it would be unfair to reward the entire team for a job well done if only one team member did most of the work. That team member would most likely view teams <b>and</b> <b>teamwork</b> negatively, and would not want to work on a team in the future. Third, an organizational culture must be created such that it supports and rewards employees who believe in the value of teamwork and who maintain a positive attitude towards team-based rewards.|$|E

25|$|Carl Stotz, a {{resident}} of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, founded Little League Baseball in 1939. He began experimenting with his idea {{in the summer of}} 1938 when he gathered his nephews, Jimmy and Major Gehron and their neighborhood friends. They tried different field dimensions {{over the course of the}} summer and played several informal games. The following summer Stotz felt that he was ready to establish what became Little League Baseball. The first league in Williamsport had just three teams, each sponsored by a different business. The first teams, Jumbo Pretzel, Lycoming Dairy and Lundy Lumber were managed by Carl Stotz and two of his friends George and Bert Bebble. The men joined by their wives and another couple formed the first ever Little League Board of Directors. Stotz's dream of establishing a baseball league for boys to teach fair play <b>and</b> <b>teamwork</b> had come true.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{itself was}} smaller in scale when {{compared}} to the Battle of Ticinus. Although Fabius was not duped by Hannibal’s moves, his blocking force at the pass was. Leonard Cottrell, in his book “Hannibal: Enemy of Rome", wrote that the trick was designed to be recognized by Fabius as a trick. Hannibal had studied the mind of his opponent, and devised a plan to make him do exactly what Hannibal needed him to do. Fabius thought Hannibal was {{trying to get him to}} fight a night action over broken, uneven ground, where Roman infantry would lose their greatest advantages of discipline <b>and</b> <b>teamwork,</b> as their formations would become disorganized. Since Hannibal was choosing the battle ground and the hour, he might have sprung other surprises to gain further advantages on the Romans. Fabius predictably did what Hannibal had anticipated: nothing. The Romans guarding the pass, with no Fabius to keep them in check, thought they were doing their job when they rushed out, preventing a Carthaginian escape. Again, they acted as Hannibal had anticipated, and the Carthaginians took advantage of their actions to escape.|$|E
25|$|Social {{motivation}} {{is tied to}} one's activity in a group. It cannot form from a single mind alone. For example, bowling alone is naught but the dull act of throwing a ball into pins, and so people are {{much less likely to}} smile during the activity alone, even upon getting a strike because their satisfaction or dissatisfaction {{does not need to be}} communicated, and so it is internalized. However, when with a group, people are more inclined to smile regardless of their results because it acts as a positive communication that is beneficial for pleasurable interaction <b>and</b> <b>teamwork.</b> Thus the act of bowling becomes a social activity as opposed to a dull action because it becomes an exercise in interaction, competition, team building, and sportsmanship. It is because of this phenomenon that studies have shown that people are more intrigued in performing mundane activities so long as there is company because it provides the opportunity to interact in one way or another, be it for bonding, amusement, collaboration, or alternative perspectives. Examples of activities that may one may not be motivated to do alone but could be done with others for social benefit are things such as throwing and catching a baseball with a friend, making funny faces with children, building a treehouse, and performing a debate.|$|E
