5|$|An unusual triad {{is found}} in seldolisin proteases. The low pKa of the {{glutamate}} carboxylate group means that it only acts as a base in the triad <b>at</b> <b>very</b> low pH.

5|$|Attempts {{to generalize}} {{ordinary}} quantum field theories, used in elementary particle physics to describe fundamental interactions, {{so as to}} include gravity have led to serious problems. Some have argued that at low energies, this approach proves successful, in that it results in an acceptable effective (quantum) field theory of gravity. <b>At</b> <b>very</b> high energies, however, the perturbative results are badly divergent and lead to models devoid of predictive power ("perturbative non-renormalizability").|$|E
5|$|During the growth, {{the chamber}} {{materials}} are etched {{off by the}} plasma and can incorporate into the growing diamond. In particular, CVD diamond is often contaminated by silicon originating from the silica windows of the growth chamber or from the silicon substrate. Therefore, silica windows are either avoided or {{moved away from the}} substrate. Boron-containing species in the chamber, even <b>at</b> <b>very</b> low trace levels, also make it unsuitable for the growth of pure diamond.|$|E
5|$|In decavanadate, each V(V) {{center is}} {{surrounded}} by six oxide ligands. Vanadic acid, H3VO4 exists only <b>at</b> <b>very</b> low concentrations because protonation of the tetrahedral species − results in the preferential formation of the octahedral + species. In strongly acidic solutions, pH<2. + is the predominant species, while the oxide V2O5 precipitates from solution at high concentrations. The oxide is formally the inorganic anhydride of vanadic acid. The structures of many vanadate compounds have been determined by X-ray crystallography.|$|E

5|$|Multiple organolithium {{reagents}} {{are known}} {{in which there}} is a direct bond between carbon and lithium atoms, effectively creating a carbanion. These are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles. In many of these organolithium compounds, the lithium ions tend to aggregate into high-symmetry clusters by themselves, which is relatively common for alkali cations.

5|$|After passing The Lizard {{the path}} turns northwards, {{continuing}} past Housel Bay and a building used by Guglielmo Marconi for radio experiments, then Bass Point with its Coastguard Station. The Lizard lifeboat station is a sheltered position in Kilcobben Cove. Passing through Cadgwith and across Kennack Sands, the path heads towards Black Head then into Coverack. Once around Lowland Point, The Manacles lie a mile offshore, a reef that has wrecked many ships. The path passes through Porthoustock and Porthallow, then around Nare Point lies Gillan Creek. This can be crossed <b>at</b> <b>very</b> low tide, but most walkers follow the lanes round {{the head of}} the creek to reach Dennis Head {{at the mouth of the}} Helford River.
