5|$|The {{final two}} {{locomotives}} Nos. 6256 and 46257 Sir William A. Stanier, F.R.S and City of Salford were given many new features. In order {{to raise the}} mileage between general overhauls from 70,000 to 100,000, measures were taken to decrease wear to the axle bearings and hornguides {{through the use of}} roller bearings and manganese steel linings. Other modifications included further superheating area, a redesigned rear frame and cast steel trailing truck, rocking grate, hopper <b>ashpan</b> and redesigned cab-sides.|$|E
25|$|Innovative design {{features}} of the AA class included air sanding equipment, improved Gresham No. 9 injectors, horizontal grid spark arrestors, steam for auxiliaries supplied directly from the dome, and a sloped <b>ashpan</b> to provide easier cleaning.|$|E
25|$|The Class GL had {{a rocking}} grate and {{self-cleaning}} hopper <b>ashpan</b> {{with water and}} steam sprayers to dampen down the ash {{to prevent it from}} entering axle boxes, motion areas and other friction-sensitive places. They had self-cleaning type smokeboxes and their axle boxes were grease-lubricated.|$|E
25|$|Broad Gauge Models {{released}} the S Class locomotive in brass {{in the early}} 1980s. 50 of each streamlined engine in blue were released, along with 30 unstreamlined black models. Light globes were used for headlights and, on the streamlined version, the running gear light; this latter feature has not been replicated since. Unfortunately due to an error in design, the models did not feature <b>ashpans.</b>|$|R
50|$|They {{were built}} with Watson Standard no. 1 boilers, while their double hopper type <b>ashpans</b> were {{specially}} designed {{to clear the}} four-wheeled trailing bogies. Their specially designed Type MY tenders were similar in appearance to the Type MX and the North American Vanderbilt type tenders, with cylindrical water tanks. The tenders rode on three-axle Buckeye bogies to reduce the axle load and, along with the Type MX, became commonly known as Torpedo tenders.|$|R
50|$|The LMS had various elderly tank {{engines and}} the {{operating}} department required a new small class 2 locomotive to replace them. Noting that the Great Western Railway 4500 and 4575 Classes of 2-6-2T ('Prairie') had been successful, George Ivatt designed the new engine type incorporating self-emptying <b>ashpans</b> and rocking grates which were labour-saving devices. A tender version, the Ivatt Class 2 2-6-0 was also produced. The LMS classified them as 2P, but BR preferred the classification 2MT.|$|R
25|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were built}} with many LMS standard {{features such as}} a self-cleaning smokebox, rocking firegrate, self-emptying <b>ashpan,</b> side window cab and a simplified footplate together with others which followed NCC practice, such as a water top-feed on a parallel boiler (as opposed to the taper boilers {{being used by the}} LMS at the time), Dreadnought type vacuum brake gear, Detroit sight feed cylinder lubricator and a cast number plate.|$|E
25|$|The boiler used a ‘Forced Draught’ {{provided}} by a mechanical blower (the triangular structure on the right in the illustration). This forced air along a pipe and into the sealed <b>ashpan</b> (below the fire). Very few steam locomotives have ever used a forced draught like this, the main reason is {{that in order to}} add fuel either the draft must be stopped or some form of airlock fitted. Novelty used an airlock to feed the fuel in, but there was still a chance of flame and hot gases being blown into the face of the fireman.|$|E
25|$|Steam was {{collected}} inside a dome {{on top of}} the top chamber, and in the Reed boiler all but the dome and the ends of the three water chambers was enclosed in a double-layered casing with an air gap and asbestos lining that reduced the temperature of the outer layer. The casing rose at the top to form an outlet for hot gases into a funnel. The furnace was fed with coal by stokers through firebox doors at one end, and, whereas the Normand boiler required a fire of about 18inches (460mm) depth, the Reed boiler required a shallower one of between 8and 12inches (200–300mm). Air for the furnace passed through the air gap in the boiler casing, thus providing a supply of heated air that was directed {{to the rear of the}} <b>ashpan.</b> This admitted air through three doors that closed automatically if a tube failed, the intention being to prevent flames, steam and debris escaping into the boiler room. A constant supply of pure water was essential for this type of boiler, as a shortage of water would rapidly result in an empty boiler liable to severe damage from the furnace, and the deposition of any contaminant, such as limescale, would result in a significant loss of efficiency and could block tubes. Each boiler had its own feedwater pump, and a feedwater regulator also of Reed's design.|$|E
5000|$|They had a {{whole range}} of {{features}} such as piston valves, roller-type big-end and side-rod bearings, manganese steel axle-box and horn plate liners, hopper <b>ashpans,</b> self-cleaning smokeboxes, rocking grates and Lambets wet sanding. Steel fireboxes were used as well as [...] "Owens" [...] patent poppet valve and balanced regulator valves. As was usual for short-journey locomotives they were not fitted with superheating, as short journeys allow little time for the superheater elements to reach working temperature.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, Churchward's bar framed bogie {{which had}} been adapted for the {{original}} Hall prototype in 1924 {{was replaced by a}} plate frame structure with individual springing. There were changes, too, above the running board. Hawksworth decided that the declining quality of coal reaching Great Western depots necessitated a higher degree of superheating. A larger three-row superheater and header regulator were fitted into Swindon No.1 boiler. Improvements were subsequently made to the draughting on some engines, while others were fitted with hopper <b>ashpans.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{very large}} {{fire-grate}} area was provided, {{which gave the}} locomotive free-steaming qualities; its grate area was in fact larger than many later express passenger locomotives. Only the Baden IV h 4-6-2 and DRG Class 45 2-10-2 locomotives ever had larger fireboxes in Germany; even the record-breaking DRG Class 05 4-6-4s had fireboxes no larger than the S 2/6. This was partly because Bavarian coal was of lower quality than that available in Prussia and elsewhere. Large <b>ashpans</b> extended down {{on both sides of}} the locomotive, between the driving wheels and trailing truck, allowing for long runs before they needed to be emptied.|$|R
500|$|Other {{innovations}} by Maunsell's team included greater superheating surface area, {{locating the}} boiler water top feed inside a dome-like cover with external clackboxes and water feed pipes mounted on either side, outside Walschaerts valve gear, and parts {{that could be}} shared with similar locomotive classes to reduce maintenance costs. The firebox was narrower towards the rear and featured a continuously sloping grate, whilst the <b>ashpan</b> was fitted with front and rear damper doors, the latter adjusted to clear the rear driving axle. The {{lower part of the}} coal bunker incorporated a water tank of [...] capacity. This was connected to two [...] side tanks by two rectangular pipes {{on either side of the}} locomotive that also formed supports for the cab footplate.|$|E
500|$|The {{main problem}} was known {{even when the}} {{locomotive}} was under construction, as Mr. L.T. Daniels, {{the representative of the}} British Caprotti company, recommended the use of the Kylchap blastpipe, which could have coped with the fierce exhaust blasts experienced with the Caprotti system. A standard double chimney of the Swindon type had already been fabricated in order to cut costs and it had been installed in the smokebox supposedly before Riddles could do anything about it. [...] As a result, the locomotive suffered due to the choke area of both chimney and blastpipe being much too small for the pressure created by the exhaust, leading to poor draughting. Further problems regarding the firebox of the locomotive were only discovered during restoration, including a poorly dimensioned <b>ashpan</b> and dampers that were again too small, strangling the fire of air when operating at speed. Further, British Railways [...] "Modernization Plan" [...] was already under development concurrent with the construction of 71000 raising other questions.|$|E
2500|$|... and the New South Wales Railway AD 60 class 6042, {{asked if}} they could acquire the engine for display in their {{institution}} since it had been built in that city by Beyer, Peacock. By the time it was shipped to England, it was shorn of around two hundred parts including its right-hand-side <b>ashpan</b> and much of its brick arch.|$|E
5000|$|In 1869 Fairlie's company built a locomotive, named Little Wonder (Fairlie {{was not an}} {{individual}} given to modesty) for the Ffestiniog Railway, a slate hauler in north Wales, and this one {{proved to be an}} outstanding success. The Ffestiniog was the first locomotive-hauled narrow-gauge railway, with a gauge of [...] Particularly important for a gauge as small as this {{was the fact that the}} Fairlie design meant that the fireboxes and <b>ashpans</b> were not restricted by frame or track width, but only by the overall loading gauge. Little Wonder was such a success that Fairlie gave the Festiniog Railway Company a perpetual license to use the Fairlie patent without restriction in return for using the line and the success of its Fairlie locomotives in his publicity. The Ffestiniog went on to own a total of six Fairlie locomotives, with three in service in 2011, and one on display at the National Railway Museum.|$|R
5000|$|As {{mentioned}} in the previous paragraph The Victor/Vulcan 2994-6 locomotives were ordered by the Steel Company of Wales (SCOW) for their Abbey, Margam and Port Talbot works in 1950. They had {{a whole range of}} such as 18" [...] X 26" [...] cylinders, together with piston valves, roller-type big-end and side-rod bearings, manganese steel axle-box and horn plate liners, hopper <b>ashpans,</b> self-cleaning smokeboxes, rocking grates and Lambets wet sanding. Steel fireboxes were used as well as [...] "Owens" [...] patent poppet valve and balanced regulator valves. surprisingly the locomotives wasn't fitted with superheating and although the locomotives were powerful they weren't the most powerful as the Peckett OQ Class with 29,527 lbf of tractive effort was the most powerful while the 2994-6 locomotives only had 25,250 lbs of tractive effort. In later life 2994 and 2996 were sold to Austin Motor company and were named 'Victor' and 'Vulcan' [...] They ran until 1972 when the locos were preserved on the West Somerset Railway and currently run at the Stephenson Railway Museum and the Lakeside and Haverthwaite Railway. 2995 was sold to NCB at the same time for use at a colliery and was scrapped in 1967.|$|R
50|$|The firebox is {{of limited}} size though, {{and unlike the}} {{locomotive}} boiler cannot expand beyond {{the size of the}} boiler shell. This limits the sustained output that is possible. The grate and <b>ashpan</b> are also limited in size, the grate being a set of bars part-way across the furnace tube and the <b>ashpan</b> the restricted space beneath this. These features limit the boiler's ability to burn hard bituminous coal and they require a supply of Welsh steam coal, or similar, instead. Firebox capacity is further restricted by the space used for the <b>ashpan</b> and also by the dry-back furnace. The small <b>ashpan</b> also restricts their ability to steam for long periods.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: Heywood-designed Ursula at the Perrygrove Railway, {{showing the}} limited grate and <b>ashpan</b> size.|$|E
50|$|A {{limitation}} of this design for steam locomotives was the need to fit fire, grate and <b>ashpan</b> all within the confined circular furnace tube. This limited the radiative heating surface of the furnace, and thus the immediate steam-raising power of the boiler. They were noted as being slower to light from cold than conventional. As the <b>ashpan</b> space beneath the grate was small, locomotives could only operate {{for a short time}} before needing to rake out this <b>ashpan.</b> On a main line railway this would have required a return to the engine shed. On small narrow gauge contractor lines, the ash would simply be dumped wherever convenient and so this was much less of a drawback.|$|E
50|$|A steam {{operated}} firedoor was fitted, {{permitting the}} stoker {{to operate the}} door {{by means of a}} foot treadle, while an auxiliary operating handle allowed the driver to operate the door in situations where this was found more convenient. The <b>ashpan</b> was attached to the engine frame instead of to the boiler to enable the boiler to be removed from the frame without disturbing the <b>ashpan,</b> an innovation which became standard practice on the SAR.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ashpan</b> Annie (January 25, 1916 - July 18, 2010) was {{the name}} given to Halifax Explosion {{survivor}} Anne M. Welsh (née Liggins).|$|E
50|$|The inner firebox was {{of steel}} and was fitted with five 3 in {{diameter}} arch tubes, which supported the brick arch. The rocking grate, with two drop-grates, was actuated by a steam shaker. As was the practice with Watson Standard boilers, the hopper type <b>ashpan</b> was secured to the main frames instead of to the boiler foundation ring, with a 4 in air gap all round. Drench pipes were fitted to facilitate cleaning and {{the bottom of the}} <b>ashpan</b> was fitted with a hand-operated sliding door.|$|E
50|$|A {{space is}} left in {{the centre of the}} {{water-tube}} banks for the firing chute. The firebox is top-fired (and lit) through this chute and there is no side firedoor. The lower part of the water-jacketed barrel surrounds the firebox. The narrow waterspace here encourages rapid steam raising. Firing is simple, with a thick fire relative to its area and fuel simply poured down. Beneath the grate is a water-filled <b>ashpan,</b> to prevent hot embers falling onto the road. Draught is controlled by a damper {{in the side of the}} <b>ashpan,</b> between the grate and the water tray.|$|E
50|$|Innovative design {{features}} of the AA class included air sanding equipment, improved Gresham No. 9 injectors, horizontal grid spark arrestors, steam for auxiliaries supplied directly from the dome, and a sloped <b>ashpan</b> to provide easier cleaning.|$|E
5000|$|Its round-topped firebox {{was fitted}} with eight {{flexible}} cross-stays {{at the front}} end. The inner firebox was of steel instead of copper {{and it had a}} hopper type <b>ashpan,</b> fitted with an efficient arrangement of drench pipes. The <b>ashpan</b> doors were steam-operated with provision for hand operation when required. The finger bar fire grate was operated by two steam shaker cylinders and had two drop grates. The boiler pressure was [...] higher than that of the Class GE and it had a larger superheater area with 36 elements and incorporating a multiple valve regulator. The locomotive had a self-cleaning smokebox and was fitted with a spark arrester.|$|E
50|$|The Class GL had {{a rocking}} grate and {{self-cleaning}} hopper <b>ashpan</b> {{with water and}} steam sprayers to dampen down the ash {{to prevent it from}} entering axle boxes, motion areas and other friction-sensitive places. They had self-cleaning type smokeboxes and their axle boxes were grease-lubricated.|$|E
50|$|This {{consisted}} of a locomotive bar frame which was shorter to end {{at the front of}} the firebox, with a bridle casting to create a widened frame extension below the firebox and the cab to the rear dragbox to gain more <b>ashpan</b> room under the firebox.|$|E
50|$|The front {{carrying}} axle was simplified to a conventional Bissell truck, {{carried on a}} long radius pivot under the first driven axle, of almost 9 ft. The two rear driving axles were beneath the <b>ashpan,</b> although this early design {{does not make it}} clear how the small space here was managed. The Dreadnoughts had already suffered from a lack of air supply here.|$|E
50|$|This {{combustion}} chamber pre-dated the Gaines type, which was practically identical, by four years. The Gaines type {{was introduced in}} the United States of America in 1908 and became widely used on American locomotives. The firebox, of which the external dimensions were 9 ft long and 6 ft wide, was arranged with finger bars and drop grates with a hopper-type <b>ashpan.</b>|$|E
50|$|From 1983 to September 1988 the Indiana Transportation Museum leased a {{work area}} at Amtrak's Beech Grove Shops. During {{restoration}} {{the museum was}} surprised to find that when the welds holding the fire box doors closed (for safety purposes) were removed there were still ashes in the <b>ashpan.</b> This indicated that the locomotive was simply pulled from active service and stored until being donated to the city of Indianapolis.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were built}} with many LMS standard {{features such as}} a self-cleaning smokebox, rocking firegrate, self-emptying <b>ashpan,</b> side window cab and a simplified footplate together with others which followed NCC practice, such as a water top-feed on a parallel boiler (as opposed to the taper boilers {{being used by the}} LMS at the time), Dreadnought type vacuum brake gear, Detroit sight feed cylinder lubricator and a cast number plate.|$|E
50|$|Watson {{experienced}} considerable difficulty to {{keep the}} axle loads within the permissible limits specified by the Chief Civil Engineer, {{with the result that}} the <b>ashpan,</b> cab, side running boards and several other parts were made of thinner material than usual. Even the original number plates were cast in aluminium. Still, the axle load of 20 lt 19 lcwt kg was the heaviest of any engine or vehicle on the SAR at the time.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} she was 23 months old. Her brother Edwin and mother Anne were killed in the blast, which leveled most of the north Barrington Street structure. She was blown under the kitchen stove, where the still warm ashes in the <b>ashpan</b> kept her alive until she was rescued by a soldier, Sgt Davies and his dog along with a neighbour, Mr Henneberry, who was looking for his own family that had lived nearby some 26 hours later.|$|E
