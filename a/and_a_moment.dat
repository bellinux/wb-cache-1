He would {{assemble}} about 60 trucks, coaches and smaller vehicles and discuss with the non-commissioned officers how to hide these from the air. They would agree that a line of trucks could be parked by a hedge and all together draped with nets to appear as a thick belt of vegetation, or arrange a vehicle as a pitched-roof outhouse to a building. Then the commanders would arrive, and Barkas would give a speech about camouflage methods to defeat aerial reconnaissance. He would then signal the start, the unit would hide all its vehicles, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> later, using his film-making skill with timing, an aircraft would arrive and start observing. It rarely found more than a few of the vehicles.|$|E

"On {{the night}} before such an event neither Mamma, Pappa, or Daughter Gale could get those minutes' solid sleep for thought {{that they might have}} {{overlooked}} some essential in the guests' comfort. At the first crow of the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the larder into shape. So little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured - when the prize dish was a splendid homemade mince pie - the Gales were ever looking after the need of the said pie. First Mamma Gale would tiptoe to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state, and give it a stir; then Pappa Gale would tiptoe over and give it a stir; finally Daughter Gale would have to come over and honor it likewise. Then arrived the guests. The Minister and the Mrs. Minister, they were, and some neighbors. While she was receiving them the recollection came to Mamma Gale that the beloved mince pie had not received its flavoring. Off she speeds to a decanter of whiskey in the kitchen. She pours into the pie the right proportion of liquor, and goes back to her guests. Then Pappa Gale remembers that the pie has not been flavored. He, too, excuses himself <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred mince. No sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than Daughter Gale, who has just remembered about the forgotten flavoring, rushes in and makes for the whiskey. She pours 'the right proportion' in, too." ...|$|E

2500|$|Less than a {{week after}} his passing, Palmer's life was also celebrated by both teams at the Ryder Cup at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska, Minnesota, just outside the Twin Cities.

During the matches, the players paid tribute to Palmer, which included wearing a special logo, button and pin. Palmer's bag from the 1975 Ryder Cup was also placed on the first tee as a tribute. Palmer had won more than 22 Ryder Cup matches and had also captained Team USA to two victories, in addition to holding or being tied for the records for youngest captain, most career singles points and most points in a single Ryder Cup.

2500|$|... "Black or Blue" [...] is a {{song about}} racial {{intolerance}} and {{tells the story of}} a doomed interracial romance. Critics have likened the song to West Side Story. [...] "This Hollywood Life" [...] is the most aggressive song on the album. A standard rock song, it features a guitar riff throughout the verses and a guitar solo. John Harris of NME wrote: [...] "a record so couched in earth-shacking drama probably needs at least one spittle-flecked tantrum." [...] Anderson states that the song is about the [...] "seedier side of the music business," [...] where people are forced to debase themselves somewhat to succeed. [...] "New Generation" [...] is an up-tempo song, considered the most upbeat song on the album <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of [...] "sleek rock'n'roll." [...] One writer noted that Anderson sounds more like Bowie in [...] "New Generation" [...] than he did in previous songs that drew similar comparisons. [...] "The Asphalt World" [...] is the longest song on the album and considered its centrepiece. It is a slow-tempo rock ballad partly influenced by Pink Floyd, with one of Butler's longest guitar solos. Its lyrics convey deviancy and sexual jealousy as Anderson revealed the song's lyrics could have been lifted entirely from his own diary. The song uses one of Anderson's familiar lyrical themes of hired/rented cars.|$|E
