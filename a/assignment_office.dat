50|$|A key {{focus of}} the PS2000 was {{increasing}} {{the flexibility of the}} public service. This flexibility would be codified in the Public Service Reform Act, 1992 which allowed managers to laterally transfer employees to other departments to assist where needed. Although employee consent is required to do so, and usefulness of this is limited, it did allow for shuffling of manpower around departments should it be needed. The task force also recommended the establishment of <b>assignment</b> <b>offices</b> to coordinate interdepartmental deployment: many departments have now done this. As well, the culture change sought by the PS2000 to allow for experimentation and goal-oriented service seems to have taken hold, with 3 out of 4 public servants stating they feel that they have the flexibility to adapt their services to meet their clients' needs.|$|R

The paper recommended that ZOU management should increase the number of ICT technical personnel, and increasing access to the internet by installing of more internet service points in the regions...|$|R
