40|$|One {{of the big}} {{problems}} of chemical analysis is to ensure its quality and to increase the confidence in the analytical results yielded by a chemical or instrumental analysis. The new internal norms for animal products quality (ANSVSA order 51 / 2005 regarding {{the performance of the}} analytical methods of analysis and data interpretation), aligned to EU requirements, required a unique system of inspection. These requirements stipulate the obligation of the laboratories inspecting animal products to validate each assay method, adapted to the particular type of sample. We therefore aimed to validate the chromatographic method of determining the linoleic acid from meat products. The parameters determined for the validation of this method were in agreement with SR EN ISO/CEI 17025 : 2005 and refer to: accuracy, reproducibility, sensitivity, precision, limit of detection and limit of quantification. For validation we only used reference materials and certified standards of <b>analytical</b> <b>purity.</b> We also calculated the incertitude for the validated method. The control diagrams obtained during two months show that the 0. 01176 reproducibility of the equipment was higher than the repeatability (r) of 0. 0079; 95. 60 % tracing and ± 0. 69 µg/g incertitude for linoleic acid determination.

40|$|Considering the new norms in feed quality {{checking}} (ANSVSA Order 51 / 2005 on {{the performance}} of the analytical methods and data interpretation), which are aligned to the European norms, the market for feeds implemented a checking system similar to the one for the food industry. These requirements stipulate that the laboratories for feed control must have validated methods for each sample assay. We therefore proposed to validate two chromatographic methods (HPLC and GC) for vitamin E and linolenic acid from the polyunsaturated fatty acids-enriched feeds for layers supplemented with 250 ppm vitamin E. The determined parameters were in agreement with SR EN ISO / CEI 17025 : 2005 as follows: exactness, reproducibility, sensitivity, accuracy, detection limit, quantification limit. We used for validation only certified reference materials and blanks, of <b>analytical</b> <b>purity.</b> We determined the incertitude for each validated method. We worked on two types of compound feeds for layers enriched in polyunsaturated fatty acids (I); with addition of flax seeds and with enriched linolenic acid (II).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to emphasize the fact that while consistent interest has been paid to the industrial use of chitosan, minor attention has been devoted to spread the knowledge of a good characterization of its physico-chemical properties. Therefore, the paper attempts to critically comment on the conflicting experimental results, highlighting the facts, the myths and the controversies. The goal is to indicate how to take advantage of chitosan versatility, to learn how to manage its variability and show how to properly tackle some unexpected undesirable features. In the sections of the paper various issues that relate chitosan properties to some basic features and to advanced solutions and applications are presented. The introduction outlines some historical pioneering works, where the chemistry of chitosan was originally explored. Thereafter, particular reference is made to <b>analytical</b> <b>purity,</b> characterization and chain modifications. The macromolecular characterization is mostly related to molecular weight and to degree of acetylation, but also refers to the conformational and rheological properties and solution stability. Then, the antimicrobial activity of chitosan in relation with its solubility is reviewed. A section is dedicated to the formulation of chitosan biomaterials, from gel to nanobeads, exploring their innovative application as active carrier nanoparticles. Finally, the toxicity issue of chitosan as a polymer and as a constructed nanomaterial is briefly commented in the conclusions...|$|E
30|$|The {{behavioral}} {{response of}} L. serricorne adults to citronellal, citral, and rutin was evaluated {{by using the}} area preference method. Test areas consisted of Whatman No. 1 filter paper cut in half (Ф 12.5  cm). A series of citronellal or citral was respectively dissolved in ethanol (<b>analytical</b> <b>purity)</b> {{at the rate of}} 1 : 10, 1 : 50, 1 : 100 and 1 : 1000 (citronellal or citral: ethanol, v/v). Then the corresponding 500  µl solution was evenly applied on half-filter paper discs using a micropipette, respectively. The other half of the remaining filter paper was treated with 500  µl ethanol alone and used as a control. The filter papers were air-dried for about 5  min to evaporate the solvent completely and full discs were subsequently remade by attaching treated halves to untreated halves with clear adhesive tape. Each remade filter paper disc was tightly fixed onto the bottom of a petri dish (Ф 12.5  cm) daubed with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)on the inside wall to prevent the insects from escaping. For the rutin, the appropriate amount of powder was evenly spreaded on the half filter paper (Ф 12.5  cm) according to the rate of 10, 30 and 90  g/m 2. The other half of the remaining filter paper was untreated as a control. Twenty unsexed L. serricorne adults were then released {{at the center of the}} filter paper disc.

30|$|All the {{chemical}} reagents used as reference substances {{and for the}} preparation of microbiological media were of <b>analytical</b> <b>purity</b> (Avantor Performance Materials, Poland). One type of microbiological media was bought as ready made-to-order preparations (BTL, Poland). The second one was prepared in a laboratory. The ordered medium contained neither organic carbon nor nitrogen nor sulphur that could be available for fungi, as it was assumed {{on the basis of}} the list of ingredients provided by the manufacturer. However, the absence of these elements was confirmed indirectly by inoculating the selected species of moulds on this medium (without an organic material sample). No growth was observed after 2  weeks of incubation. The goal of the experiment was to ensure that the main nutrient for moulds was the model organic materials, which was placed on the surface of the medium. Firstly, this was a way to confirm that the chosen mould really has the cellulolytic or proteolytic activity (when it can grow on cellulose, silk, parchment or wool substrate, respectively). Furthermore, the application of media without organic nutrients makes it very probable that the volatiles emitted by moulds originated mostly from the enzymatic decomposition of the organic material and not from the metabolism of sugar which is usually in the media. Media were prepared in the shape of a slope (using 5  ml of medium) inside 20  ml sterile vials designed for headspace (HS) sampling. One type of medium used for cultivation of moulds was a modified version of Weary and Canby’s medium (W&C) [33, 34]. The second type of medium was a modified version of Czapek–Dox medium (Cz&D–BTL, Poland).|$|E
