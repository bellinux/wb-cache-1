5|$|Should players take damage, {{they lose}} a life. Players can {{recharge}} their health by collecting cookies. Throughout the game, players can gather Specter Coins, {{which can be}} found in hidden locations in each stage. Collecting enough Specter Coins unlocks three bonus mini-games: Ski Kidz Racing, a skiing game in which players race against opponents; Galaxy Monkey, a shoot 'em up where players fight against aliens; and Specter Boxing, a boxing game where players dodge <b>and</b> <b>punch</b> using the analog sticks.|$|E
5|$|These {{moves are}} {{designed}} to be used in flurry combinations. For instance, the player can Seismic Slam an opponent, which pulls in enemies, and progress into a Rising Uppercut, which tosses the opponent into the air. During that toss, the player can charge the Rocket Punch and release as the opponent returns to the ground. Alternatively, the player can launch into the air, pick an opponent to slam, <b>and</b> <b>punch</b> them at close range. The character is built for aggressive playstyles and advanced players.|$|E

On the Intermediary Version programs were input by key switches, and the output was displayed {{as a series of}} dots and dashes on a cathode ray tube known as the output device, just as on the SSEM from which the Mark 1 had been developed. However, the Final Specification machine, completed in October 1949, benefitted from the addition of a teleprinter with a 5-hole paper-tape reader <b>and</b> <b>punch.</b>|$|E
