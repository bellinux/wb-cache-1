5|$|After {{the first}} time the player defeats the Elite Four, one of the members, Lorelei, disappears. After gaining access to the Sevii Islands, an entirely new region, the player discovers Lorelei in her house and convinces her to come back with him. Once more, the protagonist must thwart the Team Rocket's plans on several occasions, recover two artifacts, the Ruby and the Sapphire, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> the main {{computer}} at One Island. After that, the player can communicate, battle, trade, etc., with Ruby and Sapphire.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{now hold}} {{that there was}} likely no {{cross-pollination}} between the Revolt of the Lash and these subsequent revolts. The formerly mutinous Minas Geraes, {{under the command of}} João Cândido after the officers abandoned the ship, used a hidden-away gun (as the ship had otherwise been disarmed after the Revolt of the Lash) to fire on the marine infantry and demonstrate their loyalty. Even so, the government and navy, fueled by anger over their lost honor, used this opportunity to round up the remaining amnestied sailors <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> prison.|$|E

5|$|The basic close combat from {{previous}} installments has been heavily refined and expanded into the CQC system. When unarmed or using a one-handed weapon, Snake can grab opponents <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> a chokehold, {{at which point}} a variety of actions can be performed, such as choking the enemy unconscious, slitting the enemy's throat, or interrogating them at knifepoint to obtain information. The context, pressure applied to the button, and movement of the analog stick determine the action performed.|$|E
5|$|While caddisflies in {{the wild}} {{construct}} their cases out of twigs, sand, aquatic plants, and rocks, the French artist Hubert Duprat makes art by providing wild caddisflies with precious stones and other materials. He collected caddisfly larvae from the wild <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> climate-controlled tanks. He removes the larvae from their original cases and adds precious and semi-precious items such as grains of gold into the tank. The larvae then build new cases out of precious items, creating a unique form of artwork. The resulting works are sold across the world.|$|E
5|$|Haywood {{observed}} {{how the government}} frequently took the side of business to defeat the tactics and the aspirations of the miners. During an 1899 organizing drive in Coeur d'Alene, with pay cuts as a motivating issue, the company hired spies and then fired organizers and pro-union miners. Some frustrated miners responded with violence and when two men were killed, martial law was declared. As they had done in a strike in Coeur d'Alene seven years earlier, soldiers acted as strike breakers. They rounded up hundreds of union members without formal charges <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> a filthy, vermin-infested warehouse without sanitation services for a year. They were so crowded that the soldiers locked the overflow of prisoners in boxcars. One local union leader was imprisoned for 17 years.|$|E

5|$|I {{started doing}} {{different}} charity events where I did {{a combination of}} 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero'. We made it into a medley <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> the same key and made it work. People responded really well to it. It's been interesting for me, since the events of September11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and really even {{talking to me about}} 'Never Too Far', 'cause that song is also about loss. I figured {{that it would be a}} nice thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment. The proceeds from 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero' and 'There for Me' are going to go to the Heroes Fund, and it's going to benefit police officers' families, relief workers' families.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{began his}} final tour to England in 1961, and Benaud's regular {{absences}} {{due to a}} shoulder injury allowed him to lead Australia for {{a third of the}} tour matches. This included most of the first month of the tour; Benaud hurt his shoulder in the first match against Worcestershire, and spent most of the next three weeks either not bowling or travelling to London away from his men for specialist treatment. At one stage, Australia were left with only 10 men on the field when Benaud excused himself and his replacement succumbed to illness, requiring an Englishman to stand in. Harvey scored 474 runs at 47.40 in eight matches leading up to the Tests, including centuries against Lancashire and Glamorgan. It seemed that Harvey would captain Australia in a Test {{for the first time with}} Benaud's shoulder still problematic, but the captain declared himself fit. Harvey then made 114 in the drawn First Test at Edgbaston. This helped Australia take a 321-run first innings lead <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> control of the match, but the hosts batted for the remainder of the match to stave off defeat; Benaud's shoulder prevented him from bowling more than nine overs.|$|E
5|$|He {{is always}} there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course {{the only time we}} ever get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E

The Israeli government also took extreme measures against Palestinians following the massacre, banning them from certain streets in Hebron, such as Al-Shuhada Street, where many Palestinians have homes and businesses, and opening them to the exclusive access of Jewish Israelis and foreign tourists.|$|E
25|$|When Gandhari's {{pregnancy}} {{continued for}} an unusually {{long period of}} time, she beat her womb in frustration. This caused a hardened mass of grey-coloured flesh to issue from her womb.

25|$|On 12 September 1939 in Abbeville {{a conference}} {{took place in}} which France and the United Kingdom decided {{it was too late}} to send troops to help Poland in its fight against Germany. On 9 May 1940, {{authorities}} in Belgium arrested a number of both far right and far left activists <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> custody of a French Army unit stationed near Abbeville. On 20 May, when the advancing German Army cut off the area (see following), a group of French soldiers carried out a massacre and killed a number of members of the right wing Verdinaso and Rexist Party and of the Belgian Communist Party. Altogether, twenty two suspects of varying political stripe were selected and executed without trial.|$|E
25|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of testing infrastructure has been largely prompted {{by the introduction of}} provider-initiated routine testing campaigns to identify infected individuals <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> contact with treatment services. Client-initiated testing was failing to identify most infected individuals, so campaigns to screen high-risk groups, including drug users, commercial sex workers, prisoners, and former plasma donors, were commissioned to link patients to treatment services. The campaigns have resulted in a substantial {{increase in the number of}} individuals who know their HIV status, with an additional 60,000 people living with HIV/AIDS identified. This increased identification explains, at least in part, the rapid rise in reported HIV cases in the early 21st century. However, even with this effort, only about 22% of the estimated 650,000 HIV-infected individuals living in China at the end of 2005 have been identified. Routine testing in high-risk groups continues.|$|E
25|$|For {{his first}} {{exhibition}} in USA, at the Eugenia Butler Gallery of Los Angeles (1970), he exhibited {{a series of}} 37 suitcases filled with cheese on the floor, below pictures made with cheese on the wall. Called Staple Cheese (A Race), a pun on Steeple Chase, the suitcases were to be opened one a day, whilst the wall pictures included a horizontal line tracking the vertical movement of the cheeses as they slid toward it. However, {{within a few days}} the over-powering smell, maggots and flies combined to make it impossible to enter the room. As a gesture to honor what he called “the exhibition’s true audience,” Roth collected some of the dead flies lying {{on the floor of the}} gallery space <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> a glass jar. The suitcases were later stored in a container designed by Roth for a number of years until Butler's husband threw the whole exhibition away in the desert.|$|E
