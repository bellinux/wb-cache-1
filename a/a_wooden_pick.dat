5000|$|Ziryab {{is said to}} have {{improved}} the Oud (or Laúd) by adding a fifth pair of strings, and using an eagle's beak or quill instead of <b>a</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>pick.</b> Ziryab also dyed the four strings a color to symbolize the Aristotelian humors, and the fifth string to represent the soul. [...] He {{is said to have}} created a unique and influential style of musical performance, and written songs that were performed in Iberia for generations. He was a great influence on Spanish music, and is considered the founder of the Andalusian music traditions of North Africa.|$|E
50|$|Bronze disease {{ranges from}} vivid green to pastel green. It is {{commonly}} {{present in all}} colours in this range due to the series of reactions that cause it and {{there may also be}} tiny, possibly microscopic, blue crystals. Bronze disease typically affects isolated patches of the object in severe cases being a visibly and tactilely raised bloom of microscopic crystals as well as being associated with pitting. The patches of bronze disease can be scraped off the surface using a fingernail or <b>a</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>pick.</b> These properties are all in comparison with verdigris, which is normally a duller shade, uniform across the whole of the affected object, and cannot be scratched off with wood or fingernails. Unlike bronze disease, verdigris serves to protect the metal.|$|E
50|$|Each {{guitar pick}} {{made of wood}} has its own unique {{properties}} and signature sound {{as a result of}} differences in density, hardness and cellular structure. Most wood picks produce a warmer tone than plastics or metals. To withstand the rigors of picking and strumming only the hardest woods are used for picks—including hardwoods like African Blackwood, Bocote, Cocobolo, Lignum vitae, Rosewood, and Zebrawood. While the thick and sometimes rough edge of <b>a</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>pick</b> may create a fair amount of drag at first, wooden picks are generally easy to break in and may even do so quicker than plastic picks. After a couple of hundred strokes, the metal guitar strings wear down the edge and create a smoother pass over the strings.|$|E

50|$|He {{is said to}} {{have been}} a weaver and the {{supposed}} house he lived is now converted to a temple. His wife's name is Vaasuki.There are lots of legends about the pair Thiruvalluvar and Vaasuki. Two of them are: 1) Once Vaasuki Ammaiyar was fetching water from well and Thiruvalluvar called her and she left the water and ran in immediately, but the water pot stayed in mid air. Such was her austerity and dedication towards her husband Thiruvalluvar; 2) Thiruvalluvar used to sit every day for meal with a cup of water and <b>a</b> <b>wooden</b> tooth <b>pick.</b> He did this to pick any grain of rice spilled out from his leaf when Vaasuki Ammaiyar served food. It was said that Thiruvalluvar could not even pick a grain of rice every day. Such was the dedication in serving meal by Vaasuki Ammaiyar.Thiruvalluvar may have spent part of his life in Madurai because it was under the Pandiya rulers that many Tamil poets flourished. There is also the recent claim by Kanyakumari Historical and Cultural Research Centre (KHCRC) that Valluvar was a king who ruled Valluvanadu in the hilly tracts of the Kanyakumari District of Tamil Nadu.|$|R
5000|$|The sarod {{is widely}} {{believed}} to have descended from the Afghan rubab, a similar instrument originating in Central Asia and Afghanistan. Many scholars of Indian classical music believe that sarod {{is a combination of}} the ancient Chitra veena, the medieval Rabab and modern Sursingar. Some scholars even contend that a similar instrument may have existed about two thousand years ago in ancient India during the ages of the Gupta kings. In fact, a Gupta period coin depicts the great king Samudragupta playing a Veena, which many believe to be the precursor of the Sarod.The origin of most of the present Indian classical instruments along with the Sitar, Sarod and others lie in the ancient Indian instruments. They had the practice of adding the word Veena to every instrument like the Rudra Veena, Gayatri Veena, Saraswati Veena, Chitra Veena, Sarda Veena etc.The shape and appearance of the present Indian musical Instruments like the Sitar and Sarode with the decorated domes are exactly like the ancient musical instruments the Veenas. The Sarod originated from Sarda Veena, modified with time.There is a small Indian musical instrument also like a small sarod named Dotara which is quite ancient.As in the case of everything the present is only related to the ancient period, the origin of the present Indian musical instruments are related to the musical instruments of the past, the several Veenas..(Pg 6, Indian musical Instruments written by Sarodia Abanindra Maitra) [...]The present Indian Traces of similar Rabab style instruments can also be found in southern India, especially in the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, where it is known as the Swarbat. The folk Rabab, an instrument popular in north India, had a wooden fingerboard, its strings were made of silk, cotton or gut, and it was played with <b>a</b> <b>wooden</b> <b>pick.</b> In history, reference is also made to a Sharadiya Veena from which the name Sarod may have been derived.|$|E
50|$|At The Nightrise headquarters, <b>a</b> <b>wooden</b> sampan <b>picked</b> {{up by the}} typhoon smashes {{into the}} Chairman's office and {{ironically}} kills the Chairman.

Scott and Pedro travel through the door and the last Old One agent aims at Jamie, but Scott pushes him out of the way and the bullet hits Scarlett in the head, rendering her unconscious. Without Scarlett to hold the typhoon back, it unleashes its full strength on them and disintegrates the temple. Jamie and Scott, Richard and Scarlett, Pedro, and Matt and Lohan dash through the door moments before the temple is destroyed, escaping the typhoon. Then the storm finally abates, revealing Hong Kong completely destroyed (although all the pollution was swept away). All of the Five are separated all over the world with their partners, due to having no preassumed destination decided between all of them, also it is said that since the door collapsed as they were going through it, one final trick was played on them. Meanwhile, Chaos, the King of the Old Ones, prepares to commence the war to conquer the planet and wipe out humanity.|$|R
