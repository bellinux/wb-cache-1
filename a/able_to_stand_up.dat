5|$|On December 2, 2000, he was {{scheduled}} to fight in a unification card against Fernando Vargas, the International Boxing Federation's junior middleweight champion. The fight began in a fast pace with Trinidad connecting a solid combination that led to his opponent being knocked down. Vargas was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up,</b> but another combination injured him a second time and led to another knockdown. Early in the second round Trinidad was in the offensive but Vargas connected a solid combination at the round's closing moments which opened a cut over Trinidad's right eye. In the fourth round's opening seconds one of Vargas' punches connected on Trinidad's jaw and he fell, marking the eighth knockdown in his career. In the fifth round Vargas was in control of the fight's offensive, connecting combinations to Trinidads' body. In the sixth round Trinidad regained control of the fight's tempo that lasted throughout the contest, connecting punches on Vargas' head and left jabs to the ribs. In the eighth, Vargas displayed signs of exhaustion which slowed his offensive while Trinidad then pursued the offense with combinations to the body. This pattern continued throughout the ninth, tenth and eleventh rounds. Opening the final round Vargas was on the offensive, connecting a solid left hook. Trinidad countered the attack with a left hook that made Vargas collapse; Vargas was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up,</b> but was subsequently knocked down for a second time. With Vargas injured, Trinidad continued connecting combinations, until the referee stopped the fight by technical knockout.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{recapture}} of Constantinople a {{few months}} later however, Michael VIII was able to focus his attention on building up his own fleet. In the early 1260s, the Byzantine navy was still weak, and depended still greatly on Genoese aid. Even so, the allies were not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> to Venice in a direct confrontation, as evidenced by the defeat of a combined Byzantine–Genoese fleet of 48 ships by a much smaller Venetian fleet in 1263. Taking advantage of the Italians' preoccupation with the ongoing Venetian–Genoese war, by 1270 Michael's efforts had produced a strong navy of 80 ships, with several Latin privateers sailing under imperial colours. In the same year, a fleet of 24 galleys besieged the town of Oreos in Negroponte (Euboea), and defeated a Latin fleet of 20 galleys. This marked the first successful independent Byzantine naval operation and the beginning of an organized naval campaign in the Aegean that would continue throughout the 1270s and would result in the recapture, albeit briefly, of many islands from the Latins.|$|E

5|$|On 12 May, Baroness Symons, {{a junior}} {{minister}} in the MoD, told the House of Lords that British forces would remain in Sierra Leone, mainly to ensure the security of Lungi airport while UNAMSIL brought in reinforcements. Soldiers also remained at the evacuation point in Freetown to ensure its security, while others patrolled the streets of Freetown {{in an attempt to}} reassure residents. HMS Illustrious, with her air group, and the ARG both arrived on 14 May, bringing the number of British personnel in the operational area to approximately 4,500. Harriers from Illustrious began flying reassurance patrols over Freetown and the ARG supplemented British firepower, particularly at Lungi, with the provision of artillery. In the field, the British forces divided their efforts between three lines of operation: support to UNAMSIL, support to the SLA, and preparation to provide humanitarian assistance, should it be necessary, though the expanded mandate only became formal government policy several days later. During the following week, the RUF began to remobilise in the north of the country. The UN and the Sierra Leonean government feared that UNAMSIL troops between the RUF and Freetown might not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> to an assault by the RUF, and so the RAF Chinooks—in the country to conduct the evacuation—were used to ferry reinforcements from Lungi as they arrived. Meanwhile, President Ahmad Kabbah formed an alliance of militia groups (including the self-styled Civil Defence Force and the West Side Boys) and the remnants of the SLA, totalling around 6,000 personnel, to assist UNAMSIL forces in blocking the RUF advance. The British also provided reconnaissance for UNAMSIL using ground-based signals and intelligence personnel and special forces as well as flights by Harriers and a Nimrod R1.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The present {{contribution}} {{reports on}} the rheological investigations concerning influence of high hydrostatic pressure on the molecular structure of gelatin gels. For {{the purpose of the}} study, a torsional shear wave rheometer for in-situ investigations of viscoelastic substances under high pressure was developed. Small amplitude vibrations generated by piezoelectric elements are used to determine the storage modulus of the investigated medium. The system is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> pressures <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 300 MPa. The experiments have been carried out with household gelatin (0. 1 w/w aqueous solution). The gelification curves revealed similar time course. However, the values of G 0 obtained for the gels curing 300 minutes under 100 MPa and 200 MPa were observed to be respectively 2. 1 and 4 times higher than at ambient conditions. The increased number of triple helix junction zones is hypothesised to be the cause of this phenomenon as a result of reinforcement of the hydrogen bonds due to pressure. An attempt to cognize the characteristic dimensions of the molecular structure based on the theory of rubber elasticity is made. Key words: high hydrostatic pressure, in-situ measurement techniques, rheology, gelification, gelatin, molecular structure. 1...|$|R

Luevano used his speed to employ a constant jab during the second round, working on counter-punches, which left him open to a combination to end that stage. López began pursuing the offensive during the third round, employing combinations and pursuing Luevano, who attempted to counter. This pattern persisted during the following two rounds.

40|$|In this essay, I {{consider}} {{the role that}} a country’s stage of development plays in their choice of intellectual property rights (IPRs). Past empirical observations on a panel of countries over time indicate {{that the relationship between}} IPRs and per capita GDP is U-shaped, suggesting IPRs initially decrease and later increase as per capita GDP increases. When considering the relationship between IPRs and per capita GDP at the country level, however, a U-shape relationship simply does not follow intuition. More specifically, the downward portion of the U-shape relationship is contradictory. Countries generally maintain or increase IPRs over time and, therefore, a similar trend is expected as a country progresses through stages of development. As a result, I postulate that longitudinal interpretations of the panel data lead to inaccurate expla-nations of a country’s choice in IPRs. The well-known U-shape between IPRs and per capita GDP is instead a result of cross-country differences. Cross-sectionally, the least developed countries are less <b>able</b> and willing <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> against international pressures to implement strong patent rights, while middle-income developing countries have a greater ability to oppose such pressures and, therefore, implement weaker patent rights. Establishing clarity in the true relationship between IPRs and per capita GDP will enable researchers to accurately estimate the effects of IPRs when using panel data...|$|R
40|$|The {{protection}} of individuals' rights, often necessary {{against their own}} states, may sometimes also be necessary against international organizations. This is a particularly delicate matter where the international organization is meant to represent international law and justice. Drawing {{on the experience of}} the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the author argues that the operations of the International Criminal Court will inevitably have a direct and significant impact on the treatment of individuals in countries that are not <b>able</b> or willing <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> for their citizens' rights and interests under state laws or international law. The interface of the ICC with the ordinary state national is generally not regulated by the ICC's statute and rules (just as it is not by the ICTY's) and, in the absence of regular and effective state protections, constitutes a lawless frontier at which the court is potentially all-powerful and the individual is at its mercy. The strong state/weak state divide (along with that of citizens enjoying correspondingly strong/weak legal protections) offers the ICC opportunities for evidence-gathering, but also risks damage to the Court's moral standing and reputation for justice. The author concludes that the ICC needs to institute, at the very least, a policy that foresees such situations and aims to maintain a balance of rights and interests in the relationship of international court and private citizen. 21 page(s...|$|R

While showing immense growth (CAGR of 6,1% in volume and 5,8% in value between 2011 and 2014), the distribution of <b>Stand</b> <b>Up</b> Pouches in Brazil yet lags behind the Chilean and the U.S. market, which is {{due to a lack of}} supply of scale of important components like resealable zippers and nylon, causing the price for the production of <b>Stand</b> <b>Up</b> Pouches <b>to</b> be higher than in comparable markets. Among the ten fastest growing flexibles, <b>Stand</b> <b>Up</b> Pouches rank third with regard to CAGR in volume and fourth as regards CAGR in value.There are two common types of processes of filling <b>Stand</b> <b>Up</b> Pouches, namely vertical form fill seal (VFFS) and fill-seal (FS). Whereas the former uses rolls of film of the packaging material and complex machines that shape the pouch in its typical form before filling and eventually sealing it, the latter process uses pre-formed pouches as well as two separate machines for filling and sealing the pouch, respectively. Because of the trade-off of having a high initial investment but low operational costs, VFFS is more of a long-run rather than short-run option and useful for the production of large quantities. However, as the FS process is more decentralized than the VFFS process and does not rely on one extensive machine, the chance of suffering from long downtimes for maintenance is significantly lower with FS, since failures in single production processes can be fixed more easily.|$|R

It’s {{very hard to}} take full advantage of the huge amount of energy hitting the earth each day from the sun. The suns highest radiation appears often when the energy need reaches its lowest. That’s why it’s very important <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> store energy over time when the sun doesn’t shine. A large part of energy storage is thermal energy storage, which can either be done sensible, latent or chemical. Another possible thermal storage is a combination of sensible and latent. This exam was aiming to investigate different types of energy storage methods available on the market and a much more detailed analysis for different storage methods with phase change materials (PCM). A new method was designed for a new storage tank suitable for Absolicon Solar Collector AB and their energy park in the city of Härnösand. The methods for this exam were to create a theoretical storage tank suitable to Absolicons Energy Park with some simple calculations. The criteria for the storage tank was to create a storage tank that could provide the district heat in Härnösand with 160 degrees pressurized water and create 160 degrees steam to the industry. The dimensions of the storage tank where chosen by the conditions in Härnösand and from the specific data of Härnösands district heat and from Absolicons new solar collectors. The work temperature of the system were set to 160 degrees which meant that the storage tank would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> work in those conditions with high temperature. A suitable phase change material and methods for encapsulation of the phase change material suitable for this system was to be found. Small tests were made with a new type of encapsulation for phase change materials in higher temperature. Simple calculations of two types of storage tanks were made. The first storage tank was made with a PCM from PCM products named A 164. This PCM was encapsulated with special bags that could handle temperature up to 200 degrees with surrounding rapeseed oil and a copper loop that handled the heat transfer. The second thank was made with the same PCM and encapsulation but with water glycol surrounding the PCM and two types of heat exchangers for the heat transfer. The results from the first tank were that it didn’t work with the district heat. Because a wrong calculation with the schematic of the system made it impossible to connect into the district heat of Härnösand. The only good thing was that it didn’t need to be pressurized because of the rapeseed oil but the bad heat transfer between oil and water made a pressurized tank of water more profitable. The results from the second tank showed that it could produce 160 °C to the district heat for 2 h and 7 minutes. The schematic connection worked and the tank would in the near future be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> connect into the district heat. The result for the encapsulation showed that the bags were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> temperatures <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 190 degrees for a short period of time. ...|$|R
