5|$|With two authors at {{the time}} Holmes {{decided to have a}} {{pseudonym}} since having two <b>authors</b> <b>would</b> place the books at different places at libraries, confusing and possibly scaring off potential readers. The last name Hunter was chosen since it put the books next to the Redwall series which has a similar genre.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, revisionist <b>authors</b> <b>would</b> {{formulate}} {{accusations against}} Moreno, depicting {{him as a}} British agent and a man of mere theoretical European ideas without a strong relation with the South American context. Saavedra is depicted instead as a popular caudillo, a predecessor of José de San Martín and Juan Manuel de Rosas. This perspective did not acknowledge that the wealthy citizens were aligned with Saavedra against Moreno, that Saavedra himself was wealthy and aristocratic, and that the 1811 revolution made no requests of a social nature, save {{for the removal of}} Morenist forces from the Junta.|$|E
5|$|In ensuing years, {{many other}} <b>authors</b> <b>would</b> publish books {{containing}} Wicca in their titles which advocated solitary practice of Pagan Witchcraft; best known were Scott Cunningham's Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner (1988) and Silver RavenWolf's Teen Witch: Wicca for a New Generation (1998), but other examples included Gerina Dunwich's The Wicca Garden (1996), D. J. Conway's Wicca: The Complete Craft (2001), Raymond Buckland's Wicca for Life (2004) and Wicca for One (2004), Arin Murphy-Hiscock's Solitary Wicca for Life (2005) and Ann-Marie Gallagher's The Wicca Bible (2005). It was also adopted by American novelist Cate Tiernan {{as the title}} of her series of young adult novels.|$|E

5|$|The essay {{begins by}} declaring that anarchists had {{correctly}} resisted the war from its inception, {{and that the}} <b>authors</b> <b>would</b> prefer a peace brought about by an international conference of European workers. It then submits that German workers would most likely also favor such a conclusion to the war, and presents several reasons why {{it would be in}} their best interest to call for an armistice. These reasons were that the citizens, after twenty months of war, would understand that they had been deceived into believing they were taking part in a defensive war; that they would recognize that the German state had long prepared for such a conflict, and as such it would be inevitably at fault; that the German Empire could not logistically support an occupation of the territory it had captured; and that the individuals living in the occupied territories were free to choose whether or not they would like to be annexed.|$|E
5|$|The first {{remarkable}} historiographical {{school of}} {{interpretation of the}} history of Argentina was founded by members of the 1837 generation, including Bartolomé Mitre. Mitre regarded the May Revolution as an iconic expression of political egalitarianism: a conflict between modern freedoms and oppression represented by the Spanish monarchy, and an attempt to establish a national organization on constitutional principles as opposed to the charismatic authority of the caudillos. These authors' views were treated as canonical {{until the end of the}} 19thcentury, when the proximity of the centennial encouraged authors to seek new perspectives. The newer <b>authors</b> <b>would</b> differ about the relative weight of the causes of the May Revolution and about whose intervention in the events was more decisive, but the main views expressed by Mitre were kept, such as to consider the revolution to be the birth of modern Argentina and an unavoidable event. These authors introduced the idea of popular intervention as another key element. By the time of the World Wars, liberal authors attempted to impose an ultimate and unquestionable historical perspective; Ricardo Levene and the Academia Nacional de la Historia were exponents of this tendency, which still kept most perspectives of Mitre. Left-wing authors took a revisionist view based on nationalism and anti-imperialism; they minimized the dispute between criollos and peninsulars and portrayed events as a dispute between enlightenment and absolutism. However, most of their work was focused on other historical periods.|$|E
25|$|From this point, Latin was the {{preferred}} language for presenting De Materia Medica, and Ruel's editions {{became the basis}} from which many other important <b>authors</b> <b>would</b> start {{to create their own}} Materia Medica.

25|$|Non-scholarly literature, however, {{continued}} {{to rely on}} adaptation. France's Pléiade, England's Tudor poets, and the Elizabethan translators adapted themes by Horace, Ovid, Petrarch and modern Latin writers, forming a new poetic style on those models. The English poets and translators sought to supply a new public, created {{by the rise of}} a middle class and the development of printing, with works such as the original <b>authors</b> <b>would</b> have written, had they been writing in England in that day.|$|E
25|$|The Scriblerian club most {{consistently}} comprised Jonathan Swift, John Gay, John Arbuthnot, Robert Harley, and Thomas Parnell. The group met {{during the}} spring and summer of 1714. One group project was to write a satire of contemporary abuses in learning of all sorts, in which the <b>authors</b> <b>would</b> combine their efforts to write the biography of the group's fictional founder, Martin Scriblerus, through whose writings they would accomplish their satirical aims. The resulting The Memoirs of Martin Scriblerus contained a number of parodies of the most lavish mistakes in scholarship.|$|E

25|$|Pulp covers {{were printed}} in color on higher-quality (slick) paper. They were {{famous for their}} half-dressed damsels in distress, usually {{awaiting}} a rescuing hero. Cover art played a major part in the marketing of pulp magazines. The early pulp magazines could boast covers by some distinguished American artists; The Popular Magazine had covers by N.C. Wyeth, and Edgar Franklin Wittmack contributed cover art to Argosy and Short Stories. Later, many artists specialized in creating covers mainly for the pulps; {{a number of the}} most successful cover artists became as popular as the authors featured on the interior pages. Among the most famous pulp artists were Walter Baumhofer, Earle K. Bergey, Margaret Brundage, Edd Cartier, Virgil Finlay, Frank R. Paul, Norman Saunders, Nick Eggenhofer, (who specialized in Western illustrations), Hugh J. Ward, George Rozen, and Rudolph Belarski. Covers were important enough to sales that sometimes they would be designed first; <b>authors</b> <b>would</b> then be shown the cover art and asked to write a story to match.|$|E
500|$|Subsequently, revisionist <b>authors</b> <b>would</b> {{formulate}} {{accusations against}} him, while promoting [...] Saavedra {{as a popular}} leader. According to those authors, Moreno was a British agent, a demagogic caudillo, a paranoid, a mere man of theoretical ideas applying European principles that failed in the local context, wrongly portrayed {{as leader of the}} Revolution by the liberal historiography. Año X by Hugo Wast is considered the harshest work against Moreno. Moreno was still considered an anglophile, but in a negative light. They blamed Moreno for the harsh policies of the Junta, considering him a terrorist or a predecessor of Marxism; liberal historians usually concealed these policies.|$|E
500|$|The first {{specimens}} of the Japanese sleeper ray known to science were four fish collected from Japan by German naturalists Philipp Franz von Siebold and Heinrich Burger {{during the second}} quarter of the 19th century. The specimens were stuffed and deposited at the National Museum of Natural History in Leiden; three of them were labeled as [...] "Narcine spec." [...] and one as [...] "Narcine timlei". This material formed the basis for a description authored by Coenraad Jacob Temminck and Hermann Schlegel, which was published in 1850 as part of Fauna Japonica, a series of monographs on Japanese zoology. Temminck and Schlegel assigned the new species to the subgenus Astrape of the genus Torpedo; later <b>authors</b> <b>would</b> synonymize Astrape with Narke. In 1947, Marinus Boeseman reexamined the four original specimens and designated the largest, [...] long, as the species lectotype. Other common names for this ray are Japanese electric ray and Japanese spotted torpedo. Some taxonomists believe that the sleeper torpedo (Crassinarke dormitor) may be conspecific with the Japanese sleeper ray, as their morphology is virtually identical.|$|E

500|$|City of Death {{is one of}} five Doctor Who serials {{from the}} series' {{original}} run (1963–1989) not to have been novelised by Target Books; the others are The Pirate Planet, Shada, Resurrection of the Daleks, and Revelation of the Daleks. Target approached Douglas Adams {{on a number of occasions}} with a view to commissioning a novelisation, offering their standard advance of £600; Adams replied saying, [...] "I don't want to be embarrassing but I do have a tendency to be a best-selling author". Target, concerned that their regular <b>authors</b> <b>would</b> seek better terms, refused to change their offer. Several years later, Target editor Nigel Robinson offered an advance of £4,000– double what was the standard advance at the time– but Adams again declined. Adams was unwilling to allow another author to write the novelisation. However, after Adams' death his estate allowed Gareth Roberts to write an adaptation of the unfinished serial Shada, which was published by BBC Books in 2012. In 2013, Roberts announced that he was working on a novelisation of City of Death, to be published on 21 May 2015. Roberts later announced that James Goss was working on the book instead.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the reign}} of David I, the Scots possessed a flourishing {{literary}} elite who regularly produced texts in both Gaelic and Latin that were frequently transmitted to Ireland and elsewhere. Dauvit Broun has shown that a Gaelic literary elite survived in the eastern Scottish lowlands, {{in places such as}} Loch Leven and Brechin into the thirteenth century, However, surviving records are predominantly written in Latin, and their <b>authors</b> <b>would</b> usually translate vernacular terms into Latin, so that historians are faced with researching a Gaelic society clothed in Latin terminology. Even names were translated into more common continental forms; for instance, Gilla Brigte became Gilbert, Áed became Hugh, etc. As far as written literature is concerned, there may be more medieval Scottish Gaelic literature than is often thought. Almost all medieval Gaelic literature has survived because it was sustained in Ireland, not in Scotland. Thomas Owen Clancy has recently all but proven that the Lebor Bretnach, the so-called [...] "Irish Nennius", was written in Scotland, and probably at the monastery in Abernethy. Yet this text survives only from manuscripts preserved in Ireland. Other literary work that has survived include that of the prolific poet Gille Brighde Albanach. About 1218, Gille Brighde wrote a poem — Heading for Damietta — on his experiences of the Fifth Crusade. In the thirteenth century, French flourished as a literary language, and produced the Roman de Fergus, one of the earliest pieces of non-Celtic vernacular literature to survive from Scotland.|$|E

2500|$|In 2015 a {{consortium}} of all of Netherlands' 14 universities threatened to boycott Elsevier if it could not agree that articles by Dutch <b>authors</b> <b>would</b> be made open access and settled with the compromise of 30% of its Dutch papers becoming open access by 2018.

2500|$|In modern printings of Ancient Greek, apostrophes {{are also}} used to mark elision. Some Ancient Greek words that end in short vowels elide when the next word starts with a vowel. For example, many Ancient Greek <b>authors</b> <b>would</b> write [...] (d’állos) for [...] (dè állos) and [...] (âr’ ou) for [...] (âra ou). Such modern usage should be {{carefully}} distinguished from polytonic Greek's native rough and smooth breathing marks, which usually appear {{as a form of}} rounded apostrophe.|$|E
