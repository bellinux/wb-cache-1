5|$|Further, {{the earth}} goddess Bhudevi {{falls in love}} with her rescuer Varaha. Vishnu - in his Varaha form - marries Bhudevi, making her one of the consorts of Vishnu. In one narrative, Vishnu and Bhudevi indulge in {{vigorous}} embraces and as a result, Bhudevi becomes fatigued and faints, sinking <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> the primordial ocean. Vishnu again acquires the form of Varaha and rescues her, reinstating her in her original position above the waters. Some scriptures state that Bhudevi gives birth to Varaha's son, an asura called Narakasura.|$|E
5|$|If {{the date}} and time of any solar eclipse are known, it is {{possible}} to predict other eclipses using eclipse cycles. The saros is probably the best known {{and one of the most}} accurate. A saros lasts 6,585.3 days (a little over 18 years), which means that, after this period, a practically identical eclipse will occur. The most notable difference will be a westward shift of about 120° in longitude (due to the 0.3 days) and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> latitude (north-south for odd-numbered cycles, the reverse for even-numbered ones). A saros series always starts with a partial eclipse near one of Earth's polar regions, then shifts over the globe through a series of annular or total eclipses, and ends with a partial eclipse at the opposite polar region. A saros series lasts 1226 to 1550 years and 69 to 87 eclipses, with about 40 to 60 of them being central.|$|E
5|$|Some {{forms of}} mimicry {{do not fit}} easily within the {{classification}} given above. Floral mimicry is induced by the discomycete fungus Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi. In this unusual case, a fungal plant pathogen infects leaves of blueberries, causing them to secrete sugars, in effect mimicking the nectar of flowers. To the naked eye the leaves do not look like flowers, yet they still attract pollinating insects like bees using an ultraviolet signal. This case is unusual, in that the fungus benefits from the deception {{but it is the}} leaves that act as mimics, being harmed in the process. It is similar to host-parasite mimicry, but the host does not receive the signal. It has <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> common with automimicry, but the plant does not benefit from the mimicry, and the action of the pathogen is required to produce it.|$|E

25|$|Of course these {{movements}} exercised tremendous {{pressure on the}} British Government and shook the government machinery. But the real importance, to my mind, lay in the effect they had on our own people, and especially the village masses....

They acted courageously and did not submit so easily to unjust oppression; their outlook widened and they began to think <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> terms of India as a whole....

25|$|The 1973 season saw Brain {{make his}} return to {{first-class}} duties, and he immediately delivered, taking 84 wickets at 19.29 that year, a career best tally {{that he was to}} equal (at an average only slightly higher) the following summer. Those two seasons also saw him pick up 58 one-day wickets, while in the Championship he took 6–36 against Gloucestershire in July 1973. His form dipped <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> 1975, but he still took more than 50 first-class wickets, including a career-best 8–55 against Essex in late May; that performance was in vain, however, as a second-innings Worcestershire collapse saw them lose by 29 runs.|$|E
25|$|Opposition to the {{decision}} not to re-employ Richards and Garner came loudest from Somerset's English-born star, the all-rounder Ian Botham, who refused a new contract for himself and joined Worcestershire. In the event, under Roebuck's captaincy and with Martin Crowe of New Zealand and Steve Waugh of Australia as overseas players, Somerset improved <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> 1987, though they remained among the weaker counties for a further six seasons. After many years of bitterness and the eventual removal of Roebuck from the club, Richards was honoured with the naming of a set of entrance gates and a stand after him at the County Ground, Taunton.|$|E

Heywood's hopes that his former shipmate would verify his innocence were quickly dashed. Hayward, [...] "...like all worldlings raised <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> life, received us very coolly, and pretended ignorance of our affairs." [...] Pandora remained at Tahiti for five weeks while Captain Edwards tried without success to obtain information on Bounty's whereabouts. A cell was built on Pandora's quarterdeck, a structure known as [...] "Pandora's Box" [...] where the prisoners, legs in irons and wrists in handcuffs, were to be confined for almost five months. Heywood wrote: [...] "The heat ... was so intense that the sweat frequently ran in streams to the scuppers, and produced maggots {{in a short time}} ... and the two necessary tubs which were constantly kept in place helped to render our situation truly disagreeable." ...|$|E

[...] He spent some time {{looking for a new}} publisher—editor Roy Torgeson was one of those interested—but on September 15, 1978, he sold his half of the business to Arthur Bernhard, his partner. [...] White renewed his suggestions for improving the format of the magazine: he wanted to make Fantastic the same size as Time, and believed he could avoid the mistakes that had been made by other sf magazines that had tried that approach. [...] White also proposed an increase in the budget and asked for a raise. [...] Bernhard not only turned down White's ideas, but also stopped paying him: White responded by resigning. [...] His last official day as editor was November 9; the last issue of Fantastic under his control was the January 1979 issue. [...] He returned all submissions to their authors, saying that he had been told to do so by Bernhard; Bernhard denied this.|$|E
500|$|On his {{reliance}} on PayPal donations, Adams {{says he is}} content since he feels that people really like his work or they would not pay. Adams said that donations remain stable except during a new version update, {{where there is a}} sudden increase. Their expenses being low, he has maintained that he is happy as long as the game is self-sustaining and will not charge for it. In 2011, Adams refused a job offer from an unspecified major game developer and a $300,000 deal to license the name Dwarf Fortress from another company. Adams felt that this amount would not equate to long-term donations and that he prefers working on his own—not being part of the gaming industry. Adams said, [...] "Barely in the black one month, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> the red another month. ... It's a risk I'm willing to take, and really I couldn't have it any other way." [...] He has spent no money on advertising and was happy when bloggers, reviewers like former game journalist Kieron Gillen from PC Gamer and Games for Windows, wrote about his game. In 2015, Bay 12 Games set up a Patreon account to help fund it.|$|E
