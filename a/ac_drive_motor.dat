40|$|AC motors {{have been}} used {{in a wide range of}} power ratings to date and are playing a {{prominent}} role in drive applications. However, their highly non-linear dynamic structure with strong dynamic interactions requires more complex control schemes than dc motors. [...] The conventional linear techniques can no longer satisfy the stringent requirement placed on high-performance <b>ac</b> <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> applications. Modern control techniques, such as optimal control and adaptive control, are applied in <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> systems. But the realization of these techniques is generally difficult because of large time-critical computation requirements. Typical field-oriented control of ac motors uses current loop sampling rates of 5 to 10 KHz. This implies that the controller must process the control algorithms within 100 to 200 μs. Thus, for high-performance <b>ac</b> <b>drives,</b> some powerful microcomputers, such as Transputers, and parallel processing techniques are used in <b>ac</b> <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> systems. On the other hand, reducing the energy losses in adjustable-speed electric <b>motor</b> <b>drives</b> is becoming increasingly important due to the high cost of energy. [...] Transputer-based parallel processing of high performance <b>ac</b> <b>motor</b> <b>drives</b> can be a good solution for fast dynamic calculation, flexible architecture and interactive control in order to achieve both requirements of high performance and loss minimization of <b>ac</b> <b>motor</b> <b>drives.</b> [...] The purpose of this study is to investigate and apply multiple Transputers in parallel processing of indirect field-oriented vector control employing loss minimization for high performance <b>ac</b> <b>motor</b> <b>drives.</b> A new scheme is proposed based on the use of multiple Transputers for real-time parallel processing implementation of the indirect field-oriented control scheme incorporating the loss minimization strategy. Losses in <b>ac</b> <b>motor</b> <b>drives</b> are studied and verified by experiments. Computer simulation results of trials using five Transputers and experimental results of using four Transputers for parallel processing are presented in the thesis.
