5|$|Opponents of the FairTax {{argue that}} {{imposing}} a national retail sales tax would drive transactions underground {{and create a}} vast underground economy. Under a retail sales tax system, the purchase of intermediate goods and services that are factors of production are not taxed, since those goods would produce a final retail good that would be taxed. Individuals and businesses {{may be able to}} manipulate the tax system by claiming that purchases are for intermediate goods, when in fact they are final purchases that should be taxed. Proponents point out that a business is required to have a registered seller's certificate on file, and must keep complete records of all transactions for six years. Businesses must also record all taxable goods bought for seven years. They are required to report these sales every month (see Personal vs. business purchases). The government could also stipulate that all retail sellers provide buyers with a written receipt, regardless of transaction type (cash, credit, etc.), which would create <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>trail</b> for evasion with risk of having the buyer turn them in (the FairTax authorizes a reward for reporting tax cheats).|$|E
500|$|In late 1940 the Allies {{recovered}} {{the journal of}} an Italian officer during an operation at Sidi Barrani. The diary referred to fears of British paratroopers being landed to the Italian rear. At the time the Allies had no airborne troops in the North African region. Dudley Clarke, in charge of military deception in the region, decided to play on these fears by creating a fictional airborne unit. Clarke began Operation Abeam in January 1941 by creating <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>trail</b> for the 1st SAS Brigade. The fictional unit was supposedly training for special missions in Transjordan. Clarke established their existence using documentary and physical subterfuge. Photographs of parachutists were printed in local papers, documents were planted with the enemy, Allied airmen were warned {{to look out for}} gliders (Victor Jones mocked up some dummies to support the story), and a section of desert was cordoned off for [...] "training". To aid the rumours, two soldiers were dressed in 1st SAS uniforms and wandered around the Allied-held cities of Cairo, Port Said, and Alexandria, where they were briefed to hint at missions in Crete or Libya.|$|E

2500|$|Also in 1982, {{there were}} rumors about Butcher's banking practices. Knoxville federal and state bank {{investigators}} had long suspected that Butcher was engaged in unlawful banking practices. On November 1, 1982, 180 federal bank regulators from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation simultaneously raided all of the Butcher brothers' 29 bank branches and offices, thereby preventing transfers of funds to cover their tracks. Bank records ultimately led investigators on <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> <b>trail</b> of illegal loans, forged documents and various other forms of fraud. The United American Bank collapsed on 14 February 1983. It was the fourth-largest bank failure in US history up to that time. Seven other Butcher-controlled banks and the Southern Industrial Banking Corporation, a state licensed loan and thrift company run by C.H. Butcher, also became insolvent {{during the rest of}} 1983, and an additional three banks in 1984. The FDIC estimated that its losses in connection with the failed Butcher brother banks would total approximately $382.6 million. [...] Later that year, it was learned that Butcher was also insolvent; his assets were listed at $11.9 million and his liabilities at $32.5 million.|$|E

Can you get this stopped and let me know why this is happening? I will need to send a response back to Apple quickly so please let me know as soon as you can. Thanks Eric". Schmidt's email led to a recruiter for Google being [...] "terminated within the hour" [...] for not having adhered to the illegal scheme. Under Schmidt, there was a [...] "Do Not Call list" [...] of companies Google would avoid recruiting from. According to a court filing, another email exchange shows Google's human resources director asking Schmidt about sharing its no-cold call agreements with competitors.

40|$|Abstract In this <b>paper</b> <b>a</b> pilot e-voting {{system is}} being studied to {{gain insight into}} the {{complexity}} of IT security issues. The current debate {{about whether or not}} electronic voting systems need to have <b>a</b> verifiable <b>paper</b> audit <b>trail</b> provides the context of the paper. According to many researchers <b>a</b> voter-verified <b>paper</b> <b>trail</b> is the only way voters can have confidence that their vote has been recorded correctly. However, technologists start to acknowledge that security mechanisms are fundamental social mechanisms. Trust is of great importance; people no longer have a blind faith in scientific objectivity and the “experts”. We examine the opinions of users involved in the testing of the TruE-Vote e-voting system, in particular concerning issues like security, verifiability and trust. The results do indeed suggest that IT security {{is more than just a}} technological issue. 1...|$|R
