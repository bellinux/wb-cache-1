5|$|Heydrich was, for <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes, {{military}} dictator of Bohemia and Moravia. His {{changes to}} the government's structure left President Emil Hacha and his cabinet virtually powerless. He often drove alone {{in a car with}} an open roof—a show of his confidence in the occupation forces and in his government's effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, the Portuguese {{presence}} on the Angolan coast remained limited {{for much of the}} colonial period. The degree of real colonial settlement was minor, and, with few exceptions, the Portuguese did not interfere by means other than commercial in the social and political dynamics of the native peoples. There was no real delimitation of territory; Angola, to <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes, did not yet exist.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Zrínyi saw {{action in}} the Adriatic Sea. She served with the Second Division of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's battleships and shelled Senigallia {{as part of the}} {{bombardment}} of the key seaport of Ancona, Italy, during May 1915. However, Allied control of the Strait of Otranto meant that the Austro-Hungarian Navy was, for <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes, effectively bottled up in the Adriatic. Nonetheless, the presence of the Zrínyi and other battleships tied down a substantial force of Allied ships.|$|E

60|$|Almah. Heaven knows, from <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> of ill 'twas free, Yet it may feed my husband's jealousy; And {{for that}} cause I {{wish it were}} not done.|$|R
60|$|On the cushions, richly {{embroidered}} in dainty Eastern colouring, lay Mabel de Hundberg, {{with dry}} lips half opened and panting, too weary to move, yet listening <b>all</b> <b>intent.</b>|$|R
5|$|Having been {{ratified}} by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several states (27 of the 36 states, including those {{that had been in}} rebellion), Secretary of State Seward, on December 18, 1865, certified that the Thirteenth Amendment had become valid, to <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes, {{as a part of the}} Constitution. Included on the enrolled list of ratifying states were the three ex-Confederate states that had given their assent, but with strings attached. Seward accepted their affirmative votes and brushed aside their interpretive declarations without comment, challenge or acknowledgment.|$|E
5|$|Timmy {{prepares to}} gun down Langly and Frohike, but is {{injected}} with the mind control drug by Byers. As it {{takes hold of}} him and he collapses, and the Lone Gunmen successfully mind-control him into turning himself in. Byers explains to Susanne Modeski that, for <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes, she is deceased and {{that she has a}} new identity. She asks Byers to go with her to start a new life, but he explains he has to keep up the fight. She kisses him goodbye and hands over a wedding ring meant for Grant Ellis.|$|E
5|$|With the Ordos now {{adequately}} fortified, the Mongols avoided {{its walls}} by riding east to invade Datong and Xuanfu (宣府; present-day Xuanhua, Hebei Province), which were two major garrisons guarding {{the corridor to}} Beijing where no walls had been built. The two defence lines of Xuanfu and Datong left by the Northern Qi and the early Ming had deteriorated by this point, and for <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes the inner line was the capital's main line of defence.|$|E
60|$|A {{few feet}} from the {{children}} Cole stopped. They were <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> and absorbed by the box on Steven's knees. Suddenly a hush fell over the children. Earl looked up slowly.|$|R
60|$|But I was <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> {{upon that}} lout, who stood there before me {{shifting}} uneasily upon his feet, his air mutinous and sullen. Over his shoulder I had {{a glimpse of}} his father's yellow face, wide-eyed with alarm.|$|R
60|$|Andre-Louis had {{remained}} {{standing at the}} tail of the travelling house. He was still passing the comb through his straggling hair, but mechanically and unconsciously. His mind was <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> upon the advancing troop, his wits alert and gathered together for a leap in whatever direction should be indicated.|$|R
5|$|Although {{formally}} {{separate from}} Greek Orthodox and Latin (Catholic) Christians, the Armenians consider their quarter {{to be part}} of the Christian Quarter. The three Christian patriarchates of Jerusalem and the government of Armenia have publicly expressed their opposition to any political division of the two quarters. The central reasons for the existence of a separate Armenian Quarter is the miaphysitism and distinct language and culture of the Armenians, who, unlike the majority of Christians in Jerusalem (also in Israel and Palestine), are neither Arab nor Palestinian. However, for <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes, the Armenians living in the Armenian Quarter are considered Palestinians by Israel and the United Nations (UN). They have faced many of the same restrictions on their lives as have the Palestinians.|$|E
5|$|Resolved {{and ordered}} by this Board—That the old seal of this corporation, {{now in the}} hands of the Mayor, be changed and altered, and that there be a new seal in its place, which new seal, being now {{produced}} to this board and approved of by them, the same is ordered to be lodged in the hands of our present clerk in his office for the use and behoof of this corporation, and that the present now new seal be henceforth our seal and called, deemed and esteemed the common seal of this corporation until it be altered and changed and the aforesaid former seal be null and void and dead in law to <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|The dam was completed, and Beaver Lake was at {{full height}} by June 1966. For <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes, Harvey's Monte Ne was gone. However, {{in times of}} drought, some of the {{structures}} become visible again. The lake dropped to its lowest level on January 22, 1977, more than 27feet (8m) below its average depth, and the amphitheater and bridges were visible {{for the first time}} in more than 10 years. Before the water flooded downtown Monte Ne again, the rest of the buildings were either bulldozed or moved to avoid problems for swimmers, boaters, and fishermen. The few bridges that spanned the lagoon and the amphitheater were not demolished.|$|E
60|$|Several of the Quakers were {{standing}} {{out from the}} bench, <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> on the Rube. He had stirred them up. First it was humor; then ridicule, curiosity, suspicion, doubt. And I knew it would grow to wonder and certainty, then fierce attack from both tongues and bats, and lastly--for ball players are generous--unstinted admiration.|$|R
60|$|The {{sight that}} met Hal's {{eyes as he}} opened the door filled the youth with wonder. He had often heard of such places, but he had never dreamed of them being as they are. He saw a long hall, brilliantly lighted. Crowded about the table, some {{standing}} and some sitting, were young men and old, <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> on the games that were going on.|$|R
50|$|From the 1970s, {{his works}} have been {{inspired}} by the development of the consumer society with the effects of industrialization, pollution, road traffic and entertainment centres as, for example, in his 1977 painting Københavns Vinterbane (Copenhagen's Winter Track) based on an annual cycling event in Copenhagen. However, there is less emphasis on the cycling than on the people attending the event who are <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> on making a quick fortune.|$|R
5|$|As the French {{constructed}} further fortifications, Luftwaffe {{reconnaissance aircraft}} {{picked up the}} activity and reported it. The steep slopes {{on the banks of}} the Meuse, added to what appeared in photographic reconnaissance to be a formidable barrier of bunkers and defence lines, caused Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, the commander in chief of Army Group A, to question the wisdom of Guderian in choosing Sedan as the point of maximum effort. To identify how strong these fortifications were, a team of photographic specialists were called in to evaluate the pictures. Their analysis concluded that what appeared to be strong fortified positions were just the construction sites of half-built bunkers that were, to <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes, empty shells. The contribution of the specialists tilted the Sedan attack plan into Guderian's favour.|$|E
5|$|Production of {{components}} would be split between Breguet and BAC, and the aircraft themselves would be assembled on two production lines; {{one in the}} UK and one in France, To avoid any duplication of work, each aircraft component had only one source. The British light strike/tactical support versions were the most demanding design, requiring supersonic performance, superior avionics, a cutting edge nav/attack system of more accuracy and complexity than the French version, moving map display, laser range-finder and marked-target seeker (LRMTS). As a result, the initial Br.121 design needed a thinner wing, redesigned fuselage, a higher rear cockpit, and after-burning engines. While putting on smiling faces for the public, maintaining {{the illusion of a}} shared design, the British design de facto departed from the French sub-sonic Breguet 121 {{to such a degree that}} it was for <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes a new design.|$|E
5|$|Theodore's brother Manuel, {{who managed}} to escape from Klokotnitsa, now took over the throne in Thessalonica. His domain was reduced to the environs {{of the city and}} his family's core territories in Epirus and Thessaly, as well as Dyrrhachium and Corfu, while his brother Constantine in Aetolia and Acarnania {{recognized}} his suzerainty. As a son-in-law of John Asen, Manuel was allowed to maintain internal autonomy, but to <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes he was a client of the Bulgarian Tsar. At about the same time, Michael I's bastard son Michael II returned from exile and quickly succeeded, apparently {{with the support of the}} local population, in taking over control of Epirus. Manuel was forced to recognize the fait accompli under the pretense that Michael recognized his suzerainty, in token of which Manuel conferred him the title of Despot. In reality Michael was fully independent, and very quickly ceased to acknowledge Manuel's suzerainty; by 1236, he had seized Corfu. In order to preserve some freedom of manoeuvre and counter Asen's attempts to subordinate the Epirote Church to the Bulgarian Church of Tarnovo, Manuel turned to his brother's erstwhile rivals in Nicaea and brought an end to the ecclesiastical schism by acknowledging the legitimacy and superiority of the Nicaea-based Patriarch.|$|E
60|$|But the old gentleman {{had moved}} {{off into the}} path, or {{perhaps it would be}} more {{accurate}} {{to say that he was}} carried off by the swarm which clustered around him, two smaller ones tugging at his hand, and <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> upon arriving at the soda-water pavilion near the entrance. They had followed him with their eyes, and they saw him turn around and smile at them, helplessly. Alison presented a perplexed face to Hodder.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the next}} few hours a fierce {{exchange}} of fire took place. In the process John Wahl moved in and rescued Gert Botha. Bok Kriel also moved in and rescues Jaco Kotze. Again John Wahl moved in and rescued Giel Visser. This he did without his gunner as to make space for Giel and for <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> and purposes were thus unarmed.Taljaard was killed and Bok Kriel got wounded for the second time, in his neck.|$|R
60|$|Castle Richmond, too, {{would have}} been a dull house, as Lady Fitzgerald had intimated, had it not been that there was a common subject of such vital {{interest}} to the whole party. On that subject they were <b>all</b> <b>intent,</b> and on that subject they talked the whole evening, planning, preparing, and laying out schemes; devising how their money might be made to go furthest; discussing deep questions of political economy, and making, no doubt, many errors in their discussions.|$|R
25|$|Blackfoot syllabics have, for <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes, disappeared. Present day Blackfoot {{speakers}} use a Latin alphabet, {{and very}} few Blackfoot can still read—much less write—the syllabic system.|$|E
25|$|With its two-scene prologue and three-act structure, Siegfried's Tod was to <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and {{purposes}} a draft text {{for what would}} eventually be the final part of the tetralogy, Götterdämmerung (The Twilight of the Gods).|$|E
25|$|The Slaver stasis field, {{which causes}} {{time in the}} {{enclosed}} volume to stand still; since time has for <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes ceased for an object in stasis, no harm can come to anything within the field.|$|E
60|$|He {{heard her}} gasp of astonishment when she {{realized}} the ingenuity and boldness of his plan; then he directed her to adjust the other pair of wings and the robe upon him. Working with strong, deft fingers she soon had the work completed, and the two stepped out upon the roof, to <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> and purpose genuine Wieroos. Besides his pistol Bradley carried the sword of the slain Wieroo prophet, while the girl was armed with the small blade of the red Wieroo.|$|R
60|$|The {{citizens}} {{were dressed in}} flowing garments of white, and <b>all</b> seemed <b>intent</b> on worship which was prolonged until after the spectators left the tree.|$|R
50|$|Nirit {{was founded}} on January 19, 1982 and was named after an {{indigenous}} plant, Ridolfia segetum, growing nearby. It expanded twice, once in 1986-1988 and again in 2000. Until 1986 there were only 15 families in temporary buildings, and nowadays it grew to about 240 families. In 2005 a new neighborhood named Nof Hasharon was built adjacent to Nirit. This neighborhood is located just outside the Green Line, actually belongs to the settlement Alfei Menashe, but in reality merged with Nirit for <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> and purpose.|$|R
25|$|For example, MCC was {{authorised}} {{to determine}} the status of matches played in Great Britain. For <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes, the 1947 ICC definition confirmed the 1894 MCC definition and gave it international recognition and usage.|$|E
25|$|Whether {{it was the}} public's {{resistance}} to disco, {{or the lack of}} Dread's popular frontman, Tortelvis, sales of It's Not Unusual were disappointing. The band was dropped by IRS and for <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes, had broken up.|$|E
25|$|The Presidium {{exercises}} {{legislative power}} when the SPA is in recess, which occurs during {{all but a}} few days of every year. For <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes, it is the highest organ of state power in North Korea.|$|E
60|$|Vivian Grey was {{now about}} to join, {{for the second}} time, the great and {{agitated}} crowd of beings who are <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> in the search after that undiscoverable talisman, Happiness. That he entertained any hope of being the successful inquirer {{is not to be}} imagined. He considered that the happiest moment in human life is exactly the sensation of a sailor who has escaped a shipwreck, and that the mere belief that his wishes are to be indulged is the greatest bliss enjoyed by man.|$|R
50|$|CJZN {{signed on}} {{for the first time}} on January 18, 1950 as CKDA, {{initially}} broadcasting on 1340 AM at 250 watts under the ownership of Capital Broadcasting System Ltd. (headed by founder David Armstrong). On August 1, 1954, CKDA moved to 1280 AM and increased its power to 5000 watts; in 1955, CKDA-FM was signed on as a simulcast of CKDA-AM, and was for <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> the studio transmitter link to the off-shore transmitter site. On September 18, 1957, the AM station moved to 1220 kHz and doubled its power to 10,000 watts.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the decline}} of the Mughal power, the region of Deccan saw the rise of Maratha Empire. The Nizam himself saw many invasions by the Marathas in the 1720s, which {{resulted}} in the Nizam paying a regular tax (Chauth) to the Marathas. The major battles fought between the Marathas and the Nizam include Palkhed, Bhopal, Rakshasbhuvan, and Kharda, in all of which the Nizam lost. Following the conquest of Deccan by Bajirao I and the imposition of chauth by him, Nizam remained a tributary of the Marathas for <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> and purposes.|$|R
