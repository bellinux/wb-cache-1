People responded really well to it. It's been interesting for me, since the events of September11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and really even talking to me about 'Never Too Far', 'cause that song is also about loss. I figured that it would be a nice thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment. The proceeds from 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero' and 'There for Me' <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the Heroes Fund, and it's going to benefit police officers' families, relief workers' families.|$|E
500|$|Lori Loughlin {{auditioned for}} the role of Debbie and was given the part {{straight}} away. Sachs thought that Loughlin was too established to read for the part, but realized that she understood the role immediately. The producers were fans of Jessica Walter after watching her film, Play Misty for Me. Sachs found that Walter knew pieces of scenes, and suggested [...] "stuff that works". Sachs described Ryan Eggold, who portrayed Matthews, as [...] "a sophisticated actor, and he's also very funny". Sachs believed that every time Eggold would be on screen, [...] "people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> 'Wow!'".|$|E

They've undermined the credibility and confidence that people have, for example in science, dealing with climate." [...] He also spoke about the importance of evidence-based decision making. In her speech, Bonamici said science should not be a partisan issue, and told the crowd: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to Washington, D.C., with all of you in our mind [...] this beautiful sea of science supporters, and fight for research, fight for science, fight for clean air, fight for clean water, and fight for our planet.

500|$|Barrett, {{along with}} Pink Floyd's managers, Peter Jenner and King, wanted {{to release the}} song as a single in the new year, before being vetoed by both the band and Norman Smith. Jenner said that [...] "Jugband Blues", along with two others that Syd wrote around this time, ("Scream Thy Last Scream" [...] and [...] "Vegetable Man") were [...] "amazing songs." [...] When {{compared}} to [...] "Bike" [...] and [...] "The Scarecrow", Jenner said [...] "You think, 'Well, OK, those are all right, but these are powerful disturbing art.' I wouldn't want anyone {{to have to go}} as mad and disturbed as Syd did to get that, but if you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> that disturbed give me something like that.

500|$|Stacy Brooks, then-president of the Lisa McPherson Trust, stated: [...] "There's no {{way that}} this movie would be {{happening}} without Scientology's backing… This {{is one example of}} how Scientology insinuates itself in various aspects of the culture." [...] Mark Bunker characterized the film as a recruitment tactic for the Church of Scientology, stating, [...] "It's designed to introduce L. Ron Hubbard to a whole new generation of kids. It's there to plant a favorable seed in children's minds." [...] Bunker criticized the promotional methods of the film—instead of granting interviews about the film to the press, John Travolta went on a book tour and signed copies of L. Ron Hubbard's novel. Bunker stated, [...] "When Michael Caine goes around to promote The Cider House Rules, he doesn't tour bookstores and sign copies of John Irving's novel… Through the movie tie-in with the book, kids will send in the card to get their free poster, and eventually be introduced to Dianetics." [...] Scientologist Nancy O'Meara, at the time treasurer of the Foundation for Religious Freedom and currently treasurer of the Scientology-run New Cult Awareness Network, responded to Bunker's statement: [...] "Gimme a break… That's like saying people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> see Gladiator and then suddenly find themselves wanting to explore Christianity." ...|$|E

500|$|Pinto's {{first film}} of 2015 was Terrence Malick's Knight of Cups, an {{experimental}} film that featured an ensemble cast including Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Natalie Portman, and Antonio Banderas. She played Helen, a model with whom Bale embarks on a [...] "dalliance". She talked about acting without a script: [...] "It {{is definitely a}} bit nerve-racking {{on the first day}} because you don't know where you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> But once you figure that out, then it doesn't really matter. It is actually very relaxing. It is fun and liberating. It is an experience that I completely embrace". Premiering at the competition section of the 65th Berlin International Film Festival, the film received average to mixed reviews from critics. The film was released in the United States in March 2016. She was among the 100 narrators of Unity (2015), a documentary that explores the relationships between Earth's species. Her third release of that year was the Colombian action film Blunt Force Trauma, in which she starred opposite Ryan Kwanten and Mickey Rourke as a woman looking for her brother's murderer. John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter criticised the film, stating that it [...] "takes itself much more seriously than viewers will." [...] In 2015, Pinto worked on Andy Serkis' Jungle Book, a motion capture adventure fantasy film based on Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book. She will portray Mowgli's adoptive mother in the film.|$|E
500|$|Avatar {{has been}} called [...] "without a doubt the most epic piece of {{environmental}} advocacy ever captured on celluloid.... The film hits all the important environmental talking-points—virgin rain forests threatened by wanton exploitation, indigenous peoples who have much to teach the developed world, a planet which functions as a collective, interconnected Gaia-istic organism, and evil corporate interests {{that are trying to}} destroy it all." [...] Cameron has spoken extensively with the media about the film's environmental message, saying that he envisioned Avatar as a broader metaphor of how we treat the natural world. [...] He said that he created Pandora as [...] "a fictionalised fantasy version of what our world was like, before we started to pave it and build malls, and shopping centers. [...] So it's really an evocation of the world we used to have." [...] He told Charlie Rose that [...] "we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through a lot of pain and heartache if we don't acknowledge our stewardship responsibilities to nature." [...] Interviewed by Terry Gross of National Public Radio, he called Avatar a satire on the sense of human entitlement: [...] " [...] is saying our attitude about indigenous people and our entitlement about what is rightfully theirs is the same sense of entitlement that lets us bulldoze a forest and not blink an eye. It's just human nature that if we can take it, we will. And sometimes we do it in a very naked and imperialistic way, and other times we do it in a very sophisticated way with lots of rationalization—but it's basically the same thing. A sense of entitlement. And we can't just go on in this unsustainable way, just taking what we want and not giving back." [...] An article in the Belgium paper De Standaard agreed: [...] "It's about the brutality of man, who shamelessly takes what isn't his." ...|$|E
500|$|On the April 13, 2017 {{edition of}} The Juggalo Show with Jumpsteady, Violent J, and Kevin Gill, {{it was said}} by Violent J that {{recently}} he has pushed his solo album Karma Forest back because he has [...] "been consumed with the entity that is the next Joker Card" [...] also saying [...] "I am finding out more about it everyday {{and it may be}} the best entity in the Dark Carnival yet". He stated [...] "The only thing that I can say about it is Red Fred, Red Fred". He also said the future plans as of now are, they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on The Parental Advisory Tour with 2 Live Crew, Onyx, Geto Boys and they were trying to also get Necro throughout the month of June leading up to the Gathering of the Juggalos. Then after the GOTJ, Shaggy 2 Dope will embark on the F.T.F.O.M.F. Tour to promote his third solo album F.T.F.O.M.F. While Shaggy 2 Dope is on tour Violent J is going to form the skeleton of the next Joker Card, and when Shaggy 2 Dope gets back from tour, then they will start putting the [...] "nerves, muscle, tissue, skin etc. together and then bring the entity to life". He also stated that ICP will also go on a 20th Anniversary: The Great Milenko Tour, after the Juggalo March On Washington (September 16 – 17, 2017) which will lead up to their 24th Annual Hallowicked Show, and then they will tour England mid to late November (13–20). In late April/early May Necro announced that he will not take part in the Juggalo March On Washington nor would he take part in The Parental Advisory Tour stating in part [...] "It's all good between us, just business. They were wanting me to tour for a month basically for free". On May 26, 2017 when F.T.F.O.M.F. was released, the song [...] "Foggin' Up The Window" [...] caught a lot of [...] "Juggalo Theorists" [...] attention because of Violent J's verse saying [...] "Now my number 4 is all red, Red Fred, Red Fred", believing that to be the name of the next Joker Card, or possibly it's what is said to [...] "summon" [...] the entity, going back to the April 13, 2017 edition of The Juggalo Show. [...] "Fearless Fred Fury" [...] was revealed as the name of the next Joker Card at their Hallowicked show.|$|E

2500|$|Bahraini {{human rights}} groups and {{opposition}} parties have heavily criticized recruiting mercenaries in the Bahraini security forces.

And those are maybe responsible {{for a lot of}} killing and a lot of systematic torture and human rights violations committed in the past months and years". Michael Stephens, of the Royal United Services Institute linked recruiting mercenaries in the Bahraini security forces to the lack of government confidence in its own citizens. [...] "So they rely on foreign recruits to unquestioningly carry out orders of violently suppressing protests", he said.

Rob Estes, the last actor to join the series, was a previous cast member of the first Beverly Hills, 90210 spin-off, Melrose Place. Estes was sought by The CW to play Harry, but was contracted on the drama Women's Murder Club. When that series was cancelled, Sachs called Estes and explained the spin-off to him, and {{he thought it was a}} great idea.
