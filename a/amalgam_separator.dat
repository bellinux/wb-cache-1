50|$|The 50-year anniversary {{was celebrated}} in 1991 {{with a grand}} {{ceremony}} under the viaduct in Bietigheim Bietigheim Viaduct. The combination suction unit VSA 300 {{was introduced in the}} year of 1993; a combination of suction machine, separation unit and <b>amalgam</b> <b>separator</b> for the first time. In 1995, the VistaCam dental video system was introduced for expanding the diagnostic possibilities. The VistaRay X-ray sensors were introduced in 1997. In the year 1999, the Vector was introduced for the therapy and prophylaxis of parodontopathies.|$|E
25|$|Environmental {{concerns}} over external costs exist as well. In the United States, dental amalgam {{is the largest}} source of mercury received by sewage treatment plants. The mercury contaminates the treatment plant sludge, which is typically disposed of by land application, landfilling or incineration. Several states, including New Jersey, New York, and Michigan, have required the installation of dental <b>amalgam</b> <b>separators</b> prior to 2017. EPA promulgated an effluent guidelines regulation in 2017 which prohibits most dental practices from disposing amalgam waste down the drain. Most dental offices nationwide are now required to use <b>amalgam</b> <b>separators.</b>|$|R
50|$|The European Commission {{has issued}} a Waste Directive that classifies amalgam waste as a {{hazardous}} waste. The waste should be separated from other waste by fitting <b>amalgam</b> <b>separators</b> in all dental practices.|$|R
25|$|The WHO {{reported}} in 2005 {{that in the}} United Kingdom mercury from amalgam accounted for 5% of total mercury emissions. In Canada, dental amalgam was estimated to contribute one-third of the mercury in sewer system waste, but it is believed <b>amalgam</b> <b>separators</b> in dental offices may dramatically decrease this burden on the public sewer system.|$|R
40|$|Mercury is {{the only}} metal that is in liquid form at room {{temperature}} and it has over the years been used in various combinations to extract gold, in measuring devices, medicaments, paper industry, batteries and fluorescent lights {{as well as in}} dentistry as dental amalgam. Dental amalgam is a mixture of 50 % mercury and 50 % of an alloy consisting of silver, tin, copper and zink particles and has been used in dentistry for many years. The environmental effect of mercury release into the sewer from dental practices and clinics, and the inability of the wastewater treatment plants to remove it from the sludge lead to the introduction of amalgam separators in Sweden in 1980. The ISO standard 11143 regulates the efficacy of the amalgam separators, which should be at a 95 % level, but is based on a laboratory test rather than a clinical evaluation. This study looks at the available amalgam separators in use in four areas of Sweden, Uppsala, Stockholm, Östergötland and Skåne and compares their clinical efficiency. The clinical efficiency ranged between 75 to 95 %, with most units below the 90 % mark. In Östergötland a new improved separator is being tried, the Capere unit, which is based on finely ground pine bark treated with a chelator sensitive to all metals and used in conjunction with a cotton filter and a regular <b>amalgam</b> <b>separator.</b> This was shown to be superior to the other separators, with a 99, 9 % removal of even the smallest amalgam particles and ionic mercury from the wastewater before leaving the clinic. Otherwise, combining more than one <b>amalgam</b> <b>separator</b> of the brands available on the Swedish market did not improve the efficiency of them...|$|E
40|$|Amalgam use {{and waste}} {{management}} by Pakistani dentists: an environmental perspective R. Mumtaz, 1 A. Ali Khan, 1 N. Noor 2 and S. Humayun 3 ABSTRACT To assess amalgam use and waste management protocols practised by Pakistani dentists, a cross-sectional study {{was made of}} 239 dentists in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, recruited by convenience and cluster sampling. Amalgam was {{the most frequently used}} restorative material, with the choice dictated by patients’ financial constraints. While 90. 4 % of dentists perceived amalgam as a health risk, only 46. 4 % considered it an environmental hazard. The majority disposed of amalgam waste in the trash, down the sink or as hospital waste. Very few (5. 9 %) had an <b>amalgam</b> <b>separator</b> installed in their dental office. Amalgam waste management protocols and mercury recycling should be introduced in Pakistan...|$|E
40|$|This Verification Test Plan (VTP) {{describes}} the procedures {{that will be}} used to test the mercury and mercury amalgam removal performance of the Dental Recycling North America, Inc. (DRNA) Mercury Removal Unit (MRU) when used in a general dentistry practice. DRNA sells a MRU unit that is designed to remove particulate and soluble mercury that is present in the discharge from dental office vacuum systems. The MRU includes a mercury <b>amalgam</b> <b>separator</b> unit that is based on sedimentation theory for removal of particulate and an adsorbent system that removes soluble mercury by adsorption onto a solid media. An initial characterization test to determine the mercury levels in untreated wastewater from the vacuum system will be performed by collecting 25 samples representing 25 days of operation at the dental office. The verification test period will include the collection of 25 samples collected over 25 days of operation and will include analysis of the treated water for settleable, soluble and insoluble mercury. Residuals from the separator unit, the particle filter, and adsorbent filter will be collected and analyzed {{at the end of the}} verification test...|$|E
2500|$|The 2005 WHO report {{stated that}} mercury from amalgam was {{approximately}} 1% of total global mercury emissions, and that {{one-third of the}} total mercury in most sewage systems was discharged from dental offices. Other studies have shown {{this to be a}} gross exaggeration or not reflective of developed countries. With respect to pollution in the United States, a study done in 1992 showed that batteries [...] "accounted for 86 percent of discarded mercury and dental amalgam a mere 0.56 percent". Mercury is an environmental contaminant and the WHO, OSHA, and NIOSH have established specific occupational exposure limits. Mercury imposes health risks upon the surrounding population. In economics, this pollution is considered an external cost not factored into the private costs of using mercury-based products. Environmental risks from amalgam can be mitigated by <b>amalgam</b> <b>separators</b> and the ISO has issued standards regarding the proper handling and disposal of amalgam waste. It should be noted, however, that mercury is a naturally occurring element that is present throughout the environment {{and the vast majority of}} the pollution (about 99%) comes from large-scale human industrial activity (such as coal-fired electricity generation, hydroelectric dams, and mining, which increase both airborne and waterborne mercury levels). Eventually, the airborne mercury finds its way into lakes, rivers, and oceans, where it is consumed by aquatic life. <b>Amalgam</b> <b>separators</b> may dramatically decrease the release of mercury into the public sewer system, but they are not mandatory in some jurisdictions. When mercury from these sources enters bodies of water, especially acidic bodies of water, it can be converted into the more toxic methylmercury.|$|R
50|$|In 1981, the {{founding}} of Dürr GmbH & Co. KG - Luft- und Processor-Technik caused the company to diversify into new business areas. The main focus was on pumps and compressors for special industrial applications. 1982 saw the company moving to today's company headquarters in Bietigheim-Bissingen, Höpfigheimer Straße 17. The company's own electronics production with {{printed circuit board assembly}} in Gechingen was realised from 1983. The Dürr system hygiene for disinfection and cleaning in surgeries and laboratories was introduced in 1986. From 1987, <b>amalgam</b> <b>separators</b> were produced. In 1989, the first X-ray film developer with dip tank technology was brought onto the market. Crystallisation of the chemicals on the rollers is prevented, thus ensuring lasting optimal image quality.|$|R
25|$|Those {{opposed to}} amalgam use suggest that modern {{composites}} are improving in strength. In {{addition to their}} claims of possible health and ethical issues, opponents of dental amalgam fillings claim amalgam fillings contribute to mercury contamination of the environment. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that health care facilities, including dental offices, account {{for as much as}} 5% of total waste water mercury emissions. The WHO also points out that <b>amalgam</b> <b>separators,</b> installed in the waste water lines of many dental offices, dramatically decrease the release of mercury into the public sewer system. However, critics say that the separators are not mandatory in some states of the United States. The critics also point to cremation of dental fillings as an additional source of air pollution, contributing about 1% of total global emissions.|$|R
2500|$|The American Dental Association (ADA) has {{asserted}} that dental amalgam {{is safe and}} has held that, [...] "the removal of amalgam restorations from the non-allergic patient for the alleged purpose of removing toxic substances from the body, when such treatment is performed solely at the recommendation or suggestion of the dentist, is improper and unethical". Under the comments of the American Dental Association before the FDA's Dental Products Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee, the ADA supports the 2009 FDA ruling on dental amalgam. ADA states that [...] "dental amalgam has an established record of safety and effectiveness, which the scientific community has extensively reviewed and affirmed." [...] The ADA also supports the 2017 EPA wastewater regulation and is providing information and assistance to its members in implementation of <b>amalgam</b> <b>separators.</b> The ADA asserts the best scientific evidence supports the safety of dental amalgam. Clinical studies have not established an occasional connection between dental amalgam and adverse health effects in the general population.|$|R
40|$|There’s been {{a general}} ban {{on use of}} mercury in Sweden since 2009 but it’s still {{estimated}} that the Swedish population have between 40 – 60 tons of amalgam in their teeth. Dental amalgam contains about 50 % mercury and {{studies have shown that}} despite the installation of <b>amalgam</b> <b>separators</b> mercury emissions from dental clinics still occur. Environmental officers in Swedish municipalities are important in the work to reduce mercury emissions from dental clinics in Sweden. The purpose of this report was to investigate how Swedish municipalities carry out supervision of mercury management in dental clinics as well as to investigate the legislative demands on the mercury management in dental clinics. The purpose was also to investigate possible similarities and differences between municipalities with varying populations. Environmental officers in Swedish municipalities answered a web survey. The results show that the knowledge about mercury management in dental clinics is greater among environmental officers in larger municipalities compared to smaller municipalities. Some of the smaller municipalities don’t carry out any inspections of dental clinics whereas every larger municipality does. Larger municipalities have higher demands on mercury management in dental clinics than smaller municipalities. The legislations used are broadly the same among the municipalities but because the demands made by the municipalities differ, it indicates that the interpretation of the legislations vary between municipalities in Sweden. Collaborations between different municipalities, more distinct guidelines and guidance are probably necessary to achieve a consensus amongst the municipalities when it comes to mercury management in dental clinics...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{assess the}} {{knowledge}} and attitudes of dental practitioners regarding the disposal of amalgam waste from dental practices and to assess the level of mercury released via dental amalgam waste into the environment in Trinidad and Tobago. Method: A questionnaire on dental wastewater discharge and amalgam waste disposal was administered to dental practitioners in Trinidad and Tobago. Levels of mercury in samples of wastewater and solid deposits obtained during removal of 160 amalgam fillings, were measured using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. The numbers of amalgam fillings placed and removed over a monthly period from {{a random sample of}} dental practices in Trinidad and Tobago were also obtained via the questionnaires. The amount of mercury entering the environment from dental practices was estimated from these data. Results: Twenty per cent responded to the questionnaire. Thirty per cent of respondents used elemental mercury (from a dispenser), while 74. 4 % used pre-capsulated mercury for preparing amalgam fillings. Seventy nine per cent used chair-side traps and filters but none had <b>amalgam</b> <b>separators</b> in their surgery. Methods used to dispose of amalgam waste included disposal in the trash (48. 8 %), washing down the sink (39. 5 %); and as hazardous waste (37. 2 %). A mean concentration of 0. 0759 ppm (or mg/L) mercury was found in filtrate from the wastewater samples. A total concentration of 3. 4 g mercury per dentist per day was found to be released into the environment via dental amalgam waste in Trinidad and Tobago. Conclusion: Best management practices for disposal of dental amalgam waste are not generally followed. At 3. 4 gms per day per dentist, the level of mercury released via dental amalgam waste into the environment in Trinidad and Tobago may be too high. Dental practitioners require education on the management of dental amalgam waste and national legislation to protect the environment from this source of mercury may be required...|$|R
40|$|Other than rare reports 1 – 6 {{of contact}} hypersensitiv-ity reaction, {{there is still}} no {{evidence}} that dental amalgam is a threat {{to the health of the}} general population. In fact, recent studies 7 – 9 have reported that adverse health effects in some individuals may be psychoso-matic. Nevertheless, the use of amalgam remains controver-sial because of other safety concerns, 10 – 12 notably the fate of mercury that is bound in the waste dental amalgam that enters the environment through various waste streams. 13 – 17 Anthropogenic mercury from many sources contaminates the biosphere and the aquatic food chain, 18 – 22 and some authors 23, 24 consider dentistry to be an important contribu-tor to this problem. Arenhölt-Bindslev 13, 14 has described the cycle of mercury from amalgam used in dental practice. Bindslev and Larsen 25 and Arenhölt-Bindslev 13, 14 have reported high concentrations of mercury in the waste water exiting dental clinics not equipped with high-efficiency <b>amalgam</b> particle <b>separators.</b> However, accurately calculating the total poten-tial contribution from dentistry to the annual flux of anthropogenic mercury has been difficult because of the lack of reliable estimates of the weights of amalgam restorations. 23, 24 A literature search yielded just one study providing such estimates, and that study gave the weights of only 10 restorations from 5 subjects. 26 This number of restorations is far too small to yield reliable estimates.
