The volunteer, Rance Pugmire, informed the press that Knight would not be attending the press conference, when in reality, Knight was running a few minutes late and had planned on attending per NCAA rules. Knight was shown saying: [...] "You've only got two people that are going to tell you I'm not going to be here. One is our SID , and the other is me. Who the hell told you I wasn't going to be here?

Ryan uses that idea against her, and walks out claiming he doesn't know if he can trust her. On his way out, he runs into Weston who says he is leaving to go home. Despite Ryan trying to make him stay, Weston has his mind made up, as he feels too mentally unstable to continue working on the case after lashing out on Luke. He tells Ryan that his dad won't talk {{to him because he}} doesn't understand Weston's instability.|$|R
2500|$|From 1999 onwards, {{a renewed}} process was set into motion by the Tajik Ahmad Shah Massoud and the Pashtun Abdul Haq to unite all the ethnicities of Afghanistan. While Massoud united the Tajiks, Hazara and Uzbeks {{as well as}} some Pashtun {{commander}}s under his United Front command, the famed Pashtun commander Abdul Haq received increasing numbers of defecting Pashtun Taliban as [...] "Taliban popularity trended downward". Both agreed to work together with the exiled Afghan king Zahir Shah. International officials who met with representatives of the new alliance, which Pulitzer Prize winner Steve Coll referred to as the [...] "grand Pashtun-Tajik alliance", said, [...] "It's crazy that you have this today ... Pashtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazara ... They were all ready to buy in to the process ... to work under the king's banner for an ethnically balanced Afghanistan." [...] Senior diplomat and Afghanistan expert Peter Tomsen wrote: [...] "The ‘Lion of Kabul’ [...] and the ‘Lion of Panjshir’ ... Haq, Massoud, and Karzai, Afghanistan’s three leading moderates, could transcend the Pashtun—non-Pashtun, north-south divide." [...] The most senior Hazara and Uzbek leader were also part of the process. In late 2000, Massoud officially brought together this new alliance in a meeting in Northern Afghanistan to discuss, among other things, [...] "a Loya Jirga, or a traditional council of elders, to settle political turmoil in Afghanistan". [...] That part of the Pashtun-Tajik-Hazara-Uzbek peace plan did eventually materialize. An account of the meeting by author and journalist Sebastian Junger says: [...] "In 2000, when I was there ... I happened to be there in a very interesting time. ... Massoud brought together Afghan leaders from all ethnic groups. They flew from London, Paris, the USA, all parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India. He brought them all into the northern area where he was. He held a council of ... prominent Afghans from all over the world, brought there to discuss the Afghan government after the Taliban. ... we met all these men and interviewed them briefly.

After having discussions with several different producers, the group were approached by Jacquire King in early February. King offered the band the chance to record in Nashville, Tennessee, and [...] "literally three days later," [...] according to Franceschi, the band boarded a plane to Nashville. The group was so eager to record that they flew before their management {{had been able to}} figure out accommodation in the city. In the past, the group had [...] "screaming matches with some of our producers," [...] according to Franceschi; to avoid stressing out King or themselves, the band's management recommended they took a meditation class prior to recording.|$|R

50|$|When Bulgya dies, the {{brothers}} are drawn together. They bury {{their father and}} promptly leave the village. But {{as soon as they}} pass the gates, a band of horsemen in Red Army uniforms burst into the village, killing the villagers, and burning their homes. The brothers set off in pursuit without <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>who</b> they are chasing. Are they really Red Army officers? Or are they White Guards in disguise? Eventually Stepan recognises a fellow soldier from the White Guards and realises his loyalties are divided. He tries to play both sides, first betraying his brothers to the White Guards, and then helping them to escape. Fyodor and Mitka take a White Colonel prisoner, and on his way from the estate, Stepan hears gunshots. Rushing off after them, he realises he has become a stranger to the Whites as well.|$|R
500|$|Despite the {{grandeur}} of Florence, Etty was severely depressed, writing to his brother on 5October that [...] "I feel so lonely, {{it is impossible for}} me to be happy" [...] and complaining of [...] "the vermin in the bed, the dirt and the filth" [...] which he considered [...] "such as no Englishman can have <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> of, <b>who</b> has not witnessed it". His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26October 1816. In Paris he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere too rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.|$|R
5000|$|Reviewing for the Chicago Tribune, Michael Wilmington {{summarized}} that [...] "This {{movie is}} {{fun to watch}} in ways that most recent cartoons aren't. It's also more adult, though it's the same cartoonish sensuality as the original [...] "Road" [...] movies, with their heavily coded prurience. It's a high-spirited movie, though it's not for all tastes. The John-Rice score isn't as rousingly on-target as The Lion King. The script, while clever, often seems too cute and show-biz snazzy, not emotional enough." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum, reviewing for Entertainment Weekly, remarked that [...] "this trip down The Road to El Dorado proceeds under the speed limit all the way. Our Tulio and Miguel aren't big enough, nor strong enough, nor funny enough to buckle any swashes. They're as lost to us as the lost city into which they stumble." [...] Similarly, animation historian Charles Solomon remarked {{on the lack of}} character development writing [...] "Tulio and Miguel move nicely, but the animators don't seem to have <b>any</b> more <b>idea</b> <b>who</b> they are than the audience does. Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh supply their voices, but the characters say and do similar things in similar ways. Who can tell them apart?" [...] Paul Clinton of CNN wrote, [...] "The animation is uninspiring and brings nothing new to the table of animation magic," [...] praising the Elton John/Tim Rice songs, but noting the weak plot.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the lower}} {{prevalence}} of HIV in South Korea, the Korean media has represented HIV as a disease brought to Korea by foreigners from other countries.

This may be a problem for foreigners who want to work in South Korea. The Korean government has also provided financial funding in order to reduce, and to assist those already living with the immunodeficiency virus for Korean citizens.

5000|$|Younes told Melinda Houston of The Age that Casey {{has come}} from the [...] "wrong side of the tracks". Casey wants to [...] "establish himself on the {{straight}} and narrow", while his brothers show little interest in following his example. Casey finds it hard to shake off the Braxtons' bad reputation and distance himself from his brothers. Although; Younes has opined that Casey does try to [...] "break out of the mould set by his older brothers". Casey is a mixed up young man; Younes said that portraying Casey's confusion [...] "screwed" [...] with his head because he had previously been in a similar situation. Casey {{was the first of the}} Braxton brothers to befriend some of the locals of Summer Bay. He forges friendships with Ruby Buckton (Rebecca Breeds), Xavier Austin (David Jones-Roberts) and Dexter Walker (Charles Cottier). Casey is also the first to display [...] "softer emotions"; which often surface when he shares scenes with Ruby, who becomes Casey's love interest. Younes told a reporter from Channel 5 that Casey is not a [...] "bad boy" [...] role. Younes was attracted to the part of Casey because he is [...] "a product of his two older brothers and their clashing personalities". He has both sensitive and volatile sides to his persona. Younes explained that as the [...] "epitome of teenage angst", Casey does not have <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>who</b> he is. He does not know how to act around others and can be impressionable. Casey also has deep rooted issues with his anger; Younes said that he empathised with the way Casey feels due to his previous experiences.|$|R
