5|$|Disorders of the maxillary sinus can be {{referred}} to the upper back teeth. The posterior, middle and anterior superior alveolar nerves are all closely associated with the lining of the sinus. The bone between the floor of the maxillary sinus and the roots of the upper back teeth is very thin, and frequently the apices of these teeth disrupt the contour of the sinus floor. Consequently, acute or chronic maxillary sinusitis can be perceived as maxillary toothache, and neoplasms of the sinus (such as <b>adenoid</b> cystic carcinoma) can cause similarly perceived toothache if malignant invasion of the superior alveolar nerves occurs. Classically, sinusitis pain increases upon Valsalva maneuvers or tilting the head forward.|$|E

Rarer still are melanomas and lymphomas of the upper aerodigestive tract.|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} {{caused by}} enlarged <b>adenoids</b> are mostly due to where this lymphoid tissue is located. The <b>adenoids</b> {{are in the}} midline of the nasopharynx, and the Eustachian tubes open from either ear {{to the right and}} left of them. In children with excessive middle ear infections and chronic middle ear fluid, there is a high bacterial count in the <b>adenoids</b> as compared to children without problematic otitis media, even if the size of the <b>adenoids</b> is small. The <b>adenoids</b> in these cases provides a reservoir of pathogenic bacteria that cause ear infections and subsequent middle ear effusions (fluid).|$|R
50|$|There is {{very little}} lymphoid tissue in the {{nasopharynx}} of young babies; humans are born without substantial <b>adenoids.</b> The mat of lymphoid tissue called <b>adenoids</b> starts to get sizable {{during the first year}} of life.

40|$|The {{core of the}} <b>adenoids</b> {{contains}} polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic {{flora and}} also includes potential respiratory pathogens. Similar flora, although in higher numbers and with a higher frequency of pathogens, are found in inflamed or hypertrophic <b>adenoids</b> {{and many of these}} bacteria are resistant to antimicrobial agents. Exposure to antimicrobial therapy can alter the colonization patterns and select for resistant organisms. Production of β-lactamase {{is one of the major}} mechanisms of resistance of these organisms. The <b>adenoids</b> of healthy individuals, in contrast to those with recurrent respiratory tract infections, are generally colonized by aerobic and anaerobic organisms that are capable of interfering with the growth of potential pathogens. Maintaining the beneficial effects of normal flora by avoiding unnecessary exposure to anti-microbial therapy may be a useful tool in preventing colonization of the <b>adenoids</b> by potential pathogens. This review discusses the unique microbiology of the <b>adenoids</b> in individuals with a variety of pathological conditions, the interactions between the various organisms and the effects of antimicrobial therapy on the microbial flora of the <b>adenoids...</b>|$|R
25|$|Microscopically, {{there are}} four {{architectural}} and cytological types (patterns) of hepatocellular carcinoma: fibrolamellar, pseudoglandular (<b>adenoid),</b> pleomorphic (giant cell) and clear cell. In well-differentiated forms, tumor cells resemble hepatocytes, form trabeculae, cords, and nests, and may contain bile pigment in the cytoplasm. In poorly differentiated forms, malignant epithelial cells are discohesive, pleomorphic, anaplastic, giant. The tumor has a scant stroma and central necrosis because of the poor vascularization.|$|E

50|$|Surgical {{removal of}} the <b>adenoids</b> is a {{procedure}} called adenoidectomy.

40|$|Summary. The {{effect of}} atopy (familial allergy) on the {{relationship}} of some craniofacial structures was studied cephalometrically in 100 11 -year-old school-children. Seventeen children with neither atopy nor enlarged <b>adenoids</b> formed a control group. The atopic children were divided into three groups, those with moderate to severe atopy, those with mild atopy and those with possible atopy. The size of the <b>adenoids</b> was determined from lateral skull radiographs. In moderate or severe nasal allergy there was a dorsal rotation of the mandibular body and an anterior lowering of the nasal floor. The findings were similar to those seen in children with enlarged <b>adenoids.</b> The difference was more pronounced between the control group and the children with atopy and enlarged <b>adenoids...</b>|$|R

During his father's tenure as Secretary of War, he was a frequent playmate of President Theodore Roosevelt's children. On the morning of May 17, 1909, the same day his mother suffered a severe stroke, he underwent a [...] "bloody <b>adenoid</b> operation." [...] Taft dropped out of Yale University in order to serve in the United States Army during World War I and later returned to graduate in 1918, and then earned his law degree from Yale Law School in 1921.

50|$|The <b>adenoids,</b> {{like all}} lymphoid tissue, enlarge when infected. Although lymphoid tissue does act to fight infection, {{sometimes}} bacteria and viruses can lodge within it and survive.

Some viruses, such as the Epstein-Barr Virus, can cause dramatic enlargement of lymphoid tissue. Primary or reactivation infections with Epstein Barr Virus, and certain other bacteria and viruses, can even cause enlargement of the adenoidal pad in an adult whose <b>adenoids</b> had previously become atrophied.|$|R

40|$|By {{conducting}} the salpingoscopic examinations of 47 patients suffering from {{diseases of the}} ear, the author investigated <b>adenoids</b> in Rosenmuller's fossa (R. fossa), various adhesions, and behaviors of Torus tubaris {{at the time of}} swallowing; and obtained the following results. In most of chidren <b>adenoids</b> at the angle observable with the salpingoscope appeared to cover up the entire length of Torus tubaris and in youngsters up to the age of 17 years <b>adenoids</b> appeared to cover up a portion of Torus tubaris or to be touching it. In adults over 18 years old as well as in old persons string-like, band-like, and sheet-like adhesions were observed mainly in the upper commissure, running parallel to Torus tubaris and bridging either at the posterior upper part or the posterior lower part. From these salpingoscopic examinations carried on the patients with aural diseases it has been clarified that <b>adenoids</b> in children and various adhesions in adults interfere with the backward and upward movements of Torus tubaris thus causing tubal stenosis...|$|R

40|$|Subepithelial and intraepithelial {{lymphocytes}} {{of human}} <b>adenoids</b> and tonsils were characterized and directly compared {{to determine the}} potential contribution of these tissues to mucosal and systemic immune responses. The distribution of T and B cell subsets, cytokine patterns, and antibody (Ab) isotype profiles were similar for <b>adenoids</b> and tonsils. Both tissues contained predominantly B cells (∼ 65 %), approximately 5 % macrophages, and 30 % CD 3 + T cells. The T cells were primarily of the CD 4 + subset (∼ 80 %). Tonsillar intraepithelial lymphocytes were also enriched in B cells. The analysis of dispersed cells revealed a higher frequency of cells secreting IgG than IgA and the predominant Ig subclass profiles were IgG 1 > IgG 3 and IgA 1 > IgA 2, respectively. In situ analysis also revealed higher numbers of IgG- than IgA-positive cells. These IgG-positive cells {{were present in the}} epithelium and in the subepithelial zones of both tonsils and <b>adenoids.</b> Mitogen-triggered T cells from tonsils and <b>adenoids</b> produced both Th 1 - and Th 2 -type cytokines, clearly exhibiting their pluripotentiality for support of cell-mediated and Ab responses. Interestingly, antigen-specific T cells produced interferon-γ and lower levels of interleukin- 5. These results suggest that <b>adenoids</b> and tonsils of the nasopharyngeal-associated lymphoreticular tissues represent a distinct component of the mucosal-associated lymphoreticular tissues with features of both systemic and mucosal compartments...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of mononuclear cell subsets {{has been studied}} in human <b>adenoids,</b> tonsils and peripheral blood (PB) by evaluating the presence of surface immunoglobulins, E-rosette formation, receptors for IgG Fc and for complement, alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) cytochemistry, reactivity with peanut lectin (PNA) and with monoclonal antibodies (McAb) (OK panel). <b>Adenoids</b> and tonsils, compared to PB, contain (1) fewer macrophages and T cells but more B cells; (2) higher proportions of ANAE negative, complement receptors and Ia-like antigens bearing T lymphocytes; (3) higher percentages of cells reacting with the McAbs OKT 9 and OKT 10 ("immature" lymphoid cells). In both <b>adenoids</b> and tonsils, clusters, formed by a central heavily ANAE stained interdigitating cell surrounded by lymphocytes with a sickle-shaped ANAE reaction, were found. Analogous clusters have been previously described in mice and human thymus.
