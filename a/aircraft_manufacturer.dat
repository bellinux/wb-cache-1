5|$|The Avro Vulcan (later Hawker Siddeley Vulcan from July 1963) is a jet-powered {{tailless}} {{delta wing}} high-altitude strategic bomber, which was {{operated by the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) from 1956 until 1984. <b>Aircraft</b> <b>manufacturer</b> A.V. Roe and Company (Avro) designed the Vulcan in response to Specification B.35/46. Of the three V bombers produced, the Vulcan was considered the most technically advanced and hence the riskiest option. Several scale aircraft, designated Avro 707, were produced to test and refine the delta wing design principles.|$|E
5|$|British <b>aircraft</b> <b>manufacturer</b> Avro built {{a factory}} in south Chadderton in 1938–39, later known as BAE Chadderton. It {{was one of the}} largest {{employers}} in the area, producing a variety of aircraft models including Ansons, Manchesters and Bristol Blenheims. During the Second World War, 3,050 Avro Lancaster bombers were built at the Chadderton factory—over 40percent of the Royal Air Force's fleet. Post World War Two the Avro Vulcan was designed and built, as well as the Avro Shackleton and Avro Lincoln. After the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977, Avro became part of the nationalised British Aerospace (now BAE Systems) and produced commercial aircraft for Boeing and Airbus.|$|E
5|$|Drukair {{became the}} launch {{customer}} for the Avro RJX-85 in April 2000 when it placed an order with BAE Systems for two aircraft, with deliveries initially {{scheduled to take}} place in November 2001 and January 2002. Delays in the first flight and certification of the RJX pushed back expected delivery to Drukair to after April 2002. BAe Systems cancelled the RJX program in November 2002, due to receiving orders from only two airlines, Drukair and British European. With British European threatening legal action to enforce their contract with BAE Systems, the <b>aircraft</b> <b>manufacturer</b> offered to fulfil the contract for Drukair, although airline management decided against acquiring the aircraft, citing potential problems with sourcing spare parts for the aircraft in future.|$|E

5|$|While {{stationed}} in England, Howell attended an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 13 December 1918, {{where he was}} presented with his Distinguished Service Order and Military Cross by King George V. Howell was discharged from the Royal Air Force on 31 July 1919. That year, the Australian Government offered a prize of £10,000 to the first aviator to pilot a British or Commonwealth-built aircraft from England to Australia within a period of 30 days. On 15 August, Howell was approached by British <b>aircraft</b> <b>manufacturer</b> Martinsyde {{to take part in}} the race flying their Type A Mk.I aircraft, powered by a Rolls-Royce engine; he accepted the offer. He was to be accompanied by Lieutenant George Henry Fraser, a qualified navigator and engineer who had served with the Australian Flying Corps during the war.|$|E
5|$|Torrijos {{died in a}} {{plane crash}} on July 31, 1981. A later {{investigation}} by the <b>aircraft</b> <b>manufacturer</b> stated it was an accident; Noriega's authority over the government investigation led to speculation about his involvement. Florencio Flores Aguilar had inherited Torrijos position, but true power lay with the trio of Noriega, Díaz Herrera, and Rubén Darío Paredes, who ranked just below him. Flores was removed in a quiet coup on March 3, 1982, after which Paredes was made leader until 1983 by general agreement, after which the military would work together to ensure his election as the president in the election scheduled for 1984. During this period Noriega became a full Colonel and the National Guard's chief of staff, effectively the second-highest rank in the country. He reformed the National Guard as the Panama Defense Forces (PDF), and with the financial assistance of the U.S., expanded and modernized it. The quick promotions they received earned him the officer corps' loyalty. Among the steps he took to consolidate his control was to bring the various factions of the army together into the PDF. On August 12, 1983, in keeping with Noriega's earlier deal with Paredes, Paredes handed over his position to Noriega, newly appointed a General, with the understanding that Noriega would allow him to stand for President. However, Paredes never received the political support he expected, and after assuming his new position Noriega reneged on the deal, telling Paredes he could not contest the election. Noriega, now head of the PDF, thus became the de facto ruler of Panama.|$|E

40|$|The main {{argument}} {{of this paper}} is that <b>aircraft</b> <b>manufacturers</b> are no longer &# 039;simply&# 039; manufacturers, or even system integrators, but are becoming solution integrators. This requires that <b>aircraft</b> <b>manufacturers</b> have an inherent intelligent service supplier capability residing within the organization to meet the need of increasingly complex, and blurred, product service systems...|$|R
