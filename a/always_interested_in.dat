5|$|<b>Always</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> {{military}} history, Kippenberger {{joined the}} local {{unit of the}} New Zealand Cadet Corps and found that he enjoyed soldiering. His father did not approve of his interest but regardless, Kippenberger enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) in late 1915 {{at the age of}} 18. Because only men between the ages of 19 and 45 were required to register for service, he falsified his age to ensure that he would be eligible for duty overseas.|$|E
5|$|Blamey was <b>always</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> {{technical}} innovation, and was {{receptive to}} unorthodox ideas. He {{was instrumental in}} the adoption of the periscope rifle at Gallipoli, a device which he saw during an inspection of the front line. He arranged for the inventor, Lance Corporal W. C. B. Beech, to be seconded to division headquarters to develop the idea. Within a few days, the design was perfected and periscope rifles began to be used throughout the Australian trenches.|$|E
5|$|I heard {{dance and}} techno and was <b>always</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> it but didn't really {{know where to}} go. But I went to a club one night and saw that people were losing their mind to these dance tracks. It wasn't really that I wanted to mimic that sound. I just wanted to have that energy and have people going crazy. So I knew the fusion was putting R with trance.|$|E

25|$|<b>Always</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> {{independence}} from the British, Maududi lost faith in the Congress Party and its Muslim allies in the 1920s as the party developed an increasingly Hindu identity.

25|$|Despite the {{political}} climate, Tokarev undertook valuable {{work in the}} late 1920s and the 1930s. He spent less time on Australia and Melanesia and {{more time on the}} people of Siberia and Yakutia, perhaps due to political pressure, although he was <b>always</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> both subjects. He made his first field trip in September 1928 in Turkmenistan, and in 1930 visited the Altai Mountains.|$|E
25|$|Denis McLoughlin {{was born}} on 15 April 1918, in Bolton, Lancashire, England, where he still resided {{at the time of}} his death, 22 April 2002. <b>Always</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> drawing, McLoughlin credits his artistic {{influence}} as film, pulp magazines (particularly the covers), and American comics. In the 1930s he collected American True Detective type magazines and American pulp magazines. McLoughlin also sought out the work of Alex Raymond (Flash Gordon, Secret Agent Corrigan) who he also calls an influence. On scholarship, in 1932, he attended the Bolton School of Art, which survives today as the Bolton College of Art, but left the same year for employment with Ward & Copley Art Studio of Oxford Road, Manchester. At Ward & Copley from 1932 until about January 1940 when lack of business ended his employment, McLoughlin found himself creating product illustrations for catalogues and newspaper advertisements for 10/- a week.|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} Strange Days was {{originally}} conceived by director James Cameron around 1986. He eventually {{presented it to}} his former wife and director Kathryn Bigelow, who immediately found it impressive. According to her, [...] "These two characters {{on the eve of}} the millennium, with one character trying to get the woman who loves him to help him save the woman he loves. It's this great emotional matrix." [...] After a series of dialogues, Cameron and Bigelow developed the film's society and political element. Cameron focused more on the romantic side, while Bigelow centered more on [...] "the edginess, the grit" [...] part of the film, which was something she was <b>always</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in.</b> Cameron later wrote a 90-page treatment based on these dialogues, stating that [...] "It was practically a novel, but it was unwieldy; it needed structure." [...] The treatment was then presented to screenwriter Jay Cocks, who turned it into a script. Cameron felt that the resulting script was very well structured and only did a dialogue polish on top of it.|$|E

500|$|Eastwood {{began working}} on smaller, more {{personal}} projects and experienced a lull in his career between 1988 and 1992. <b>Always</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> jazz, he directed Bird (1988), a biopic starring Forest Whitaker as jazz musician Charlie [...] "Bird" [...] Parker. Alto saxophonist Jackie McLean and Spike Lee, son of jazz bassist Bill Lee and a long time critic of Eastwood, criticized the characterization of Charlie Parker remarking {{that it did not}} capture his true essence and sense of humor. Eastwood received two Golden Globes for the film, the Cecil B. DeMille Award for his lifelong contribution, and the Best Director award. However, Bird was a commercial failure, earning just $11million, which Eastwood attributed to the declining interest in jazz among black people. Carrey would appear with Eastwood again in the poorly received comedy Pink Cadillac (1989). The film is about a bounty hunter and a group of white supremacists chasing an innocent woman (Bernadette Peters) who tries to outrun everyone in her husband's prized pink Cadillac. The film failed both critically and commercially, earning barely more than Bird and marking a low point in Eastwood's career.|$|E
500|$|For a few years, Wessel lived {{a double}} life, as a middle-class {{university}} law student, {{and as a}} member of the primarily working-class SA, but in some ways the two worlds were converging in ideology. At university, Wessel joined a dueling society dedicated to [...] "steeling and testing physical and moral fitness" [...] through personal combat, while with the brownshirted SA, which was <b>always</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> a good street fight, he was immersed in the anti-Semitic attitudes typical of the extreme right-wing paramilitary culture of the time. His study of jurisprudence at school was seen through the filter of his belief that the application of the law was primarily an instrument of power, and his personal beliefs, already geared toward anti-Jewish attitudes, were heavily influenced by the novel From Double Eagle to Red Flag, by the Russian Cossack general Pyotr Nikolayevich Krasnov, which was published in Germany in 1922. The anti-Semitic Krasnov accepted as fact The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a hoax which purported to show the plans of [...] "International Jewry" [...] to control the world. According to Wessel's sister, Krasnov's book was tremendously influential with her brother.|$|E
500|$|Druckmann {{considers}} A Second Chance at Sarah to be a [...] "personal story" [...] that he [...] "wanted to tell". As a child, he was <b>always</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> {{creating a}} comic book, and his ideas developed as he aged. The novel {{was inspired by}} Druckmann's interest in traveling {{back in time to}} meet his wife at a younger age. [...] "There's something cute and poetic about that idea," [...] he explained. This idea itself was inspired by time travel stories, particularly the Back to the Future film series (1985–90). Druckmann felt that A Second Chance at Sarah is [...] "a love story driven by grounded characters", not about the demons or time travel featured in the story; he considered the latter a [...] "secret weapon" [...] to attract more readers, and found it necessary to advance the story. Druckmann considered the characters [...] "interesting, yet flawed", and he and Wong worked to [...] "portray the subtlety of emotions". Druckmann felt that he shared many similarities with the novel's protagonist Johnny, and that [...] "a lot of Johnny's flaws and fears are based on [...] own shortcomings". He used the character to deal with his own fears of adulthood and of losing his wife, considering Johnny an [...] "exaggerated version" [...] of himself.|$|E

500|$|Like her 2000 studio album, Music, Madonna {{enlisted the}} help of French DJ and {{producer}} Mirwais Ahmadzaï. <b>Always</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> adapting herself and her music to the contemporary compositions, Madonna was inspired by the new Massive Attack and Lemon Jelly albums. [...] "We set out to put the two worlds of acoustic and electronic music together," [...] said Madonna. [...] "It is another step on, but I've never wanted to repeat myself. I don't ever want to repeat myself or make the same record twice." [...] American Life became Madonna's final studio album with Maverick Records, and marked the end of an eleven-year recording history with the label. In an interview with VH1 titled Madonna Speaks, the singer discussed her 20 years in the music industry, and revealed her motivations behind American Life, about [...] "material things" [...] being unimportant. [...] "I have lots of 'material' things and I've had lots of beliefs about things and what's important, and I look back at the 20 years behind me and I realized that {{a lot of things that}} I'd valued weren't important", she concluded. Discussing her thoughts on the conception of the album, she told Q magazine that through her 20 years of being in the entertainment industry, she would have a correct opinion on fame and fortune and its perils, which would be the base of the album.|$|E

2500|$|Gerd Stern was a German Jewish refugee {{who lived}} in the San Francisco Bay Area {{starting}} in 1948.

Stern and Hill collaborated on a poetry series for KPFA, with Wallace Stevens, Alan Watts, and Grace Clements, giving Stern the opportunity to use a wire recorder for the first time.
