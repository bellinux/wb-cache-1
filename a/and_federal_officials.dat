5|$|No {{official}} {{count was}} {{taken of the}} number of people attending the inaugural ceremony, although multiple sources concluded that the ceremony had the largest audience of any event ever held in Washington,D.C. Government agencies <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>officials,</b> who coordinated security and traffic management, determined the attendance count to be 1.8million people based on information collected by several cameras and individuals on the ground. The Washington Post reported the estimated crowd size for the inaugural ceremony, and the National Park Service said it did not contest the estimate.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, state <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>officials</b> began closed-door {{negotiations}} {{about the}} possibility of extending legal cleanup deadlines for waste vitrification in exchange for shifting the focus of the cleanup to urgent priorities, such as groundwater remediation. Those talks stalled in October 2007. In early 2008, a $600million cut to the Hanford cleanup budget was proposed. Washington state officials expressed concern about the budget cuts, as well as missed deadlines and recent safety lapses at the site, and threatened to file a lawsuit alleging that the Department of Energy is in violation of environmental laws. They appeared to step back from that threat in April 2008 after another meeting of federal and state officials resulted in progress toward a tentative agreement.|$|E

5|$|On May 3, men {{claiming}} to be {{acting on behalf of}} Baxter supporters hijacked a train from Memphis, Tennessee, and arrested federal Court Justices John E. Bennett and E.J.

For several days, their whereabouts were unknown to the public <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>officials</b> began a search for the Justices. Justice Bennett was able to send a letter to Captain Rose demanding to know why they were being held by the Governor of Arkansas.

5|$|On September 20, {{two days}} after Hurricane Isabel passed the state, Governor Ruth Ann Minner made a formal request for a federal {{disaster}} declaration for the state. Later that day, President George W. Bush issued a federal disaster declaration for Delaware, one of twelve disaster declarations for the state. The declaration allowed {{for the use of}} federal disaster funds and emergency resources to help families and businesses recover from the effects of Hurricane Isabel. State <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>officials</b> opened a disaster recovery center in Georgetown and Wilmington to assist individuals who suffered losses from Isabel and the remnants of Tropical Storm Henri just days before. 761people visited the recovery centers before they closed. One week after the disaster declaration, residents began receiving checks for those who applied for aid. By about two months after the passage of Hurricane Isabel, 659 residents applied for assistance, with slightly over $1million (2003USD, $1.1million 2006USD) being distributed to the victims. 141 loan applications were received, as well. FEMA distributed about $2.5million ($ USD) in Small Business Administration loans, and also received 183 public assistance loans for repair or replacement of public facilities.|$|E

5|$|The first {{segment of}} what later became I-94 within the state, the Willow Run Expressway, was built near Ypsilanti and Belleville in 1941, with an easterly {{extension}} to Detroit in 1945. This expressway was initially numbered M-112. In the mid-1950s, state <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>officials</b> planned an Interstate {{to replace the}} original route of U.S. Highway12 (US12). By 1960, the length of I-94 was completed from Detroit to New Buffalo. Two years later, the US12 designation was dropped from the freeway. Subsequent extensions in the 1960s completed {{most of the rest}} of the route, including the remaining sections between Detroit and Port Huron which superseded the routing of US25. The last segment opened to the public in 1972 when Indiana completed its connection across the state line. Since completion, I-94 has remained relatively unchanged; a few interchanges have been rebuilt, a second span was constructed for the Blue Water Bridge, and in 1987, a plane crashed on the freeway during take off from the airport in Detroit. The routing of I-94 is notable for containing the first full freeway-to-freeway interchange in the United States, connecting to the Lodge Freeway (M-10), and for comprising the first complete border-to-border toll-free freeway in a state in the United States. The highway has one auxiliary route, I-194, which serves downtown Battle Creek, and eight business routes. Various segments have been dedicated to multiple people and places.|$|E

25|$|Raising {{financial}} support for a new eight-lane bridge over the Cooper River was a struggle 20 years in the making, prolonged by the state's insistence {{that it could not}} afford such a bridge and by Charleston's reluctance to provide any funds for the project. Several proposals were made for a toll bridge, but the mayors of Charleston and Mount Pleasant objected. When officials revealed in 1995 that the Grace Bridge scored a 4 out of 100 for safety and integrity, retired U.S. Congressman Arthur Ravenel, Jr. ran for the South Carolina Senate with a goal of solving the funding problem. He helped to establish the S.C. Infrastructure Bank and worked with local, state, <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>officials</b> to create partnerships that helped to materialize the final funding.|$|E
25|$|Various {{proposals}} to redevelop or eliminate Banneker Park {{in the late}} 1990s and throughout the 2000s also threatened to radically {{change the nature of}} L'Enfant Plaza. By the early 1990s, the park had suffered from lack of maintenance, deterioration of some of its features, and the fountain had stopped running. In 1996, the nonprofit Washington Interdependence Council won permission from the NPS, which managed the park at the time, to raise $3 million in funds to build a life-size statue of Banneker for the park and to make other improvements (such as bas relief sculptures depicting Banneker's achievements on the limestone circle surrounding the overlook). In 1997, the NPS partially restored the park (including restoring signage, getting the fountain running again, and adding a small interpretive exhibit), and D.C. <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>officials</b> sponsored a rededication ceremony there.|$|E
