500|$|Manchester United manager Ferguson was {{critical}} {{of the performance of}} referee D'Urso: [...] "I felt sorry for the referee today, it doesn't matter how much training you have in any job. It's about temperament, and I just think the lad was too nervous for that today." [...] Despite losing their fourth consecutive Charity Shield match, Ferguson did not believe it would affect his team heading into the start of the season: [...] "We certainly hope we can go on to win the title again like we have in previous years. We just need to keep the standards up and show the desire we did in the second half." [...] He was also unsure whether Liverpool would be able to challenge for the Premier League: [...] "It's difficult to assess Liverpool at the moment. They started with confidence, but then you would expect that from a team that won three trophies a few months <b>ago.</b> <b>You</b> would also expect us to be sluggish at the start, because we are bloody good at it." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to {{stepping out of}} the Jackson family shadow, Control established Jackson as one of the preeminent female artists of popular music, rivaling fellow pop star Madonna, as critics began to acknowledge their influence on the record industry and younger artists. Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Volume 8: Genres: North America (2012) documents that both women redefined house music, repackaging it [...] "as part of a global metropolitan pop aesthetic." [...] With regard to marketing singles, Paul Grein of Billboard reported: [...] "10 or 20 years <b>ago</b> <b>you</b> would have had two singles from an album at the most. Now we're in an era where Madonna is on her fifth single from the album True Blue and Janet Jackson is on her sixth from the LP Control." [...] Jackson subsequently became the first female artist to produce six top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 from a single album. Los Angeles Times writer Paul Grein wrote a segment titled [...] "The influence of Madonna and Janet Jackson", reporting Debbie Gibson's manager Doug Breitbart claimed [...] "Madonna has brought back a really strong, melodic component to pop music", while Teen Beat editor Maggie Murphy remarked [...] "Janet Jackson may have started this more than anyone else." [...] Anthony DeCurtis, author of Present Tense: Rock & Roll and Culture (1992) wrote that [...] "Madonna and Janet Jackson have produced videos that explore the female gaze," [...] and described Jackson's music video for [...] "Nasty" [...] as feminist theory on film that deconstructs the objectification of women. The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004) documented that within two years of the release of Control, [...] "a new crop of female singers (such as Paula Abdul and Karyn White) were charged with imitating Janet." [...] Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone remarked: [...] "Control—with its quintuple-platinum sales and string of hit singles—established" [...] a then-twenty-year-old Jackson [...] "as {{one of the most popular}} recording artists in the world." [...] The Guardian described the album's release as one of the 50 key events in the history of R and hip hop.|$|E

2500|$|For scenes when computer-generated robots brawl, [...] "simulcam" [...] {{motion capture}} technology, {{developed}} for the film Avatar, was used.

Simulcam puts the robots in the ring in real time, so you are operating your shots to the fight, whereas even three, four years <b>ago,</b> <b>you</b> used to operate to empty frames, just guessing at what stuff was going to look like."

"We knew {{we could}} have played better in that Test [...] The {{fact that we had}} got so close to the Blacks proved we were close to them in ability, and {{when it came to the}} third Test in Wellington, we had a sense of giving {{everything}} to salvage our reputation. New Zealand had not won a Test match against Australia in Wellington since 1982. Not so long <b>ago,</b> <b>you</b> might think, but let me tell you, that is a lifetime by New Zealand's standards. And what happened that day really angered me. We played as though our lives depended on it; we tackled them as though they were demons; we knocked them back and we kept at them, mercilessly hounding them when they had possession and flattening them in some shuddering tackles. Not surprisingly, it won us the Test, but immediately apparent was the question: why the hell hadn't we played like that in the first two Tests?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In the end, Isac {{opted to}} throw his support behind the unionist movement.

There, on December 1, the Romanian socialist clubs, together with the Romanian National Party and the various other civic forces, demanded the union with Romania [...] (see Great Union Day). According to fellow socialist Tiron Albani, Isac first sparked disagreements within the unionist gathering, after endorsing proposals that the Romanian Kingdom become a republic in exchange for union. Isac's controversial address to his peers, as cited by Grapini, stresses: [...] "a {{quarter of an hour}} <b>ago</b> <b>you</b> have approved of the resolution [...] Now you are revolted that a human idea is being expressed. Today, when three emperors have been ejected and their crowns hurled back at them! Would you be more consistent! [...] a king may well be good and wise, but he may also be a tyrant, and he'll still be king". In the end, the socialist delegation renounced its republican aims, placated by a resolution to ensure land reform and workers' rights throughout the resulting nation.|$|E

In the meanwhile, Darius hears ominous-looking people enter his chapel. When Darius does not answer the phone, MacLeod and Fitzcairn rush to the chapel to find Darius' body in the messy nave. MacLeod searches Darius' rectory and remembers various moments with Darius until he finds Darius' last clue: an old book wrapped in old Clan MacLeod tartan cloth. Darius' murderers kidnap Fitzcairn and thwart MacLeod's investigations. Following one of them, MacLeod eventually reaches their headquarters. He meets their leader, renegade Watcher James Horton (Peter Hudson), who believes all Immortals to be threats to mankind and considers Darius [...] "a malignant evil that has walked this earth {{in the form of a}} man for the last two thousand years." [...] MacLeod fights them, but Horton escapes. After setting Fitzcairn free, they return to the barge and along with Tessa and Richie scatter Darius' ashes in the Seine River while MacLeod says, [...] "Fifteen hundred years <b>ago,</b> <b>you</b> led an army of barbarians to the gates of Paris...
