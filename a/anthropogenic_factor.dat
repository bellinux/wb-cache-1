The erosive relief of the middle part of the mountains occupies absolute altitudes {{in a range of}} 1700 up to 3000 m. Gorges and narrow valleys up to 700 m. deep with steep slopes are most typical here. The relief of the given chord is notable for intensive by slope processes: talus, downfalls and rockfalls. Bush-meadow-coniferous forest chord has a composite vegetative overlying strata. Northern slopes are occupied by endemic fir-trees of Schrenk, while southern by bushes of dogrose. Also there are aspen forests, and sometimes birch woods. Bushes and small-leaved wood band (1400-1600 m) is located in a submontane part. It was affected by <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>factor,</b> which has changed a tentative vegetative overlying strata. The groves of Siverse apple-tree and wild apricot are remained.

5000|$|The city of Ferizaj has {{agricultural}} fertile lands. The {{sector of}} agriculture of the Ferizaj's region (including: Kaçanik, Štrpce, Elez han, Shtime [...] ) has potential {{because of the}} large fund of fertile land, which has supplied many factories (such as oil factory). The quality of these agricultural lands guarantees favorable conditions for the production of agricultural goods (fruits, vegetables), which can be exported outside the city/state due to good geographical position.Agriculture is the main economic sector that provides the largest part of the revenues in the postwar period, because 2/3 of the population lives in the rural areas. Farmer's products in the private sector fulfill the needs of familiar consumption, therefore, there is nothing left for trade. Ferizaj owns 16,954 ha of agricultural land and 13,315 ha of forests, in total 30,269 ha. Grains are agricultural bases for the population, livestock and industrial processing. Earlier there were dozens hectares of trees plantation, but due to the activity of the <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>factor,</b> those hectares of soil were left behind. In the villages of Ferizaj are cultivated : wheat, corn, sunflower, soya, potatoes as described in the following table: ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{ability of}} the {{ecosystems}} to generate services is vital for human well-being, economic development and even survival. The production of ecosystem services is influenced by a complex interplay of natural and <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>factors.</b> Quantitative assessment of the ecosystem services as well as natural and <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>factors</b> affecting them is a crucial aspect of sustainable environmental development and management. The paper discusses a theoretical framework for quantifying ecosystem services and their changes in response to natural and <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>factors</b> {{on the basis of}} a meta-modelling approach. The effect of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>factors</b> on the ecosystem components and services is modelled using corresponding transformation functions.

This study aims to unravel some of the <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>factors,</b> particularly with respect to their contributions to the flood in Ibadan City on 26 August 2011.

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of the cities and growth of urban population have determined an inadequate use of some terms and concepts, in order {{to include in the}} research field specific phenomena and apply appropriate preventive measures. One such concept is about the hazards occurring inside the urban territory – urban hazards. The term urban can sometimes be associated to anthropogenic/industrial hazards or social hazards, and less to natural hazards. Natural hazards in urban areas are generally common for that geographical region. There is no such thing like special urban hazards. What is specific to urban area is the <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>factor,</b> which brings to risk various risk elements, including population, through his activities, density, or buildings. As a consequence, transition from hazard to risk is faster in time and space. Another feature is the multi- and interdisciplinary character of the genetic type of hazards. The so-called natural hazards are often caused by an <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>factor.</b> In the special literature urban risk is simply defined as the risk bounded by the urban territory or area, and is classified into: natural risk; industrial and technology risk; diffused risk...|$|E

Possible explanations for {{a decline in}} seasonal spread are discussed using the Earth system model CLIMBER- 2. Simulations forced by natural and <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>factors</b> (Milankovitch forcing, solar variability, volcanism, atmospheric CO 2 concentration, deforestation) generate specific seasonal responses. While the Milankovitch forcing increased the millennial seasonal spread, and solar variability and volcanism proved ancillary in reducing the spread on the centennial timescale, the <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>factors</b> appear the primary agents to attenuate the seasonal spread. The climatic effect of the <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>factors</b> is amplified by seasonally varying feedbacks related to the albedo of changing sea-ice and snow cover...|$|R

Damming leads to habitat fragmentation, changes in water depth, alter the rates, seasonal timing, and durations of flow. These changes may in turn affect the physical, chemical, and biological features of the river systems (Sternberg 2006; Dudgeon 2011). Numerous studies on the negative impacts of damming to the river ecosystem have been reported around the world although damming may provide other benefits to the human societies (Finer and Jenkins 2012; McClain 2013).|$|E

Ten surface soil samples were collected and analyzed for major ions and heavy metals during the dry season. Average cation concentration observed was: Ca>K>Na>Mg while the heavy metal average were: Fe>Ni>Cd>Zn>Cu>Pb. The regression analysis result indicates generally weak associations among the variables though moderate relationships were observed between Ni-K, Pb-Mg, Pb-Fe and Zn-Cu. Five indices were used for data evaluation: <b>Anthropogenic</b> <b>Factor</b> (AF), Index of Geo-accumulation (Igeo), Enrichment Factor (EF), Contamination Factor (CF) and Pollution Load Index (PLI). Except EF which gave the order of enrichment: Fe>Ni>Pb>Cu>Zn>Cd, AF, Igeo and CF reveals this order of contamination: Fe>Pb>Ni>Cu>Zn>Cd. PLI shows that the locations experienced various degrees of deterioration in this order: ITK 14 >ITK 10 >ITK 04 >ITK 02 > ITK 01 >ITK 07 >ITK 06 >ITK 05 (ITK 17) >ITK 03. R-mode factor analysis suggests that factor one is due to natural and anthropogenic influence while factors two and four are due to natural processes. Factor three points to anthropogenic origin.
