50|$|The {{action of}} igniting the arc at a {{controlled}} time, each cycle, allows the ignitron {{to dispense with}} the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>anode</b> and control grids required by other mercury-arc valves. However, a disadvantage is that the ignition electrode must be positioned very accurately, just barely touching {{the surface of the}} mercury pool, which means that ignitrons must be installed very accurately within a few degrees of an upright position.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{output voltage}} of {{automatic}} transformer-rectifier (TR) unit of impressed current cathodic protection has been controlled by using fuzzy logic controller. To prevent corrosion, voltage between the protection metal and the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>anode</b> {{has to be}} controlled on a desired level. Because soil resistance in the environment changes with humidity and soil characteristics, TRs must control the output voltage between protection metal and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>anode</b> automatically. In this study, a fuzzy logic controller has been developed for tuning output voltage of TR units. PIC 16 F 877 {{has been used to}} control the output voltage of the TR unit.

50|$|One {{functional}} {{disadvantage of}} hexavalent chromium plating is low cathode efficiency, {{which results in}} bad throwing power.

40|$|Abstract – The {{operation}} of plasma potential con-trolled hollow anode electron gun is described. The basic {{idea of this}} new modulator is to use an auxil-iary anode, {{in addition to the}} main hollow anode. The <b>auxiliary</b> <b>anode</b> could be immersed into the plasma or placed outside the hollow anode. In the latter case the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>anode</b> it is separated by a fine mesh grid and a control gap. As the electron current is extracted from the plasma by the auxil-iary anode, the plasma potential with respect to the main anode is increased. As a result, a potential barrier preventing the electrons from reaching the acceleration gap occurs near the emissive grid as well as near the walls of the hollow anode. A deep (up to 100 %) electron beam current modulation with current pulse time parameters can be accom-plished by the proper choice of the grid mesh size, control gap length, and voltage applied to it. 1...|$|E
30|$|The model {{includes}} the following: an impressed current cathodic protection system (ICCP) with a protected pipeline (pipeline 1). Pipeline 2 is located near pipeline 1 {{and has no}} applied cathodic protection. Therefore, part of the cathodic protection current that the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>anode</b> carries to pipeline 1 will flow into pipeline 2 as stray current and affects the corrosion of pipeline 2 —see Fig.  6.|$|E
30|$|Figure  9 {{reveals that}} the {{potential}} near the intersection becomes increasingly negative on increasing the crossing angle from 30 ° to 90 °. However, the change of potential within the first 100  m of the intersection is only about 30  mV. On the other hand, the calculated potential change a few hundred meters away from the intersection is relatively large. This is because the relative position between the pipeline and the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>anode</b> has changed more significantly while the location of both anode and intersection remains unchanged. This is very important when comparing the potentials of intersections.|$|E
30|$|An {{experimental}} box {{was made}} of wood, 8000  mm ×  6000  mm ×  1500  mm (length × width × height), covered with an insulating board. We also placed a PVC board under it and around it. Two steel pipes were buried inside the box: the protected pipe and the DC-interfered pipe. The parameters of the protected pipe were material Q 235 steel—no coating, outside diameter 20  mm, wall thickness 3  mm, length 6000  mm, and depth 1  m.

30|$|DC {{stray current}} can cause severe {{corrosion}} on buried pipelines. In this study, firstly, we deduced {{the equation of}} DC stray current interference on pipelines. Next, the cathode boundary condition was discretized with pipe elements, and corresponding experiments were designed to validate the mathematical model. Finally, the numerical simulation program BEASY was used to study the corrosion effect of DC stray current that an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>anode</b> bed generated in an impressed current cathodic protection system. The effects of crossing angle, crossing distance, distance of the two pipelines, anode output current, depth, and soil resistivity were investigated. Our results indicate that pipeline crossing substantially affects the corrosion potential of both protected and unprotected pipelines. Pipeline crossing angles, crossing distances, and anode depths, our results suggest, have no significant influence. Decreasing anode output current or soil resistivity reduces pipeline corrosion gradually. A reduction of corrosion also occurs when the distance between two parallel pipelines increases.|$|E
40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} whether a passive electrode effect decreases defibrillation threshold (DFT) in multi-filament middle cardiac vein (MCV) defibrillation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twelve pigs underwent active housing (AH) insertion, with defibrillation coils placed transvenously in right ventricular apex and superior vena cava. The MCV was cannulated, and 1. 12 F, 50 mm coil electrodes (Ela Medical SA, France) were deployed in its {{right and left}} branches. Lead placement was possible in 11 of 12 animals. DFT (J, mean +/- SD) was determined by three-reversal binary search and compared between the MCV monofilament (single filament deployed) and the AH (25. 9 +/- 10. 9) and the MCV mono + passive filaments (both filaments deployed, one connected) and the AH (19. 9 +/- 11. 4); 24 % DFT reduction P = 0. 008. CONCLUSION: A bystander electrode adjacent to a monofilament electrode in the MCV reduces DFT by 24 % when compared with monofilament MCV alone.

40|$|Abstruct- Recent {{shadowgraph}} {{studies suggest}} that a target disc placed downstream of the anode of a plasma focus may become an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>anode</b> producing a second focusing event when the current sheet climbs over it after the first focus event. A model is set up, with each event assumed to comprise three phases: an axial phase, a radial phase, and a radial extension or expanded column phase. This model is seen to produce the current dip, voltage spike, and high radial speeds characteristic of a plasma focus. With two separated discs acting as auxiliary anodes downstream of the usual anode, there are now three focus events with nine phases in the computation. The equations are written in generalized form in terms of n, so that an equation, for example, applicable to the first axial phase (d, n = l), is also applicable to the second (d, n = 2) and third axial phase (d, n = 3) by putting n = 1, 2, 3 successively in the equation. The results of the model indicate that each anode produces sequentially the current dip, voltage spike, and high radial speeds characteristic of the plasma focus. These computations suggest the possibility and design of a sequential or cascading plasma focus. I...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMoving striations and anode oscillations were studied {{over a wide}} range of gas pressures and discharge currents in an argon glow discharge. Striation spacing, frequency and velocity were measured as a function of discharge current from low currents to the current for extinction of moving striations, for pressures from 1 to 16 mm Hg. Striation frequency was also measured as a function of pressure for various radii discharge tubes. The anode spot light oscillations were eliminated by use of an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>anode</b> discharge, which brought the positive column in contact with the anode and eliminated the oscillat­ing anode fall in potential. This change in the anode region produced no significant change in the striation parameters, but greatly reduced and altered the frequency of the poten­tial oscillations across the discharge tube. The potential oscillations now followed the wave form and frequency of the striation oscillations instead of the frequency of the anode spot oscillations. By use of a discharge tube, constructed with sections of different radius, moving striations in the positive column were isolated from both cathode and anode by sections of homogenous positive column in which no voltage oscillations were detectable by floating probes. This leads to the con­clusion that striations are due to an inherent instability of the positive column, and not to the effects developed by the anode or cathode.
