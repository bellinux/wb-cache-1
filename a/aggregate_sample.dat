Using the recent EQ- 5 D- 5 L for measurement, this study analyzed {{quality of life}} results and their stability over consecutive population surveys. Three cross-section surveys for representative samples of the general German population from 2012, 2013, and 2014 were evaluated using the EQ- 5 D- 5 L descriptive system and valuation by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). <b>Aggregated</b> <b>sample</b> size reached 6074. The dimension with the highest prevalence of problems was pain/discomfort (31. 7 %).

Over the 3 -year period, diabetes and heart disease had the strongest negative influence on mean VAS result. The number of reported chronic diseases cumulatively reduced mean VAS. Extreme problems in one or more dimensions were stated by only 0. 1 %– 0. 2 % of patients.

30|$|The {{sieve test}} {{required}} oven-dried sand samples; however, when the sand sample {{is mixed with}} cement paste as a mortar, the oven-dried sand sample absorbs the mixing water. Hence, {{it was necessary to}} determine the absorption rate to calculate the saturated but surface dry (SSD) condition of each sample. Furthermore, since smaller sizes of fine aggregates have higher specific surface areas, fine aggregate samples with the smaller mean size absorbed more water than the larger fine aggregates. This relates to the solid concentration of mortar and its need for a water-to-cement ratio. When this ratio is properly applied, it gives the mortar a higher yield stress and viscosity. The absorption ratio of each fine <b>aggregate</b> <b>sample</b> was evaluated based on ASTM C 128 (ASTM International 2015). Table  2 lists the fine aggregate samples’ absorption rates. The absorption ratio increased as the mean size of the fine <b>aggregate</b> <b>sample</b> decreased, as expected. Notably, for G 0.34, about 7.26 % of the highest absorption was observed.|$|E

30|$|The {{viscosity}} {{estimation error}} for G 0.34 was approximately 63 % in Table  5, and the sample gave the highest water absorption—more than {{double that of}} the other samples—as reported in Table  2. The following experiment was designed to verify that the water absorption generates error of the viscosity estimation. Two samples, G 0.45 and G 0.34, were compared. The difference in their water absorption was 3.50 %, but their packing densities were very similar, 0.633 and 0.626, respectively. Simply adding 3.50 % absorbed water to the S 60 sample allows it to maintain same solid volume fraction as G 0.45. After the absorption rate was corrected for G 0.34, the value in parentheses, the rheology parameters and difference to the predicted values were added in Table  5. The prediction of rheological properties was possible at 0.34  mm of the fine <b>aggregate</b> <b>sample</b> size, while the workability difference was observed as smaller than 0.89  mm of the fine <b>aggregate</b> <b>sample</b> size. Therefore, it can be concluded that workability decreases with decreasing particle mean size and is only influenced by water absorption in a range from 0.34 to 0.89  mm. Considering the water absorption effect keeps the Krieger–Dougherty model valid, the hydrodynamic state of the mortar samples is consistent in the range of aggregate size.|$|E
