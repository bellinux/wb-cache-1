It spent a year in Trondheim and was constantly needing repairs. However, once it was not constantly being tweaked by engineers it operated for eighteen months without any failures. The Nord-1 was installed on MS Taimyr—a newly constructed Wilh. Wilhelmsen freight vessel—on 16 June 1969. This was the world's first such on-ship computer, which both featured an automatic radar plotting aid and an <b>automated</b> <b>machine</b> room. By 1973, Norsk Data had delivered 105 units to Norcontrol.|$|E

2500|$|Ten-pin bowling is a {{sport in}} which a player (called a [...] "bowler") rolls a bowling ball down a wood-structure or {{synthetic}} (polyurethane) lane and towards ten pins positioned {{at the end of}} the lane. The objective is to score the highest pinfall by knocking down as many pins as possible. Three finger holes are drilled into a traditional bowling ball, and weights vary considerably to make the sport playable for all ages. Generally, the heavier the ball, the more pins that will topple on two equivalent shots. The pins are arranged in a triangular position by an <b>automated</b> <b>machine.</b> While professional ten-pin bowling tournaments are held in numerous countries, the sport is commonly played as a hobby by millions of people around the world.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} create a {{machining}} line layout that supports the principles of lean a systematic approach is needed to ensure that a wide range of factors are taken into consideration. Despite this, many companies today design new layouts mainly considering delivery times of machines and equipment, and available space in the factory. A combined literature and case study has aimed to identify the most important factors in a lean line layout and a supporting structure to apply these in the design or redesign of <b>automated</b> <b>machining</b> lines. Highly <b>automated</b> <b>machining</b> environments mainly distinguish themselves from the more thoroughly studied area of assembly line layouts in two ways. Primarily, <b>automated</b> <b>machining</b> lines separate the operator from the actual processing, making line balancing and productivity less dependent on the workstation design around the operator. Secondly, <b>automated</b> <b>machining</b> lines often involve a higher level of complexity, leading to a more comprehensive work load, requiring longer training times but also offering less repetitive assignments. Automation offers improved productivity, quality and ergonomics, but if the acquisition and allocation of automation is not substantiated by a well-developed strategy, automation risks contradicting lean principles by creating a more complex, rigid layout that places the machines in the center instead of the workers. Factors that are important {{in the design of the}} typically less automated assembly lines, such as minimizing the walking distance of the operator and rotating stations to provide meaningful work assignments, must in an <b>automated</b> <b>machining</b> environment give way to factors like visualization, material flow and maintenance. Visualizing a factory helps operators and managers learn and understand the factory better. Problems can be detected and corrected faster and disturbances in production can thus be reduced. A good material flow is straight with no intersecting flows, triggered by downstream demand and reduces unnecessary buffers and WIP that bind up capital and consume space. Finally, since the machines rather than the operators produce, a good maintenance is required to avoid unplanned stops. The value of teamwork and humans in production which are strongly advocated within lean remain important also in <b>automated</b> <b>machining</b> lines but acquires a new content compared to assembly lines. Teamwork in <b>automated</b> <b>machining</b> environments occur within a group of lines rather than in a single line and it is a major factor when it comes to competence development, production planning and worker satisfaction. While teamwork in assembly lines works to balance the production flow within the line, teamwork in <b>automated</b> <b>machining</b> lines has little or no effect on the line balancing. However, joint efforts in setups and in case of machine failures or worker absence help increasing productivity, and potentially smooth the production at the plant in its entirety. The empirical studies showed that there is no standardized way of working with machining line layout design and redesign, and factors considered were often coincidental and dependent on the functions and priorities of the participants at different layout meeting. To ensure that all factors are taken into consideration a supporting tool where the most important factors were divided into ten categories was developed. Layouts are evaluated and rated on one category at a time to support a systematic way of working. Ongoing discussions, adjustments and improvements to better comply with the factors are encouraged...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the effects of {{flexible}} automation on the performance of a job shop. Flexible <b>automated</b> <b>machines</b> may significantly improve the delivery performance and the flow time of jobs. The insertion of a flexible automated system in a job shop, however, also has a counter effect on the manufacturing performance. This is caused by the reduction of pooling synergy due to the dedication implied by flexible <b>automated</b> <b>machines.</b> This paper investigates by means of a simulation study to what extent the loss of pooling synergy will deteriorate job shop performance. Simulation is also used to indicate the level of efficiency of the automated machinery needed to overcome the negative effect of the loss of pooling synergy. The simulation study also highlights the importance of appropriate off-line assignment rules, which assign jobs to either the conventional or <b>automated</b> <b>machines.</b> Major conclusion of this paper is that the ‘pooling loss effect’ should be taken into account in the design and justification of new flexible automated machinery. The design of appropriate offline assignment rules, furthermore, has to be seen {{as an integral part of}} investment in new technology. ...|$|R
