40|$|Abstract. —We use {{elasticity}} {{analyses for}} three sturgeon species, the shortnose sturgeon <b>Acipenser</b> <b>brevirostrum,</b> Atlantic sturgeon A. oxyrinchus, and white sturgeon A. transmontanus, {{to calculate the}} potential to increase population growth rate, l, by improving survival and fecundity. Elasticity analysis {{is a means of}} assessing changes to l resulting from conserva-tion initiatives. The elasticity of l to survival has a characteristic profile that includes a pla-teau of high elasticity values across the young of the year and the juvenile ages. However, survival elasticity falls at maturity and declines rapidly with increasing adult age. Changes to fecundity have relatively little impact; the total of the fecundity elasticities over all ages is equal to the single young-of-the-year survival elasticity. Even though the young-of-the-year survival elasticity is equal to that of any other juvenile age, the overall opportunity for af-fecting l is strongest in the young-of-the-year age-class because of its exceptional potential for increase to survival. The juvenile and adult stages have roughly equal total survival elas-ticities. These findings are particularly relevant in understanding the contributions of hatch-eries, harvest regulations and habitat restoration as strategies for sturgeon conservation.

Shortnose sturgeons were rare; only eight fish were captured from 1990 to 1993. The five fish we tracked occupied river kilometer 16 - 96 from early January to May. The presence of gravid females and the rapid (11. 5 - 27. 0 km/d), directed upstream migrations we observed provided evidence that shortnose sturgeons may attempt to reproduce in this drainage. We also documented the disruption of spawning migrations by dams and incidental gill-net capture, which may prevent these fish from ever reaching their spawning grounds. Atlantic sturgeon juveniles were relatively common and preferred deep areas (3 ̆e 10 m) {{in the vicinity of}} the saltwater-freshwater interface (km 46).

Various bacterial organisms were isolated from the cutaneous lesions, but not from the internal viscera. Histologically, the nuclei of the intralesional and perilesional epidermal cells often exhibited margination of the chromatin {{that resulted in a}} homogenous, pale, amphophilic, tinctorial quality of the nucleoplasm consistent with a herpesvirus infection.

40|$|The shortnose sturgeon, <b>Acipenser</b> <b>brevirostrum,</b> oft {{considered}} a phylogenetic relic, {{is listed as}} an "endangered species threatened with extinction" in the US and "Vulnerable" on the IUCN Red List. Effective conservation of A. brevirostrum depends on understanding its diversity and evolutionary processes, yet challenges associated with the polyploid nature of its nuclear genome have heretofore limited population genetic analysis to maternally inherited haploid characters. We developed a suite of polysomic microsatellite DNA markers and characterized a sample of 561 shortnose sturgeon collected from major extant populations along the North American Atlantic coast. The 181 alleles observed at 11 loci were scored as binary loci and the data were subjected to multivariate ordination, Bayesian clustering, hierarchical partitioning of variance, and among-population distance metric tests. The methods uncovered moderately high levels of gene diversity suggesting population structuring across and within three metapopulations (Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeast) that encompass seven demographically discrete and evolutionarily distinct lineages. The predicted groups are consistent with previously described behavioral patterns, especially dispersal and migration, supporting the interpretation that A. brevirostrum exhibit adaptive differences based on watershed. Combined with results of prior genetic (mitochondrial DNA) and behavioral studies, the current work suggests that dispersal {{is an important factor}} in maintaining genetic diversity in A. brevirostrum and that the basic unit for conservation management is arguably the local population...|$|R

It has robust, spike-like body spines arranged in ventrolateral transverse rows; a bowl-shaped anterior sucker centered on the mouth and having minute spines on the inner anteroventral surface only; a pharynx; an inverse U-shaped ceca extending to near the posterior body end; intercecal testes comprising a pre-ovarian testicular column plus a single testis posteriorly; an extensively lobed ovary located medially and immediately posterior to the testicular column; a spherical ootype that is intercecal and post-ovarian; a Laurer’s canal; and a common genital pore. The new species is the first-named aporocotylid collected from a basal actinopterygian. It resembles the chondrichthyan aporocotylids Chimaerohemecus trondheimensis, Orchispirium heterovitellatum, and Hyperandrotrema cetorhini in having an inverse U-shaped ceca, but it is morphologically most similar to the anguilliform aporocotylid Paracardicoloides yamagutii in having that feature plus a comparable anterior sucker, a single testis posteriorly, an intertesticular ovary, and a common genital pore. Sequence data for the complete small subunit ribosomal DNA (18 S) do not refute its membership within Aporocotylidae nor its affinity to one of those aforementioned aporocotylids: A. petersoni was basal to the few teleost aporocotylids analyzed, and C. trondheimensis was the only taxon basal to A. petersoni.

40|$|A {{population}} of shortnose sturgeon (<b>Acipenser</b> <b>brevirostrum)</b> was documentedcongregating {{at the base}} of Pinopolis Dam, Cooper River, South Carolina, during the February-March spawning season. Pinopolis Dam is a peaking hydroelectric facility and navigation locklocated within the coastal plane, 77 kin upriver of the mouth of the Cooper River at Charleston. South Carolina. In a 5 -year radiotelemetry experiment, shortnose sturgeon did not pass upstreamthrough the navigation lock but congregated {{at the base of}} the dam. As a result, a study wasconducted to determine whether the tailrace was used as spawning habitat. The location isatypical of published descriptions of shortnose sturgeon spawning habitat in terms of a suite ofcharacters, including distance upriver, tide, flow characteristics, and substrate. The river is tidallyinfluenced for its entire length, and the bottom substrate in the tailrace is dominated by hard marlwith negligible fine sediments such as silt and sand. Turbine discharge varies from 0 to 329 m(3) /S subdaily: current velocities during typical hydroelectric peaking discharge exceed 3 m/s. Egg sampling showed that successful spawning (i. e., fertilized eggs and developing embryos) occurred during the three spawning seasons sampled. Spawning was detected from 27 Februarythrough 29 March 1997 - 1999) at water temperatures ranging from 11. 5 degreesC to 19. 0 degreesC (mean = 14. 5 degreesC), reaching the highest levels published for shortnosesturgeon spawning.

40|$|BACKGROUND: More {{fish have}} been afforded US Endangered Species Act {{protection}} {{than any other}} vertebrate taxonomic group, and none has been designated as recovered. Shortnose sturgeon (<b>Acipenser</b> <b>brevirostrum)</b> occupy large rivers and estuaries along the Atlantic coast of North America, and the species has been protected by the US Endangered Species Act since its enactment. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Data on the shortnose sturgeon in the Hudson River (New York to Albany, NY, USA) were obtained from a 1970 s population study, a population and fish distribution study we conducted in the late 1990 s, and a fish monitoring program during the 1980 s and 1990 s. Population estimates indicate a late 1990 s abundance of about 60, 000 fish, dominated by adults. The Hudson River population has {{increased by more than}} 400 % since the 1970 s, appears healthy, and has attributes typical for a long-lived species. Our population estimates exceed the government and scientific population recovery criteria by more than 500 %, we found a positive trend in population abundance, and key habitats have remained intact despite heavy human river use. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Scientists and legislators have called for changes in the US Endangered Species Act, the Act is being debated in the US Congress, and the Act has been characterized as failing to recover species. Recovery of the Hudson River population of shortnose sturgeon suggests the combination of species and habitat protection with patience can yield successful species recovery, even near one of the world's largest human population centers...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to assess how 2 different temperatures affect immune responses in shortnose sturgeon (<b>Acipenser</b> <b>brevirostrum)</b> relevant immune organs such as the meningeal myeloid tissue, spleen, thymus and skin. These responses were studied in 2 different sizes of same age juvenile sturgeon kept at either 11 °C or 20 °C (4 treatment groups), before and after exposure to an ectoparasitic copepod (Dichelesthium oblongum). Based on a differential cell count, temperature was found to strongly influence immune cell production in the meningeal myeloid tissue, regardless of the fish sizes considered. Morphometric analysis of splenic white pulp showed a transient response to temperature. There were no differences between the groups in the morphometric analysis of thymus size. Splenic IRF- 1 and IRF- 2 had similar expression profiles, significantly higher in fish kept at 20 °C for the first 6 weeks of the study but not by 14 weeks. In the skin, IRF- 1 was significantly higher in the fish kept at 11 °C over the first 6 weeks of the study. IRF- 2 had a similar profile but there were no differences between the groups by the end of the trial. In conclusion, higher water temperatures (up to 20 °C) may have beneficial effects in maximizing growth and improving immunological capacity, regardless of the fish sizes considered in this study...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Attraction of {{sturgeons}} to fishway entrances {{is poorly}} studied but observations on adult Shortnose Sturgeon, <b>Acipenser</b> <b>brevirostrum,</b> entering {{one of two}} fish lifts at Holyoke Dam, Connecticut River, MA, USA, indicate the benthic sturgeons need a bottom entrance with a submerged orifice if the water is deep. Sturgeons can pass upstream in nature-like or ramp fishways, or in technical fishways, like fish lifts, but not so good in traditional fish ladders. Keys to passing sturgeons in fish lifts is 1) attracting fish to the entrance by induced currents, 2) operating the lift during the seasonal (and daily diel period) of migration, 3) cycling the crowder trap within the time period fish will remain at the barrier without departing, and 4) designing the appropriate lift hopper. Adults have a moderate swimming ability and can ascend fish ladders, but they ascend best when the fish ladder design enables them to continuously swim upstream. Unfortunately, most fish ladders (e. g., pool 2 ̆ 6 weir, vertical slot) have cross walls that prevent sturgeons from continuously swimming upstream: {{an important aspect of}} their swimming style. Also, observations in an artificial ladder showed a series of ascents and descents before fish {{reached the top of the}} ladder. This suggests that any ladder for sturgeons should allow fish to descend without injury and loss of upstream ascent drive. Experiments with several species of sturgeons in a prototype sidebaffle ladder allowed fish to swim continuously during ascent and did not harm them during descent. Fish moved freely upand downstream like they might use a seminatural channel. Plans are to install the prototype at a dam in 2015 or 2016 to field test the design...|$|R

We examined effects of implantation technique on growth, tag retention, and survival of juvenile (< 55 cm) Shortnose Sturgeon <b>Acipenser</b> <b>brevirostrum</b> and Atlantic Sturgeon A. oxyrinchus by using dummy acoustic tags. Two implantation techniques were used: (1) anchoring the tag {{to the wall of}} the peritoneal cavity and (2) no internal anchoring of the tag. These treatment groups were compared with two control groups: fish that received anesthetic only and fish that received anesthetic and an incision. Retention rate was significantly higher for anchored tags (88 %) than for nonanchored tags (25 %) in Shortnose Sturgeon juveniles, while Atlantic Sturgeon juveniles retained 100 % of tags regardless of treatment. Nonanchored tags that were lost during the second week were expelled through the incision site, whereas later tag expulsions (during weeks 7 and 8) occurred through the anus. There {{was no significant difference in}} absolute growth and specific growth rates between the treatment groups throughout the 8 -week study for either species. Growth of both species was significantly lower in the first week after surgery but increased and remained constant for the remainder of the experiment. Use of nonanchored tags significantly increased incision healing times for both species; however, Atlantic Sturgeon healed significantly faster (35 d) than Shortnose Sturgeon (42 d). No mortality occurred in any of the treatment groups. Results of this study suggest that juvenile Shortnose Sturgeon and Atlantic Sturgeon can undergo internal tag implantation resulting in long retention times with largely unaffected growth and no mortality...|$|R
40|$|A {{federal and}} multi-state {{cooperative}} program to restore American shad Alosa sapidissima and Atlantic salmon Salmo salar to the Connecticut River basin was begun in 1967 and has evolved to include many other species. The program {{began in the}} last years of the Connecticut River Ecological Study, but most of its activities have occurred since the study ended. The Connecticut River Atlantic Salmon Commission manages the program. Emphasis has been placed on the provision of fish passage at barrier dams. Early fishways were justified on the basis of existing American shad runs, and later upriver fishways were built to support future salmon runs. Fishways existed at five mainstem dams and eight tributary dams, with facilities for downstream fish passage provided at many additional dams. Salmon restoration has been pursued with stocking of hatchery-reared fry and smolts, catch prohibitions, kelt reconditioning, fish health management, and various genetic management and marking schemes. Annual runs typically have numbered in the hundreds but recently have declined to less than 100 at the same time runs elsewhere through the species 2 ̆ 7 range have also declined. Annual runs of American shad, blueback herring A. aestivalis, and alewife A. pseudoharengus increased but recently experienced declines, for which stock recovery of the striped bass Morone saxatilis is thought to be at least partially responsible. Gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum and hickory shad A. mediocris experienced significant range extensions in the Connecticut River basin since the 1990 s, and the number of nonspawning striped bass that enter the river annually has increased dramatically during the same time period.

40|$|This {{study used}} {{population}} viability analysis (PVA) to partition {{the influences of}} potential threats to the endangered shortnose sturgeon (<b>Acipenser</b> <b>brevirostrum).</b> A workshop brought together experts to help identify potential threats including groundwater withdrawal, poor water quality, saltwater intrusion, mercury effects, harvest as by-catch, and sedimentation of spawning habitat. During {{the course of the}} project, we eliminated some threats and added new ones. Groundwater withdrawal was dismissed after a study failed to identify connection with groundwater and the majority of pumping is from a confined aquifer. We also eliminated activities on Fort Stewart as influences on spawning habitat because any successful spawning must occur upstream of Fort Stewart. We added climate change to the list of threats based on our assessment of temperature effects and expectations of sea-level rise. Our study highlighted the role of populations in nearby rivers in providing metapopulation support, raising the concern that the population in the Ogeechee River acts as a demographic sink. As part of this study, we carried out a field sampling study to analyze effects of training activities on headwater streams. We developed a new methodology for sampling design as part of this effort and used a mixed-modeling approach to identify relationships between land cover-land use, including those associated with military training activity and water quality. We found that tank training was associated with higher suspended sediment and equipment training was associated with higher organic carbon) and water quality. We detected effects of training on suspended sediment and organic carbon. We also carried out a field sampling effort in the Canoochee and Ogeechee Rivers. In the Ogeechee River, we found that dissolved oxygen in 40 % of measurements during summer were below 4 mg L- 1. To evaluate mercury as a potential threat, we developed a mercury uptake model and analyzed mercury levels in amphipod prey and sturgeon eggs. These did not exceed EPA guidelines. Finally, we developed a PVA model that including linkages between shortnose sturgeon growth, reproduction, and survival and each remaining threat; All three had significant influences.

Cultured juveniles (yearlings and older, larger fish), and wild adults were observed. Three mean approach bottom water velocities (30. 5 cm, 61, and 91 cm/s) {{were used in}} tests with no orifice in the rack; other tests observed sns at 61 cm/s approach velocity to the rack with an orifice (1 m 2 opening) in the rack. Underwater video camera and TIRIS PIT systems monitored sns movement and behavior at the bar rack. Most sns were oriented tail downstream when they were 60 cm upstream from the rack, so fish were backing down the flume. Initial movement at the rack of some fish in all age classes was to swim upward. No adult or older juvenile was impinged or entrained during any approach velocity. No yearling was impinged at 30. 5 cm/s, but 7. 7 â€“ 12. 5 % was impinged at 61 cm/s, and 33. 3 â€“ 40. 0 % was impinged at 91 cm/s. The entrainment of yearlings at the three approach velocities follow: 4. 3 â€“ 9. 1 % at 30. 5 cm/s, 7. 1 â€“ 27. 8 % at 61 cm/s, and 66. 7 â€“ 80. 0 % at 91 cm/s. Number of sns tracked at the rack with the orifice and the number (%) that entered the orifice follows: 21 yearlings tracked and six (28. 6 %) entered the orifice; 17 older juveniles tracked and 7 (41. 2 %) entered the orifice; nine adults tracked and zero entered. All of the 13 fish entering the orifice approached on or just above the bottom. Four swam headfirst downstream through the orifice, the remainder (nine sns) went tailfirst. Six of 13 fish swam in and out (upstream) of the orifice, the remainder swam one-way downstream through the orifice. Some juveniles (even yearlings) will enter an orifice with no attraction flow.

No protection for downstream migrants is presently available, {{and the behavior}} of sturgeon to guidance structures has not been studied. We conducted experiments in a 5. 4 -m-long × 1. 5 -m-wide flume with a water depth of 37 cm to determine the guidance efficiency and behavior of yearling shortnose and pallid sturgeon to two guidance structures, a bar rack and a louver array. We tested one vertical bar rack configuration with slats spaced 3. 9 cm apart (clear spacing). The bar rack slats were oriented directly into the approach flow, and the row of slats was oriented at a 45 ° angle to the flow. We tested two louver array configurations, one with slats spaced 3. 9 cm apart and one with slats spaced 9. 0 cm apart (clear spacing). Louver slats were oriented at a 90 ° angle to the flow, and the row of slats was oriented at a 20 ° angle to the approach flow. Mean approach velocity to both structures was 31 - 34 cm/s. Eighteen shortnose sturgeon tagged with passive integrated transponders were tested once in each configuration; 24 - 38 pallid sturgeon were tested in each configuration. Shortnose sturgeon showed some behavioral differences due to experience with the bar rack, but experience {{did not affect the}} percent guided. Both sturgeon species were guided efficiently by the louver array (96 - 100 %) but less efficiently by the bar rack (58 - 80 %). Shortnose sturgeon were more likely to contact the bar rack at night than during the day (P = 0. 01) and at night were more likely to contact the bar rack than the louver array (P = 0. 006). Bar racks guided fewer individuals at night than during the day. For pallid sturgeon, the percentages guided by day and night were 80 and 58, respectively; for shortnose sturgeon, the percentages were 80 and 67. Both species used vision to avoid structures because both increased contact with structures at night.

30|$|In {{the present}} experiment, the plasma Ca 2 + levels and GSI of C. fasciatus, {{just prior to}} {{spawning}} (in late April), were found significantly higher (P <  0.05) in PUFA-treated female compared to the control and the values started to decrease after spawning (during May) in case of treated group. The results showed a positive correlations between serum Ca 2 + concentration and GSI (r 2  =  0.9112 and r 2  =  0.8292 for treated and control group, respectively) which goes {{in line with the}} previous experiment where the existence of positive correlation between estrogens, plasma Ca 2 + concentration and vitellogenesis in teleosts was noticed (Björnsson et al. 1989). Again, Nagler et al. (1987) and Hunn et al. (1992) also reported about linear relationship between increasing levels of serum Ca 2 + and that of serum Vtg in case of female rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) and gravid female golden trout (Oncorhynchus aguabonita), respectively. Moreover, a steep decline in Ca 2 + levels during the post-spawning phases was observed by Singh and Srivastav (1990) and Reza et al. (2013). Prior to vitellogenesis, increasing level of estrogens induces calcitonin secretion which in turn increases plasma Ca 2 + level leading to Ca 2 + binding by regulatory proteins like calmodulin, which turn the Ca 2 + signal into a biological response (Clapham 2007). The difference between serum Ca 2 + levels of treated female during different months corresponded to different types of sex hormone secretion resulting in enhanced egg production. The increase in blood plasma Ca 2 + level depends on the high level of plasma estrogen secretion during sexual maturation (Lindhom 1997). In response to endogenous estrogen owing to dietary PUFAs via endocytic pathway, hepatocytes synthesize and release yolk proteins (Vtg) into the bloodstream, from where it was taken up and incorporated into growing oocytes (Shen et al. 1993). This appearance of Vtg in plasma ultimately increased the total plasma Ca 2 + (Björnsson and Haux 1985). Therefore, the level of Ca 2 + concentration in the blood serum was used as a biomarker for monitoring the gonadal maturation by introducing PUFAs in fish diet. The values of serum Ca 2 + were comparatively lower in female C. fasciatus than in other fish species. Serum Ca 2 + was measured 6.6 – 12.1  mg/dl for <b>Acipenser</b> <b>brevirostrum</b> (Knowles et al. 2006), and 7.21  mg/dl for A. fulvescens (Le Breton and Beamish 1998). These discrepancies might be due to the species differences, the blood-sampling procedure (caudal peduncle puncture versus cardiac puncture) and the influence of other blood parameters (for example, serum enzyme levels), or simply the differences between the fish collected from river, reservoir and beel or fish sizes. Another rationale may be the techniques were used to determine the serum Ca 2 + levels that may vary. In the present investigation, male C. fasciatus was not taken into account as Singh and Srivastav (1990) claimed that there exist no correlation between serum Ca 2 + level and testicular maturation.|$|R
40|$|Sturgeon are {{harvested}} worldwide for their meat and eggs, sold as caviar and {{are among the}} most economically important fish species worldwide. A generally low physiological response to external stimuli/stressors has been documented in these phylogenetically primitive species. Considering how little is known about sturgeon immune responses, it is important to study how they respond to such stimuli/stressors. The culture of sturgeon larvae is associated with a high mortality rate during and after yolk sac absorption and onset of feeding. Therefore, it is relevant to study the immune competence of larvae and juvenile sturgeon and determine when their immune organs first appear and how they develop. The meningeal myeloid tissue, the spleen and the thymus were characterized morphologically by light microscopy (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus) during the first 5 months of life (until 2895 growing degree days, °C. day (dd)). In sturgeon, the spleen was first visible approximately 400 dd after the onset of feeding (at 541 dd) and the meningeal myeloid tissue and the thymus at 768 dd after the onset of feeding; these first appeared between 541 dd and 768 dd, respectively. Heterophil and eosinophil percentages were significantly greater in the meningeal myeloid tissue of larger fish (950 and 2895 dd, respectively) when compared with the smaller fish. The percentages of reticular cells were significantly higher in the smallest fish than in the larger fish and the undifferentiated cells were higher in the youngest animals compared to the older age groups. Likewise, the splenic heterophil percentages were significantly higher in the oldest fish (2895 dd) compared to the youngest fish (768 dd). The splenic undifferentiated cell percentages were significantly higher in the younger fish compared to the oldest. This emphasizes less developed immune organs in the smaller animals. Lymphocyte percentages did not change over time in these tissues. In the thymus, lymphocytes were the predominant cell type and only the undifferentiated cell percentages were significantly different and highest in the oldest group, possibly reflecting a more proliferative thymus in these animals. In order to characterize changes in cell populations in relevant immune organs, a temperature trial was done in juvenile shortnose sturgeon (<b>Acipenser</b> <b>brevirostrum),</b> kept at 11 °C or at 20 °C. Relevant immune organs such as the meningeal myeloid tissue, the spleen, the thymus and the skin were studied. A higher temperature had a significant positive influence on the immune cell production in the meningeal myeloid tissue (higher lymphocyte, eosinophil and heterophil percentages). Likewise, temperature resulted in an initial but transient increase in splenic white pulp percentage. A similar effect was seen for splenic expression of interferon regulatory factors 1 and 2 (IRF- 1 and IRF- 2) and no changes occurred in matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP- 9) expression for both spleen and skin. IRF- 1 and IRF- 2 expression in the skin were significantly higher expression in the fish kept at 11 °C at 3 and 6 weeks post temperature change. There were no differences in thymus size between the different groups. Further research is required to better characterize the nature of these immune responses in these organs. These findings suggest that an effective immune response may not occur in early life stages prior and during the onset of feeding but {{further research is needed to}} further assess this. Rearing sturgeon juveniles at higher temperatures (up to 20 °C) may be beneficial for sturgeon aquaculture, since it maximizes growth rates and positively influences immune cell percentages in relevant immune organs...|$|R
