5|$|Ecology is {{the study}} of the {{distribution}} and abundance of living organisms, the interaction between them and their environment. An organism shares an environment that includes other organisms and biotic factors as well as local <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> (non-living) such as climate and ecology. One reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible, even on small scales. A microscopic bacterium responding to a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African savanna. For any species, behaviors can be co-operative, competitive, parasitic, or symbiotic. Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} and abundance of organisms in the LSZ {{is dependent upon}} both abiotic and biotic factors. <b>Abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> include the physical geography and hydrology of the estuary, including nutrient inputs, sediment load, turbidity, environmental stochasticity, climate and anthropogenic influences. <b>Abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> tend to drive production in the estuarine environment, and are mediated by biotic factors.|$|E
25|$|An {{ecosystem}} (also {{called as}} environment) {{is a natural}} unit consisting of all plants, animals and micro-organisms (biotic factors) in an area functioning together {{with all of the}} non-living physical (<b>abiotic)</b> <b>factors</b> of the environment.|$|E

25|$|The {{breeding}} season {{is the most}} suitable season, usually with favorable conditions and abundant food and water for breeding. <b>Abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> such as the timing of seasonal rains and winds can also {{play an important role}} in breeding onset and success.|$|E
25|$|At altitudes below 3400 meters (12,000 feet)the daily {{temperature}} fluctuations are less extreme, the average daily temperature steadily increases, {{and the growth}} forms and ecology of the Dendroseneico reflect the increased influence of biotic factors (such as competition for light) over <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> (such as nightly frost).|$|E
25|$|Many other biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> can mediate {{competition}} among EcM fungi, such as temperature, soil pH, soil moisture, host specificity, and competitor number. The results of many studies concerning these factors indicate that these interactions are largely environmentally context-dependent. These aspects can {{often lead to}} “checkerboard” distribution patterns, where certain species occupy locations that are mutually exclusive of the other species.|$|E
50|$|Species abundances usually change along {{environmental}} gradients {{in a more}} or less predictive way. However, {{the species}} abundance along an environmental gradient is not only determined by the <b>abiotic</b> <b>factor</b> but, also by the change in the biotic interactions, like competition, along the environmental gradient.|$|R

25|$|From a {{geographical}} point of view, Lüneburg Heath {{is a specific}} natural region, that is an area distinguished by a specific combination of <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> (climate, relief, water resources, soil, geology) and biotic factors (flora and fauna). Lüneburg Heath is a sub-division of the North European Plain. In {{the list of the}} major natural regions of Germany issued by the Federal Office for Nature Conservation (Bundesamt für Naturschutz) it is region number D28.|$|E
25|$|Organisms {{living in}} this zone have a highly {{variable}} and often hostile environment, and have evolved various adaptations to cope with and even exploit these conditions. One easily visible feature of intertidal communities is vertical zonation, where the community is divided into distinct vertical bands of specific species going up the shore. Species {{ability to cope with}} <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> associated with emersion stress, such as desiccation determines their upper limits, while biotic interactions e.g.competition with other species sets their lower limits.|$|E
25|$|Competition is {{only one}} of many {{interacting}} biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> that affect community structure. Moreover, competition is not always a straightforward, direct, interaction. Interspecific competition may occur when individuals of two separate species share a limiting resource in the same area. If the resource cannot support both populations, then lowered fecundity, growth, or survival may result in at least one species. Interspecific competition has the potential to alter populations, communities and the evolution of interacting species. On an individual organism level, competition can occur as interference or exploitative competition.|$|E

Windthrow {{can be considered a}} cataclysmic <b>abiotic</b> <b>factor</b> that can generate an entire new chain of seral plant succession in a given area. Windthrow can also be considered to act as a rejuvenating process whereby regeneration is made possible with new resource availability.|$|R

50|$|Temperature is an {{important}} <b>abiotic</b> <b>factor</b> in lentic ecosystems {{because most of the}} biota are poikilothermic, where internal body temperatures are defined by the surrounding system. Water can be heated or cooled through radiation at the surface and conduction to or from the air and surrounding substrate. Shallow ponds often have a continuous temperature gradient from warmer waters at the surface to cooler waters at the bottom. In addition, temperature fluctuations can be very great in these systems, both diurnally and seasonally.|$|R
25|$|The {{transition}} from macroalgal (i.e. kelp forest) to denuded landscapes dominated by sea urchins (or ‘urchin barrens’) {{is a widespread}} phenomenon, often resulting from trophic cascades like those described above; the two phases are regarded as alternative stable states of the ecosystem. The recovery of kelp forests from barren states has been documented following dramatic perturbations, such as urchin disease or large shifts in thermal conditions. Recovery from intermediate states of deterioration is less predictable and depends {{on a combination of}} <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> and biotic interactions in each case.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to ecological monitoring of kelp forests before, during, and after such disturbances, scientists try to tease apart {{the intricacies of}} kelp forest dynamics using experimental manipulations. By working on smaller spatial-temporal scales, they can control for {{the presence or absence}} of specific biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> to discover the operative mechanisms. For example, in southern Australia, manipulations of kelp canopy types demonstrated that the relative amount of Ecklonia radiata in a canopy could be used to predict understory species assemblages; consequently, the proportion of E. radiata can be used as an indicator of other species occurring in the environment.|$|E
500|$|The {{environment}} of ecosystems includes both physical parameters and biotic attributes. It is dynamically interlinked, and contains resources for organisms {{at any time}} throughout their life cycle. Like ecology, the term environment has different conceptual meanings and overlaps {{with the concept of}} nature. Environment [...] "includes the physical world, the social world of human relations and the built world of human creation." [...] The physical environment is external to the level of biological organization under investigation, including <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> such as temperature, radiation, light, chemistry, climate and geology. The biotic environment includes genes, cells, organisms, members of the same species (conspecifics) and other species that share a habitat.|$|E

40|$|Community {{proteomics}} {{applied to}} natural microbial biofilms resolves how the physiology of different populations from a model ecosystem change with measured environmental factors in situ. The initial colonists, Leptospirillum Group II bacteria, persist throughout ecological succession and dominate all communities, {{a pattern that}} resembles community assembly patterns in some macroecological systems. Interspecies interactions, and not <b>abiotic</b> environmental <b>factors,</b> demonstrate the strongest correlation to physiological changes of Leptospirillum Group II. Environmental niches of subdominant populations seem {{to be determined by}} combinations of specific sets of <b>abiotic</b> environmental <b>factors...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Other {{vertebrate}} taxa inhabit lentic {{systems as}} well. [...] These include amphibians (e.g. salamanders and frogs), reptiles (e.g. snakes, turtles, and alligators), {{and a large}} number of waterfowl species. Most of these vertebrates spend part of their time in terrestrial habitats and thus are not directly affected by <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> in the lake or pond. [...] Many fish species are important as consumers and as prey species to the larger vertebrates mentioned above.|$|E
2500|$|In anurans, 70% of {{polyandrous}} species exhibit paternal care. In Allobates femoralis the female’s offspring survival {{depends on}} the male’s carrying abilities, as {{they are responsible for}} carrying tadpoles from terrestrial to aquatic sites. [...] If a female only mates with one male and he is a poor parent, she may lose all of her offspring. Females reduce the risk of losing all of their offspring because it is likely that some of the males they mated with make good parents. Sequential polyandry will allow females to have a multiple clutches in different nest sites, reducing the risk of <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors,</b> such as temperature, or biotic factors like predators affecting development of the offspring. as cited by ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} vacant niche is not {{accepted}} by all. The reason given {{is that a}} niche is a property of a species; therefore a niche does not exist if no species is present. In other words, the term {{is thought to be}} “illogical”. However, some authors who have contributed most to the formulation of the modern niche concept (Hutchinson, Elton) apparently saw no difficulties in using the term. If a niche is defined as the interrelationship of a species with all the biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> affecting it, there is no reason not to admit the possibility of additional potential interrelationships. So, it seems logical to refer to vacant niches. (see also ecological niche.) ...|$|E
50|$|An {{ecosystem}} {{is composed}} of biotic communities that are structured by biological interactions and <b>abiotic</b> environmental <b>factors.</b> Some of the important <b>abiotic</b> environmental <b>factors</b> of aquatic ecosystems include substrate type, water depth, nutrient levels, temperature, salinity, and flow. It {{is often difficult to}} determine the relative importance of these factors without rather large experiments. There may be complicated feedback loops. For example, sediment may determine the presence of aquatic plants, but aquatic plants may also trap sediment, and add to the sediment through peat.|$|R
40|$|Fish {{assemblage}} {{was examined}} for patterns in spatial and seasonal structure within an estuarine coastal lagoon, Ria de Aveiro. Two years {{of variation in}} abiotic conditions were recorded to identify factors responsible for maintaining the structure of fish assemblages. Nine sites were sampled monthly with a traditional “chincha” beach-seine net between November 1998 and October 2000. Fish abundance and biomass changed significantly between sites. Temperature {{was found to be}} the most important <b>abiotic</b> <b>factor</b> affecting the abundance (number of fish) distribution of fish assemblage, which is more related to seasonal migrations than to spatial migrations. Salinity was the most important <b>abiotic</b> <b>factor</b> affecting the fish biomass, with temperature also having a major influence. The other abiotic parameters analysed also showed some influence on the distribution of fish, although, isolated from the other controlled and/or uncontrolled factors, they could not fully explain all the differences between assemblages. Feeding analysis indicates that fish assemblage is mostly dependent on small benthic and pelagic crustaceans and/or detritus, although they can feed opportunistically on other prey. The low spatial segregation of fish in relation to feeding preference indicates that, in a food-rich lagoon such as Ria de Aveiro, the environmental-biological interactions appear to have a greater effect on fish distribution than do biological interactions...|$|R

2500|$|Not every {{bird species}} builds or uses a nest. Some auks, for instance—including common murre, thick-billed murre and razorbill—lay their eggs {{directly}} onto the narrow rocky ledges they use as breeding sites. [...] The eggs of these species are dramatically pointed at one end, so that they roll in a circle when disturbed. This is critical {{for the survival of}} the developing eggs, as there are no nests to keep them from rolling {{off the side of the}} cliff. Presumably because of the vulnerability of their unprotected eggs, parent birds of these auk species rarely leave them unattended. Nest location and architecture is strongly influenced by local topography and other <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Restoration {{failures}} {{may occur}} when appropriate ecosystem conditions are not reestablished, such as soil characteristics (e.g., salinity, pH, beneficial soil biota, etc.), surface water and groundwater levels, and flow regimes. Therefore, successful restoration may {{be dependent on}} taking a number of both biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> into account. For example, restoration of soil biota, including symbiotic myccorhizae, invertebrates, and microorganisms may improve nutrient cycling dynamics. [...] Restoration of physical processes may be a prerequisite to the reestablishment of healthy riparian communities. Ultimately, a combination of approaches taking into account causes for degradation and targeting both hydrology and the reestablishment of vegetation and other life forms may be most effective in riparian zone restoration.|$|E
2500|$|Fish have a {{range of}} {{physiological}} tolerances that are dependent upon which species they belong to. [...] They have different lethal temperatures, dissolved oxygen requirements, and spawning needs that are based on their activity levels and behaviors. [...] Because fish are highly mobile, they are able to deal with unsuitable <b>abiotic</b> <b>factors</b> in one zone by simply moving to another. [...] A detrital feeder in the profundal zone, for example, that finds the oxygen concentration has dropped too low may feed closer to the benthic zone. [...] A fish might also alter its residence during different parts of its life history: hatching in a sediment nest, then moving to the weedy benthic zone to develop in a protected environment with food resources, and finally into the pelagic zone as an adult.|$|E
