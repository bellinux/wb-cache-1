WCAM-1's have three traction modes (series, series-parallel, parallel) in both DC and <b>AC</b> <b>mode,</b> but using the parallel mode in DC was discouraged because of power problems. In practice this was not restrictive since series-parallel notches allowed reaching 75 km/h or so. In <b>AC</b> <b>mode,</b> the locos are almost always used with the motors in all-parallel mode. Unlike the WCAM-2 and WCAM-3 locos, no reconfiguration {{has been carried out}} to force the use of all-parallel mode with AC. Weak field operation is available.

50|$|In ambient conditions, most samples {{develop a}} liquid {{meniscus}} layer. Because of this, keeping the probe tip {{close enough to}} the sample for short-range forces to become detectable while preventing the tip from sticking to the surface presents a major problem for contact mode in ambient conditions.

40|$|Live-cell imaging at the {{nanoscale}} {{resolution is}} a hot research topic {{in the field of}} life sciences for the direct observation of cellular biological activity. Scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) {{is one of the few}} effective imaging tools for live-cell imaging at the nanoscale resolution. However, there are various problems in existing scanning modes. The hopping and <b>AC</b> <b>modes</b> suffer from low speed, whereas the DC mode is prone to instability because of the DC drift and external electrical interference. In this article, we propose an amplitude modulation (AM) mode of SICM, which employs an AC voltage to enhance the stability and improve the scanning speed. In this AM mode, we introduce a capacitance compensation method to eliminate capacitance effect and use the amplitude of the AC current component to control the tip movement. Experimental results on polydimethylsiloxane samples verify the validity of the AM mode and demonstrate an improved performance of both speed and stability of this new mode...|$|R

40|$|Stability {{analysis}} of power-converter-based AC systems poses serious challenges {{not only because}} of the non-linear nature of power converters, but also because linearisation is not generally applied around a steady-state operating point, as in the DC case, but around a time-periodic operating trajectory. Typical examples are single-phase and unbalanced three-phase systems. In this paper, two general methods to assess stability of the aforementioned systems are presented. Both are based on the Linear Time Periodic (LTP) systems theory. The first is model-based and relies on the evaluation of the eigenvalues of the linearised model, assuming a complete knowledge of the parameters. By contrast, the second proposes a set of small-signal current injections to measure the Harmonic Impedances and applies the LTP Nyquist Criterion, so that stability of the system can be assessed with a black-box approach, without relying on knowledge of the system parameters. The basic LTP systems theory is reviewed in order to provide a mathematical justification for the second method. As case study, a simple network, consisting of a source full-bridge converter in <b>AC</b> voltage-control <b>mode</b> and a load full-bridge converter in <b>AC</b> current-control <b>mode</b> including PLL, is considered. Analytical results based on average modelling and simulations based on both average and switching models are presented, showing good accuracy in the identification of the stability thresholds for both the proposed methods...|$|R
50|$|The WCAM-1 {{does not}} use a {{variable}} ratio auto-transformer in <b>AC</b> <b>mode</b> like the others; it uses a fixed-ratio transformer and rectifier bank to convert the OHE supply to 1500VDC. The design of the transformers and notches makes this a hard machine to operate, with the fusible links tending to blow often. Of the 28 notches, notches 4, 14, 21, and 28 {{can be used for}} continuous operation, although notch 4 was intended for low-speed shunting and is very ineffective. Notches 14, 21, and 28 are the terminal notches of the series, series-parallel, and parallel circuit notch sequences. In DC mode, the WCAM-1 uses resistor banks for speed control.|$|E

They have 750 V DC traction motors, using resistance banks in DC mode and a variable ratio auto-transformer with rectifier units in <b>AC</b> <b>mode,</b> for power control. The WCAM class locomotives were in service only in the Mumbai region. The dual-voltage WCAM series locomotives hauled intercity trains out of Mumbai DC suburban region which was on a 1500 V DC overhead system, as opposed {{to other parts of}} India which have 25000 V AC overhead.|$|E
50|$|For contact {{potential}} measurements a lock-in amplifier {{is used to}} detect the cantilever oscillation at ω. During the scan VDC will be adjusted so that the electrostatic forces between the tip and the sample become zero and thus the response at the frequency ω becomes zero. Since the electrostatic force at ω depends on VDC − VCPD, the value of VDC that minimizes the ω-term corresponds to the {{contact potential}}. Absolute values of the sample work function can be obtained if the tip is first calibrated against a reference sample of known work function. Apart from this, one can use the normal topographic scan methods at the resonance frequency ω independently of the above. Thus, in one scan, the topography and the contact potential of the sample are determined simultaneously.This {{can be done in}} (at least) two different ways: 1) The topography is captured in <b>AC</b> <b>mode</b> which means that the cantilever is driven by a piezo at its resonant frequency. Simultaneously the AC voltage for the KPFM measurement is applied at a frequency slightly lower than the resonant frequency of the cantilever. In this measurement mode the topography and the contact potential difference are captured {{at the same time and}} this mode is often called single-pass. 2) One line of the topography is captured either in contact or <b>AC</b> <b>mode</b> and is stored internally. Then, this line is scanned again, while the cantilever remains on a defined distance to the sample without a mechanically driven oscillation but the AC voltage of the KPFM measurement is applied and the contact potential is captured as explained above. It is important to note that the cantilever tip must not be too close to the sample in order to allow good oscillation with applied AC voltage. Therefore, KPFM can be performed simultaneously during AC topography measurements but not during contact topography measurements.|$|E

40|$|Discussed in {{the present}} study are details of the {{behavior}} of low-frequency "acoustic" (<b>ac)</b> <b>modes</b> in the spectrum of edge magnetoplasma oscillations in axially symmetric degenerate 2 D electron systems where electron density distribution n(r⃗) behaves as n(r⃗→ R) → 0 when r approaches the external radius R of the domain occupied by electrons. It is shown that finding the dependence of the spectrum of ac-modes on radial (l) and azimuthal (m) indices when both l and m are small requires axially symmetric solution of the relevant problem. The desires is achieved in the so-called elliptic approximation for electron density distribution n(r⃗). The obtained results are employed to interpret available data on the excitation of ac-modes in degenerate electron disks with smooth electron density profile placed in the magnetic field H normal to the disk plane. The performed analysis confirms reported detection of the soft ac-mode in the range of H ≫ H_max where H_max is the field at which the maximum of the ω_lm^s(H) curve is observed (here and below ω_lm^s(H) stands for the frequency of the soft ac-mode). A strong interaction of the ac-modes with (integer) -channels inevitably arising near the boundaries of 2 D electron systems with smooth electron density profile as the magnetic field is varied in the Quantum Hall Effect (QHE) regime is emphasized. Well-formed integer-stripes can suppress some acoustic modes which is actually observed in experiments...|$|R

They were also the first locomotives allotted to Valsad (BL) shed.They are now the most low-horse powered surviving electric locomotives under AC in the country along with WAM-4. Their top speed under DC is also the lowest compared to other Bi-current charged locomotives. They were the first Bi-current charged locomotives in the country.Initially all were vacuum braked but were retrofitted with air brakes to make them dual braked. Some also had there vacuum brakes replaced with air brakes. Due to the reduction of DC territory in Mumbai, some locomotives had their DC equipment removed at the shed. Now these locomotives only run under AC territory. They are soon to be decommissioned.|$|E
