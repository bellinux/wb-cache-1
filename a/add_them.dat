5|$|Alternatively dsRNA can be {{supplied}} without genetic engineering. One {{approach is to}} <b>add</b> <b>them</b> to irrigation water. The molecules are absorbed into the plants' vascular system and poison insects feeding on them. Another approach involves spraying dsRNA like a conventional pesticide. This would allow faster adaptation to resistance. Such approaches would require low cost sources of dsRNAs that do not currently exist.|$|E
5|$|The {{entirety}} of Pacific City may be explored {{from the start}} of the game, allowing the player to locate the hideouts of each General and Kingpin, which can be made easier by accessing supply points scattered around the city. Once a supply point is unlocked, the player has the option of returning there to travel to any other supply point, restock on weapons and ammunition, or drop off newly acquired weapons, to permanently <b>add</b> <b>them</b> to their weapon selection. Should the player die, they can respawn at any open supply point. While exploring, the player is likely to come across enemy resistance, with their aggressiveness based on how badly the player has damaged that particular gang recently. If the player is too aggressive against the non-gang residents of Pacific City, including the Peacekeepers, they are flagged as rogue, and Agency hit squads are dispatched to take them down.|$|E
5|$|Kyle, Cartman and Kenny {{surprise}} Stan {{by creating}} a Facebook account for him. Stan protests, but is quickly pressured by family and friends to <b>add</b> <b>them</b> as friends. To his annoyance and frustration, Stan finds people such as Randy, his grandmother and even Wendy confronting him over his supposed disregard for them and judging his real-world friendship solely by his Facebook configuration. Meanwhile, Kyle adds shy nerdy student Kip Drordy (anagram: Dorky Drip) to his thriving friends list out of pity. Kyle's number of Facebook friends rapidly declines when he does this, {{in part due to}} a Mad Friends podcast he finds Cartman has set up in which he berates Kyle for choosing a loser as a friend and asserts nobody will want to hang out with Kyle. Kyle understands this, but, on principle and out of pity, cannot bring himself to delete Kip to please others. Desperate to stem the loss of friends, he asks Cartman for advice. Cartman introduces Kyle to Chatroulette as a way to make new friends, which fails as most {{of the people on the}} site are either jacking off or showing their genitals, until Cartman finally finds another Jewish kid named Isiah, who agrees to be Kyle's friend, much to Kyle's delight.|$|E

5|$|Once the {{operation}} is complete, Heiter attempts to train his centipede as a pet, often belittling Katsuro with racist insults and beating him with a crop when he becomes rebellious. When Katsuro defecates, Lindsay is forced to swallow his excrement while the doctor watches in delight. However, he eventually becomes irritated after being kept awake by the constant screaming of Katsuro (who, as the front part of the centipede, has his mouth free and is still able to speak) and the realization that Jenny is dying from septicemia. When two detectives, Kranz (Andreas Leupold) and Voller (Peter Blankenstein), visit the house to investigate the disappearance of tourists, Heiter comes {{up with an idea}} to <b>add</b> <b>them</b> as replacements for Jenny in a new creation; a four-segment centipede. He offers the two detectives water spiked with sedatives in hopes of knocking the two unconscious. After being given the water, the detectives become suspicious and obtain a search warrant for his home. While the detectives leave Heiter's home, the victims attempt to escape. Katsuro attacks Heiter in the process. Their attempt to escape ultimately fails. Katsuro confesses to the doctor that he deserves his fate because he had treated his own family poorly, then commits suicide by slitting his throat with a glass shard.|$|E

In truth, the distribution will be Irwin–Hall, which is a 12-section eleventh-order polynomial approximation to the normal distribution. This random deviate will have a limited range of (−6,6).|$|E

SATSair subsequently ceased operations on 24 October 2009, prior to taking delivery of any SF50s.

25|$|The Earth's average surface {{absolute}} temperature for the 1961–1990 period has been derived by spatial interpolation of average observed near-surface air temperatures from over the land, oceans and sea ice regions, with a best estimate of 14°C (57.2°F). The estimate is uncertain, but probably lies within 0.5°C {{of the true}} value. Given the difference in uncertainties between this absolute value and any annual anomaly, it's not valid to <b>add</b> <b>them</b> together to imply a precise absolute value for a specific year.|$|E

25|$|These are {{equivalent}} to the Gell-Mann matrices.

There is no way to add any combination of these states to produce any other, and it is also impossible to <b>add</b> <b>them</b> to make r, g, or b the forbidden singlet state. There are many other possible choices, but all are mathematically equivalent, at least equally complicated, and give the same physical results.|$|E
25|$|If a spyware {{program is}} not blocked and manages to get itself installed, it may resist {{attempts}} to terminate or uninstall it. Some programs work in pairs: when an anti-spyware scanner (or the user) terminates one running process, the other one respawns the killed program. Likewise, some spyware will detect attempts to remove registry keys and immediately <b>add</b> <b>them</b> again. Usually, booting the infected computer in safe mode allows an anti-spyware program {{a better chance of}} removing persistent spyware. Killing the process tree may also work.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} Enterprise {{was not the}} same as that planned for , the first flight model; the aft {{fuselage}} was constructed differently, and it did not have the interfaces to mount OMS pods. A large number of subsystems—ranging from main engines to radar equipment—were not installed on Enterprise, but the capacity to <b>add</b> <b>them</b> in the future was retained, as NASA originally intended to refit the orbiter for spaceflight at the conclusion of its testing. Instead of a thermal protection system, its surface was primarily covered with simulated tiles made from polyurethane foam. Fiberglass was used for the leading edge panels in place of the reinforced carbon–carbon ones of spaceflight-worthy orbiters. Only a few sample thermal tiles and some Nomex blankets were real. Enterprise used fuel cells to generate its electrical power, but these were not sufficient to power the orbiter for spaceflight.|$|E
25|$|Abagnale's early {{confidence}} tricks included writing personal cheque {{on his own}} overdrawn account. This, however, {{would only}} work for a limited time before the bank demanded payment, so {{he moved on to}} opening other accounts at different banks, eventually creating new identities to sustain this charade. Over time through experimentation, he developed different ways of defrauding banks, such as printing out his own almost-perfect copies of checks such as payroll checks, depositing them, and encouraging banks to advance him cash {{on the basis of his}} account balances. Another trick he used was to magnetically print his account number on blank deposit slips and <b>add</b> <b>them</b> to the stack of real blank slips in the bank. This meant that the deposits written on those slips by bank customers entered his account rather than the accounts of the legitimate customers.|$|E
25|$|The Qbot is a {{handheld}} device which park guests can rent for the day. On the device, users can select an amusement ride {{they wish to}} queue for and the device will <b>add</b> <b>them</b> to a virtual queue. The Qbot device will notify users once their virtual queue time has elapsed through vibration and beeping. In 2011, the Qband was introduced for use at water parks. The device, which is similar in size and shape to a watch, functions similarly to the Qbot. Currently the Qband is used at waterparks around the world including: Six Flags Hurricane Harbor, Splish Splash, Wet'nWild Sydney, Raging Waters San Dimas. The Qsmart requires users to have a smartphone which they can use to join virtual queues in a similar method to the Qbot. It replaced the Q-txt product which allowed any mobile phone to register a spot in virtual queues.|$|E
