5|$|Gandhi's arrest lasted two years, as he {{was held}} in the Aga Khan Palace in Pune. During this period, his long time {{secretary}} Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack, his wife Kasturba died after 18 months' imprisonment on 22 February 1944; and Gandhi suffered a severe malaria attack. While in Jail, he agreed to an interview with Stuart Gelder, a British journalist. Gelder then composed and released an interview summary, cabled it to the mainstream press, that announced sudden concessions Gandhi was willing to make, comments that shocked his countrymen, the Congress workers and even Gandhi. The latter two claimed that it distorted what Gandhi <b>actually</b> <b>said</b> on a range of topics and falsely repudiated the Quit India movement.|$|E
5|$|In Waters v. Churchill (1994), the Court {{was faced}} with two differing {{accounts}} of the speech at issue. The question presented to the Court was whether the Connick test ought be applied to what the employer thought was said or what was <b>actually</b> <b>said.</b> The case revolved around a nurse dismissed for a conversation she had with a coworker. There was a discrepancy between what she argued was said and what her employer thought was said. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, joined by a plurality of justices, opined that the Connick test must {{be applied to the}} speech the employer thought occurred, and on which it acted, rather than that which the finder of fact determines did occur.|$|E
5|$|In July 1095, Urban {{turned to}} his {{homeland}} of France to recruit men for the expedition. His travels there culminated in the Council of Clermont in November, where, according to the various speeches attributed to him, he gave an impassioned sermon to a large audience of French nobles and clergy, graphically detailing the fantastical atrocities being committed against pilgrims and eastern Christians. There are five versions of the speech recorded by {{people who may have}} been at the council (Baldric of Dol, Guibert of Nogent, Robert the Monk, and Fulcher of Chartres) or who went on crusade (Fulcher and the anonymous author of the Gesta Francorum), as well as other versions found in later historians (such as William of Malmesbury and William of Tyre). All of these versions were written after Jerusalem had been captured. Thus {{it is difficult to know}} what was <b>actually</b> <b>said</b> and what was recreated in the aftermath of the successful crusade. The only contemporary records are a few letters written by Urban in 1095.|$|E

25|$|In October 2004, {{during an}} 18-night stint at London's Hammersmith Apollo, Connolly was criticised for making {{jokes about the}} hostage Kenneth Bigley. Shortly after Connolly joked about the future killing of the hostage and touched {{on the subject of}} Bigley's young Thai wife, Bigley was {{beheaded}} in Iraq. Connolly claims he was misquoted. He has declined to clarify what he <b>actually</b> <b>said,</b> claiming that the context was as important as the precise words used.|$|E
25|$|The {{encounter}} {{is often}} {{known as the}} Huxley–Wilberforce debate or the Wilberforce–Huxley debate, although this description is somewhat misleading. Rather than being a formal debate between the two, it was actually an animated discussion that occurred after the presentation of a paper by John William Draper of New York University, on the intellectual development of Europe with relation to Darwin's theory (one {{of a number of}} scientific papers presented during the week as part of the British Association's annual meeting). Although Huxley and Wilberforce were not the only participants in the discussion, they were reported to be the two dominant parties. No verbatim account of the debate exists, and there is considerable uncertainty regarding what Huxley and Wilberforce <b>actually</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E
25|$|Waters v. Churchill, 511 U.S. 661 (1994), is a United States Supreme Court case {{concerning}} the First Amendment rights of public {{employees in the}} workplace. By a 7–2 margin the justices held {{that it was not}} necessary to determine what a nurse at a public hospital had <b>actually</b> <b>said</b> while criticizing a supervisor's staffing practices to coworkers, as long as the hospital had formed a reasonable belief as to the content of her remarks and reasonably believed that they could be disruptive to its operations. They vacated a Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in her favor, and ordered the case remanded to district court to determine instead if the nurse had been fired for the speech or other reasons, per the Court's ruling two decades prior in Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle.|$|E

25|$|The summer 2006 {{off-season}} {{marked a}} turbulent time as club president elections were held. Ramón Calderón became the new Real president. As expected, {{none of the}} club officials that served under the previous president were kept, including head coach López Caro. Initially out of favour with newly arrived head coach Fabio Capello, Beckham started only a few games {{at the beginning of}} the season, as the speedier José Antonio Reyes was normally preferred on the right wing. In the first nine matches Beckham started, Real lost seven. On 10 January 2007, after prolonged contract negotiations, Real Madrid's sporting director Predrag Mijatović announced that Beckham would not remain at Real Madrid after the end of the season. However, he later claimed that he was mistranslated and that he <b>actually</b> <b>said</b> that Beckham's contract had not yet been renewed.|$|E
25|$|The League {{concerned}} {{itself with}} the issue of active believers who had infiltrated its own membership and who were trying to prove their loyalty to the regime or even undermine the antireligious work of the League. League members who suspected each other of harbouring religious beliefs secretly discussed their concerns in the early years. The League also had {{to address the issue of}} atheists in its membership who may have sympathized with the religious believers and who may have had doubts about what they were doing. In answer to these, the League adopted a policy that any League member who entered a church (to conduct antireligious work by checking on the strength of believers or numbering them) had to first receive local branch approval beforehand in order so that he did not give the impression that he was going to the church to pray. In contrast the League in Tashkent actually tried to translate the Quran into Uzbek so that more Muslims could read it, in hope that when Muslims were able to read what the Quran <b>actually</b> <b>said,</b> they would reject its content as fallacious.|$|E
25|$|Further reason {{cited by}} Both Fay and Lebra and other authors {{indicate}} monetary and situational scopes, {{as well as}} the resentment at the abandonment of the Indian troops at Singapore by their White comrades and the officers. Controversy exists as to what was <b>actually</b> <b>said</b> by Col J.C. Hunt in the first of the three speeches during the surrender ceremony for the Indian troops at Farrer Park on 17 February 1942. Fay writes in 1993 that a number of the troops gathered at the park remembers Hunt as having told the troops that they now belonged to the Japanese army and should obey their orders while Hunt only remembers having said that they were all Prisoners of War of the Japanese Nevertheless, Fay also points out that {{the fact that they were}} all POWs was already self-evident, and the fact that they were addressed separately implies some significance. A number of INA veterans present at the ceremony have said that, for the Indian troops, this also fed a feeling of devaluation (handed over like cattle, as Shah Nawaz Khan later put it), abandonment and of dishonour on part of the British high command that they perceived to have served loyalty.|$|E

500|$|In {{his opening}} scene, Cagney spoke fluent Yiddish, a {{language}} {{he had picked}} up during his boyhood in New York City. Critics praised the film.

Penrod examined significant differences in two early handwritten accounts of the prophecy, noted some words and phrases which were not characteristic of Joseph Smith's speaking style or current in his time, and speculated that Rushton had [...] "in his elderly years recorded some things that [...] <b>actually</b> <b>said,</b> mixing in words of his own creation"—commenting additionally that [...] "memories of words and events, especially many years later, are often faulty." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite these criticisms, {{the novel}} still {{captured}} {{the imagination of}} many Americans. According to Stowe's son, when Abraham Lincoln met her in 1862 Lincoln commented, [...] "So this is the little lady who started this great war." [...] Historians are undecided if Lincoln <b>actually</b> <b>said</b> this line, and in a letter that Stowe wrote to her husband a few hours after meeting with Lincoln no mention of this comment was made. Since then, many writers have credited this novel with focusing Northern anger at the injustices of slavery and the Fugitive Slave Law and helping to fuel the abolitionist movement. Union general and politician James Baird Weaver said that the book convinced him to become active in the abolitionist movement.|$|E
500|$|According to Pattie Boyd's {{recollection}} in 2007, {{her marriage}} to George Harrison was already [...] "in trouble" [...] {{by the time he}} wrote his 1969 hit song [...] "Something", dedicated to her. Harrison and Boyd were married in January 1966, having met two years before on the set of the Beatles' film A Hard Day's Night, but by 1968, his dedication to meditation and Eastern mysticism had begun to divide the couple. Boyd writes of an associated issue at this time: [...] "And there were other women... George was fascinated by the god Krishna who was always surrounded by young maidens. He came back from India [...] wanting {{to be some kind of}} Krishna figure, a spiritual being with lots of concubines. He <b>actually</b> <b>said</b> so." ...|$|E
500|$|Almost {{everything}} that {{is known about the}} trials comes from a report of the proceedings written by Thomas Potts, the clerk to the Lancaster Assizes. Potts was instructed to write his account by the trial judges, and had completed the work by 16November 1612. Bromley revised and corrected the manuscript before its publication in 1613, declaring it to be [...] "truly reported" [...] and [...] "fit and worthie to be published". Although written as an apparently verbatim account, the book is not a report of what was <b>actually</b> <b>said</b> at the trial, but instead a reflection on what happened. Nevertheless, Potts [...] "seems to give a generally trustworthy, although not comprehensive, account of an Assize witchcraft trial, provided that the reader is constantly aware of his use of written material instead of verbatim reports".|$|E

500|$|Jackson met 15-year-old actress/model Brooke Shields in 1981, at the Academy Awards. From there, {{the pair}} enjoyed a close relationship. Speaking in 2009, she {{reflected}} {{that they were}} close because sex was never an issue for them. Although the headlines in the media referred to Shields' talking about an [...] "asexual Jackson" [...] after his death, what she <b>actually</b> <b>said</b> was, “As he grew older and the more he started to change physically, the more asexual he became to me.” She also said that as she grew up and started having boyfriends, she would confide in him about her intimate experiences, as he was curious.

500|$|Frank Marshall remarked, [...] "In today's {{information}} age, secrecy {{has been}} a real challenge. ... People <b>actually</b> <b>said,</b> 'No, we're going to respect Steven's vision.'" [...] Prior to release, moviegoers on the Internet scrutinized numerous photos and the film's promotional LEGO sets in hope of understanding plot details; Spielberg biographer Ian Freer wrote, [...] "What Indy IV is actually about has been the great cultural guessing game of 2007/08. Yet, it has to be said, there is something refreshing about being ten weeks away from a giant blockbuster and knowing next to nothing about it." [...] To distract investigative fans from the film's title during filming, five fake titles were registered with the Motion Picture Association of America; The City of Gods, The Destroyer of Worlds, The Fourth Corner of the Earth, The Lost City of Gold and The Quest for the Covenant. Lucas and Spielberg had also wanted to keep Karen Allen's return a secret until the film's release, but decided to confirm it at the 2007 Comic-Con.|$|E
