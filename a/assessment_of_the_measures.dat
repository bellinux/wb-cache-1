40|$|By {{agreeing to}} strive for ‘a {{significant}} reduction in {{the current rate of}} loss of biological diversity’ by the year 2010, political leaders at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (held in Johannesburg, South Africa) presented conservation scientists with a great opportunity, but also one of their most significant challenges. This is an extremely exciting and laudable development, but this reporting process could be made yet more powerful if it incorporates, from the outset, independent scientific <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measures,</b> how they are analysed, and practical ways of plugging key gaps. This input is crucial if the measures are to be widely owned, credible and robust to the vigorous external scrutiny to which they will doubtless be exposed.

Furthermore, the best data on which to base estimates of biodiversity loss are biased towards the charismatic vertebrate species; unfortunately, these supply minimal services to the human economy. We have to find ways to redress this taxonomic imbalance and expand our analyses to consider the vast diversity of invertebrate, fungal and microbial species that play a role in determining human health and economic welfare...|$|E
40|$|The {{release of}} the new WHO {{guidelines}} on HIV and infant feeding, in a global context of widespread impoverishment, requires countries to re-examine their infant-feeding policies in relation to broader socioeconomic issues. This widening scope is necessitated by compelling new reports {{on the scale of}} global underdevelopment in developing countries. This paper explores these issues by addressing feeding choices made by HIV-infected mothers and programmes supplying free formula milks within a global environment of persistent poverty. Accumulating evidence on the increase in malnutrition, morbidity and mortality associated with the avoidance or early cessation of breastfeeding by HIV-infected mothers, and the unanticipated hazards of formula feeding, demand a deeper <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> necessary for optimum policies on infant and child nutrition and for the amelioration of poverty. Piecemeal interventions that increase resources directed at only a fraction of a family’s impoverishment, such as basic materials for preparation of hygienic formula feeds and making flawed decisions on choice of infant feeding, are bound to fail. These are not alternatives to taking fundamental steps to alleviate poverty. The economic opportunity costs of such programmes, the equity costs of providing resources to some and not others, and the leakages due to temptation to sell capital goods require careful evaluation. Providing formula to poor populations with high HIV prevalence cannot be justified by the evidence, by humanitarian considerations, by respect for local traditions or by economic outcomes. Exclusive breastfeeding, which is threatened by the HIV epidemic, remains an unfailing anchor of child survival...|$|E
30|$|The RESTRAIL {{literature}} review highlighted the main differences and similarities between railway suicides and trespassing events and discussed the preventive measures [14]. These measures {{can be applied}} to both events or be specifically targeted to prevent either railway suicides or trespassing accidents [14]. According to a survey among RESTRAIL partners more than 40 different (partly overlapping) measures for the prevention of railway suicides and trespassing accidents have been implemented in EU Member States. Furthermore, several ideas on possible new measures were collected. The reported implemented measures concerned especially social measures targeting suicides (e.g. national and local prevention programmes, media guidelines on suicide reporting), but also different kinds of behavioural measures (e.g. posters, information campaigns and education at schools), physical measures (e.g. fencing and landscaping) and technological measures (e.g. video surveillance). In parallel with this RESTRAIL work, the US Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) published a report on counter measures to mitigate railway suicide [15] and Mineta Transportation Institute (MTI) a report on actions to prevent suicide on commuter and rail systems [16]. These reports are complementary with the RESTRAIL review [14] discussing the same categories of interventions. They show that parallel work conducted on another continent lead to convergent results. In addition, they point to the same overall conclusion highlighted by RESTRAIL: the data on the effectiveness of measures are almost non-existent and the need of evaluation work is imminent. In this context, the added value of the RESTRAIL project is that it also provided: (a) an international expert <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> in order to filter the most promising ones (discussed in chapter 3) and (b) the specific evaluation of some measures on the field (discussed in chapter 5).|$|E

The first {{coastline}} of the Valencian region, {{is one of}} {{the more}} transformed around the Mediterranean areas. One of each two km is urbanized at the beginning of 21 st century. The driving force behind this transformation for decades has been the tourist immigration, and specifically the real estate business linked to the second residence. Between 2004 and 2006, at the peak of the Spanish housing bubble, in this region were awarded licenses for 315 thousand new housing construction, as well as the ways of communication and tourist infrastructures linked to the phenomenon of urban expansion. In this context appeared some legal measures to contain the spatial and demographic growth that threatens the coastline. The new regional laws of urban and regional planning introduced thresholds to urban expansion and established a quota of sustainability to curb urbanization euphoria of many municipalities. But since 2007, paradoxically the capitalist crisis had hampered urban growth. In the opposite direction, the Valencian Government has suppressed the containment measures and has issued new laws to reactivate the real state and the tourist-tertiary complexes construction. These are measures that propose more bricks against the crisis of the brick. We carry out an <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> of the Valencian Government and propose a change of model, through the techniques and tools that it includes urban and territorial planning.

40|$|At a {{time when}} {{environmental}} mitigation is firmly at {{the centre of the}} agenda for sustainable development, {{there is no shortage of}} research in the field of green logistics. However, little has been done in an attempt to provide integrated solutions for industry, based on a practical assessment of the interrelationships between specific measures. This research investigates the current status of the British logistics industry in terms of its environmental sustainability, by examining 14 sustainable measures that feature strongly in contemporary logistics practice and policies, and determines the interrelationships among them. The primary data was collected using a combined approach involving a postal questionnaire survey and in-depth company interviews. The survey covered both logistics services providers (LSPs) and logistics service users (LSUs), together with the targeted inclusion of more specific actors within the logistics industry. Through analysis of the sustainable practice and implementation process as seen in the experiences and judgments of key actors in the logistics industry, it is shown that the role of the actors as either logistics providers or users has a certain impact on their perceptions of, and behaviours in, sustainable logistics. Particular characteristics of the company and the sector it belongs to also exert influence, to various extents, on its response to sustainability. The findings also highlight cost-effectiveness as another critical factor determining companies’ sustainability policies. On the basis of the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measures,</b> in particular their effectiveness and cost efficiency, the thesis concludes with proposals for sustainable packages constructed from different perspectives, along with suggestions for their implementation. This evidence-based research thus informs policy-makers of appropriate and viable sustainable strategies with the right incentives in various circumstances, and the potential to bring about tangible improvements in environmental performance...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} centred {{on the problem}} of child labour in the urban areas of Zambia. The origins, types and context of child labour are {{extensively}} described as are the incidence and distribution of the problem by locality, trade and activity. The very definition of 'child labour' is uncertain with legal, historical, comparative, customary and academic definitions being somewhat contradictory. The differing notions are considered and reconciled. As child labour is mainly concentrated in the 'informal sector', the nature of this sector in Zambia and other poor countries is analysed. The limited opportunities for education, employment and productive and fulfilling self-employment in the informal sector are highlighted. An account of the historical origins and development of child labour in the pre-colonial and colonial periods is provided. An <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> designed to control or ameliorate child labour follows. This covers the work of international organisations, the colonial and post-colonial governments in Zambia, the voluntary sector and concerned individuals. The effectiveness and coverage of the relevant international conventions and local legal provisions and enforcement are evaluated. The consequences on child labour of more recent interventions by international agencies, for example the Structural Adjustment Program of the World Bank, are illustrated. Three main forms of analysis have been used in this thesis. First a descriptive account of child labour has been supplied using secondary accounts and unpublished reports. Second, the author has undertaken a comparative analysis, examining child labour in two other African countries as well as two countries in each of the continents of Asia and Latin America. Third, extensive interviews with child labourers themselves and those who are close to their plight have been undertaken, to provide the actor's own graphic and personal views on the issues discussed. The thesis concludes with an appraisal of the significance of the study, general prescriptive comments and some more specific policy recommendations designed to address and combat the incidence and worst features of child labour in Zambia...|$|E

40|$|Background. Preliminary {{qualitative}} research suggests some college students believe sexual consent can be communicated and interpreted in Social settings, such as parties or bars, and in contexts lacking face-to-face interaction like text messages and Social media content. Previous sexual consent researchers have described perceptions of consent {{that occur in}} Social settings as “outside the bedroom” consent. The belief that sexual consent can be interpreted from Social media content or that accepting an alcoholic beverage from someone at a bar is indicative of sexual consent is problematic and warrants further study. Current validated consent scales are limited and do not assess perceptions or beliefs regarding “outside the bedroom” consent as they primarily focus on consent that occurs in the moments right before sexual behavior occurs. Purpose. Thus, {{the purpose of the}} current study was to develop and psychometrically assess two sexual consent scales that measure consent beliefs and consent perceptions respectively. The Social Media Consent Myths Scale (SMCMS) and the External Consent Scale – Revised (ECSR) were rigorously developed utilizing a multi-phase research design consisting of a mixed methods approach with three phases of data collection. Methods. In Phase 1, college students (N= 104) pilot-tested both measures, with a subset of students (n= 10) recruited to provide qualitative feedback via focus groups. Phase 2 (N= 75) comprised additional item refinement for both measures. Phase 3 (N= 695) constituted psychometric <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> via reliability and validity analyses. Results. Results provide support for the validity and reliability of both newly developed scales. The SMCMS measures endorsement of the belief that consent can be derived based on a person’s Social media content. The ECSR measures how a person communicated their consent during their most recent consensual sexual experience. Conclusions. Both the SMCMS and ECSR are valid tools {{that can be used to}} assess college students’ beliefs and perceptions regarding consent in an effort to create sexual assault prevention education (SAPE) programs that are culturally relevant to students and address common false beliefs regarding consent. Additionally, these measures could be utilized as evaluative mechanisms to assess whether SAPE programs successfully change students’ consent beliefs and behaviors...|$|E

Accurate case ascertainment devices are the basis of sound epidemiology. Without these, neither case classification nor analytic studies of risk factors is possible. ^ The purpose of this research was to examine {{the reliability and validity of}} an instrument designed to measure depressive symptoms in community populations [...] the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D Scale). Two particular foci of the study were whether or not the scale had the same statistical structure across three ethnic groups and whether or not the magnitude and pattern of rates of symptoms for these groups were affected by one source of response error, that due to response tendencies. The effects of age and education on the pattern and magnitude of rates also were examined. In addition, the reliability and validity of the measures of response tendencies were assessed. ^ The study population consisted of residents of Alameda County, California. A stratified sample of approximately 700 whites, blacks and Mexican-Americans was interviewed in the summer and fall of 1978. ^ The results of the analysis indicated that the scale was reliable and measured a similar content domain across the three ethnic groups. The unadjusted sex- and ethnic-specific rates of depressive symptoms showed an ethnic pattern for both sexes: rates for whites were lowest, those for Mexican-Americans were highest, and those for blacks were intermediate. Measures of response tendencies [...] need for social approval, trait desirability, and acquiescence [...] affected the magnitude of the rates for most comparisons. Likewise, the pattern of rates changed somewhat from that originally observed. The one fairly consistent observation was that rates for Mexican-American women were higher than those for the other two female subgroups in most of the comparisons. These results must be considered in the context of the reliability and validity <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> of response tendencies which indicated the tenuousness of these measures. ^ Age affected the ethnic pattern of rates for men in an inconsistent way; for women, Mexican-Americans continued to have higher rates than whites or blacks in all age categories. Education affected the magnitude of rates for women but not for men. For both men and women, Mexican-Americans had higher rates in all educational strata.

The use of numerical models, at different spatial scales, to describe the physical and chemical processes affecting the atmosphere and the ocean is at the hearth of the history and activities of the research groups involved. Nevertheless, great effort and commitment was also dedicated {{to the development of}} integrated models to explore links and feedback between the different aspects of the same system. These unique platforms called IAM (Integrated Assessment Modelling) help and support policy-makers to develop and promote sustainable policies. With this vision we have been developing the national model MINNI (Integrated National Model in support to the International Negotiation on Air Pollution) since 2003. It includes the Integrated Assessment Model GAINS-Italia, which helped our Country: to negotiate revisions of European and International Directives and Protocols with technical data and national scenario simulations; to support technically the actions needed to deal with European infringement procedures; to help the Regional Authorities to fully understand and use the measurements until they have become totally autonomous; to support the early season of the Air Quality Regional Plans together with the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measures</b> identified in them. A parallel and equally far-sighted vision has been offered by our colleagues of the actual Division who have been dealing for years with the “pollution effects”. They hold significant roles within the International Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) both as national representatives in the Executive Body and National Focal Point or Experts within technical Task Forces. To date a lot of work has been done but we need more and more of each other’s expertize to move forward in the complexity. We cannot have disciplinary “exclusivity” because atmospheric pollution and its effects are no longer (and have never been) a single discipline theme. At the same time we must avoid that integration could generate only simplification. The main intent of this publication and of this day is to take stock of the situation in Italy, sharing what has been done both on the atmospheric pollution and effects side as well as the many and important experiences of comparison and integration. We would like to start from here {{in order to deal with}} what Europe strongly advocates: that the definition of policies to face air pollution considers as a priority the reduction of its effects...|$|E
30|$|Although Partial Least Square (PLS) {{estimates}} {{parameters for}} both <b>the</b> links between <b>measures</b> and constructs (i.e., loadings) and {{the links between}} different constructs (i.e., path coefficients) at the same time, a PLS model is usually analyzed and interpreted sequentially in two stages as follows: (1) an <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reliability and validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> measurement model, followed by (2) an <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structural model and (3) an <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overall <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{implementation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Global Positioning Systems (GPS) in {{the surveillance}} and monitoring of offenders by public institutions has grown exponentially since 2005. His presence appears {{related to the}} social alarm in the public opinion caused by certain crimes (Peckenpaugh, 2006) and, at the same time, to <b>the</b> need <b>of</b> containing dangerous and serious offenders, as well as technological advances that innovate new forms of crime control, reformulating sentences and traditional measures. Spanish GPS technology began to be implemented in 2009 to control offenders who serve a restraining order in cases of gender violence. After seven years from this pilot experience there is no research that estimates their impacts and challenges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measure.</b> This paper examines the systems implementation during {{the first four years}} in order to determine their impacts and effectiveness. To this end it has applied a qualitative methodology based on in-depth interviews to a representative sample of institutional key actors who manage the restraining order throughout the Spanish territory, that is: police officers, judges, prosecutors, members of private companies, etc. The main results show a positive <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> while many technical problems have been referred.
