5|$|Construction of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> Expressway {{started in}} the summer of 1962. The design was to feature a 300- to 400-foot-wide roadway with 12-foot-wide travel lanes and right {{shoulders}} as well as 3-foot-wide left shoulders. The portion between Route 42 in Turnersville and the Garden State Parkway in Egg Harbor Township was completed on July 31, 1964, and the portion between the Garden State Parkway and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> was finished in July 1965. Construction of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> Expressway cost a total of $48.2 million. Tolls on the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> Expressway initially cost $0.75 at the Egg Harbor toll plaza and $0.15 at the Pleasantville toll plaza. In 1991, the South Jersey Transportation Authority was created by the New Jersey Legislature to operate the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> Expressway, the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> International Airport, and operations of the Atlantic County Transportation Authority.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, many {{improvements}} {{have been}} made to the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> Expressway. A new interchange with County Route 689 on the Gloucester Township/Winslow Township border was completed in 2000 at a cost of $5 million. The Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector was completed on July 31, 2001 to connect the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> Expressway to the Marina district and Brigantine. In 2005, the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> Expressway added a third lane in both directions between the Garden State Parkway and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> and in the eastbound direction between Route 73 and the Garden State Parkway. In addition, the Pleasantville Toll Plaza was reconstructed, replacing the older cash booths with newer technology.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Walt Whitman Bridge in the 1950s, two toll expressways were proposed to connect the bridge to <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> and to Cape May. In 1962, the New Jersey Expressway Authority Act was signed into law. This act created the New Jersey Expressway Authority, which was to manage both the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> and Cape May expressways.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, a spur of Route 4, Route S4A, was {{proposed}} as a route running from Route 4 (now U.S. Route 9) in Tuckerton in Ocean County south to Little Beach. In 1929, this route was to continue south through Brigantine to <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City,</b> with the portion south of Little Beach {{to be built}} by Atlantic County. The state of New Jersey took over the proposed extension of Route S4A from Little Beach to <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> in 1938. However, the portion of this route between Brigantine and the Atlantic/Ocean County line was never built, and the portion of road that existed in Ocean County {{was removed from the}} state highway system by 1941. In 1945, another route called Route S56, a spur of Route 56 (now U.S. Route 30), {{was proposed}} to run north along Brigantine Boulevard (present-day Route 187 and Route 87) from <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> to Brigantine. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 87 was designated as an unsigned route along the former alignment of Route S4A and the proposed Route S56 between U.S. Route 30 in <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> and Brigantine. Following the 1953 renumbering, the southern portion of Route 87 in <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> split into two alignments, with one following Huron Avenue and the other following Brigantine Boulevard. Eventually, the alignment of Route 87 along Brigantine Boulevard between U.S. Route 30 and Huron Avenue became Route 187. In 2001, the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> – Brigantine Connector was completed, linking Route 87, the casinos in the Marina District, and Brigantine with the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> Expressway.|$|E

5|$|Route 87 is a {{state highway}} located in Atlantic County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It runs , heading north from <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> at an {{intersection}} with U.S. Route 30 (Absecon Boulevard) to Brigantine, where it terminates {{at the end of}} the Justice Vincent S. Haneman Memorial Bridge over the Absecon Channel, continuing as County Route 638 (Brigantine Boulevard). In <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City,</b> the route runs through the Marina District, which contains a few casinos, along Huron Avenue and Brigantine Boulevard. Here, Route 87 intersects with Route 187 (Brigantine Boulevard) and the Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector, the latter providing a limited-access route between Route 87 and the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> Expressway. Route 87 is the only road to and from Brigantine.|$|E

5|$|The route {{passes to}} the west of the Golden Nugget casino and comes to a ramp that {{provides}} access from northbound Route 87 to both the Trump Marina and Harrah's <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> casinos before passing under the northbound <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> – Brigantine Connector again. Immediately after, the route has a ramp from the southbound direction that provides access to the connector and westbound U.S. Route 30. The northbound <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> – Brigantine Connector parallels Route 87 to the east as it turns northeast and comes to a right-in/right-out in the southbound direction that serves both Harrah's and Borgata. From here, the route passes to the southeast of Harrah's. The northbound <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> – Brigantine Connector merges onto northbound Route 87 before the route comes to a ramp that provides access to the northbound direction of the route from Harrah's. Past here, the route crosses over the Absecon Channel on the Justice Vincent S. Haneman Memorial Bridge and runs along the border of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> to the northwest and Brigantine to the southeast. After crossing the Absecon Channel, the route arrives on Brigantine Island and passes through wetlands, with U-turn ramps in both directions. A short distance later, Route 87 ends and County Route 638 continues along Brigantine Boulevard through Brigantine.|$|E

5|$|What is now U.S. Route 322 {{east of the}} Route 42 {{junction}} {{was established}} in 1855 as the Black Horse Pike, a turnpike that ran from Camden to <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> via Blackwoodtown. In 1923, the portion of present US 322 along the US 40 concurrency was designated {{as a part of}} pre-1927 Route 18S, a route that was built to connect Penns Grove to <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City.</b> As a result of the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, U.S. Route 40 was also signed along the alignment Route 18S. A year later, in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, the current alignment of US 322 through New Jersey was designated as a part of Route 42 between Williamstown and McKee City, while Route 48 replaced the Route 18S designation along the portion between McKee City and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City.</b> The portion of US 40/US 322 in <b>Atlantic</b> <b>City</b> was legislated as Route 55 in 1938.|$|E

After US 30, the road turns east into wooded neighborhoods, becoming Wyoming Avenue. Route 157 intersects US 9 from the south, with US 9 making {{a left turn}} to head northeast onto Shore Road.

5|$|In the 1980s, Congressman William J.

The Cardiff Circle along US 40/US 322 at CR 563 and CR 608 in Egg Harbor Township was eliminated in a $3.7 million project completed in 2002.|$|E
