40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{database}} is {{a collection}} of data normally describing the activities of one or more organization. In now-a-days database security <b>at</b> <b>various</b> <b>level</b> of designing database is the main issue. It protects recorded data from threats, unauthorized use, data loss, hackers, deletion, replication, false server and unauthorized modification. If the database is complex then more complex the security measures that is to be controlled. Data is more insecure and vulnerable on network and centralized distribution. The possibility of loss of data becomes increase if security measurement is not used <b>at</b> <b>various</b> <b>level</b> of designing and use of data. The paper discusses security of data <b>at</b> <b>various</b> <b>level</b> of its use...|$|R

5|$|The {{revised version}} of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (the WAIS-R) was {{developed}} by David Wechsler and published by Psychological Corporation in 1981.

The test's manual included information about how the actual percentage of persons in the norming sample scoring <b>at</b> <b>various</b> <b>levels</b> compared to theoretical expectations.|$|E

5|$|Weather {{maps are}} used to display {{information}} quickly showing the analysis of various meteorological quantities <b>at</b> <b>various</b> <b>levels</b> of the atmosphere, {{in this case the}} surface layer. Maps containing station models aid in the drawing of isotherms, which more readily identifies temperature gradients, and can help in the location of weather fronts. Two-dimensional streamlines based on wind speeds show areas of convergence and divergence in the wind field, which are helpful in determining the location of features within the wind pattern. A popular type of surface weather map is the surface weather analysis, which plots isobars to depict areas of high pressure and low pressure.|$|E
5|$|A back-building thunderstorm, {{commonly}} referred to as a training thunderstorm, is a thunderstorm in which new development takes place on the upwind side (usually the west or southwest side in the Northern Hemisphere), such that the storm seems to remain stationary or propagate in a backward direction. Though the storm often appears stationary on radar, or even moving upwind, this is an illusion. The storm is really a multi-cell storm with new, more vigorous cells that form on the upwind side, replacing older cells that continue to drift downwind. When this happens, catastrophic flooding is possible. In Rapid City, South Dakota, in 1972, an unusual alignment of winds <b>at</b> <b>various</b> <b>levels</b> of the atmosphere combined to produce a continuously training set of cells that dropped an enormous quantity of rain upon the same area, resulting in devastating flash flooding. A similar event occurred in Boscastle, England, on 16 August 2004.|$|E
5|$|A {{weather map}} {{displays}} various meteorological features across {{a particular area}} at a particular point in time and has various symbols which all have specific meanings. Such maps have been in use since the mid-19th century and are used for research and weather forecasting purposes. Maps using isotherms show temperature gradients, which can help locate weather fronts. Isotach maps, analyzing lines of equal wind speed, on a constant pressure surface of 300 or 250hPa show where the jet stream is located. Use of constant pressure charts at the 700 and 500hPa level can indicate tropical cyclone motion. Two-dimensional streamlines based on wind speeds <b>at</b> <b>various</b> <b>levels</b> show areas of convergence and divergence in the wind field, which are helpful in determining the location of features within the wind pattern. A popular type of surface weather map is the surface weather analysis, which plots isobars to depict areas of high pressure and low pressure. Cloud codes are translated into symbols and plotted on these maps along with other meteorological data that are included in synoptic reports sent by professionally trained observers.|$|E

5|$|After {{retiring}} as a player, Shero {{continued to}} coach {{and began a}} 13-year coaching career in the minor leagues. During {{his time in the}} minors, Shero proved to be a winning coach accumulating six first-place finishes, five second-place finishes and twice finishing third in various leagues. He also coached the St. Paul Saints to the IHL championship, The Turner Cup, in 1960 and 1961. In 1964, he coached the St. Paul Rangers to the CPHL championship finals. The following season Shero began his AHL coaching career with the Buffalo Bisons whom he led to a Calder Cup Championship in 1970, while winning the Louis A. R. Pieri Memorial Award as AHL coach of the year. For the 1970–71 season Shero again changed teams this time coaching in the Central Hockey League with the Omaha Knights, winning the league Championship. Although in the Rangers farm system for several years and winning <b>at</b> <b>various</b> <b>levels,</b> Shero was never seriously considered to replace Emile Francis as head coach, due to Shero's perceived alcohol problem and a belief that he was an ineffective communicator.|$|E
5|$|At local, regional, and {{national}} levels, Bahá'ís elect members to nine-person Spiritual Assemblies, which run {{the affairs of}} the religion. There are also appointed individuals working <b>at</b> <b>various</b> <b>levels,</b> including locally and internationally, which perform the function of propagating the teachings and protecting the community. The latter do not serve as clergy, which the Bahá'í Faith does not have. The Universal House of Justice, first elected in 1963, remains the successor and supreme governing body of the Bahá'í Faith, and its 9 members are elected every five years by the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies. Any male Bahá'í, 21 years or older, is eligible to be elected to the Universal House of Justice; all other positions are open to male and female Bahá'ís.|$|E
