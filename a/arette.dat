Because of this revelation, <b>Bette</b> decides to remove Tina's 'life-partner privileges'. During <b>Bette's</b> retreat, Tina (who has already had an online fling and also a frustrated attempt at fulfilling her interest with a male movie producer) meets Henry Young (Steven Eckholdt), a divorced man with one son. Upon realizing her relationship with <b>Bette</b> may soon reach a dead end, she starts an affair with Henry so as to use her bisexuality to get sole custody of Angelica. <b>Bette</b> and Tina have difficulties with a social worker who is tasked with evaluating their second-parent adoption process, who is both unimpressed with <b>Bette's</b> attitude towards finding another job and sows doubts in Tina about <b>Bette</b> adopting Angelica. As Tina and Henry (who also shows doubts about <b>Bette's</b> parental rights) continue settling in, <b>Bette</b> decides to visit Joyce Wishnea (Jane Lynch), a gay civil rights lawyer Tina had previously contacted for her separation from <b>Bette,</b> in order to obtain the full custody of Angelica. Later on, <b>Bette</b> decides to withdraw her sole custody petition. The notification unfortunately reaches her lawyer too late. After receiving <b>Bette's</b> letter, Tina decides to withdraw her consent for allowing <b>Bette</b> to become Angelica's other legal parent. The season closes with Tina and Henry returning home and discovering Angelica is missing, having been kidnapped by <b>Bette.</b>|$|R
