5|$|Anderson {{explained}} {{that although the}} title of his documentary was Fuck, he allowed alternate designations using an asterisk. The film and content he controlled would refer to the title as Fuck, including theatrical and DVD editions. He concluded that his struggle reflected the debate alluded to by the documentary, and this realization motivated him to stand firm on the film's title. Because the film is about how <b>a</b> <b>taboo</b> word can impact culture, it was important to keep Fuck as its title.|$|E
5|$|The Kingdom of Nri was a religio-polity, {{a sort of}} theocratic state, that {{developed}} in the central heartland of the Igbo region. The Nri had <b>a</b> <b>taboo</b> symbolic code with six types. These included human (such as twins), animal, object, temporal, behavioral, speech and place taboos. The rules regarding these taboos were used to educate and govern Nri's subjects. This meant that, while certain Igbo may have lived under different formal administration, all followers of the Igbo religion had {{to abide by the}} rules of the faith and obey its representative on earth, the eze Nri.|$|E
5|$|The king {{returns to}} his capital and invites his guru Vashishtha to the Ashwamedha sacrifice. The sage accepts. The vengeful rakshasa assumes {{the form of the}} sage and informs the king that he {{secretly}} desires to eat meat (<b>a</b> <b>taboo</b> for sages), and that the king should come to his ashram and offer him meat. Deceived by the rakshasa's disguise, Kalmashapada with his queen goes to Vashishtha's ashram and presents him with meat. The sage feels insulted seeing the taboo offering, and curses the king to be a rakshasa.|$|E

5|$|Erik and Ashley begin dating, but {{on their}} first date at a restaurant, Erik has hot soup spilled accidentally on his legs, so Ashley brings him to her room to clean up. As Ashley rubs lotion on Erik's thigh, he {{develops}} an involuntary erection and accidentally ejaculates over her possessions. Erik apologizes and explains to Ashley that, after breaking up with Tracy, he has not ejaculated in four months, masturbation being <b>a</b> <b>taboo</b> in his house because of a previous incident. Meanwhile, Cooze {{falls in love with}} Ashley's roommate Denise; however, she is nervous about showing her genitalia and having sex with him, so she gives Cooze a handjob instead. After talking with Erik, Bobby, and Dwight about Denise, Cooze develops suspicions that Denise might have a penis, so Dwight encourages him to find out.|$|E
5|$|Sihanaka culture {{traditionally}} {{adhered to}} a wide variety of fady, some of which are still respected to varying degrees by more traditional families to the present day. Many of their fady in the early 1900s were documented by historian Van Gennep. The most absolute fady and the only one that was seemingly practiced by all Sihanaka was a prohibition against working in a paddy field on Tuesdays; sub-groups among the Sihanaka also practiced other taboos associated with particular days of the week, such as not leaving the house or not cleaning floor mats on certain days. A fady was placed on consumption of any new or foreign products, including Western medicines. Another common fady was <b>a</b> <b>taboo</b> against watching the rising or setting of the sun, staring at anything red, or falling asleep at sunset.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} Lightning Returns battle system {{originated}} while ideas were being discussed for the battle system in Final Fantasy XIII, but technical limitations and problems implementing it in a party-based battle system prevented {{it from being}} used in that game. It reemerged {{when some of the}} development team wanted Lightning to change her appearance during battle, and reducing to one playable character opened up the memory space necessary for such a system to be implemented. In making the system revolve around one character, the developers ended up removing any opportunity for story scenes between party members, which was cited by Abe as its main weakness. The time limit sprang from the story concept of a world with a set time to live. When the feature was first announced, there were some who felt it was too new a thing, as a time limit was seen as <b>a</b> <b>taboo</b> in role-playing video games. The mechanic originally received negative feedback from test players who were unable to complete the game in time. In response to this, the team made adjustments so that players were given a more comfortable amount of time. Along with sharing design elements with the previous two XIII games, the system also bears similarities to the battle system of Final Fantasy XV, although the developers said that they were not directly inspired by it.|$|E

25|$|Breast {{cancer has}} been known to educated women and {{caregivers}} throughout history, but modesty and horror at the consequences of a largely untreatable disease made it <b>a</b> <b>taboo</b> subject.

50|$|Rathinirvedam is an incisive {{portrayal}} of a teenager's {{coming to terms with}} his budding libido that eventually drives him into <b>a</b> <b>tabooed</b> bond with <b>an</b> affable spinster in the neighbourhood. A teenage mind caught in the flux of sexual adolescence is captured beautifully through the lens by the director Bharathan. Steamy scenes restrict the movie to mature audiences. In typical Bharathan style, an unexpected climax leaves the audience in tears. Jayabharathi gives a commendable performance as the titular character in this movie.|$|R

The collapse of this taboo in {{the coverage of the}} Martinović case heralded the growth of nationalism that was to lead to the country's collapse in 1991.|$|E

Indeed, the Bois de Boulogne is to this day known as a pick-up place for prostitutes and illicit sexual activity after dark, just as {{it had been in the}} 19th century.|$|E
