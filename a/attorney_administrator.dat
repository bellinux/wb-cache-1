40|$|This study {{examines}} processes of reform in disease {{management in the}} Viceroyalty of New Spain in the eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries. Especially under the enlightened rule of Charles III (1759 - 1788), onerous programs of epidemic management were introduced into communities accustomed to resolving disease in municipalities, villages, barrios, parishes, and homes. The objections of these communities to the interventions of the state led to an early and rapid adjustment in the official policy. In place of disruptive cordons sanitaires and isolation of patients in makeshift infirmaries, the viceregal government turned to immunization, where religious symbols, personnel, rituals, charity, and institutions helped frame modern medicine for lay communities. Bourbon reforms {{in the realm of}} public health ultimately became a reality through a modified "paternalistic" program of medical provision. This program was a natural outcome of centuries of Habsburg rule, in which indigenous villages had been accorded certain legal and fiduciary considerations and deemed especially vulnerable to disease, intemperate reform, and intervention from outsiders. Bourbon innovations in public health of necessity respected these longstanding arrangements or risked failure. The injunction to provide and receive charity in crisis, and the belief that ceremonial performance {{was the best way to}} effect conversions to novel practices such as vaccine, led to a sustained effort to transfer sacred status to the new components of public health policy. As one crown <b>attorney</b> observed, <b>administrators</b> had been reminded by subjects of the obligation to make use of the "sacred ties of civil society" whenever possible. Historical studies of public health have tended to stress innovations in hygiene and urban sanitation in the nineteenth century. This study shows that significant change occurred earlier and actively involved non-state actors in adapting and popularizing medicine at the local level. By considering the numerous sites where medical science, ideology, and techniques were tested and critiqued, it seeks a more adequate view of scientific culture and enlightened medical programs as the product of diverse laypeople, multiple epistemologies, and longstanding colonial practice...|$|R
40|$|Why not set {{the cutoff}} score at 70 percent? That score {{has been used}} as passing {{throughout}} elementary school, junior high school, high school, and college. Most people are familiar with a 70 percent cutoff because of our experiences in the school system. If a score has been used for so long as a standard, why change it? Why challenge it? I have heard judges, <b>administrators,</b> <b>attorneys,</b> and analysts ask these questions. The specific score that is used as the cutoff is what separates those who pass a test from those who do not. It is this score that determines the consequences of taking the test. Those who take a test and do not reach the cutoff score are not considered further for promotion. Or if the test is the conclusion to a training course, by missing the cutoff score, the person may have to take the training again. If the test is for certification, scoring below the cutoff means having to try again for certification. Failing the licensing test means having to wait another six months or a year to take the test again, and, perhaps, not getting a substantial pay increase. The time that an unsuccessful test taker has to wait before taking a test again will vary. Two years is a common time period between test administrations when litigation i...|$|R

The ELC provides ready access to non-partisan information, research and analysis to assist those setting education policy at the local, state and federal levels. The journal, titled the Education Law and Policy Forum, will be a searchable and comprehensive online database of research on law and policy issues in education aimed at scholars, <b>attorneys,</b> students, <b>administrators</b> and faculty at all levels – including K- 12 and higher education. This new resource will stretch {{the boundaries of the}} uses of new media and information technology in research and instruction, according to ELC Co-director Anne Proffitt Dupre, who holds a J. Alton Hosch Professorship at the UGA School of Law. “The Education Law and Policy Forum will enable those interested in education to have immediate access to the latest research findings in the field without the delay that is experienced with traditional journals,” she said. Graduate and professional students from across the nation are invited to submit works for the journal, which will be officially launched in the fall of 2005. The authors of selected papers will also present their work at a conference to be held in Athens in September 2005. ELC members coordinating the project are Dupre; co-director John P. Dayton, a professor at the UGA College of Education, and J. Douglas Toma, a fellow of the ELC and an associate professor at the university’s Institute of Higher Education. UGA’s Committee for Applied Instructional Technologies is funding the Learning Technologies Grant for the Education Law and Policy Forum. This committee awards money for projects that incorporate the innovative use of media and information technology.
