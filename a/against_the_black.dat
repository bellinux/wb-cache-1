5|$|Agents of Repression (1988), co-authored by Jim Vander Wall, {{describes}} what the authors claim {{was a secret}} war <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Panther Party and American Indian Movement carried out during the late 1960s and '70s by the FBI under the COINTELPRO program. The COINTELPRO Papers (1990; reissued 2002), also co-authored with Jim Vander Wall, examines a series of original FBI memos that detail the Bureau's activities against various leftist groups, from the U.S. Communist Party in the 1950s to activists concerned with Central American issues in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In 1495 the Italian Renaissance {{arrived in}} France, {{imported}} by King Charles VIII after his invasion of Italy. A factor that promoted {{the spread of}} secularism was {{the inability of the}} Church to offer assistance <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Death. Francis I imported Italian art and artists, including Leonardo da Vinci, and built ornate palaces at great expense. Writers such as François Rabelais, Pierre de Ronsard, Joachim du Bellay and Michel de Montaigne, painters such as Jean Clouet, and musicians such as Jean Mouton also borrowed from the spirit of the Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|Its two {{drivers are}} a 180mm paper woofer and a 35mm soft-domed tweeter. The woofer's diaphragm, {{weighing}} 3.7g, is manufactured from a flat sheet of pressed pulp paper. Unconventionally, it is formed into conical shape not through moulding or pressure, but by curling and then gluing the two ends together. <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> finish of the cabinet, the white bass/mid driver cone is a distinctive and iconic {{feature of the}} product.|$|E

5000|$|FitzSimons has recounted {{how he was}} {{the only}} Wallaby (up to 2010) to have been sent from the field in a match <b>against</b> <b>the</b> All <b>Blacks.</b> <b>The</b> {{dismissal}} occurred when FitzSimons was playing for an invitational South Australian side <b>against</b> <b>the</b> All <b>Blacks</b> at <b>the</b> Hindmarsh Stadium in Adelaide in 1992. Drew Mitchell was subsequently dismissed while playing for Australia <b>against</b> <b>the</b> All <b>Blacks</b> in 2010.|$|R
5|$|The Canadiens {{missed the}} playoffs entirely in 1969–70, losing the last playoff {{spot in the}} East on a tiebreaker. On {{the last day of}} the season, New York {{defeated}} the Red Wings 9–5, tying Montreal in points and obtaining a five-goal lead on the Canadiens in total goals scored for the season. Montreal needed to win its game <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Hawks, or score at least five goals to qualify for the postseason. Trailing 5–2 with eight minutes to play, head coach Claude Ruel pulled his goaltender for an extra skater and watched Montreal surrender five empty net goals while scoring none to lose the game 10–2 and the final playoff spot to the Rangers. It was the only time between 1948 and 1995 that the Canadiens failed to make the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The Cunningham–Rawnsley team {{used the}} AI {{specifically}} to position themselves directly astern and underneath the enemy. Although the German bombers carried a dorsal gunner, {{it was difficult}} to locate an enemy <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> colour of the landscape. Usually the blackness of the country would swallow up the outline of an approaching night fighter. As they approached, the slipstream of the enemy could prove hazardous; bucking the Beaufighter and throwing the pilot off his aim. Approaching from slightly below allowed the attacking pilot to avoid the slipstream. The tactics allowed for Cunningham to close the range and fire first, which was usually sufficient to end the engagement quickly and successfully. Bob Braham, a rival night fighter ace, also used this tactic.|$|E
5|$|The Well-Manicured Man prefers subtlety to brute force, {{and will}} attempt to {{manipulate}} those in his way before using physical violence. Although the Syndicate's goals are opposed to those of Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the Well-Manicured Man will, at times, aid them with clues or information, believing that letting out {{a certain amount of}} information would help to keep the two close, and consequently allow for them to be controlled. The Well-Manicured Man openly despises The Smoking Man, seeing him as impulsive and unprofessional. The two maintain a bitter relationship within the Syndicate throughout the series. The Well-Manicured Man is instrumental in the Syndicate's secondary agenda, to develop a vaccination <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> oil used by the aliens as a means of mind control. To this end, he works with Russian double agent Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) to develop a vaccine, eventually testing it—successfully—on a Syndicate mole, Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden).|$|E
50|$|In 1977 the British Lions rugby union team toured New Zealand. The Lions played 26 matches, {{including}} four internationals <b>against</b> <b>the</b> All <b>Blacks.</b> They lost <b>the</b> series <b>against</b> <b>the</b> All <b>Blacks</b> by three matches to one. The team played as the British Isles in their internationals <b>against</b> <b>the</b> All <b>Blacks</b> and <b>the</b> British Lions for the non-international games.

5|$|In June 1968, Plante {{was drafted}} by the St. Louis Blues and signed for $35,000 for the 1968–69 season. In his first season with the Blues, Plante split the goaltending duties with Glenn Hall. He won the Vezina Trophy that season for the seventh time, surpassing Bill Durnan's record. While playing for the Blues in the 1969–70 playoffs against the Boston Bruins, a shot fired by Fred Stanfield and {{redirected}} by Phil Esposito hit Plante in the forehead, knocking him out and breaking his fibreglass mask. The first thing Plante said after he regained consciousness at the hospital was that the mask saved his life. That game proved to be his last for the Blues, and he was traded {{in the summer of}} 1970 to the Toronto Maple Leafs. He led the NHL with the lowest goals against average (GAA) during his first season with the Maple Leafs. At season's end, he was named to the NHL's second All-Star team, his seventh such honour. He continued to play for the Leafs until he was traded to the Boston Bruins late in the 1972–73 season, recording a shutout <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Hawks in his debut for the Bruins. He played eight regular season and two playoff games for the Bruins to finish that season, his last in the NHL.|$|E
5|$|Talion is then {{sought out}} by the warrior Lithariel, the {{daughter}} of Queen Marwen (Claudia Black), who claims {{to be able to}} assist Celebrimbor with his mission. Marwen is the ruler of Núrn, a kingdom of sea raiders located in the south of Mordor. She uses her powers to guide Talion and Celebrimbor to another of Celebrimbor's relics. Talion also gets help from a Dwarf hunter named Torvin, teaching Talion the ways of the hunt to dominate Caragors and Graugs (beasts native to Mordor), eventually fighting a massive Graug from Torvin's past who killed Torvin's hunting partner, later revealed to be his brother. Later, Marwen advises them to use Celebrimbor's powers to take control of an army of orcs and other beasts, using them to lead an assault against Sauron. Talion eventually realizes that the wizard Saruman is possessing Marwen, and assists Lithariel in freeing her from his control. Talion, however, still carries out Saruman's plan, leading an army of mind-controlled orcs in an assault <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Hand's stronghold at Ered Glamhoth. However, rather than the Black Hand, Talion finds the Tower of Sauron waiting for him. The Tower mockingly taunts Talion that Celebrimbor chose him as a host and can free him at any time and offers the elf a place at Sauron's side. Refusing the offer, the two battle and Talion emerges victorious after viciously stabbing the Tower to death with his son's sword. Afterwards, Celebrimbor confesses that the Tower told the truth and promises to let Talion join his family in death if he wishes, once the Black Hand is slain.|$|E

25|$|Saint Giles is {{the patron}} saint of cripples and is also invoked as a saint for {{childhood}} fears, convulsions, depression, particularly in Normandy, for example in Eure Iville, Saint-Germain-Village or Bernay or in Calvados, Gilles Touques. In medieval art, he is depicted with his symbol, the hind. His emblem is also an arrow. Giles is one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers, and the only non-martyr, initially invoked as protection <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Death. His feast day is 1 September.|$|E

25|$|What {{eventually}} led to Hamilton being defeated for re-election in 1984, was a 1980 reapportionment battle <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Caucus, who wanted the reapportionment figured to their advantage. Hamilton felt so strongly they were wrong, that she ended up testifying before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in 1982. The Black Caucus were so angered by what they {{believed to be a}} betrayal by Hamilton, that they put Mable Thomas against her in the primary. Hamilton lost to Thomas in the run-off election and never held elected office again.|$|E
25|$|In April 1979, the Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 decision, {{overturned}} the dismissal, holding {{that the evidence}} introduced at trial supported the allegations of a conspiracy among the Chicago police, the Cook County State’s Attorney, and the FBI <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Panther members. The appeals court further ruled {{that the government should}} be sanctioned for suppression of the FBI documents and that Taylor and Haas were wrongfully cited for contempt. In 1982, the case was settled for $1.85 million. It was never determined who fired the first shot at the apartment.|$|E
25|$|Aragorn led the Fellowship of the Ring {{following}} {{the loss of}} Gandalf in the Mines of Moria while fighting the Balrog.

Then he fought in the battle at Helm's Deep and the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. After defeating Sauron's forces in Gondor, he led an army of Gondor and Rohan <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Gate of Mordor to distract Sauron's attention so that Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee could have a chance to destroy the One Ring.|$|E

25|$|Race decoratus {{is found}} in the Andaman and Nicobar islands and is very similar to the typical form, from which it can be {{distinguished}} as follows: Upperside green spots smaller, especially the discal series on the forewing. Underside hindwing: the red postcostal spot is relatively small but the red part has much increased <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> part; besides the large red anal mark and the mark before the first disco-cellular veinlet, there is a large red spot in the lower median cellule (interspace 2), a smaller red spot {{in each of the three}} preceding cellules (interspaces 3, 4, 5) and a streak-like spot at the base of the lower median cellule.|$|E
25|$|The first red-figure vases were {{produced}} around 530 BC. The {{invention of the}} technique normally is accredited to the Andokides Painter. He, and other early representatives of the style, e.g. Psiax, initially painted vases in both styles, with black-figure scenes on one side, and red-figure on the other. Such vases, e.g. the Belly Amphora by the Andokides Painter (Munich 2301), are called bilingual vases. Although they display major advances <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> figure style, the figures still appear somewhat stilted and seldom overlap. Compositions and techniques of the older style remained in use. Thus, incised lines are quite common, as is the additional application of red paint ("added red") to cover large areas.|$|E
25|$|Archibald's {{first major}} {{appearance}} in history is recorded in 1356 at the Battle of Poitiers {{where he was}} captured by the English. Archibald had accompanied his cousin, William Lord of Douglas, to serve King John II of France in his wars <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Prince. Edward III of England had concluded truce negotiations with the Scots lasting from 25 March until Michaelmas, following the Burnt Candlemas of 2 February. During the truce, Earl William had secured safe passage to travel to Château Gaillard to visit David II; amongst his entourage was the 28-year-old Archibald. Once in France, in the chivalric spirit of the age the Douglases joined the French army, to prevent their harnesses rusting through inactivity.|$|E
