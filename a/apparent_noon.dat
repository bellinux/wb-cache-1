5000|$|Here {{time and}} angle are {{quantities}} {{that are related}} by factors such as: 2 radians = 360° = 1 day = 24 hours. The difference, EOT, is measurable since GHA is an angle that can be measured and Universal Time, UT, is a scale for the measurement of time. The offset by [...] = 180° = 12 hours from UT is needed because UT is zero at mean midnight while GMHA = 0 at mean noon. Both GHA and GMHA, like all physical angles, have a mathematical, but not a physical discontinuity at their respective (<b>apparent</b> and mean) <b>noon.</b> Despite the mathematical discontinuities of its components, EOT {{is defined as a}} continuous function by adding (or subtracting) 24 hours in the small time interval between the discontinuities in GHA and GMHA.|$|R

50|$|Prior to 1920, all ships kept solar time on {{the high}} seas by setting their clocks at night or at the morning sight so that, given the ship's speed and direction, it would be 12 o'clock when the sun crossed the ship's meridian. The local <b>apparent</b> <b>noon</b> is 12 noon.|$|E

5000|$|Unfortunately, the Earth {{does not}} make a perfect {{circular}} orbit around the Sun. Due to the elliptical nature of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun, the speed of the Sun’s apparent orbit around the Earth varies throughout the year and that causes it to appear to speed up and slow down very slightly. Consequently, noon at the Prime Meridian is rarely if ever exactly at 1200 UTC, but rather it occurs some minutes and seconds before or after that time each day. This slight daily variation has been calculated and is listed for each day {{of the year in the}} Nautical Almanac under the title of Equation of time. This variation must be added to or subtracted from the UTC of local <b>apparent</b> <b>noon</b> to improve the accuracy of the calculation. Even with that, other factors, including the difficulty of determining the exact moment of local <b>apparent</b> <b>noon</b> due to the flattening of the Sun’s arc across the sky at its highest point, diminish the accuracy of determining longitude by chronometer as a method of celestial navigation. Accuracies of less than 10 nmi km error in position are difficult to achieve using the [...] "longitude by chronometer" [...] method. Other celestial navigation methods involving more extensive use of both the Nautical Almanac and sight reduction tables are used by navigators to achieve accuracies of one nautical mile (1.9 km) or less.|$|E
50|$|A tall pole {{vertically}} {{fixed in}} the ground casts a shadow on any sunny day. At one moment during the day, the shadow will point exactly north or south (or disappear when and if the Sun moves directly overhead). That instant is local <b>apparent</b> <b>noon,</b> or 12:00 local apparent time. About 24 hours later the shadow will again point north/south, the Sun seeming to have covered a 360-degree arc around the Earth's axis. When the Sun has covered exactly 15 degrees (1/24 of a circle, both angles being measured in a plane perpendicular to the Earth's axis), local apparent time is 13:00 exactly; after 15 more degrees it will be 14:00 exactly.|$|E

40|$|Before {{the wide}} {{distribution}} of standard time signals by tele-graph and {{radio in the}} late nineteenth and early twentieth cen-turies, the reported times of earthquakes usually were based on times established from observations of local <b>apparent</b> <b>noon</b> on a sundial. This paper proposes to use the calculation of the actual standard sun transit time to correct these local times of earthquakes so they may be listed with universal times (UT). Examples are shown of how this method would apply to two nineteenth-century earthquakes in eastern North America...|$|E
40|$|The quantum {{efficiency}} of in situ photosynthesis for natural phytoplankton populations {{has been determined}} at various localities and depths in the ocean. Quantum efficiencies increased linearly with the logarithm of decreasing incident quanta at a rate varying with location. During the SCOR Discoverer Expedition of May 1970, data were collected {{with the objective of}} computing the quantum effi-ciency of photosynthesis by in situ natural phytoplankton populations. Photosynthesis was dctermincd by the method of in situ lzLC fixation, and optical measurements were made to document the total quantum irradiance transmission of the ocean water for daylight as a function of depth (for the spectral range from 350 - 700 nm). In addi-tion to this, a recording of incident quanta as a function of time was obtained for the full incubation period, which lasted from local <b>apparent</b> <b>noon</b> to sunset (very nearly 6 h), at the site of one of the incubation samples immersed in the ocean. Concentra-tions of chlorophyll a and pheopigmcnts were also measured. The quantum cffi-ciencics have been calculated from the ra-tio of 14 C fixed per half day divided by the total quanta absorbed by the viable phyto-plankton pigments per half day. Graphical an d mathematical formulations of Beer’s law have been used to calculate the total quanta absorbed by the viable plant pig-ments. The method also permits calcula-tion of irradiance attenuation cocfficicnts for the four specified absorbing constitu-ents enumerated for ocean water...|$|E
