5|$|Both Pavilions were {{scheduled}} to be unveiled on June 19, 2009. However, the Pavilion by Hadid endured construction delays and a construction team change, which led to nationwide coverage of the delay in publications such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. Only its skeleton was availed to the public on the scheduled date, and the work was completed and unveiled on August 4, 2009. The van Berkel pavilion endured a temporary closure due to unanticipated wear <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> from August 1014.|$|E
5|$|Composite {{materials}} make up 43% of the airframe, and the proprotor blades {{also use}} composites. For storage, the V-22's rotors fold in 90 seconds and its wing rotates to align, front-to-back, with the fuselage. Due to {{the requirement for}} folding rotors, their 38-foot diameter is 5 feet less than optimal for vertical takeoff, resulting in high disk loading. Most missions use fixed wing flight 75% {{or more of the}} time, reducing wear <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> and operational costs. This fixed wing flight is higher than typical helicopter missions allowing longer range line-of-sight communications for improved command and control.|$|E
5|$|In practice, the {{flexibility}} which the OBO design allows has gone largely unused, as these ships tend {{to specialize in}} either the liquid or dry bulk trade. Also, these ships have endemic maintenance problems. On one hand, due to a less specialized design, an OBO suffers more from wear <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> during dry cargo onload than a bulker. On the other hand, components of the liquid cargo system, from pumps to valves to piping, tend to develop problems when subjected to periods of disuse. These factors have contributed to a steady {{reduction in the number}} of OBO ships worldwide since the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|Public protests {{took place}} in New Delhi on 21 December 2012 at India Gate and Raisina Hill, the latter being the {{location}} of both the Parliament of India and Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the President of India. Thousands of protesters clashed with police and battled Rapid Action Force units. Demonstrators were baton charged, shot with water cannon <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> gas shells, and arrested.|$|E
5|$|The yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} is {{very fond}} of the larvae of tree-boring beetles, such as the longhorn beetle Tryphocaria acanthocera, and cossid moth Xyleutes boisduvali. Birds seek them out all year but especially in June and July, when the moth caterpillars are largest, and they are accompanied by their just fledged young. They search out holes and make some exploratory bites looking for larvae. If successful, they peel <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> down a strip of bark to make a perch for themselves before continuing to gouge and excavate the larvae, which have deeply tunneled into the heartwood.|$|E
5|$|Then, in a {{calculated}} attack, approximately 500 Arsenal fans attacked {{from the main}} road behind the Galatasaray fans. This caused a severe riot in the city square, with several restaurant facilities used by fans to fight each other, with iron bars and knives also being used. This lasted 20 minutes before the Danish police attempted {{to break up the}} melee with dogs <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> gas. The violence, which included fans from other English clubs and Turks living in Denmark, lasted for 45 minutes. There were further clashes at the airport the day after the game.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two basic}} {{aerodynamic}} models of insect flight. Most insects use a method that creates a spiralling leading edge vortex. Some very small insects use the fling and clap or Weis-Fogh mechanism in which the wings clap together above the insect's body and then fling apart. As they fling open, the air gets sucked in and creates a vortex over each wing. This bound vortex then moves across the wing and, in the clap, acts as the starting vortex for the other wing. Circulation and lift are increased, {{at the price of}} wear <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> on the wings.|$|E
5|$|Both pavilions were {{scheduled}} to be unveiled on June 19, 2009. However, Hadid's pavilion was not ready in time; it had construction delays and a construction team change, which led to coverage of the delay in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. Only its aluminum skeleton was available for public viewing on the scheduled date; the work was completed and unveiled on August 4, 2009. The van Berkel pavilion was temporarily closed for repairs August 10–14, due to unanticipated wear <b>and</b> <b>tear.</b> Both pavilions were dismantled after November 1, 2009; the materials from van Berkel's were recycled, while Hadid's was stored for possible exhibition elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Bristol Rovers {{denied that}} they were {{interested}} in signing Fortune-West in June 2003, before Doncaster Rovers of the Third Division signed him on a two-year contract. His first season with the club, 2003–04, saw him score 12 goals in 43 appearances as they won the Third Division championship, earning promotion to the Second Division. During this season, he formed a strike partnership with Gregg Blundell. Fortune-West suffered a knee injury caused by wear <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> to the knee joint in October 2004, which resulted in him undergoing surgery, before returning to the team in March 2005. He was to be offered a new deal in April 2005 and finished the season with 7 goals in 28 appearances. The 2005–06 season was his last with Doncaster, as he was released after scoring 4 goals in 33 appearances.|$|E

5|$|De Soto {{continued}} her patrols in the Gulf of Mexico into {{the month of}} August, braving the sweltering heat to board and inspect coastal and seaborne traffic. The steamer Alice Vivian was seized on 16 August, as she had no papers, and the steamer Nita was taken the next day for the same reason. During this month, wear <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> on the steamer's boilers began to show and, despite attempts at repair, De Soto steadily lost speed. On 12 September, following a nine-hour chase under steam and sail, the Union ship finally took the blockade runner Montgomery, a chase Capt. Walker claimed should have taken one fourth the time if the boilers were in good order. Tinkering helped build up steam pressure to a point, and De Soto managed to chase down the screw steamer Leviathan on 22 September.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Ben Shoshan and Yehuda Etzion, both {{members of}} the Gush Emunim Underground, plotted {{to blow up the}} al-Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock. Etzion {{believed}} that blowing up the two mosques would cause a spiritual awakening in Israel, and would solve all the problems of the Jewish people. They also hoped the Third Temple of Jerusalem would be built on the location of the mosque. On 15 January1988, during the First Intifada, Israeli troops fired rubber bullets <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> gas at protesters outside the mosque, wounding 40 worshipers. On 8October1990, 22 Palestinians were killed and over 100 others injured by Israeli Border Police during protests that were triggered by the announcement of the Temple Mount Faithful, a group of religious Jews, {{that they were going to}} lay the cornerstone of the Third Temple.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the cast}} and writers of TGS are {{preparing}} their annual Ludachristmas party in the writer's room. Tracy is annoyed because {{he is unable to}} attend due to a recent order from a courtroom judge which requires him to wear an alcohol monitoring ankle bracelet. Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) is also annoyed because he believes that none of the staff know what the true meaning of Christmas is. He cancels Ludachristmas and makes the staff sit through a talk, led by himself and Reverend Gary (John F Mooney), about the meaning of Christmas. This inspires {{the cast and}} writers to run outside of 30 Rock <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> down the big Christmas tree which is outside the building. Kenneth eventually stops their efforts and Tracy reveals that he has been drinking alcohol when he should not have been.|$|E

5|$|Returning from Tarawa, Radford was reassigned {{as chief}} of staff to Towers, who was Commander, Air Force, Pacific Fleet. He {{assisted}} in planning upcoming operations, including Operation Flintlock, the invasion of the Marshall Islands. He had hoped to return to combat duty {{at the end of this}} assignment, but in March 1944 he was ordered to Washington, D.C. and appointed as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations. He assumed this new duty on 1 April, a role which was primarily administrative in nature. His duties included establishing a new integrated system for aircraft maintenance, supply, and retirement, for which he was appointed the head of a board to study aircraft wear <b>and</b> <b>tear.</b> After six months in this duty, Radford was returned to the Pacific theater by Admiral Ernest J. King, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and Commander in Chief, United States Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Samson was {{betrayed by}} his lover Delilah, who ordered a servant {{to cut his}} hair while he was {{sleeping}} and turned him over to his Philistine enemies, who gouged out his eyes and forced him to grind grain in a mill at Gaza. When the Philistines took Samson into their temple of Dagon, Samson asked to rest {{against one of the}} support pillars; after being granted permission, he prayed to God and miraculously recovered his strength, allowing him to grasp hold of the columns <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> them down, killing himself and all the Philistines with him. In some Jewish traditions, Samson {{is believed to have been}} buried in Tel Tzora in Israel overlooking the Sorek valley.|$|E
5|$|Squads of Special Forces {{and combat}} police {{flattened}} the gates and smashed {{their way into}} the pagoda at around 00:20 on 21 August as Xá Lợi's brass gong was struck to signal the attack. Nhu's men were armed with pistols, submachine guns, carbines, shotguns, grenades <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> gas. The red-bereted Special Forces were joined by truckloads of steel-helmeted combat police in army camouflage uniforms. Two of Nhu's senior aides were seen outside Xá Lợi directing the operation, while Nhu and his wife, Madame Nhu, watched the action from a nearby tank. Monks and nuns who barricaded themselves behind wooden shields were attacked with rifle butts and bayonets. The sound of the pagoda's gong was largely masked by that of automatic weapons fire, exploding grenades, battering rams, shattering glass and human screaming. The military personnel shouted as they attacked, as did the occupants, in fear.|$|E

5|$|The A1 route was {{designated}} in 1921 by the Ministry of Transport under the Great Britain road numbering scheme. Through the inner boroughs of the City, Islington, and Haringey it uses existing roads and streets; {{when it reaches}} {{what is now the}} outer London borough of Barnet, some stretches of purpose-built new roads were built, and others have been widened and made into dual carriageways. In 1828, John Benjamin Macneill, chief engineer to Thomas Telford, used Roman cement and gravel to solve problems with wear <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> on the Archway Road section of what is now the A1, an innovative technique that was used there for the first time, and is the basis for modern road building.|$|E
5|$|The codex {{is poorly}} preserved; the {{surviving}} page fragments display {{a number of}} figures in central Mexican style, combined with Maya numbering and day glyphs. The document is currently held by the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico city and is not on public display. The physics institute of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México subjected the codex to non-destructive testing {{in an effort to}} determine its authenticity. The results were published in 2007 and were mixed; the document apparently contains genuine pre-Columbian materials but certain aspects, such as seemingly artificially induced wear <b>and</b> <b>tear,</b> are suspect. The researchers concluded that they were unable to prove or disprove the pre-Columbian nature of the codex.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Jo arms {{herself with}} her knife and stalks Kator as he hunts swans {{on a nearby}} river. Her attempt to {{eliminate}} him is thwarted when he starts to drown, alerting Jessica with his screams. Jessica and Jo rescue Kator and take {{him back to the}} house. While the two women clean themselves up, Kator kills and consumes Wally. Jessica tells Jo that she is no longer willing to be controlled and is leaving with Anders. Outraged, Jo knocks Jessica unconscious and runs into the woods to dig a grave for her. On waking, Jessica seduces Kator. As they start to have sex, Kator's predatory instincts are stirred, causing him to revert to his natural form <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> open Jessica's throat, killing her. Having returned to the house, Jo attempts to flee but falls into the open grave and presumably meets a similarly violent end.|$|E
