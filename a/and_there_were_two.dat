5|$|Subtropical Storm Alpha (also called Alfa) {{was a rare}} {{off-season}} subtropical cyclone {{that hit}} Georgia in May 1972. It developed from a previously non-tropical cyclone in the western Atlantic Ocean, and initially it moved northeastward off the Carolinas. The storm turned southwestward due to a building ridge, and concurrently it intensified to become Subtropical Storm Alpha. It later moved ashore near Savannah, and it finally dissipated in the northeast Gulf of Mexico on May 29. It produced wave action and moderate rainfall along the coast. Damage totaled over $100,000 (1972USD), <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> associated deaths.|$|E
5|$|Due to Caroline’s compact size, {{sustained}} winds only reached 48mph (78km/h) in Brownsville, Texas. The storm also dropped {{heavy rain}} the southern {{portion of the}} state, as much as 11.93in (302mm) in Port Isabel. In Brownsville, Caroline broke a record for most rainfall within a 24-hour period {{during the month of}} August. The rainfall caused minor flooding. This helped end a prolonged drought in the Rio Grande Valley. It canceled most of the Labor Day holiday season for South Padre Island, one of the busiest weekends for tourism on the island. Caroline also produced storm tides 1–4feet (0.3-1.2m) above normal along coastal sections of southern Texas. Overall damage in southern Texas was minor, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> indirect fatalities due to drowning incidents in Galveston.|$|E

25|$|In 1906 {{the school}} was {{established}} as Truro Cathedral School by the Dean and Chapter as a Church of England public school.

Pearson and built in the precincts of the cathedral. In 1925 the headmaster resided at Trewinnard Court. At that time choristers paid no tuition fees <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> Bray scholarships open to choristers worth £30 p.a. The Hawkins scholarship worth £80 p.a. was open to former pupils studying at a university and tenable for three years. By the 1920s the cathedral school's reputation had significantly increased.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was a shoulder-wing monoplane {{powered by a}} 52kW (70hp) Gnome Gamma 7-cylinder rotary engine driving a two bladed propeller. The pilot and passenger were seated in side-by-side configuration: the control column was centrally mounted <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> sets of rudder pedals, {{so that it could}} be flown from either seat. The shallow section rectangular fuselage tapered to a horizontal knife-edge at the tail, with the elongated triangular horizontal stabiliser mounted in the middle, its covering blending into that of the upper and lower fuselage surface. A semi-elliptical elevator was mounted on the trailing edge, and a triangular balanced rudder was mounted above the rear fuselage. Lateral control was effected by wing-warping, the wires leading to a single inverted V-strut cabane above the fuselage and a similar V strut beneath. Petrol was stored in three tanks: a pair of gravity tanks were located under the top decking in front of the cockpit, pressure-fed from a larger tank under the seats.|$|E

25|$|Investigators {{discovered}} that the aircraft {{was the subject of}} a large number of complaints by pilots, called write-ups in the aviation industry. The highest number of complaints concerned the captain's side vertical speed indicator, which informs the air crew of the rate (in ft/min: Feet Per Minute) at which the aircraft is ascending or descending. In all, 48 complaints were made regarding the instrument in the three months before the crash. The aircraft's left right inertial reference system, which informs pilots what direction the aircraft is turning in, was complained about a total of thirty times. The International Herald Tribune reported that this may be of particular significance. The third most-complained about instrument was a fuel differential light, which received fifteen write-ups. Numerous complaints were also received about inoperative cockpit instrument lights, as well as multiple other malfunctions. Several complaints were made that the flaps, which modify drag and lift during take-off and landing, were jamming at twenty-five degrees upon landing, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> complaints that the weather radar was faulty.|$|E
25|$|Byzantine {{rule was}} {{interrupted}} by the Third crusade(1189-1192) when {{the army of the}} Holy Roman emperor Frederick Barbarossa conquered Philippopolis. Ivanko was appointed as the governor of the Byzantine Theme of Philippopolis in 1196, but between 1198 and 1200 separated it from Byzantium in a union with Bulgaria. The Latin Empire conquered Philippoupolis in 1204, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> short interregnum periods as the city was twice occupied by Kaloyan of Bulgaria before his death in 1207. In 1208 Kaloyan's successor Boril was defeated by the Latins in the Battle of Philippopolis. Under Latin rule, Philippopolis was the capital of the Duchy of Philippopolis, which was governed by Renier de Trit, later on by Gerard de Strem and was possibly at times a vassal of Bulgaria or Venice. Ivan Asen II conquered the duchy finally in 1230 but the city had possibly been earlier conquered. Afterwards Plovdiv was conquered by Byzantium, according to some information, by 1300 Plovdiv was a possession of Theodore Svetoslav of Bulgaria. It was conquered from Byzantium by George Terter II of Bulgaria in 1322. Andronikos III Palaiologos unsuccessfully besieged the city, but a treaty restored Byzantine rule once again in 1323. In 1344 the city and eight other cities were surrendered to Bulgaria by the regency for John V Palaiologos as the price for Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria's support in the Byzantine civil war of 1341–47.|$|E
