25|$|The swimbladder is {{very similar}} to S. bassensis and S. robusta, with a median {{anterior}} extension and very poorly developed anterolateral projections. The posterior median projection is short and <b>a</b> <b>duct</b> like process connects to the ventral surface of the swimbladder.|$|E
25|$|It is {{determined}} that the leak into the cable storage pit from unit 2 was likely due to a faulty joint where the pit meets <b>a</b> <b>duct.</b> The pit leads to a gravel layer beneath, resulting in highly radioactive water pouring directly into the sea.|$|E

25|$|In {{supersonic}} aerodynamics, unstart {{refers to}} a generally violent breakdown of the supersonic airflow. The phenomenon occurs when mass flow rate changes significantly within <b>a</b> <b>duct.</b> Avoiding unstarts is a key objective in design of the engine air intakes (inlets U.S.) of supersonic aircraft which cruise at speeds of M2.2+.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{embryonic}} development, the pancreas forms from the embryonic foregut {{and is therefore}} of endodermal origin. Pancreatic development begins {{with the formation of}} a ventral and a dorsal pancreatic bud. Each structure communicates with the foregut through <b>a</b> <b>duct.</b> The dorsal pancreatic bud forms the head, neck, body, and tail, whereas the ventral pancreatic bud forms the uncinate process.|$|E
50|$|Fenestron and FANTAIL are {{trademarks}} for <b>a</b> <b>ducted</b> fan mounted {{at the end}} of the tail boom of the helicopter and used in place of <b>a</b> tail rotor. <b>Ducted</b> fans have between eight and eighteen blades arranged with irregular spacing so that the noise is distributed over different frequencies. The housing is integral with the aircraft skin and allows a high rotational speed; therefore, <b>a</b> <b>ducted</b> fan can have a smaller size than a conventional tail rotor.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> {{striated}} <b>duct</b> (Pflüger's <b>ducts</b> [...] ) is <b>a</b> gland <b>duct</b> which connects <b>an</b> intercalated <b>duct</b> to <b>an</b> interlobular <b>duct.</b> It {{is characterized}} by the basal infoldings of its plasma membrane, characteristic of ion-pumping activity by the numerous mitochondria. Along with the intercalated ducts, they function to modify salivary fluid by secreting HCO3− and K+ and reabsorbing Na+ and Cl− using the Na-K pump and the Cl-HCO3 pump, making the saliva hypotonic.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the same}} static thrust, <b>a</b> <b>ducted</b> fan has <b>a</b> smaller {{diameter}} than a free propeller, allowing smaller gear.|$|R
25|$|Air {{is blown}} or sucked through <b>a</b> <b>duct</b> {{equipped}} with a viewing port and instrumentation where models or geometrical shapes are mounted for study. Typically the air is moved through the tunnel using a series of fans. For very large wind tunnels several meters in diameter, a single large fan is not practical, and so instead an array of multiple fans are used in parallel to provide sufficient airflow. Due to the sheer volume and speed of air movement required, the fans may be powered by stationary turbofan engines rather than electric motors.|$|E
25|$|The {{size of the}} {{pancreas}} varies considerably. Several anatomical variations exist, relating to the embryological development of the two pancreatic buds. The pancreas develops from these buds {{on either side of}} the duodenum. The ventral bud eventually rotates to lie next to the dorsal bud, eventually fusing. If the two buds, each having <b>a</b> <b>duct,</b> do not fuse, a pancreas may exist with two separate ducts, a condition known as a pancreas divisum. This condition has no physiologic consequence. If the ventral bud does not fully rotate, an annular pancreas may exist. This is where sections of {{the pancreas}} completely encircle the duodenum, and may even lead to duodenal atresia.|$|E
25|$|Internally, {{the sexes}} of most marine animals can be {{determined}} {{by looking at the}} gonads. For example, male testes of spawning fish are smooth and white and account for up to 12% of the mass of the fish, while female ovaries are granular and orange or yellow, accounting for up to 70% of the fish's mass. Male lampreys, hagfish and salmon discharge their sperm into the body cavity where it is expelled through pores in the abdomen. Male sharks and rays can pass sperm along <b>a</b> <b>duct</b> into a seminal vesicle, where they store it for a while before it is expelled, while teleosts usually employ separate sperm ducts.|$|E

50|$|Fetuses before sexual {{differentiation}} {{are sometimes}} described as female by doctors explaining the process. This is technically not true.

25|$|The {{male and}} female {{reproductive}} organs are hidden underneath the last few sternites on the mesosternal (mesosternum) side. The female's structure is modified to work as an ovipositor while the male's is adapted as a copulatory structure. The female has oviducts that carry the developed eggs from the ovaries to the ovipositor. The males also have <b>a</b> <b>duct</b> that carries the sperm from the testes to the copulatory structure, which stays concealed until copulation. When fertilization takes place, the male leaves enough sperm in the female to fertilize all the eggs in the female's ovaries. The excess sperm is kept in a special structure called spermatheca which holds the sperm until the eggs are fully developed.|$|E
25|$|In the vipers, {{which have}} the most highly {{developed}} venom delivery apparatus, the venom gland is very large and is surrounded by the masseter or temporal muscle, which consists of two bands, the superior arising from behind the eye, the inferior extending from the gland to the mandible. <b>A</b> <b>duct</b> carries venom from the gland to the fang. In vipers and elapids, this groove is completely closed, forming a hypodermic needle-like tube. In other species, the grooves are not covered, or only partially covered. From the anterior extremity of the gland, the duct passes below the eye and above the maxillary bone, to the basal orifice of the venom fang, which is ensheathed in a thick fold of mucous membrane. By means of the movable maxillary bone hinged to the prefrontal bone and connected with the transverse bone which is pushed forward by muscles set in action by {{the opening of the}} mouth, the fang is erected and the venom discharged through the distal orifice. When the snake bites, the jaws close and the muscles surrounding the gland contract, causing venom to be ejected via the fangs.|$|E
25|$|A {{diagnosis}} of hyposalivation is based predominantly on the clinical signs and symptoms. There is little correlation between symptoms and objective tests of salivary flow, such as sialometry. This test {{is simple and}} noninvasive, and involves measurement of all the saliva a patient can produce during a certain time, achieved by dribbling into a container. Sialometery can yield measures of stimulated salivary flow or unstimulated salivary flow. Stimulated salivary flow rate is calculated using a stimulant such as 10% citric acid dropped onto the tongue, and collection of all the saliva that flows {{from one of the}} parotid papillae over five or ten minutes. Unstimulated whole saliva flow rate more closely correlates with symptoms of xerostomia than stimulated salivary flow rate. Sialography involves introduction of radio-opaque dye such as iodine into the duct of a salivary gland. It may show blockage of <b>a</b> <b>duct</b> due to a calculus. Salivary scintiscanning using technetium is rarely used. Other medical imaging that may be involved in the investigation include chest x-ray (to exclude sarcoidosis), ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (to exclude Sjögren's syndrome or neoplasia). A minor salivary gland biopsy, usually taken from the lip, may be carried out if there is a suspicion of organic disease of the salivary glands. Blood tests and urinalysis may be involved to exclude a number of possible causes. To investigate xerophthalmia, the Schirmer test of lacrimal flow may be indicated. Slit-lamp examination may also be carried out.|$|E
40|$|Direct {{calculation}} of the internal structure of <b>a</b> <b>ducted</b> noise source from farfield pressure measurements is regarded as an initial value problem, where the pressure and pressure gradient (farfield impedance) {{are assumed to be}} known along a line in the farfield.

25|$|The yellowfin whiting has {{a similar}} body profile to most other Australian sillaginids, with colour and swimbladder {{morphology}} the simplest identifying features. It {{is one of the}} largest members of the Sillaginidae, growing to a known maximum known length of 42cm and a weight of 860 g. The body is elongate and compressed, with the dorsal profile more arched than the ventral. The mouth is small and oblique, having a broad band of villiform teeth in each jaw. There are two slightly separated dorsal fins, the first consisting of 10 to 12 spines and the second of 1 spine followed by 19 to 22 soft rays. The anal fin consists of 2 spines followed by 17 to 20 soft rays, the ventral of 1 spine and 5 soft rays and the pectoral of 15 to 16 rays. The caudal fin is emarginate, and is made up of 17 rays. The body is covered in small ctenoid scales extending to the upper head and nostrils of the fish, also present behind each ray of the dorsal and anal fins. The lateral line has 66 to 76 scales, and the cheek has 4 or 5 rows of scales, all of which are ctenoid. There is a total of 37 vertebrae in the species. The swimbladder has an incised anterior margin with no median or anterolateral projections and there is a single tapering posterior extension which rapidly narrows to a slender tube. <b>A</b> <b>duct</b> like process is present on the ventral surface of the swimbladder.|$|E

40|$|An {{incompressible}} potential-flow vortex {{method has}} been constructed {{to analyze the}} flow field of <b>a</b> <b>ducted</b> wind turbine following that outlined by Lewis (1991). Attention is paid to balancing the momentum change in the flow to the total longitudinal forces acting on the duct-turbine combination: the pressure force on the actuator disk plus the pressure forces acting on the duct, which typically includes a negative component of drag due to high leading-edge suction. These forces are shown to balance the momentum changes in the flow, resulting in a model for power output from <b>a</b> <b>ducted</b> wind turbine {{over a wide range}} of pressure changes across the actuator disk. The results are compared to the Betz actuator disk model and it is shown that the maximum power output from <b>a</b> <b>ducted</b> turbine occurs at a lower value of pressure drop/momentum extraction than that for a bare turbine...|$|R

Aboah escapes the hospital and meets Duff in a car; he paralyses Duff {{in the same manner as}} his other victims and inserts a long metal object up his nose. A policeman finds Duff and requests an ambulance, and the police tell Mulder and Scully that they are sweeping the area for Aboah. Driving around, Mulder tells Scully that he thinks Aboah is the mythical Teliko. He stops at a demolition site, remembering that Pendrell found asbestos fibers on Sanders' body.

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>ducted</b> {{propeller}} is {{well known}} to offer significant advantages for bollard pull performance of tugboats. A study about nozzle and propeller shape has been done for a long time, and a Ka series propeller and a conventional 19 A nozzle is used ordinarily for <b>a</b> <b>ducted</b> propeller. In late years a demand of the energy saving becomes very high because of a remarkable rises of the fuel oil price, and high bollard pull performance are demanded for tugboats at the same horsepower. Therefore, an improved design of <b>a</b> <b>ducted</b> propeller with high bollard pull performance is required. This present paper will describe the advanced design method of <b>a</b> <b>ducted</b> propeller which has high bollard pull performance. A nozzle section shape and a propeller are newly designed by a parametric study of the numerical simulation to have higher performance than <b>a</b> conventional <b>ducted</b> propeller. And the optimum arrangement between nozzle and propeller combination is studied. In order to confirm high bollard pull performance of the improved ducted propeller, the open water tests are carried out in a towing tank of Akishima Lavoratories (MITSUI ZOSEN) Inc. After {{the evaluation of the}} test results, the ducted propeller with high bollard pull performance is designed for actual tugboat. The newly designed ducted propeller is equipped for “Z-peller ” of Niigata Power Systems Co., Ltd as a propulsor of a tugboat, and the full-scale bollard pull test is conducted in the actual field. This paper will also present the field test results showing a higher bollard pull performance than the conventional ducted propeller...|$|R
