5|$|The {{content is}} divided into five parts. The first part, Ancient Balances, {{considers}} psychological and historical aspects of debt. Atwood calls debt an imaginative human construct derived from <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> need or greed and <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> fairness in reciprocity and equivalent values. She cites a study by Frans de Waal that suggests <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> fairness may be a genetic trait shared with other primates, and a study by Robert Axelrod which illustrates, given a level playing field, that the tit-for-tat strategy (or 'Do unto others as they have done onto you' strategy) was the most superior strategy in game theory. Debt and borrowing mechanisms from ancient and biblical societies are compared, including provisions from the Code of Hammurabi, Ancient Egyptians, and the Greco-Roman mythologies.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the different ethnic groups of the Dutch East Indies– modern day Indonesia– began to feel <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> national unity, as eventually formulated in the 1928 Youth Pledge.

5|$|At {{the same}} time, however, {{it is clear}} that Seth's mental states (desires, beliefs, etc.) have causal effects on his body and vice versa: A child touches a hot stove (physical event) which causes pain (mental event) and makes her yell (physical event), this in turn provokes <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> fear and protectiveness in the {{caregiver}} (mental event), and so on.|$|E
5|$|Colleagues have testified that, {{far from}} feeling bound or stifled by the Whiteman orchestra, as Green {{and others have}} suggested, Bix often felt <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> exhilaration.

5|$|Foundational {{elements}} for a student's learning {{were having a}} concept of (principally diatonic) scales as music and a basis for harmony.

5|$|In June 2013, Megadeth {{released}} its fourteenth studio album, Super Collider, to mixed critical reaction. In the {{months following the}} album's release, frontman and guitarist Dave Mustaine revealed {{that he and the}} rest of the band had already begun to discuss a follow-up, an urgency somewhat influenced by the then-recent death of Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman, which had reportedly given Mustaine <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> mortality.|$|E

Results showed that our beginning teachers had <b>a</b> good <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> efficacy, and classroom management was not differentiated from instructional or engagement efficacy. Further, personal qualities and physiological and affective states predicted self-efficacy scores, and having a number of opportunities to practice behaviour management skills was associated with <b>a</b> higher <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> efficacy.

Bernstein compares the public brutality of the lynch mob to the medieval English practice of hanging, drawing, and quartering people convicted of high treason.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the {{penultimate}} novel, You Only Live Twice, that Fleming gave Bond <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> family background. The book was the first to be written after the release of Dr. No in cinemas and Sean Connery's depiction of Bond affected Fleming's interpretation of the character, to give Bond both <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humour and Scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories. In a fictional obituary, purportedly published in The Times, Bond's parents were given as Andrew Bond, from the village of Glencoe, Scotland, and Monique Delacroix, from the canton of Vaud, Switzerland. Fleming did not provide Bond's date of birth, but John Pearson's fictional biography of Bond, , gives Bond a birth date on 11 November 1920, while a study by John Griswold puts the date at 11 November 1921.|$|E
