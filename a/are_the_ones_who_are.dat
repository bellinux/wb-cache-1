500|$|Since 1983, Shearer {{has been}} {{the host of the}} public radio comedy/music program Le Show. The program is a hodgepodge of satirical news commentary, music, and sketch comedy that takes aim at the [...] "mega morons of the mighty media". It is carried on many National Public Radio and other public radio {{stations}} throughout the United States. Since the merger of SIRIUS and XM satellite radio services the program is no longer available on either. The show has also been made available as a podcast on iTunes and by WWNO. On the weekly program Shearer alternates between DJing, reading and commenting on {{the news of the day}} after the manner of Mort Sahl, and performing original (mostly political) comedy sketches and songs. In 2008, Shearer released a music CD called Songs of the Bushmen, consisting of his satirical numbers about former President George W. Bush on Le Show. Shearer says he criticizes both Republicans and Democrats equally, and also says that [...] "the iron law of doing comedy about politics is you make fun of whoever is running the place" [...] and that [...] "everyone else is just running around talking. They <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> actually doing something, changing people's lives for better or for worse. Other people the media calls 'satirists' don't work that way." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} a topic of {{discussion}} of who is {{held accountable for the}} collection and distribution of personal information. Some will say that it is the fault of the social networks because they <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> storing the vast amounts of information and data, but others claim that it is the users who are responsible for the issue because it is the users themselves that provide the information in the first place. This relates to the ever-present issue of how society regards social media sites. There is {{a growing number of people}} that are discovering the risks of putting their personal information online and trusting a website to keep it private. Yet in a recent study, researchers found that young people are taking measures to keep their posted information on Facebook private to some degree. Examples of such actions include managing their privacy settings so that certain content can be visible to [...] "Only Friends" [...] and ignoring Facebook friend requests from strangers.|$|E

Mulholland told the jury he had been at the dam the day of the break, due to the dam keeper's call, but neither he nor Van Norman had observed anything of concern, nor found any dangerous conditions. Mulholland further testified that leaks in dams, especially of the type and size of the St. Francis, were common. During the Inquest Mulholland said, [...] "This inquest is a very painful thing for me to have to attend but it is the occasion of it that is painful. The only ones I envy about this thing <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> dead."

2500|$|There {{are three}} ways that an {{individual}} could become a registered nurse in Japan. After obtaining a high school degree the person {{could go to a}} nursing university for four years and earn a bachelor's degree, go to a junior nursing college for three years or go to a nursing school for three years. [...] Regardless of where the individual attends school they must take the national exam. Those who attended a nursing university have a bit of an advantage over those who went to a nursing school. They can take the national exam to be a registered nurse, public health nurse or midwife. In the cases of become a midwife or a public health nurse, the student must take a one-year course in their desired field after attending a nursing university and passing the national exam to become a registered nurse. The nursing universities are the best route for someone who wants to become a nurse in Japan. [...] They offer a wider range of general education classes and they also allow for a more rigid teaching style of nursing. These nursing universities train their students {{to be able to make}} critical and educated decisions when they are out in the field. Physicians <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> teaching the potential nurses because there are not enough available nurses to teach students. This increases the dominance that physicians have over nurses.|$|E

2500|$|A British {{professor}} of psychiatry, Anthony Storr, states in his book, Feet of Clay: A Study of Gurus, that he confines the word guru (translated by him as [...] "revered teacher") to {{persons who have}} [...] "special knowledge" [...] who tell, referring to their special knowledge, how other people should lead their lives. He argues that gurus share common character traits (e.g. being loners) and that some suffer from a mild form of schizophrenia. He argues that gurus who are authoritarian, paranoid, , or who interfere in the private lives of their followers <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> {{more likely to be}} unreliable and dangerous. Storr also refers to Eileen Barker's checklist to recognize false gurus. He contends that some so-called gurus claim special spiritual insights based on personal revelation, offering new ways of spiritual development and paths to salvation. Storr's criticism of gurus includes the possible risk that a guru may exploit his or her followers due to the authority that he or she may have over them, though Storr does acknowledge the existence of morally superior teachers who refrain from doing so. He holds the view that the idiosyncratic belief systems that some gurus promote were developed during a period of psychosis to make sense of their own minds and perceptions, and that these belief systems persist after the psychosis has gone. Storr applies the term [...] "guru" [...] to figures as diverse as Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, Gurdjieff, Rudolf Steiner, Carl Jung, Sigmund Freud, Jim Jones and David Koresh. The Belgian Indologist Koenraad Elst criticized Storr's book for its avoidance of the term prophet instead of guru for several people. Elst asserts that this is possibly due to Storr's pro-Western, pro-Christian cultural bias.|$|E
