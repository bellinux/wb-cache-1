5|$|The basic close combat from {{previous}} installments has been heavily refined and expanded into the CQC system. When unarmed or using a one-handed weapon, Snake can grab opponents <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> chokehold, {{at which point}} a variety of actions can be performed, such as choking the enemy unconscious, slitting the enemy's throat, or interrogating them at knifepoint to obtain information. The context, pressure applied to the button, and movement of the analog stick determine the action performed.|$|E
5|$|Haywood {{observed}} {{how the government}} frequently took the side of business to defeat the tactics and the aspirations of the miners. During an 1899 organizing drive in Coeur d'Alene, with pay cuts as a motivating issue, the company hired spies and then fired organizers and pro-union miners. Some frustrated miners responded with violence and when two men were killed, martial law was declared. As they had done in a strike in Coeur d'Alene seven years earlier, soldiers acted as strike breakers. They rounded up hundreds of union members without formal charges <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> filthy, vermin-infested warehouse without sanitation services for a year. They were so crowded that the soldiers locked the overflow of prisoners in boxcars. One local union leader was imprisoned for 17 years.|$|E

25|$|The {{prosecution}} {{turned to}} the events of the evening of June 12, 1994, where Karen Lee Crawford, the manager of the Mezzaluna restaurant where Brown ate that Sunday night, was called to testify. She recounted that Brown's mother phoned the restaurant at 9:37p.m. about a pair of lost eyeglasses. Crawford found them <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> white envelope. Waiter Goldman left the restaurant at 9:50p.m. after his shift, taking the glasses to drop them off at Brown's house.|$|E
25|$|For {{his first}} {{exhibition}} in USA, at the Eugenia Butler Gallery of Los Angeles (1970), he exhibited {{a series of}} 37 suitcases filled with cheese on the floor, below pictures made with cheese on the wall. Called Staple Cheese (A Race), a pun on Steeple Chase, the suitcases were to be opened one a day, whilst the wall pictures included a horizontal line tracking the vertical movement of the cheeses as they slid toward it. However, {{within a few days}} the over-powering smell, maggots and flies combined to make it impossible to enter the room. As a gesture to honor what he called “the exhibition’s true audience,” Roth collected some of the dead flies lying {{on the floor of the}} gallery space <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> glass jar. The suitcases were later stored in a container designed by Roth for a number of years until Butler's husband threw the whole exhibition away in the desert.|$|E
500|$|Super Smash Bros. was {{developed}} by HAL Laboratory, a Nintendo second-party developer, during [...] Masahiro Sakurai was interested in making a fighting game for four players. As he {{did not yet have}} any original ideas, his first designs were of simple base characters. He made a presentation of what was then called Kakuto-Geemu Ryuoh (Dragon King: The Fighting Game) to co-worker Satoru Iwata, who helped him continue. Sakurai understood that many fighting games did not sell well and that he had to think of a way to make his game original. His first idea was to include famous Nintendo characters <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fight. Knowing he would not get permission, Sakurai made a prototype of the game without sanction from Nintendo and did not inform them until he was sure the game was well-balanced. The prototype he presented featured Mario, Donkey Kong, Samus and Fox as playable characters. [...] The idea was later approved.|$|E

2500|$|Belgian {{journalist}} Jo Gérard {{claims that}} a 1781 family manuscript recounts that potatoes were deep-fried prior to 1680 in the Meuse valley, {{in what was}} then the Spanish Netherlands (present-day Belgium): [...] "The inhabitants of Namur, Andenne, and Dinant had the custom of fishing in the Meuse for small fish and frying, especially among the poor, but when the river was frozen and fishing became hazardous, they cut potatoes in the form of small fish <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fryer like those here." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cooper {{stated that}} [...] "we made [...] {{decision}} early on" [...] {{to keep the}} same plot structure. [...] "I remember we did this photo shoot for Vanity Fair {{and that was when}} we first talked about a sequel in a realistic way; and we were all in the room together afterwards and we were saying 'here's the choice: do we stray from the structure or do we run straight for it?' And we all agreed, no question about it, we hadn't earned the ability to take these 3 guys out <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new structure. There needs to be a ticking clock, {{there needs to be a}} missed night and there needs to be someone who's gone and a woman who is waiting to get married and a guy who needs to get married." ...|$|E
2500|$|The action had {{achieved}} disappointingly little {{as far as}} the British were concerned. Fulton claimed that his machines had not been used properly, and began to refine them to make them easier to handle. Keith, who had been skeptical from the start, was sympathetic, considering that they had been unlucky and that another attempt might bring greater success. [...] Melville acknowledged this, but noted that the attack had had psychological implications, by spreading panic amongst the French. The French began to construct a series of booms and chains across the entrance to frustrate similar attacks in the future, which took time <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> defensive rather than offensive mode of thinking. By now the winter weather had arrived, and all thoughts of invasion had to be postponed until the spring 1805 at the earliest. The nature of the devices used in the attack provoked derision from much of the British public, who regarded it as an unfair and unsporting method of waging war. Fulton made another attempt to use his devices against the fleet at Boulogne on 19 September 1805, this time in company with Sir Sidney Smith, but again the attack did not produce any significant results.|$|E

2500|$|The Transformer {{brothers}} {{also knew}} where he was, but he didn't look and just held his pole steady. The brothers came and landed {{on the side of}} the canoe. They asked the man, [...] "What are you doing?" [...] He responded, [...] "Oh, you are my grandchildren. Oh this here, this is my food that I am going to feed you with." [...] He tells the three men, [...] "I have a house right here, right there in that little bay. You bring your canoe over and come up ashore." [...] He pulled up his pole and had a lot of the moss ready. In the house, he had a big fire ready and a mountain of rock underneath, already hot. He took some sticks and grabbed the hot rocks <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bowl that was filled with water. When the rocks were dropped in, the water began to boil. He took the boiling water and placed the moss inside and then made soup. The tells the men to have a seat on his bench with his big hyu7kem plate. This was the first hyu7kem plate made because he knew these men were coming. It made this plate really fancy, and fed them with three Mountain Goat horn spoons. The three men ate the moss.|$|E
