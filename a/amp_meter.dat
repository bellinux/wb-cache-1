50|$|The FA {{could also}} use the older Nikkor AI (introduced in 1977) and AI'd Nikkor lenses, but in that case, the <b>AMP</b> <b>meter</b> and the shutter {{priority}} and High Speed program autoexposure modes would not {{work as well as}} AI-S lenses allowed (this is due to their non-linear aperture stop-down mechanisms).|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} type of {{magnetometer}} used for marine survey is the fluxgate magnetometer. Fluxgate magnetometers utilize two ferromagnetic cores each wound with a primary coil (in opposite directions) and an outer secondary coil attached to an <b>amp</b> <b>meter.</b> When an alternating current (AC) is passed through the primary coils, it creates two opposing magnetic fields that vary in intensity based on the outside magnetic fields. [...] By floating them parallel to the seafloor, they can measure the changes in magnetic fields over the seabed.|$|E

40|$|Caltech is at {{a unique}} turning {{with regards to}} energy usage and production. Not only is our energy {{consumption}} reaching critical loads, but we must also strive to obtain our needs from sources that are environmental-friendly and thus reduce our carbon footprint. Caltech has three major electricity conduits that each provide a maximum of 10 MW. Given that we are already peaking at about 22 MW and rising, this provides us with zero redundancy and a failure in any three of the conduits {{will result in a}} cascading power failure. My project is one of many steps that Caltech has taken to become more energy conscientious, specifically through improving the efficiency of Caltech’s numerous server rooms. Server rooms are oftentimes over 40 times more energy intensive than a typical corporate office building. Due to the fact that our centers were built in a period where energy sustainability was the least of our concerns, the first step in my project was to benchmark our rooms through the accepted metric called the PUE = (Total Facility Power) /(IT Equipment Power). Data was collected straight from our rooms using ultrasonic flow <b>meters,</b> <b>amp</b> <b>meters,</b> thermal guns and more to determine powe...|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{the other}} compact F-series SLRs, the FA used a plastic top plate: {{fiberglass}} reinforced polycarbonate {{for the black}} bodies, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) for the chrome ones. The FA also used the ultra-fast, bearing-mounted, honeycomb-patterned, titanium-bladed shutter and through-the-lens (TTL) off-the-film (OTF) electronic flash automation of the FE2, but added a digital liquid crystal display (LCD) information panel at the top left of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in, open aperture, through-the-lens (TTL) light meter versus the actual camera settings. Depending on the set exposure mode, the LCD would display +/- over/underexposure markers, HI/LO out of metering range warnings, shutter speed and/or f-stop. Unfortunately, the LCD could not be illuminated in low ambient light situations. The FA also had a removable finger grip, {{similar to the one}} introduced on the Nikon FG, and an eyepiece blind. However, the FA's real claim to fame was the <b>AMP</b> <b>meter.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{waterproof}} static pulse Petsafe BC 103 is bench tested submerged under fresh water, {{and under}} salt water, {{to see what}} it does to the function and output. The output in air with almost no resistance is around 1. 3 milli Amps, with resistance the output was so low it would not register a reading and was subjectively mildly aversive. Under fresh water subjectively the output was reduced by around half and the output was so low objectively the <b>amp</b> <b>meter</b> would not detect a reading. In salt water the output subjectively was absent and objectively was so low the <b>amp</b> <b>meter</b> would not detect a reading. The manufacturer does not recommend that the unit is repeatedly submerged. It would appear that the Petsafe BC 103 will not harm a dog should the dog take it into a swimming pool. The dog will, however, be able to bark with impunity. A waterproof anti-barking collar is recommended by the author for use where submersion is possible, but also in extremely dusty conditions where dust can cause a non-water proof device to cease functioning...|$|E
40|$|Surface DC resistivity, total gravity field, and {{horizontal}} gravity gradient surveys {{were conducted in}} an area of approximately 200 square miles near to the city of Estevan in southeastern Saskatchewan, Canada. The results of these surveys, together with the first arrivals from oil-company seismic records, were interpreted in an attempt to locate and delineate the bedrock-drift contact and sand and gravel deposits. Of all the techniques, only the surface resistivity technique proved useful. It was used successfully, with certain reservations, to indicate sand and gravel deposits, but could not be used to determine either the thickness of, or the depth to, the deposits. The surface resistivity technique, in conjunction with a drilling program, was used to locate accurately the buried preglacial Missouri River channel in the survey area. Density, DC resistivity, texture and pebble composition studies were made on split-barrel and chip samples obtained during a drilling program. Laqoratory studies indicate that {{on the basis of the}} physical properties investigated tills found in the test area cannot be readily differentiated. An apparent dependency of apparent resistivity on current density was observed both in field and laboratory measurements. Measurements were made between approximately 3 x 10 - 7 and 6 x 10 - 2 <b>amps</b> per square <b>meter.</b> At current densities less than about 3 x 10 - 4 <b>amps</b> per square <b>meter,</b> the apparent resistivity increases with increasing current density. At current densities greater than 3 x 10 - 4 <b>amps</b> per square <b>meter,</b> the apparent resistivity decreases with increasing current densities.

50|$|Even with laboratory-grade {{equipment}} {{measurement of}} standby power has its problems. There {{are two basic}} ways of connecting equipment to measure power; one measures the correct voltage, but the current is wrong; the error is negligibly small for relatively high currents, but becomes large for the small currents typical of standby—in a typical case a standby power of 100 mW would be overestimated by over 50%. The other connection gives a small error in the voltage but accurate current, and reduces the error at low power {{by a factor of}} 5000. A laboratory meter intended for measurement of higher powers may be susceptible to this error. Another issue is the possibility of measuring equipment damage if in a very sensitive range capable of measuring a few milliamps; if the device being measured comes out of standby and draws several <b>amps,</b> the <b>meter</b> can be damaged unless it is protected.|$|R
50|$|As {{the first}} {{generation}} of matrix <b>metering,</b> <b>AMP</b> was hardly foolproof. For instance, holding the FA vertically instead of horizontally might cause the meter to give different readings of the same scene. However, AMP was still demonstrably superior to the centerweighted type of light metering then in common use. AMP would give a good exposure 90-95% of the time versus 85-90% for centerweighting. Note that AMP was automatically disabled in the FA's manual exposure mode and could be turned off in the autoexposure modes. In both cases, the FA would default to Nippon Kogaku's traditional 60/40% centerweighted metering. However, the FA omitted the autoexposure memory lock of the FE2 - AMP was supposed to obviate any need for it.|$|R
40|$|The {{transient}} fields generated during switching {{operations in}} gas-insulated substations (GIS) can have rise {{times in the}} order of a few nanoseconds. Transient fields, which are developed internally to the gas-insulated modules, leak into the external environment through discontinuities and interfere with nearby electronics. Depending on the configuration of the GIS and the observation point, amplitudes of the electric and magnetic fields could be of the order of a few tens of kilovolts per meter and a few hundreds of <b>amps</b> per <b>meter,</b> respectively.

40|$|The {{transient}} over voltages {{are generated}} in gas insulated substations (GIS) during switching operation of substations {{in the order}} of a few nanoseconds. These transients have traveling wave behavior and travel to external systems through discontinuities and interface such as enclosures, bushings, cable joints etc. Depending up on configuration of the GIS and the amplitude of the electric and magnetic fields could be of the order of a few tens of kilovolts per meter and a few hundreds of <b>amps</b> per <b>meter</b> respectively. These very fast transient over (VFTO) voltages create critical situations in protection circuit and control circuit and makes raise faults in cables, transformers and secondary circuits, which result in malfunctioning of the primary equipment. The suppression of VFTO is very important in GIS systems. In this paper, included estimation of transient voltages in the switching operations has been calculated due to transient field with respect to 220 kv gas insulated substation during switching operation. The effect of Transient field have been analyzed and clearly demonstrated for substation by develop of suitable simulation model to estimate over transient voltages. The proposed approach successfully implemented in the platform of MATLAB software...|$|R
