5|$|Bowie perished {{with the}} rest of the Alamo {{defenders}} on March 6, when the Mexicans attacked. Most of the noncombatants in the fort, including Bowie's relatives, survived. Santa Anna ordered the alcalde of San Antonio, Francisco Antonio Ruiz, to confirm the identities of Bowie, Travis, and Crockett. After first ordering that Bowie be buried, as he was too brave <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> be burned like a dog, Santa Anna later had Bowie's body placed with those of the other Texians on the funeral pyre.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's volunteers {{responded to}} {{requests}} for military service {{in the early months}} of the war; however, as the war progressed and the number of casualties increased, the state government had to resort to conscription (the draft) to fill its quotas. Military conscription, which began in October 1862, was a divisive issue within the state. It was especially unpopular among Democrats, who viewed it as a threat to individual freedom and opposed legislation that allowed <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> purchase an exemption for $300 or pay another person to serve as his substitute. A total of 3,003 Hoosier men were drafted in October 1862; subsequent drafts in Indiana brought the total to 17,903.|$|E

5|$|Nonetheless, {{a report}} {{on the quality of the}} walls around 1460 noted that on the north and east sides of Southampton, the walls were still too thin to block a cannon shot or for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> stand on them; a wood and earth wall-walk had been built behind the walls, but this was proving very {{expensive}} to maintain. This contemporary assessment of the weakness of the eastern walls has been confirmed by modern archaeological excavation – in places it was only 0.76 m (2.49 feet) thick, compared to a typical thickness in other English town walls of around 1 m (3.28 feet).|$|E

5|$|A pimp rapes Number 18 in a bar, then enslaves her sexually. Number 18's {{father died}} when she was young and her family {{struggled}} to support her thereafter. Strangers took her from her home in Cambodia as a child, replaced her name with a number, and prostituted her in various countries. Number 18 ends up in the Thai child prostitution industry. Most of her clients are rich men, many of them foreign tourists. In a brothel and bar called The Pearl, Number 18 is kept in a dark room containing only a table and a dilapidated bed. Whenever she fails to follow the orders of Mama, the brothel-keeper, Mama shouts at her and beats her. Number 18 prays for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> come and save her from these ordeals. At the same time she becomes the most elegant and highly sought-after prostitute at The Pearl and her pimp's favourite. She becomes very proficient in pleasing men sexually but also remains childlike—she dries her face with her skirt and plays with its hem.|$|E

5|$|Artillery {{powered by}} {{gunpowder}} {{was introduced to}} Europe in the 1320s and spread quickly. Handguns, which were initially unpredictable and inaccurate weapons, were not recorded until the 1380s. Castles were adapted to allow small artillery pieces– averaging between – to fire from towers. These guns were too heavy for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> carry and fire, but if he supported the butt end and rested the muzzle {{on the edge of}} the gun port he could fire the weapon. The gun ports developed in this period show a unique feature, that of a horizontal timber across the opening. A hook on the end of the gun could be latched over the timber so the gunner did not have to take the full recoil of the weapon. This adaptation is found across Europe, and although the timber rarely survives, there is an intact example at Castle Doornenburg in the Netherlands. Gunports were keyhole shaped, with a circular hole at the bottom for the weapon and a narrow slit on top to allow the gunner to aim.|$|E
5|$|As part of William III and Mary II's {{coronation}} honours, Churchill {{was created}} Earl of Marlborough on 9 April 1689 (O.S.); {{he was also}} sworn {{as a member of}} the Privy Council and made a Gentleman of the King's Bedchamber. His elevation, however, led to accusatory rumours from King James's supporters that Marlborough had disgracefully betrayed his erstwhile king for personal gain; William himself entertained reservations about the man who had deserted James. Marlborough's apologists though, including his most notable descendant and biographer Winston Churchill, have been at pains to attribute patriotic, religious, and moral motives to his action; but in the words of Chandler, it is difficult to absolve Marlborough of ruthlessness, ingratitude, intrigue and treachery against <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> whom he owed virtually everything in his life and career to date.|$|E
5|$|Dick Harp was in {{the midst}} of his first season as head coach of the Kansas Jayhawks as the team entered the National Championship game. Kansas came into the season favored to win the {{national}} title. This was due in large part to Wilt Chamberlain joining the varsity team after finishing his freshman year on the freshman team per NCAA rules. At the beginning of the season, the Jayhawks starting line up consisted of Seniors Gene Elstun, Maurice King, John Parker, Lew Johnson, and Sophomore Chamberlain. Ron Loneski replaced Johnson's spot in the starting line up during the season. Harp began the season with <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> man defense, but later switched to a zone in order to give them an advantage in rebounding the basketball.|$|E

5|$|Initial police {{speculation}} {{was that}} Kinne had bribed guards {{to look the}} other way while she escaped the prison—an unusual blackout had been reported at the prison on the evening of and at the approximate time of her escape, and investigation showed that a door that should have been locked had been left unsecured—but further questioning of prison guards and administration showed that oversight at the prison was generally lax and that it was staffed by fewer guards than it should have been. News reports of the time reported numerous theories about Kinne's escape, including that she had bribed prison guards, that she may have enlisted the help of a supposed boyfriend who was a Mexico City policeman, that Kinne's mother had been involved in the escape plan, that a former Mexican secret service agent had assisted in her escape, and that Kinne may have disguised herself as <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> effect her escape. A more modern theory speculates that the family of Francisco Parades Ordoñez had helped her escape and then killed her.|$|E

While on the road, Ramsey receives a report about an armed suspect, and a brief chase ensues. The suspect, Eddie LeDoux, at first denies everything, then confesses to being the Phantom, but Morales is unconvinced. Johnson identifies him as his robber.|$|E
5|$|Mulan is a 1998 American {{animated}} musical action comedy-drama film {{produced by}} Walt Disney Feature Animation for Walt Disney Pictures.

5|$|No further {{information}} on the bishop's activities has survived before he was granted resignation by Pope Innocent IV on 21 February 1245. According to the Pope, Thomas had admitted committing several felonies, such as torturing <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> death, and forging a papal letter. Church representatives to oversee the resignation were the Archbishop of Uppsala and the Dominican prior of the Dacian province. Thomas donated his books to the newly established Dominican convent in Sigtuna {{and went on to}} live his last years in the Dominican convent in Visby, Gotland. He died there in 1248, shortly before the Second Swedish Crusade, which cemented Swedish rule in Finland for more than 550 years.|$|E
5|$|Rainfall reached 1inch (25mm) in {{portions}} of western Connecticut and Massachusetts. Strong surf from Isabel caused <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> drown after losing his footing {{along the beach}} near Narragansett, Rhode Island, and being swept out to sea. Officials in Connecticut contacted a water company in Watertown and a grocer in Cheshire for donations to assist the residents affected in North Carolina. A few days after Isabel moved ashore, the officials sent a tractor trailer truck with 2,000gallons (7570l) of water and 25,000pounds (11,340kg) of ice to North Carolina. In Vermont, the strong pressure gradient produced a peak wind gust of 55mph (89km/h) in Pleasant Valley, causing sporadic downed trees and power lines throughout the state. In Richmond, trees fell on and damaged threetrucks, and in Salisbury a falling tree damaged a car. Damage in the state totaled about $100,000 (2003USD, $117,000 in 2008USD). Rainfall reached 1inch (25mm) in various portions of New Hampshire and Maine.|$|E

Georgetown then began a thirteen-game win streak, which was followed by losing three straight to three conference opponents. The Hoyas then finished the regular season with nine more wins and one loss, which was good enough to finish second in the Big East regular season standings. The Hoyas won their first two games of the Big East Tournament by a collective margin of 29 points and advanced to the championship game against the Villanova Wildcats. The two teams were tied at halftime, but at halftime the Hoyas elected to use <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> man defense over a zone. This proved effective as they were able to force turnovers and shoot well from the field, which led them to win the game 7254. The Georgetown Hoyas won the Big East Tournament and also, a bid to the NCAA Tournament.|$|E
