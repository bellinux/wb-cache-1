5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In the face of death, she did not back down. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E

25|$|To you the IRA and all {{who support}} you or defend you, {{we have to}} say that we feel dirty today. Foul and dirty deeds by Irishmen are making Ireland a foul and dirty place, for it is things done by Irishmen that make us unclean. What the British could never do, what the Unionists could never do, you have done. You have made us bow our heads in shame <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> dirty feeling. The IRA is like a cancer in the body of Ireland, {{spreading}} death, killing and corruption. It is the unrelenting enemy of life and the community is afraid because it cannot see or identify it. We want the cancer of the IRA removed from our midst but not by means that will leave the moral fibre of society damaged and the system unclean. Fighting evil by corrupt means kills pawns like Joe and leaves every one of us vulnerable and afraid. And it allows Joe's killers to draw a sickening veneer of respectability over cold-blooded murder and to wash their hands like Pontius Pilate.|$|E

When asked why he made the film, Soderbergh stated, [...] "I {{needed to make the}} film, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> different feeling. I felt like, if I am worth anything, I have to say yes. I can't say no".

Then an unmastered version of [...] "Turn Off" [...] was leaked online in September 2008. After selecting the predominantly pop-sounding [...] "Energy" [...] and [...] "Return the Favor", Hilson selected [...] "Turnin Me On" [...] as In a Perfect World...s third single. When asked {{in an interview}} with That Grape Juice if choosing the song was a conscious effort, since the song had a different sound than the previous singles, Hilson responded, [...] "Absolutely! I mean, there’s another side of me. I’m from Decatur, Georgia <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> predominantly black neighbourhood with a lot of lower-class and some middle-class neighbourhoods. I guess that is the song that probably properly describes the type of girl I am, in relation to where I’m from.

500|$|Broady panned the {{navigation}} for being confusing, counter-intuitive, and requiring the player to revisit locations multiple times. He concluded his review by saying, [...] "The net effect {{is that the}} story—which made this game so intriguing in the first place—is almost totally lost, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> shame." [...] GameSpot considered the game {{one of the most}} disappointing of 1996 in their annual recap, writing [...] "the great premise is buried like the mysteries of the ages themselves under a mediocre Myst clone". Bob Strauss of Entertainment Weekly opined that the game tried to be too many things, and quipped, [...] "the result is a game so obscure, you'd be better off perusing something more comprehensible—like the collected works of Zoroaster." [...] Mark Reece and Brooke Adams of Deseret News also had mixed feelings about the game, calling it both [...] "clever and deep" [...] and [...] "frustrating and difficult". McDonald wrote that he was [...] "frustrated by the lack of good game play." [...] Hughes called the pace of the game and its puzzles both [...] "tedious" [...] and [...] "ponderous", but said it [...] "had ambition out the genetically modified ears." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{gave the}} pilot episode an [...] "Outstanding" [...] rating of 9 out of 10, with Dan Iverson {{starting}} his review by saying [...] "Every [...] a show will come along {{that will be}} so creepy and so intriguing that you feel compelled to watch. Dexter {{is one of those}} shows. [...] " [...] and summarized with [...] "The pilot episode did an extremely good job hooking us into the world of Dexter. We are meant to feel confused by his actions, and only time will tell how the show deals with this topic - will Dexter ever go too far, making us turn on our protagonist? There are so many questions that we have about this show, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> good thing. Personally we cannot wait to see how long this game of cat-and-mouse goes on with the unknown serial killer and Dexter. With the solid introduction to the series, characters, and future storylines, we can't help but recommend Dexter to anybody that is at all curious about the show. [...] " [...] IGN reviewer Matt Fowler later placed Mike Donovan third on a list of [...] "Dexter's Top 10 Kills", saying [...] "We all remember our first. First car. First love. First staph infection. And when it comes to Dexter, first kill. No Mike Donovan, the church choir master, wasn't Dexter first dead body, but he was our televisual introduction into Dexter's wicked world of revenge and reckoning." [...] IGN also declared the show as the [...] "Best New Psycho Drama of 2006".|$|E
500|$|Rainie's {{relationship}} with Phil Mitchell (McFadden) was first explored during her stint in 2010. Rainie and Phil {{were to be}} involved in a storyline involving the taking of crack cocaine. Discussing her return in 2010, she said she was pleased to be working closely with McFadden as they had not worked together. Franks explained that after being thrown out of the house by Tanya's ex-husband Max, and moving in with Phil that, [...] "it gets quite dark and dirty, really. Phil and Rainie are two people who meet at a point in their lives where they both see something equivalent in each other. He offers her something that she wants, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> place to be, while she has something that he wants, and that's drugs—so it's a match at that time." [...] Franks was given advice from the charity DrugScope on how to act the part and also undertook some of her own research, and she said she believed the scenes to be very realistic. She wanted the drugs storyline to help people, saying, [...] "If {{there are people who have}} a drugs problem, or an addiction problem of any kind really, they might watch something like this and it could trigger something in their mind that is relevant to them, or someone that they know. Hopefully it could make people think twice about carrying on with that, and perhaps look into getting some help. The organisation that we worked with, DrugScope, gives a lot of help and advice for people with drug addictions. I think it can be hugely helpful when a show as popular as EastEnders does something like this." [...] She also stated that if EastEnders [...] "has saved one life by putting this story out it's been worth it. The whole point of soaps is to reflect a certain amount of everyday life. Some of it is going to be light entertainment, some isn't." ...|$|E
