However, Dempsey did not apologise, saying he did not know enough about the incident and an inquiry was still being conducted. A senior advisor to Afghan President Hamid Karzai warned that Pakistan and Afghanistan may be on a course toward military conflict. Hamid Karzai contacted the Pakistani Prime Minister to discuss the NATO strike and gave his condolences over the deaths of soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The wave of anti-Chinese {{violence}} in the western United States following the Rock Springs Riot spread further, {{to the state of}} Oregon.

Other states reported incidents as well: As far away as Augusta, Georgia, <b>anger</b> <b>was</b> expressed against the Chinese in response to the massacre at Rock Springs. According to The New York Times, the rioting in Rock Springs fueled the desire of anti-Chinese Georgians in Augusta to air their grievances.|$|E
5|$|St. Anger is {{the eighth}} studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, {{released}} on June 5, 2003, by Elektra Records. It was the band's last album released through Elektra, and the second-longest timespan between studio albums from Metallica, with nearly six {{years between the}} release of Reload and this album. It is also the final collaboration between Metallica and producer Bob Rock, whose relationship began with the band's fifth studio album, 1991's Metallica. St. <b>Anger</b> <b>was</b> originally intended for release on June 10, 2003, but was released five days earlier due to concerns over unlicensed distribution through peer-to-peer file sharing networks. The St. Anger sessions also mark the only time Rock played when the music was being recorded, filling in for the departed bassist Jason Newsted.|$|E

5|$|St. <b>Anger</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} on June 5, 2003. It was originally scheduled for June 10, {{but due to}} Metallica's previous battle with Napster, and fear {{that it would be}} released illegally onto peer-to-peer file sharing networks, the band pushed the release date ahead by five days. A special edition of the album was released with a bonus DVD, featuring live, in-the-studio rehearsals of all of the St. Anger tracks. First week sales of the album were 417,000 copies, and it debuted at number 1 on the U.S. Billboard 200, as well as in 30 other countries around the world. In 2004, Metallica won the award for Best Metal Performance, for the title track.|$|E
5|$|The riot was {{sparked by}} a {{controversial}} umpiring decision, when star Australian batsman Billy Murdoch was given out by George Coulthard, a Victorian {{employed by the}} Englishmen. The dismissal caused an uproar among the parochial spectators, many of whom surged onto the pitch and assaulted Coulthard and some English players. It was alleged that illegal gamblers in the New South Wales pavilion, who had bet heavily on the home side, encouraged the riot because the tourists were in a dominant position and looked set to win. Another theory given to explain the <b>anger</b> <b>was</b> that of intercolonial rivalry, that the New South Wales crowd objected to what they perceived to be a slight from a Victorian umpire.|$|E
5|$|When Bonaparte {{learned that}} Ganteaume was {{anchored}} in Toulon rather than off the Egyptian coast, {{he was furious}} and ordered the squadron to return to sea and complete its mission as ordered. His <b>anger</b> <b>was</b> amplified by {{the news that the}} frigate Africaine, despatched from Rochefort with the same orders to resupply Egypt, had been captured at the Action of 19 February 1801 by the British frigate HMS Phoebe in the Western Mediterranean. To emphasise his instructions, Bonaparte sent General Jean-Gérard Lacuée to deliver them in person. Ganteaume was ordered to sail to Alexandria immediately, and if the Egyptian port was under attack by British forces, the troops were to be landed anywhere practical between Cape Rasat and Tripoli and make their way to Alexandria overland. Ganteaume sailed on 19 March, as soon as Lacuée had delivered the orders, with seven ships of the line, three frigates and three merchant ships carrying supplies.|$|E

5|$|In 1697, Parliament granted King William £50,000 to {{establish}} a household for the Duke of Gloucester, though the King only permitted the release of £15,000, keeping the difference for himself. The establishment of Gloucester's own household in early 1698 revived the feud between Anne and William. William was determined to limit Anne's involvement in the household, and therefore appointed, against her wishes, the low church Gilbert Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury, as Gloucester's preceptor. Anne was high church, and Burnet, knowing she was unhappy, attempted to decline the appointment, but the King insisted he accept it. Anne's <b>anger</b> <b>was</b> only placated by an assurance from King William that she could choose all the lower servants of the household. The Earl of Marlborough, a friend of Anne's, was appointed Gloucester's governor, after the Duke of Shrewsbury declined the office {{on the grounds of}} ill health. Shortly before the King sailed for the Netherlands, he received Anne's choices from Marlborough but he refused to confirm them. His favourite, the Earl of Albemarle, eventually convinced him to agree to Anne's appointments, and the King's acceptance was sent from the Netherlands in September 1698. The Marlboroughs' twelve-year-old son, Lord Churchill, was appointed Gloucester's Master of the Horse, and became a friend and playmate. Abigail Hill, a kinswoman of the Countess of Marlborough, was appointed his laundress, and Abigail's brother, Jack Hill, was made one of Gloucester's gentlemen of the bedchamber.|$|E

25|$|The final affective {{response}} or emotion seen in initial infidelity <b>is</b> <b>anger</b> (Johnson, 2017). <b>Anger</b> <b>is</b> {{an emotion}} that is felt in {{all stages of}} infidelity, but in different ways and at different calibers. In {{the initial stages of}} infidelity <b>anger</b> <b>is</b> an underlying emotion that is usually exposed after the buildup of other emotions such as jealousy and resentment. When a partner is suspicious of another’s intentions and actions they become frustrated with that partner and tend to get angry at them more easily and feel that the <b>anger</b> <b>is</b> not anticipated. In turn, the suspected unfaithful partner will be confused and become angry at the other starting fight. <b>Anger</b> <b>is</b> noticed to be a key emotion within a situation like infidelity, it takes on many roles and forms throughout the process but in the initial stage of cheating <b>anger</b> can <b>be</b> an affective emotion because of how unpredictable and rapid it can happen without thinking of one’s actions and feelings before doing so.|$|R
50|$|As {{with any}} emotion, {{the display of}} <b>anger</b> can <b>be</b> feigned or exaggerated. Studies by Hochschild and Sutton {{have shown that the}} show of <b>anger</b> <b>is</b> likely to be an {{effective}} manipulation strategy in order to change and design attitudes. <b>Anger</b> <b>is</b> a distinct strategy of social influence and its use (i.e. belligerent behaviors) as a goal achievement mechanism proves to be a successful strategy.|$|R
50|$|Carrying {{this concept}} further, Spielberger {{distinguished}} {{between state and}} trait <b>anger.</b> State <b>anger</b> <b>is</b> definded as a temporary emotional state while trait <b>anger</b> <b>is</b> a general tendency to react angrily to perceive situations. (Spielberger et al., 1983). Speilberger became a well-known authority on anger and its manifestations.|$|R

25|$|The {{disasters}} of {{the early}} part of Rome's second Punic War were attributed, in Livy's account, to a growth of superstitious cults, errors in augury and the neglect of Rome's traditional gods, whose <b>anger</b> <b>was</b> expressed directly in Rome's defeat at Cannae (216 BC). The Sibilline books were consulted. They recommended a general vowing of the ver sacrum and in the following year, the burial of two Greeks and two Gauls; not the first or the last of its kind, according to Livy.|$|E
