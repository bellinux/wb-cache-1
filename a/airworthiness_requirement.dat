5000|$|The current UK {{regulations}} {{match the}} European ones although earlier UK legal microlight definitions described an aeroplane {{with a maximum}} weight authorised of (finally) 390 kg, with a wing loading at the maximum weight authorised not exceeding 25 kg per square metre. Other than the very earliest aircraft, all two-seat UK microlights (and until 2007 all single-seaters) have been required to meet airworthiness standard BCAR Section S.In 2007 SSDR, a sub-category of single seat aircraft was introduced, allowing owners more freedom for modification and experiments. In 2015 the SSDR rules changed. The definition of a single seat microlight was adjusted to effectively de-regulate all single seat microlights for airworthiness purposes. There is no <b>airworthiness</b> <b>requirement</b> or annual inspection regime for SSDR microlights although pilots who fly them must have a normal microlight licence, and must observe {{the rules of the}} air. In the UK the microlight licence is currently called NPPL (National Private Pilots Licence).

The main content of the research are as follows: Firstly, this paper starts from the civil transport category aircraft flammable fluid related <b>airworthiness</b> <b>requirement</b> (§ 25. 863), including the research of development background, related advisory circular and main general compliance verification method. The compliance verification process of § 25. 863 is given.

40|$|Maximum cabin {{pressure}} altitude is limited by regulation to 2440 m (8 kft) for normal flight. In case of cabin depressurization, the {{cabin pressure}} altitude may rapidly increase up to maximum A/C altitude. To protect the passengers from lack of oxygen (hypoxia), the passenger supplemental oxygen supply shall provide per regulation a minimum oxygenation equivalent to 3050 m (10 kft) or 4270 m (14, 000 kft) whether the {{cabin pressure altitude}} is lower or higher than 5640 m (18 kft). The corresponding <b>airworthiness</b> <b>requirement</b> CS/FAR 25. 1443 (c) defines the minimum performance in term of oxygen partial pressure in the trachea. For demonstration, international standards have been available (TSO C 64 a / SAE AS 8025) for several decades. 	More than the oxygen partial pressure in the trachea, the blood oxygen saturation is the most relevant parameter to characterize the level of oxygenation. Current medical instrumentation are available for measuring directly the blood oxygen saturation. This alternative means of demonstration has been systematically studied during a test campaign at the DLR – Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne with human testing in altitude chamber. Different types of oxygen dispensing devices have been tested at different altitudes. Results show that the oxygenation level required by the regulation is achieved with significantly less oxygen than used so far. This is explained by the different efficiency level of oxygen transfer to the blood during the different phases of the breathing process. In other words, {{it is important to}} deliver oxygen at the right time, so that oxygen is effectively transferred to the blood and not “wasted” during subsequent exhalation. In the last years, this alternative means of compliance has been accepted by the Airworthiness Authorities. This has opened possibilities to introduce new technologies in oxygen dispensing equipment and {{to reduce the amount of}} oxygen to be transported on-board. These different opportunities are shortly presented and discussed. ...|$|E
