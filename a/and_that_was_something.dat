500|$|After co-starring on 2004's {{fourth season}} of The Shield on cable network FX, Close told network {{president}} John Landgraf {{that she would}} be open to star in another series, suggesting a spin-off for her Shield character, Captain Monica Rawling. Landgraf pitched Damages to Close, who agreed to play Patty so long as the series was shot in New York City, where she resides. To prepare for her role, Close met New York attorney Mary Jo White and her partner Lorna Scoffield, as well as litigator Patricia Hines, from whom Close learned [...] "some extraordinary things". The producers sought after Byrne to play Ellen, but she was unavailable during the first round of auditions as she was filming 28 Weeks Later. She says the opportunity [...] "came up again, so I went in, auditioned, and got the role". Like Close, Byrne spent time with a female lawyer in New York and read books written by litigators Alan Dershowitz and David DuBois, while Donovan talked to his uncle, a New York corporate lawyer. He visited Manhattan's Centre Street courts, where he [...] "followed the most intense murder trial". Ivanek was so eager to work on the series that he auditioned for two different roles, and was cast as Ray. Todd Kessler said that Danson's 1979 film The Onion Field was [...] "a huge influence on Glenn, Daniel and myself, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that had always stuck in our minds. And when we sought out to cast this role of Arthur Frobisher, Ted kind of came into focus." [...] In preparation for his role, the producers asked Danson to meet with CEOs of Fortune 500 corporations and watch documentaries such as , which examines the collapse of Enron. They also suggested that Danson meet with Close's acting coach Harold Guskin. The producers said that David and Katie were the hardest characters to cast. Noah Bean, who felt that he gave [...] "an awful first audition" [...] for the role of David, was called in for a second reading as he was waiting for an elevator to leave the building, and was ultimately cast. British actress Anastasia Griffith's agent informed her of the audition for the role of Katie only two hours before it began. When she met the producers, they were initially concerned about a Brit playing an American, especially since Australian Byrne had already signed on. [...] "To put their fears at rest", Griffith addressed the producers in an American accent from beginning to end of the audition. After being cast, Griffith and Byrne visited New York University dialect coach Deborah Hecht to perfect their accents.|$|E

But I believe that Otto Robert Frisch and I contributed something not insignificant to the clarification {{of the process of}} uranium fission—how it originates and that it produces so much energy <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> very remote to Hahn." [...] In a similar vein, Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, Lise Meitner's former assistant, later added that Hahn [...] "certainly did deserve this Nobel Prize. He would have deserved it even if he had not made this discovery. But everyone recognized that the splitting of the atomic nucleus merited a Nobel Prize." [...] Frisch wrote similarly in a 1955 letter.|$|E

2500|$|After scoring both Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World, Brian Tyler {{was rumored}} {{for several months}} to be scoring The Avengers sequel , before officially signing on to the film in March 2014. He said that his {{template}} for the film was game changing scores such as those for Star Wars, Superman, and Raiders of the Lost Ark, feeling that [...] "You have to build in nostalgia and do it upfront so you can relate to it." [...] In February 2015, Danny Elfman was revealed to have composed additional music for the score, ultimately receiving co-composer credit. On working with Elfman, Tyler said, [...] "The movie is such a large canvas that there were parts that really benefited from his kind of voice. But also, it needed to all fit together and hang together seamlessly, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> we worked really hard on doing." [...] Tyler and Elfman strove to orchestrate, record, and mix their music similarly. Tyler wrote much more quiet and emotional music for Age of Ultron [...] "than you would've thought ... you can go deeper in a second movie because in the first movie {{you really have to}} set everyone up". He gave Hulk's farewell to Black Widow, Quicksilver's sacrifice, and the time spent at Hawkeye's farm as examples of this.|$|E

Piper, in her ignorance, informed the Academy staff of Sardas talents, which led to his great personal embarrassment and being ostracized by other Vulcans in Starfleet.

He explains, [...] "when you're that age, you sometimes have a great burning enthusiasm <b>that</b> <b>is</b> very deep <b>and</b> very narrow, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> has always intrigued me - that world of the 11-year-old <b>that</b> <b>is</b> so quickly lost."

If we limit ourselves to the age <b>that</b> we <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> forget all the ages <b>that</b> we have <b>been,</b> we diminish our truth." [...] Later in the same book, she further explains her use of the science fantasy genre: [...] "Writing A Wrinkle in Time... was my first effort in a genre now called 'science fantasy', and science fantasy is not far from fairy tale, that world which delves deep into the human psyche, struggling to find out {{at least a little}} more of what we are all about." ...|$|R

Therefore, for my sake, do no harm to this man who was Baresark, but now is my thrall; and, moreover, I beg the aid and friendship of all men of this quarter in those suits that will be laid against me at the Althing for these slayings, which I hereby give out as done by my hand, and by the hand of Skallagrim Lambstail, the Baresark." ...|$|E
60|$|I, THE SIEUR LOUIS DE CONTE, {{was born}} in Neufchateau, on the 6th of January, 1410; that is to say, exactly two years before Joan of Arc {{was born in}} Domremy. My family had fled to those distant regions from the {{neighborhood}} of Paris {{in the first years}} of the century. In politics they were Armagnacspatriots; they were for our own French King, crazy and impotent as he was. The Burgundian party, who were for the English, had stripped them, and done it well. They took everything but my father's small nobility, and when he reached Neufchateau he reached it in poverty and with a broken spirit. But the political atmosphere there was the sort he liked, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>something.</b> He came to a region of comparative quiet; he left behind him a region peopled with furies, madmen, devils, where slaughter was a daily pastime and no man's life safe for a moment. In Paris, mobs roared through the streets nightly, sacking, burning, killing, unmolested, uninterrupted. The sun rose upon wrecked and smoking buildings, and upon mutilated corpses lying here, there, and yonder about the streets, just as they fell, and stripped naked by thieves, the unholy gleaners after the mob. None had the courage to gather these dead for burial; they were left there to rot and create plagues.|$|E

I was in Parliament, and that she thought to be something. I had a house in Chester Square, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>something.</b> She was promised a carriage, and that conquered her. As the bride I had chosen for myself she became known to many, and then she began to understand that she might have done better with herself. I am old, and not given to many amusements. Then came a man with a better income and with fewer years; and she did not hesitate for a moment. When she took me aside and {{told me that she had}} changed her mind, it was her quiescence and indifference that disturbed me most. There was nothing of her new lover; but simply that she did not love me. I did not stoop for a moment to a prayer. I took her at her word, and left her.

I dare say they were wondering what I was doing up in cloud-land. Suddenly a grey curtain drew across beneath me and the wet folds of vapours were swirling round my face. It was clammily cold and miserable. But I was above the hail-storm, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> gained. The cloud was as dark and thick as a London fog. In my anxiety to get clear, I cocked her nose up until the automatic alarm-bell rang, and I actually began to slide backwards. My sopped and dripping wings had made me heavier than I thought, but presently I was in lighter cloud, and soon had cleared the first layer. There was a second--opal-coloured and fleecy--at a great height above my head, a white, unbroken ceiling above, and a dark, unbroken floor below, with the monoplane labouring upwards upon a vast spiral between them. It is deadly lonely in these cloud-spaces. Once a great flight of some small water-birds went past me, flying very fast to the westwards. The quick whir of their wings and their musical cry were cheery to my ear. I fancy that they were teal, but I am a wretched zoologist. Now that we humans have become birds we must really learn to know our brethren by sight.|$|E
60|$|Very few boys {{ever came}} to have a gun, though they all {{expected}} to have one. But seven or eight boys would go hunting with one shot-gun, and take turn-about shooting; some of the little fellows never got to shoot at all, but they could run and see whether the big boys had hit anything when they fired, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>something.</b> This was my boy's privilege {{for a long time}} before he had a gun of his own, and he went patiently with his elder brother, and never expected to fire the gun, except, perhaps, to shoot the load off before they got back to town; they were not allowed to bring the gun home loaded. It was a gun that was pretty safe for anything in front of it, but you never could tell what it was going to do. It began by being simply an old gun-barrel, which my boy's brother bought of another boy who was sick of it for a fip, as the half-real piece was called, and it went on till it got a lock from one gunsmith and a stock from another, and was a complete gun. But this took time; perhaps a month; for the gunsmiths would only work at it in their leisure; they were delinquent subscribers, and they did it in part pay for their papers. When they got through with it my boy's brother made himself a ramrod out of a straight piece of hickory, or at least as straight as the gun-barrel, which was rather sway-backed, and had a little twist to one side, so that one of the jour printers said it was a first-rate gun to shoot round a corner with. Then he made himself a powder-flask out of an ox-horn that he got and boiled till it was soft (it smelt the whole house up), and then scraped thin with a piece of glass; it hung at his side; and he carried his shot in his pantaloons pocket. He went hunting with this gun for a good many years, but he had never shot anything with it, when his uncle gave him a smooth-bore rifle, and he in turn gave his gun to my boy, who must then have been nearly ten years old.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{publication}} of the final volume of The Balkan Trilogy in 1965, Manning worked on her cat memoir and a collection of short stories, A Romantic Hero and Other Stories, both of which were published in 1967. Another novel, The Play Room (published as The Camperlea Girls in the US), appeared in 1969. The book of short stories and The Play Room both contained homosexual themes, a topic which interested Manning. The latter was a less than successful exploration of the lives and interests of adolescents, though the reviews were generally encouraging. A film version was proposed, and Ken Annakin asked her to write the script. The movie, with more explicit lesbian scenes than the book, was all but made before the money ran out; a second version, with a very different script, was also developed but came to nothing.
