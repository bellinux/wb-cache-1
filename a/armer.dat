He was rested for the next game against Glamorgan, which ended in a rain-affected draw without reaching the second innings. Johnston returned and took 2/41 in the first innings against Warwickshire, before taking 4/32 in the second innings, including three of the last five wickets, as the hosts fell from 5/118 to 155 all out. The left <b>armer</b> bowled almost unchanged during the second innings, sending down 39 of the 85.5 overs, including 16 maidens. His wickets included New Zealand Test batsman Martin Donnelly and Indian and Pakistani dual international Abdul Hafeez Kardar, as Australia went on to win by nine wickets. Johnston was then rested from two consecutive matches, against Lancashire and Durham, both of which were rain-affected draws.|$|E
5|$|With Keith Miller {{injured and}} playing purely as a batsman, Johnston took the new ball, {{sharing it with}} Lindwall. He was unable to take a wicket initially, but the English openers were uncomfortable when he and Lindwall were taking the new ball. Following the tea break, he {{returned}} with the second new ball after Compton and Yardley had put on an 87-run partnership to stabilise the middle-order. Johnston took Compton's outside edge and Miller completed the catch in slips. The left <b>armer</b> then claimed Evans, caught by a diving Miller after the Englishman had taken a swing of the bat wide outside off stump; this left the hosts at 7/145. Johnston ended with 2/43 from 22 overs as England were bowled for at 215 early on the third morning. After Australia declared at 7/460 on the fourth afternoon to leave the home side a target of 596, Johnston troubled the English openers with the new ball, but did not take a wicket.|$|E

40|$|Armerad betong är ett av de vanligaste konstruktionsmaterial vi har. Tack vare armeringen i betongen kan konstruktionen ta upp de dragspänningar som uppstår från både betongens egentyngd och yttre laster. Kostnaderna för en betongkonstruktion beror på flera olika faktorer, <b>armering</b> och armeringsarbetet har ofta en stor ekonomisk betydelse för totalkostnaden för ett byggprojekt. Konstruktörens arbetsuppgift är att {{dimension}}era betongelementet och se till att dragkraftsbehovet uppfylls. Behovet varierar i hela konstruktionen men vanligtvis dimensioneras betongelementet med samma armeringsmängd som krävs i maxmomentet i hela konstruktionen. Genom att anpassa armeringens dragkraftskapacitet efter dragkraftsbehovet kan dimensioneringsvillkoret uppfyllas med en mindre mängd <b>armering</b> vilket också ger en lägre armeringskostnad. Som konstruktör är noggrannare uträkningar ofta uteslutet på grund av tidspress. Att kunna anpassa armeringen i konstruktionen är en möjlighet som konstruktörer har men det kräver desto mer arbetstid. Konstruktören skulle behöva lägga fler arbetstimmar på att minska mängden <b>armering</b> vilket skulle innebära att entreprenören betalar konstruktören mer för arbetstiden, men sparar mer pengar på material. Detta skulle därmed kunna leda till en ekonomisk vinning både för konstruktör och entreprenör. Vilket leder till frågeställningen: Är det ekonomiskt lönsamt för en konstruktör att dimensionera betongelement med <b>armering</b> anpassad efter dragkraftsbehovet? Målet är att klargöra om det är lönsamt att som konstruktör lägga tid på att minska mängden <b>armering</b> i betongplattor.   En jämförelse av armeringsmängd har gjorts mellan en befintlig dimension utan optimerad <b>armering</b> och en ny dimension med optimerad <b>armering.</b> För att få ett så rättvist resultat som möjligt har ett befintligt projekt valts ut där samma förutsättningar använts. Studien behandlade en pålad betongplatta på 72, 5 m 2. Beräkningar har gjorts för hand på balkarna och för plattan har beräkningsprogrammen FEM-design 3 D-Structure samt Concrete Beam används. Beräkningarna har gjorts enligt normsystemet Eurokoder 2 : Dimensionering av betongkonstruktioner samt Boverkets konstruktionsregler.   Beräkningarna resulterade i att merkostnaden blir 1 450 kr för en betongplatta med optimerad <b>armering.</b> För flera likadana betongplattor sker en besparing då samma ritning kan användas till alla betongplattor. Reinforced concrete {{is one of}} {{the most}} common construction materials we have. Thanks to the steel reinforced concrete, construction can take both the tensile stresses that arise from both the concrete's selfweight and external loads. The cost of a concrete structure depends on several factors; reinforcement and man-hours often have a significant financial impact on the overall cost of a building project. The constructor task is to design the concrete element and ensure that the tensile force requirement is met. The need varies throughout the structure but usually are concrete elements designed with the same amount of reinforcement that required at the maximum torque throughout the structure. By adapting the reinforcement’s tensile force capacity throughout the structure can dimensioning conditions be fulfilled with a smaller amount of reinforcement, which offers a lower reinforcement cost. As a constructor, accurate calculations are often excluded because of time pressure. Being able to customize the reinforcement of the structure is an opportunity that the constructors have but it requires more working hours. The constructor would need to add more hours to reduce the amount of reinforcement, which would mean that the contractor pays the constructor more for working, but saves even more money on materials. This could therefore lead to a financial gain for both the constructor and entrepreneur. Which leads to the question: Is it economically feasible for a constructor to use reinforcement adapted to the draft requirement? The intention is to clarify whether it is profitable to the constructor to spend time reduce the amount of reinforcement in concrete slabs.   A comparison of the amount of reinforcement has been made between an existing dimension without optimized reinforcement and a new dimension with optimized reinforcement. To get such a reasonable result as possible, existing projects have been selected where the same conditions has been used. The study dealt with a piled concrete slab of 72. 5 m 2. Calculations for the beams were made by hand and the slab with the calculation programs FEM Design 3 D Structure and Concrete Beam. The calculations are made according to the standard system Eurocodes 2 : Design of concrete structures and the Board's Design Regulations.   The calculations resulted in additional cost of 1450 SEK for a concrete slab with optimized reinforcement. For many of the same slab is made savings as the same drawing can be used for all concrete slabs...|$|R
25|$|Having been unbeaten {{in their}} first eleven matches, the Australians finally tasted defeat in the twelfth at Lord's when they played the Gentlemen of England, captained by Pelham Warner, 23 to 25 June. The Gentlemen batted first after winning the toss and ran up a total of 402, batting into the second morning. Surprisingly, the Australians {{collapsed}} against the fast-medium pace of Johnny Douglas (four for 34) and Michael Falcon (six for 41) and were bowled out for only 85 in the 35th over. Asked to follow on, the Australians reached 149 for 8 at close of play but were dismissed for 184 in the third morning. Douglas took four for forty this time and the slow left <b>armer</b> Jack White took four for 38. The result was a comprehensive victory for the Gentlemen by an innings and 133 runs.|$|E

Additionally, the arrival of bowlers like Peter Siddle, Ben Hilfenhaus and Doug Bollinger ensured that Lee had to fight for a position in the team. However, he took six wickets in the first innings against the England Lions team in a practice match leading up to the Ashes. Lee was the only bowler to get reverse swing in this match and appeared to be in line for selection for the First Test at Cardiff. However, he picked up a left side strain and a sore rib in this match and he was ruled out of the first three Tests. He was then overlooked for a recall and never played test cricket again, announcing his retirement from test cricket at the beginning of 2010.|$|E

25|$|Yorkshire {{fell from}} champions to seventh and used 25 {{different}} {{players in the}} championship alone. There was future promise in five new caps: wicketkeeper Don Brennan, batsmen Willie Watson and Gerald Smithson, fast bowler Alec Coxon and left arm spinner Johnny Wardle. In addition, future stalwart Ted Lester began his career with three successive centuries and topped the county averages. Future captain Vic Wilson made a few appearances. Brian Sellers captained the team for the final time before handing over to Norman Yardley for the 1948 season. Bill Bowes in his final season topped the bowling averages and received a record benefit. He was supported by Wardle, off spinner Ellis Robinson, seamer Frank Smailes and new pace bowlers Coxon and Ron Aspinall. Yorkshire were hit by the loss through illness, after only four matches, of slow left <b>armer</b> Arthur Booth, who had been their outstanding player in 1946. The batting was generally not up to scratch and relied far too much on one man, the great Len Hutton who, because of Test calls, played in only half of Yorkshire's championship matches. Other players included Harry Crick, Harry Halliday, Freddie Jakeman, Geoffrey Keighley and pace bowler John Whitehead.|$|E
25|$|Nottinghamshire, captained for {{the first}} time by William Sime, drew half of their matches and only the top three had less defeats. They lost Bill Voce early in the season to {{retirement}} and this placed a heavy burden on the remaining pace bowlers Arthur Jepson and Harold Butler. They did well, both taking over 100 wickets and Butler being picked for England, but they lacked support. The only other bowler to make any kind of impression was slow left <b>armer</b> Harry Winrow who took 56 championship wickets. Winrow was one of five batsmen to score 1,000 runs. The best of these by a distance was England's Joe Hardstaff junior who had an outstanding season, scoring 2,396 with seven centuries. Walter Keeton, Reg Simpson and Tom Reddick all topped 1,000 runs while Charles Harris was approaching the landmark when his season was ended early by illness. Wicketkeeper Eric Meads claimed 52 victims in championship matches. Cambridge University captain Guy Willatt batted well when available and young Peter Harvey, leg break and googly bowler, looked a good prospect, but Freddie Stocks did not fulfil the promise he showed in 1946. Nottinghamshire made exclusive use of their headquarters at Trent Bridge in Nottingham for their thirteen home matches.|$|E
25|$|The Adelaide Oval {{is usually}} a flat, lifeless wicket where the fastest bowlers could rarely get the ball to rise above knee level and looked fit for a {{thousand}} runs. Freddie Brown won the toss and sent Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook out the bat. The Yorkshireman was back at 31/1 {{and said that the}} wicket was turning so much that they would be lucky to make 250. He wasn't just saving his blushes as the fast-medium seamer Geoff Noblet took 5/54 in the searing heat and Slow Left <b>Armer</b> John Wilson 3/39 as the MCC were out for 211 with no batsman making 30 except Washbrook (32) and David Sheppard (32) {{at the start of the}} innings. The heat badly affected the South Australians with only Neil Dansie (44) made any headway as Eric Hollies took 3/16, Roy Tattersall (2/32) and Doug Wright (2/39) and Freddie Brown (1/1) spun them out for 126. Hutton (66) and Washbrook (45) added 112 for the first wicket in the MCC's reply of 220 with the leg-breaks of Allan McLean (5/68) cleaning up the tail after Noblet (3/39) helped remove the first three batsmen. Even so, 306 runs to win was too much for South Australia as they collapsed to 152 all out after being 90/1 with Dansie (42) top scoring again and Wright taking 5/57. This was the MCC's second win over South Australia and their fourth win in a row since the Third Test, so they had high hopes for Adelaide.|$|E
40|$|The {{dominant}} reinforcement used widely for concrete structures is conventional steel bars (rebars). Nevertheless, {{the perpetual}} effort toward evolution and development could not exclude the engineering field, thus new innovative and sophisticated methods are introduced. It is true that, {{due to lack}} of extended regulations and standards, the fibre reinforced concrete (FRC) was limited to non-structural applications. However, the last years the situation is changing rapidly and already the applications of FRC include actual structural members. The subject of the current thesis was a tramway’s track slab from “Sparvag City” project in Stockholm. The aim was to evaluate the track slab, in terms of alternative reinforcing ways. In particular three models were examined; model I – conventional reinforcement, model II – steel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC) and model III – SFRC with conventional reinforcement. The assessment was performed from structural, regulations – compliance, economic and ergonomic perspective. A static linear analysis of the track slab was performed using Abaqus; a finite element analysis (FEA) software. The track slab was subjected only to mechanical loads (selfweight and traffic actions) and thus, the design internal forces were extracted. Thereafter, Eurocode 2 (EN 1992 - 1 - 1, 2004) and Swedish standards for FRC structures (SS 812310 : 2014) were utilized for the reinforcement design of the models. The design was performed in ultimate limit state (ULS), for bending moment and shear resistance, and in serviceability limit state (SLS), for stress limitation and crack control. Model I and III were successfully designed abiding with the respective regulations and requirements, while “only fibres” model was considered valid only for bending moment resistance according to SS 812310 : 2014. Consequently only models I and III were compared with each other. From the economic comparison it was obtained that model I was less expensive than model III, {{but on the other hand}} its construction time was larger. Furthermore model III contained significantly less total rebars’ mass in comparison to model I. This particularity was crucial for the ergonomic assessment. The human factors, that were relevant to the ergonomic assessment, improved the quality of the comparison and the extracted inferences, but also introduced aspects impossible to be put against economic facts as an equal quantity. Thus, there was not a final proposal as the best solution for the thesis subject. Armeringen av betongkonstruktioner domineras av konventionell <b>armering</b> (armeringsjärn). Med den ständiga strävan mot utveckling och förbättring har inom teknikområdet nya innovativa och avancerade metoder introducerats. Det är på grund av bristen på normer, standarder som fiberarmerad betong begränsats till icke- bärande ändamål. Däremot har situationen förändrats under de senaste åren, redan idag kan man se konstruktioner där fiberarmering används till bärande ändamål. Amnet for den aktuella masterexamen var betongplatta i projektet ”Sparvag City” i Stockholm. Syftet var att utvärdera betongplattan, i form av att undersöka alternativa armeringsmöjligheter. I synnerhet undersöktes tre modeller; modell I- konventionellt armerad platta, modell IIstålfiberarmerad platta och modell III stålfiberarmerad platta kombinerad med konventionell <b>armering.</b> Modellernas möjligheter att uppfylla regelverkens krav undersöktes, men de jämfördes även ur ekonomiskt samt ergonomiskt perspektiv. En statisk linjär analys av betongplattan genomfördes i ett finit element program, Abaqus. Betongplattan utsattes för mekanisk belastning (egenvikt samt trafiklast) för vilken dimensionerande krafter extraherats. Därefter användes Eurocode 2 (EN 1992 - 1 - 1, 2004) och den svenska standarden för fiberarmerade betong konstruktioner (SS 812310 : 2014) för vidare konstruktionsberäkningar. Konstruktionsberäkningarna för betongplattan genomfördes i brottgränstillstånd för böjmoment samt tvärkraft, i brukgränsmotståndet undersöktes betongplattan för spänningsbegränsningar samt sprickkontroll. Konstruktionsberäkningarna kunde genomföras för modell I och III med de existerande föreskrifterna och kraven, men modellen med ”endast fibrer” kunde endast dimensionerna för böjmoment enligt SS 812310 : 2014. Därför kunde endast modell I och III fortsättningsvis jämföras med varandra. Från den ekonomiska jämförelsen erhölls det att modellen I var billigare än modell III, men att konstruktionstiden var längre. Dessutom var behoven för konventionell <b>armering</b> (armeringsjärn) betydligt mindre för modell III till skillnad från modell I. Modellernas innehåll av konventionell <b>armering</b> var avgörande för den ergonomiska bedömningen. Den mänskliga faktorn, som var relevanta för den ergonomiska bedömningens, gav jämförelsen av modellerna en annan dimension, där de viktiga mänskliga faktorern...|$|R

It proposes a number {{of research and development}} priorities for achieving improved BNF contributions through integrated soil fertility management, a holistic approach to soil fertility that includes all driving factors and consequences of soil degradation. Although BNF has not proved a solution for strain selection or breeding of host, modest progress has been registered. The technology is economically viable. The environment is at least as limiting on BNF as is the strain and the host. The benefits of BNF are best expressed {{in the context of an}} agronomic management system that addresses other components of the crop, especially P supply, drought stress and frequently, starter N. Selection for BNF capacity under physiological stress has revealed genotypes worth exploiting more fully. Research efforts on BNF in tropical forage legumes indicated that the main constraints to their widespread adoption include a lack of legume persistence, presence of anti-quality factors such as tannins, variable Bradyrhizobium requirements, and a lack of acceptability by farmers. Farmerparticipatory selection of legumes for increased acceptability is needed. Substantial progress was made in creating an organic resource database and using it to construct a decision support system for organic matter management. Analysis of organic resource data indicated a set of critical values of nitrogen, lignin and polyphenol content for predicting the "fertilizer equivalence" of organic inputs.

To further develop the extension system, the Government of Syria ha d been discussing with IFAD a possible large-scale project, and the main objective of p roject TCP/SYR/ 6751 was to provide continuing assistance while this proposed project wa s under discussionA series of nine extension methodology training courses of two month s each were organized for 194 graduates of the agricultural faculty. This training has given the Extension Directorate the possibility of appointing staff trained to work with f <b>armers</b> and assist them in acquiring improved technologies for agricultural and rural develo pment to the newly established Extension Units. Various manuals, `a trainers' guide and audi ovisual aids for extension were prepared by the project for the use of both trainers and trai neesIt was recommended that the boarding capacity of the National Extens ion Training Centre be increased by finishing the so-far-unused rooms. It was also recommended that the services available to trainees be improved, and that the Training Centr e be allocated a special budget for its day-to-day requirements and miscellaneous current expen sesIt was further recommended that the training staff of the Centre be further upgraded by scholarships to undertake advance studies toward an academic degree in extension or adult education, for which purpose they should improve their knowle dge of foreign languages, especially English and French. A better definition of the of ficial status of the training staff would also help improve their performanceFinally, it was important to ensure continued material support to ex tension field programmes, such as adequate transportation, and the availability of the audiovi sual aids and equipment and materials needed, without which extension activities could not be effectively implemente...|$|R
40|$|In these provinces, large {{quantities}} of straw and stovers are availa ble, and these projects investigated how these could be improved through urea and ammonia treat ment, for use as cattle feed. Under project TCP/CPR/ 6768, a mission visited China in late 1987, to assess the situation, and to assist the Government in considering possible follo w-up through donor-funded projects. As {{a result of this}} mission, the further project, TCP/CP R/ 8858, was approved; it was in operation between February 1989 and January 1990 In March and April 1989, consultants in the ammonia treatment of str aw and feeding methods, and feed-stuff analysis, visited China to demonstrate ammoniati on methods, help develop feeding trials, and prepare for a study tour to Norway and Scotland to study straw ammoniation there. The results of the trials were evaluated in April 1990, and training in feed evaluation and ammoniation techniques was given to some 700 participants. The four- month study tour to Scotland and Norway then took placeFeeding trials showed successful weight gain, and indicated the econ omic viability of upgrading straw for cattle feed. Two feed evaluation laboratories, in Hebei and Henan Provinces, were equipped, and made operationalThe project has resulted in the immediate adoption, by small-scale f <b>armers,</b> of the ammoniation technique. Many thousands of tonnes of straw have already been treated on small farms, and an analysis of the situation in Xuztai village in Huyiang Co unty, done over three years, has shown a large {{increase in the number of}} animals kept, and in earnings. It was therefore recommended that farmers be assured a reliable supply of ammoni a or ureaThe number of cattle in both provinces was currently too low to make use of the straw and stover available, and it was recommended that the Government vigor ously pursue policies to stimulate a greater number of cattle at the same time as reso urces are being upgraded. With this development, a larger number of feed evaluation measures wo uld become necessary, and this would help bring greater precision into feeding pract icesIn 1988, a draft project, for the consideration of UNDP, CPR/ 88 / 057, `A Beef Production System Based on the Use of Crop Residues', was prepared.

40|$|Efter introduktionen av Eurokoderna har mängden minimiarmering i betongkonstruktioner ökat. Denna ökning beror på skillnader i metoderna som nu används för att beräkna mängden minimiarmering i olika typer av betongkonstruktioner och de som användes tidigare då BKR var den gällande normen. Minimiarmering används i betongkonstruktioner för att omfördela tvångsdeformationer. I detta arbete undersöks om mängden minimiarmering kan minskas utan att dess huvudsakliga funktion går förlorad. I arbetet har ett antal metoder för att beräkna minimiarmering jämförts för att se hur stora skillnaderna i armeringsmängd blir, varför dessa uppkommer och vilka för- och nackdelar som finns med metoderna. De undersökta metoderna inkluderar den som anges i Eurokod 2, förändringar som gjorts i den tyska nationella bilagan till Eurokod 2 och ett förslag till ändring som presenterats av Hallgren i ett preliminärt arbete.   Resultaten bygger på simuleringar utförda i FEM-programmet Atena där olika typfall undersökts. I typfallen har betongens hållfasthetsklass, tvärsnittsdimension, armeringsdimension, täckande betongskikt och vidhäftningsförutsättning varierats. Armeringsmängden varierades för att motsvara den mängd som krävs vid beräkning enligt de tidigare nämnda metoderna. I alla undersökta fall antas tvärsnittet vara utsatt för ren dragbelastning, vilket är fallet vid krympning. Resultaten från de numeriska simuleringarna visade att en större armeringsmängd ger minskade sprickbredder och ökade möjligheter att omfördela tvångsdeformationer till nya sprickor. Bildandet av nya sprickor sker också vid en mindre krympning. Skillnaderna jämfört med om en mindre armeringsmängd används blir dock i de flesta fall små och mängden <b>armering</b> kan reduceras utan att minimiarmeringens sprickfördelande funktion äventyras. Resultaten från de numeriska simuleringarna användes också för att ta fram ett alternativ som ger en mindre mängd minimiarmering utan att armeringens huvudsakliga funktion försvinner. I detta arbete föreslås en förändring rörande koefficienten k i Eurokod. Förändringen av värdet på koefficienten k gör att mängden erforderlig minimiarmering minskar betydligt vid beräkningar, speciellt för tvärsnitt med en större tvärsnittshöjd. Fler numeriska simuleringar utfördes och det kunde säkerställas att en armeringsmängd motsvarande den som ges med den föreslagna ändringen fungerar för alla undersökta typfall. Endast en liten ökning av sprickbredderna sker.   En undersökning av sprickproblematiken under betongens hållfasthetstillväxtfas har gjorts, och resultaten visar att problem med sprickbildning inte beror på den autogena krympningen eller på uttorkningskrympningen. Endast en liten andel av denna krympning hinner uppnås under de första veckorna, samtidigt som hållfasthetstillväxten sker relativt snabbt. Problem med sprickbildning under denna tidsperiod beror istället på andra faktorer såsom en stor värmeutveckling i betongen, en ojämn uttorkning eller en ojämn temperaturfördelning över tvärsnittet i kombination med tvång. Efter den värmeutveckling som skett i betongen under det första dygnet efter gjutning påbörjas en avsvalningsfas. Under denna kan sprickbildning uppstå i betongen, och denna sprickbildning finns kvar när uttorkningskrympningen senare fortskrider. En jämförelse har även gjorts mellan handberäkningar av karaktäristiska sprickbredder enligt Betongföreningens handbok till Eurokod 2 och sprickbredder utlästa ur resultaten från de numeriska simuleringarna. Resultaten visar att metoden överlag fungerar bra, men att vissa justeringar skulle kunna göras för att anpassa den till mindre värden på betongens krympning. After the {{introduction}} of the Eurocodes, the minimum amount of reinforcement for crack control in concrete structures has increased. This is due to differences in themethods for calculating the minimum amount of reinforcement used in the Eurocodes and in BKR, a standard which was used in Sweden before the Eurocodes. Minimum reinforcement for crack control is used in concrete structures to redistribute the tensile stresses caused by restraint during the shrinkage. This thesis examines if the amount of minimum reinforcement can be reduced without compromising the main functions of the reinforcement. In this thesis a number of methods for calculating the minimum reinforcement has been compared to see how large the differences in the amount of reinforcement are, why they occur and what are {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the different methods. The different methods revised in this thesis are the method in Eurocode 2, the changes made in the German National Annex to the Eurocode 2 method and a method proposed by Hallgren in a preliminary work.   The results are based on simulations performed in the FEM-application Atena where different scenarios were examined. In the investigated scenarios, the strength classes of the concrete, the cross-sectional dimensions, the size of the reinforcement bars, the size of the concrete cover and the bond strength has been varied. The amount of reinforcement in each case has been varied to correspond to the required minimum amount according to the different methods for calculating minimum reinforcement. In all investigated cases, the cross section is assumed to be exposed to pure tensile load, which is the case for shrinkage. The results of the simulations showed that a larger amount of reinforcement reduces the width of the cracks, that a larger amount of small cracks are formed, and that new cracks are formed earlier at a lower shrinkage value. The differences are however in most cases small compared to when a lower amount of reinforcement is used. In other words, a lower amount of reinforcement could be used without compromising the main functions of the minimum reinforcement. The results from the simulations have also been used to obtain an alternative method for calculating the minimum reinforcement that gives a lower amount of reinforcement without compromising the main functions. The proposed change in Eurocode is a modification in the value of the coefficient k. By changing the value of the coefficient k, the amount of required minimum reinforcement is decreased significantly, especially for large crosssection heights. More numerical simulations were performed to ensure that the reinforcement amount according to the proposed change works for all scenarios considered in this thesis. The results showed that the reinforcement were capable of redistributing the tensile stresses caused by restraint. Only a small increase in the crack widths could be observed.   An investigation was conducted to find an explanation to why cracks occur during the first weeks after casting of the concrete. The results show that the problem with cracks occurring during this period is neither due to the autogenous shrinkage nor the drying shrinkage. Only a small share of those types of shrinkage are achieved during the first weeks, and at the same time the concrete strength growth is relatively fast. Instead, the problems with cracks seem to be caused by other factors, such as a large heat development in the concrete during the first day, uneven drying shrinkage or an uneven temperature distribution over the cross section in combination with restraint. Cracks can develop during the first days after casting of the concrete due to the shrinkage that occur when the concrete cools off after the large heat development the first day. These cracks remain when the drying shrinkage continues. A comparison was also made between hand calculations of the characteristic crack widths according to “Betongföreningens handbok till Eurokod 2 ” and the crack widths read out of the results from the numerical simulations. The results showed that the method generally works well, but some minor adjustments could be made to adapt the method to smaller values of concrete shrinkage...|$|R

2500|$|Pat Falken Smith {{replaced}} Marland as head {{writer of}} General Hospital in 1979 since {{he wanted to}} go slower with Luke and Laura's story than Monty had. Smith wrote a controversial rape storyline between Luke and Laura. To prepare for the story, Geary and Francis both met with a social worker before taping the rape scenes. Originally intended to be a brutal attack, Monty rechoreographed the scene's blocking in order for the encounter to come off as a seduction. She also took strong language and violence out of the scenes. General Hospital's music director at the time, Jill Farren Phelps, chose to use the song [...] "Rise", written by Randy Badazz Alpert and Andy <b>Armer,</b> performed by trumpeter Herb Alpert during the rape scene and ensuing scenes that recalled the rape. [...] "Every time Laura thought of the terrible rape by Luke, it was played to evoke that memory," [...] Phelps said. [...] "Consequently, we used it constantly for a while.
