5|$|I {{might have}} adduced for this same purpose the {{differences}} between the races of man, which are so strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>kind,</b> but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous.|$|E
5|$|In mathematics, {{a matrix}} is a {{rectangular}} array of numbers or other data. In physics, a matrix model is <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>kind</b> of physical theory whose mathematical formulation involves {{the notion of}} a matrix in an important way. A matrix model describes the behavior of a set of matrices within the framework of quantum mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Mimesis is also {{employed}} by some predators and parasites to lure their prey. For example, a flower mantis mimics <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>kind</b> of flower, {{such as an}} orchid. This tactic has occasionally been used in warfare, for example with heavily armed Q-ships disguised as merchant ships.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, Pocock {{lists the}} vernacular names ye and nigálya ponya (Nepal); thokya and thongwa (Limbu); oakdonga or wakdonka and woker (Bhotia); saknam sunam (Lepcha). Nigálya may {{originate}} from the Nepali word निङालो niṅālo or nĩgālo meaning <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>kind</b> of small bamboo, namely Arundinaria intermedia, but also {{refers to a}} kind of small leopard, or cat-bear. The word pónya may originate from the Nepali word पञ्जा pajā meaning claw, or पौँजा paũjā meaning paw of an animal. Nigálya pónya may translate to bamboo claw or paw.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive {{resemblance}} {{is used by}} predators or parasites. In special aggressive resemblance, {{the animal}} looks like something else, luring the prey or host to approach, for example when a flower mantis resembles <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>kind</b> of flower, such as an orchid. In general aggressive resemblance, the predator or parasite blends in with the background, for example when a leopard {{is hard to see}} in long grass.|$|E
5|$|Dunster {{had become}} a centre for woollen and {{clothing}} production by the 13th century, with the market dating back to at least 1222, and <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>kind</b> of kersey or broadcloth became known as 'Dunsters'.

40|$|If {{groups are}} to prove capable of {{possessing}} and increasing their knowledge, {{then they will}} need to be capable of revising their beliefs. While the nature of collective knowledge has begun to receive more attention in recent years, surprisingly little work has been done on the process of belief revision that makes it possible. And that which has been done has focused on <b>a</b> very <b>particular</b> <b>kind</b> of community and <b>a</b> very <b>particular</b> <b>kind</b> of knowledge, namely the scientific community and scientific knowledge. This paper aims to extend the analysis of collective belief revision to a different sort of community and a different sort of knowledge, namely, moral communities and moral knowledge. The chapter will suggest that, whatever one’s preferred account of what groups know, we need a richer account of belief revision to support it than has been offered thus far.

5|$|In folk-stories, Scandinavian elves often {{play the}} role of disease-spirits. The most common, though also most {{harmless}} case was various irritating skin rashes, which were called älvablåst (elven puff) and could be cured by a forceful counter-blow (a handy pair of bellows was most useful for this purpose). Skålgropar, <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>kind</b> of petroglyph (pictogram on a rock) found in Scandinavia, were known in older times as älvkvarnar (elven mills), because it was believed elves had used them. One could appease the elves by offering them a treat (preferably butter) placed into an elven mill.|$|E
5|$|As {{literary}} studies {{developed into a}} discipline {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century, the story of the origins of Romanticism in England emerged along with it; according to this version of literary history, Coleridge and Wordsworth were the dominant poets of the age. This view held sway for almost a century. Even with the advent of feminist criticism in the 1970s, Barbauld still did not receive her due. As Margaret Ezell explains, feminist critics wanted to resurrect <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>kind</b> of woman—one who was angry, one who resisted the gender roles of her time, and one who attempted to create a sisterhood with other women. Barbauld did not easily fit into these categories and it was not until Romanticism and its canon began to be re-examined through a deep reassessment of feminism itself that a picture emerged of the vibrant voice Barbauld had been.|$|E

The prosperity of Dunster {{was based on the}} wool trade, with profits helping to pay for the construction of the tower of the Priory Church of St George and provide other amenities. By the 15th century the importance of the town was declining particularly due to the silting up of the harbour. The Luttrell's wanted to maintain the importance as a market and in 1609 George Luttrell, of the Luttrell family constructed the market to shelter traders and their wares from the rain and provide more security for their wares. The exact date of construction is debated and a variety of dates are given in different sources, however 1609 is considered the most likely.|$|E

Keywords: Active databases, coordination protocols, task sharing. 1 Introduction We belive that applications developed within the frameworks of Cooperative Information Systems [14] and Cooperative Information Agents [15] {{will have to deal}} with techniques from both distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) and database management systems. The need for DAI techniques is apparent in many different areas today. One typical system is the automation of an office environment. Such an environment usually consists of several problem solving agents (PSAs) with specialized talents to solve <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>kinds</b> of problem. The PSAs can be either humans or computing systems. Obviously there are many com [...] ...|$|R

We consider gene tagging under the most relevant biological constraints: protein encoding preservation with and without codon count preservation. We show that our finite and deterministic combinatorial results are asymptotically—as the length of the gene increases— particular cases of the stochastic Gel’fand and Pinsker capacity formula for communications with side information at the encoder, which lies at the foundations of data hiding theory. This is because gene tagging is <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> case of DNA watermarking...|$|R

25|$|In general, {{the meaning}} of a {{compound}} noun is a specialization of {{the meaning of}} its head. The modifier limits the meaning of the head. This is most obvious in descriptive compounds (known as karmadharaya compounds in the Sanskrit tradition), in which the modifier is used in an attributive or appositional manner. A blackboard is <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>kind</b> of board, which is (generally) black, for instance.|$|E
25|$|Relative species {{abundance}} is {{a component}} of biodiversity and refers to how common or rare a species is relative to other species in a defined location or community.

25|$|This means, essentially, that {{substance}} is just whatever {{can be thought}} of without relating it to any other idea or thing.

Substance, on the other hand, is to be conceived of by itself, without understanding it as <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>kind</b> of thing (because it isn't a particular thing at all).|$|E

Selective bleaching and toning (often done by brush) add depth to his palette of grays.

Nonetheless, in order to emphasize the dramatic aspects of the City of Shadows series, he sometimes uses the Sabattier effect called the Mackie line.|$|R
