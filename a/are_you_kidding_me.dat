5000|$|... ==Background== In March 2016, {{six years}} {{following}} her {{departure from the}} label, {{it was announced that}} Lopez had returned to Epic Records and Sony Music Entertainment, signing a multi-album deal with the label. She had released two albums under the Universal Music Group, Love? (2011) via Island Records and A.K.A. (2014) via Capitol Records. Lopez, who had been working on music in the midst of her Las Vegas residency, confirmed that she would be releasing new material: [...] "I’ve been working on music {{for the past couple of}} months, and we should be putting something out very soon." [...] "Ain't Your Mama" [...] is the first single Lopez released since resigning with Epic, and is expected to precede her ninth studio album. Co-writer Meghan Trainor who texted Lopez the song said, [...] "I sent it to her and said, ’Do you like the song?’ and she said, ’I love the song, my kid loves the song — he’s made me play it five times already so I know it’s a hit. When can I cut it?’, so I said immediately, ’Whenever you want!'" [...] Lopez described the concept behind [...] "Ain't Your Mama" [...] as [...] "very empowering", and explained: [...] "Guys have this tendency, once they love you in the beginning and you're the hottest woman on Earth, and then all of a sudden, it's like, 'Okay... where's my food?' It's like, 'What!? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>kidding</b> <b>me?</b> Take me out! What are you doing right now?'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Much of {{the rest}} of the album deals with {{political}} issues in the United States as well. Jeff Miers of The Buffalo News calls the album [...] "a response to the oppressive vacuousness of the Bush years". Dealing with specific tracks on the album, AllMusic states that Rise Against [...] "rages against the moral decay rotting the core of the U.S. on the opening 'Collapse (Post-Amerika),' just as they strike out against the slow dumbing down of America on 'Re-Education (Through Labor)'". McIlrath said in an interview with The Red Alert, [...] "All of our songs are 'that' song that we won't dilute. They always have been. I've never written a song, until [...] "Hero of War," [...] with a specific goal in mind." [...] When asked about how Appeal to Reason continues Rise Against's tradition of making politically charged music, he said: [...] "The reason I started this band, and the reason I still do it, is that I still open a paper and say, [...] "Holy Shit! <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>kidding</b> <b>me?</b> Is this really happening? Are people voting for things like Proposition 8? Is this America? Are we still in Iraq and in a place that people think a white versus a black president is a big deal?" [...] There is so much to address through music. There is plenty we need to learn from." [...] Nevertheless, the band has stated that their songs don't only focus on politics. In one interview, Principe said, [...] "The political side of this band is just that -- it's a side. There are political lyrics. There are social awareness and there are lyrics about the environment. I think if people take the time to read the lyrics, they'll know we're not strictly force feeding you our politics." ...|$|E

I don't think they're going to think this is really so cool. Do you think you're going to have trouble shooting there?” He said, “Are <b>you</b> <b>kidding?</b> It's <b>me</b> and Steve." [...] Months later they called and said, “We can't shoot in India. They're really upset.” So they shot in Sri Lanka and London, mostly.” ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the liner}} notes to Time Signatures Brubeck wrote, [...] "For {{the first few}} years the quartet played almost all standards, until one day Paul Desmond said to me, 'We've got to hire {{somebody}} to write some material for us.' I said, 'Paul, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>kidding?</b> I'll write two tunes in half an hour!' I wrote 'In Your Own Sweet Way' and 'The Waltz' that night. From then on we started doing my material a lot more." ...|$|R
