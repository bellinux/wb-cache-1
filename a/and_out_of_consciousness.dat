5|$|July 9, 1861 {{was a hot}} day, and Fanny {{was putting}} locks of her children's hair into an {{envelope}} and attempting to seal it with hot sealing wax while Longfellow took a nap. Her dress suddenly caught fire, though it is unclear exactly how; burning wax or a lighted candle may have fallen onto it. Longfellow was awakened from his nap and rushed to help her, throwing a rug over her, though it was too small. He stifled the flames with his body as best he could, but she was already badly burned. Over half a century later, Longfellow's youngest daughter Annie explained the story differently, claiming {{that there had been}} no candle or wax but that the fire had started from a self-lighting match that had fallen on the floor. Both accounts state that Fanny was taken to her room to recover and a doctor was called. She was in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> throughout the night and was administered ether. She died shortly after 10:00 the next morning, July 10, after requesting a cup of coffee. Longfellow, in trying to save her, had burned himself badly enough so that he was unable to attend her funeral. His facial injuries led him to stop shaving, and he wore a beard from then on that became his trademark.|$|E

5|$|In September 1990, Dugard and {{her family}} moved from the Los Angeles County city of Arcadia, to Meyers, a rural town south of South Lake Tahoe, California, because {{they thought it was}} a safer community. At the time of the abduction, Dugard was in the fifth grade and, because of her shyness, was {{worrying}} about an upcoming field trip. She was close to her mother, Terry Probyn, and her infant half sister Shayna who was born in 1990. Her biological father, Ken Slayton, did not know he had fathered a child. Although her mother married a man named Carl Probyn, Dugard was never close to her stepfather. On June 10, 1991, Dugard's mother, who worked as a typesetter at a print house, left for work early in the day. Eleven-year-old Dugard, wearing her favorite all-pink outfit, walked up the hill from her house, against traffic, to catch the school bus. When she was halfway up the hill, a car approached her. She thought that the man in the car would ask for directions. When he rolled down the window, he shocked her unconscious with a stun gun and abducted her. The man was Phillip Greg Garrido. Nancy, who the District Attorney in the Dugard case believes scouted Dugard as a prize for Garrido, held Dugard down in the car as she drifted in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> during the three hour drive from her home to the Garrido home in Antioch.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Despite the otherwise-dominant trends towards phys-icalism and naturalism in philosophy, it {{has become}} {{increasingly}} common for metaphysicians to accept the existence either of modal facts and properties, or of Lewisian possible worlds. This paper raises the historical question: why did these heavyweight realist views come into prominence? The answer is that they have arisen in response to the demand to find truthmakers for our modal state-ments. But this demand presupposes that modal statements are descriptive claims in need of truthmakers. This presupposition was, however, rejected by many earlier analytic philosophers, in-cluding the logical positivists, Wittgenstein, Ryle and Sellars, all of whom denied that (at least certain kinds of) modal statement were descriptive at all. Yet the non-descriptivist approach has largely fallen <b>out</b> <b>of</b> discussion <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> philosophical <b>consciousness.</b> In this paper I examine why non-descriptivist views first came into <b>and</b> then fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favor, <b>and</b> consider what the prospects are for reviving this more deflationary approach to modality...|$|R
40|$|Nursing defines {{its role}} as the {{treatment}} of patient 2 ̆ 7 s responses to health problems. If patient 2 ̆ 7 s responses are {{a function of the}} meanings from these experiences, nursing care can be tailored to the critically ill only if the nurse can link an individual 2 ̆ 7 s meaning with response as patients float in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> However, a dearth of information exists investigating this phenomena. ^ This study described how patients make sense of their ICU experience, the content of this process, resultant responses and factors which affected process, content, and patient responses. The theoretical framework blended neurophysiological and symbolic interaction perspectives. ^ The participant observation included interviewing and case study approach with intra-case, inter-case and inter-group analysis. Nine patients were followed twice daily through their ICU stays. Follow-up interviewing ensued. ^ Patients responded in phylogenetically, hierarchically ordered information processing modes. Making sense was tied to factors affecting patient level <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> such as drugs and acuity of illness. Based on Glascow Coma Scale (GCS), three groups emerged: 2 ̆ 2 non-alerts 2 ̆ 2 (GCS 3 ̆c 9), 2 ̆ 2 ins <b>and</b> <b>outs</b> 2 ̆ 2 (GCS 3 - 14), and 2 ̆ 2 alerts 2 ̆ 2 (GCS 13 - 15). ^ Below a GCS score of 9, thinking was nonexistent. At 9 to 12, thinking was limited to 2 ̆ 2 here and now 2 ̆ 2 with no active defining. Responses were essentially physiological. From 13 to 15, defining transpired characterized by self-interaction or symbolic interaction. Movement from self- to symbolic interaction was affected by time orientation, exhaustion, environmental awareness and interactional factors. Defining processes existed isolated from patients. ^ Content included physiological and psychosocial concerns. Embedded were non-crisis orientation, spiritual, and family based meanings. Patients delimited progress differently from staff and family. Post-ICU memory was scant. ^ Content demarcated a meaning typology transcending group membership. The classification was spatiotemporally dependent, moving from physiologically-based patient concerns to environmental awareness to future orientation. Transition times were individualistic. ^ Symbolic interaction had limited but useful explanatory power. Recommendations included facilitation of mutual defining among staff, family and patient and tailoring of nursing care to emergent meanings, physiological and psychological patient responses. ...|$|R
50|$|Much of Last Post is {{presented}} from Mark’s {{point of view}} as he lies, mute and immobile, in an outdoor shelter; other sections are presented from the viewpoints of Marie Léonie and Valentine Wannop. The narrative also dips in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>consciousnesses</b> <b>of</b> Sylvia Tietjens, her son Mark Tietjens Junior, and several minor characters. These interior monologues traverse the past, speculate on the future, illuminate details of the present situation and review past events, particularly ‘that infernal day’ and ‘that dreadful night’ of the Armistice, around which {{the memories of the}} major characters circle obsessively. Others tensions arise from the pregnant Valentine’s painful awareness of her unmarried status and the precarious financial state in which she and Christopher are placed. Most immediately, {{this is due to the}} failure of Christopher’s US-based partner in the antiques business to pay the money that he owes. But more importantly, it is due to the feud between Christopher and his immensely wealthy brother, a feud brought about by Sylvia’s promotion of scurrilous rumours about her husband, which were initially believed by Mark and, consequently, by their father. In Christopher’s eyes, this makes it impossible for him to accept, either by gift or by inheritance, money or property from his brother.The threats to the Tietjens ménage derive directly or indirectly from the continued malicious scheming of Sylvia, who has tried to turn their neighbour and landlord against them, and manoeuvred an American tenant of Groby (the Tietjens ancestral home) into cutting down Groby Great Tree, ‘the symbol of Tietjens’.|$|R

40|$|Don’t {{know what}} you’ve got ‘till it’s gone; they’ve paved paradise, {{and put up}} a parking lot. ”-Joni Mitchell During lunch one {{afternoon}} {{in the fall of}} 1990, retired New York Times reporter A.

40|$|Maritime themes {{have long}} been {{established}} in both Neolithic and Early Bronze Age research in England. From Crawford’s (1912) identification of the western seaways as a critical conduit for prehistoric communication, through Childe’s (1946, 36) description of those seaways as ‘grey waters bright with Neolithic Argonauts’, to Case’s (1969) seminal paper on the mechanics of moving domesticated cereals and animals from the continent to Britain. This early archaeological awareness {{of the importance of}} maritime activity is not surprising if we pause to remind ourselves of the island nature of the British Isles. However, since the early works of Crawford and Childe, maritime themes have dipped in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> scholarly <b>consciousness,</b> as archaeology oscillates between large scale grand narratives and small scale accounts. In this process of switching focus, all too often maritime themes have slipped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> view. Oxley (2005, 1) has suggested that a major reason for this is the development of an unfortunate divide between maritime and terrestrial archaeology over the last thirty years. This has resulted in compartmentalisation of research questions where in fact there needs to be integration. As such, although this review sits within a maritime research framework, it makes a deliberate effort to integrate research themes and concerns from the broader sweep of Neolithic and Early Bronze Age studies.

40|$|Distant {{vestiges of}} memory incite my art making. By {{examining}} my biographical past through various scopes, I can extract key memory perceptions for further investigation. In my work, I physically construct models of memories to correlate {{to the mental}} process of memory reconstruction. The very nature of memory is devoid of a logical progression or stability. Imagery loses clarity, moving in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> our <b>consciousness.</b> The memories often become muddled creating passages that can be fleshed out by intuitive impulses. Therefore, the structure is built to contain the fleeting memories so I can extract meaning from them. Individually crafting all aspects of a memory in multiple dimensions unearths intricacy and produces a complex and rich narrative. Photographing the models as the final step alters the scale and flattens the image, creating a documentation of reality. The viewer must then question {{the origins of the}} imagery presented and draw conclusions about its purpose. The use of photography in this instance also functions as film. The images are presented as fragments of a larger scope of memory that has no definitive beginning or end, and the use of a film still draws focus to a particular moment in the elapsing of a memory. The photographs are informed by the history of film, particularly Film Noir and French New Wave—those references are synchronized with corresponding film theories that determine my technical choices in composing the shots. For example, the French New Wave upset the traditional conventions of story-telling in order to access a new facet of reality. I deviate from a linear narrative and instead favor upsetting the chronology of memory. I create a new dimension of reality by allowing a singular memory to converse and interact with historical and cultural narratives. Through this process of visual reconstruction, a unique perspective of realism is crafted. This new realism functions to revive and reinterpret the dormant memories of my childhood in Pennsylvania to contemplate their contemporary meaning...|$|R
40|$|Recent studies (e. g. Kuyken & Brewin, 1994 a) {{have noted}} the {{presence}} of high levels of disturbing intrusive memories in depressed women. Intrusive memories are {{best known as a}} post-traumatic symptom and have received considerable attention from researchers in this field. The presence of a post-traumatic symptom in depression indicates that trauma models might be useful in refining our understanding and treatment of depression. Predictions based on theories of post-traumatic processing were tested in relation to the intrusive memories of a sample of 26 depressed women. The women showed a pattern of intrusive memory experiences which indicate that their memories are likely to be traumatic in nature. The equal availability of childhood and adulthood memories to depressed women contrasts the pattern observed in the 12 control participants, and in other non-clinical samples (e. g. Berntsen, 1996), and is interpreted as lending support to theoretical models of depression which emphasise the importance of childhood experiences to adult depression. The coping strategies deployed to deal with negative intrusive memories were assessed in both groups. The clinical group showed greater use of avoidant coping than controls, in line with predictions derived from the literature regarding coping and depression. The predictive power of coping style for outcome of depression and intrusion was tested by following up 20 of the 26 depressed participants, approximately four months after initial assessment. The data indicate that the use of approach coping, specifically of Positive Reappraisal, in relation to intrusive memories was significantly predictive of better outcome of depression. This finding is interpreted in the context of psychodynamic models of depression. The data also indicate that the use of avoidant coping, specifically of Cognitive Avoidance, is significantly predictive of the maintenance of disturbing intrusions. This finding is interpreted in the context of traumatic processing models. Finally, predictions based on the conceptualisation of dissociation as an avoidant coping mechanism, used to keep traumatic affects <b>and</b> experiences <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> were tested. Dissociation did not show the pattern of associations predicted, but rather seemed to be more closely allied with passive resignation than active avoidance. The pattern of results obtained in this study are interpreted as lending support to the conceptualisation of depression as a trauma-related disorder, and also as lending support to theoretical models which assign great importance to childhood experiences in the aetiology of adult disorder. Potential implications of the study for clinical practice are discussed, and suggestions made for future research.

6000|$|It was advertised {{to begin}} at half-past two o'clock of a certain Saturday, and punctually at the stroke of the hour, from my room across a wide court, I heard a sudden {{multiplication}} of sounds and confusion of tongues in the Corso. I was writing to a friend for whom I cared more than for any mere romp; but as the minutes elapsed and the hubbub deepened curiosity {{got the better of}} affection, and I remembered that I was really within eye-shot of an affair the fame of which had ministered to the daydreams of my infancy. I used to have a scrap-book with a coloured print of the starting of the bedizened wild horses, and the use of a library rich in keepsakes and annuals with a frontispiece commonly of a masked lady in a balcony, the heroine of a delightful tale further on. Agitated by these tender memories I descended into the street; but I confess I looked in vain for a masked lady who might serve as a frontispiece, in vain for any object whatever that might adorn a tale. Masked and muffled ladies there were in abundance; but their masks were of ugly wire, perfectly resembling the little covers placed upon strong cheese in German hotels, and their drapery was a shabby water-proof with the hood pulled over their chignons. They were armed with great tin scoops or funnels, with which they solemnly shovelled lime <b>and</b> flour <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bushel-baskets <b>and</b> down on the heads {{of the people in the}} street. They were packed into balconies all the way along the straight vista of the Corso, in which their calcareous shower maintained a dense, gritty, unpalatable fog. The crowd was compact in the street, and the Americans in it were tossing back confetti <b>out</b> <b>of</b> great satchels hung round their necks. It was quite the [...] "you're another" [...] sort of repartee, and less seasoned than I had hoped with the airy mockery tradition hangs about this festival. The scene was striking, in a word; but somehow not as I had dreamed of its being. I stood regardful, I suppose, but with a peculiarly tempting blankness of visage, for in a moment I received half a bushel of flour on my too-philosophic head. Decidedly it was an ignoble form of humour. I shook my ears like an emergent diver, and had a sudden vision of how still and sunny and solemn, how peculiarly and undisturbedly themselves, how secure from any intrusion less sympathetic than one's own, certain outlying parts of Rome must just then be.

[...] The helicopter, which was unable to operate in the darkness, was forced to return to base at nightfall with Hudner, leaving Brown behind. Brown is believed to have died shortly thereafter of his injuries and exposure to the extreme cold. No Chinese forces threatened the site, likely owing to the heavy air presence of Brown and Hudner's unit.|$|E
500|$|On 17 September 1950 {{a pair of}} Grumman F9F-2 Panthers {{launched}} from the deck of [...] Philippine Sea. VF-112 Ensign Edward D. Jackson Jr. was leading a section [...] dispatched to strafe an airfield near North Korea's capital, Pyongyang. Flying on his wing was Ensign Dayl E. Crow. The airfield {{turned out to be}} little more than a grass strip littered with burned and shattered Soviet-built war machines. After strafing a locomotive and setting it ablaze, the jets turned north and started down the Han River. Soon, Jackson spotted about 75 river boats. When they starting receiving small arms fire from [...] "passengers" [...] on the vessels, Crow followed Jackson down as they made a low strafing pass, splintering many of the small craft with 20mm cannon fire. After the pass both attackers started to climb from [...] AGL. Jackson then flew through an aerial booby trap: steel cables strung across the Han to [...] "clothesline" [...] low flying planes. The Panther ripped through the cables like twine, but the whipsawing cable strands caught the starboard wing, shredded the wingtip tank and snapped across the canopy, punching out the windscreen and side windows. The impact knocked Jackson unconscious with severe facial injuries. Crow, flying just astern noticed something wrong, then saw the crushed wing tank and shattered canopy, its inner surface misted with blood. After 20 seconds Jackson regained consciousness and found himself blinded by shards of Plexiglas and blood. Crow was able to guide his leader towards the Yellow Sea, but Jackson was fading in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> With only the left flap down due to damage to the right wing the Panther approached the ship {{and with the help of}} LSO Lt.j.g."Les" [...] Bruestle and Crow the blind pilot trapped the #4 wire on the first attempt. Jackson survived with 36 stitches and an emergency blood transfusion.|$|E
500|$|Pete (Pemberton), a new mark, enters, but the prank {{does not}} {{work as well as}} with Tina. Among other problems, Pete swears too much and does not seem {{affected}} by the atmosphere, while cues are missed by the pranksters. Terry is surprised to hear a child's voice during Anne's performance as Madam Talbot, and, backstage, the camera stream is blurry. When [...] "Blue Demon Dwarf" [...] appears, Pete punches him, and the production crew rush in. The extra drifts in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> before Gemma—having covered her face in blue paint after giving mouth-to-mouth—says he has died. Backstage, people wait for the police and ambulance; Terry is worried about his career, Anne wants to get away for some food and Amanda is keen to retrieve props from the corpse, but Pete and Gemma show some remorse. When alone, Terry looks to the camera feed and sees the extra standing in the séance room, and, relieved, runs to see him. Facing away from Terry and speaking in a rasping voice, the figure introduces himself as [...] "Spirit of Little Boy", and talks of a suicide after the embarrassment of wetting himself on television. After speaking to the [...] "boy", Terry believes that he himself is on Scaredy Cam, but no one is watching from backstage. When he touches the figure, the extra collapses, but a child's voice continues to shout. A corpse-like child (Wall) begins to rise from the cot used for Madam Talbot's doll. Backstage, Gemma and a police officer look for Terry. They find him in the séance room; he has wet himself, and insists that he is on Scaredy Cam. The child's face appears on the camera feed.|$|E
60|$|The gorse bushes {{on either}} hand were dark, {{but a few}} sparks of flowers showed yellow. He noticed them almost unconsciously as he waited, in the lull. He was in his shirt-sleeves, and the air came chill on his arms. Again his shirt was slit on the shoulders, and the flesh showed through. He was dirty and unkempt. But his face was quiet. So many things go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> before {{we come to the}} end <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b>|$|R
60|$|If I were {{speaking}} of things however weighty, that were long past and dwindled in the memory, I should scarcely venture {{to use this}} language; but the feelings are of yesterday--they are of to-day; the flower, a melancholy flower it is! is still in blow, nor will, I trust, its leaves be shed through months that are to come: for I repeat that {{the heart of the}} nation is in this struggle. This just and necessary war, as we have been accustomed to hear it styled {{from the beginning of the}} contest in the year 1793, had, some time before the Treaty of Amiens, viz. after the subjugation of Switzerland, and not till then, begun to be regarded by the body of the people, as indeed both just and necessary; and this justice and necessity were by none more clearly perceived, or more feelingly bewailed, than by those who had most eagerly opposed the war in its commencement, and who continued most bitterly to regret that this nation had ever borne a part in it. Their conduct was herein consistent: they proved that they kept their eyes steadily fixed upon principles; for, though there was a shifting or transfer of hostility in their minds as far as regarded persons, they only combated the same enemy opposed to them under a different shape; and that enemy was the spirit of selfish tyranny and lawless ambition. This spirit, the class of persons of whom I have been speaking, (and I would now be understood, as associating them with an immense majority of the people of Great Britain, whose affections, notwithstanding all the delusions which had been practised upon them, were, in the former part of the contest, for a long time on the side of their nominal enemies,) this spirit, when it became undeniably embodied in the French government, they wished, in spite of all dangers, should be opposed by war; because peace was not to be procured without submission, which could not but be followed by a communion, of which the word of greeting would be, on the one part, insult,--and, on the other, degradation. The people now wished for war, as their rulers had done before, because open war between nations is a defined and effectual partition, and the sword, in the hands of the good and the virtuous, is the most intelligible symbol of abhorrence. It was in order to be preserved from spirit-breaking submissions--from the guilt of seeming to approve that which they had not the power to prevent, <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a <b>consciousness</b> <b>of</b> the danger that such guilt would otherwise actually steal upon them, and that thus, by evil communications and participations, would be weakened and finally destroyed, those moral sensibilities and energies, by virtue of which alone, their liberties, and even their lives, could be preserved,--that the people of Great Britain determined to encounter all perils which could follow in the train of open resistance.--There were some, and those deservedly of high character in the country, who exerted their utmost influence to counteract this resolution; nor did they give to it so gentle a name as want of prudence, but they boldly termed it blindness and obstinacy. Let them be judged with charity! But there are promptings of wisdom from the penetralia of human nature, which a people can hear, though the wisest of their practical Statesmen be deaf towards them. This authentic voice, the people of England had heard and obeyed: and, in opposition to French tyranny growing daily more insatiate and implacable, they ranged themselves zealously under their Government; though they neither forgot nor forgave its transgressions, in having first involved them in a war with a people then struggling for its own liberties under a twofold infliction--confounded by inbred faction, and beleagured by a cruel and imperious external foe. But these remembrances did not vent themselves in reproaches, nor hinder us from being reconciled to our Rulers, when a change or rather a revolution in circumstances had imposed new duties: and, in defiance of local and personal clamour, it may be safely said, that the nation united heart and hand with the Government in its resolve to meet the worst, rather than stoop its head to receive that which, it was felt, would not be the garland but the yoke of peace. Yet it was an afflicting alternative; and it is not to be denied, that the effort, if it had the determination, wanted the cheerfulness of duty. Our condition savoured too much of a grinding constraint--too much of the vassalage of necessity;--it had too much of fear, and therefore of selfishness, not to be contemplated in the main with rueful emotion. We desponded though we did not despair. In fact a deliberate and preparatory fortitude--a sedate and stern melancholy, which had no sunshine and was exhilarated only by the lightnings of indignation--this was the highest and best state of moral feeling to which the most noble-minded among us could attain.|$|R
