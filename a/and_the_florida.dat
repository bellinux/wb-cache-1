50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Florida</b> Brothers were {{a comedy}} team. Their routine {{involved}} spoofing American southern style wrestling, and winning matches by DQ. Iwasa carried {{a folding chair}} painted in a stars and stripes pattern to <b>the</b> ring, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Floridas</b> would throw <b>the</b> chair to their opponents, then fake having been hit with it. The referee would then DQ their opponents, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Floridas</b> would leap {{to their feet and}} put their hands over their hearts as The USA Nation Anthem played. Later, they would add Takayuki Yagi to their shtick. Yagi portrayed a partial referee, dressing in an American Flag motif shirt and wearing oversized sunglasses that he required to see.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{before this}} 'Sheriff's Sale', Father Louis DuBourg was {{appointed}} the first Bishop of <b>the</b> Louisiana Territory <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Floridas</b> by Archbishop Carroll of Baltimore, August 18, 1814. Father DuBourg traveled to Rome in 1815 {{where he was}} consecrated Bishop of Louisiana <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Floridas.</b> <b>The</b> opening of schools in his frontier diocese was a primary concern, which necessitated the recruitment of teachers. Thus, we find Bishop DuBourg and his entourage, engaged in an eighteen-month extended tour of France and Belgium. Their quest was for members of religious orders willing to volunteer for service in Bishop DuBourg's mission parishes <b>and</b> schools of <b>the</b> Louisiana Territory.|$|R

5|$|On 7 August 1942, Allied forces (primarily U.S. Marine Corps units) {{landed on}} Guadalcanal, Tulagi, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> Islands in the Solomon Islands. The {{landings}} {{on the islands}} were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as bases to threaten supply routes between the U.S. and Australia, and secure the islands as launching points for a campaign with an eventual goal of isolating the major Japanese base at Rabaul while also supporting the Allied New Guinea campaign. The landings initiated the six-month-long Guadalcanal campaign.|$|E

5|$|The Scotch bonnet is preyed upon by vertebrates, such as fish, and invertebrates, {{including}} crabs such as {{the blue}} crab <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> stone crab. Crabs can crush the snail's shell, eating the soft internal organs and muscle tissue. The snail's only defense mechanism against predation is to draw its body into the shell. By doing so, they can close the aperture using the operculum.|$|E

Several dozen species of mammals also thrive in the region, from tiny bats and shrews to midsize raccoons (Procyon lotor), otters (Lontra canadensis), opossums (Didelphis virginiana), and foxes.

A total of 40people and 48mules and oxen drowned. An additional 32people drowned at Dickerson Bay and Goose Creek. Some coastal forts were damaged, while tents and equipment used by Confederate troops were lost. In Tallahassee, heavy rainfall and severe gales were reported, damaging homes and other properties.

5|$|Due {{to budget}} {{decreases}} and increased {{demands on the}} university, the UCF Board of Trustees, {{with the approval of}} the Board of Governors <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> Legislature, approved a 15% increase in tuition for the 2012–13 academic year. For the 2016-17 academic year, undergraduate tuition costs were $212.28 per credit hour for in-state students, and $748.89 per credit hour for out-of-state students. Graduate tuition costs were $369.65 per credit hour for in-state students, and $1,194.05 per credit hour for out-of-state students. Tuition for the medical school is $25,490 for both in-state and out-of-state students. Estimated annual cost for undergraduate students is $17,295 for Florida residents, and $33,392 for non-Florida residents. Expected costs for graduate students are $22,072 for in-state students, and $38,878 for out-of-state students. About 8% of tuition fees are allocated to support the university's athletic programs.|$|E
5|$|Europe {{is home to}} {{only three}} species: D. intermedia, D. anglica, and D. rotundifolia. Where the ranges of the two latter species overlap, they {{sometimes}} hybridize to form the sterile D. × obovata. In addition to the three species and the hybrid native to Europe, North America {{is also home to}} four additional species; D. brevifolia is a small annual native to coastal states from Texas to Virginia, while D. capillaris, a slightly larger plant with a similar range, is also found in areas of the Caribbean. The third species, D. linearis, is native to the northern United States and southern Canada. D. filiformis has two subspecies native to the East Coast of North America, the Gulf Coast, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> panhandle.|$|E

Marcus Vick threw two incomplete passes and was sacked before Virginia Tech was forced into a punt.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the Air Force was {{tasked with}} {{gathering}} intelligence, air reconnaissance, and air transport. Support of ground troops, both doctrinally {{and as a}} practical matter, became marginal. These missions were strongly influenced by a shrinking capability, since its combat aircraft could operate by daylight only, its anti-aircraft artillery was obsolete, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>FLORIDA</b> radar system had reached the limits of operational effectiveness. The retirement of the Hawker Hunters in 1994ended its ground support capability, and a cut of one-third from the defence budget meant that plans for a second purchase of F/A-18s and supporting air-to-ground weapons (the reason the multi-capable Hornet was selected) had to be canceled, leaving both it and the F-5s in a strictly air-to-air role.|$|E
5|$|On December 3, 2004, Gray's team {{issued its}} first extended-range {{forecast}} for the 2005 season, predicting a slightly above-average season.

Though the forecast predicted above-average activity, the level predicted was significantly less than the 2004 season. On April 1, 2005, after confirming that El Niño conditions would not develop, Gray and his team revised the December forecast upward, expecting 13 tropical storms instead of 11 and seven hurricanes instead of six.
