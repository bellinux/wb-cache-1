50|$|The potto has {{relatively}} few predators, because large mammalian carnivores cannot {{climb to the}} treetops where they live, and the birds of prey {{in this part of}} Africa are diurnal. One population of chimpanzees living in Mont Assirik, Senegal, was observed to eat pottos, taking them from their sleeping places during the day; however, this behaviour has not been observed in chimps elsewhere. Pottos living near villages face some predation from humans, who hunt them as bushmeat. They are sometimes preyed upon by <b>African</b> <b>palm</b> civets, although <b>African</b> <b>palm</b> civets are largely frugivorous.|$|R

40|$|Past climatic {{changes have}} caused extinction, speciation, and range dynamics, but {{assessing}} {{the influence of}} past multimillion-year climatic imprints on present-day biodiversity patterns remains challenging. We analyzed a new continental-scale data set to examine the importance of paleoclimatic effects on current gradients in <b>African</b> <b>palm</b> richness patterns. Using climate reconstructions from the late Miocene (10 mya), the Pliocene (3 mya), and the Last Glacial Maximum (0. 021 mya), we found that <b>African</b> <b>palm</b> diversity patterns exhibit pronounced historical legacies related to long-term climate change. Notably, pre-Pleistocene paleoprecipitation variables differentially affected current diversity patterns of palms grouped by contrasting habitat requirements. Accounting for present-day environment, rain forest palms exhibit greater species richness in localities where Pliocene precipitation was relatively high, whereas open-habitat palms show higher species richness in areas of relatively low precipitation during the Miocene Epoch. Our results demonstrate that diversity-climate relationships among <b>African</b> <b>palm</b> species include multimillion-year lagged dynamics, i. e., with historical legacies persisting across much longer time periods than commonly recognized...|$|R

50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>palm</b> civet is a crepuscular, solitary animal which emerges for a {{few hours}} around dawn and dusk to hunt for food.

Despite their otherwise solitary natures, <b>African</b> <b>palm</b> civets have been known to congregate in groups of as many as 15 animals if food is abundant. They have two sets of scent glands on the lower abdomen and between the third and fourth toes on each foot,which secrete a strong smelling substance which is used to mark territory and in mating.|$|R
