40|$|Brussels II bis Regulation is {{the first}} source of law of EU private {{international}} law that introduces <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>exequatur</b> for specific judgments given pursuant to Article 11 (8) which require {{the return of the}} child. The goal of the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>exequatur</b> is to achieve a rapid return of the child to his country of habitual residence immediately prior to her/his wrongful removal. This goal has to be reached, inter alia, by reducing the jurisdiction of the State of enforcement of certified judgments to questions of enforcement stricto sensu under the national procedural law of that State. On the other hand, the State of origin of the judgments shall be responsible for all matters relating to the merits of the judgments and to the certification of these judgments, this latter substituting the procedure of exequatur in the Member State of enforcement. The Povse case shows that complex facts of a case, proceedings before the respective national courts, the time needed for the interpretation of union law by the Court of EU, and the international law on the protection of human rights questions the goal of <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>exequatur</b> under this Regulation...|$|E
40|$|EU Member State {{judgments}} {{given in}} legal proceedings instituted on or after January 10, 2015, in civil or commercial matters, will be enforced in another Member State {{according to the}} Brussels Ibis Regulation, Regulation (EU) no 1215 / 2012. Brussels Ibis Regulation provides for a new framework where a declaration of enforceability is no longer required in the Member State addressed; with the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>exequatur</b> {{the focal point of}} the system shifts to enforcement proceedings. While Brussels Ibis Regulation specifies a few rules that directly impact national enforcement rules, many other require the assistance national lawmakers to be implemented. Whether this represents a true step forward towards the free movement of decisions, meaning less costly and time-consuming cross-border litigation, remains to be seen...|$|E
40|$|The Brussels {{regime is}} a {{legislative}} framework that regulates questions of transnational litigation in the European Union. Having been initially shaped upon negotiation of the 1968 Brussels Convention, {{it has been}} subsequently superseded and expanded in scope by the Brussels I Regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, alongside other instruments addressing specific areas of law. Recently, the Brussels regime has been amended by the Recast Brussels I Regulation, which entered into force on January 15, 2015, bringing about significant and long-awaited change. Addressing the experience of application of its predecessors, {{the changes in the}} Recast Regulation have been introduced to the treatment of choice-of-court agreements and their relationship with the lis pendens doctrine, <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>exequatur,</b> reaffirmation and clarification of the arbitration exclusion, as well as further minor amendments...|$|E
40|$|Mutual {{trust is}} one of the {{cornerstones}} of cooperation in the field of European Union private international law. Based on this principle the rules on the cross-border recognition and enforcement of judgments in the European Union are still subject to simplification. The step-by-step approach of the implementation of this principle led to the <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>exequatur,</b> often accompanied by a partial harmonization of enforcement law to improve and support the smooth working of cross-border enforcement without exequatur. In this regard, it seems that the Member States still want to have control over the ‘import’ of judgments which results in maintaining the ground for non-recognition and the possibility of relying on them in the Member State of enforcement. This article considers the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition in three areas of justice: civil and commercial matters, family law and maintenance. In these areas the European Union legislator has chosen three different approaches for the implementation of this principle...|$|R
40|$|Free {{circulation}} of judgments within the EU of the authentic instruments and agreements in matrimonial matters and {{in matters of}} parental responsibility is provided for in Regulation (EC) no. 2201 / 2003 of the Council of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility, repealing Regulation (EC) no. 1347 / 2000. For two categories of judgments, this Regulation provides for the suppression <b>of</b> <b>exequatur.</b> In this article we intend to continue analyzing the suppression <b>of</b> the <b>exequatur</b> under the situation of judgments in family law matters, relating to {{the return of the}} child in the cross-border cases, on judgments passed in another Member State...|$|R

40|$|If the European Commission {{decides to}} recast the Brussels IIbis Regulation, {{it is likely}} to submit a {{proposal}} in which the focus will be on practical matters, such as judicial cooperation, the return of abducted children, or the further <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>exequatur.</b> The questionnaire that was used for the public consultation on the ‘functioning’ of Brussels IIbis did not leave much room for criticism of the Regulation’s points of departure with regard to jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility. Yet, there are a few issues that may be more important than the prevention of parallel proceedings or the free circulation of judgments within the EU. One of them concerns the virtually unlimited scope of the regulation in cases in which jurisdiction is determined by prorogation (Article 12). Another problem results from the perpetuatio fori principle underlying Article 8. Both provisions confer jurisdiction even if the child is habitually resident outside the EU, which casts considerable doubt on the effectiveness of the court’s decision...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} of European Private International Law (EPIL) have considerably enhanced {{the principle of}} mutual recognition {{in the framework of}} judicial cooperation in civil matters. With regard to the free movement of judicial and extrajudicial judgments, the general guidelines provided by the Tampere and Stockholm programmes have been pursued under two different directions. On the one hand, mutual recognition has been achieved by a partial or complete harmonization of procedural law (Regulation No 1896 / 2006 creating a European order for payment procedure; Regulation No 861 / 2007 establishing a European Small Claims Procedure). On the other hand, mutual recognition has entailed a gradual abolition of all intermediate measures or proceedings for the recognition and enforcement of civil judgments issued by Member States (Regulation No 805 / 2004 on the European enforcement order for uncontested claims, and, partially, Regulation No 4 / 2009 on cross-border maintenance obligations). More recently, Regulation No 1215 / 2012 (Brussels I-bis) has provided for the direct enforcement of judgments given in another Member State without a declaration of enforceability (<b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>exequatur).</b> Nevertheless, under some of these instruments there remain limits to mutual recognition. For instance, under Brussels I-bis, the person against whom enforcement is sought may apply for refusal of the recognition or enforcement of a judgment if he considers that one of the grounds for refusal of recognition (e. g. public policy) is present. It is also possible to invoke the grounds for refusal available under the national law of the Member State of enforcement. The main purpose of the paper is to provide a coherent and comprehensive framework of the expansion of the principle of mutual recognition in EPIL instruments. It will then review the challenges posed by the (potential) extension of the principle on other sensitive areas of law, such as family matters and civil status documents...|$|E

After 1965, the small remaining American consular staff continued to operate under authority <b>of</b> <b>exequaturs</b> issued by Queen Elizabeth II. Following declaration of a republic, the United States closed its Consulate General on March 17, 1970.|$|R
40|$|Regulation 2201 / 2003 (Brussels II bis) {{contains}} unique, {{special rules}} on <b>exequatur</b> <b>of</b> {{two types of}} foreign judgments: {{on the right to}} visitation and on the return of the child abducted from the state of her/his habitual residence. The paper discusses these rules, with reference to the broader context that includes rules on international jurisdiction of courts of EU Member States in matters of parental responsibility, and rules <b>of</b> <b>exequatur</b> <b>of</b> foreign judgments on parental responsibility in general. The importance of the unique rules is reflected in the fact, that the enforcement of judgments of the courts of EU Member States in these matters is automatic, which means without the need of any special procedure, on the basis of certificates issued by the court of a Member State that has given the judgment, and without review by the Member State of enforcement, thus contributing to the effective exercise of parental responsibility in the child's best interests...|$|R
