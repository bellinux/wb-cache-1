50|$|Axles {{originally}} had a tag bolted to their differential cover stamped with their gear ratio, but this tag often rusted off over time or was intentionally removed. The Line Setting Ticket can be checked {{to identify the}} <b>axle</b> <b>model,</b> gear ratio, and whether it {{is equipped with a}} traction device, using an International parts code book.|$|E
5000|$|The fab lab trailer is a 2007 Pace American Shadow GT Daytona dual <b>axle</b> (<b>model</b> SCX8528TA3). It is 32' long, 8' wide, and 7' high. The {{tailgate}} {{opens to}} add a 6' deck {{at the back of}} the trailer. The main entrance is a door on the passenger side towards the front. A 6.5' tall custom steel box covers most of the tongue. The lab requires a space approximately 60' long by 16' wide for operation as a lab. The power requirements are 240V single phase with minimum 40A service. To run all the equipment in the lab at once (including AC and overhead lights) is about 20 kW; to run only the 120V equipment is about 8 kW.|$|E

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{creation}} of computational model of AZUB recumbent tricycle composite axle for stress strain analysis. The thesis {{consists of four}} main parts. The first part contains introduction to the offer of full suspended tricycles from the most known manufacturers. Furthermore it contains introduction to composite materials that makes the main element of AZUB´´s suspension, and {{the description of the}} AZUB´´s front axle. In the second part there is detailed compilation of computational model for purpose of stress strain analysis of three load states. The effect of specific material and geometry parameters on axle behavior is discussed with the aim of choosing the most appropriate variant. Third part deals with the manufacturing of the front axle prototype and with tests leading to input data for numerical model and verification of computational model. Modifications and changes that lead to manufacturing of the second prototype are content of the last part. Based on this experience some recommendations for future development of the numerical <b>axle</b> <b>model</b> and the front axle suspension itself are formulated...|$|E

50|$|With the {{introduction}} of the Mk3 Transit in 1986 came the next generation of the County 4x4. This would prove to be a very popular and successful version of the County Transit 4x4, and the last to use the Dana beam axle layout. Later County 4x4 models switched to using an independent front suspension setup which was inherently more complex in design than the earlier beam <b>axle</b> <b>models.</b> Later panel vans also lost the twin-wheel rear axle that had been fitted on earlier LWB versions.|$|R
50|$|This is a 1 ST dual-wheeled rear <b>axle</b> (dually) <b>model</b> with a 120 in load bed. These {{models have}} gross weights of 8000 lb or 9000 lb.|$|R
50|$|The car was {{powered by}} a V-twin, {{air-cooled}} engine {{with a choice of}} 980 cc JAP or 1090 cc Precision types. Both power units drove through a friction drive and belt to the rear <b>axle.</b> Later <b>models</b> used a chain drive.|$|R
25|$|The NTSB made {{recommendations}} to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which included a prohibition of mounting on the same <b>axle</b> different <b>models</b> of tires which had different load-bearing characteristics and also that greater load-bearing characteristics be required in tires manufactured in the future.|$|R
5000|$|Two years later, in 1897, Hosea W. Libbey of Boston invented an {{electric}} bicycle (...) that was propelled by a “double electric motor”. The motor was designed within {{the hub of}} the crankset <b>axle.</b> This <b>model</b> was later re-invented and imitated in the late 1990s by Giant Lafree e-bikes.|$|R
50|$|In 1942, Pond {{developed}} a Model FG (Farm and Garden) tractor. This model {{would use a}} Ford Model A Four-cylinder engine, a Ford Model A Transmission and a Ford <b>Model</b> T rear <b>axle.</b> Early <b>models</b> were distinguished by the Shiny Chrome Ford Radiator. Later models were higher with a painted radiator.|$|R
5000|$|These {{models of}} trucks were {{produced}} in 27,500 lb to 60,920 lb Gross Vehicle Weight Ratings (the loaded {{weight of the}} truck), with both single and tandem rear <b>axle</b> <b>models.</b> The Fleetstar line was larger than the Loadstar (International's medium duty lineup during this time) and smaller than the Paystar (severe service) and Transtar (primarily semi-tractors). Fleetstars used the [...] "C" [...] series cab popular on the Loadstar and pickups, and later on got the newer [...] "D" [...] series cab, with some overlap between the two models. There were Cummins, Detroit Diesel, and International Harvester built engines available in larger sizes {{than those of the}} Loadstar line. Frame rail and axle sizes were generally larger than their smaller cousin, and were of the completely straight design for strength. These frames were typical of International truck frames in general, having large flanges, and great strength.|$|R
5000|$|The vehicle {{initially}} had a three-speed {{manual transmission}} driving the rear roadwheels via a semi-floating live rear <b>axle.</b> [...] Later <b>models</b> had a four speed transmission option.|$|R
50|$|In 1956, the International Harvester company {{introduced}} the Payhauler line of heavy duty off-highway rear-dump trucks, initially {{available as a}} 25-ton (23t) capacity rear-wheel-drive model. Unlike other haul trucks it had dual tires on the front (steering) axle and carried the load with the same weight on both <b>axles.</b> Early <b>models</b> had a Detroit Diesel 16V71 engine, later Cummins engines were used.|$|R
50|$|To {{overcome}} patent {{difficulties with}} the design they had sold to Locomobile, the Stanley brothers developed a new model with twin-cylinder engines geared directly to the rear <b>axle.</b> Later <b>models</b> had aluminium coachwork that resembled the internal combustion cars of the time, but they retained steam-car features by having no transmission, clutch, or driveshaft. They also had a fully sprung tubular steel frame.|$|R
50|$|A {{complete}} type 2 Bison, reconstructed from extant {{parts and}} a period lorry chassis, {{can be seen}} at The Tank Museum, Bovington. This example is a Thornycroft Tartar 3 ton, 6×4 of 1931 or later. The chassis here was a military forward-control Tartar used as a 3-ton general service lorry; military Tartars had one wheel {{on each side of the}} rear <b>axles,</b> civilian <b>models</b> had twin wheels — two wheels on each side.|$|R
40|$|Bachelor {{thesis is}} focused on project of design of <b>axles</b> for <b>model</b> of {{locomotive}} BN 30 U. The aim of this project is to create the simplest proposal of construction of the axle. The proposal must ensure simple assembly of axle. The design of axles is based especially on chosen propulsion of model. Thesis incorporates overview of models from foreign countries, of possible propulsions. It also includes proposal of solving of design, strength calculation and drawings documentation...|$|R
5000|$|Around 1921, Hall-Scott {{dropped its}} aero engine and rail car product lines, and {{expanded}} into building engines for tractors, trucks, boats, and stationary applications. The firm produced {{several hundred thousand}} two-speed rear axles, the Ruckstell <b>Axle,</b> for Ford's <b>Model</b> T through the mid-1920s.|$|R
50|$|The 100 {{models were}} {{fitted with a}} {{slightly}} wider chassis, independent front suspension (IFS) and two new engines. The change to IFS was a first for a Land Cruiser, and was made (in combination with rack-and-pinion steering) to improve on-road handling. However it also limited the vehicle's off-road capability and durability, hence the decision to offer the solid <b>axle</b> 105 <b>models</b> alongside the IFS 100 models in some markets. The table below identifies the range of 100 and 105 models and their worldwide availability.|$|R
5000|$|In 1965 {{the range}} covered rigid trucks with gross weights from 5.2 to 12.75 British tons, and tippers from 10.8 to 12.75 tons. [...] Higher gross weights became {{available}} with the subsequent introduction of versions featuring twin rear <b>axles</b> and articulated <b>models</b> were also quickly {{added to the}} range.|$|R
40|$|The {{chloride}} anion templated {{synthesis of}} an electrochemical anion sensory interlocked host system, {{prepared by the}} integration of redox-active 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -pentaphenylferrocene stopper groups into {{the structure of a}} rotaxane capable of binding anionic guests is described. Extensive (1) H NMR and electrochemical titration investigations were used to probe the anion recognition and sensing properties of the rotaxane, compared to the <b>axle</b> and <b>model</b> system components. A characteristic electrochemical response was observed for chloride binding by the rotaxane, which was attributed to the topologically constrained cavity of the interlocked host molecule...|$|R
50|$|Ford {{first used}} the 8.8 <b>axle</b> in 1983 <b>model</b> year trucks {{and is still}} in {{production}} for the Ford Ranger and Ford F-Series. It was also used in the Ford SUVs until Independent suspension replaced the solid axle. Ring, pinion and carrier all remained between the solid axle and independent rear suspension.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} a modular truck {{semi-trailer}} model is devel-oped in the multi-body toolbox SimMechanics, {{which is part}} of MAT-LAB/Simulink. It can be used to analyze a wide range of active control solutions (anywhere in the model), as well as the influence of passive vehicle modifications. As the model is modular, it is relatively easy (compared to conventional multi-body software packages) to modify or replace any of the components as well as the number and type of trailer <b>axles.</b> The <b>model</b> is validated using a wide range of measurement data obtained from measurements on a real air sprung tractor semi-trailer...|$|R
5000|$|The T4 {{was also}} {{available}} {{with a permanent}} 4WD system that uses a Viscous coupling unit as a centre differential to regulate the distribution of torque to the rear <b>axle.</b> These <b>models</b> are called [...] "syncro" [...] and were available with the 2.4D, 2.5Tdi and 2.5 petrol engines on all body types and both wheelbases. Some syncro models also have a mechanically locking rear differential. Since the rear differential precludes {{the placement of the}} spare wheel in the usual place under the body, syncro vans either store it inside the body or on an external, hinged bracket.|$|R
50|$|The {{platform}} utilises a {{front engine}} transaxle design with engines and gearboxes mounted transversly on a subframe. Only straight 5 engines were offered.A front subframe and front MacPherson struts were used and either Volvo's patented Deltalink rear <b>axle</b> on FWD <b>models</b> or Volvo's Multi-Link rear suspension with an independent rear subframe on AWD models.|$|R
