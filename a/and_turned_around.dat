5|$|Egyptian shadow clocks divided daytime into 12 {{parts with}} each part further divided into more precise parts. One type of shadow clock {{consisted}} of a long stem with five variable marks and an elevated crossbar which cast a shadow over those marks. It was positioned eastward in the morning, and was turned west at noon. Obelisks functioned {{in much the same}} manner: the shadow cast on the markers around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate the time. The obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or afternoon, as well as the summer and winter solstices. A third shadow clock, developed c. 1500, was similar in shape to a bent T-square. It measured the passage of time by the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The T was oriented eastward in the mornings, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> at noon, so that it could cast its shadow in the opposite direction.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} subway tunnel from City Hall to {{the portal}} at 23rd Street, {{as well as}} the bridge to carry the line across the Schuylkill River, just north of Market Street, were built from April 1903 to August 1905. Construction on the Market Street Elevated west from this point began In April 1904, and the line opened on March 4, 1907, from 69th Street Terminal to a loop around City Hall at 15th Street. The line was elevated west of the river and underground east of the river. The tunnel was also used by streetcar lines, now SEPTA's Subway-Surface lines, that entered the line just east of the river <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> at the City Hall loop. Philadelphia was unusual in that construction of its initial downtown subway was undertaken using PRT (Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co.) private capital only, with no contribution from public funds.|$|E
500|$|Skipper W was a 1945 sorrel {{stallion}} bred by H. J. Wiescamp of Alamosa, Colorado. Sired by Nick Shoemaker, {{whose father}} was Nick sired by Shiek P-11, Skipper W was out of Hired Girl, a daughter of Cowboy P-12. His second dam, or maternal grandmother, was Leche, who was also fathered by Nick by Shiek P-11. The colt was named Skipper W because, as Wiescamp related:I had another good stud colt born {{around the same time}} as Skipper. He was a palomino sired by Gold Mount and out of Slipalong Wiescamp. That was also the year that the good movie, Showboat, came out and I named the little yellow colt after that picture. Anyway, I had Hired Girl up in a corral and, after she foaled, I told a fellow who was working for me to disinfect the naval on the colt [...] After the man did that, the colt got up <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> and kicked him 'cause it smarted. I said to that fellow, [...] "Look at that, he already knows he's the boss! I've got a showboat, and every boat needs a skipper, so that's what I'm going to name him– Skipper." [...] I added the W for Wiescamp.|$|E

500|$|During {{the early}} eighteenth century France again {{provided}} {{the impetus for}} Spain's interest in Texas. In 1699, French forts were established at Biloxi Bay and on the Mississippi River, ending Spain's exclusive control of the Gulf Coast. Although Spain [...] "refused to concede France's right to be in Louisiana" [...] and warned King Louis XIV of France {{that he could be}} excommunicated for ignoring the 200-year-old papal edict giving the Americas to Spain, they took no further actions to stop France's encroachment or expand the Spanish presence. The two countries became allies during the War of the Spanish Succession and cooperated in the Americas. Despite their friendship, Spain remained unwilling to allow the French to trade within their territory. On hearing rumors of French incursions into Texas in 1707, the viceroy of New Spain ordered all provincial governors to prevent the entry of foreigners and their goods. To dissuade the Tejas Indians from accepting goods from the French, a contingent of soldiers under Pedro de Aguirre traveled into Texas. His expedition reached only as far as the Colorado River <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> after learning that the Tejas chief was still unhappy with the Spanish. The group did visit the area around the San Antonio River, and was much impressed with the land and availability of water. They believed the river to be unnamed and called it San Antonio de Padua, not realizing that Terán and Massanet had camped nearby years before on the feast day of Saint Anthony of Padua and had given the river the same name.|$|E
500|$|Sydneys second patrol {{began on}} 18 October, with her {{aircraft}} involved in strikes against North Korean units, coastal shipping, railway bridges, and other supply routes. They also performed their first {{close air support}} mission on 21 October, providing cover for the 1st Commonwealth Division. Two Sea Furies were shot down on 25 October; both pilots escaped unharmed. The next day, during a moderately successful strike involving five RAN aircraft against a railway tunnel, a Firefly was shot down [...] inland, deep inside North Korean territory. There were doubts that a rescue helicopter could reach the crash site and return safely, as {{it was at the}} extreme limit of helicopter range and some of the return flight would occur after dark. Despite this, Uncle Peter's USN aircrew volunteered to try, and after the observer was quickly taught how to use an Owen submachine gun, the helicopter launched at 1622 hours. The four RAN aircraft provided cover for the two downed personnel until they were ordered to return to the carrier; two of the Fireflies met Uncle Peter at 1715 hours, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> to escort the helicopter. At 1733 hours, Uncle Peter arrived at the crash site and collected the RAN aircrew, with covering fire provided by the escorting Fireflies and the helicopter's observer. All three aircraft were at extreme fuel limits on their return: the two Fireflies barely made it back to Sydney, while Uncle Peter arrived at Kimpo airfield at 1830 hours and had to land with the aid of truck headlights. The rescue was the longest helicopter rescue transit over North Korean territory during the war, and Sikorsky pilot received both the British Distinguished Service Medal and the United States Navy Cross: the only instance of these two medals being awarded to the same person for the same action. Sydney was relieved by USS Rendova on 27 October and returned to Kure.|$|E

2500|$|According to Tabari, Muhammad's {{first stop}} in his conquest for Khaybar {{was in the}} valley of al-Raji, which was {{directly}} between the Ghatafan people and the Khaybar.

[...] After a day of travel, the Ghatafan thought they heard their enemy behind them <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> in order to protect their families and possessions, thus opening the path for Muhammad's army.

2500|$|One of the {{greatest}} threats {{to the survival of}} hatchlings is artificial lighting. [...] When a sea turtle hatches, its evolutionary instincts push it to move towards the brightest light in view, which naturally would be the sun or the moon, leading them toward the ocean horizon and into their new ecosystem. However, due to the continual expansion of cities, construction of condos and hotels on coasts everywhere has grown exponentially. [...] With the invention of the light bulb and therefore artificial light, the sea turtle’s natural source of guiding light has been replaced and is no longer the only or the brightest [...] thing of light. [...] With virtually every coast in Mexico now constantly lit with buildings, the hatchlings become easily confused <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around,</b> few of them making successful treks to the ocean. Studies support artificial light as the leading cause for hatchling disorientation, showing that in 1999, 51% of the nests studied showed signs of confusion with one-fourth of all the hatchlings headed in the wrong direction.|$|E

2500|$|The Smart Fortwo uses a {{very small}} front crumple zone. The second {{generation}} Smart Fortwo has been awarded 4 out of 5 stars in the Euro NCAP Adult Occupant Protection and 2 out of 4 stars in the Pedestrian protection test, but was not tested for Child Occupant Protection as it has no rear seats. The original Smart was awarded 3 out of 5 stars for Adult Occupant Protection. In American tests using a five-star rating, Smart cars received a four-star safety rating for the driver from a front impact, and a five-star safety rating for the driver for a side impact. [...] It also received [...] "Good" [...] ratings for front and side crash protection in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) tests. [...] However, in an April 2009 40mph frontal offset crash test between a Fortwo and a Mercedes C-Class, [...] "the Smart went air-borne <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> 450 degrees" [...] causing [...] "extensive intrusion into the space around the dummy from head to feet".

The men rejoiced with harsh shouts and they fired their weapons like it was the Fourth of July.

Nolan was not finished. He was missing men. After a rest, he sent out men with water to look for stragglers. They found some wandering horses that had been with the bison hunters. They made a diligent hunt for survivors and recovered what supplies they could. [...] Nolan was still missing men and he feared many were dead. [...] The men began to recover from their ordeal.|$|E
