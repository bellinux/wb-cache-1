[...] It is essentially the reverse of Adaptive optics, rather than minimizing the effect of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>disturbance,</b> Schlieren detection capitalizes on that effect. This form of MASINT is both optical and geophysical because of the optical detection of a geophysical (atmospheric) effect. Schlieren photography may be used to provide an early warning of an imminent threat or impending attack, and if sufficiently advanced, may be used in the elimination of stealth targets.|$|E

For it was not the wing itself but the force of the eddying currents of air that had sent him whirling away from the monster. With the indicator at zero the magnetic currents and the opposing powers of attraction and repulsion were so evenly balanced that any violent <b>atmospheric</b> <b>disturbance</b> affected him {{in the same way that}} thistledown is affected by a summer breeze. He had noticed something of this before, but whenever a strong wind was blowing he was accustomed to rise to a position above the air currents. This was the first time he had slept with the indicator at zero.|$|E

The results indicate that <b>atmospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> may be more important than internal disturbances in setting inlet controls requirements because they are usually not anticipated and because normal shock response to rapid <b>atmospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> is not attenuated by the inlet, as it is for engine induced disturbances. However, before inlet control requirements can be fully assessed, more statistics on extreme <b>atmospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> are needed...|$|R

Tigh hands her a drink, which is tainted with poison. After Ellen succumbs to it, Tigh grieves. Meanwhile, Galactica arrives in far orbit above New Caprica and sends raptors to launch drones which would fool the Cylons into thinking two Battlestars are coming. On the surface, the resistance start their uprising by detonating several explosions to destroy key critical infrastructures across the settlement. As Centurions are guarding the parked ships, Galactica jumps into the upper atmosphere launching vipers during free fall to destroy the Centurion posts, before jumping back into space, causing significant <b>atmospheric</b> <b>disturbance</b> and creating a distraction for the human survivors in the process. However, the fall causes considerable damage to the Battlestar. Adama discovers that four Basestars are surrounding them, two more than previously anticipated.|$|E
50|$|The Aleutian Low is {{characterized}} by heavily influencing the path and strength of cyclones. Tropical cyclones which form in the sub-polar latitudes in the North Pacific typically slow down and reach maximum intensity {{in the area of}} the Aleutian Low. Cyclones that form in the tropical and equatorial regions of the Pacific can veer northward and get caught in the Aleutian Low. This is usually seen in the later summer seasons. Both the November 2011 Bering Sea cyclone and the November 2014 Bering Sea cyclone were post-tropical cyclones that had dissipated and restrengthened when the systems entered the Aleutian Low region. The storms are remembered and marked as two of the strongest storms to impact the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands with pressure dropping below 950mb in each system. The magnitude of the low pressure creates an extreme <b>atmospheric</b> <b>disturbance,</b> which can cause other significant shifts in weather. Following the November 2014 Bering Sea cyclone, a huge cold wave, November 2014 North American cold wave, hit the US bringing record breaking low temperatures to many states.|$|E
50|$|Kane's {{mental health}} and memory begin to falter. Her {{recollections}} of her lost spouse have never been fully reconciled within her own memory of her lost loved one. She begins {{to show signs of}} odd behavior in laying out her husband's old clothing as if her husband might suddenly reappear and need them to put on. When a storm is brewing, her mental health seems to confuse the storm for an air raid warning of another atomic bomb attack and she seeks to protect her visiting grandchildren by employing folk remedies, which confuse her children and especially her grandchildren. As the storm later intensifies again, Kane becomes more disoriented and mistakenly confuses the storm for the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>disturbance</b> caused by the bombing of Nagasaki which she witnessed visually from a safe distance when her husband was killed many years ago. In her disoriented state, Kane decides that she must save her husband, still alive in her memory, from the impending atomic blast. With all her remaining strength, she takes her small umbrella to battle the storm on foot on the way to warn her husband in Nagasaki of the mortal threat still fresh in her mind of the atomic blast which she cannot forget.|$|E
