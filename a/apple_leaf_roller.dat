Caterpillars of the Brazilian skipper butterfly (Calpodes ethlius), {{also known as the}} larger canna <b>leaf</b> <b>roller,</b> cut the leaves and roll them over to live inside while pupating and eating the leaf. [...] In addition, caterpillars of the lesser canna <b>leaf</b> <b>roller</b> (Geshna cannalis), a grass moth, will sew the leaves shut before they can unfurl by spinning a silk thread around the leaf. The resultant leaf damage can be distressing to a gardener.|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of mutualism is receiving more attention in community ecology. In this study, the fire ant Solenopsis invicta {{was found to}} take advantage of the shelters constructed by the <b>leaf</b> <b>roller</b> Sylepta derogata to protect mealybugs (Phenacoccus solenopsis) against their natural enemies. This protective effect of fire ant tending on the survival of mealybugs in shelters was observed when enemies and <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> were simultaneously present. Specifically, fire ants moved the mealybugs inside the shelters produced by S. derogata on enemy-infested plants. Compared with that in plants without ants, the survival of mealybugs in shelters in the presence of natural enemies in plants with ants markedly improved. Both the protection of ants and the shelters provided by <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> did not affect the survival of mealybugs in the absence of enemies in plants. Ants and <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> significantly improved the survival of mealybugs in predator-infested plants, whereas no such improvement was observed in parasitoid-infested ones...|$|R

40|$|Considering the {{difficulty}} of parameter determination in the original support vector machine (SVM), the genetic algorithm (GA) is used to select {{the parameters of the}} SVM automatically and the orthogonal method is utilized to determine the best GA parameters. In view of the characteristics of <b>apple</b> <b>leaf</b> disease images, the SVM based on optimized GA is applied to <b>apple</b> <b>leaf</b> disease recognition. Firstly, the color and texture characteristics of <b>apple</b> disease <b>leaf</b> images are extracted as feature vectors. Then, Kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) -based feature selection is performed to identify the best features. Finally, the proposed optimized GA-SVM is used to classify <b>apple</b> <b>leaf</b> disease images. The orthogonal experimental results demonstrate that the proposed KPCA/GA-SVM model recognition ratios are 98. 14 %, 94. 05 %, and 97. 96 % for apple mosaic virus, apple rust and <b>apple</b> alternaria <b>leaf</b> spot, respectively.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{classification}} accuracy rate of <b>apple</b> <b>leaf</b> disease images and {{solve the problem}} of dimension redundancy in feature extraction, Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) transform and sparse representation are applied to <b>apple</b> <b>leaf</b> disease recognition. Firstly 9 color features and 8 texture features of disease leaf images are extracted and taken as feature vectors after dimensionality reduction by the K-L transform. Then, for each of apple mosaic virus, apple rust and <b>apple</b> alternaria <b>leaf</b> spot, 40 <b>apple</b> <b>leaf</b> images are selected as the training samples, whose feature vectors are made up of the dictionary of the sparse representation, respectively. Each testing sample is classified into the class with the minimal residual. The identifying results using the proposed method are analyzed and compared with those of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and original sparse representation method. The average classification accuracy rate of the proposed method is 94. 18 %, which confirms its good robustness. In addition, the proposed method not only improves the plant leaf disease classification accuracy but also solves the redundancy problem of the extracted features. </p...|$|R
40|$|Field {{experiments}} were {{conducted during the}} 2012 and 2013 cropping seasons at the University of Maiduguri to compared the efficacies of selected aqueous plant extracts on {{the management of the}} population of eggplant <b>leaf</b> <b>roller</b> (Eublemma olivacea Wlk.) infesting eggplant (Solanum melongena L.). The extracts were from neem leaf; bitter melon; black current; ginger rhizome and wild onion. They were compared with a conventional insecticide, Lambdacot 500 EC and the absolute control. Extracts were applied at 5 % w/v while Lambdacot was applied at 1. 5 g a. i/ha. The results indicated that the mean number of <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> in treated plots were significantly (P< 0. 05) lower than the control. The highest mean number of <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> was 3. 01 and 3. 93. Lambdacot 500 EC had the lowest eggplant <b>leaf</b> <b>roller</b> counts per plant followed by neem, ginger rhizome and wild onion. The mean number of leaves damaged per plant followed similar trend. There was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher number of eggplant fruits/plant, fruit weight and fruit yield in the decreasing order of Lambdacot 500 EC, neem, wild onion, bitter melon and black current. The absolute control had the fewest number of eggplant fruits/plant, fruit weight and fruit yield. These aqueous extracts should be adopted by eggplant farmers as they are cost effective and friendly to the environment. However, the actual quantities of these extracts to be applied per plant depending on the variety of eggplant, season and weather condition of the cropping season and canopy architecture remain to be critically explored...|$|R
