25|$|Tilburg {{has three}} railway stations: Tilburg (Centraal), Tilburg Universiteit and Tilburg Reeshof. The latter {{was built to}} connect the then-latest {{district}} of Tilburg, the Reeshof. Intercity trains only stop at Tilburg (centraal). The name of Tilburg Universiteit Station was Tilburg West from its construction in 1968 to December 2010, however, after 40 years, {{it was not the}} westernmost station anymore. A fourth railway station is planned for Berkel-Enschot, also in the municipality of Tilburg and getting more absorbed into Tilburg. In the past, until 1938, Berkel-Enschot had its own train station. Udenhout, lying further northeast in the municipality, also had its train station until 1938. Both stations <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to 's-Hertogenbosch.|$|E
25|$|In geometry, a {{body with}} a single stable resting {{position}} is called monostatic, and the term mono-monostatic has been coined to describe a body which additionally has only one unstable point of balance. (The previously known monostatic polyhedron does not qualify, as it has three unstable equilibria.) A sphere weighted so that its center of mass is shifted from the geometrical center is a mono-monostatic body. A more common example is the Comeback Kid, Weeble or roly-poly toy (see left figure). Not only {{does it have a}} low center of mass, but it also has a specific shape. At equilibrium, the center of mass and the contact point <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> perpendicular to the ground. When the toy is pushed, its center of mass rises and also shifts away from that line. This produces a righting moment which returns the toy to the equilibrium position.|$|E
500|$|Outgoing Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta {{defended the}} award's precedence, saying [...] "Our {{military}} reserves its highest decorations obviously {{for those who}} display gallantry and valor in actions when their lives <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> {{and we will continue}} to do so. But we should also have the ability to honor the extraordinary actions that make a true difference in combat operations. The contribution they make does contribute to the success of combat operations, particularly when they remove the enemy from the field of battle, even if those actions are physically removed from the fight." [...] Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Nate Christensen, added, [...] "Extraordinary achievement directly impacting combat operations at this level deserves to be recognized with a distinctive medal, not a device on an existing medal. The DWM is visionary in that it fills a need for a non-valorous combat impact medal." ...|$|E

2500|$|Organisers must be determined, charismatic, {{and persuasive}} {{individuals}} able to sway groups to action under trying circumstances when jobs <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> Organisers must {{be strong enough}} to stand up to constant confrontation and must be willing to take big risks.

2500|$|Wels. Originally a Roman ‘Municipium’ ‘Ovilava’ {{founded by}} Hadrian and given ‘Colonia’ status by Caracalla. In the 6th century the Bavarians had {{established}} {{themselves in the}} area and in 726 a ‘castrum uueles’ is mentioned. The fortified settlement was in the southern portion of the Roman defences, but a suburb developed to the North with the ‘oberes markt’ a long rectangular market place, and this was still within the area of the Roman enclosure. Matthäus Merian produced a detailed print of Wels in 1649, and a slightly altered copy of this was included in Vischer’s Upper Austria in 1674. Two towers still exist, the Wasserturm, which faces the river Traun, and the Ledererturm to the west, which was first mentioned in 1326. Both these towers <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of the Roman wall.|$|E

2500|$|In {{celestial}} mechanics, the Lagrangian points ( [...] ; also Lagrange points, L-points, or libration points) are {{positions in}} an orbital configuration of two large bodies {{where a small}} object affected only by gravity can maintain a stable position relative to the two large bodies. The Lagrange points mark positions where the combined gravitational pull of the two large masses provides precisely the centripetal force required to orbit with them. There are five such points, labeled L1 to L5, all in the orbital plane of the two large bodies. The first three <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> connecting the two large bodies; the last two, L4 and L5, each form an equilateral triangle with the two large bodies. The two latter points are stable, which implies that objects can orbit around them in a rotating coordinate system tied to the two large bodies.|$|E
2500|$|In {{her last}} known {{transmission}} at 8:43am Earhart broadcast [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> 157 337. We will repeat this message. We will repeat this on 6210 kilocycles. Wait." [...] However, {{a few moments}} later she was back on the same frequency (3105kHz) with a transmission that was logged as a [...] "questionable": [...] "We are running on line north and south." [...] Earhart's transmissions seemed to indicate she and Noonan believed they had reached Howland's charted position, which was incorrect by about five nautical miles (10km). The Itasca used her oil-fired boilers to generate smoke {{for a period of time}} but the fliers apparently did not see it. The many scattered clouds in the area around Howland Island have also been cited as a problem: their dark shadows on the ocean surface may have been almost indistinguishable from the island's subdued and very flat profile.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{researchers}} believe that the Electra ran out of fuel while searching for Howland Island and that Earhart and Noonan ditched at sea. The plane would have carried enough fuel to reach Howland with some extra to spare. The extra fuel would cover some contingencies such as headwinds and searching for Howland. The plane could fly a compass course toward Howland through the night. In the morning, the time of apparent sunrise would allow the plane to determine its line of position (a sun line that ran 157–337). From that line, the plane could determine how much further it must travel before reaching a parallel sun line that ran through Howland. At 6:14 AM Itasca time, Earhart estimated they were 200 miles away from Howland. As the plane closed with Howland, it {{expected to be in}} radio contact with Itasca. With the radio contact, the plane should be able to use radio direction finding (RDF) to head directly for the Itasca and Howland. Unfortunately, the plane was not receiving a radio signal from Itasca, so it would be unable to determine an RDF bearing to the ship. Although Itasca was receiving HF radio signals from the plane, it did not have HF RDF equipment, so it could not determine a bearing to the plane. The communications going to the plane were almost non-existent. Consequently, the plane was not directed to Howland; it was left on its own with little fuel. Presumably, the plane reached the parallel sun line and started searching for Howland on that line of position. At 7:42 AM, Earhart reported, [...] "We must be on you, but cannot see you – but gas is running low. Have been unable to reach you by radio. We are flying at 1,000 feet." [...] At 8:43 AM, Earhart reported, [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> 157 337. We will repeat this message. We will repeat this on 6210 kilocycles. Wait." ...|$|E

He knows well enough that were a dozen white men to come out to avenge such a deed, with a few waggon-loads of goods to offer to his neighbours as pay for their assistance, he and his tribe would be exterminated. When we are once on our way again we must beware. The feeling among the tribe at the loss they have sustained must be very bitter, although they may repress all outward exhibition of it to us, and if they attack us just as we <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> between their land and their neighbour's they can deny all knowledge of it.

That is about forty miles from here, and I have heard that the Yankees <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> from there right and left. I believe our troops are at Florence; but I am not sure about that, because both parties are {{constantly}} shifting their position, and I hear very little, as you may suppose, of what is being done. Anyhow, I think we cannot do better than go on until we strike the railway, keep along by that till we get within a short distance of Mount Pleasant, and then cross it. After that we can decide whether we will travel by the road or keep on through the woods. But we cannot find our way through the woods at night; we should lose ourselves before we had gone twenty yards." ...|$|E
