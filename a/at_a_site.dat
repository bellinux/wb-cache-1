5|$|Chromium, use of: The use of {{chromium}} {{was invented}} in China no later than 210 BC when the Terracotta Army was interred <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>site</b> not far from modern Xi'an; modern archaeologists discovered that bronze-tipped crossbow bolts at the site {{showed no sign of}} corrosion after more than 2,000 years, because they had been coated in chromium. Chromium was not used anywhere else until the experiments of French pharmacist and chemist Louis Nicolas Vauquelin (1763–1829) in the late 1790s.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} many Oxford colleges, Jesus {{provides}} sporting facilities for students, including playing fields <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>site</b> in east Oxford off the Cowley Road known as Bartlemas (for {{its proximity to}} St Bartholomew's Chapel). Football, rugby, netball, field hockey, cricket, and tennis can be played there. Squash courts are at a separate city-centre site on St Cross Road. The college also provides students with membership of the university's gym and swimming pool on Iffley Road.|$|E

5|$|A lead coffin in a rock-cut grave was {{discovered}} <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>site</b> {{adjacent to the}} Fosse Way in 1988. This discovery, and the impending commercial development of the site by the landowner, Showerings, led archaeologists to undertake more extensive excavations in the 1990s. The grave {{was part of a}} larger cemetery which contained 17 burials lying on a rough east-west alignment, indicating probable Christian adherence. Two other, smaller, cemeteries contained graves aligned north-south, possibly signifying pagan religious practices. One burial was in a substantial stone coffin which had been positioned beneath a mausoleum, the foundations of which remained.|$|E
5|$|But the Parthian Empire, {{weakened}} by internal strife and wars with Rome, {{was soon to}} be followed by the Sassanid Empire. Indeed, shortly afterward, Ardashir I, the local Iranian ruler of Persis (modern Fars Province, Iran) from Estakhr began subjugating the surrounding territories in defiance of Arsacid rule. He confronted Artabanus V at the Battle of Hormozdgān on 28 April 224AD, perhaps <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>site</b> near Isfahan, defeating him and establishing the Sassanid Empire. There is evidence, however, that suggests Vologases VI continued to mint coins at Seleucia as late as 228AD.|$|E
5|$|Casey {{and some}} members of his staff came ashore on A-Day; the advance echelon of his ASCOM {{headquarters}} arrived two days later. Work began immediately on the airfield at Tacloban, and commenced on airfields in central Leyte soon after they were captured. Heavy seasonal rains thwarted attempts to develop the airbases in central Leyte and {{it was decided to}} abandon their development and construct a new airbase on the coast <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>site</b> occupied by Sixth Army headquarters. The need to get aircraft based on Leyte to stop the Japanese from reinforcing the island was so pressing that Lieutenant General Walter Krueger agreed to move his headquarters.|$|E

5|$|Ethnographies also caution against over-interpretation of sites. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>site</b> in Chaco Canyon can {{be found}} a {{pictograph}} with a star, crescent and hand. It has been argued by some astronomers {{that this is a}} record of the 1054 Supernova. However recent reexaminations of related 'supernova petroglyphs' raises questions about such sites in general and anthropological evidence suggests other inrepretations. The Zuni people, who claim a strong ancestral affiliation with Chaco, marked their sun-watching station with a crescent, star, hand and sundisc, similar to those found at the Chaco site.|$|E
5|$|First {{offered in}} 1946 in the Sandusky area and later {{expanded}} to serve Erie, Huron, Lorain, and Ottawa counties, extension programs established {{a foundation for}} BGSU Firelands, the university's regional campus. The college was established <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>site</b> located near Lake Erie in Huron, Ohio when the first building (now Foundation Hall) was opened. In 2003, Cedar Point Center opened its doors on the Firelands campus. The facility houses a 450-seat divisible public meeting area, smaller conference rooms, a cyber cafe, multimedia classrooms, and two distance learning classrooms. In March 2011, BGSU Firelands unveiled a new master plan calling {{for the construction of}} three buildings to handle more students, more college/community partnerships; and expand the James H. McBride Arboretum to the entire campus.|$|E
5|$|Fort Snelling was {{established}} in 1819 to extend United States jurisdiction over the area and to allay concerns about British fur traders in the area. The soldiers initially camped <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>site</b> {{on the south side}} of the Minnesota River, but conditions were hard there and nearly a fifth of the soldiers died of scurvy in the winter of 1819–1820. They later moved their camp to Camp Coldwater in May 1820. Much of the military's activity was conducted there while the fort was built. Camp Coldwater, the site of a cold, clear, flowing spring, was also considered sacred by the native Dakota.|$|E

5|$|In 1164, Nur al-Din {{dispatched}} Shirkuh to lead an {{expeditionary force}} {{to prevent the}} Crusaders from establishing a strong presence in an increasingly anarchic Egypt. Shirkuh enlisted Ayyub's son, Saladin, as an officer under his command. They successfully drove out Dirgham, the vizier of Egypt, and reinstated his predecessor Shawar. After being reinstated, Shawar ordered Shirkuh to withdraw his forces from Egypt, but Shirkuh refused, claiming it was Nur al-Din's will that he remain. Over {{the course of several}} years, Shirkuh and Saladin defeated the combined forces of the Crusaders and Shawar's troops, first at Bilbais, then <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>site</b> near Giza, and in Alexandria, where Saladin would stay to protect while Shirkuh pursued Crusader forces in Lower Egypt.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Alaska celebrated 100 {{years since}} its {{purchase}} by the United States from Russia. To celebrate the event, Fairbanksans built A-67 (later Alaskaland and today Pioneer Park), {{a theme park}} celebrating the history of Fairbanks and Alaska. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>site</b> away from downtown Fairbanks, it features pioneer cabins, historic exhibits, and the steamer SS Nenana, one of the steamboats that traveled Interior Alaska rivers during the gold rush era. The summer exposition that opened the park in July 1967 was attended by U.S. Vice President Hubert Humphrey but was plagued by rain, financial problems, and low attendance.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to {{mitigate}} damage by camas pocket gophers to sensitive habitat, the Oregon Department of Transportation and the Institute for Applied Ecology trap and relocate the animals. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>site</b> south of Philomath, Oregon, the IAE is working to protect a small but viable population of Kincaid's lupine (Lupinus sulphureus). This threatened flower is the primary host plant for the endangered Fender's blue butterfly (Icaricia icarioides fenderi), which is endemic to the Willamette Valley. The gophers are relocated to a nearby location distant from the lupines.|$|E

5|$|Little {{was known}} about their {{behaviour}} until the field studies of Birutė Galdikas, who became a leading authority on the apes. When she arrived in Borneo, Galdikas settled into a primitive bark and thatch hut, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>site</b> she dubbed Camp Leakey, {{near the edge of}} the Java Sea. Despite numerous hardships, she remained there for over 30 years and became an outspoken advocate for orangutans and the preservation of their rainforest habitat, which is rapidly being devastated by loggers, palm oil plantations, gold miners, and unnatural forest fires.|$|E
5|$|One {{field study}} found that red wattlebirds foraged for longer periods when nectar {{concentrations}} in flowers were low, and consumed fewer insects at this time. However, {{this could have been}} because the temperature was lower and hence insects were less active. In Gingin, Western Australia, 97% of red wattlebirds <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>site</b> of two mixed kangaroo paw species were observed feeding on a single species at its peak flowering: cats paw in August and red-and-green kangaroo paw (A. manglesii) in September, with very few visits to the other species or hybrids.|$|E
5|$|The Cartman {{drug market}} subplot was heavily {{influenced}} by the 1983 crime film Scarface, with Cartman resembling fictional drug lord Tony Montana and KFC founder Colonel Sanders as antagonist Alejandro Sosa. The episode also included several jokes about Pope Benedict XVI and the child sexual abuse scandals that had been surrounding the Catholic Church at the time. The concept of a former KFC restaurant becoming a marijuana dispensary came from a news story about a real marijuana dispensary in Palms, Los Angeles, built <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>site</b> formerly housing a Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise.|$|E

40|$|Certain {{carnivore}} {{research projects}} and approaches depend on successful capture of individuals of interest. The {{number of people}} present <b>at</b> <b>a</b> capture <b>site</b> may determine success of a capture. In this study 36 lion capture cases in the Kruger National Park were used to evaluate {{whether the number of}} people present <b>at</b> <b>a</b> capture <b>site</b> influenced lion response rates and whether the number of people <b>at</b> <b>a</b> sampling <b>site</b> influenced the time it took to process the collected samples. The analyses suggest that when nine or fewer people were present, lions appeared faster <b>at</b> <b>a</b> call-up locality compared with when there were more than nine people. The number of people, however, did not influence the time it took to process the lions. It is proposed that efficient lion capturing should spatially separate capture and processing sites and minimise the number of people <b>at</b> <b>a</b> capture <b>site.</b> </p...|$|R
