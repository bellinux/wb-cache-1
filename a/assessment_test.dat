Since hands-on ability is considered an asset in the dental profession, this research investigates the applicantsâ€ ™ clinical potential by way of three very specific hands-on <b>assessment</b> <b>tests.</b> Each applicant was given a hands-on test consisting of the Oâ€™Conner Tweezer Dexterity, Grooved Pegboard, and Symbol Digit modalities following the standardized guidelines. The main findings suggest the best indicator of passing the clinical boards is the pre-clinic course grade, and the best indicators of success in the pre-clinic course are the Oâ€™Conner Tweezer Dexterity and Symbol Digits Modalities <b>assessment</b> <b>tests.</b> This displays some rationale for selecting a student with better-hands on ability prior to starting the program and {{can be done by}} way of these <b>assessment</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The SAT {{has been}} renamed several times since its {{introduction}} in 1926. It was originally {{known as the}} Scholastic Aptitude Test. In 1990, a commission {{set up by the}} College Board to review the proposed changes to the SAT program recommended that the meaning of the initialism SAT be changed to [...] "Scholastic Assessment Test" [...] because a [...] "test that integrates measures of achievement as well as developed ability can no longer be accurately described as a test of aptitude". In 1993, the College Board changed the name of the test to SAT I: Reasoning Test; at the same time, the name of the Achievement Tests was changed to SAT II: Subject Tests. The Reasoning Test and Subject Tests were to be collectively known as the Scholastic Assessment Tests. According {{to the president of the}} College Board at the time, the name change was meant [...] "to correct the impression among some people that the SAT measures something that is innate and impervious to change regardless of effort or instruction." [...] The new SAT debuted in March 1994, and was referred to as the Scholastic <b>Assessment</b> <b>Test</b> by major news organizations. However, in 1997, the College Board announced that the SAT could not properly be called the Scholastic <b>Assessment</b> <b>Test,</b> and that the letters SAT did not stand for anything. In 2004, the Roman numeral in SAT I: Reasoning Test was dropped, making SAT Reasoning Test the new name of the SAT.|$|E

2500|$|In 2015, {{experimental}} studies reported {{the detection of}} significant episodic (situational) cognitive impairment from impurities in indoor air breathed by test subjects who were not informed about changes in the air quality. Researchers at the Harvard University and SUNY Upstate Medical University and Syracuse University measured the cognitive performance of 24 participants in three different controlled laboratory atmospheres that simulated those found in [...] "conventional" [...] and [...] "green" [...] buildings, as well as green buildings with enhanced ventilation. Performance was evaluated objectively using the widely used Strategic Management Simulation software simulation tool, which is a well-validated <b>assessment</b> <b>test</b> for executive decision-making in an unconstrained situation allowing initiative and improvisation. Significant deficits were observed in the performance scores achieved in increasing concentrations of either volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or carbon dioxide, while keeping other factors constant.

30|$|The {{discrimination}} {{was also}} measured {{for the individual}} questions and the entire <b>assessment</b> <b>tests.</b> The question discrimination indices obtained using the CTT when applied to the three tests administrated to third year undergraduate students (see Tables  13, 14, and 15) had positive values. This indicates that the auto-generated questions may {{not need to be}} reviewed or eliminated from the <b>assessment</b> <b>tests</b> (Doran 1980; Mitkov et al. 2006; Mitkov and Ha 2017). In addition, the three tests had satisfactory average discrimination values above 0.30 (see Tables  16, 17, and 18) which indicates that the questions could efficiently discriminate between high ability and low ability students (Doran 1980; Zhang and Lidbury 2013; Thorndike and Hagen E 2017; Corkins 2009). Similar results were obtained using the IRT, which could be seen in Tables  19, 20, and 21. The results revealed that the questions in the three tests had positive discrimination values and that the auto-generated questions may not need to be reviewed or eliminated from the <b>assessment</b> <b>tests</b> (Baker 2001; Hambleton and Swaminathan 1985).|$|R
30|$|The results {{obtained}} using the CTT {{revealed that the}} three <b>assessment</b> <b>tests</b> formed from the auto-generated questions had medium difficulty values, which {{are very close to}} the value (0.5) that the test authors are advised to achieve when constructing tests Doran (1980); Mitkov et al. (2017); Mitkov et al. (2006). In addition, the results revealed that the questions and tests had satisfactory positive discrimination values, which indicate that the questions and tests could effectively discriminate between high ability and low ability students, and that the questions may not need to be reviewed or eliminated from the <b>assessment</b> <b>tests</b> Doran (1980); Mitkov et al. (2006); Mitkov and Ha (2017). In addition to the CTT, the Item Response Theory (IRT) was used to assess the quality of the auto-generated questions because of its invariant assumption. The IRT analysis revealed similar results to the CTT, as the questions’ discrimination indices had positive values which justify that the auto-generated questions may not need to be reviewed or eliminated from the <b>assessment</b> <b>tests</b> Baker (2001); Hambleton and Swaminathan (1985).|$|R
2500|$|In {{the first}} {{participation}} of Chinese student {{in an international}} student <b>assessment</b> <b>test,</b> the 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment, 15-year-old students from Shanghai ranked first {{in all of the}} three categories: mathematics, science, and reading. The Chinese students scored particularly well compared to other nations in mathematics. One explanation for the Chinese results may be a culture emphasizing education and competitive examinations and more time spent studying in part due to less participation in activities such as sports. Teaching have become a higher status occupation. Also, industrialized Shanghai which has done important educational reforms may not be representative for the rest of China. While {{there was no evidence of}} cheating or technical problems with the testing, Shanghai which attracts many immigrants from the rest of China may have allowed particularly good students to study in the city and the students may have been told that the test was important for China's image. The OECD director of the testing, Andreas Schleicher, said that the results were expected to produce astonishment and had been examined for accuracy by international experts after the OECD received the Shanghai scores. He also said that the results [...] "refute the commonly held hypothesis that China just produces rote learning" [...] and [...] "Large fractions of these students demonstrate their ability to extrapolate from what they know and apply their knowledge very creatively in novel situations".|$|E
2500|$|A 2004 {{meta-analysis}} by Richard Lynn and Paul Irwing {{published in}} 2005 {{found that the}} mean IQ of men exceeded that of women by up to 5 points on the Raven's Progressive Matrices test. Lynn's findings were debated {{in a series of}} articles for Nature. Jackson and Philipe Rushton found that males aged 17–18 years had an average of 3.63 IQ points in excess of their female equivalents on the Scholastic <b>Assessment</b> <b>Test.</b> Irwing (2012) found a 3-point IQ advantage for males in g from subjects aged 16–89 in the United States on the WAIS III test favoring men on the information, arithmetic, and symbol search, and favoring women on the processing speed. A 2005 study by Ian Deary, Paul Irwing, Geoff Der, and Timothy Bates, focusing on the ASVAB showed a significantly higher variance in male scores, resulting in more than twice as many men as women scoring in the top 2%. The study also found a very small (d' ≈ 0.07, less than 7%, of a standard deviation) average male advantage in g on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery test. [...] Another study by researcher Jianghong Liu also found 3 points higher male scores on the WISC, which is the children's version of the WAIS III. He stated that greater male performance on items such as Picture Arrangement, Object Assembly, Picture Completion and Block Design is because these tests measure visual-spatial abilities in which males typically perform better than females.|$|E
