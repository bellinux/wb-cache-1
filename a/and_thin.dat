50|$|This was {{followed}} by decompressions which occurred due to uplift related to the gradual stretching <b>and</b> <b>thinning</b> of the crust as rifting continued. Stretching <b>and</b> <b>thinning</b> can take place either according to a symmetrical, pure shear, extension model, or due to an asymmetric, detachment-delamination model. Basaltic dykes are also injected during the stretching <b>and</b> <b>thinning.</b>|$|R

5|$|B.brownii usually grows as {{an upright}} bush {{between one and}} three metres (3–10ft) high, {{but it can also}} grow as an openly {{branched}} small tree to six metres (20ft) in sheltered gullies, or as a low, spreading shrub in exposed locations such as the peaks of the Stirling Range. The bark is a grey-brown colour, smooth <b>and</b> <b>thin,</b> with lenticels. The leaves are long <b>and</b> <b>thin,</b> from three to ten centimetres (1–5in) long, and five to ten millimetres (–in) wide. Dark green and hairless above but with a hairy white underside, they are easily recognised by their feather-like appearance, caused {{by the fact that they}} are finely divided almost back to the midrib, into as many as 70 thin tapered lobes.|$|E
5|$|From the {{earliest}} days, the line's colours were: funnels– dark red with black top <b>and</b> <b>thin</b> black band; hulls– black with white boot topping.

From the 1960s onwards, some ships' hulls were painted light grey and others red.|$|E

5|$|Pigs {{were the}} primary meat eaten by early Welsh folk, which could be {{preserved}} easily by salting. By 1700, {{there were a number}} of different Welsh breeds of pig, with long snouts <b>and</b> <b>thin</b> backs, generally light coloured, but some were dark or spotted. Today, pigs in Wales are either farmed intensively, using the white Welsh pig or Landrace pig, or extensively, where Saddleback pig, Welsh pig or crossbreeds are farmed.|$|E

5|$|A 2017 study {{examined}} the histology of thin-sectioned dodo bones, modern Mauritian birds, local ecology, and contemporary accounts, to recover information about the life history of the dodo. The study suggested that dodos bred around August, after having potentially fattened themselves, corresponding with the fat <b>and</b> <b>thin</b> cycles of many vertebrates of Mauritius. The chicks grew rapidly, reaching robust, almost adult, sizes, and sexual maturity before Austral summer or the cyclone season. Adult dodos which had just bred moulted after Austral summer, around March. The feathers of the wings and tail were replaced first, and the moulting would have completed {{at the end of}} July, in time for the next breeding season. Different stages of moulting may also account for inconsistencies in contemporary descriptions of dodo plumage.|$|E
5|$|A tall <b>and</b> <b>thin</b> off spinner, Trumble {{delivered}} {{the ball at}} a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. He was at his best on the softer pitches of England, but his accuracy and variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia. He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, {{with a penchant for}} practical jokes.|$|E
5|$|Calabozos and the {{majority}} of the Andean volcanoes formed from the subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate under the continental South American continental lithosphere. The caldera is in a transitional region between thick <b>and</b> <b>thin</b> lithosphere, and is probably supplied by a pool of andesitic and rhyolitic magma. It sits on a historic bed of volcanic and plutonic sedimentary rock (rock formed within the Earth) that in turn sits on top of a layer of merged sedimentary and metamorphic rock.|$|E

5|$|Calabozos lies in an {{area between}} thick <b>and</b> <b>thin</b> {{continental}} crust, and its eruptions are probably fed {{from a pool of}} andesitic and rhyolitic magma that sits just under its caldera. The caldera is underlain by a layer of volcaniclastic sedimentary rock from the Mesozoic era coalesced with intrusive and volcanic rocks of Tertiary age, over a layer of Precambrian-Triassic sedimentary and metamorphic rock formed from later plutons (magma intrusions). Under its northeast edge, Calabozos is cut by a north-south trending segment of sedimentary rock that includes gypsiferous and carbonates.|$|E
5|$|Distinctive {{features}} of Ehrhardt include an 'A' with gently curving bar matching the centre-link of the 'B', a wide 'T' with spreadeagled serifs {{on either side}} and a 'b' with no foot on the left. In italic the 'J' has a crossbar, the 'w' has sharp reverse curves towards the top and left, and the 'v' has a flourish on the left. The face has high stroke contrast (difference between thick <b>and</b> <b>thin</b> strokes) {{by the standards of}} most old-style serif fonts. In order to allow compact line spacing, descenders were kept reasonably short.|$|E
5|$|Female {{individuals}} of Laevistrombus canarium are generally larger (both shell and soft parts) than male individuals, {{which is also}} the case in other strombid gastropods such as the spider conch (Harpago chiragra) and queen conch (Lobatus gigas). The external anatomy of the soft parts of this species {{is similar to that of}} the other members of the family: the animal has a long extensible snout <b>and</b> <b>thin</b> eyestalks (also known as ommatophores), with well-developed lens eyes at the tips. Each eyestalk has a small sensory tentacle branching off near the end. The large foot of the animal is narrow and strong, able to perform the leaping form of locomotion that is also found in other species of Strombidae (such as the queen conch).|$|E
