5|$|Ministry of Interior {{proposed}} {{a constitutional amendment}} on 15 December 2016 aimed at providing constitutional right to acquire, possess and carry firearms. The proposed law would, if passed, <b>add</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> section to Constitutional Act No. 110/1998 Col., on Security of the Czech Republic, expressly providing {{the right to be}} armed as part of citizen's duty of participation in provision of internal order, security and democratic order.|$|E
5|$|To {{minimize}} {{the impact of}} the structure, Pei demanded a method of glass production that resulted in clear panes. The pyramid was constructed {{at the same time as}} the subterranean levels below, which caused difficulties during the building stages. As they worked, construction teams came upon an abandoned set of rooms containing 25,000historical items; these were incorporated into the rest of the structure to <b>add</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> exhibition zone.|$|E

5|$|In {{memory of}} Henry II, Catherine decided to <b>add</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> chapel to the {{basilica}} of Saint Denis, where {{the kings of}} France were traditionally buried. As the centrepiece of this circular chapel, sometimes known as the Valois rotunda, she commissioned a magnificent and innovative tomb for Henry and herself. The design of this tomb should be understood {{in the context of}} its planned setting. The plan was to integrate the tomb's effigies of the king and queen with other statues throughout the chapel, creating a vast spatial composition. Catherine's approval would have been essential for such a departure from funerary tradition.|$|E
5|$|To {{resolve the}} problem of overcrowding, the station began upgrade works in 2017. This {{includes}} a new northern exit/entrance on the north-west corner of Victoria Street, accessible via a new additional ticket office under Bressenden Place leading to both the Victoria line and the Circle and District line platforms. This upgrade is due to be finished by 2018, and tunnelling for the project was completed in September 2015. The work involved enlarging the existing Victoria line ticket hall serving the railway station and <b>add</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> relief bank of escalators there, which opened in January 2017. The redevelopment has been criticised, as access to platforms from the new escalators will be long and indirect compared to the direct access using the existing escalators.|$|E

5|$|The {{story was}} {{originally}} conceived by Jun Maeda, who also wrote the screenplay and composed {{some of the}} music, with original character design by Na-Ga. Both Maeda and Na-Ga are from the visual novel brand Key, and Charlotte is the second original anime series created by Key following Angel Beats! in 2010. Maeda had thought up the concept for Charlotte long before he was approached in early 2012 to work on another anime series after Angel Beats!. Maeda narrowed down the number of main characters compared to Angel Beats! and attempted to put more of a focus on their behavior. Instead of employing the same staff that had worked on Angel Beats!, the aim for Charlotte was to bring together a staff that would <b>add</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> variety to the creative process to prevent being influenced by the work done on Angel Beats!.|$|E
5|$|When the {{computer}} was not in use, contents of the memory were preserved {{as long as the}} main lead-acid battery remained charged. The PowerBook100 Power Manager was an integrated circuit, usually placed on the logic board of a PowerBook, and was responsible for the power management of {{the computer}}. Identical to that of the Macintosh Portable, it controlled the display's backlight, hard drive spin-down, sleep and wake, battery charging, trackball control, and input/output (I/O). The 100 did <b>add</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> feature: 3.5V batteries backed up permanent and expansion random access memory (RAM) when the PowerBook100's battery was being replaced or when the 100 was otherwise temporarily removed from all power sources. This made it a perfect candidate for use with Apple's RAM disk to help increase battery life by accessing the hard disk less frequently, since the 100 was the only PowerBook that maintained the contents of RAM on shutdown in order to reduce startup time.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} {{writing the}} dialogue, Takumi was called into another meeting with Inaba, {{and was told}} to <b>add</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> gameplay mechanic to the investigations. Takumi {{wanted to keep the}} gameplay simple enough for his mother {{to be able to play}} it, and keep it focused on the core concept of finding lies; according to him, he immediately had a vision of the psyche lock system during the meeting with Inaba, but still asked for three days to come up with an idea. He found it easy to formulate the idea, but it took over a month to create the system; the biggest problem was how to visually represent the psyche locks. Takumi also drew storyboards for the episodes' openings, which consisted of series of detailed drawings that show what is happening. He also drew rough sketches of cut-in illustrations; it was only decided after all the text had been written what scenes would have illustrations made for them. While the game's opening features the judge, it was originally supposed to have featured a demon instead; this was because Takumi was playing Devil May Cry at the time, and had liked its opening. As Takumi wanted the first three Ace Attorney games to be part of one larger work, he did not want the first game to look outdated in comparison to later ones, so it was decided to keep the same graphics for main characters such as Phoenix, Maya and Edgeworth throughout all their appearances, and not make updates to them. The game's music was composed by Naoto Tanaka under the pseudonym Akemi Kimura.|$|E

5|$|When {{deciding}} on Charlotte staff, Toba {{thought it would}} be better not to have exactly the same team that produced Angel Beats!. Having already decided to stick with Maeda, Na-Ga and P.A.Works, Toba aimed to bring together a staff that would <b>add</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> variety to the creative process, and in doing so would prevent being influenced by the work done on Angel Beats!. With that in mind, Toba wanted a director who had a good understanding of Angel Beats! and who would also be suitable as Charlotte director, leading him to seek out Yoshiyuki Asai. Toba took into consideration the storyboarding Asai had done for two episodes of Angel Beats!, and he thought that Charlotte would be a good opportunity to have a first-time series director. Asai was also chosen as someone who could handle both comedic and serious moments. When Horikawa first looked at Charlotte incomplete script, he told Maeda that it did not feel like it had the same kind of zeal that Angel Beats! had. However, once he saw the whole script, his concerns with it were dispelled, much to Maeda's relief.|$|E
