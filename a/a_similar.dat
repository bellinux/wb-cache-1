5000|$|The phylogenetic {{knowledge}} of Deinococcus ficus stems from its accidental discovery. After undergoing multiple rounds of phylogenetic analysis with 16S rRNA gene sequence, Deinococcus ficus CC-FR2-10T {{was placed in}} the genus Deinococcus due to similarities in resistance of UV-light, gamma radiation, and desiccation. Deinococcus ficus has a number of close relatives including D. grandis with <b>a</b> 96.1% <b>similar</b> 16S rRNA gene sequence, D. radiodurans with <b>a</b> 94.3% <b>similar</b> 16S rRNA gene sequence, D. radiopugnans with <b>a</b> 93.2% <b>similar</b> 16S rRNA gene sequence, D. indicus with <b>a</b> 93.0% <b>similar</b> 16S rRNA gene sequence, D. proteolyticus with <b>a</b> 92.5% <b>similar</b> 16S rRNA gene sequence, D. murrayi with <b>a</b> 92.4% <b>similar</b> 16S rRNA gene sequence, and D. geothermal is with <b>a</b> 90.7% <b>similar</b> 16S rRNA gene sequence to that of D. ficus. [...] As observed through high-performance liquid chromatography, D. ficus is further related to its fellow members of the Deinococcus genus through their mutual utilization of menaquinone (MK-8), a related compound of vitamin K2 found in fermented foods, as their major quinone.|$|R

40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} {{is characterized by}} <b>an</b> <b>similar</b> to 60 % loss of beta-cell mass, a marked defect in postprandial insulin secretion, and a failure to suppress postprandial glucagon concentrations. It is possible that postprandial. hyperglucagonemia in type 2 {{diabetes is}} due to impaired postprandial insulin secretion. To address this, we studied eight adult Goettingen minipigs before and after an - 60 % reduction in beta-cell mass induced by illoxan. Pigs were studied fasting and after ingestion of a mixed meal. Insulin and glucagon secretion were determined by deconvolution of blood hormone concentrations measured at 1 -min intervals. The relationship between insulin and glucagon release was analyzed using cross-correlation and forward versus reverse cross-approximate entropy. We report that glucagon and insulin were secreted in similar to 4 -min pulses. Prealloxan, postprandial insulin secretion drove <b>an</b> <b>similar</b> to 20 % suppression of glucagon concentrations (P < 0. 01), through inhibition of glucagon pulse mass. The alloxan-induced similar to 60 % deficit in beta-cell mass lead to <b>an</b> <b>similar</b> to 70 % deficit in postprandia insulin secretion and loss of the postprandial insulin-driven suppression of glucagon secretion. We conclude that postprandial hyperglucagonemia in type 2 diabetes is likely due to loss of intraislet postprandial suppression of glucagon secretion by insulin...|$|R
