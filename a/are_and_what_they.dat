5|$|Cox {{has stated}} that the film is {{primarily}} about a love story between two characters. There is also an exploration of religious attitudes towards homosexuality, and the dilemma of religious homosexuals, torn between who they <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> believe. A non-fiction film with similar themes that has been contrasted with Latter Days is Trembling Before G-d.|$|E
25|$|A seventh step {{could in}} {{principle}} be added, namely a big crisis in society which sparks off a revolution and overturns the existing capitalist system. In that case, {{it could be}} argued, the false masks are torn off, and people {{have to stand up}} for what they really <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> really believe in. But that is a possibility which Marx did not comprehensively theorize in Das Kapital.|$|E
500|$|... "Illuminati" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer and songwriter Madonna for her thirteenth studio album Rebel Heart (2015). It was written by Madonna Ciccone, Toby Gad, Maureen McDonald, Larry Griffin Jr., Mike Dean, Kanye West, Ernest Brown and Jacques Webster. The song was produced by Madonna, West, Dean and Symbolyc One, with co-production by Charlie Heat and additional production by Travis Scott. The song's demo was leaked to the internet in December 2014, with twelve other tracks from the album. Its final version was released on December 20, 2014, with five other tracks on iTunes store as [...] "an early Christmas gift" [...] to avoid further leaks. The song's demo version features dance synths and acoustic guitars; after showing the song to West, he felt connected to the song and changed it to a darker sound. The song was conceived after Madonna was {{accused of being a}} member of the Illuminati; she wanted to write a song about who they really <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are not.|$|E

2500|$|The {{dismantling}} of the false self [...] "leaves the impaired real self {{with the opportunity to}} convert its potential and its possibilities into actualities." [...] Working through brings unique rewards, of which the most important element is the growing realization that the individual has a fundamental, internal need for relatedness that may be expressed in a variety of ways. [...] "Only schizoid patients", suggests Klein, [...] "who have worked through the abandonment depression... ultimately will believe that the capacity for relatedness and the wish for relatedness are woven into the structure of their beings, that they are truly part of who the patients <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> contain as human beings. It is this sense that finally allows the schizoid patient to feel the most intimate sense of being connected with humanity more generally, and with another person more personally. For the schizoid patient, this degree of certainty is the most gratifying revelation, and a profound new organizer of the self experience." ...|$|E

2500|$|Regulated {{genes are}} {{categorized}} {{in terms of}} what they <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> do, important relationships between genes may emerge. For example, we might see evidence that a certain gene creates a protein to make an enzyme that activates a protein [...] to turn on a second gene on our list. This second gene may [...] be a transcription factor that regulates yet another gene from our list. Observing these links we may begin to suspect that they represent much more than chance associations in the results, and that they are all on our list because of an underlying biological process. On the other hand, it could be that if one selected genes at random, one might find many that seem to have something in common. In this sense, we need rigorous statistical procedures to test whether the emerging biological themes is significant or not. That is where gene set analysis comes in.|$|E
2500|$|Vincent Canby {{praised the}} look of the film in his review for The New York Times, writing, [...] "the movie, which looks {{as if it had been}} made on an A-picture budget, has a lot of the zest one {{associates}} with special-effects-filled B-pictures". Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars out of four and wrote, [...] "This movie takes a lot of delight in being more psychologically complex than it has to be. It contains fights and shootouts and big chase scenes, but they're all firmly centered on who the characters <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> mean to one another". In his review for the Globe and Mail, Jay Scott wrote, [...] "F/X is simply out to give a good time, which it does superbly". Paul Attanasio in his review for the Washington Post praised Brian Dennehy's performance: [...] "Dennehy brings magic to the role - he's large, and he enlarges it. With his sly eyes and little can opener of a nose, his shoulders a yard wide, his hair massing in gray curls behind his ears, he dances through the movie like a mastodon in toe shoes". In his review for The Sunday Times, George Perry praised the film's premise as a [...] "nice idea, but the effects themselves are merely ingenious when they might have been spectacular". Sheila Benson wrote in her review for the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Where F/X floats above the crowd are in its performances; in the perfection of Miroslav Ondricek's photography, Mel Bourne's production design, John Stears' effects and Terry Rawlings' crisp, succinct editing; in the virtually unpredictable twists and turns of its plot, and in the sheer joy of watching a hero use his skill and his wits to solve a problem".|$|E

This was a long day's ride; and the house where I wished to sleep was some way off the road, and not easily found. I met on this occasion, and indeed on all others, a very general and ready civility among the lower orders, which, when one considers what they <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> have been, would scarcely have been expected. The farm where I passed the night was owned by two young men who had only lately come out, and were beginning a settler's life. The total want of almost every comfort was not very attractive; but future and certain prosperity was before their eyes, and that not far distant.|$|E
