5|$|English pronouns {{conserve}} many {{traits of}} case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain {{a difference between}} subjective and objective case in most persons (I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them) as well as <b>a</b> <b>gender</b> and animateness distinction {{in the third person}} singular (distinguishing he/she/it). The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective case is used both {{in the sense of the}} previous accusative case (in the role of patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and in the sense of the Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb). Subjective case is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, and otherwise the objective case is used. While grammarians such as Henry Sweet and Otto Jespersen noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example , retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} reasons for women's {{migration}} from Korea to the UK. It is difficult to explain away this migration with the common rationales, such as <b>a</b> <b>gendered</b> international division of labour or a strong political/colonial relationship between two countries. This study proposes <b>a</b> <b>gendered</b> desire approach to understand young women's migration: rather than a single motivating factor such as an economic purpose, the desire for new way of life-including the expectation of better social circumstances as well as realistic needs for future careers-triggers women's migration. I will look at individual migrant women's life stories, applying the biographical approach {{within the framework of}} gendered desire. Their memories of family, school life, and work show how the Korean social atmosphere emphasises becoming a "global citizen" influences these women's migration in <b>a</b> <b>gendered</b> way.

25|$|In the United Kingdom, the Gender Recognition Act 2004 {{allows a}} person who has lived in their chosen gender {{for at least two years}} to receive <b>a</b> <b>gender</b> {{recognition}} certificate officially recognizing their new gender.

Such people are then free to enter or re-enter civil partnerships or marriages in accordance with their newly recognized gender identity.

40|$|The {{construction}} of boys as <b>a</b> <b>gendered</b> {{culture is not}} usually associated with neuroscience. Exceptions are publications and presentations by consultants on boys’ education who adopt a “brain-based” perspective. From a neuroscience perspective, my analysis indicates the selective use of primary neuroscience research to construct and perpetuate generalisations and stereotypic representations of boys as <b>a</b> <b>gendered</b> culture. In this article I draw on data obtained over 12 months from a boys’ school that engaged a consultant on boys’ education. The consultant selectively used neuroscience to construct a hegemonic discourse that constructed boys as <b>a</b> <b>gendered</b> culture. I analyse the consultant’s professional learning sessions, question the veracity of populist claims presented to teachers and indicate {{the degree to which}} this discourse about boys’ literacy ability and behaviour influenced the school as they revised their language policy and made commercial decisions. My observations suggest that, {{over the course of a}} year, the school uncritically accepted sufficient popular interpretations of primary neuroscience research to fulfil their intention of building <b>a</b> marketable, <b>gendered</b> school culture. I further note the existence of a parallel cognitive discourse around principles of learning that influenced teacher pedagogy. These two discourses allowed the school to meet its aims of i) building <b>a</b> <b>gendered</b> educational culture at a school for boys, ii) placing the school in a competitive education market (both primarily based on the discourse of neuroscience) and iii) meeting the educational needs of their students (based primarily on the discourse of cognitive psychology) ...|$|R
