500|$|The {{military}} films generated {{only enough}} revenue to cover costs, and the feature film Bambiwhich {{had been in}} production since 1937underperformed on its release in April 1942, and lost $200,000 at the box office. On top of the low earnings from Pinocchio and Fantasia, the company had debts of $4million with the Bank of America in 1944. At a meeting with Bank of America executives to discuss {{the future of the}} company, the bank's chairman and founder, Amadeo Giannini, told his executives, [...] "I've been watching the Disneys' pictures quite closely because I knew we were lending them money far above the financial risk.... They're good this year, they're good next year, and they're good the year <b>after....</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> to relax and give them time to market their product." [...] Disney's production of short films decreased in the late 1940s, coinciding with increasing competition in the animation market from Warner Bros. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Roy Disney, for financial reasons, suggested more combined animation and live-action productions. In 1948, Disney initiated a series of popular live-action nature films, titled True-Life Adventures, with Seal Island the first; the film won the Academy Award in the Best Short Subject (Two-Reel) category.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his review}} in the New York Times, A. O. Scott called it a [...] "modest, {{touching}} film" [...] and added, [...] "Many of [...] elements [...] [...] [...] seem to promise a sticky bath of shameless sentimentality. But instead, thanks to Jim Sheridan's graceful, scrupulously sincere direction and the dry intelligence of his cast, In America is likely to pierce the defenses of {{all but the most}} dogmatically cynical viewers [...] [...] [...] Mr. Sheridan is more interested in particular people than in general plights, and what lingers in the mind <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> seen his movies is the rough, radiant individuality of his characters [...] [...] [...] This movie, from moment to moment, feels small, almost anecdotal. It is only afterward that, like Mr. Sheridan's other films, it starts to grow into something at once unassuming and in its own way grand." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{approach}} earned {{praise from}} two influential intellectual {{figures of the}} Romanian diaspora, critics Monica Lovinescu and Virgil Ierunca, whose letter to the author read: [...] "the distances you take from your own background are of most-rare authenticity and tact. You accomplish a radical break, being {{at the same time}} participative, negating things only <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> understood them, being dissociated from both roles of judge and defense counsel." [...] Cioroianu also notes: [...] "He is not the only son of (relatively) well-known communists; but {{he is one of the}} few to have reached the level of detachment needed in order to X-ray, in a cold and precise way, a political system. Does this seem easy to you? I do not know how many of us would be capable of introspecting with such lucidity our own parents' utopias, phantasms and disappointments". The historian opposes Tismăneanu's approach to that of Petre Roman, Romania-s first post-1989 Premier, whose attempts at discussing the public image of his father, the communist politico Valter Roman, are argued by Cioroianu to have [...] "failed".|$|E
2500|$|I {{have had}} a most happy life and I want each one of {{you to have a}} happy life too. I believe that God put us in this jolly world to be happy and enjoy life. Happiness does not come from being rich, nor merely being {{successful}} in your career, nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make yourself healthy and strong while you are a boy, so that you can be useful and so you can enjoy life when you are a man. Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. [...] "Be prepared" [...] in this way, to live happy and to die happy– stick to your Scout Promise always– even <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> ceased to be a boy– and God help you to do it.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson {{works out}} [...] "about a third" [...] of the {{finished}} arrangement of a song as he's writing it, leaving the rest to studio experimentation. As he writes in 1990: [...] "Making an instrumental track is a whole experience. It starts <b>after</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> written a song. As I write a song, I write some of the instrumental piano and pluck some of the different notes for the arrangement. It's impossible to lay the whole arrangement on the piano but you play just {{enough to get the}} overall feelin’ of the record. It is an art in itself. I always get that bigger picture of my records at my piano before I record them. I go in there prepared." [...] From the very beginning, Wilson handled most stages of the group's recording process, despite Nik Venet being credited for producing their early recordings. He preferred mixing live as performances were recorded, as opposed to mixing after the fact. He was open to changes suggested by others while recording, often taking advice and even incorporating apparent mistakes if they provided a useful or interesting alternative. On Surfin' U.S.A. (1963), Brian began doubletracking. As was practiced by other record producers from the 1960s, most of his mixes ended up in single-channel monaural, believing that varied stereo speaker placement took his control over the sound image away to the listener.|$|E
