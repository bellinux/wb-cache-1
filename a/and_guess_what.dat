500|$|Karen Allen, who {{previously}} appeared in Raiders of the Lost Ark, reprises {{the role of}} Marion Ravenwood (under the married name of Marion Williams). Frank Darabont's script introduced the idea of Marion returning as Indiana's love interest. Allen was not aware her character was in the script until Spielberg called her in January 2007, saying, [...] "It's been announced! We're gonna make Indiana Jones 4! <b>And</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what?</b> You're in it!" [...] Ford found Allen [...] "one of the easiest people to work with [...] ever known. She's a completely self-sufficient woman, and that's part of the character she plays. A lot of her charm and the charm of the character is there. And again, it's not an age-dependent thing. It {{has to do with}} her spirit and her nature." [...] Allen found Ford easier to work with on this film, than in Raiders.|$|E
500|$|... "The Job" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Lieberstein and Michael Schur. It was {{directed}} by Ken Kwapis, who had, around the same time, directed The Office actor John Krasinski in the 2007 film License to Wed. Script reading for the episode took place on a beach during the filming of the season's twenty-third episode, [...] "Beach Games". Actress Kate Flannery remarked that [...] "we were so excited that we almost had another hot dog eating contest. Not. It's a great script. Lots of questions answered. Lots. The Office fans have been anxiously awaiting a one-hour episode, <b>and</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what?</b> You got it." [...] The original cut of the episode was an hour and twelve minutes long, {{and had to be}} edited down to forty-two minutes of screentime. It was the second Office episode to fill the entire hour timeslot; the first was the third-season episode [...] "A Benihana Christmas".|$|E
500|$|Coming from a {{relatively}} Catholic district, Neal {{has a more}} conservative record {{on the issue of}} abortion than other Massachusetts representatives. He said in 2010, [...] "I have always opposed taxpayer funding of abortion. I'd keep Roe v. Wade and restrict it, I've always thought: keep abortion, with restrictions for late-term abortion. [...] the voting pattern I have, both sides would say I'm mixed <b>and</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what?</b> That's where the American people are." [...] He voted for the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, which made the intact dilation and extraction abortion procedure illegal in most cases. During debate on the House health care reform bill, he voted in favor of the Stupak–Pitts Amendment, restricting government funding of abortion. On other social issues Neal has a moderate record: he supports a proposed Constitutional amendment to ban desecration of the U.S. flag, and has twice voted against an amendment to ban same-sex marriage.|$|E

500|$|When the LRDG {{was based}} at Siwa, they {{took part in}} what has since {{became known as the}} 'Road Watch' along the Via Balbia (the Tripoli to Benghazi road). Three patrols were engaged on road watch duties at any one time, with one {{watching}} the road for a week to 10 days, another would be en route to relieve them and the third was returning to Siwa after having been relieved. The site of the road watch was about [...] from the Marble Arch monument. The road watch patrol would park about 2 miles away from the road and the trucks would be camouflaged using camouflage nets, any local foliage and sand. Before dawn each day two men would move into a well camouflaged position about [...] from the road. By day they would record the details of all vehicles and troop movements, and at night they would move to about [...] from the road <b>and</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> type of vehicles were passing by their sound and outline. At daylight they were relieved by another pair of men who took over that day's road watch.|$|E
2500|$|Flynn {{identified}} Zoë Heller's Notes on a Scandal and Edward Albee's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? as {{influences on}} her writing and, in particular, on the plot and themes of Gone Girl. Flynn said she admired the [...] "ominous" [...] ending of Notes on a Scandal and the pathology {{of a bad}} marriage from Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. For the conclusion of Gone Girl, Flynn drew from Rosemary's Baby: [...] "I love that it just ends with, you know, 'Hey, the devil's in the world, <b>and</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what?</b> Mom kind of likes him!'" [...] she said.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2001 {{interview}} with The Guardian, Morricone {{stated that he}} had good experiences with De Palma: [...] "De Palma is delicious! He respects music, he respects composers. For The Untouchables, everything I proposed to him was fine, but then he wanted a piece that I didn't like at all, {{and of course we}} didn't have an agreement on that. It was something I didn't want to write – a triumphal piece for the police. I think I wrote nine different pieces for this in total and I said, 'Please don't choose the seventh!' because it was the worst. <b>And</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> he chose? The seventh one. But it really suits the movie." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Mayor of Where - Long running {{feature that}} began in early 2014. Greg and Chris get a mayor on the phone, and ask them five {{questions}} in order to ascertain their 'mayorabouts' <b>and</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> town they are the mayor of. This used to happen on a Thursday, but was moved to Wednesday to create time on Thursday's show for the fired Apprentice candidates, and was never returned to its original slot. When the mayor is Scottish, the feature is renamed [...] "The Provost of Wovost", and when a mayor is unavailable, the feature is replaced with [...] "The Claire of Where", [...] "The Clown From Which Town" [...] or in December 2016, [...] "The Dame From The Town Of What Name" [...] when Greg and Chris had to guess which town a pantomime dame was performing in.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes, the buzzers have unique {{points to}} them, {{such as having}} {{questions}} based on them; in most cases they are usually about Davies' own, such as for example, one of his buzzer noises in the Series D episode [...] "Descendants" [...] sounded like a Clanger, and the panel had to try <b>and</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> was being said, while in the Series F episode [...] "Fakes and Frauds", all the buzzers sounded like ordinary household objects, but three {{turned out to be}} the sound of the superb lyrebird mimicking the noises. In other episodes, they were sometimes changed to suit the theme of an episode; for the Series D episode [...] "Denial and Deprivation", the panelists had to use unique buzzers - two had bells, one flicked a ruler over the edge of a school desk, and Davies squeezed a toy chipmunk - while in the Series G episode [...] "Green", the buzzers were replaced with whistles so the show could be eco-friendly.|$|E

2500|$|Writing for The Daily Telegraph, Ben Lawrence {{noted that}} [...] "'Kill the Moon' was an {{excellent}} example of Doctor Who reaching out to different generations, something it hasn't always done in recent weeks." [...] He felt Coleman was [...] "terrific" [...] and that Capaldi added further layers of complexity to his character. Lawrence stated that the guests were underdeveloped, but concluded that, [...] "it lacked the clever-cleverness that has marred recent episodes and proved how good Doctor Who can be when it simply tells a story." [...] Dan Martin, writing for The Guardian, stated that [...] "Clara's outburst was the next stage in what I have loved about this series most of all. More than ever before, they're playing out the reality of running off to fight aliens with a time-travelling space detective. <b>And,</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what,</b> this life is not all wine and roses." [...] Martin noted that Coleman has been terrific all series stating that [...] "We no longer need to make note of just how good Jenna is this year; she’s already established herself in pantheon of all-time great companions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gina Sepre of E! Online {{praised the}} {{performance}} saying, [...] "When Adele {{took the stage}} to perform her understatedly stripped-down and hugely impactful performance of 'Someone Like You,' there were no pyrotechnics, no acrobatics, no lavender hair, and no autotune. <b>And</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what?</b> We didn't miss it. There may be hope yet for MTV to remember just what the 'M' in their name actually stands for." [...] Writing about the performance, Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound concluded that [...] "Someone like You", [...] "highlighted the power a bare-bones, booming performance can have in netting people's attention. Simple {{is not a bad}} word, pop music." [...] Giving the performance an A+, Lindsey Ward of Jam! said: [...] "When I learned British chart-topper Adele would be performing at Sunday's awards I thought, 'Whew – at least we're guaranteed five solid, meaningful minutes of quality music television'. I was right; her frill-free performance of breakup ballad Someone Like You was just that." [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly highlighted the performance calling it [...] "one of the best performances of the show." [...] Another writer of the same publication gave the performance a grade of A+ and wrote: [...] "It takes a real super power to make the seizure-inducing lasers stop, and that power's name is Adele. The broadcast temporarily abandoned its frantic mission of nonstop overstimulation, bowing to the 23-year-old English soulstress's soaring, nearly a cappella (well done, subtle piano man) rendition of her heart-wrecking ballad [...] "Someone Like You." [...] In a modest black dress and with a few spare hand movements, she delivered all the shock and awe of a million-watt showstopper. Who needs special effects, when God gave you your own? Even Britney Spears looked like she had to fix her mascara when it was all over." ...|$|E
