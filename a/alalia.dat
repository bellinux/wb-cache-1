5|$|Stuttering (<b>alalia</b> syllabaris), {{also known}} as {{stammering}} (<b>alalia</b> literalis or anarthria literalis), is a speech disorder in which the flow of speech is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases, and involuntary silent pauses or blocks during which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds. The exact etiology of stuttering is unknown; both genetics and neurophysiology are thought to contribute. There are many treatments and speech-language pathology techniques available that may help increase fluency in some stutterers {{to the point where}} an untrained ear cannot identify a problem; however, there is essentially no cure for the disorder at present.|$|E

25|$|Their sea {{travel was}} extensive. To the south they {{probably}} conducted {{trade with the}} Greek colony of Naucratis in Egypt, which was the colony of their fellow Ionian city Miletus. To the north, they probably helped settle Amisos (Samsun) on the Black Sea, and Lampsacus {{at the north end}} of the Hellespont (now the Dardanelles). However Phocaea's major colonies were to the west. These included <b>Alalia</b> in Corsica, Emporiae and Rhoda in Spain, and especially Massalia (Marseille) in France.|$|E

Having helped out Heinz, he then tells them where to find Echsenfriedl and even offers his daughter Ayn {{as a guide to}} the location.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} that {{contacts}} started even earlier however, as Ionian Greeks traded in the Western Mediterranean and Spain, but only very little remains from that earlier period. Contacts developed undisputedly from 600 BC, between the Celts and Celto-Ligurans and the Greeks {{in the city of}} Marseille and their other colonies such as Agde, Nice, Antibes, Monaco, Emporiae and Rhoda. The Greeks from Phocaea also founded settlements in the island of Corsica, such as at <b>Alalia.</b> From Massalia, the Phocaean Greeks also founded cities in northeastern Spain such as Emporiae and Rhoda.|$|E
25|$|The mythical Greek {{colony of}} Mainake existed {{for at least}} two centuries. The name appears to be derived from the Greek: μαίνη (maínē). There are several ancient {{documents}} that mention its existence and discuss its intensive commercial activity. Strabo and other ancient historians placed it east of Malaka, but recent archaeological investigations suggest that the site of the 8th century BC Phoenician settlement at Cerro del Villar, less than 5 kilometres (3miles) west of the original site of Malaka, corresponds to the location of the Greek colony. According to the ancient sources it was gradually abandoned after the battle of <b>Alalia</b> and the consequent collapse of the Phocaean Greek trade, which led the native inhabitants to shift their residence to the Phoenician-Punic Malaka.|$|E
25|$|Carthage's {{failure to}} prevent the {{establishment}} of Massalia by Phocaean Greeks in 600 BC had created a rival that eventually came to dominate trade in Gaul and to plant colonies in Catalonia, at Mainke near Málaga, three colonies {{near the mouth of}} Sucro, and at <b>Alalia</b> in Corsica. Greek piracy had forced Carthage to team up with the Etruscans to drive the Greeks from Corsica, and destroy the colony at Mainke in Iberia. By 490 BC, Massalia had managed to defeat Carthage twice, and a boundary along Cape Nao in Iberia was agreed upon, while Carthage had closed the Straits of Gibraltar to foreign shipping. Massalia had become friendly with Rome over the years, if not an outright ally by 237 BC, and this connection would become a significant factor in the power politics of the region.|$|E
2500|$|When the Phoenician city-states of {{the eastern}} Mediterranean were assimilated into the Persian empire in the 6th century BC, Carthage took {{advantage}} of their diminishing control over maritime trade. For two hundred years the Phoenician settlements had maintained close relationships with the [...] "mother cities" [...] {{on the coast of}} Syria and Lebanon, but from the mid-6th century, these connections shifted to the north African city of Carthage as it expanded its hegemony. With the arrival of the Magonid dynasty around 550 BC, Carthaginian foreign policy seems to have changed dramatically. Carthage now took the lead, establishing itself as the dominant Phoenician military power in the western Mediterranean. Although a Punic-Etruscan fleet of 120 ships was defeated by a Greek force of Phocaean ships in the naval Battle of <b>Alalia</b> between 540 BC and 535 BC, and Carthage lost [...] two more major naval battles with Massalia, it still managed to close the Strait of Gibraltar to Greek shipping and thus contained the Greek expansion in Spain by 480 BC.|$|E

50|$|Mago I, {{a general}} of the army, had assumed power in Carthage by 550 BC.

50|$|The Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor (modern Turkey) {{had founded}} the colony of Massalia around 600 BC, which the Carthaginians had {{tried and failed}} to prevent. Massalia became a {{thriving}} trading center and a major rival of Carthage for the Spanish markets and the tin trade through Gaul. The Phocaeans also planted a colony in <b>Alalia</b> in Corsica around 562 BC. When the city of Phocaea itself fell to Cyrus the Great of Persia in 546 BC, most Phoceans moved to <b>Alalia,</b> partly because they were on good terms with the Greek colonies along the Strait of Messina and had even been granted toll-free passage. Later, after the battle, in 540 BC, they founded Elea in southern Italy (Magna Grecia).|$|E
50|$|Around 540 BC, the Battle of <b>Alalia</b> {{led to a}} new {{distribution}} {{of power in the}} western Mediterranean Sea.
