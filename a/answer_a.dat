5|$|In 2004, Philbin {{returned}} to host 12 episodes of a spin-off program titled Who Wants to Be a Super Millionaire in which contestants could potentially win $10,000,000. ABC aired five episodes of this spin-off {{during the week}} of February 22, 2004, and an additional seven episodes later that year in May. As usual, contestants had to <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> series of 15 multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty, but the dollar values rose substantially. The first five questions for Super Millionaire were worth $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, $5,000 (the first safe haven), the remaining ten questions were worth $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $100,000 (the second safe haven), $500,000, $1,000,000, $2,500,000, $5,000,000, and $10,000,000.|$|E
5|$|The Maschinenpistole 40 ("Machine pistol 40") {{descended from}} its {{predecessor}} the MP 38, {{which was in}} turn based on the MP 36, a prototype made of machined steel. The MP 36 was developed independently by Erma Werke's Berthold Geipel with funding from the German Army. It took design elements from Heinrich Vollmer's VPM 1930 and EMP. Vollmer then worked on Berthold Geipel's MP 36 and in 1938 submitted a prototype to <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> request from the Heereswaffenamt (Army Weapons Office) for a new submachine gun, which was adopted as MP 38. The MP 38 was a simplification of the MP 36, and the MP 40 was a further simplification of the MP 38, with certain cost-saving alterations, most notably in the more extensive use of stamped steel rather than machined parts.|$|E

5000|$|Mokken scaling {{belongs to}} Item {{response}} theory. In essence, a Mokken scale is a non-parametric, probabilistic version of Guttman scale. Both Guttman and Mokken scaling {{can be used}} to assess whether a number of items measure the same underlying concept. Both Guttman and Mokken scaling are {{based on the assumption that}} the items are hierarchically ordered: this means that they are ordered by degree of [...] "difficulty". Difficulty here means the percentage of respondents that answers the question affirmatively. The hierarchical order means that <b>a</b> respondent who <b>answered</b> <b>a</b> difficult question correctly is assumed to <b>answer</b> <b>an</b> easy question correctly.The key difference between a Guttman and Mokken scale is that Mokken scaling is probabilistic in nature. The assumption is not that every respondent who <b>answered</b> <b>a</b> difficult question affirmatively will necessarily <b>answer</b> <b>an</b> easy question affirmatively. Violations of this are called Guttman errors. Instead, the assumption is that respondents who <b>answered</b> <b>a</b> difficult question affirmatively are more likely <b>answer</b> <b>an</b> easy question affirmatively. The scalability of the scale is measured by Loevinger's coefficient H. H compares the actual Guttman errors to the expected number of errors if the items would be unrelated.|$|R
5|$|The {{lighting}} system is programmed to darken the set as the contestant progresses {{further into the}} game. There are also spotlights situated {{at the bottom of}} the set area that zoom down on the contestant when they <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> major question; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such spotlights, oil is vaporized, creating a haze effect. Media scholar Dr. Robert Thompson, a professor at Syracuse University, stated that the show's {{lighting system}} made the contestant feel as though they were outside of prison when an escape was in progress.|$|E
5|$|Two {{years later}} Phips was {{appointed}} as governor. He had successfully straddled a middle political position, cultivating a strong {{connection to the}} powerful New England minister, Increase Mather, {{as well as his}} royalist opposition on the Board of Trade. Phips and Mather returned to the Massachusetts Bay Colony from England {{at the height of the}} witchcraft delusion, after numerous executions in Salem. Phips suspended the court proceedings, pardoned several people sentenced to death, and released more than 100 being held in jail before trial. He became enmeshed in related controversies that resulted in his recall to England to <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> variety of charges. Phips died in London at the age of 44 before the charges against him could be heard.|$|E
5|$|During the 1580s, Coke became intimately {{linked with}} the Howard family, the Dukes of Norfolk and Earls of Arundel. His uncle Thomas Gawdy had close links to Earl Arundel himself. In Norfolk Arundel held a liberty– he was {{essentially}} a local prince who appointed all officials, maintained his own prison, executed justice and bribed any royal clerks. His power base was his household, particularly the network of lawyers and stewards who held his estates together. Coke's uncle Thomas Gawdy had served as Steward to the Third Duke of Norfolk, and during the 1580s Coke was employed by the Howards to counter lawyers employed by the Crown, who argued that the Howards' lands were forfeit owing to the treason of the 4th Duke. As well as defeating these direct attacks Coke traveled to Cardiff to <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> challenge by Francis Dacre, son of William Dacre, 3rd Baron Dacre and uncle-in-law to the 4th Duke's three sons, Philip Howard and his two half-brothers, Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk and Lord William Howard– he proved that Dacre's evidence was false and had the case dismissed.|$|E

5|$|The {{first story}} is about the opening of Shiva's third eye when he visits Madurai, {{the capital city of}} the Pandya Kingdom, ruled at that time by Shenbagapandian. Shenbagapandian wants to find the answer to a {{question}} posed by his wife— whether the fragrance from a woman's hair is natural or artificial— and announces a reward of 1000gold coins to anyone who can come up with the <b>answer.</b> <b>A</b> poor poet named Dharumi desperately wants the reward and starts to break down in the Meenakshi Amman Temple. Shiva, hearing his cries, {{takes the form of a}} poet and gives Dharumi a poem containing the answer. Overjoyed, Dharumi takes the poem to Shenbagapandian's court and recites it, but Nakkeerar, the court's head poet, claims the poem's meaning is incorrect. On hearing this, Shiva argues with Nakkeerar about the poem's accuracy, burning him to ashes when he refuses to relent. Later, Shiva revives Nakkeerar, and says that he only wanted to test his knowledge. Nakkeerar asks the king to give the reward to Dharumi.|$|E
5|$|They {{finished}} 8–3 in 1941, {{and held}} a ceremony to honor the future Hall of Famer Leemans in the final regular season game on December 7, 1941. Leemans {{had been with the}} Giants since 1936, when he led the league in rushing as a rookie with 830yards. A versatile performer, he rushed for over 3,000yards, and passed for over 2,300 in his career. During the course of the game the stadium announcer paged Colonel William Joseph Donovan to <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> call from Washington, D.C., and told all servicemen to return to their units, but it was only when the game concluded that players and spectators learned of the attack on the naval base at Pearl Harbor earlier that day. New York advanced to the championship game following the season, in which they lost to the Bears 37–9. Both the 1940 and 1941 championship games were close early before their respective opponents went on an offensive surge to break the games open late. In 1942 and 1943, the Giants totalled an 11–8–2 record and failed to make the postseason.|$|E

25|$|Attribute {{substitution}} is {{a psychological}} process thought to underlie {{a number of}} cognitive biases and perceptual illusions. It occurs when an individual {{has to make a}} judgment (of a target attribute) that is computationally complex, and instead substitutes a more easily calculated heuristic attribute. This substitution is thought of as taking place in the automatic intuitive judgment system, rather than the more self-aware reflective system. Hence, when someone tries to <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> difficult question, they may actually <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> related but different question, without realizing that a substitution has taken place. This explains why individuals can be unaware of their own biases, and why biases persist even when the subject is made aware of them. It also explains why human judgments often fail to show regression toward the mean.|$|E
