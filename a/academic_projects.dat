40|$|AbstractThe article {{discusses}} {{application of}} the internal control means and key control factors in order to evaluate the economic security of <b>academic</b> research <b>projects.</b> Definition of the <b>academic</b> research <b>project</b> economic security is discussed. An integral indicator of the <b>academic</b> research <b>project</b> economic security is suggested. Credibility, probability, compliance, efficiency and competitiveness are suggested as primary indicators of the <b>academic</b> research <b>project</b> internal control evaluation. A system of the key control factors of the <b>academic</b> research <b>project</b> is proposed. Principles for the calculation of the threshold ranges of the <b>academic</b> research <b>project</b> economic security are discussed. A scheme of the <b>academic</b> research <b>project</b> economic security identification process is suggested...|$|R

There {{have been many}} reforms in higher education of the country. The University has made great efforts since then to improve the internal structure {{and has become a}} signatory of the Bologna declaration. Being one of Europe’s largest universities with an enrollment of nearly 90,000 students, the University broadly cooperates with international academic institutions and is involved in countless bilateral and multilateral <b>academic</b> <b>projects.</b>|$|E
25|$|Albert Einstein {{was widely}} known during his {{lifetime}} for his work with the theory of relativity and physics in general. His political opinions were of public interest {{through the middle of}} the 20th century due to his fame and involvement in political, humanitarian and <b>academic</b> <b>projects</b> around the world. He was often called upon to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics. Einstein's visible position in society allowed him to speak and write frankly, even provocatively, {{at a time when many}} people were silenced due to the rise of the Nazi movement.|$|E
25|$|The {{college has}} good {{relations}} with many manufacturing industries in and around Pune including Bajaj Group, Tata Motors, Thermax, FIAT India and Kirloskar Oil Engines Limited, where students participate in various <b>academic</b> <b>projects.</b> The presence of several research laboratories including the Meteorological Survey of India, National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), National Centre for Radio Astronomy (NCRA), Inter-University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Defence Research Development Organization (DRDO) and Center for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC) provide students with access to R & D facilities. In addition, the city {{is home to the}} growing software and hardware industry (mainly in Hinjawadi Infotech Park), thus enabling more students to pursue final-year projects in these industries.|$|E

25|$|Since 2000, {{scholarly}} {{research has}} focused on aspects of Ruskin's legacy, including his impact on the sciences; John Lubbock and Oliver Lodge admired him. Two major <b>academic</b> <b>projects</b> have looked at Ruskin and cultural tourism (investigating, for example, Ruskin's links with Thomas Cook); the other focuses on Ruskin and the theatre. The sociologist and media theorist, David Gauntlett, argues that Ruskin's notions of craft can be traced to today's online community at YouTube and throughout Web 2.0. Similarly, architectural theorist Lars Spuybroek has argued that Ruskin's understanding of the Gothic as a combination of two types of variation, rough savageness and smooth changefulness, opens up a whole new way of thinking leading to digital and so-called parametric design.|$|E
25|$|Public {{systems or}} those {{crossing}} administrative domains (including different {{departments in the}} same organization) often result in the need to run on heterogeneous systems, using different operating systems and hardware architectures. With many languages, there is a trade-off between investment in software development {{and the number of}} platforms that can be supported (and thus the size of the resulting network). Cross-platform languages can reduce the need to make this tradeoff, though potentially at the expense of high performance on any given node (due to run-time interpretation or lack of optimization for the particular platform). There are diverse scientific and commercial projects to harness a particularly associated grid or for the purpose of setting up new grids. BOINC is a common one for various <b>academic</b> <b>projects</b> seeking public volunteers; more are listed {{at the end of the}} article.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the factors associated with undergraduate students’ behaviour in seeking information for their <b>academic</b> <b>project.</b> Data was collected using a questionnaire administered to 199 final year undergraduate students, purposively selected from three colleges in one Malaysian public university. For the purpose of data analysis, the respondents were grouped into technology and non-technology students based on their programmes of study. The findings of the study suggest that information skills among technological and non-technological students are quite different. This may be due to the nature of the <b>academic</b> <b>project</b> that requires the latter to use different information skills in seeking <b>academic</b> <b>project</b> information. It is anticipated that the findings of this study would result in further research on the information skills specifically focusing on the technological students. The result of the study can be used as initial guidelines for lecturers and librarians to develop related training programmes for new undergraduates...|$|R
