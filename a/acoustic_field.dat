2500|$|Lighthill rearranged the Navier–Stokes equations, which {{govern the}} flow of a {{compressible}} viscous fluid, into an inhomogeneous wave equation, thereby making a connection between fluid mechanics and acoustics. This is often called [...] "Lighthill's analogy" [...] because it presents {{a model for the}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>field</b> that is not, strictly speaking, based on the physics of flow-induced/generated noise, but rather on the analogy of how they might be represented through the governing equations of a compressible fluid.|$|E
50|$|A {{parallel}} beam {{is described as}} a group of straight and parallel 'rays'.The rays cross through the transparent medium while potentially interacting with the contained <b>acoustic</b> <b>field,</b> and finally reach the focusing element.Note that the principle of a focusing element is directing (i.e. focusing) rays that are parallel - into a single point on the focal plane of the element. Thus, the population of rays crossing the focal plane of the focusing element can be divided into two groups: those that interacted with the <b>acoustic</b> <b>field</b> and those that didn't. The latter group is undisturbed by the <b>acoustic</b> <b>field,</b> so it remains parallel and forms a point in a well-defined position in the focal plane. The optical stop is positioned exactly at that point, so as to prevent all corresponding rays from further propagating through the system and to the camera.Thus we get rid of the portion of light that crossed the <b>acoustic</b> <b>field</b> without interaction.However, there are also rays that did interact with the <b>acoustic</b> <b>field</b> in the following manner:If a ray travels through a region of nonuniform density whose spatial gradient has a component orthogonal to the ray, that ray is deflected from its original orientation, as if it were passing through a prism. This ray is no longer parallel, so it doesn't intersect {{the focal point of the}} focusing element and is not blocked by the knife. In some circumstances the deflected ray escapes the knife-blade and reaches the camera to create a point-like image on the camera-sensor, with a position and intensity related to the inhomogeneity experienced by the ray. An image is formed in this way, exclusively by rays that interacted with the <b>acoustic</b> <b>field,</b> providing a mapping of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E

50|$|Non-inertial {{cavitation}} is {{the process}} in which small bubbles in a liquid are forced to oscillate {{in the presence of}} an <b>acoustic</b> <b>field,</b> when the intensity of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>field</b> is insufficient to cause total bubble collapse.

40|$|In this paper, {{we apply}} a block-based {{compressive}} sensing (BCS) architecture {{to address the}} reconstruction of underwater <b>acoustic</b> intensity <b>fields.</b> Although with anisotropic characteristics, underwater <b>acoustic</b> intensity <b>fields</b> can be compressed or represented in sparse transform domains. The distinct advantages of the BCS method include no need for any prior knowledge of the interested <b>acoustic</b> <b>fields</b> and no need for complete sampling coverage. Both benefits can facilitate experimentation and improve reconstruction precision. We demonstrated the recovery capability by applying this algorithm to the reconstruction of simulated <b>acoustic</b> <b>fields</b> in the Gulf of Mexico, where the bathymetry and water column showed high levels of spatial variability. Further, a field experiment was conducted at a local river, Lake Tamaha, where an autonomous underwater vehicle navigated during acoustic transmissions.

40|$|A {{coherent}} phase-contrast {{optical system}} has been designed and tested for tomographic imaging of pressure fields from experimental transient acoustic signals.

Simulations of the system are performed using a single-cycle sine-wave acoustic pulse. Experimental images resulting from a broad-band Gaussian pulse input to an underwater piezoceramic transducer array are presented. Relative pressure field s are reconstructed in space over a series of times after the source excitation. Theory and limitations of the phase contrast system are discussed.

50|$|Inertial {{cavitation}} {{can also}} {{occur in the}} presence of an <b>acoustic</b> <b>field.</b> Microscopic gas bubbles that are generally present in a liquid will be forced to oscillate due to an applied <b>acoustic</b> <b>field.</b> If the acoustic intensity is sufficiently high, the bubbles will first grow in size and then rapidly collapse. Hence, inertial cavitation can occur even if the rarefaction in the liquid is insufficient for a Rayleigh-like void to occur. High-power ultrasonics usually utilize the inertial cavitation of microscopic vacuum bubbles for treatment of surfaces, liquids, and slurries.|$|E
