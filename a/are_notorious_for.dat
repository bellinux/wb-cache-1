5|$|A carnivore, the caracal {{typically}} preys upon small mammals, {{birds and}} rodents. Studies in South Africa {{have reported that}} it preys on the Cape grysbok, the common duiker, sheep, goats, bush vlei rats, rock hyraxes, hare and birds. A study in western India showed that rodents comprise {{a significant portion of}} the diet. They will feed from a variety of sources, but tend to focus on the most abundant one. Grasses and grapes are taken occasionally to clear their immune system and stomach of any parasites. Larger antelopes such as young kudu, bushbuck, impala, mountain reedbuck and springbok may also be targeted. Mammals generally comprise at least 80 percent of the diet. Lizards, snakes and insects are infrequently eaten. They <b>are</b> <b>notorious</b> <b>for</b> attacking livestock, but rarely attack humans.|$|E

25|$|The first climbs of {{the race}} are usually located in the {{periphery}} of West-Flanders, after 70–80km of racing. After ca. 100km the course passes {{for the first time}} through Oudenaarde, after which the race remains in the Flemish Ardennes, in the southern half of East-Flanders, with a succession of hills (hellingen) and a few flat sections of cobbled roads which determine the nature {{of the race}}. The hills offer many opportunities to attack and are usually the decisive sites of the race. These climbs <b>are</b> <b>notorious</b> <b>for</b> being short but very steep, and most of them - but not all - are cobbled.|$|E
25|$|Located at 42° South, the City of Clarence has a mild {{temperate}} {{maritime climate}} (Group C:Cfb, {{according to the}} Köppen climate classification) with an average summer temperature of 21°C. On average, Clarence is warmer, and has less annual precipitation than Hobart or Glenorchy. The southern regions of the city <b>are</b> <b>notorious</b> <b>for</b> being affected by strong southerly winds known locally as the 'sea breeze', particularly during summer months. The City of Clarence generally receives sunrise two to three minutes before Hobart and Glenorchy, and sunset is also experienced slightly after the western shore, due to the angle of shadow cast by Mount Wellington.|$|E

25|$|Cities {{generate}} considerable ecological footprints, {{locally and}} at longer distances, due to concentrated populations and technological activities. From one perspective, cities are not ecologically sustainable {{due to their}} resource needs. From another, proper management {{may be able to}} ameliorate a city's ill effects. Air pollution arises from various forms of combustion, including fireplaces, wood or coal-burning stoves, other heating systems, and internal combustion engines. Industrialized cities, and today third-world megacities, <b>are</b> <b>notorious</b> <b>for</b> veils of smog (industrial haze) which envelop them, posing a chronic threat to the health of their millions of inhabitants. Urban soil contains higher concentrations of heavy metals (especially lead, copper, and nickel) and has lower pH than soil in comparable wilderness.|$|E
25|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of the strip club industry observed in the 2000s occurred primarily in the Western world. Far from its heyday in the 1980s and 1990s, Japan's sex industry {{has been in a}} protracted slump {{in the first decade of}} the 21st century, as the overall economy experienced a recession. Its hostess and strip bars (those which had not closed outright) felt the impact of dwindling corporate spending accounts, leading to increased competition (and reduced boundaries) for remaining patrons. Profitability of strip clubs, as with other service-oriented businesses, is largely driven by location and customer spending habits. Clubs closely proximate to Wall Street in New York, New York <b>are</b> <b>notorious</b> <b>for</b> hosting meetings with financial industry power brokers, among other business heavyweights, which are frequently expensed on company bankrolls. Since clubs located in urban areas or business centers have caused concerns over traffic and social issues, some club owners with common interests in close proximity have shared representation without consolidating their businesses. After numerous incidents during the 1990s with local and state government, Downtown Entertainment Inc. was formed in 2000 to represent the interests of business owners on The Block in Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E
500|$|Pilot whales eat squid primarily, {{and also}} fish. They are highly social, and {{studies suggest that}} {{both males and females}} remain in their mother's pod, an unusual trait among mammals, also found in certain killer whale communities. Short-finned pilot whales {{are one of the few}} mammal species in which females go through menopause, and post-reproductive females may {{contribute}} to the survival of younger members of their pods. Pilot whales <b>are</b> <b>notorious</b> <b>for</b> stranding themselves on beaches, and are among the most common cetacean stranders. Several theories have been proposed to account for this behavior. The conservation status of neither species has been determined, but they are subject to both direct and indirect bycatch in fisheries. [...] Whalers in a few countries continue to hunt pilot whales.|$|E

500|$|Grindcore {{lyrics are}} {{typically}} provocative. A number of grindcore musicians {{are committed to}} political and ethical causes, generally leaning towards the far left in connection to grindcore's punk roots. For example, Napalm Death's songs address a variety of anarchist concerns, {{in the tradition of}} anarcho-punk. These themes include anti-racism, feminism, anti-militarism, and anti-capitalism. Other grindcore groups, such as Cattle Decapitation and Carcass, have expressed disgust with human behavior, animal abuse, and are, in some cases, vegetarians or vegans. Carcass' work in particular is often identified as the origin of the goregrind style, which is devoted to [...] "bodily" [...] themes. Groups that shift their bodily focus to sexual matters, such as Gut and the Meat Shits, are sometimes referred to as pornogrind. Seth Putnam's lyrics <b>are</b> <b>notorious</b> <b>for</b> their black comedy, while The Locust tend toward satirical collage, indebted to William S. Burroughs' cut-up method.|$|E
500|$|Trujillo's {{regime is}} {{supported}} by Johnny Abbes García, {{the head of the}} Military Intelligence Service (SIM), a brutal man to whom many [...] "disappearances, ... executions, ... sudden falls into disgrace" [...] are attributed. [...] Abbes and his intelligence officers <b>are</b> <b>notorious</b> <b>for</b> their cruelty, particularly their habit of killing dissidents by throwing them into shark-infested waters. Colonel Abbes [...] "may be the devil, but he's useful to the Chief; everything bad is attributed to him and only the good to Trujillo". Trujillo's son, Ramfis Trujillo, is a loyal supporter of the Chief. [...] After unsuccessful attempts at schooling in the United States, Ramfis returns to the Dominican Republic to serve in his father's military. [...] He is a well-known womanizer. [...] Upon Trujillo's death, Ramfis seeks revenge, even {{going so far as to}} torture and kill his uncle by marriage, General Jose Roman, for his part in the assassination conspiracy.|$|E
