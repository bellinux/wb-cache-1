5000|$|<b>Aerography</b> is a surrealist {{method in}} which a stencil used in spraypainting is {{replaced}} by a three-dimensional object, sometimes in extreme cases male artists have used their genitals as stencils. The <b>aerography</b> technique is most recognizable as a blended and photorealistic style. The method has been used to decorate tiles from the Victorian era and in the works of Man Ray.|$|E

The naval aviation training program at MIT was expanded to include an <b>aerography</b> school training 54 weather forecasters, and an inspector's school training 114 airplane inspectors and 58 engine inspectors to oversee quality control of newly manufactured aviation material.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aerography</b> is the {{production}} of weather charts. The information is supplied by radiosonde observations, principally. Constant-pressure charts are routinely constructed at standard air pressures. Standard air pressures are 850, 700, 500, 400, 300, 250, and 200 millibars (hectopascals) (hPa) (SI). Weather charts are sometimes drawn at lower air pressures that occur above 40,000 feet (12 km). The lines of equal air pressure are called isobars. Isotherms are the lines of equal air temperature.|$|E
50|$|Stencil {{technique}} in visual art is {{also referred to}} as pochoir. A related technique (which has found applicability in some surrealist compositions) is <b>aerography,</b> in which spray-painting is done around a three-dimensional object to create a negative of the object instead of a positive of a stencil design. This technique was used in cave paintings dating to 10,000 BC, where human hands were used in painting hand print outlines among paintings of animals and other objects. The artist sprayed pigment around his hand by using a hollow bone, blown by mouth to direct a stream of pigment.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} model, {{which is called}} ‘ 3 D (Three Dimension) local {{non-uniform}} field model based on 3 D vector model frame’, which integrate ‘ 3 D volume function analytical model ’ and ‘ 3 D local raster model’into the frame of ‘ 3 D vector boundary model’, to express 3 D object and local non-uniform attribute data field. In the model, the authors adopt 3 D vector boundary model as basic frame, then partition solid objects interested by user and construct volume function, i. e. represent local non-uniformity attribute data field inside the solid objects by ‘ 3 D volume function analytic model’. 3 D volume function analytic model could be visualized by ‘slice up ’ method, or be translated into 3 D local raster data model for visualization. In this way, it can integrate vector representation, analytic expression, and raster representation into a unified 3 D model. The paper proposes that there two topological view in GIS, one topological view is based on boundary and coboundary, another topological view is based on point-set theory. In dealing with surface feature or boundary surface of solid feature, the author advise using ‘ 3 D TIN partition along surface’and‘double cubic B-B(Bernstein-Bézier) triangle surface piece smooth connection’, which are widely used in 3 D CAD and 3 D geometry modeling. With the help of these techniques, it can deal with nearly vertical surface, and make surface representation more approximate to natural surface than ‘plane TIN partition ’ and ‘small triangle plane ’ in traditional geo-science. This 3 D data model {{could be used in}} geology, mining, environment, oceanography and <b>aerography.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliography. This study {{aimed to}} {{describe}} patterns of distribution in terrestrial Afrotropical birds, {{to investigate the}} causes of these patterns, and examine how aspects of distributional patterns {{may be used to}} prioritize local regions for conservation attention. Presence-only data were gathered and digitized at one-degree square scale for 1686 terrestrial bird species that breed on or regularly visit sub-Saharan Africa as non-breeding migrants. Biogeographical analysis of the 1437 species that are globally restricted to sub-Saharan Africa (Afrotropical endemics) revealed a suite of geographical areas that have a homogenous and characteristic avifaunal composition, termed avifaunal zones. The approach used in this study ensured representativeness in the resultant biogeographical classification scheme, which was not biased towards avifaunas that are species rich or that contain many narrow endemics, and further included avifaunas that consisted of few, but taxonomically and ecologically distinct species (e. g. the Namib Province). Analysis of zonal boundaries exhibiting high levels of turnover, defined specifically as species replacement, were distinguished from zonal boundaries that are characterised by species richness gradients. For instance, the northern forest-savanna boundary between the Guineo-Congolian and Northern Savanna Subregions was shown to consist of a sharp ecotone between forest and savanna, whereas the boundary between the Northern Savanna and Northern Arid Subregions was shown to be dominated by species drop-outs. This shows that whereas the Northern Savanna Subregion represents a unique avifauna that is distinct from that of the Guineo-Congolian Subregion, the Northern Arid Subregion is merely a depauparate subset of the Northern Savanna avifauna. Patterns of species richness and narrow endemism where shown to differ between species groups that exhibit different life history characteristics (e. g. residents vs. migrants) and distributional characteristics Atrotropical endemics vs. nonendemics). Differences can probably be attributed to island biogeography and <b>aerography</b> theory...|$|E
