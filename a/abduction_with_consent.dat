40|$|AbstractCurrently Kazakhs marry through betrothal and by {{kidnapping}} the bride. Kazakhs abduct {{the girl}} <b>with</b> her <b>consent,</b> and often <b>with</b> the <b>consent</b> of her parents. Abductions {{without the consent}} was the infringe the common law in the past, but today recognized national consciousness as a national tradition. The paper considers the temporal dynamics and causes distribution of the Kazakh bride kidnapping. It was apparent that fictitious kidnapping (<b>abduction</b> <b>with</b> the <b>consent</b> of the girl), and a real steal (abduction {{without the consent of}} the girl) - they are two fundamentally different things, and in the modern Kazakh life exist those two kind of abductions...|$|R

40|$|Abduction, first {{proposed}} {{in the setting of}} classical logics, has been studied with growing interest in the logic programming area during the last years. In this paper we study <b>abduction</b> <b>with</b> penalization in the logic programming framework. This form of abductive reasoning, which has not been previously analyzed in logic programming, turns out to represent several relevant problems, including optimization problems, very naturally. We define a formal model for <b>abduction</b> <b>with</b> penalization over logic programs, which extends the abductive framework proposed by Kakas and Mancarella. We address knowledge representation issues, encoding a number of problems in our abductive framework. In particular, we consider some relevant problems, taken from different domains, ranging from optimization theory to diagnosis and planning; their encodings turn out to be simple and elegant in our formalism. We thoroughly analyze the computational complexity of the main problems arising in the context of <b>abduction</b> <b>with</b> penalization from logic programs. Finally, we implement a system supporting the proposed abductive framework on top of the DLV engine. To this end, we design a translation from <b>abduction</b> problems <b>with</b> penalties into logic programs with weak constraints. We prove that this approach is sound and complete.

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] This study {{investigated}} the selective activation of the gluteus maximus during a prone hip extension with knee flexion exercise, with the hip joint in different positions. [Subjects] The subjects were 21 healthy, male volunteers. [Methods] Activities of the right gluteus maximus, right hamstrings, bilateral lumbar erector spinae, and bilateral lumbar multifidus were measured using surface electromyography during a prone hip extension with knee flexion exercise. Measurements were made with the hip joint in each of 3 positions: (1) a neutral hip joint position, (2) an abduction hip joint position, and (3) an <b>abduction</b> <b>with</b> external rotation hip joint position. [Results] Gluteus maximus activity was significantly higher when the hip was in the <b>abduction</b> <b>with</b> external rota-tion hip joint position than when {{it was in the}} neutral hip joint and abduction hip joint positions. Gluteus maximus activity was also significantly higher in the abduction hip joint position than in the neutral hip joint position. Ham-string activity was significantly lower when the hip was in the <b>abduction</b> <b>with</b> external rotation hip joint position than when it was in the neutral hip joint and abduction hip joint positions. [Conclusion] Abduction and external rotation of the hip during prone hip extension with knee flexion exercise selectively activates the gluteus maximus...|$|R

40|$|The rule-nding {{abduction}} is an <b>abduction</b> {{which begins}} <b>with</b> {{the observation of}} a surprising fact, nds a rule in the set of programs, and proposes a hypothesis. This pa-per investigates such rule-nding abduction for logic programming from two viewpoints: termination and analogical reasoning. In order to discuss the termination of rule-nding abduction, we introduce two concepts of loop-pair and loop-elimination. We show that the loop-pair is a syntactical condition {{to determine whether the}} process of rule-nding abduction is innite. Also we show that, by using loop-elimination, we can delete all the innite processes of rule-nding abduction. On the other hand, we discuss the rela-tionship between analogical reasoning and rule-nding abduction. Then, we formulate rule- nding <b>abduction</b> <b>with</b> analogy, and dene a deducible hypothesis. We show that a deducible hypothesis is correct in the sense of analogical reasoning. Also we show that, if a target program is empty, then a deducible hypothesis is polynomial time computable on the length of a surprising fact and the size of a proof tree. Furthermore, we realize rule- nding <b>abduction</b> <b>with</b> analogy by a Prolog program. ...|$|R
