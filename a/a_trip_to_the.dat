5|$|Due to prior agreement, the 2007 {{edition of}} the Border War was held in Kansas City, Missouri, at Arrowhead Stadium, home of the National Football League's Kansas City Chiefs. In front of over 80,000fans, No.4 Missouri {{defeated}} No.2 Kansas 3628 to hand the Jayhawks their first loss of the season.

5|$|In 1903, the English {{composer}} Ezra Read {{published a}} piano piece called <b>A</b> <b>Trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Moon: Comic Descriptive Fantasia, which follows Méliès's film scene by scene {{and may have}} been used as a score for the film; it may have been commissioned by Méliès himself, who had likely met Read on one of his trips to England. More recent composers who have recorded scores for <b>A</b> <b>Trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Moon include Nicolas Godin and Jean-Benoit Dunckel of Air (for the 2011 restoration; see the Hand-colored version section below), Frederick Hodges, Robert Israel, Eric Le Guen, Lawrence Lehérissey (a great-great-grandson of Méliès), Donald Sosin, and Victor Young (for an abridged print featured as a prologue to the 1956 film Around the World in 80 Days).|$|E

5|$|Méliès, who {{had begun}} <b>A</b> <b>Trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Moon in May 1902, {{finished}} {{the film in}} August of that year and began selling prints to French distributors in the same month. From September through December 1902, a hand-colored print of <b>A</b> <b>Trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Moon was screened at Méliès's Théâtre Robert-Houdin in Paris. The film was shown after Saturday and Thursday matinee performances by Méliès's colleague and fellow magician, Jules-Eugène Legris, who appeared {{as the leader of}} the parade in the two final scenes. Méliès sold black-and-white and color prints of the film through his Star Film Company, where the film was assigned the catalogue number 399–411 and given the descriptive subtitle Pièce à grand spectacle en 30 tableaux. In France, black-and-white prints sold for 560, and hand-colored prints for 1,000. Méliès also sold the film indirectly through Charles Urban's Warwick Trading Company in London.|$|E

5|$|A {{more ambitious}} plan by Butlin was thought up on <b>a</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bahamas in 1946. Seeing {{potential}} for a camp in warmer climes, he formed a company under the chairmanship of Sir Bede Edmund Hugh Clifford and bought land in Grand Bahama. Butlin also purchased the Princess hotel in Bermuda and the Fort Montagu beach hotel in Nassau. The camp {{was intended to be}} complete and open on New Years Day of 1950. After an investment of US$5 million (2011:£) the camp opened, still only partially complete, in the winter of 1949. To celebrate its opening, Butlin ran a mystery flight, where guests, who had paid $129 (2011:£) each, were taken on a flight to the resort without being informed in advance.|$|E
5|$|According to Méliès's recollections, much of {{the unusual}} cost of <b>A</b> <b>Trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Moon {{was due to the}} {{mechanically}} operated scenery and the Selenite costumes in particular, which were made for the film using cardboard and canvas. Méliès himself sculpted prototypes for the heads, feet, and kneecap pieces in terra cotta, and then created plaster molds for them. A specialist in mask-making used these molds to produce cardboard versions for the actors to wear. One of the backdrops for the film, showing the inside of the glass-roofed workshop in which the space capsule is built, was painted to look like the actual glass-roofed studio in which the film was made.|$|E
