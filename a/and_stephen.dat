5|$|In 1353, John and {{his family}} were granted Venetian citizenship, which hints that his domain was under the {{protection}} of Venice. The premature death of Stephen Dušan in 1355 plunged the Serbian Empire into civil war. In that conflict, John took the side of his wife's son-in-law Simeon Uroš against the legitimate successor Stephen Uroš, who was Stephen Dušan's son and Simeon Uroš's nephew. While Simeon's attempt at taking the throne was ill-fated <b>and</b> <b>Stephen</b> Uroš even captured Berat in 1356, John managed to preserve his remaining lands and became independent from both Simeon <b>and</b> <b>Stephen</b> Uroš. The threat of Nikephoros II Orsini, who was gaining ground in Thessaly and Epirus, forced John to request the dispatch of a Venetian warship and an administrator from Venice to take control of his domain, to which the republic obliged.|$|E
