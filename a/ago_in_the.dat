5|$|The Crocodilia (or Crocodylia) is {{an order}} of mostly large, predatory, semiaquatic reptiles, known as crocodilians. They first {{appeared}} 83.5 million years <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Late Cretaceous period (Campanian stage) and are the closest living relatives of birds, as the two groups are the only known survivors of the Archosauria. Members of the order's total group, the clade Pseudosuchia, appeared about 250 million years <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Early Triassic period, and diversified during the Mesozoic era. The order Crocodilia includes the true crocodiles (family Crocodylidae), the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), and the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae). Although the term 'crocodiles' is sometimes {{used to refer to}} all of these, crocodilians is a less ambiguous vernacular term for members of this group.|$|E
5|$|All {{the cats}} in this genus {{share a common}} {{ancestor}} that {{is believed to have}} lived around 6–7million years <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Near East (the Middle East). The exact relationships within the Felidae are close but still uncertain, e.g. the Chinese mountain cat is sometimes classified (under the name Felis silvestris bieti) as a subspecies of the wildcat, like the North African variety F. s. lybica.|$|E
5|$|Between 15 and 16million years <b>ago,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle Miocene, eruptions of Columbia River basalts from {{volcanic}} vents {{in eastern}} Oregon and Washington flowed {{across much of}} northern Oregon, sometimes reaching the Pacific Ocean. Although these basalts have been mapped in the West Hills under Marquam Hill, Hoyt Arboretum, and the steepest slopes of Forest Park, they flowed around but did not completely cover the Waverly Hills Formation in the Tryon Creek watershed.|$|E

5|$|Dopamine {{is used as}} a {{neurotransmitter}} in most multicellular animals. In sponges {{there is}} only a single report of the presence of dopamine, with no indication of its function; however, dopamine has been reported in the nervous systems of many other radially symmetric species, including the cnidarian jellyfish, hydra and some corals. This dates the emergence of dopamine as a neurotransmitter back to the earliest appearance of the nervous system, over 500 million years <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cambrian era. Dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter in vertebrates, echinoderms, arthropods, molluscs, and several types of worm.|$|E
5|$|Hadrocodium, whose fossils {{date from}} {{approximately}} 195 million years <b>ago,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early Jurassic, provides the first {{clear evidence of}} a jaw joint formed solely by the squamosal and dentary bones; there is no space in the jaw for the articular, a bone involved in the jaws of all early synapsids.|$|E
5|$|Starting 20 {{million years}} <b>ago</b> (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cenozoic) and lasting until 5 million years ago, a now-extinct {{extension}} of Cascade Range volcanoes erupted, bringing {{large amounts of}} igneous material in the area. These igneous deposits blanketed the region north of the Yosemite region. Volcanic activity persisted past 5 million years BP east of the current park borders in the Mono Lake and Long Valley areas.|$|E
50|$|Fifty years <b>ago,</b> <b>in</b> 1965, <b>the</b> first Danish design award, the ID Prize was launched. This was {{followed}} by <b>the</b> IG Prize <b>in</b> 1980, which merged, into the Danish Design Award in 2000.|$|R
5|$|With the {{exception}} of Greece and Italy, historical volcanism has not taken place <b>in</b> Continental Europe. <b>The</b> most recent volcanic activity occurred between 40,000 and 6,500 years <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> Garrotxa, <b>the</b> Massif Central and the Vulkaneifel.|$|R
50|$|First Baptist Church is an Evangelical Protestant church {{located in}} Ukiah, California. First Baptist {{is part of}} the American Baptist denomination. Founded nearly 150 years <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> 1859, <b>the</b> church has had three major {{upgrades}} of their facilities.|$|R
5|$|The Bovidae are the {{biological}} family of cloven-hoofed, ruminant mammals that includes bison, African buffalo, water buffalo, antelopes, sheep, goats, muskoxen, and domestic cattle. A {{member of this}} family is called a bovid. With 143 extant species and 300 known extinct species, the family Bovidae consists of eight major subfamilies apart from the disputed Peleinae and Pantholopinae. The family evolved 20 million years <b>ago,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early Miocene.|$|E
5|$|The {{dromedary}} has {{not occurred}} naturally {{in the wild}} for nearly 2,000 years. It was probably first domesticated in Somalia or the Arabian Peninsula about 4,000 years <b>ago.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> wild, the dromedary inhabited arid regions, including the Sahara Desert. The domesticated dromedary is generally found in the semi-arid to arid regions of the Old World, mainly in Africa, and a significant feral population occurs in Australia. Products of the dromedary, including its meat and milk, support several north Arabian tribes; it is also commonly used for riding and as a beast of burden.|$|E
5|$|The {{floodplain}} of Johnson Creek is {{a remnant}} of large glacial floods known as the Missoula Floods that deposited thick sediments between 18,000 and 13,000years <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Columbia River Basin, including much of the Willamette Valley. Underlying the sediments are substantial thicknesses of basalt lavas from the Columbia River Basalt Group. The lava, exposed mainly in the uplands, has been folded and faulted to form a series of sub-basins, including the Johnson Creek watershed.|$|E

5|$|The genus {{appeared}} {{some time}} in the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene eras, around 24 million years <b>ago,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Iberian peninsula. While the exact origin of the word Narcissus is unknown it is frequently linked to its fragrance which was thought to be narcotic, and to the legend of the youth of that name who fell in love with his reflection. In the English language the common name Daffodil appears to be derived from the Asphodel with which it was commonly compared.|$|E
5|$|The remarkably {{successful}} Hymenoptera {{appeared as}} long as 146 million years <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cretaceous period, but achieved their wide diversity more recently in the Cenozoic era, which began 66 million years ago. A number of highly successful insect groups evolved in conjunction with flowering plants, a powerful illustration of coevolution.|$|E
5|$|The waterfalls are on {{the section}} of Kitchen Creek that flows down the Allegheny Front, a steep {{escarpment}} between the Allegheny Plateau {{to the north and}} the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians to the south. The glens are made of sedimentary rocks from the Huntley Mountain and Catskill Formations that formed up to 370million years <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Devonian and Carboniferous periods. The waterfalls are the result of increased flow in Kitchen Creek from glaciers enlarging its drainage basin during the last Ice Age.|$|E
25|$|The Barnett Shale is a {{geological}} formation located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bend Arch-Fort Worth Basin.

5|$|This {{species of}} {{wildebeest}} {{seems to have}} evolved around 2.5 million years ago. The black wildebeest {{is believed to have}} diverged from the blue wildebeest to become a distinct species around a million years <b>ago,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid to late Pleistocene. Fossil evidence suggests that the blue wildebeest were quite common in the Cradle of Humankind in the past. Apart from eastern Africa, fossils are commonly found in Elandsfontein, Cornelia and Florisbad.|$|E
5|$|A 2015 genetic {{study by}} {{evolutionary}} biologist Emma Harrower and colleagues of C.violaceus and its closest relatives {{suggests that the}} group (section Cortinarius) originated in Australasia and began diverging from a common ancestor around 12 million years <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Miocene, with C.violaceus itself diverging from its closest relative around 3.9 million years ago. The fact that these species diverged relatively recently indicates {{that some form of}} dispersal must have taken place across large bodies of water. The original plant hosts were flowering plants (angiosperms), and C.violaceus—or its direct ancestor—developed a symbiotic relationship with pines, as well as multiple flowering plants; this may have facilitated its expansion across the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with most}} of the Pleistocene megafauna, Smilodon became extinct 10,000 years <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Quaternary {{extinction}} event. Its extinction has been linked to the decline and extinction of large herbivores, which were replaced by smaller and more agile ones like deer. Hence, Smilodon could have been too specialized at hunting large prey and may have been unable to adapt. A 2012 study of Smilodon tooth wear found no evidence that they were limited by food resources. Other explanations include climate change and competition with humans (who entered the Americas around the time Smilodon disappeared), or a combination of several factors, all of which apply to the general Pleistocene extinction event, rather than specifically to the extinction of the saber-toothed cats.|$|E
50|$|Chilesaurus is an extinct genus of herbivorous dinosaur. The {{type and}} only species is Chilesaurus diegosuarezi. Chilesaurus lived about 145 million years <b>ago</b> (Mya) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Late Jurassic period of Chile.|$|R

30|$|The {{need for}} a {{reliable}} and as complete as possible dataset for the past (pre-instrumental period) {{led to the development}} of, as mentioned before, a new research branch, approximately forty years <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> Europe, <b>the</b> “Historical Seismology,” which is most important <b>in</b> countries where <b>the</b> seismicity is low.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the rock}} {{formations}} exposed in Colton Point State Park and the Pine Creek Gorge {{are at least}} 300million years old, the gorge itself formed about 20,000years <b>ago,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last ice age. Pine Creek had flowed northeasterly until then, but was dammed by rocks, soil, ice, and other debris deposited by the receding Laurentide Continental Glacier. The dammed creek formed a lake near what would later be the village of Ansonia, and the lake's glacial meltwater overflowed the debris dam, reversing the flow of Pine Creek. The creek flooded {{to the south and}} quickly carved a deep channel {{on its way to the}} West Branch Susquehanna River.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the rock}} {{formations}} exposed in Upper Pine Bottom State Park and the Pine Creek Gorge {{are at least}} 300million years old, the gorge itself formed about 20,000years <b>ago,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last ice age. Pine Creek had flowed northeasterly until then, but was dammed by rocks, soil, ice, and other debris deposited by the receding Laurentide Continental Glacier. The dammed creek formed a lake near what would later be the village of Ansonia in Shippen Township in Tioga County, and the lake's glacial meltwater overflowed the debris dam, reversing the flow of Pine Creek.

5|$|Arsenal were {{appearing}} in {{the final of the}} FA Cup for the fifteenth time, and for the second consecutive year. They had won the cup seven times previously (in 1930, 1936, 1950, 1971, 1979, 1993 and 1998) and were beaten in the final seven times, the most recent in last season's showpiece event. By comparison, Chelsea were making their seventh appearance in a FA Cup final. The club won the cup three times (1970, 1997 and 2000) and lost the same number of finals (1915, 1967 and 1994). Arsenal and Chelsea had previously met fourteen times in the FA Cup, including four replays. Arsenal had a slender advantage in those meetings, winning five times to Chelsea's four, and defeated their London rivals a season <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fifth round of the competition.|$|E
