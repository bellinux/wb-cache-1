6000|$|Ah! how delicious {{it is to}} {{turn over}} {{and go to sleep}} again: [...] "just for five minutes." [...] Is there any human being, I wonder, besides the hero of a Sunday-school [...] "tale for boys," [...] who ever gets up willingly? There are some men to whom getting up at the proper time is an utter impossibility. If eight o'clock happens to be the time that they should turn out, then they lie till half-past. If {{circumstances}} change and half-past eight becomes early enough for them, then it is nine before they can rise. They are like the statesman of whom it was said that he was always punctually half an hour late. They try all manner of schemes. They buy <b>alarm-clocks</b> (artful contrivances that go off at the wrong time and alarm the wrong people). They tell Sarah Jane to knock at the door and call them, and Sarah Jane does knock at the door and does call them, and they grunt back [...] "awri" [...] and then go comfortably to sleep again. I knew one man who would actually get out and have a cold bath; and even that was of no use, for afterward he would jump into bed again to warm himself.|$|R

"Having now {{the honor}} and {{happiness}} {{to be put}} into Official friendship with those Gentlemen who, as Burgermeisters, and as old and as new Members of Council, have for long years made themselves renowned among us, I will entertain, in respect of the former [the old] a firm confidence That the zeal they have so strongly manifested for behoof of the most serene Archducal House of Austria will henceforth burn in them for our most Beloved Land's Prince whom God has now given us; that the fire of their lately plighted truth and devotion, towards his Royal Majesty, shall shine not in words only, but in works, and be extinguished only with their lives. [Can that be, O Spener or Speer? Are we <b>alarm-clocks,</b> that need only to be wound up, and told at what hour, and for whom?] God, who puts Kings in and casts them out, has given to us a no less potent Sovereign than supremely loving Land's-Father, who, by the renown of his more than royal virtues, had taken captive the hearts of his future subjects and children still sooner than even by his arms, familiar otherwise to victory, he did the Land. And who shall be puissant and mighty enough, now to lead men's minds in a contrary direction; to control the Most High Power, ruler over hearts and Lands, who had decreed it should be so; and again to change this change?

60|$|Evidently the hermit {{expected}} a visitor. He carefully combed {{his long hair}} and parted his apostolic beard. When the ninety-eight-cent <b>alarm-clock</b> on a stone shelf announced the hour of five {{he picked up his}} gunny-sacking skirts, brushed them carefully, gathered an oaken staff, and strolled slowly into the thick woods that surrounded the hermitage.|$|E
60|$|A {{young man}} {{came down the}} stairs from above {{just as she was}} {{opposite}} the lower step. He was decently dressed, but pale and haggard. His eyes were dull with the stress of some burden of physical or mental woe. In his hand he bore an onion--a pink, smooth, solid, shining onion as large around as a ninety-eight-cent <b>alarm-clock.</b>|$|E
60|$|A distant whistle, {{prolonged}} and shrieking, brought {{both of them}} {{to their}} feet. She glanced at the tin <b>alarm-clock</b> on the shelf. The hands stood at half-past five. The rest of the factory world was just arousing from sleep. She drew a shawl about her shoulders, and on her head put a dingy hat, shapeless and ancient.|$|E
60|$|She startled. She whimpered. It was {{the rapid}} ticking {{of the clock}} which had hypnotized her into hearing the steady hoofs. No aching color {{of the sea and}} pride of supercilious people, but the reality of a round-bellied nickel <b>alarm-clock</b> on a shelf against a fuzzy unplaned pine wall, with a stiff gray wash-rag hanging above it and a kerosene-stove {{standing}} below.|$|E

6000|$|The tin <b>alarm-clock</b> on {{the table}} ticked on, but Martin Eden, his face buried on his arms, did not hear it. He heard nothing. He did not think. So {{absolutely}} had he relived life that he had fainted just as he fainted years before on the Eighth Street Bridge. For a full minute the blackness and the blankness endured. Then, like one from the dead, he sprang upright, eyes flaming, sweat pouring down his face, shouting:- ...|$|E
60|$|A look, such as {{the young}} man with the banner might have borne {{with him to the}} fields of snow and ice, suffused the O'Kelly's {{handsome}} face. Without another word he crossed the road and entered an American store, where for six-and-elevenpence he purchased an <b>alarm-clock</b> the man assured us would awake an Egyptian mummy. With this in his hand he waved me a good-bye, and jumped upon a Hampstead 'bus, and alone I strolled on to the theatre.|$|E
60|$|The <b>alarm-clock</b> went off, jerking Martin out {{of sleep}} with a suddenness {{that would have given}} {{headache}} to one with less splendid constitution. Though he slept soundly, he awoke instantly, like a cat, and he awoke eagerly, glad that the five hours of unconsciousness were gone. He hated the oblivion of sleep. There was too much to do, too much of life to live. He grudged every moment of life sleep robbed him of, and before the clock had ceased its clattering he was head and ears in the washbasin and thrilling to the cold bite of the water.|$|E
60|$|Next to the {{pleasure}} of getting home from hunting late was {{the pleasure}} of starting early, as my boy and his brother sometimes did, to shoot ducks on the Little Reservoir in the fall. His brother had an <b>alarm-clock,</b> which he set at about four, and he was up the instant it rang, and pulling my boy out of bed, where he would rather have stayed than shot the largest mallard duck in the world. They raked the ashes off the bed of coals in the fireplace, and while the embers ticked and bristled, and flung out little showers of sparks, they hustled on their clothes, {{and ran down the}} back stairs into the yard with their guns.|$|E
60|$|Passing {{through the}} silent village, {{he heard the}} clock tell the mid hour of night. Hurrying on, he entered the mansion by a private door, the key of which hung in a secret outer place. Without undressing, he flung himself upon the bed. But remembering himself again, he rose and {{adjusted}} his <b>alarm-clock,</b> {{so that it would}} emphatically repeat the hour of five. Then to bed again, and driving off all intrudings of thoughtfulness, and resolutely bending himself to slumber, he by-and-by fell into its at first reluctant, but at last welcoming and hospitable arms. At five he rose; and in the east saw the first spears of the advanced-guard of the day.|$|E
6000|$|Joe obeyed, but {{he could}} not fall asleep so readily as the others. He lay with his eyes wide open, {{watching}} the hands of the <b>alarm-clock</b> that hung in the cabin, and thinking how quickly event had followed event in the last twelve hours. Only that very morning he had been a school-boy, and now he was a sailor, shipped on the Dazzler and bound he knew not whither. His fifteen years increased to twenty at the thought of it, and he felt every inch a man--a sailorman at that. He wished Charley and Fred could see him now. Well, they would hear of it soon enough. He could see them talking it over, and the other boys crowding around. [...] "Who?" [...] "Oh, Joe Bronson; he 's gone to sea. Used to chum with us." ...|$|E
6000|$|On one {{of these}} {{occasions}} the church clocks struck some small hour. It fell upon the ears of another person who sat bending over his books at a not very distant spot in the same city. Being Saturday night the morrow was one on which Jude had not set his <b>alarm-clock</b> to call him at his usually early time, and hence he had stayed up, as was his custom, {{two or three hours}} later than he could afford to do on any other day of the week. Just then he was earnestly reading from his Griesbach's text. At the very time that Sue was tossing and staring at her figures, the policeman and belated citizens passing along under his window might have heard, if they had stood still, strange syllables mumbled with fervour within--words that had for Jude an indescribable enchantment: inexplicable sounds something like these:-- ...|$|E
60|$|The rooks were {{awake in}} Randolph Crescent; but the windows looked down, discreetly blinded, {{on the return}} of the prodigal. John's pass-key was a recent privilege; {{this was the first time}} it had been used; and, O! with what a sickening sense of his unworthiness he now {{inserted}} it into the well-oiled lock and entered that citadel of the proprieties! All slept; the gas in the hall had been left faintly burning to light his return; a dreadful stillness reigned, broken by the deep ticking of the eight-day clock. He put the gas out, and sat on a chair in the hall, waiting and counting the minutes, longing for any human countenance. But when at last he heard the <b>alarm-clock</b> spring its rattle in the lower story, and the servants begin to be about, he instantly lost heart, and fled to his own room, where he threw himself upon the bed.|$|E
60|$|That evening Carl {{wrestled}} with the Turk for one hour, catch-as-catch-can, on the Turk's bed and under it and nearly out of the window, to prove the value of Professor Frazer and culture. Next morning Carl and the Turk enrolled in Frazer's optional course in modern poetry, a desultory series of lectures which did not attempt Tennyson and Browning. So Carl discovered Shelley and Keats and Walt Whitman, Swinburne and Rossetti and Morris. He had to read by crawling from word to word {{as though they were}} ice-cakes in a cataract of emotion. The allusiveness was agonizing. But he pulled off his shoes, rested his feet on the foot-board of his bed, drummed with a pair of scissors on his knee, and persisted in his violent pursuit of the beautiful. Meanwhile his room-mate, Plain Smith, flapped the pages of a Latin lexicon or took a little recreation by reading the Rev. Mr. Todd's Students' Manual, that gem of the <b>alarm-clock</b> and water-bucket epoch in American colleges.|$|E
60|$|As it is {{well known}} that all playwrights labor with toy theaters before them for working models, Mr. Wrenn ran to earth a fine {{unbroken}} pasteboard box in which a ninety-eight-cent <b>alarm-clock</b> had recently arrived. He went out for some glue and three small corks. Setting up his box stage, he glued a pill-box and a match-box on the floor--the side of the box it had always been till now--and there he had the mahogany desks. He thrust three matches into the corks, and behold three graceful actors--graceful for corks, at least. There was fascination in having them enter, through holes punched in the back of the box, frisk up to their desks and deliver magic emotional speeches that would cause any audience to weep; speeches regarding which he knew everything but the words; a detail of which he was still quite ignorant after half an hour of playing with his marionettes.|$|E
60|$|At last {{he found}} inside {{a book on}} motor fuels the wad of copy-paper on which he had scrawled notes with a broad, soft pencil, {{and he began to}} dictate a short article on air-cooling. Una was terrified lest she be unable to keep up, but she had read recent numbers of the Gazette thoroughly, she had practised the symbols for motor technologies, and she was not troubled by being watched. Indeed, Babson seemed to have enough to do in keeping his restless spirit from {{performing}} the dismaying feat of leaping straight out of his body. He leaned back in his revolving desk-chair with a complaining squawk from the spring, he closed his eyes, put his fingers together piously, then seized the chair-arms and held them, while he cocked one eye open and squinted at a large <b>alarm-clock</b> on the desk. He sighed profoundly, bent forward, gazed at his ankle, and reached forward to scratch it. All this time he was dictating, now rapidly, now gurgling and grunting while he paused to find a word.|$|E
60|$|As in all {{probability}} barely twelve months had elapsed since his last visit, the fact in itself was not surprising. Clearly the O'Kelly had been calculating time rather by sensation. I ordered a bottle; and we sat down. Myself, being prejudiced against the brand, I called {{for a glass of}} claret. The O'Kelly finished the bottle. I was glad to notice my ruse had been successful. The virtue of that wine had not departed from it. With every glass the O'Kelly became morally more elevated. He left the place, determined that he would be worthy of Mrs. O'Kelly. Walking down the Embankment, he asserted his determination of buying an <b>alarm-clock</b> that very evening. At the corner of Westminster Bridge he became suddenly absorbed in his own thoughts. Looking to discover the cause of his silence, I saw that his eyes were resting on a poster representing a charming lady standing on one leg upon a wire; below her--at some distance--appeared the peaks of mountains; the artist had even caught the likeness. I cursed the luck that had directed our footsteps, but the next moment, lacking experience, was inclined to be reassured.|$|E
6000|$|Scarlet and shadowy green, sequins of gold, slim {{shoulders}} veiled in costly mist. The {{glitter of}} spangles, the hissing of silk, low laughter, and continual music quieter than a dream. Crowds {{that were not}} harsh busy folk of the streets, but a nodding procession of gallant men and women. A kindly cleverness which inspirited her, and a dusky perfume in which she could meditate forever, like an Egyptian goddess throned {{at the end of}} incense-curtained aisles. Great tapestries of velvet and jeweled lights; swift, smiling servants; and the languorous well-being of eating strange, delicious foods. Orchids and the scent of poppies and spell of the lotos-flower, the bead of wine and lips that yearned; ecstasy in the Oriental pride of a superb Jewess who was singing to the demure enchantment of little violins. Her restlessness satisfied, a momentary pang of distrust healed by the brotherly talk of the broad-shouldered man who cared for her and nimbly fulfilled her every whim. An unvoiced desire to keep him from drinking so many highballs; an enduring thankfulness to him when she was back at the flat; a defiant joy that he had kissed her good-night--just once, and so tenderly; a determination to [...] "be good for him," [...] and a fear that he had [...] "spent too much money on her to-night," [...] and a plan to reason with him about whisky and extravagance. A sudden hatred of the office to which she would have to return in the morning, and a stronger, more sardonic hatred of hearing Mr. S. Herbert Ross pluck out his vest-pocket harp and hymn his own praise in a one-man choir, cherubic, but slightly fat. A descent from high gardens of moonlight to the reality of the flat, where Lawrence was breathing loudly in her sleep; the oily smell of hairs tangled in her old hair-brush; the sight of the <b>alarm-clock</b> which in just six hours would be flogging her off to the mill. A sudden, frightened query as to what scornful disdain Walter Babson would fling at her if he saw her glorying in this Broadway circus with the heavy Mr. Schwirtz. A ghostly night-born feeling that she still belonged to Walter, living or dead, and a wonder as to where in all the world he might be. A defiant protest that she idealized Walter, that he wasn't so awfully superior to the Champs du Pom-Pom as this astral body of his was pretending, and a still more defiant gratitude to Mr. Schwirtz as she crawled into the tousled bed and Mrs. Lawrence half woke to yawn, [...] "Oh, that--you--Gold'n? Gawd! I'm sleepy. Wha' time is 't?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Next to the {{pleasure}} of getting home from hunting late, was {{the pleasure}} of starting early, as my boy and his brother sometimes did, to shoot ducks on the Little Reservoir in the fall. His brother had an <b>alarm-clock,</b> which he set at about four, and he was up the instant it rang, and pulling my boy out of bed, where he would rather have stayed than shot the largest mallard duck in the world. They raked the ashes off the bed of coals in the fireplace, and while the embers ticked and bristled, and flung out little showers of sparks, they hustled on their clothes, {{and ran down the}} back stairs into the yard with their guns. Tip, the dog, was already waiting for them there, for he seemed to know they were going that morning, and he began whimpering for joy, and twisting himself sideways up against them, and nearly wagging his tail off; and licking their hands and faces, and kissing their guns all over; he was about crazy. When they started, he knew where they were going, and he rushed ahead through the silent little sleeping town, and led the way across the wide Commons, where the cows lay in dim bulks on the grass, and the geese waddled out of his way with wild clamorous cries, till they came in sight of the Reservoir. Then Tip fell back with my boy and let the elder brother go ahead, for he always had a right to the first shot; and while he dodged down behind the bank, and crept along to the place where the ducks usually were, my boy kept a hold on Tip's collar, and took in the beautiful mystery of the early morning. The place so familiar by day was estranged to his eyes in that pale light, and he was glad of old Tip's company, for it seemed a time when there might very well be ghosts about. The water stretched a sheet of smooth, gray silver, with little tufts of mist on its surface, and through these at last he could see the ducks softly gliding to and fro, and he could catch some dreamy sound from them. His heart stood still and then jumped wildly in his breast, as the still air was startled with the rush of wings, and the water broke with the plunge of other flocks arriving. Then he began to make those bets with himself that a boy hopes he will lose: he bet that his brother would not hit any of them; he bet that he did not even see them; he bet that if he did see them and got a shot at them, they would not come back so that he could get a chance himself to kill any. It seemed to him that he had to wait an hour, and just when he was going to hollo, and tell his brother where the ducks were, the old smoothbore sent out a red flash and a white puff before he heard the report; Tip tore loose from his grasp; and he heard the splashing rise of the ducks, and the hurtling rush of their wings; and he ran forward, yelling, [...] "How many did you hit? Where are they? Where are you? Are they coming back? It's my turn now!" [...] and making an outcry that would have frightened away a fleet of ironclads, but much less a flock of ducks.|$|E

For example, the audience will ring alarm-clocks whenever an <b>alarm-clock</b> rings in the movie and use flashlights when Hans Pfeiffer uses a pocket mirror to pinpoint the location of the Goths on a map behind the teacher in order to help a fellow student in history class. In 2006, more than 10,000 students participated in this tradition in Göttingen alone.|$|E

50|$|Knut Haukelid, who was {{the only}} trained {{commando}} in the immediate area, was informed of the German plan to remove the heavy water and advised {{he would have to}} muster support and destroy the shipment. He recruited two people. They decided to sabotage a ferry that would be carrying the heavy water across Lake Tinn. One of the people he recruited recognised a ferry crew member and talked to him, taking this advantage to slip {{into the bottom of the}} ship and plant the bomb, after which he slipped away. Eight and a half kilograms of plastic explosive with two <b>alarm-clock</b> fuses were fixed to the keel of the ferry, SF Hydro, which was to carry the railway cars with the heavy water drums across Lake Tinn. On 20 February 1944, shortly after setting off around midnight, the ferry and its cargo sank in deep water, finally capping the original mission's objective and halting Germany's atomic bomb development programme. A number of Norwegian civilians were killed as the ferry sank. Witnesses reported seeing steel drums floating after the sinking, leading to speculation that they did not really contain heavy water, but an examination of records after the war showed that some barrels were only half full, and therefore would have floated. A few of these may have been salvaged and transported to Germany.|$|E
5000|$|The {{chronology}} of the Murry-O'Keefe books is problematic at best. This {{is most likely}} because the books about Meg and her various family members were written {{over a period of}} decades and L'Engle did not take care to create a coherent timeline. Any attempt to tie character events and ages to real world chronology results in discrepancies. The worst discrepancy is the first moon landing (1969) being mentioned in A Wind in the Door as taking place well before A Wrinkle in Time (1963). Another is when 14-year-old Polly O'Keefe makes reference, about 28 years after Wrinkle (in Dragons in the Waters), to the present as being the [...] "end of the twentieth century". The Austin family book A Severed Wasp, which should take place over twenty years after Dragons based on character chronologies, makes the same end-of-century references. L'Engle refers to these stories as taking place in Kairos, which she defines {{in the front of the}} Many Waters hardback as [...] "real time, pure numbers with no measurement" [...] instead of [...] "ordinary, wrist-watch, <b>alarm-clock</b> time." [...] Nevertheless, it is possible to determine a plausible (albeit arbitrary) approximate date of 1970 for the events of A Wrinkle in Time. This would give Meg an approximate birth date of 1956. If Meg is 14 in A Wrinkle in Time (which is not definitively established in the book or elsewhere), then she is about 15 in A Wind in the Door, about 19 in Many Waters, about 24 in A Swiftly Tilting Planet, about 36 in The Arm of the Starfish, and about 42 as of An Acceptable Time. Reports about the unfinished book about Meg, The Eye Begins to See, place Meg as being in her forties or fifties.|$|E
