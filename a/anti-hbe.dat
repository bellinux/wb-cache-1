Traditionally, the presence of HBeAg in a host's serum is associated with much higher rates of viral replication and enhanced infectivity; however, variants of the [...] virus do not produce the 'e' antigen, so this rule does not always hold true. During the natural course of an infection, the HBeAg may be cleared, and antibodies to the 'e' antigen (<b>anti-HBe)</b> will arise immediately afterwards.

40|$|IgG subclasses of {{antibodies}} to hepatitis B e antigen (<b>anti-HBe)</b> complexed to HBeAg were determined in 126 HBsAg-positive sera. In the assay HBeAg complexes {{were bound to}} microtitre plates by monoclonal <b>anti-HBe</b> and indicated by biotinylated monoclonals {{to each of the}} four human IgG subclasses. To evaluate the specificity of the complexed IgG, serum dilutions were also tested for HBeAg and for subclasses of <b>anti-HBe</b> IgG. Two groups of sera were investigated: (i) 64 sera from 64 HBsAg carriers; and (ii) 62 sera from 13 HBeAg-positive patients, of whom five seroconverted to <b>anti-HBe.</b> At least four sera were available from each of these patients. Complexed <b>anti-HBe</b> IgG was detected in 22 of 30 HBeAg-positive, and in three of HBeAg-negative carrier sera. There was no significant association between presence of complexed <b>anti-HBe</b> and levels of HBeAg in these sera. Complexes with multiple subclass composition were found in 13 of the 25 sera with complexed <b>anti-HBe.</b> The most common IgG subclasses found complexed to HBeAg were IgG 1 (75 %) and IgG 4 (67 %). A significant association (P less than 0. 05) was found between the presence of free and complexed <b>anti-HBe</b> IgG 1 in the carrier sera, indicating that the IgG 1 antibodies, complexed to HBeAg, were specific for HBeAg. In the five patients who seroconverted to <b>anti-HBe,</b> <b>anti-HBe</b> IgG 1 was detected in the HBeAg-positive phase before seroconversion. In the eight patients with persistent HBeAg antigenemia, free <b>anti-HBe</b> IgG 1 was detected in only two sera from two different patients. In one patient, complexed <b>anti-HBe</b> IgG 1 /IgG 4 was detected in all serum samples drawn during a period of 111 months. In conclusion, complexed <b>anti-HBe</b> might be detected several years before apparent seroconversion to <b>anti-HBe</b> in conventional <b>anti-HBe</b> assays. In contrast 'free' <b>anti-HBe</b> IgG 1, when detected in HBeAg-positive sera with our <b>anti-HBe</b> subclass assay, seemed to signal ensuing apparent seroconversion to <b>anti-HBe...</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{the past}} years, HBeAg and <b>anti-HBe</b> status in {{individuals}} with positive HBsAg were often correlated to viral replication. This study was aimed to find {{correlation between the}} HBV viremia and HBeAg/anti-HBe serological status in HBsAg-positive individuals. Method: An observational-analytic design was performed in this study. The sera of all positive HBsAg patients at Biomedika Hospital Laboratory were collected and examined for HBeAg and <b>anti-HBe</b> using immunochromatography technique between January and April 2012. The sampling method was purposive sampling. Afterwards, the sera were examined for HBV-DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: Sufficient amount of sera were collected from 44 patients consisting of 33 males and 11 females. The mean age was 15 - 68 years. Positive HBeAg and negative <b>anti-HBe</b> status was found in 11 (42 %) patients. Negative HBeAg and positive <b>anti-HBe</b> was found in 26 (59. 1 %) patients. Both HBeAg and <b>anti-HBe</b> were negative in 7 (16. 3 %) patients.

40|$|Introduction: Mutation in pre-core {{region is}} {{characterized}} by negative HBeAg and positive <b>anti-HBe</b> despite active replications of the virus. The mutation has diagnostic and prognostic implications. Therefore, detectionof pre-core mutant is important. Standard diagnosis approach for detecting pre-core mutant is through DNA sequencing of hepatitis B virus (HBV) pre-core region. Unfortunately, DNA sequencing is not available in mostcenters. Hence, a simpler diagnostic approach is necessary. Method: An observational-analytic design study was performed. Detection of pre-core mutant was conducted in individuals with positive HBsAg and HBV DNA that had various patterns of HBeAg and anti HBe. HBsAg, HBeAg and <b>anti-HBe</b> was detected using immunochromatography technique. The HBV DNA was evaluated by using qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. PCR was done by three rounds of amplification with primers derived from wild type pre-core and mutant pre-core. Results: Of 25 sera with HBeAg negative, <b>anti-HBe</b> positive and HBV DNA positive, allele specific (AS) PCR pre-core mutant was detected in 20 (80 %) sera. Two sera with HBeAg negative, anti HBe negative and HBV DNA positive were negative for pre-core mutant. Of 8 sera with HBeAg positive, anti HBe negative and HBV DNA positive, pre-core mutant was detected in 2 (25 %) sera. Conclusion: Most of individuals with HBV DNA positive, HBeAg negative and <b>anti-HBe</b> positive have harbored pre-core mutant.

Methods: A total of 140 chronic HBV-infected pregnant women participated in this study. Before delivery, maternal HBV serological markers and HBV viral load were determined and <b>anti-HBe</b> titers were semi-quantified. Neonatal hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV-DNA status were determined from cord blood. The children were followed to age 1 – 3 years. Results: The HBV-DNA positive rate in cord blood was 75. 61 % (31 / 41) in those who were born to mothers with serum HBV-DNA > 106 IU/ml, which was significantly higher than in those who were born to mothers with HBV-DNA 106 IU/ml had no detectable HBV-DNA in cord blood; <b>anti-HBe</b> was positive with a median titer of 10 (interquartile range 10 – 55). A total of 84 children who received hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12  h after birth and who completed three doses of recombinant HBV vaccination were followed to age 1 – 3 years (up to May 2014). All 56 children who were born to mothers with serum HBV-DNA levels 106 IU/ml acquired an HBsAg-positive status. However, none of the six children who were born to anti-HBe-positive/weak-positive mothers with serum HBV-DNA > 106 IU/ml acquired an HBsAg-positive status.

40|$|The C gene of {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) codes for a nucleocapsid protein made of 183 amino acid residues and is preceded in phase by the precore (pre-C) region, encoding 29 residues.

HBV mutants with pre-C-region defects prevailed in the circulation of three asymptomatic carriers as they seroconverted from HBeAg to the corresponding antibody (<b>anti-HBe),</b> and these mutants finally replaced nondefective HBV. HBV DNA clones were propagated from sera of an additional 15 carriers with <b>anti-HBe</b> and sequenced for the pre-C region.

These findings indicate that, in chronic hepatitis type B, termination of virus replication is associated in most patients with biochemical and histologic regression of inflammatory activity. After <b>anti-HBe</b> seroconversion has occurred, virus replication and liver disease may persist or reactivate in {{a small proportion of}} patients thus giving origin to the well-recognized group of <b>anti-HBe</b> positive, hepatitis B virus DNA-positive chronic hepatitis type B...|$|E
40|$|Present study {{attempted}} {{to detect the}} biochemical and serological markers other than HBsAg of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in perspective of Bangladesh. Out of 100 HBsAg positive patients (79 male and 21 female), 23 {{were found to be}} HBeAg positive, and 59 were <b>anti-HBe</b> positive. Nineteen (24. 05 %) and 43 (54. 43 %) male patients were found to be HBeAg and <b>anti-HBe</b> positive, respectively; while 4 (19. 04 %) and 16 (76. 19 %) females were HBeAg and <b>anti-HBe</b> positive, respectively. Three males (3. 79 %) had abnormal serum bilirubin, 21 (26. 58 %) had abnormal ALT and 9 (11. 39 %) had abnormal AST levels; whereas, among the female patients, 1 (4. 76 %) had abnormal serum bilirubin, 2 (9. 52 %) had abnormal ALT and 1 (4. 76 %) had abnormal AST levels. Taken together, present findings suggest that HBeAg can be used as an alternate marker for detecting the active viral replication in HBV carriers with raised serum ALT levels...|$|E
40|$|We have cloned the X gene (HBx) and the HBc antigen (HBc Ag) gene {{of human}} {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) in Escherichia coli as fusion products with beta-galactosidase. Both HBV genes {{are expressed in}} E. coli strain CSR 603. Expression is detected by u. v. irradiation of the bacteria, metabolic labelling and electrophoresis of the labelled extracts on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The HBc Ag protein produced in bacteria can be recognised by anti-HBc sera and peptides derived from the protein are also recognised by <b>anti-HBe</b> sera. The HBx protein is recognised by some, but not all, sera which are <b>anti-HBe</b> positive. HBx Ag is also recognised by a woodchuck antibody similar to <b>anti-HBe</b> (anti-WHe). These results constitute the first proof that the open reading frame X is a true viral gene and is expressed during HBV (and WHV) infection and that an HBx/anti-HBx system, which may have important biological implications, can exist in parallel with the classic HBe/anti-HBe system...|$|E
40|$|Objective: <b>Anti-HBe</b> {{seroconversion}} and HBsAg loss {{are important}} therapeutic endpoints {{in patients with}} hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Quantitative measures of hepatitis B surface antigen (qHBsAg) and e antigen (qHBeAg) {{have been identified as}} potentially useful indicators of therapeutic response in HBV monoinfection. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine serological change including quantitative biomarkers in HIV-HBV coinfected patients initiating HBV active antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methods: HIV-HBV coinfected individuals from Thailand were followed for up to 168 weeks post ART. Rates and associations of qualitative serological change were determined. Longitudinal changes in qHBsAg and qHBeAg were measured and their utility as predictors of response examined. Results: Forty seven patients were included of whom 27 (57 %) were HBeAg positive at baseline. Median CD 4 count was 48 cells/mm 3. Over a median follow-up of 108 weeks 48 % (13 / 27) lost HBeAg, 12 / 27 (44 %) achieved <b>anti-HBe</b> seroconversion and 13 % (6 / 47) HBsAg loss. <b>Anti-HBe</b> seroconversion was associated with higher baseline ALT (p = 0. 034), lower qHBsAg (p = 0. 015), lower qHBeAg (p = 0. 031) and greater HBV DNA decline to week 24 (p = 0. 045). Sensitivity and specificity for qHBsAg and qHBeAg decline of. 0. 5 log at week 12 and. 1. 0 log at week 24 were high for both <b>anti-HBe</b> seroconversion and HBsAg loss...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: Infection with {{hepatitis}} B {{virus is}} a major life threatening situation {{for more than two}} billion people throughout the world. Many people are chronic carriers and suffer from this fatal infection. The majority of these carriers live in South East of Asia. In Iran, 3 percentages of the people are carriers of this virus. Molecular methods can detect the virus in serum even though the HBsAg is negative. The current study was designed to evaluate the number of copy of the HBV DNA in serum and cerumen and its relation to some immunological parameters. Materials and Methods: Seventy chronic hepatitis B patients with at least one year history of the disease and aged 20 - 40 years were enrolled in this study. Serum and cerumen samples were taken from each participant and kept at - 20 C. Diaplus Spine ELISA kit was used to measure some immunological parameters such as HBsAg, HBeAg and Anti HBe. In order to measure the copy number of HBV DNA, a quantitative Real Time PCR assay was performed using the BioRad detection PCR /USA) Tm CFX 96 system. Quantitative and qualitative parameters were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test and Pearson chi squared tests or Fisher's exact test, respectively. Results: All cases were HBsAg positive. 22 out of the 70 patients (31. 4 %) were HBeAg positive. 48 (68. 8 %) were HBsAg negative, 37 (53 %) <b>anti-HBe</b> positive and 11 (15. 6 %) were both <b>anti-HBe</b> and HBeAg negative. Patients who immunologically were <b>Anti-HBe</b> and HBeAg negative had the highest copy of HBV DNA among all CHB patients with different immunological properties compared to those who were either HBeAg positive, <b>anti-HBe</b> negative or HBeAg negative, <b>anti-HBe</b> positive with mean DNA copy of Mc= 2. 83 x 107 and 3. 37 x 108, respectively. Conclusion: The specificity of some immunological parameters such as HBeAg positive or negative, <b>Anti-HBe</b> positive or negative and simultaneous Anti-HBeAg and HBeAg negative in CHB patients can affect the mean HBV DNA copy number. This together with other parameters put the patients in different phases of the disease. Therefore, quantitative molecular methods performed on biological fluids like cerumen together with immunological parameters can help to manage the disease in CHB patients...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{serological}} markers of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) including e antigen (HBe Ag) and antibody against HBe Ag (<b>anti-HBe)</b> was performed in Senegalese patients suffering from cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular carcinoma, and in a control group (blood donors). It {{was not possible to}} diagnose additional HBV infections in primary hepatocellular carcinoma patients using HBe Ag or <b>anti-HBe</b> Ab alone as serological markers. The lower prevalence of HBe Ag among primary hepatocellular carcinoma patients as compared with cirrhotic patients suggests that active replication of HBV becomes increasingly defective {{during the course of the}} malignant process...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) strains from <b>anti-HBe</b> {{positive}} patients often show specific {{mutations in}} the precore gene, the core promoter region, or both. The dynamics of seroconversion {{in relation to}} the appearance of these mutations has not been studied and compared between defined HBV genotypes. Samples from patients followed during seroconversion from HBeAg to <b>anti-HBe</b> were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequenced and genotyped. Among 16 sets of samples, 6 belonged to genotype A, 6 to genotype D, 2 to genotype B, 1 to genotype C, and 1 to genotype E. Whereas strains from genotypes B, C and E showed changes in the core promoter, precore codon 28 or both, genotype A and D strains displayed a different pattern. In 4 of 6 <b>anti-HBe</b> positive samples from genotype A, the precore had a wild-type sequence while the core promoter sequence showed a specific TGA mutation. In another genotype A strain a precore stop mutation was preceded by a mutation in codon 15, thus conserving base-pairing at the pregenomic RNA level in this region. In contrast, all genotype D strains showed wild-type sequences in both the core promoter and precore codon 28 in pre- and post-seroconversion samples. Thus, in 8 patients with a mean follow-up time of 17 months, wild-type sequences in both the core promoter and precore codon 28 were found after seroconversion to <b>anti-HBe.</b> This study also confirmed, for genotype D, that HBeAg seroconversion often occurs earlier than genomic conversion...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{markers of}} HBV infection and detect {{the presence of}} its occult infection in serum of a cohort of adult Nigerians. Methodology: The study involved 28 adult Nigerians with viral hepatitis (Group 1) and 28 apparently healthy adult Nigerians as controls (Group 2). Their sera were assayed for HBsAg, HBeAg, <b>anti-HBe,</b> anti-HBc, anti-HBs, and anti-HCV, while HBV DNA was determined in 15 patients with chronic hepatitis. Significance of differences between the patients and control subjects was assessed using Chi-square test at a 95 % confidence level. Results: Sero-detection of HBsAg, HBeAg, <b>anti-HBe</b> and anti-HBc was higher among the patients compared to the controls. HBV infection was diagnosed by HBsAg (89 %) and a duo of HBsAg and anti-HBc (100 %) among the patients. Similarly, eleven and four types of different patterns of HBV markers were observed among the respective groups. <b>Anti-HBe</b> (9. 5 %), anti-HBc (14. 3 %), and anti-HBs (9. 5 %) were detected among all the subjects who were sero-negative for HBsAg. HBV DNA was also detected in 86. 7 % of the 15 patients with chronic hepatitis, while occult HBV infection was observed in 7. 2 % of the patients and none (0 %) of the controls, p < 0. 05. Furthermore, HCV infection occurred among subjects with all the different patterns of HBV markers, except those with occult HBV infection and natural immunity to HBV. Conclusion: This study shows that occult HBV infection is present among Nigerian adults and determination of HBsAg, anti-HBc, <b>anti-HBe,</b> and HBV DNA will assist in its detection...|$|E
40|$|The {{antiviral}} and immunomodulatory {{effects of}} interferon were assessed {{in the treatment}} of chronic hepatitis B in multi-ethnic patients to prevent viral replication and chronic liver damage. Five million units of recombinant interferon alpha- 2 b were administered three times a week for 48 weeks to a group of 18 chronic active hepatitis B patients. A complete response was defined as seroconversion to <b>anti-HBe</b> and/or loss of HBe antigen. Seroconversion to <b>anti-HBe</b> in 5 of 12 (42 %) chronic active hepatitis B patients occurred after 48 weeks of therapy. HBV-DNA decreased to undetectable levels in 8 of 12 (67 %) patients. This chronic low-dose interferon administration regimen demonstrated responses comparable to other studies...|$|E
40|$|In 44 {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) carriers {{with chronic}} persistent hepatitis (CPH), serial liver biopsies were available. At presentation 38 patients had HBV-DNA in their serum including 31 HBeAg positive and seven <b>anti-HBe</b> positive cases. The remaining six patients were <b>anti-HBe</b> positive and HBV-DNA negative. During a mean histologic follow-up of 4. 2 years, 12 (32 %) of the 38 HBV-DNA positive patients progressed to chronic active hepatitis (six cases) or to active cirrhosis (six cases), while 26 patients showed either unchanged features of CPH (21 cases), or histologic improvement to normal liver (five cases). Persistence of HBV-DNA in serum, independently of HBeAg/anti-HBe events, was significantly (p less than 0. 01) associated with deterioration of liver disease, while termination of HBV replication correlated significantly (p less than 0. 05) with spontaneous biochemical remission and with unchanged or improved histology. None of the six <b>anti-HBe</b> positive patients without serologic markers of hepatitis B virus replication showed histologic deterioration. These findings indicate that continuing HBV replication is a marker which predicts unfavourable evolution of {{chronic persistent hepatitis}} and frequent transition to chronic active hepatitis or cirrhosis...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody (anti-HBs), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and antibody (<b>anti-HBe),</b> {{the nature of}} T-cell function, and specific cell-mediated immunity to HBsAg were determined and evaluated serially in groups of subjects with chronic HBsAg carrier states and in seronegative controls. The techniques of in vitro lymphocyte transformation, spontaneous rosette formation, radioimmunoassay, reverse passive hemagglutination, passive hemagglutination, rheophoresis, and liver function tests were employed for these studies. For the lymphocyte transformation assay, multiple concentrations of phytohemagglutinin and purified HBsAg were used as stimulants. Cell-mediated immunity to HBsAg was detectable in 50 % of the chronic HBsAg carriers (responders) at one or more concentrations of HBsAg. The remaining carriers (nonresponders) and controls failed to manifest HBsAg-specific lymphocyte transformation activity. The profile of the responders was characterized by elevated serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase levels, the {{presence of}} <b>anti-HBe,</b> high HBsAg titers, and the conspicuous absence of HBeAg in the serum. The nonresponders were characterized by normal serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase levels, the presence of HBeAg and <b>anti-HBe,</b> and lower HBsAg titers. These observations demonstrate the presence of specific cell-mediated immunity to HBsAg in chronic HBsAg carriers who manifest biochemical evidence of liver disease...|$|E
