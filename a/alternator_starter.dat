50|$|General Motors {{introduced}} a mild hybrid system called belt <b>alternator</b> <b>starter</b> (or BAS) in the 2007 Saturn Vue Green Line. The BAS system {{is also used}} in the Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid. It operates similarly to other mild hybrids with a start-stop system, in that it shuts down the engine as the vehicle {{comes to a stop}} and instantly restarts it when the brake pedal is released.|$|E
50|$|BAS is {{an acronym}} for belted <b>alternator</b> <b>starter.</b> It is a {{category}} of automotive parallel hybrid technology that uses an electric motor to contribute power to the internal combustion engine's crankshaft via a serpentine belt. By mounting this motor generator unit in the conventional location traditionally used for the standard automotive alternator, it permits a low-cost method of adding mild hybrid capabilities such as start-stop, power assist, and mild levels of regenerative braking. BAS differ from other mild hybrid systems as they are not run off the vehicle's crankshaft.|$|E

50|$|In {{the second}} year of the Challenge X {{competition}}, HEVT was the first place team (Gurski). Virginia Tech's competition entry, the REVLSE (Renewable Energy Vehicle, the Larsen Special Edition) is a split parallel hybrid using a Ballard Ranger 67 kW ACI rear traction motor, an 8 kW MES belted <b>alternator</b> <b>starter,</b> and a Saab 2.0 L Flex Fuel SI engine running on E85 - an ethanol/gas blend. Virginia Tech also won first place in lowest well-to-wheels petroleum energy usage, with an overall reduction of petroleum consumption of 74 percent over the stock vehicle, best written technical reports, lowest regulated tailpipe emissions, and lowest time braking and handling (Challenge X).|$|E
5000|$|At the LA Auto Show, on November 15, 2010, General Motors {{announced}} that it would be releasing an all-new version of the BAS system available in the 2012 Buick LaCrosse. While still a Belted <b>Alternator</b> <b>Starter</b> system, the system is named eAssist and includes a larger more powerful Hitachi-supplied 115 Volt Lithium Ion battery and a [...] motor-generator that delivers 79 lbft Nm of torque. The additional power provided by the more powerful battery and motor provides the ability to contribute more power, and more often able to electrically start and assist the 2.4L engine. The eAssist system also includes a specially modified GM 6T40 6-speed automatic FWD transaxle.|$|E
50|$|General Motors mild hybrids {{including}} the Parallel Hybrid Truck (PHT) and numerous cars and SUVs {{equipped with the}} BAS Hybrid system, often use a 36- to 48-volt system to supply the power needed for the startup motor, {{as well as a}} source of power to compensate for the increasing number of electronic accessories on modern vehicles. GM's Belt <b>alternator</b> <b>starter</b> (BAS) mild hybrid system uses a belt drive to start the internal combustion engine (ICE) through its motor-generator unit (MGU), then once started the engine drives the 14.5 kW motor-generator to charge the batteries. The BAS hybrid system also utilizes regenerative braking to replenish the system's 36 V battery and can provide moderate levels of power assist. According to the EPA, a 2009 Saturn Vue Greenline equipped with the BAS Hybrid system delivers a 27% improvement in combined fuel economy over the non-hybrid version (FWD 4cyl).|$|E

5000|$|The F160 is a 60° V6 {{gasoline}} engine that displaces [...] It utilizes a turbocharger for each cylinder bank, twin intercoolers and direct injection. The engine is designed by Ferrari (loosely based on Pentastar engine block) and assembled by Ferrari; specifically, the engine blocks are cast and machined to Ferrari's approved specifications respectively in Chrysler's Kokomo, Indiana and Trenton Engine Plant, then shipped to Modena, Italy for assembly by Ferrari. This engine shares bore and combustion chamber design, the same valves control technology (i.e. roller finger followers and four cam phasers), the same twin turbocharging approach and direct injection-ignition system with Ferrari F154 engine. The engine auxiliaries are identical (<b>alternator,</b> <b>starter</b> motor and power steering pump) or very similar (variable displacement oil pump). The difference of F160 from F154: F160 engine block {{is made by}} high pressure die cast (HPDC) process which is extremely suitable for high volume production. However, it is open deck type and can't endure to high specific power in HP/liter. F160 doesn't have an overboost function and is not used in Ferrari cars either (both F136 and F154 engines are used in Ferrari cars as well). Ferrari was responsible for design and bench testing of this engine.|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyses}} the Energy Management System (EMS) of a Euro 6 C-segment parallel Plug-In Hybrid (PHEV) {{available on}} the European market, equipped with a Flywheel <b>Alternator</b> <b>Starter</b> (FAS). The car has various selectable operating modes, such as the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV), Blended and Sport, characterized by a different usage of the electric driving with significant effects on the electric range and on CO 2 emissions. The different hybrid control strategies were investigated applying the UNECE Regulation 83, used for the European type approval procedure, along the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). To evaluate {{the influence of the}} forthcoming Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC), which will replace the NEDC from September 2017, this testing procedure was also applied. Vehicle testing was carried out on a two-axle chassis dynamometer at the Vehicle Emission LAboratory (VELA) of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission. Through a limited amount of information, obtained as the results of the type approval procedure together with the characterization of the high voltage battery, it was possible to highlight, both in Charge Depleting and Charge Sustaining conditions, how the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) works {{as a function of the}} battery State of Charge (SOC), vehicle speed, acceleration and coolant temperature. Moreover, the impact of different vehicle operating modes on CO 2 emissions and Electric Range, computed as prescribed by the European regulation, was clearly highlighted for the considered driving cycles, pointing out differences of about 20 % in terms of electrical range, and of more than 70 % in terms of CO 2 emissions.
