5000|$|Hal Ambler, {{a former}} Consular Operations {{agent in the}} Political Stabilization Unit, is kept heavily {{medicated}} and closely watched in a psychiatric facility just off the US coast. However, Ambler is unique amongst the other patients in the Parrish Island psychiatric facility, because he is perfectly sane. With {{the help of a}} sympathetic nurse, Ambler manages to clear his mind of the drug-induced haze and stage a daring escape off the island. Although he is desperate to discover who put him on Parrish Island and why, the world in which he returns appears to have conveniently forgotten him. Friends and associates no longer recognize him, no official records of his existence are to be found, and the face he sees in the mirror is not his own. After contacting several old associates who do not recognize him or even have any recollection of his existence, Ambler goes to a cabin in certain part of country which had always been his lone solace even during his days as a field agent. He arrives to find no cabin, and the landscape looked such that there hadn't been any before. A tranquillizer dart armed with carfetanyl then strikes him, but does not affect his thought processes severely [...] He tracks down the sniper and forces the sniper, a freelance operative, to give him <b>authorisation</b> <b>codes.</b> However, before the operative can be milked for more information, he is killed by a sniper whose single bullet also grazed Ambler's neck. He then contacts the agency that is tracking him down. Ambler comes in contact with agents from his past in the Political Stabilization Unit. Among those is Osiris, a blind operative who had an uncanny linguistic ability and has also regarded Ambler as his close friend. His friend is subsequently shot and killed by a Chinese intelligence officer independent of the organization Ambler is being hired by, who believes Ambler wants to assassinate the Chinese head of state. He uncovers a conspiracy involving a State Department official to kill the Chinese President, in order to hinder the shift in power and to restore the old world order of Pax Americana, in accordance with her university lecturer, Ashton Palmer's fanatical ideals. Ambler manages to unravel the conspiracy, {{while at the same time}} discovering that the nurse who had freed him and supposedly helped him on his endeavours to find out more about himself was in league with the [...] "Palmerites", or so those who conform to Palmer's ideals are called. Ambler's ability to determine others' emotions and pick up even the slightest of change in facial expression is foiled, for the nurse was trained in Method acting. At the end of the book, Ambler is seen to be lounging with the desk-jockey CIA officer who had assisted him in self-discovery and the foiling of the conspiracy.|$|E

The watermark is capable of carrying such information as authentication or <b>authorisation</b> <b>codes,</b> or even a legend essential for image interpretation. This capability is envisaged to find application in image tagging, copyright enforcement, counterfeit protection, and controlled access to image data. Two methods of implementation are discussed.

The second method utilises linear addition of the water mark to the image data, and is thus more difficult to decode, and therefore offers inherent security. ...|$|E

40|$|Personal {{identification}} of individuals {{is becoming increasingly}} adopted in society today. Due to {{the large number of}} electronic systems that require human identification, faster and more secure identification systems are pursued. Biometrics is based upon the physical characteristics of individuals; of these the fingerprint is the most common as used within law enforcement. Fingerprint-based systems have been introduced into the society but have not been well received due to relatively high rejection rates and false acceptance rates. This limited acceptance of fingerprint identification systems requires new techniques to be investigated to improve this identification method and the acceptance of the technology within society. Electronic fingerprint identification provides a method of identifying an individual within seconds quickly and easily. The fingerprint must be captured instantly to allow the system to identify the individual without any technical user interaction to simplify system operation. The performance of the entire system relies heavily {{on the quality of the}} original fingerprint image that is captured digitally. A single fingerprint scan for verification makes it easier for users accessing the system as it replaces the need to remember passwords or <b>authorisation</b> <b>codes.</b> The identification system comprises of several components to perform this function, which includes a fingerprint sensor, processor, feature extraction and verification algorithms. A compact texture feature extraction method will be implemented within an embedded microprocessor-based system for security, performance and cost effective production over currently available commercial fingerprint identification systems. To perform these functions various software packages are available for developing programs for windows-based operating systems but must not constrain to a graphical user interface alone. MATLAB was the software package chosen for this thesis due to its strong mathematical library, data analysis and image analysis libraries and capability. MATLAB enables the complete fingerprint identification system to be developed and implemented within a PC environment and also to be exported at a later date directly to an embedded processing environment. The nucleus of the fingerprint identification system is the feature extraction approach presented in this thesis that uses global texture information unlike traditional local information in minutiae-based identification methods. Commercial solid-state sensors such as the type selected for use in this thesis have a limited contact area with the fingertip and therefore only sample a limited portion of the fingerprint. This limits the number of minutiae that can be extracted from the fingerprint and as such limits the number of common singular points between two impressions of the same fingerprint. The application of texture feature extraction will be tested using variety of fingerprint images to determine the most appropriate format for use within the embedded system. This thesis has focused on designing a fingerprint-based identification system that is highly expandable using the MATLAB environment. The main components that are defined within this thesis are the hardware design, image capture, image processing and feature extraction methods. Selection of the final system components for this electronic fingerprint identification system was determined by using specific criteria to yield the highest performance from an embedded processing environment. These platforms are very cost effective and will allow fingerprint-based identification technology to be implemented in more commercial products that can benefit from the security and simplicity of a fingerprint identification system...|$|E

5000|$|Mobile number {{portability}} is implemented {{in different ways}} across the globe. The International and European standard is for a customer wishing to port his/her number to contact the new network (recipient), which then sends the {{number portability}} request (NPR) to the current network (donor). This is known as [...] "recipient-led" [...] porting. The UK and India are the only exceptions to implement the donor-led system. The customer wishing to port his/her number is required to contact the donor to obtain a <b>code</b> (Porting <b>Authorisation</b> <b>Code</b> (PAC) in the UK and Unique Porting Code (UPC) in India) which is then given to the recipient network. The recipient continues the porting process by contacting the donor with a porting code. This form of porting is known as [...] "donor-led" [...] and has been criticised by some industry analysts as being inefficient, though it prevents MNP scams. It has also been observed that it may act as customer deterrent as well as allowing the donor an opportunity of [...] "winning back" [...] the customer.

40|$|This thesis investigates user privacy {{concerns}} {{associated with the}} use of location based services. We begin by introducing various privacy schemes relevant to the use of location based services. We introduce the notion of constraints, i. e. statements limiting the use and dis tribution of Location Information (LI), i. e. data providing information regarding a subject's location. Constraints can be securely bound to LI, and are designed to reduce threats to privacy by controlling its dissemination and use. The various types of constraint which may be required are also considered. The issues and risks with the possible use of constraints are discussed, as are possible solutions to these hazards. To address some of the problems that have been identified with the use of constraints, we introduce the notion of an LI Preference Authority (LIPA). A LIPA is a trusted party which can examine LI constraints and make decisions about LI distribution without revealing the constraints to the entity requesting the LI. This is achieved by encrypting both the LI and the constraints with a LIPA encryption key, ensuring that the LI is only revealed at the discretion of the LIPA. We further show how trusted computing can be used to enhance privacy for LI. We focus on how the mechanisms in the Trusted Computing Group specifications can be used to enable the holder of LI to verify the trustworthiness of a remote host before transferring the LI to that remote device. This provides greater assurance to end users that their expressed preferences for the handling of personal information will be respected. The model for the control of LI described in this thesis has close parallels to models controlling the dissemination and use of other personal information. In particular, Park and Sandhu have developed a general access control model intended to address issues such as Digital Rights Management, <b>code</b> <b>authorisation,</b> and the control of personal data. We show how our model for LI control fits into this general access control model. We present a generic service which allows a device to discover the location of other devices in ad hoc networks. The advantages of the service are discussed in several scenarios, where the reliance on an infrastructure such as GPS satellites or GSM cellular base stations is not needed. An outline of the technology which will be needed to realise the service is given, along with a look at the security issues which surround the use of this location discovery service. Finally, we provide conclusions and suggestions for future work...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with authorisation issues for mobile code in mobile systems. It {{is divided into three}} main parts. Part I covers the development of a policy-based framework for the <b>authorisation</b> of mobile <b>code</b> and agents by host systems. Part II addresses the secure download, storage and execution of a conditional access application, used in the secure distribution of digital video broadcast content. Part III explores the way in which trusted computing technology may be used in the robust implementation of OMA DRM version 2. In part I of this thesis, we construct a policy-based mobile <b>code</b> and agent <b>authorisation</b> framework, with the objective of providing both mobile devices and service providers with the ability to assign appropriate privileges to incoming executables. Whilst mobile <b>code</b> and agent <b>authorisation</b> mechanisms have previously been considered in a general context, this thesis focuses on the special requirements resulting from mobile <b>code</b> and agent <b>authorisation</b> in a mobile environment, which restrict the types of solutions that may be viable. Following the description and analysis of a number of architectural models upon which a policy-based framework for mobile <b>code</b> and agent <b>authorisation</b> may be constructed, we outline a list of features desirable in the definitive underlying architecture. Specific implementation requirements for the capabilities of the policy and attribute certificate specification languages and the associated policy engine are then extracted. Candidate policy specification languages, namely KeyNote (and Nereus), Ponder (and (D) TPL) and SAML are then examined, and conclusions drawn regarding their suitability for framework expression. Finally, the definitive policy based framework for mobile <b>code</b> and agent <b>authorisation</b> is described. In the second part of this thesis, a flexible approach that allows consumer products to support a wide range of proprietary content protection systems, or more specifically digital video broadcast conditional access systems, is proposed. Two protocols for the secure download of content protection software to mobile devices are described. The protocols apply concepts from trusted computing to demonstrate that a platform is in a sufficiently trustworthy state before any application or associated keys are securely downloaded. The protocols are designed to allow mobile devices to receive broadcast content protected by proprietary conditional access applications. Generic protocols are first described, followed by an analysis of how well the downloaded code is protected in transmission. How the generic protocols may be implemented using specific trusted computing technologies is then investigated. For each of the selected trusted computing technologies, an analysis of how the conditional access application is protected while in storage and while executing on the mobile host is also presented. We then examine two previously proposed download protocols, which assume a mobile receiver compliant with the XOM and AEGIS system architectures. Both protocols are then analysed against the security requirements defined for secure application download, storage and execution. We subsequently give a series of proposed enhancements to the protocols which are designed to address the identified shortcomings. In the final section of this thesis, we examine OMA DRM version 2, which defines the messages, protocols and mechanisms necessary in order to control the use of digital content in a mobile environment. However, an organisation, such as the CMLA, must specify how robust implementations of the OMA DRM version 2 specification should be, so that content providers can be confident that their content will be safe on OMA DRM version 2 devices. We take the requirements extracted for the robust implementation of the OMA DRM version 2 specification and propose an implementation which meets these requirements using the TCG architecture and TPM/TSS version 1. 2 commands...|$|R
