Force-directed graph-drawing algorithms {{are widely used}} to draw such graphs. However, these methods do not guarantee a sub-quadratic running time in general.

Given a graph G=(V,E), the asymptotic worst-case running time of this method is O(|V|log|V|+|E|) with linear memory requirements. In practice, the algorithm generates nice drawings of graphs with 100000 nodes in less than 5 minutes.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{recent work}} on the BIDMach toolkit for large-scale machine learning. BIDMach has demonstrated single-node performance that exceeds that of published cluster systems for many common machine-learning task. BIDMach makes full use of both CPU and GPU acceleration (through a sister library BID-Mat), and requires only modest hardware (commodity GPUs). One of the chal-lenges of reaching this level of performance is the allocation barrier. While it is simple and expedient to allocate <b>and</b> recycle matrix (<b>or</b> <b>graph)</b> objects in ex-pressions, this approach is too slow to match the arithmetic throughput possible on either GPUs or CPUs. In this paper we describe a caching approach that al-lows code with complex matrix (graph) expressions to run at massive scale, i. e. multi-terabyte data, with zero memory allocation after initial start-up. We present {{a number of new}} benchmarks that leverage this approach. ...|$|R

The personalization starts with defining of sequence of study courses build on individual study plan for the particular learner. This activity is supported by a <b>AND</b> – <b>OR</b> <b>graph</b> representing the structure of study programme.

Non-flat image features {{are those that}} live on Riemannian manifolds, instead of Euclidean spaces. Familiar examples include the orientation feature (from optical flows or gradient flows) that lives on the unit circle S&sup 1;, the alignment feature (from fingerprint waves or certain texture images) that lives on the real projective line RP&sup 1;, and the chromaticity feature (from color images) that lives on the unit sphere S&sup 2;. In this paper, we apply the variational method to the restoration of non-flat image features. General mathematical models for both continuous image domains <b>and</b> discrete domains (<b>or</b> <b>graphs)</b> are constructed. Riemannian objects such as metric, distance and Levi-Civita connection play important roles. We also discuss efficient computational algorithms for the non-linear restoration equations.

It ensures that they understand how the algorithms function, it provides them with experience in turning theoretical results into usable tools, and it demonstrates how theoretical time bounds translate (or fail to translate) into actual running times.

First, we study {{the problem of}} approximating the permanent and generating weighted perfect matchings in bipartite graphs from their correct distribution. We present a perfect sampling algorithm using self-reducible acceptance/rejection and an upper bound for the permanent. It has a polynomial expected running time for a class of dense problems, and it gives an improvement in running time {{by a factor of}} $n^ 3 $ for matrices that are (. 6) -dense. Next, we apply the similar approach to study perfect matchings in nonbipartite graphs and also general matchings in general graphs. Our algorithms here have a subexponential expected running time for some classes of nontrivial graphs and are competitive with other Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Dissertatio...|$|R
