30|$|Our results {{revealed}} {{an inverse relationship}} between snowmelt anomaly and total <b>annual</b> <b>area</b> burned in the Middle Rockies Ecoregion from 1984 to 2012. An earlier spring snowmelt was correlated with above-average <b>annual</b> <b>area</b> burned. These results support the findings of others (Medler et al. 2002, Westerling et al. 2006, Semmens and Ramage 2012). The implications of our findings are especially critical because the average <b>annual</b> <b>area</b> burned in the western US is projected to increase further, and years without fires are predicted to be increasingly rare (Westerling et al. 2011). Additionally, as the climate changes in the US Mountain West, snow is expected to melt progressively {{earlier in the season}} (Stewart 2009). Our findings suggest that snowmelt occurring earlier in the coming decades will exacerbate wildfire risk. If this relationship continues to persist, we can expect an increase of wildfire <b>annual</b> <b>area</b> burned in the twenty-first century.|$|R

How climate change influences the severity of biomass burning has proved difficult to assess. Here, we examined the depth of ground-layer combustion in 178 sites dominated by black spruce in Alaska, using data collected from 31 fire events between 1983 and 2005.

30|$|The {{interactions}} between climate and wildland fire are complex. To better understand these interactions, we used ArcMap 10.2. 2 {{to examine the}} relationships between early spring snowmelt and total <b>annual</b> <b>area</b> burned within a defined region of the Rocky Mountains of the western United States. Our research methods used Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) fire perimeter data and weekly snow extent provided by the Rutgers Global Snow Lab analysis of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) daily snow maps. Our results indicated a significant correlation between early spring snowmelt and total <b>annual</b> <b>area</b> burned (P = 0.0497), providing further evidence that snowmelt timing may be a driving factor for wildland fires. This project builds {{on the findings of}} previous studies and provides a novel method for making general predictions about the upcoming fire season months in advance, using freely available remotely sensed data in real time. Further research should apply our model to a broader geographic area, and incorporate higher resolution snowmelt timing data.|$|R
40|$|Prescribed fire {{is practiced}} {{around the world}} to reduce the effect of {{unplanned}} fire, but we hypothesise that its effectiveness is proportional to the mean <b>annual</b> <b>area</b> burnt by unplanned fire, which varies among biomes. Fire history mapping was obtained for six global case studies from a range of biomes: Portugal, Spain (both Mediterranean), Alberta (boreal Canada), Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks (montane USA), the Sandy Desert (arid Australia) and Kruger National Park (South African savanna). Leverage is the unit reduction in unplanned fire area resulting from one unit of previous fire as measured at a regional scale over a long period. We calculated leverage for each case study using statistical modelling of <b>annual</b> <b>area</b> burnt, controlling for annual climatic variation. We combined the six leverage values with those from four previously published cases to conduct a global test of our hypothesis. Leverage was high in Portugal (~ 0. 9) and moderate in the Sandy Desert (~ 0. 3). However, the other case studies showed no evidence of leverage: burnt area was not influenced by past fire. In all regions, climatic variation had more influence than past <b>area</b> burnt on <b>annual</b> <b>area</b> burnt. The global analysis revealed a positive relationship between mean area burnt and leverage but only when outlying cases were removed. In biomes with low fire activity, prescribed fire is unlikely to reduce unplanned fire area at all, while for many others, the return for effort is likely to be low.

30|$|The {{link between}} {{snowmelt}} and <b>annual</b> <b>area</b> burned is apparent {{for the large}} increase in fire activity from 2000 to 2012, which coincides with a decade of early snowmelt (Figure 2). Indeed, aside from 1988, all above-average fire years occur within the 2000 to 2012 subset (Figure 3). Examination of the scatterplot (Figure 3) reveals a clear pattern {{that the majority of}} above-average fire years follow an early snowmelt anomaly, similar to findings in Medler et al. (2002). We can see in the full period of record {{that there is only one}} point (1988) that experiences a higher than average fire season following a positive snowmelt anomaly (later than average snowmelt date). All other above-average fire years follow a negative snowmelt anomaly (earlier than normal melt). There are many years with a low total <b>annual</b> <b>area</b> burned, regardless of the snowmelt anomaly. However, the years with high fire totals almost exclusively follow early snowmelt anomalies. This indicates that late snowmelt anomaly has a suppressive effect on wildfires, whereas early snowmelt anomalies are one factor in many that contribute to large fire years.|$|R
40|$|The {{boreal forest}} {{contains}} large reserves of carbon, and across this region wildfire {{is a common}} occurrence.

30|$|Fire frequency, area burned, {{and fire}} {{severity}} are important attributes {{of a fire}} regime, but few studies have quantified the interrelationships among them in evaluating a fire year. Although area burned {{is often used to}} summarize a fire season, burned area may not be well correlated with either the number or ecological effect of fires. Using the Landsat data archive, we examined all 148 wildland fires (prescribed fires and wildfires) > 40 ha from 1984 through 2009 for the portion of the Sierra Nevada centered on Yosemite National Park, California, USA. We calculated mean fire frequency and mean <b>annual</b> <b>area</b> burned from a combination of field- and satellite-derived data. We used the continuous probability distribution of the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) values to describe fire severity. For fires > 40 ha, fire frequency, <b>annual</b> <b>area</b> burned, and cumulative severity were consistent in only 13 of 26 years (50 %), but all pair-wise comparisons among these fire regime attributes were significant. Borrowing from long-established practice in climate science, we defined “fire normals” to be the 26 year means of fire frequency, <b>annual</b> <b>area</b> burned, and the area under the cumulative probability distribution of dNBR. Fire severity normals were significantly lower when they were aggregated by year compared to aggregation by area. Cumulative severity distributions for each year were best modeled with Weibull functions (all 26 years, r 2 ≥ 0.99; P < 0.001). Explicit modeling of the cumulative severity distributions may allow more comprehensive modeling of climate-severity and area-severity relationships. Together, the three metrics of number of fires, size of fires, and severity of fires provide land managers with a more comprehensive summary of a given fire year than any single metric.|$|R
30|$|We have {{presented}} a novel method of comparing snowmelt data and fire occurrence using fine-scale resolution NOAA snow and MTBS fire data. We have improved upon existing methods by combining remotely sensed data with an algorithm that temporally averages snowmelt timing, better identifying the DOY when snow leaves the landscape. The fire regimes of various ecosystems respond differently to climatic conditions (Littell et al. 2009). Our model allows for simple comparison of snowmelt timing and <b>annual</b> <b>area</b> burned {{in a region}} of interest, and could easily be adapted across the continent or anywhere else that has a high-quality fire dataset. Further investigation could use our model on more EPA ecoregions, or improve upon {{the resolution of the}} snow extent data. Our findings bolster the results of previous studies, and further elucidate early spring snowmelt as a correlate of increased <b>annual</b> <b>area</b> burned. As snow continues to melt earlier each decade as a result of climate change, understanding this system may become increasingly important for wildfire management. Our model provides a novel tool for making general predictions about the upcoming fire season months in advance, and warrants extensive further investigation.|$|R
30|$|Early {{snowmelt}} {{is one way}} {{to achieve}} low fuel moisture and extended fire seasons leading to increased <b>annual</b> <b>area</b> burned, yet it is certainly not the only mechanism. Climate indirectly affects wildfire occurrence, through control over fuel moisture (Gedalof et al. 2005, Miller et al. 2008, Littell et al. 2009, Fauria et al. 2011, Higuera et al. 2015). Dry fuel loads with adequate ignitions lead to wildfires. Fuel moisture is influenced by a variety of ecological and climatic processes including high summer temperatures, drought, and snowmelt timing. Of all the factors that lead to low fuel moisture, snowmelt timing is one of the earliest predictors, occurring several months before the fire season begins. Drought indexes, fuel moisture metrics, and spring-summer temperatures may be more highly correlated with <b>annual</b> <b>area</b> burned (Gedalof et al. 2005, Westerling et al. 2006, Miller et al. 2008, Spracklen et al. 2009, Higuera et al. 2015), but are temporally concurrent with wildfire season. Our model of classifying early snowmelt timing using Rutgers Global Snow Lab analysis of NOAA daily snow maps may provide months of foresight for wildland fire managers.|$|R

30|$|The {{years with}} the most {{extensive}} <b>annual</b> <b>area</b> burned are associated with high cumulative severity, and the years with low <b>annual</b> <b>area</b> burned are associated with low cumulative fire severity (Table 1). However, the association often depends {{on the size of}} large fires and the vegetation type in which the fire burns. The lower elevation portions of the study area with more shrub cover burn at higher aggregate severity (Thode et al. 2011). Fires originating in these lower elevation forests have often been large (1987, 1990, and 1996), and the effect of vegetation type on fire severity distribution seems more important than the effect of fire area (details in Thode et al. 2011). The year with the greatest area burned (1996) had SM = 0.35. However, fire years 1987 and 1990, which had approximately half the area burned of 1996, featured equivalent or higher severity (SM = 0.38 and 0.35). These two years had very low levels of spring snowpack. All three of these fires burned in lower mixed conifer forest types, but the 1996 fire year featured higher area burned in closed canopy forest, and the 1987 and 1990 fire years burned in areas vegetated with mixed forest, woodland, and chaparral.|$|R

Contrary to findings in the savannas of Australia, there is no obvious increase in fire size or fire intensity from the early to the late fire season in southern Africa, presumably because patterns of fire ignition are very different.
