40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} whether occupational exposure to raw tobacco causes respiratory or allergic diseases, {{an excess of}} respiratory symptoms, a decrease in lung function, or parenchymal changes in chest radiography among Finnish cigar workers. METHODS: This cross sectional study included all Finnish cigar workers (n = 106) exposed to raw tobacco and also a group of unexposed matched referents. Data were collected with a self administered questionnaire, flow volume spirometry, measurements of diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, chest radiography and skin prick tests. A questionnaire was also sent to former workers of the factory. RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences}} between the groups in the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and chest radiography findings. Nine of 102 tobacco workers had pulmonary fibrosis of at least 1 / 0 (according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) 1980 classification) and the corresponding figure was five for the referents. The tobacco workers tended to have a low forced vital capacity (FVC), and they had impaired forced expiratory volume in 1 second and lower means of the maximal expiratory flow at 25 % of the FVC significantly more often than the referents. Diffusing capacity tended to be lower among the referents. The referents more often had atopy and earlier atopic diseases than the exposed workers. These results indicate the possibility of selection among the exposed workers. CONCLUSIONS: No excess of prevalence of respiratory symptoms in the tobacco workers was found. According to the questionnaire episodes of allergic alveolitis may have occurred in the cigar factory workers. However, in the absence of impairments in lung function and radiological changes it was not possible to distinguish humidifier fever and allergic alveolitis.

The engine model can be classified as a one-zone, zero-dimensional and includes sub-models for in-cylinder heat transfer, exhaust port heat transfer, heat release and the valve flow process. The turbocharger model is developed in steps {{and is based on}} a polynomial fit to experimental compressor and turbine performance data. Inlet and exhaust manifolds are treated as well-mixed volumes. A simplified model for the humidifier is adopted in order to simulate a humid air motor (HAM) concept. The whole engine system is zero dimensional and the different system components are linked by means of mean values for mass flow, temperatures, pressures and gas composition. The NASA-polynomials are used for calculating thermal and transport properties. The extended Zeldovich mechanism is used as an indicator of significant NO formation. The models are validated through comparisons with experiments on mainly diesel and HCCI engines, both cycle and system results. HCCI engine cycle simulations are made, showing the influence of various engine parameters e. g. compression ratio, engine speed, air-fuel ratio, exhaust gas recycling, inlet pressure and valve timing. Mainly natural gas and landfill gas are studied. The self-stabilizing feature of HCCI ignition timing is investigated using chemical kinetics.

40|$|The main aim of {{any kind}} of {{ventilation}} systems is to ensure optimal comfort conditions of indoor air quality for inhabitants independently of outdoor air parameters. Until the end of 90 -ties all dwelling buildings in Latvia were equipped with mandatory natural ventilation systems with stack effect. Nowadays in many cases there is only exhaust mechanical ventilation in dwellings but air tight windows prevent natural air intake. The operation of existing ventilation systems is inefficient and result in bad IAQ. Installation of regular mechanical “inflow - outflow” ventilation systems in dwelling buildings was limited by such factors as high noise level during operation time, limited buildings’ area and high construction expenses. In order to improve the situation in existing multi –flats buildings new technical decisions are being introduced. One of such decisions is use of hybrid ventilation. The implementation of principles of hybrid ventilation systems in Latvia poses some difficulties due to climatic conditions. In general Latvian climate can be described by moderate temperatures with all year round high relative humidity. In order to ensure optimal comfort parameters of indoor air it is necessary to use not only air heating devices but also <b>air</b> <b>humidifiers.</b> The paper deals with Latvian average climate parameters on the basis of statistical data for 10 year time period.

40|$|A micro-CHP system, {{rated at}} 5 kWel, {{based on a}} {{membrane}} reformer and a PEMFC is studied. The identification of the operative conditions of the PEMFC is crucial for a good integration with the membrane reformer: the hydrogen separated in the membrane reactor, after cooling, directly feeds the FC [1]. In principle, Pd-based membranes can produce high-purity hydrogen (target= 99. 99 %, i. e. selectivity= 104). However, the selectivity may decrease, in particular when thin Pd-membranes on ceramic support are adopted, and determine low-purity hydrogen (e. g. 99. 9 % with 100 ppm CO, i. e. selectivity= 102). A methanator is therefore added along the hydrogen cooling line to prevent CO-poisoning of the FC anodes. The quality of hydrogen affects the cell voltage and the overall system performances, therefore FC control strategies must be investigated. Build-up of inert and poisoning species in the hydrogen recirculation loop can be limited by venting {{a fraction of the}} anodic off-gas, whose amount can be optimized. Efficiency losses are estimated around one percentage point for each decrement of the order of magnitude of the selectivity. Deviations from the nominal operation occur during transients, at part-load or in case of faults of the Pd-membranes. These circumstances are investigated by simulating the FCs subsystem that includes the stack, the air and hydrogen blowers and the <b>air</b> <b>humidifier.</b> A dynamic, 1 D (along the channels) model of PEMFC has been developed to simulate mixed co/counter flow between anode and cathode streams, which characterize the flow field of large-surface cells. The poisoning effect of CO on Pt-Ru catalyst is also modeled [2]. An experimental campaign on an 8 -cells stack (cell area 220 cm 2) was performed to characterize the FC operation with reformate gas. The impact of fuel composition, containing up to 20 % of inert gases (N 2, CO 2, CH 4) and CO up to 40 ppm, and operative conditions (pressure and humidity) was analyzed on the overall stack performance {{as well as on the}} current density distribution along the cell surface.

40|$|This {{work has}} focused on the {{development}} of atmospheric freeze and non-freeze drying applying a heat pump system as an environmental friendly and economically preferable technology compare to vacuum freeze drying. The main reason of the research is a lack of knowledge and information in the literature about the atmospheric heat pump drying, while the more common vacuum freeze drying process is widely covered. The main objective for developing atmospheric heat pump drying as a new drying technology is the desire to reduce the energy consumption compared to that of vacuum freeze drying while maintaining a high product quality. One technical solution of atmospheric freeze and non-freeze drying is combining with a heat pump system applying a new environmentally friendly natural refrigerant, such as ammonia or R 717. Temperature programs make it possible to customize products for desired qualities and properties, such as color retention, instant rehydration and aroma preservation. Drying {{is one of the most}} important industrial processes, and a technology used worldwide for food processing. The vacuum freeze and high temperature drying are both well-known and extensively applied conventional technologies that have the drawback of high energy consumption. This provided the opportunity for heat pump drying development, in order to decrease operational costs while preserving the quality of the products. Heat pump drying is a relatively new technology developed at NTNU. It unifies the drying and heat pump cycles that allows energy recovery for reheating the drying air. An analysis was made on the technological aspects, product possibilities, physical properties of products, drying kinetics and modeling. This work covers the drying of green peas, applying a laboratory heat pump dryer. The drying conditions and processing time are the most important parameters for modeling and scalingup the process. Additionally, the temperature, relative humidity and residence time are essential for understanding changes in product properties, and fundamental for the designing and dimensioning of large-scale drying processes. Therefore, the various tests were done at many different temperature regimes, from - 5 °C to 45 °C, and at varying levels of relative humidity. Some of the drying tests applied additional equipment, such as an <b>air</b> <b>humidifier,</b> infrared lamps and an oven to get the specific temperature or moisture content of the tested product. All the drying tests were performed, and each run was done in a period of three hours using a fluidized bed mode. The results on kinetics and final moisture content indicated that temperatures and relative humidity levels lead to changes in the moisture removal rates from the material as well as the quality of the product. Studies were also made to investigate the influence of drying conditions and time on product parameters such as color and water activity. This work also proposes a numerical solution for the moisture content in order to describe the drying kinetics and effective mass diffusivity. The results in this work can be useful since it reduces the number of drying experiments to be tested at a wide range of drying conditions. The proposed models have been validated by experiments with acceptable deviations. It helps in establishing the temperature and time schedule in a preliminary study on scaling up lab dryers to a pilot or commercial drying plant. This is also a good platform for further research oriented towards the unification of available laboratory data in the heat pump drying of vegetables to the overall simulation program. The coefficient of performance (COP) and specific moisture extraction rate (SMER) were calculated to characterize the energy efficiency and water removal capacity of the heat pump drying process. Ammonia or R 717 was selected as the working fluid due to its thermal properties and for being an environmentally friendly refrigerant. Regarding greenhouse gases (GHGs), ammonia is a natural fluid which has zero ozone depletion potential (ODP) and zero global warming potential (GWP), that makes heat pump drying a competitive and efficient drying technology with a minimum impact on climate change.

40|$|The report {{comprises}} {{two separate}} parts: part 1 :  Temperature needs for district heating {{in the paint}} shop for axles in building 210 part 2 :  Energy and low temperature waste heat solutions in heating and cooling systems for   building 64 with surroundings The paint shop for axles in part 1 has air quality requirements in places for coating of axles. Toachieve desired air properties there are different process ventilation systems, which consist ofventilation coils for heating and cooling, plus <b>air</b> <b>humidifier.</b> The ventilations coils for heating usedistrict heating. Today the ventilation coils use water of 100 °C to achieve necessary air demands inthe coating boxes. This part of the report investigates whether the existing system would achievethe air requirements with a water temperature of 75 °C instead of 100 °C in the ventilation coilsduring the coldest parts of the year. The conclusion {{is that it is}} not possible; the existing system isadjusted for a water temperature of 100 °C to achieve the air requirements. To use a watertemperature of 75 °C, more or major ventilation coils are needed. The focus of the report is at part 2. In this part, possibilities for low temperature waste heatsolutions are investigated. Those partly aim at specific local solutions for building 64 withsurroundings and on the other part of general waste heat solutions for new buildings andreconstructions in the future. To make these parts possible, the systems for heating and cooling inbuilding 64 have been identified. During this identification, potential savings that are not of wasteheat character have also been observed. The most profitable saving concerns the control of temperature for the inner hardening vat. It isthe hardening vat for gas carburizing oven SV 16838 that has been studied in this report. Today thetemperature of the hardening vat is controlled very ineffective. The conclusion is that a betteradjustment of the controller would save 180 000 SEK/year with a pay off time around two months. Worth mentioning (SV 16838 included), is that there are at least five similar gas carburizing ovens atthe Scania area in Södertälje. A pinch analysis has also been done for building 64, with it’s primarily conclusion that the groundheating is violating the pinch rules during long periods of the year. To remedy the ground heatingwill only need a different control and will lead to a saving between 20 000 – 75 000 SEK/year. Tomore accurate determine the saving, an investigation of the ground heating during winter time isneeded. Another conclusion concerning the pinch analysis is that the method for a real scenariorather shows the potential of the system than gives you an optimal solution possible to implement. More actions are to use the exhaustions of the endo gas generators and that the washing andrinsing systems if possible not should be heated with electricity. The exhaustions from the endo gasgenerators have a very high temperature, more then 300 °C. If these, instead of hot water boilers,could warm the closely located water for the LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) evaporation, 125 000 SEK/year can be saved. Today the hot water boilers are heated with electricity. If the washing andrinsing systems existing electricity heating instead can be heated with secondary heat (˜ districtheating), a save of 500 000 SEK/year is possible. For waste heat solutions there are a few different approaches. Close to building 64, the largestpotential to use waste heat is in building 62 and 75, where air heaters are assessed with the largestpotential. In difference to other investigated buildings, building 210 has the possibility to use wasteheat even during the summer. This building is located 1 km from building 64. To use waste water inbuilding 210, a complex net of waste heating will be required where several buildings with asurplus of waste heat can be connected. A net like this has calculated pipe costs of 5, 2 million SEK. The saving for the use of waste heat only in building 210 will be around 1, 4 million SEK/year.

METHODS [...] Symptoms from 88 factory workers were surveyed by a doctor administered questionnaire and compared with their serum IgG antibody titres to humidifier water contaminants quantified by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS [...] The strength of association between individual symptoms and antibody showed that fever, shivering or chills, influenza-like symptoms, or headache were individually significantly associated with the presence and higher titres of antibody. This was also true for those subjects whose symptoms were most pronounced during {{the first day of}} the working week. Within each subject's full symptom profile there were significant associations between the description of chest tightness, breathlessness, and wheeze; between headache and influenza like symptoms; between fever and shivering or chills; and between intermittent onset and general tiredness. Discriminant analysis of the full symptom profiles showed that there was maximum information content in five independent parameters, namely, the descriptions of fever, headache, and chest tightness, the timing of their onset, and the readiness to describe miscellaneous symptoms in addition to those in the questionnaire. On the basis of these criteria 72 % of subjects could be classified according to their antibody state. Cluster analysis with these five independent parameters described four symptom clusters: one associated with high median antibody levels, one with low, and two with zero median levels. These were, respectively: (1) fever with headache and chest tightness; (2) either no or few symptoms; (3) chest tightness and headache with intermittent onset; (4) headache and miscellaneous symptoms with intermittent onset. CONCLUSIONS [...] The association between serum antibody titres and specific symptom patterns may identify different categories of disease which constitute the spectrum known as humidifier related disease, and strengthens the hypothesis that antibody may be involved in the pathogenesis of some components of the disease...|$|R

40|$|A {{steady state}} model of {{co-current}} spray evaporator and <b>air</b> (de) <b>humidifier</b> for non-isothermal droplets {{has been developed}} to investigate the effect of polydispersity of droplet size on performance. The model is validated by comparison with results of Dickinson and Marshall (1968, AICHE J. 14, 541). It reveals that their ideal assumption of constant droplet temperature leads to significant error when the droplet size distribution is strongly polydisperse. Numerous simulation cases of the spray evaporator show that the average droplet diameter and droplet size distribution of water spray significantly affect {{the change in the}} air properties and the size, velocity and temperature of water droplets. For polydisperse droplets, a narrower droplet size distribution (# = 0. 2) shows a more rapid decrease in the diameter of the droplets, thus causing a more rapid temperature decrease and humidity increase of the air than the case of a broader droplet size distribution (# = 0. 4) with the same volume-averaged diameter.

This paper {{presents}} the oxygen stoichiometry control problem of proton exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells and introduces a solution through an optimal control methodology. Based {{on the study}} of a non-linear dynamical model of a laboratory PEM fuel cell system and its associated components (<b>air</b> compressor, <b>humidifiers,</b> line heaters, valves, etc.), a control strategy for the oxygen stoichiometry regulation in the cathode line is designed and tested. From a linearized model of the system, an LQR/LQG controller is designed to give a solution to the stated control problem. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed controllers design.

5000|$|Water {{filtration}}: First seen commercially in the 1920s in {{the form}} of the Newcombe Separator (later to become the Rexair Rainbow), a water filtration vacuum cleaner uses a water bath as a filter. It forces the dirt-laden intake air to pass through water before it is exhausted, so that wet dust cannot become airborne. The water trap filtration and low speed may also allow the user to use the machine as a stand-alone <b>air</b> purifier and <b>humidifier</b> unit. The dirty water must be dumped out and the appliance must be cleaned after each use, to avoid growth of bacteria and mold, causing unpleasant odors.|$|R

The most important characteristic of the equipment is to be “friend of the environment”, {{in the sense that}} it does not use environmentally aggressive refrigerating fluids. Other main characteristic is associated with the complexity of its control, due to the large number of input and output variables and the necessity to maintain several concurrent processes, ranging from the processes associated with equipment security to processes associated with normal functions, as heating and cooling, including processes associated with the cleaning of the <b>air,</b> using <b>humidifiers.</b> For the system development, Microsoft Visual C++ was used as code integration platform, enabling merging of results obtained from LabWindows/CVI for virtual instrumentation and generation the application synoptic, with other results obtained from Statemate Magnum (used as a Statecharts based development system). The used control methods rely on Statechart models (which are adequate for modelling of systems controlled by discrete events) using continuous variables associated to some states of the system (needed for some actuators of the equipment). The simulation and validation of the model were major tasks that were taken prior to the implementation of the system.

5000|$|Bypass {{flow-through}} style (bypass - {{also known}} as [...] "biscuit style" [...] or many other, similar variant names) uses a pipe to bring water directly to an electrically controlled valve {{at the top of}} the <b>humidifier.</b> <b>Air</b> passes through an aluminum [...] "biscuit" [...] (often called a pad; the term [...] "biscuit" [...] emphasizes the solid rather than foamy form) which is similar to a piece of extremely coarse steel wool. The biscuit has a coating of a matte ceramic, resulting in an extremely large surface area within a small space. When the hygrostat calls for humidity, the valve is opened and causes a spray of water onto the biscuit. Hot air is passed through the biscuit, causing the water to evaporate from the pad and be carried into the building.|$|R

In this study, a system of proton exchange membrane fuel cell has been modeled to analyze {{the performance of the}} fuel cell system for automotive application. The model is composed of the fuel cell stack, <b>air</b> compressor, <b>humidifier,</b> and intercooler, and hydrogen supply which are implemented by using the Matlab/SimulinkⓇ. Fuel cell stack model is empirical model but the water transport model is included so that the system performance can be predicted over various humidity conditions. On the other hand, the model of air compressor is composed of motor, static air compressor, and some manifolds so that the motor dynamics and manifold dynamics can be investigated. Since the model is concentrated on the strategic operation of compressor to reduce the power consumption, other balance of components (BOP) are modeled to be static components. Since the air compressor model is empirical model which is based on curve fitting of experiments, the stack model is validated with the commercial software and the experiments. The dynamics of air compressor is investigated over unit change of system load. The results shows that the power consumption of air compressor is about 12 % to 25 % of stack gross power and dynamic response should be reduced to optimize the system operation...|$|R
