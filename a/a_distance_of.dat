50|$|Humour {{can serve}} as <b>a</b> strong <b>distancing</b> {{mechanism}} in coping with adversity. In 1997 Kelter and Bonanno found that Duchenne laughter correlated with reduced awareness of distress. Positive emotion is able to loosen the grip of negative emotions on peoples’ thinking. <b>A</b> <b>distancing</b> <b>of</b> thought leads to <b>a</b> <b>distancing</b> <b>of</b> the unilateral responses people often have to negative arousal. In parallel with the distancing role plays in coping with distress, it supports the broaden and build theory that positive emotions lead to increased multilateral cognitive pathway and social resource building.|$|R

5|$|HD 154672 b is {{a closely}} {{orbiting}} planet that {{is larger than}} Jupiter. Its mass was estimated as 5.02 that of Jupiter. HD 154672 b also orbits its host star at <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> 0.6 AU every 163.91 days. Earth, in comparison, orbits the Sun at <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> 1 AU every 365.25 days. However, HD 154672 b has an orbital eccentricity of 0.61, which indicates a very elliptical orbit. Because HD 154672 b has such an eccentric orbit, the equilibrium temperature of the planet varies between 300 K and 600 K, which is significantly {{higher than that of}} Jupiter (124 K). If liquid water is present in the atmosphere of HD 154672 b, it could possibly convert between gaseous and liquid phases as the planet moves along its orbit.|$|E
