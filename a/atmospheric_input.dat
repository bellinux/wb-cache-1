40|$|The {{objective}} of this deliverable is to review and report the available models for studying the coupling of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>inputs</b> of persistent organic pollutants and their accumulation in planktonic food webs. <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>inputs</b> {{are known to be}} the main input of pollutants to open sea marine environments and also be important in coastal environments. The modelling of these interactions is important because <b>atmospheric</b> <b>inputs</b> are very dynamic and variable with time and can induce temporally high concentrations in the water column. Therefore, the models needed for studying these interactions should be dynamic (not at equilibrium or steady state) {{in order to be able}} to be able to predict the high observed environmental variability, and thus able to predict episodes were potential threshold values are obtained. Furthermore, these models should also be able to take into account the interactions between fate and impact of pollutants and trophic status, which allows studying together the two drivers considered within the Thresholds IP (nutrients and pollutants). The models reviewed here are those of the three main atmospheric deposition processes; namely dry aerosol deposition, wet deposition and diffusive exchanges. Furthermore the current knowledge of the accumulation processes and cycling of organic pollutants in phytoplankton is reviewed. There are few reports of the quantification and parameterization of accumulation and cycling of POPs in bacteria and zooplankton. Here, novel results obtained for zooplankton within the threshold IP are presented which suggest an important role of these in POP cycling. It is identified that more research is needed on the role of bacteria in the impact of POPs in aquatic food webs. One of the issues that previous models were not able to assess is the relative importance of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>inputs</b> and inputs from sediments of POPs in food webs. Sediments are known to be a source of pollutants for benthic food webs, but their influence is not clear in the pelagic zone. The 1 D model developed within Thresholds allows to elucidate the relative importance of these two sources of pollutants for the first time. It is shown that the atmosphere is the main contributor for the most part of the water column, except for very shallow ecosystems. Furthermore, some of the interactions between trophic status and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>inputs</b> as provided by models are also reviewed here. The present review will allow in the next future to couple these models with toxicity models including the concepts of thresholds in order to identify whether points of no return and thresholds do happen in ecosystems due to pollutants as a driver.

That benchmark effort led to a scientific publication in Global Biogeochemical Cycles (Duce, Liss et al., 1991) that for more than 10 years was the stateoftheart reference in this area, leading to over 500 citations in the literature.

Until recently, rivers {{were thought to be}} the most important nitrogen source but we now know that <b>atmospheric</b> <b>inputs</b> are large and can equal, or exceed, those from the rivers. These atmospheric nitrogen compounds have both agricultural sources (ammonia emitted from animal wastes) and combustion sources (nitrate derived from NOx emitted by vehicles and power stations). Our hypothesis is that atmospheric nitrogen deposition in summer to nutrient depleted, well lit, surface waters in coastal seas stimulates phytoplankton blooms. This paper summarises and compares studies conducted in the North Sea, the North East Atlantic Ocean and the Kattegat Sea. Budgeting approaches imply that the atmosphere can, under certain meteorological conditions and over short time periods, provide enough nitrogen to support a large increase in phytoplankton growth. This is not true in all areas and at all times and this emphasises the highly episodic nature of atmospheric deposition. However, productivity-based approaches suggest that <b>atmospheric</b> nitrogen <b>inputs</b> have little effect on phytoplankton growth. This may be because productivity in the North Sea and the Kattegat is controlled by internal recycling of nitrogen, even in the summer when inorganic nitrogen levels are very low. Over longer time scales, <b>atmospheric</b> <b>inputs</b> do increase the overall nitrogen stock in the water column. Reducing the input of nitrogen from the atmosphere will, therefore, reduce total nitrogen loads to coastal seas and hence may decrease eutrophication problems...|$|R

Shipboard aerosol samples indicate fractional solubility values of 8 – 100 % for aerosol Co, which are significantly higher than corresponding estimates of the solubility of aerosol Fe (0. 44 – 45 %). Hydrographic observations and analysis of time series rain samples from Bermuda indicate that wet deposition accounts for most (> 80 %) of the total aeolian flux of Co, and hence a significant proportion of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>input</b> of dCo to our study region. Our aerosol data imply that the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>input</b> of dCo to the Sargasso Sea is modest, although this flux may be more significant in late summer.

The effects of biological removal of dCo from the upper water column were apparent as pronounced sub-surface minima (21 ± 4 pM dCo), coincident with maxima in Prochlorococcus abundance. These observations imply that Prochlorococcus {{plays a major role in}} removing dCo from the euphotic zone, and that the availability of dCo may regulate Prochlorococcus growth in the Sargasso Sea...|$|E
40|$|The {{trace metals}} {{aluminum}} (Al) and manganese (Mn) were {{studied in the}} Weddell Sea in March 2008. Concentrations of dissolved Al ([Al]) were slightly elevated (0. 23 – 0. 35 nmol L− 1) in the surface layer compared to the subsurface minimum (0. 07 – 0. 21 nmol L− 1) observed in the winter water. Atmospheric deposition is {{the main source of}} Al to the central Weddell Sea (22 µmol m− 2 yr− 1), and the residence time of dissolved Al in the upper mixed layer is ~ 0. 8 yr. The flux from the shelf and slope regions equals about 50 % of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>input</b> of Al to the western Weddell Sea. The highest [Al] in the Weddell Sea bottom water (WSBW) is related to the formation of deep water, and the associated downward flux is in the range of 3 – 10 µmol Al m− 2 yr− 1. The concentrations of dissolved Mn ([Mn]) were depleted in the surface layer, likely as a result of biological uptake, as indicated by the correlation among Mn, major nutrients, and fluorescence. The significant negative relation between the ΔMn : ΔP ratio and the ambient concentration of dissolved iron indicates iron-Mn co-limitation. The flux of Mn from the continental margin is about 2. 2 times greater than <b>atmospheric</b> <b>input</b> (1. 1 µmol m− 2 yr− 1). The flux of both Al and Mn from the continental margin indicates melting of continental ice (icebergs) or direct continental runoff. The slightly elevated [Mn] in the WSBW is due to a relatively small flux of 1 µmol Mn m− 2 yr− 1 associated with WSBW formation. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of Cr (III) and Cr (VI) were determined {{in the upper}} 500 m of the Sargasso Sea {{at different times of}} the year. Total Cr concentrations ranged between 2. 5 and 4. 5 nM, and the predominant species of Cr was the thermodynamically favoured Cr (VI). Cr (III) concentrations were greatest during periods of high biological activity, as indicated by strong correlations between the ratio of Cr (III) :Cr (VI) and both bacterial biomass and primary productivity. Whilst the oxidation state varied substantially over the seasonal cycle, the upper water column inventory of Cr was relatively constant. The long residence time of Cr in the surface Sargasso Sea estimated with respect to <b>atmospheric</b> <b>inputs</b> (1410 – 2240 years) is indicative of the largely conservative behaviour of this element. Deep particle fluxes of Cr are similar or somewhat greater than <b>atmospheric</b> <b>inputs,</b> and this downward flux of Cr is well correlated with organic carbon fluxes from the upper Sargasso Sea. The long residence time coupled with the seasonal changes in oxidation state of Cr implies rapid seasonal recycling of Cr between redox states, with only slow removal via particles to the deep ocean at this site. <br/...|$|R
