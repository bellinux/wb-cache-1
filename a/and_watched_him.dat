500|$|Prior to the album's release, Manson made {{a series}} of disparaging {{comments}} regarding Interscope and its artistic censorship; as well as its then-CEO Jimmy Iovine, who Manson said [...] "wasn't smart enough to understand what [...] do." [...] He also accused the label of caring more about Vitamin Water [...] than music. Several days after the album's release, Trent Reznor – who, as of 2015, remains friends and business partners with Iovine – called Manson a [...] "dopey clown", and said that [...] "He is a malicious guy and will step on anybodies face to succeed and cross any line of decency." [...] Manson responded by accusing Reznor of professional jealousy, saying: [...] "Since I've known Trent, he's always let his jealousy and bitterness for other people get in the way. I'm not talking about me—I sat back <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> be jealous of Kurt Cobain and Billy Corgan {{and a lot of other}} musicians in the past. I just don't find time to do that. I stopped thinking about him a while back." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 1963, Waters and Mason {{moved into}} a flat at 39 Stanhope Gardens near Crouch End in London, owned by Mike Leonard, a {{part-time}} tutor at the nearby Hornsey College of Art and the Regent Street Polytechnic. Mason moved out after the 1964 academic year, and guitarist Bob Klose moved in during September 1964, prompting Waters' switch to bass. Sigma6 went through several names, including the Meggadeaths, the Abdabs and the Screaming Abdabs, Leonard's Lodgers, and the Spectrum Five, before settling on the Tea Set. In 1964, as Metcalfe and Noble left to form their own band, guitarist Syd Barrett joined Klose and Waters at Stanhope Gardens. Barrett, two years younger, had moved to London in 1962 to study at the Camberwell College of Arts. Waters and Barrett were childhood friends; Waters had often visited Barrett <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> play guitar at Barrett's mother's house. Mason said about Barrett: [...] "In a period when everyone was being cool in a very adolescent, self-conscious way, Syd was unfashionably outgoing; my enduring memory of our first encounter {{is the fact that}} he bothered to come up and introduce himself to me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many {{travelers}} {{described what}} they saw during the attack to reporters. One man stated, [...] "We came right to international departures and saw the man randomly shooting. He was just firing at anyone coming in front of him. He was wearing all black. His face was not masked. I was 50 meters away from him." [...] He continued, [...] "We ducked behind a ticket counter but I stood up <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him.</b> Two explosions went off shortly after one another. By that time he had stopped shooting." [...] Lastly he said [...] "He turned around and started coming towards us. He was holding his gun inside his jacket. He looked around anxiously {{to see if anyone}} was going to stop him and then went down the escalator ... We heard some more gunfire and then another explosion, and then it was over." ...|$|E
