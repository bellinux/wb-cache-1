While the threat sensitive behaviour in Trinidadian guppies has received considerable attention, the influence of reproductive assets on threat sensitive response patterns has received little attention. This study compares anti- predator behaviour in gravid (high <b>accrued</b> <b>assets)</b> vs. non-gravid (low <b>accrued</b> <b>assets)</b> guppies from both high and low predation risk populations. A significant difference in anti-predator response was found between gravid and non-gravid guppies in the Lower Aripo population (high predation site); gravid guppies exhibited a stronger overall anti-predator response to the same level of ambient predation threat, whilst non-gravid guppies showed weaker responses. However, in the Upper Aripo population (low predation site), a similar response was found in gravid and non-gravid guppies. The greater anti-predator response observed by gravid guppies in the Lower Aripo population supports the hypothesis that accrued reproductive assets influence threat sensitive response in Trinidadian guppies. Furthermore, the difference in response observed between the Lower and Upper Aripo guppy populations suggests iii that long-term predation {{plays an important role in}} shaping anti-predator responses to predation risk.

40|$|With {{growing public}} {{debate over the}} {{increased}} foreign ownership of farm land, this paper concludes that the overall impact on {{the economy has been}} positive. Introduction: Global investment in agriculture has attracted attention from politicians, analysts, security experts and think-tanks. There is a growing public debate over the potential implications for food security through increased foreign ownership of farm land. The propensity of foreign investors—particularly sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) —to <b>accrue</b> productive agricultural <b>assets</b> has increased. Australia, as an open and medium-sized economy with a robust policy environment and strong agricultural sector, has attracted increased foreign investment flows. This paper provides context for these debates. It concludes that the overall impact on the economy has been positive, notwithstanding the ongoing public concerns in this area. Part 1 of the paper sets out the extent of foreign investment in the agricultural sector and places {{it in the context of}} foreign investment in the wider economy. In particular, this part shows the major source countries for investment as well as the developing trends. Part 2 outlines the regulatory framework by which Australia governs FDI. Interestingly, and perhaps contrary to general public perceptions, the analysis suggests that Australia has one of the more restrictive regulatory regimes among our OECD counterparts. Part 3 then examines the various aspects of the public debate in Australia over FDI in the agricultural sector: both the arguments for the economic benefits of FDI to Australia, as well as the basis for the underlying public unease over foreign ownership of Australian farms. In Part 4, the analysis concludes with a review of the principal policy options being discussed, including refining the national interest test, altering the review threshold, and improving the information available to the public...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} three essays that examine, using explicitly monetary general equilibrium models, {{the effects}} of inflation on the transacting patterns adopted by optimizing agents and the macroeconomic consequences of inflation-induced changes in these patterns. In particular, these essays study the implications of such inflation-induced changes in individual behavior for the structure of demands and prices that characterize the steady state equilibrium of an economy. In doing so they help provide {{a better understanding of}} the co-movements between inflation and relative prices found to characterize the economic data of several countries.;The first essay studies {{the effects of}} inflation-induced changes in transacting patterns on the relative prices of durable and nondurable commodities. Using a two-good general equilibrium Baumol-Tobin model, here it is shown how, given the role played by money in mediating economic exchanges, changes in inflation alter the effective costs of purchasing and consuming durables and nondurables, leading thereby to changes in the demands for them and hence to changes in their relative prices.;The second essay extends the Baumol-Tobin framework used above to allow for an endogenous determination of the real rate of interest paid out on bonds/bank deposits. The analysis conducted here serves, on the one hand, to provide an explanation for the empirically observed co-movements between inflation and real interest rates prevailing in an economy. In addition, it allows an examination of the robustness of the relative price propositions derived earlier to the constant real interest rate specification assumed there.;The third essay examines the effects of inflation on the relative prices of physical assets, such as durable goods, and financial assets, such as equities, using a simple representative-agent cash-constrained framework. Here it is shown how, in a monetary economy, given a particular difference in the way in which returns on these <b>assets</b> <b>accrue</b> to their holders, changes in inflation alter the real values of the returns they yield, leading thereby to changes in the demands for them and hence to changes in their relative prices...|$|R
40|$|Asia 2 ̆ 7 s general {{reliance}} on {{defined benefit schemes}} could potentially lead to unfunded liabilities similar to those experienced in some countries in Europe, once the tipping point is reached. Some {{segments of the population}} lack meaningful pensions, a feature of many developing economies in the region, which means the whole system of retirement income in Asia needs urgent attention. Summary•	This is the second research brief in a three-part series that looks at Asia in the ageing century, with a particular focus on the countries of East and South-East Asia. •	The context is outlined in the first brief, which describes population, urbanisation and social trends in the region. Specifically, it notes that population ageing in East and South-East Asia is happening faster and at a lower level of economic development than in the West. Many Asian countries now have a decade or so to prepare for the later stages of demographic transition. •	With the challenges set out, we turn to responses and opportunities. In this regard, Parts II and III of the series focus on two areas of economic activity which are both pertinent and have enormous scale: providing retirement income (covered in the present brief) and healthcare (outlined in Part III). Getting these right could result in favourable macro-economic rebalancing of growth in the region – where individuals can pool risks and reduce the need for excessive precautionary savings. •	As in Europe, Asia’s {{reliance on}} defined benefit schemes may result in unfunded liabilities when the ratio of pension recipients to contributors increases, unless sustainability features are built in. China’s generous urban workers’ scheme is only affordable because it is not yet mature or widespread. And poorly designed access arrangements can result in excessive costs and disincentives to work that waste the potential of healthy older people. For example, pension access ages are low in East and South-East Asian countries: on average 59 for men and 57 for women. •	Alongside issues of sustainability, adequacy of pension benefits remains important. Many Asians have no pension entitlements. This is not surprising given the region’s economic development, but if demographic and social development is considered, the situation demands more urgent action. Adequacy also depends on ensuring regular retirement income, which is unlikely in the absence of preservation and annuities. •	There are also private sector opportunities, including providing financial services to help Asian workers transition into retirement as has happened with <b>assets</b> <b>accrued</b> by baby boomers in the West. The size of pension assets already offers opportunities, but there are varying strategies for foreign entrants to choose from with different levels of capital investment – from opening local branches to building long-term links. •	Lastly, a viable private pension sector requires the right set of preconditions. Here, experts from countries such as Japan and Australia have an opportunity to contribute to developing the region’s pension and insurance infrastructure. Both countries have experience in population ageing research and policy implementation.  ...|$|R
40|$|The {{ownership}} of agricultural land by foreign nationals is currently an extremely sensitive political issue {{in many of}} the Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries as they move towards European Union accession. During the past decade economic reforms in CEE have resulted in substantial welfare declines within agricultural sectors across the region. Generally, all agents within the agri-food chain have faced similar problems of decreasing terms of trade, increased competition, lack of financial resources and thin markets for both the sale of their output {{as well as for the}} sale of their underlying assets if so inclined (Swinnen and Macours, 2000). As a result, farmers have found themselves in severe financial distress and forced to operate at subsistence levels that are well below the optimal productive capacity levels that would be expected under normal equilibrium market conditions without these constraints (Swinnen and Gow, 1999). Consequently, most farmers have been unable to purchase agricultural land at its long-term economic equilibrium value. Instead they have either leased land short-term or have offered their own land holdings at substantially undervalued prices. Recognizing that all farmers are similarly distressed, lack suitable repayment capacity, and land provides minimal security due to being under-valued, banks have been unwilling to provide farmers with mortgage loans. Consequently, very little land is being sold as absentee landowners have also recognized the market is undervaluing their assets, instead preferring to hold on them until land prices correct themselves. However, a reasonably fluid land leasing market has developed in a number of countries. In Hungary, for example, the land leasing market along EU border countries is being driven by foreigners who have found potential loopholes in the laws and been able to develop innovative organizational and contractual structures to control these land assets, which have been coined pocket contracts. Shleifer and Vishney, 1992, developed a general equilibrium model analyzing the impact of asset illiquidity under idiosyncratic shocks. The model shows that if individuals are not financially distressed and the economy is in equilibrium then the value of an asset (i. e. land) should equal the present value of future earnings that <b>accrue</b> to that <b>asset</b> when operated in its best use. However, if the economy is hit by an idiosyncratic shock and all agents are financial distressed, assets will be substantially undervalued, unless outsiders are allowed to participate in the market. As a result, the subject of allowing outsiders (i. e. foreigners) to participate in agricultural land markets has become increasingly relevant as many CEE countries exclude foreigners from purchasing agricultural land. Additionally, EU treaty amendments directly address the prohibition of Member States to 'limit land acquisition by nationals of other Member States' (Hodgson, 1999). The policy and welfare implications and sensitivities are substantial, however they have only received passing attention in academic and policy literature. The objective of this paper is to extend the Shleifer and Vishney (1992) model to help explain and understand the economic impact and implications that the exclusion of foreign ownership is having on 1) the economic value of agricultural land and 2) economic welfare of current and potential landowners and users in the CEE countries. The case of Hungarian land reform will provide empirical evidence to highlight the consequences of the exclusion of foreigners in land markets. Policy implications will be provided for a series of different land reform scenarios. Land Economics/Use,...|$|R
40|$|The {{advancement}} of technology greatly increased {{the demand for}} money. Vast monetization as well as ever-rising demand for money necessitated the use of credit instruments. Under the western economic system credit inevitably entailed fixed rate of return {{for the use of}} borrowed money. So long as the European empires dominated over the states where Muslims had lost their sovereignty, the conventional economic system continued to prevail. However, the resurgence of Islamic thought inspired the Muslims to reorganize their financial system. The injunction on â€œRibaâ€� in Islam re-awakened the Muslims. The commencement of Islamic finance movement paved the way for transforming the conventional system of economics into an Islamic one which could ensure an exploitation free financial system. The efforts ultimately fructified. First, the establishment of The Islamic Development Bank in 1975 and then the formation of Oar-ul-Mall AI-Islami in 1981 inspired the Muslims to adopt their own system of finance, which ensures â€œRibaâ€� free transaction. Like all other Muslim countries Pakistan also embarked upon the scheme of Islamisation in 1979 and introduced several non-interest based financial instruments. In the process of change many critics observed that the instruments employed in Pakistan did not meet the criteria postulated by jurists on Islamic Fiqah. With a view to analysing and finding out the nature, scope and implications of each instrument, this study was undertaken to suggest practical alternative to the prevailing interest-based financial instruments. While analysing Pakistan's experiences in introducing Non-Interest modes of financing, it was observed that the instruments which conformed to Islamic Sharia like Musharika could not be continued with because of uncertainty of profit rate and also manipulation of accounts by the partner companies which often resulted in lower rate of return. Therefore, the Non-Interest modes applied in banking could not command public acceptability. Financing on the basis of â€œMark upâ€� was therefore, adopted mostly for providing working capital requirements of business & industry. Under this mode notional transaction of sale/purchase of goods formed the basis which can not get authenticity from the law of Sharia In order to make a detailed study for identifying the complexities involved and implications of each financial instrument like Musharika, Modaraba, Ijara, Bai Muajjal, Bai Salam etc the original works of renowned jurists {{as well as that of}} modern scholars have been consulted. Finally the following conclusions have been drawn with regard to the Non-Interest Based Modes employed in Pakistan: 1. The mode of modaraba was implemented by Modaraba companies instead of individual modaribs. The activities of modaraba companies remained restricted, mostly, to stock trading instead of distribution process. 2. The instrument of musharika did not receive much acceptability because of the attitude of the risk averters on the one hand and the availability of alternate modes of financing on the other. 3. Arbitrary weightage to bank's investment under rent sharing mode has no legitimacy as it awards undue edge to bank's investment to the detriment of partner customer. 4. The buy-back agreement transactions remained confined to stock and other marketable securities which restricted its scope as well as utility. The transactions entered into with regard to real estate and other fixed assets did not prove the criteria under the law of Sharia because neither the possession changed nor benefits <b>accruing</b> from the <b>assets</b> were derived by the buyers i. e. financing bank. 5. Both the modes of hire-purchase and leasing are settled at a predetermined rate of rent instead of working out actual net rent on case to case basis. Again, the activities of leasing companies relating to loan advancing on the basis of markup do not find approval under the law of Islamic Sharia. 6. Bill discounting procedure under the new modes in no way differs from the bill purchase under the conventional system. By renaming â€œInterestâ€� into â€œMark Downâ€� does not legitimise the transaction under the law of Sharia. Similarly financing on the basis of â€œMark Upâ€� under the garb of sale-purchase transaction can not derive approval from the Islamic jurisprudence. The financing under sale/purchase of goods on the basis of â€œMark Upâ€� on deferred payment basis is a notional transaction and carries interest in disguise. Suggestions have, therefore, been made wherever felt feasible keeping in view the socio-economic viability of each instrument. At the end an â€œAlternativeâ€� to present â€œMark-Upâ€� based mode has been suggested which will operate without involving the element of interest. Under these â€œAlternativeâ€�, a banker will, after having satisfied himself about the credit worthiness of the customer and security offered, sanction a finance limit of a certain amount for a pal 1 icular customer. Therefore, the customer will be allowed to purchase Traderâ€™s Credit Cheques against the already approved limit. These Trader's Credit Cheques will be encashable at all branches of the issuing bank. The customer will pay a commission/fee at the time of purchase of T. C. C. of required denomination. On presentment of the T. C. C. the issuing bank will make payment to the debit of customerâ€™s account. The customer will adjust his liabilities within 90 days for which period, the customer will not pay any charges. However, in case of his failure to liquidate the liability within 90 days, he will be issued monthly notice for adjustment of account and incase of his failure to positively respond the bank or finance giving agency will exercise the right against securities as envisaged in banks finances recoveries ordinance 2001. The instrument will provide the customer a finance facility without involving the element of interest. The operational mechanism has already been elaborated in Part-III...|$|R
40|$|A presente dissertação efetua uma revisão de {{literatura}} sobre a manipulação de resultados nas empresas portuguesas não cotadas, que consequentemente afeta a qualidade de informação das suas demonstrações financeiras. O fenómeno de manipulação de resultados é complexo e de difícil deteção, o que torna este tema controverso e de análise relevante, principalmente para os leitores das demonstrações financeiras. As razões porque os indivíduos cometem fraude ou manipulam as demonstrações financeiras podem ser várias. Para tentar explicar este acontecimento Donald Cressey criou o chamado “Triângulo da Fraude”. Em que o primeiro vértice contempla a necessidade financeira sentida pelo indivíduo, caracterizada pela pressão própria sentida quer por necessidade de liquidez financeira quer por integração num grupo social cujo somatório entre as possíveis perdas e ganhos e a justificação para os seus atos (racionalização) o leva a decidir pela prática ou não de atos fraudulentos. Neste triângulo também se encontra considerada a oportunidade que pode ser caracterizada através de falhas do controlo interno. Desta forma, esta dissertação pretende averiguar de acordo com diferentes graus de rentabilidade as empresas que tendem mais a manipular os seus resultados, tendo em conta os diferentes objetivos destas empresas e dos seus gestores. De entre vários métodos de deteção de manipulação de resultados foi escolhido o que se aplica melhor a análise em questão, sendo que alguns deles são de difícil aplicação para grande nº de empresas e contextos diferentes. O modelo utilizado, elaborado por Francis (2004), parte de outros modelos já criados para estabelecer uma ligação entre sete atributos, entre os quais a qualidade dos accruals, para verificar a qualidade de informação das demonstrações financeiras e o impacto que tem nas decisões dos investidores. Através de um modelo econométrico que vamos utilizar para calcular a qualidade dos accruals na nossa amostra, este chega a conclusões sobre as influências dos atributos como iremos explicar de seguida. As empresas que têm uma melhor rentabilidade têm assim um incentivo maior de fuga aos impostos enquanto, as empresas que apresentam uma rentabilidade mais reduzida necessitam de maior financiamento e desse modo vão ter um conflito de incentivos quando chega a hora de tomar decisões. Isto porque, estas precisam de apresentar melhores resultados para obterem melhores taxas de financiamento mas ao mesmo tempo querem pagar menos imposto. Daqui pode-se esperar que as empresas manipulem mais quando têm uma rentabilidade mais elevada, de forma a reduzirem o valor a entregar ao Estado. Através da análise das regressões concluímos que as empresas que têm mais tendência a manipular são as que têm rentabilidades mais elevadas e mais reduzidas de acordo com o esperado. This thesis makes {{a literature}} review {{on the results}} of manipulation in unlisted Portuguese companies, which consequently affects the quality of information in its financial statements. The phenomenon of earning management is complex and difficult detection, which makes this controversial and relevant analysis theme, especially for readers of the financial statements. Within the earning management definition exists manipulation of actual transactions and handling of accrued expenses and revenues. The results consist of cash flows and accruals of expenses and revenues, and the handling of each of these components will affect the results. A manager can make operational decisions with an impact on financial numbers - cash flows, such as offering products with high discounts in {{the end of the year}} in order to anticipate sales to reach a goal or cut spending on research and development. The second form of managers achieve the desired results is to handle the increases in spending and revenues. In this method, the company does not change its activity, but rather opportunistically recorded profit of its existing activities. Examples that increase the results are the reduction of provisions, capitalize expenses and avoid depreciation of <b>assets.</b> <b>Accrued</b> expenses and revenues create the opportunity to manipulate results because there is a need for estimates, forecasts and judgments. This type of manipulation is derived from selective interpretation of accounting rules, since the company is free to choose between the existing methods in the standards. The reasons why individuals commit fraud can be several. To try to explain this event Donald Cressey created the so-called "Triangle of Fraud. " In the first vertex includes financial need felt by the individual, characterized by felt own pressure or by need for financial liquidity either by integration into a social group whose sum of the possible gains and losses and the justification for their acts (rationalization) takes to decide to practice or not fraudulent acts. In this triangle is also considered that the opportunity may be characterized by internal control failures. Thus, this dissertation seeks to ascertain according to different degrees of profitability companies that are more likely to manipulate the results, taking into account the different objectives of these companies and their managers. Among several match-fixing detection methods was chosen that best applies the analysis in question, some of which are difficult to apply to large number of companies and different contexts. The model developed by Francis, La Fond, Olsson, Schipper 2004 from other models already created to establish a link between seven attributes, including the quality of accruals and deferrals, to check the quality of information in the financial statements and the impact it has on investor’s decisions. Through an econometric model that we use to calculate the quality of accruals and deferrals in our sample, this draws conclusions about the influence of the attributes as we explain below. Companies that have a better profitability thus have a greater incentive for tax evasion while, companies that have a lower profitability require increased funding and thus will have an incentive conflict when it comes time to make decisions. This is because they need to deliver better results to get better financing rates but at the same time want to pay less tax. It can be expected that most businesses to manipulate when they have a high yield in order to reduce the amount to deliver to the state. Through the analysis of regressions we concluded that companies are more likely to handle are those that have higher yields and lower in line with expectations...|$|R
