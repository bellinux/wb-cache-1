40|$|In 2012, the Iowa {{legislature}} {{passed a}} bill for an <b>act</b> <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> bus safety, including providing penalties for failure <b>to</b> obey <b>school</b> bus warning lamps and stop signal arms, providing for a school bus safety study and administrative remedies, and making an appropriation. The bill, referred to as Iowa Senate File (SF) 2218 or “Kadyn’s Law,” became effective March 16, 2012. A multiagency committee addressed three specific safety study elements of Kadyn’s Law as follows: * Use of cameras mounted on <b>school</b> buses <b>to</b> enhance the safety of children riding the buses and aid in enforcement of motor vehicle laws pertaining to stop-arm violations * Feasibility of requiring <b>school</b> children <b>to</b> be picked up and dropped off {{on the side of}} the road on which their home is located * Inclusion of school bus safety as a priority in driver training curriculum This report summarizes the findings for each of these topics...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} Bachelor’s {{thesis is}} to further {{knowledge}} of how the amendment to the Swedish education <b>act</b> <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> access <b>to</b> <b>school</b> libraries has been implemented. The studys’ starting point has been {{the idea that the}} act has {{had an impact on the}} development of school libraries. The research questions guiding the study were: In what ways do principals actively strive <b>to</b> ensure that <b>school</b> pupils have access <b>to</b> a <b>school</b> library? What opportunities and obstacles emerge in the implementation of the amendment? How do principals view <b>school</b> libraries? <b>To</b> carry out this study an online survey was created and sent to a number of pre-selected school principals. The results were analyzed using implementation theory. According to the results all but one of the investigated <b>schools</b> have access <b>to</b> a library according to their principals’ definitions of access. However, these libraries are not similar to each other and are not used in the same ways. This awakens the issue of how the amendment to the act is interpreted and how the concept of the school library is understood...|$|R
40|$|This Master’s thesis {{examines}} {{whether there}} is consistency between the declaratory level (i. e. laws), {{which is based on}} immigrant integration policy and thus includes the objectives of intercultural pedagogy, and the implementation level (i. e. curricula, teaching materials) in elementary schools. In such case, the curricula should comprise the objectives of intercultural education, in particular the development of intercultural competences, while textbooks should contain topics that would enable to meet the objective of intercultural education. The purpose of the thesis is to demonstrate the presence of intercultural pedagogy objectives at the declaratory level, i. e. in the <b>acts</b> <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> elementary <b>school</b> where, in view of the integrative nature thereof, these objectives are indeed expected. Moreover, the purpose of the thesis is to determine the existence or absence of intercultural education objectives that can be considered as operational, namely the objectives that strengthen intercultural competences. The author looks for such at the implementation level, in the curricula of social science subjects for the first and second educational periods of elementary school. At the implementation level, the author also investigates the existence of topics that {{contribute to the development of}} intercultural competences among the pupils, which is the main objective of intercultural education. Such topics are sought in textbooks and workbooks for the same social science subjects. The main finding of the thesis is that there is no full compliance between the declaratory and implementation levels and/or that there can be compliance provided that the curricula and teaching materials contain explicit objectives and topics which would guide the teachers to develop and enhance pupils’ intercultural competences. Moreover, teachers must be interculturally empathic, informed and trained, in order to be able to enhance and develop intercultural competences even based on indirect objectives and topics, thus providing for intercultural education. The conclusion proposes possible solutions based on the research. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} essay, {{prepared}} for a symposium on dispute resolution in special education held at The Ohio State University Moritz College of Law in February 2014, is to highlight ways that advocates {{for children with disabilities}} can use federal agencies to improve the implementation and enforcement of federal laws protecting children with disabilities in schools—that is, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities <b>Act</b> as it <b>relates</b> <b>to</b> <b>schools.</b> One can {{spend a lot of time}} engaging with the contemporary public conversation about the law surrounding the education of children with disabilities without seeing much about the relevant federal agencies: the Office of Special Education Programs in the Department of Education; the Office for Civil Rights in the Department of Education; and the Civil Rights Division in the Department of Justice. For example, a great deal of the scholarly and advocacy discussion about the enforcement regime for special education law focuses instead on the role of private parties in enforcing the law. This vision of the relevant enforcement universe can be misleading for advocates who are not currently taking advantage of what the federal agencies can provide. It can also be misleading for students planning to practice in this arena; the leading casebooks, like the trend in the scholarship and advocacy material, say very little about engagement with federal agencies. This essay therefore takes a different tack. Instead of focusing on private enforcement, Congress, the courts, or the limitations of federal agencies, I want to capitalize on what is already possible within the agencies and explain how and why to take these possibilities seriously. The goal of the essay is to provide a guide to agency structure and jurisdiction that will help advocates understand more deeply how to approach each office in any given context. More generally, this essay is part of a broader agenda to conceptualize education law as a regulatory field, in order to expand the conventional understanding of both the field of education law and the workings of the regulatory state more generally...|$|R
