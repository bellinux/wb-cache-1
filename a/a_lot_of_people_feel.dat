They just used to skedaddle off to work--I've seen hundreds of 'em, bit of breakfast in hand, running wild and shining to catch their little season-ticket train, for fear they'd get dismissed if they didn't; working at businesses they were afraid to take the trouble to understand; skedaddling back for fear they wouldn't be in time for dinner; keeping indoors after dinner for fear of the back streets, and sleeping with the wives they married, not because they wanted them, but because they had a bit of money that would make for safety in their one little miserable skedaddle through the world. Lives insured and a bit invested for fear of accidents. And on Sundays--fear of the hereafter. As if hell was built for rabbits! Well, the Martians will just be a godsend to these. Nice roomy cages, fattening food, careful breeding, no worry. After a week or so chasing about the fields and lands on empty stomachs, they'll come and be caught cheerful.

5000|$|Speaking of {{the album}} sound, {{frontman}} Klaus Meine said: [...] "We wanted to make an album that was up to date, with a more modern sound to it without losing the Scorpion signature and I think it's still there. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> it's a very good connection between the typical Scorpions sound but in a new way. It wasn't {{so much that we}} were trying to experiment; we still wanted a Scorpions record but not so much a classic rock album like going back to the old days, the 80's. We really wanted a record that would sound like 2007". Guitars on songs on this album are in drop D, drop C and drop C sharp tunnings and those tunings were chosen depending on the Meine's vocal ranges on the songs. Matthias Jabs explained: [...] "Sometimes if you play the guitar riff dropped to a D, it will not only sound different but play different.

5000|$|... "That Still Small Voice" [...] was {{the first}} Once Upon a Time episode written by {{consulting}} producer Jane Espenson.

[...] The episode was directed by Lost veteran Paul Edwards. [...] "That Still Small Voice", featuring Jiminy Cricket, was assigned to Espenson, and she was [...] "thrilled to get it," [...] as she wanted to explore the character in his own story. She elaborated that Jiminy is [...] Someone who you might think of as being part of someone else’s story - even in Pinocchio, he’s all about someone else’s arc. I like taking that character and reminding us all that everyone is the hero of their own story. I related to him because of that, and also because it was such an identifiable story — the way so many people have their adolescence well after adolescence.

5000|$|.....that song is a {{response}} to the way we saw the U.S. government try to reframe the conflicts of the world. Particularly when the Soviet Union had collapsed, {{there was no way to}} subject the country to the kind of fear needed to justify what I consider to be an ill distribution of wealth. After 9/11 you could see that reframing taking place. The specter of Communism no longer haunted the U.S., justifying its actions in Latin America and all over the world. What filled that void were Al Qaeda and the Muslim world in general. That song is, in an abstract way, addressing the way the Right has distracted people from this huge rush of wealth from the bottom to the top.Beyond that, I’m speaking toward a deeper sentiment that I feel and I know <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel.</b> Most of the songs have to do with redemptive moments that come in the face of some real indignity. And that’s the current that I’m trying to tap into, because I think that for a lot of people — for the real participants who live in the shadows and work at car washes and are forced to cross the border and are struggling and facing the real economic consequences — they’re often left out off the debate because of the language they speak or even the terminology that they use.So it stems from my own frustration. It stems from seeing how things have been developing politically, and watching so much dissatisfaction and people very upset about the way the country is going. And watching all of that frustration steered back into a more traditional political process.|$|E
5000|$|On April 17, 2008, {{during the}} top of the eighth inning of a game between the Chicago Cubs and the Cincinnati Reds at Wrigley Field in Chicago, Brennaman made {{comments}} about Cubs fans and the Cubs team. This occurred after then-Reds player Adam Dunn connected for a home run. Cubs fans customarily throw the opposing player's ball back onto the field. In this case, the field was littered with multiple balls thrown by fans onto the field, resulting in a game delay as the field crew recovered the debris. Brennaman's statements were aired over the Reds Radio Network broadcast of the game."This is the kind of thing, quite honestly, right now, that makes {{you want to see the}} Chicago Cubs team lose. Among all baseball fans, and I can't attest to the Yankees or Red Sox, because we don't see them with any degree of regularity unless it's inter-league play, but far and away the most obnoxious fans in baseball, in this league, are those who follow this team right here. Throwing 15 or 18 balls onto the field, there's absolutely no excuse for that, and that is so typical of Chicago Cubs fans. It's unbelievable.""You simply root against 'em. Y'know, I've said all winter they talked about this team winning the division, and my comment is they won't win it, because at the end of the day, they still are the Chicago Cubs, and they will figure out a way to screw this whole thing up."On April 18, 2008, Brennaman appeared in an interview on Chicago sports radio station WMVP-AM 1000 in which he reinforced his position on Cubs fans, and compared Chicago Cubs fans to rival St. Louis Cardinals fans. [...] "If they can't understand what happened Wednesday night was completely over the top, then I'm sorry", Brennaman said. [...] "I said how tough it is to root for the Cubs. I think <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>feel</b> the same way I do, but they won't articulate it. I'm not afraid to say what I think.""to Cubs fans Cardinals fans are hands down the best in baseball. They respect the game. They don't go to the game to do stupid stuff.""The Cubs have some great baseball fans. But the ones who act like idiots (ruin) it for people like me."On February 5, 2010, Brennaman was chastised for commenting that Marshall University's president must be [...] "queer" [...] for softball at the university's baseball banquet and fundraiser.
