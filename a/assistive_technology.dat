5|$|RNC {{hosts the}} UK's first VI Sports Academy, having begun {{as the home}} of the first {{football}} academy for visually impaired players and the England blind football team. It hosted the 2010 World Blind Football Championship and also served as a training facility for participants in the 2012 Paralympic Games. The college is actively involved in the development of <b>assistive</b> <b>technology,</b> including student participation in the Tech Novice Cafe, run for members of the public who are not confident in computer use. Two notable devices were developed at RNC; the Mountbatten Brailler, an electronic braille writer, and the T3, a talking tactile device that helped with the reading of maps and diagrams.|$|E
5|$|On-campus {{facilities}} {{include a}} gym, sports hall, a floodlit all-weather football pitch and tennis courts. RNC's thePoint4 complex offers sporting, leisure and conference facilities, {{as well as}} a bistro, and is open to both students and members of the general public. Other facilities at RNC include the Flexible Learning Centre, which features the latest <b>assistive</b> <b>technology</b> and learning resources and is open seven days a week, a student social club which is licensed to sell alcohol to students who are 18 and over, and a student common room. The college has an active Students' Union which {{plays an important role in}} college life, being responsible for organising leisure activities both on and off campus. There are also on-campus medical facilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{college is}} {{actively}} involved in the development and use of <b>assistive</b> <b>technology</b> to aid visually impaired people in their everyday lives. For example, working with a United States-based software engineer, RNC produced the T3 (Talking Tactile Tablet), a touch sensitive device for interpreting tactile images such as diagrams, charts and maps. The device is connected to a computer and run with a programme CD, and has a tactile surface which produces touchable icons that provide audio feedback when they are pressed. The device was originally developed for educational purposes but can be adapted for other uses. In 2005 Hereford Museum and Art Gallery became the first in the United Kingdom to invest in the technology. The T3 was later marketed internationally {{with the help of the}} UK Trade & Investment's passport initiative– a scheme which gives new exporters the training, planning and support they need to succeed in overseas markets.|$|E

The paper presents preferred <b>assistive</b> <b>technologies</b> and types of educational problems that disabled students face. Impact of <b>assistive</b> <b>technologies</b> on independence in education and on quality of studying was also analyzed. Since the focus of this paper lies on the usability of computer-based <b>assistive</b> <b>technologies,</b> as fundamental elements of the education of disabled students, the importance of their accessibility is being particularly emphasized...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{deals with}} the use of <b>assistive</b> <b>technologies</b> in {{rehabilitation}} programmes, particularly the physically disabled in Hong Kong. The chapter argues that if the <b>assistive</b> <b>technologies</b> can only restore the biological and physical functioning of the disabled, they remain a robot only. When these technologies also manage to improve the social life of the disabled, they can turn into social robots. Following this line of thought, the chapter argues that rehabilitation programmes facilitating the use of <b>assistive</b> <b>technologies</b> in Hong Kong have difficulties in transforming <b>assistive</b> <b>technologies</b> into social robots. The chapter is concluded by further elaborating these difficulties at both the micro- and macro-level. Department of Applied Social Science...|$|R

30|$|Educators {{use such}} {{graphical}} representations {{to teach and}} to exemplify concepts [21], and visually impaired learners are sometimes not allowed to express their knowledge through alternative tasks [22]. In order to convey information in graphical representations to visually impaired learners in classroom activities, educators would have to receive support from assistants or use low-/high-tech <b>assistive</b> <b>technologies</b> [23]. Examples of low-tech <b>assistive</b> <b>technologies</b> are tools such as pens or tactile drawings [24] and physical objects with specific semantics [25, 26]. Examples of high-tech <b>assistive</b> <b>technologies</b> are tactile displays [27], optical character recognition (OCR) [28], screen readers [29], among others.|$|R

25|$|A {{hearing aid}} or deaf aid is an electroacoustic device which is {{designed}} to amplify sound for the wearer, usually with the aim of making speech more intelligible, and to correct impaired hearing as measured by audiometry. This type of <b>assistive</b> <b>technology</b> helps people with hearing loss participate more fully in their communities by allowing them to hear more clearly. They amplify any and all sound waves through use of a microphone, amplifier, and speaker. There is a wide variety of hearing aids available, including digital, in-the-ear, in-the-canal, behind-the-ear, and on-the-body aids.|$|E
25|$|This type of <b>assistive</b> <b>technology</b> {{allows users}} to amplify the volume and clarity of their phone calls {{so that they can}} easily partake in this medium of communication. There are also options to adjust the {{frequency}} and tone of a call to suit their individual hearing needs. Additionally, there is a wide variety of amplified telephones to choose from, with different degrees of amplification. For example, a phone with 26 to 40 decibel is generally sufficient for mild hearing loss, while a phone with 71 to 90 decibel is better for more severe hearing loss.|$|E

They can also be equipped with additional safety features. These features can include sensors that monitor for medical emergencies such as falls or seizures. Smart home technology applied in this way can provide users with more freedom and a higher quality of life.|$|E

25|$|Personal {{emergency}} response systems (PERS), or Telecare (UK term), are a particular sort of <b>assistive</b> <b>technology</b> that use electronic sensors connected to an alarm system to help caregivers manage risk and help vulnerable people stay independent at home longer.

Notably, these alerts can be customized to the particular person's risks. When the alert is triggered, a message is sent to a caregiver or contact center who can respond appropriately.|$|E

There is no cure for CP; however, supportive treatments, medications, and surgery may help many individuals. This may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. Medications such as diazepam, baclofen, and botulinum toxin may help relax stiff muscles. Surgery may include lengthening muscles and cutting overly active nerves. Often external braces and other <b>assistive</b> <b>technology</b> are helpful. Some affected children can achieve near normal adult lives with appropriate treatment.

Systematic reviews of the field have found that the number of ATC are growing rapidly, but have focused on memory and planning, that there is emerging evidence for efficacy, that a lot of scope exists to develop new ATC. Examples of ATC include: NeuroPage which prompts users about meetings, Wakamaru, which provides companionship and reminds users to take medicine and calls for help if something is wrong, and telephone Reassurance systems.|$|E

40|$|Background: Through {{the use of}} <b>assistive</b> <b>technologies</b> {{persons in}} a {{minimally}} conscious state could gain an active engagement role. Objective of the Study: Create an overview of <b>assistive</b> <b>technologies</b> used for rehabilitation interventions, which foster self-determination in adults in a minimally conscious state. Methods: Through a literature search in the databases CINAHL, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, PsycINFO and Medline publications were selected according to the following criteria: (1) adult persons (18 +) with a diagnosis of minimally conscious state, (2) survey of <b>assistive</b> <b>technologies.</b> Findings: Persons in a minimally conscious state can use microswitches to activate an environmental stimulation or a voice output communication aid. Relevance to Clinical Practice: Interventions with <b>assistive</b> <b>technologies</b> are of crucial importance because no other intervention focuses on the acquisition of an active engagement role. Limitations and Recommendations for Further Research: Important results may be missed because publications, which involved beside persons in a minimally conscious state also persons with other disabilities, were excluded. Further research should assess {{the effects of the}} devices and investigate other related devices...|$|R
