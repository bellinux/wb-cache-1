5|$|It {{is a sign}} of Edward's {{high regard}} for Lancaster that he would bestow such {{extensive}} privileges on him. The two men were second cousins through their great-grandfather Henry III and practically coeval (Edward was born in 1312), so it is natural to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> strong sense of camaraderie existed between them. Another factor that might have influenced the king's decision was the fact that Henry had no male heir, so the grant was made for the Earl's lifetime only, and not intended to be hereditary.|$|E

During the loop iteration, a is reduced by multiples of the previous remainder b until a is smaller than b. Then a is the next remainder r'k. Then b is reduced by multiples of a until it is again smaller than a, giving the next remainder r'k+1, and so on.|$|E
5|$|Ceramic {{that were}} {{imported}} to Gedi represent either {{direct or indirect}} trade with China, South Asia, and the Islamic world. Islamic pottery found at Gedi was wheel spun, glazed, and kiln fired, which includes sgraffiato, Yemeni black on yellow ceramics, and figured wares frequently depicting floral designs on blue and white panels. Sgraffiato is red-bodied earthenware with yellow or green glaze that was common in modern-day Iraq from the ninth to the sixteenth century. A type of polychrome stoneware from the sixteenth century characterized by grey, green, and brown glazes may {{have been made in}} Persia or India as an attempted imitation of Chinese porcelain. Another type of partially grey glazed bowls with circular decorations on their interior is believed to come from Indochina since the disappearance of the style coincides with the Thai conquest of the region in AD 1467. Various types of Chinese pottery also appear at Gedi, including celadon and blue and white porcelain, which were found in large enough volumes to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> significant portion of the population had access to higher quality wares, while sherds were also found inlayed in the mosques.|$|E
5|$|During 1989 Prost {{began to}} {{contemplate}} starting his own team, as {{his relationship with}} his McLaren teammate, Ayrton Senna, had turned sour. Prost and John Barnard, formerly chief designer at McLaren, came close to founding a team in 1990; but a lack of sponsorship meant that this was not possible, so Prost moved to Ferrari and Barnard left Ferrari to join Benetton. After falling out with the Italian team at the end of 1991, Prost found himself without a drive for 1992; after the failure of extensive negotiations with Guy Ligier about buying his Ligier team, Prost decided to join Williams for 1993. In 1995, when Prost was working for Renault, people began to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Prost-Renault team would be formed in the near future. Renault refused Prost's request to supply engines for his team, ending the speculation.|$|E

25|$|Dr. David Amit of the Israel Antiquities Authority, who {{has made}} a study of bread stamps {{explained}} the find; “A potter engraved the menorah image in the surface of the stamp prior to firing it in a kiln, whereas the owner’s name was engraved in the stamp’s handle after firing.

25|$|The final {{decades of}} the 20th century have seen {{the rise of a}} new {{interdisciplinary}} approach to studying human psychology, known collectively as cognitive science. Cognitive science again considers the mind as a subject for investigation, using the tools of psychology, linguistics, computer science, philosophy, and neurobiology. New methods of visualizing the activity of the brain, such as PET scans and CAT scans, began to exert their influence as well, leading some researchers to investigate the mind by investigating the brain, rather than cognition. These new forms of investigation <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> wide understanding of the human mind is possible, and that such an understanding may be applied to other research domains, such as artificial intelligence.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} claim, {{that while}} acceptance of Jordanes {{at face value}} may be too naive, a totally skeptical view is not warranted. For example, Jordanes says that the Goths originated in Scandinavia 1490 BC. Austrian historian Herwig Wolfram, believes {{that there might be}} a kernel of truth in that claim, if we <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> clan of the Gutae left Scandinavia long before the establishment of the Amali in the leadership of the Goths. This clan might have contributed to the ethnogenesis of the Gutones in east Pomerania (see Wielbark culture). Another example is the name of the king Cniva which David S. Potter thinks is genuine because, since it doesn't appear in the fictionalized genealogy of Gothic kings given by Jordanes, he must have found it in a genuine 3rd-century source.|$|E
25|$|A simple example: If one sends {{a million}} symbols per second using {{conventional}} single-carrier modulation over a wireless channel, then {{the duration of}} each symbol would be one microsecond or less. This imposes severe constraints on synchronization and necessitates the removal of multipath interference. If the same million symbols per second are spread among one thousand sub-channels, the duration of each symbol can be longer {{by a factor of}} a thousand (i.e., one millisecond) for orthogonality with approximately the same bandwidth. <b>Assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> guard interval of 1/8 of the symbol length is inserted between each symbol. Intersymbol interference can be avoided if the multipath time-spreading (the time between the reception of the first and the last echo) is shorter than the guard interval (i.e., 125 microseconds). This corresponds to a maximum difference of 37.5 kilometers between the lengths of the paths.|$|E
25|$|Roads are, {{by their}} nature, used by {{vehicles}} {{and it is}} clearly foreseeable that a person left lying on the road is {{at risk of being}} further injured by an inattentive driver. Hence, if A leaves B on the road with knowledge of that risk and a foreseeable event occurs, A remains the more proximate cause. This leaves whether the test of foresight should be subjective, objective or hybrid (i.e. both subjective and objective). Obviously, there is no difficulty in holding A liable if A had actual knowledge of the likelihood that B would be further injured by a driver. The fault which caused the initial injury is compounded by the omission to move B to a safer place or call for assistance. But let us <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>A</b> never averts the possibility of further injury. The issue is now the extent to which knowledge may be imputed objectively.|$|E
