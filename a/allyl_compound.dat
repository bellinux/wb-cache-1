Irradiation of (3 -butenyl) compounds 3, 11, 14 and of (4 -pentenyl) compound 6 afforded exclusively the linear photoadducts 4, 12, 15 and 7 respectively. Irradiation of <b>allyl</b> <b>compound</b> 25 brought the desired crossed photoadduct 26. The structures of the photoadducts 4, 7 and 26 were assigned based on spectroscopic analysis and confirmed by subsequent retroaldol cleavage reactions of the corresponding photoproducts.

Retroaldol cleavage of the photoadduct 15, followed by transannular reductive coupling with SmI₂, and hydrolysis of the protecting group provided triol 18.

Rats were orally administered GO (200 mg/kg body weight), DAS (20, 80 mg/kg body weight), DADS (80 mg/kg body weight) or DATS (70 mg/kg body weight) {{three times a week}} for 6 weeks. Control rats received corn oil (2 ml/kg body weight) alone. GO, DADS and DATS treatment significantly increased the glutathione (GSH) content (48 - 84 %) in red blood cells (P < 0. 05). DATS displayed a greater enhancement than GO and DADS (P < 0. 05). Hemolysis induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide was not suppressed by GO or <b>allyl</b> <b>compound</b> treatment although higher GSH content was evident. Hepatic GSH was not influenced by garlic components. In rat livers, DADS and DATS significantly increased the activity of GSH reductase (46 and 54 %, respectively) and of GSH S-transferase (GST) (63 and 103 %, respectively), but decreased the GSH peroxidase activity (27 and 28 %, respectively). In contrast, GSH reductase and GST activities in the DAS group, either 20 or 80 mg/kg body weight, were similar to the control group. A decrease of GSH peroxidase activity was observed in rats dosed with 80 mg/kg body weight (P < 0. 05). An increase in GST activity and a decrease in GSH peroxidase activities were also noted in GO-treated rats (P < 0. 05). In red blood cells, three GSH-related antioxidant enzyme activities were not affected by garlic oil and its organosulfur components. Immunoblot assay showed that, accompanying the increase in hepatic GST activity, GO, DADS, DAS (80 mg/kg body weight) and DATS increased the expression of GST Ya, Yb 1 and Yc proteins.

A molecular modeling study based on the molecular structures using the ALCHEMY software package suggests that the conformations with the beta-Me group in the plane between the Cp* rings are more stable than the conformations with the beta-Me group pointing {{toward one of the}} Cp* ligands. Inactivation of the catalysts is caused by two different mechanisms. At room temperature allylic C-H activation of monomer and isobutene (formed by a minor beta-H transfer termination) gives inactive (meth) <b>allyl</b> <b>compounds,</b> [Cp* 2 M(eta(3) -C 3 H 5) ]+ and [Cp* 2 M(eta(3) -C 4 H 7) ]+ (M = Zr, Hf). At elevated temperatures (> 45 -degrees-C) catalytically inactive zwitterionic complexes Cp* 2 M+-m-C 6 H 4 -BPh 3 - (M = Zr, Hf) are formed through aromatic C-H activation. Reactivation of the inactive (meth) allyl complexes can be achieved by addition of hydrogen to the oligomerization mixtures...|$|R
