5|$|During the Second World War, Britain {{commenced}} <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> project, {{known as}} Tube Alloys, but the 1943 Quebec Agreement merged {{it with the}} American Manhattan Project. Several key British scientists worked {{as part of the}} British contribution to the Manhattan Project, but after the war the Americans ended cooperation on nuclear weapons. In January 1947, a cabinet sub-committee decided, in response to an apprehension of American isolationism and fears of Britain losing its great power status, to resume British efforts to build nuclear weapons. The project was called High Explosive Research, and was directed by Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford, with William Penney in charge of bomb design.|$|E

Many of Britain's top {{scientists}} participated in the British contribution to the Manhattan Project. After the war, fearing that Britain would lose its great power status, the British government resumed the atomic bomb development effort, now codenamed High Explosive Research. The successful test of an atomic bomb in Operation Hurricane in October 1952 represented an extraordinary scientific and technological achievement, but Britain was still several years behind the United States in nuclear weapons technology. In July 1954, Cabinet decided to develop the hydrogen bomb.|$|E

5|$|The {{only other}} United States Air Force combat unit {{to use the}} Silverplate B-29 was the 97th Bombardment Wing at Biggs Air Force Base in El Paso, Texas.

One other Silverplate B-29, on temporary assignment in the United Kingdom, was converted into a weather reconnaissance aircraft (WB-29) and transferred to the 9th Bombardment Wing at Travis Air Force Base in California.

5|$|The MAUD {{reports were}} {{reviewed}} by the Defence Services Panel of the Scientific Advisory Committee. This was chaired by Lord Hankey, with its other members being Sir Edward Appleton, Sir Henry Dale, Alfred Egerton, Archibald Hill and Edward Mellanby. The panel held seven meetings in September 1941, and submitted its report to the Lord President of the Council, Sir John Anderson. At this point it was feared that German scientists were attempting to provide their country with an atomic bomb, and thus Britain needed to finish its first. The report ultimately stated {{that if there were}} even a sliver of a chance that the bomb effort could produce a weapon with such power, then every effort should be made to make sure Britain did not fall behind. It recommended that while a pilot separation plant be built in Britain, the production facility should be built in Canada. The Defence Services Panel submitted its report on 24 September 1941, but by this time the final decision had already been taken. Lord Cherwell had taken the matter to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, who became the first national leader to approve <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> programme on 30 August 1941.

40|$|An infographic {{looking at}} what <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> is and what is main dangers could be. <b>A</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> is <b>a</b> device that uses <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> {{reaction}} to create an explosion. This explosion is much more powerful than that of conventional explosives (like TNT). When <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> explodes, it gives off four types of energy: a blast wave, intense light, heat, and radiation. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> {{can be in the}} form of bombs or missiles. When <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> explodes, <b>a</b> large fireball is created. Everything inside of this fireball vaporizes and is carried upward. This creates a mushroom-shaped cloud. The material in the cloud cools into dust-like particles and drops back to the earth as fallout. Fallout can be carried by the wind and can end up miles from the site of the explosion. Fallout is radioactive and can contaminate anything it lands on. [URL] date from document propertiesinfographic_nuclear_weapon. pd...|$|R
