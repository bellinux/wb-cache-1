5|$|Ijaz {{attained}} {{the rank}} of Full Professor of Physics in 1977, and during the same year served as acting head of the Physics department. After several foreign sabbaticals in the 1980s, the first at U.P.M. in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia from 1979 until 1981 and another at I.C.T.P. in 1985, he continued his teaching duties <b>at</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> until retirement in December 1991 as Professor Emeritus of Physics. During {{the latter part of}} his career, Ijaz published papers that focused on methods and results in teaching, religion and science and other aspects of physics that did not form part of his technical research in earlier years. Also a physicist and teaching researcher <b>at</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech,</b> Lubna Razia Ijaz established a scholarship in 1996 that is awarded to students involved in physics education.|$|E

5|$|Both teams made {{changes to}} their {{respective}} coaching staffs {{in the weeks that}} followed the Sugar Bowl. Chuck Amato resigned from his position as linebackers coach for Florida State to take the head coaching position at North Carolina State. His role as linebackers coach was filled by Joe Kines, whom Bobby Bowden hired from the University of Georgia. Amato's role as assistant head coach was filled by Jim Gladden, who had been a coach at Florida State for more than 25 years at the time he was named the assistant head coach. <b>At</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech,</b> head coach Frank Beamer also made some changes to his coaching staff, promoting several position coaches to higher positions in the Tech football hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|After {{earning his}} doctorate, Clough began his {{academic}} {{career as an}} assistant professor at Duke University in 1969. He joined the faculty at Stanford University in 1974 first as an associate professor and then later as full professor. In 1982, he joined the faculty of Virginia Tech as a professor of civil engineering and served as head of their Department of Civil Engineering for seven years. In 1990, Clough became dean of the Virginia Tech College of Engineering. Clough continued his research and instruction of graduate students <b>at</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> in addition to his administrative responsibilities. Clough's research focused on geotechnical engineering, including earthquake studies, numerical analysis, soil structure interaction, in-situ testing, and underground openings. In 1993, he became provost and vice president for academic affairs at the University of Washington. Clough cofounded the United States Universities Council of Geotechnical Engineering Research (USUCGER), and served as the organization's first president during 1993.|$|E

5|$|Ijaz {{participated in}} the U.S. Atoms for Peace {{initiative}} during the 1970s. The program provided a number of third-world countries, including Pakistan, with civilian nuclear reactor technology to develop energy for peaceful purposes. As a tenured professor of Physics <b>at</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech,</b> he acted as thesis adviser to graduate students {{from around the world}} in experimental physics disciplines. Ijaz made extensive trips abroad during his career, including sabbaticals as a visiting professor at Saudi Arabia's King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals. in the early 1980s and as a visiting faculty member at the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy in 1985. He retired Professor Emeritus of Physics from Virginia Tech in December 1991 after a 27-year career in teaching and research. Ijaz and his wife emigrated to the United States and settled in Virginia, where had five children. He died in 1992 after a battle with cancer.|$|E
5|$|The Peach Bowl was {{the final}} game as head coach of Virginia Tech for Bill Dooley, who had {{accumulated}} a record of 62381 for the Hokies since assuming the head coaching job in 1978. Tech president William Lavery had long disagreed with Dooley {{about the role of}} football <b>at</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech,</b> and prior {{to the beginning of the}} season, Lavery told Dooley that his tenure as coach would end on January 1, 1987. This fact was revealed to the football team and the general public after Tech's third game of the season. At the time, Dooley was the winningest head coach in Virginia Tech history, but was under investigation for recruiting violations and had settled a breach-of-contract lawsuit against the university for $3.5 million. As part of the out-of-court settlement, Dooley was required to quit his position following the Peach Bowl. In the weeks leading up to the game, Dooley dodged questions about his future. On December 23, it was announced that Murray State head coach Frank Beamer would replace Dooley after the Peach Bowl.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, 2009, Garland {{committed}} to play college basketball for the Hokies of Virginia Tech. He announced {{his decision to}} attend the school {{at a press conference}} at the Reebok All-American Camp. Garland had also considered joining the programs at La Salle, Nebraska, Temple, St. Bonaventure, Maryland, Seton Hall, Providence, and Butler. La Salle University is based in Garland's hometown of Philadelphia and its head coach, John Giannini, recruited him especially hard out of high school. His old coach at John Bartram High School, James Brown, supported his commitment to Virginia Tech. Assistant coach James Johnson was the man primarily responsible for recruiting Garland. Rivals.com rated the point guard a three-star recruit, and ESPN ranked him as the 31st-best player of his position in the Class of 2010. Garland officially signed a National Letter of Intent with the team on February 3, 2010 and enrolled <b>at</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> on June 30. Garland would play his freshman season for a Virginia Tech Hokies team that had a large part of its scoring coming from Malcolm Delaney, Jeff Allen, and Dorenzo Hudson in the 2009–10 season. Delaney, their leading scorer, chose to withdraw from the 2010 NBA draft in May 2010 and returned for another season with the Hokies. Garland weighed approximately 170lbs (77kg) entering college, and because of his shooting guard qualities, he was not as highly rated as some of the team's other 2010 recruits, like Jarell Eddie.|$|E
