5|$|On 7 and 8 March 1894, he {{experimented with}} {{expanding}} his shows <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>his</b> first Cat conformation show. The first show had over 600 entries, becoming easily {{the biggest of}} its kind so far, with patrons that included the Duchess of Newcastle, the Countess de Sefton and Lady de Trafford. The publication Fur and Feather praised the new venture and encouraged more. Crufts however wasn't so sure as the initial show had lost over a hundred pounds, and entries {{in some of the}} classes were restricted to only a handful of cats. He held a second show in March 1895, which once again Fur and Feather heaped praise upon, despite the cutbacks that Cruft had initiated to make the show more profitable. Fur and Feather announced in March 1896 that the cat show had been postponed due to Cruft's other business commitments, but he never went on to run such a show again.|$|E
