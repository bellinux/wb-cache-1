The word piercing can refer to the <b>act</b> <b>or</b> practice of body piercing, or to an opening in the body created by this <b>act</b> <b>or</b> practice. Although the history of body piercing is obscured by popular misinformation and by a lack of scholarly reference, ample evidence exists to document that it has been practiced in various forms by both sexes since ancient times throughout the world.|$|E

5|$|An ouster {{clause in}} a statute {{is an attempt}} by the {{legislature}} to prevent an <b>act</b> <b>or</b> decision by a public authority from being challenged before the courts. Such clauses thus serve as a signal to decision-makers that they may operate without fear of intervention by the courts at a later stage. One common kind of ouster clause is the total ouster or finality clause, which is inserted into a statute to indicate that the decision of a particular judge or tribunal is final and cannot be challenged by any court.|$|E
5|$|Errors of law {{committed}} by public authorities when they <b>act</b> <b>or</b> make decisions {{are within the}} jurisdiction of the High Court of Singapore to correct by way of judicial review. On the other hand, the Court is generally unwilling to intervene where the alleged error is one that concerns the facts of the matter. The rationale for this rule is that it is the Court's role in judicial review of administrative action to scrutinize the legality and not the merits of the decisions of public authorities.|$|E

5|$|The broad {{heading of}} {{illegality}} may {{be divided into}} two sub-headings. In the first case, the High Court inquires into whether the public authority was empowered to take a particular course of action or make a decision, and, in the other, whether it exercised its discretion wrongly even though it was empowered to act. Where the Court finds that the public authority had exceeded its jurisdiction or had exercised its discretion wrongly, it may invalidate the <b>act</b> <b>or</b> decision.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} {{judge is}} empowered to exempt {{from being an}} illegal practice any particular <b>act</b> <b>or</b> omission by a candidate, his or her election agents or any other agent or person in paying a sum, incurring an expense or entering into a contract if {{it was done in}} good faith and was due to inadvertence, accidental miscalculation or the like. Similarly, the judge may make an order allowing an authorized excuse for a failure to file a proper return or declaration relating to election expenses if the candidate or his or her principal election agent shows that he or she acted in good faith {{and that there is a}} reasonable explanation for the shortcoming such as inadvertence or illness, or the absence, death, illness or misconduct of some other agent, clerk or officer. In particular, the judge may relieve a candidate from the consequences of an <b>act</b> <b>or</b> omission by his or her principal election agent if he or she did not sanction or connive in it and took all reasonable means to prevent it.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of types of {{legislation}} which can be passed. The strongest is a regulation, an <b>act</b> <b>or</b> law which is directly applicable in its entirety. Then there are directives which bind members to certain goals which they must achieve. They do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them. A decision is an instrument which is focused at a particular person/group and is directly applicable. Institutions may also issue recommendations and opinions which are merely non-binding declarations.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the first}} sub-heading, a public {{authority}} {{will be considered}} as having acted illegally {{if there is no}} legal basis for the action carried out or the decision made (simple ultra vires), or, more specifically, if the authority has made an error concerning a jurisdictional or precedent fact. A precedent fact error is made when an authority comes to a conclusion in the absence of facts that must objectively exist, or in the presence of facts that must not exist, before it has the power to <b>act</b> <b>or</b> decide.|$|E

Under the Education Act, it is an offence for pupils or other persons to assemble on the premises of a school the registration of which has been cancelled. Statutes governing universities provide that student bodies created pursuant to a university's constituent documents must be registered under the Societies Act unless the Minister for Home Affairs has exempted such bodies.|$|E
