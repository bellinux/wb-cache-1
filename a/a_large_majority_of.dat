5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the emerging young {{of a population}} is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of {{one or a few}} years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.|$|E

In the 114th United States Congress, of the 36 Congressional districts in Texas, 25 are held by Republicans and 11 by Democrats. Texas's Senators are John Cornyn and Ted Cruz. Since 1994, Texans have not elected a Democrat to a statewide office. The state's Democratic voters are made up primarily by liberal and minority groups in Austin, San Antonio, Dallas, Houston, Beaumont, and El Paso, as well as minority voters in East Texas and South Texas.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of Australia's colonial period until after the Second World War, people from the United Kingdom made up <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> people coming to Australia, meaning that many people born in Australia can trace their origins to Britain. The colony of New South Wales, founded on 26 January 1788, {{was part of the}} eastern half of Australia claimed by the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1770, and initially settled by Britons through penal transportation. Together with another five largely self-governing Crown Colonies, the federation of Australia was achieved on 1 January 1901.|$|E
50|$|Harold Wilson's Labour Party {{formed a}} {{government}} {{after winning a}} <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> four seats at the 1964 general election. Shortly after this by-election, Wilson called a general election for 31 March. Wilson's hope {{that he would be}} returned to office with <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>majority</b> had been encouraged by the government's victory at the Hull North by-election.

5|$|It {{has been}} known to kill deer, {{especially}} in winter when smaller prey is scarce, or when deer populations become more abundant. One study in the Everglades showed <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> kills (33 of 39) were fawns, but prey up to eight times the bobcat's weight could be successfully taken. It stalks the deer, often when the deer is lying down, then rushes in and grabs it by the neck before biting the throat, base of the skull, or chest. On the rare occasions a bobcat kills a deer, it eats its fill and then buries the carcass under snow or leaves, often returning to it several times to feed.|$|E
5|$|Males perch after {{emerging}} from their nest. They pick out an area {{close to a}} nest with females inside and guard the territory around it so as {{to have a better}} chance of mating. They tend to perch on many different substrates such as stumps, pebbles, wood, weeds, grass blades and low tree branches. Males assume an alert posture, ready for a challenge from another male, or from a predator. One study by a behavioral ecologist, John Alcock, showed that <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the marked wasps returned to the same perch day after day, and two males swapped between two different sites. The species rarely perches on the ground.|$|E
5|$|McGovern–Hatfield {{was put up}} for a vote {{again in}} 1971, with {{somewhat}} weaker provisions designed to gain more support. In polls, <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the public now favored its intent, and McGovern took his name off a final form of it, as some senators were just objecting to him. Nevertheless, in June 1971, it failed to pass again, gaining only a few more votes than the year before. McGovern was now certain that the only way the war would come to a quick end was if there was a new president.|$|E

30|$|Second, Herrero et al. (2010) {{used both}} {{laboratory}} experiments and questionnaire investigations to gain further {{insights into the}} acceptance of the three prominent rules described. In the study four hypothetical situations were presented. Participants had to imagine a bank going bankrupt. Correspondingly, claimants were shareholders, depositors, or non-governmental organizations. In a fourth context the problem was framed in a neutral way. Again, the proportional rule served as a convincing coordination device in the lab and was also accepted by <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> questionnaire respondents. Furthermore, the authors could detect a remarkable sensitivity towards the context within which the situations were presented to participants.|$|R

5|$|An {{estimated}} 5,000 {{buildings were}} damaged beyond repair. In the Qazvin province, 120 buildings were demolished and 50 villages suffered massive damage. In the neighboring Hamadan province, 45 villages were destroyed. <b>A</b> <b>large</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> {{houses in the}} region were single-story masonry buildings, and virtually all of these collapsed. As non-engineered structures, these could not withstand seismic forces, with structural failure and collapse resulting from wall-to-wall separation {{and the lack of}} structural integrity and of a proper lateral system of resisting. Newer structures built in accordance with the Iranian code of practice for seismic-resistant design fared much better. Damage to the historic Kharaqan tomb towers, which were in a good state of preservation before the event, suggests that the earthquake was possibly {{one of the most powerful}} in the region for approximately 900 years.|$|E
5|$|Bert Combs {{was born}} in the Town Branch section of Manchester, Kentucky on August 13, 1911; he was one of seven {{children}} of Stephen Gibson and Martha (Jones) Combs. Combs's father Stephen, a part-time logger and farmer, was active in local politics, despite being a Democrat in a county where <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> residents were Republicans. His mother was a teacher, and she impressed upon her children the importance of a good education. Bert's first school was the two-room Beech Creek grade school. When he reached the seventh grade, his parents sent him and his sister to Oneida Baptist Institute in nearby Oneida because its school term was 8 to 9 months long, as opposed to the 5- to 6-month terms at Beech Creek. Later, Combs and his sister began riding a donkey every day to Clay County High School. Combs excelled academically and skipped some grades, graduating as valedictorian of his class in 1927 at age 15.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{suggested}} that Congress should charter the National Bank with a capitalization of $10million, one-fifth {{of which would}} be handled by the Government. Since the Government did not have the money, it would borrow the money from the bank itself, and repay the loan in ten even annual installments. The rest was to be available to individual investors. The bank was to be governed by a twenty-five member board of directors that was to represent <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the private shareholders, which Hamilton considered essential for his being under a private direction. Hamilton's bank model had many similarities to that of the Bank of England, except Hamilton wanted to exclude the Government from being involved in public debt, but provide a large, firm, and elastic money supply for the functioning of normal businesses and usual economic development, among other differences. For tax revenue to ignite the bank, it was the same as he had previously proposed; increases on imported spirits: rum, liquor, and whiskey.|$|E
50|$|Wilson's {{decision}} {{to call a}} snap election turned {{on the fact that}} his government, elected a mere 17 months previously in 1964, had an unworkably small <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> only 4 MPs.

5|$|In {{addition}} to reporting active processors, Folding@home determines its computing performance as measured in floating point {{operations per second}} (FLOPS) based on the actual execution time of its calculations. Originally this was reported as native FLOPS: the raw performance from each given type of processing hardware. In March 2009 Folding@home began reporting the performance in native and x86 FLOPS, the latter being an estimation of how many FLOPS the calculation would take on a standard x86 CPU architecture, which is commonly used as a performance reference. Specialized hardware such as GPUs can efficiently perform some complex functions in one floating point operation which otherwise needs multiple operations on the x86 architecture. The x86 measurement attempts to even out these hardware differences. Despite conservative conversions, the GPU clients' x86 FLOPS are consistently greater than their native FLOPS and comprise <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> Folding@home's measured computing performance.|$|E
5|$|In the {{scheduled}} March 1965 elections, Tshombe's Convention Nationale Congolaise (CONACO) won <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> the seats, {{but a large}} part of his party soon defected to form the new Front Démocratique Congolais (FDC) making the overall result unclear as CONACO controlled the Chamber of Deputies while the FDC controlled the Senate. Kasa-Vubu, attempting to use the situation to block Tshombe, appointed an anti-Tshombe leader, Évariste Kimba of the FDC, to be prime minister-designate in November 1965 but the largely pro-Tshombe Parliament refused to ratify the appointment. Instead of seeking a compromise candidate, Kasa-Vubu again unilaterally declared Kimba to be Prime Minister, which was again rejected, creating a political deadlock. With the government in near-paralysis, Mobutu seized power in a bloodless coup, ostensibly to stop the political deadlock, on 25 November 1965.|$|E
5|$|The Moderate Party has a pro-European Union policy stance—including {{support for}} exchanging the SEK for the Euro—and also {{supports}} Sweden joining NATO. As one of Europe's new conservative leaders, Reinfeldt {{is seen as}} an important ally of the United States. His party {{is a member of the}} conservative International Democrat Union, together with the Republican Party in the United States and the British Conservative Party, even though its policies are somewhat more liberal than these. During the 2000 United States presidential election, Reinfeldt visited the United States to support the campaign of George W. Bush. Prior to the 2004 United States presidential election, Reinfeldt again expressed his support for Bush. In an interview with the newspaper Stockholm City on 8 March 2004, Reinfeldt said that he preferred Bush over the Democratic Party contender John Kerry, and in a poll conducted by the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet in April 2004, Reinfeldt like <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> his party favoured Bush over Kerry.|$|E
