The ups <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> <b>of</b> her young adult life land her in Corentin's hands, yearning for the 300,000-franc reward promised to her on the capture of Montauran. Marie's focus changes from money to marriage, a sign of hope amid the tragedy of circumstances. When she first considers Montauran, she recognizes that a return of the king would bring privileges; still, her oscillating actions follow the path of her passions, not rational self-interest.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century Scottish {{agriculture}} became susceptible to the ups <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> <b>of</b> world markets. There were dramatic price rises in the First World War, but a slump in the 1920s and 1930s, in which perhaps 40 per cent of Scottish land changed hands, followed by more price rises in the Second World War. In 1947 annual price reviews were introduced {{in an attempt to}} stabilise the market. A series of Acts of Parliament followed, designed to give price support and grants to farmers. After the Second World War and the associated rationing, there was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production. This lasted until the late 1970s, resulting in more intensive farming. More areas of marginal land were brought into production with government subsidies. At the same time, the amount of forest was increased by a factor of three. There was increasing mechanisation of Scottish agriculture. The horse was replaced by the tractor and the combine harvester. This meant that farming became less labour-intensive. In 1951, 88,000 people worked in Scottish agriculture full-time, but by 1991 it had fallen to about 25,000, leading to more depopulation of rural areas. This helped make Scottish agriculture among the most efficient in Europe.|$|E

500|$|Two mines, the Katy and the Hope, owned {{serially}} {{by several}} different companies between the mid-1890s and the mid-1920s, contributed to Basin's prosperity.

However, flooding and fires caused both mines to close by 1896; the Glass brothers {{lost control of}} the property, and the mines went idle. Despite the ups <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> <b>of</b> the local mines and despite several disastrous fires in town, Basin prospered. In 1905, the Basin Reduction Company led by F.

[...] The final verse illustrates André 3000 dealing with a fan who pretends to have been childhood friends with him. [...] It also references Southern culture, including mentions of Cadillacs and extended family gatherings. [...] "Babylon" [...] reflects on religious attitudes towards sex and illustrates André 3000's upbringing and his forbidden attractions throughout childhood. [...] "Jazzy Belle" [...] discusses the group's [...] "increasingly enlightened" [...] view regarding women: [...] "Went from yellin'... bitches and hoes to queen thangs". [...] The album's closer [...] "13th Floor/Growing Old" [...] is a meditation on aging and emphasizes Southern hip hop's legitimacy.|$|E
