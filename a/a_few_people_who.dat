500|$|Like many mascots, Buzz {{communicates}} via hand {{gestures and}} sign language, rather than speech. At some school events, there are <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> dress up as Buzz. The identities {{of these individuals}} must be kept secret until their graduation. They must be in excellent physical condition, about , and {{must be able to}} do a front [...] "suicide" [...] flip called a Buzz Flip, Buzz's trademark move. Those interested in donning the Buzz suit must take part in a two-day tryout, judged by the former Buzz. Buzz is officially part of Georgia Tech's cheerleading team, so the Buzz tryout happens {{at the same time as}} the other cheerleading tryouts.|$|E

500|$|... "Strange Ones" [...] and [...] "I'd Like To Know" [...] {{are both}} songs about the strange people on Cowley Road, Oxford. Mick Quinn tried to {{describe}} the concept: [...] "There's <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are just really out there. There's {{a lot of people}} around Oxford who are real spliffheads and that, who go and lie down in Port Meadow, but I'm not really sure about them. I'm not really sure that they're individuals: they're part of a much larger thing." [...] Danny Goffey added, [...] "They're the sort of people who don't fit in anywhere, who don't link up with everyday life at all." ...|$|E
500|$|This hypothesis, {{although}} not perfect, perhaps best explains the evidence. Eighteen {{months prior to}} an October 1984 conference on lunar origins, Bill Hartmann, Roger Phillips, and Jeff Taylor challenged fellow lunar scientists: [...] "You have eighteen months. Go back to your Apollo data, {{go back to your}} computer, do whatever you have to, but make up your mind. Don't come to our conference unless you {{have something to say about}} the Moon's birth." [...] At the 1984 conference at Kona, Hawaii, the giant impact hypothesis emerged as the most popular. Before the conference, there were partisans of the three [...] "traditional" [...] theories, plus <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were starting to take the giant impact seriously, and there was a huge apathetic middle who didn’t think the debate would ever be resolved. Afterward there were essentially only two groups: the giant impact camp and the agnostics.|$|E
500|$|While {{the editor}} of Personal Computer World was on holiday in May 1981, his colleagues publicised the magazine's review of the ZX81 with a cover showing a {{chimpanzee}} with the machine above the strapline [...] "Editor benchtests the ZX81". (The chimp returned in later issues to [...] "benchtest" [...] all of Sinclair's subsequent computers.) The review, which was written by PCW staffer Dave Tebbutt, acknowledged that the machine had significant shortcomings but nonetheless represented [...] "absolutely amazing value for money". He described the ZX81 as [...] "a lovely product which will have enormous appeal to people wanting {{to find out more}} about computers, but without it costing them an arm and a leg" [...] and concluded: [...] "If you know nothing about computers and you want to enjoy finding out about them, then this machine offers a value for money way of doing just that. Children will love the ZX81, there can be no question about that, and I suspect that more than <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are already familiar with computers will buy one, just to have a bit of fun." ...|$|E

Reviewing {{the second of}} these, The Manchester Guardian said, [...] "Readers of Little Comedies know how patiently and ingeniously Mr. Sturgis can draw what may be called the minor scoundrel – the scoundrel whose scoundrelism is so successfully concealed from the world and from himself {{that it is only}} <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> know him to be a scoundrel at all.

2500|$|According to {{rock music}} historian, Ian McFarlane, {{it is one}} of the most covered songs written by an Australian with 27 {{different}} artists recording it in 1975 alone. Covers include fellow Australians, Col Joye and Digby Richards, and international artists, Mac Davis, Terry Jacks, Gary Glitter, Joe Dassin (in French), The Cats and Tom Jones. Some cover artists, including Davis, leave out the lyric [...] "... I'd never be a star" [...] for a happier ending. Johnson believes [...] "There were <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> wouldn't sing [...] because in their minds they were big stars". Others, like Glitter, leave out the upbeat ending in the Johnson version for a more sombre ending. Jacks' version went to No.97 in the US in 1974 – it reached No.22 in Canada – and Davis' rendition became the highest US charting version, reaching No.15 in 1975.|$|E
5000|$|In 1997, Harvard Business Review {{identified}} The Fifth Discipline {{as one of}} {{the seminal}} management books of the previous 75 years.

2500|$|On 5 September 1931, Celtic {{were playing}} their Old Firm rivals Rangers at Ibrox Park in Glasgow {{in front of}} 80,000. Early {{in the second half}} Thomson and a Rangers player, Sam English, went for the ball at the same time. Thomson's head {{collided}} with English's knee, fracturing his skull and rupturing an artery in his right temple. Thomson was taken off the field in a stretcher; most people assumed that he was just badly concussed, but <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had seen his injuries suspected worse. One source said, [...] "There were gasps in the main stand, a single piercing scream being heard from a horrified young woman"; this was believed to be the scream of 19-year-old Margaret Finlay, who was watching with Jim Thomson (brother of John). One Rangers player, also a medical student, said later that {{as soon as he saw}} him he gave little chance for his survival.|$|E
2500|$|Monitor loudspeakers, {{also called}} [...] "foldback" [...] loudspeakers, are speaker {{cabinets}} {{which are used}} onstage to help performers to hear their singing or playing. As such, monitor speakers are pointed towards a performer or {{a section of the}} stage. [...] They are generally sent a different mix of vocals or instruments than the mix that is sent to the main loudspeaker system. [...] Monitor loudspeaker cabinets are often a wedge shape, directing their output upwards towards the performer when set {{on the floor of the}} stage. [...] Two-way, dual driver designs with a speaker cone and a horn are common, as monitor loudspeakers need to be smaller to save space on the stage. [...] These loudspeakers typically require less power and volume than the main loudspeaker system, as they only need to provide sound for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are in relatively close proximity to the loudspeaker. [...] Some manufacturers have designed loudspeakers for use either as a component of a small PA system or as a monitor loudspeaker. In the 2000s, a number of manufacturers produced powered monitor speakers, which contain an integrated amplifier.|$|E

30|$|In {{the middle}} of the twentieth century natural resin was {{replaced}} by mineral oil-based chemicals. Therefore, the trade has been rigorously reduced in Europe.

Today natural resin is used for some niche products, e.g., balms. Colophony from natural resin plays a role to improve the sound of string instruments [4].|$|R
50|$|After <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years, <b>people</b> <b>who</b> {{had been}} treated unsuccessfully by ECT started coming forward and sharing their stories with the press. In {{the first years of}} {{administering}} Electroconvulsive shock therapy there was little modification by anesthetics, or muscle relaxants. Because of this the treatments were often frightening to both watch and receive. Because of this ECT was starting to be received as a punishment for deviant behaviors, not as a treatment for psychiatric disorders.|$|R

6000|$|There is {{the clearest}} {{evidence}} that nearly everyone {{is anxious to}} get out of the war now.

Quietly perhaps and unobtrusively, everyone I know is now trying to find the way out of the war, and I am convinced that the same is the case in Germany. That is what makes the Peace-at-any-price campaign so exasperating. It is like being chased by clamorous geese across a common in the direction in which you want to go. But how are we to get out--with any credit--in such a way as to prevent a subsequent collapse into another war as frightful? ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{have always}} been, {{and always will}} be, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> cannot see that.

They think that his mind and {{character}} are only made up of all the thoughts, and feelings, and recollections which have passed through his brain; and that as his brain changes, he himself must change, and become another person, and then another person again, continually. But do you not agree with them: but keep in mind wise Herder's warning that you are not to [...] "confound the organ with the power," [...] or the engine with the driver, or your body with yourself: and then we will go on and consider how a volcano, and the lava which flows from it, helps to make your body.|$|E
60|$|This {{was quite}} true.

They knew that all of Oz, including their own territory, was ruled by a beautiful Princess named Ozma, who lived in the splendid Emerald City; yet the simple folk of Oogaboo never visited Ozma. They had a royal family of their own--not especially to rule over them, but just as a matter of pride. Ozma permitted the various parts of her country to have their Kings and Queens and Emperors and the like, but all were ruled over by the lovely girl Queen of the Emerald City.|$|E
