25|$|An aquifer is an {{underground}} layer of water-bearing permeable rock, rock fractures or unconsolidated materials (gravel, sand, or silt) from which groundwater can be extracted using a water well. The study of water flow in aquifers and {{the characterization of}} aquifers is called hydrogeology. Related terms include aquitard, which is a bed of low permeability along an aquifer, and aquiclude (or <b>aquifuge),</b> which is a solid, impermeable area underlying or overlying an aquifer.

30|$|The {{evolution}} {{characteristic of}} water-resisting property of clay during mining {{has been a}} key point in water-preserved coal mining, the study which is still insufficient. According to the water-resisting property change of clay caused by strata displacement and deformation, Liu (2016) divided the evolution of water-resisting property of clay into three stages, impermeability keeping stage, impermeability decreasing stage, and impermeability losing stage. Huang et al. (2010) stated that the breaking of bedrocks is the main factor that influence development of the “upward fissures”, while the hydrological properties of clay are the main factors that influence close of “downward fissures”. The relationship between “upward fissures” and “downward fissures” determined {{the stability of the}} <b>aquifuges</b> impermeability.|$|R

The system shows two aquifers with one aquitard (a confining or impermeable layer) between them, surrounded by the bedrock aquiclude, which is in contact with a gaining stream (typical in humid regions). The water table and unsaturated zone are also illustrated. An aquitard is a zone within the earth that restricts the flow of groundwater from one aquifer to another.

30|$|The main {{overlying}} aquifer {{is derived}} from the local Quaternary aquifer. The pore water containing in the Quaternary aquifer is relatively weak and in general recharged mainly by atmospheric water and surface water. The overlying <b>aquifuge</b> locating in the Neogene stratum, is mainly composed of brown–red clay and mild clay which are widely distributed and have excellent impermeability. As listed in Table 1, the average distance between <b>aquifuge</b> and the 4 # Coal Seam roof is about 141.5  m.|$|E
30|$|Expansibility {{is one of}} the {{important}} physical properties of clay. On the one hand, the porosity of clay deteriorates after clay absorbs water and expands making it relatively impermeable. On the other hand, the change of clay strain–stress field due to coal mining results in the partial rupture of clay, and the expansibility of clay regenerates the cracks in clay that can be accessible to water. The expansibility experiment of <b>aquifuge</b> clay is significant for understanding clay <b>aquifuge</b> layers in mining operations.|$|E
30|$|Among the {{secondary}} factors of B 2 (hydrogeological conditions), {{the weight of}} the <b>aquifuge</b> C 7 is larger than the aquifer C 8. Among the third-tier factors of C 7, the thickness D 9 has the maximum weight.|$|E
30|$|The {{prediction}} {{results indicate}} that: (1) the water-conducted fissures are strongly developed {{and go through}} the Neogene <b>aquifuge</b> in some region; thus, it may lead to potential perviousness of coal mine; (2) part of these water-conducted fissures connect with the ground fissures; and this behavior may cause the risk of air leakage.|$|E
30|$|In {{the mining}} of the 4 # Coal Seam, one {{may affect the}} safety of mining is the Quaternary aquifer. The {{underlying}} stratum of the Quaternary aquifer is the Neogene red clay, in which the water-conducted fissures cannot strongly develop.

Correctly {{analyze the}} {{formation}} mechanism and failure mode of the landslide and reasonably evaluate {{the stability of}} landslide, can provide scientific basis for landslide controlling. Employed the field investigation, field monitoring, indoor experiment and numerical simulation methods to carry a systematic study on the stability condition and formation mechanism of the Bei-Hei expressway expansion project K 178 landslide, the results show that: the silty clay which is loose when dried, and is soft plastic when saturated glides along the surface of bedrock; the safety factor during surveying is 1. 21, the landslide is temporarily in a steady state, when the water content of rupture surface soil is increased to 30. 5 %, the safety factor will reduce to below 1. 0, the landslide will be instability; atmospheric precipitation, snowmelt water and seasonally frozen soil thawing water provide water for landslide, cracks and high permeability of main body soil provide passage for water infiltration, mudstone and sandstone with low permeability form <b>aquifuge,</b> silty clay above the <b>aquifuge</b> which is influenced by infiltration water to reach saturation forms rupture surface...|$|E
30|$|The {{prediction}} {{results indicate}} that: (1) the water-conducted fissures are strongly developed {{in both the}} west and the east sides of the panel as well as partial area of the middle part, and go through the Neogene <b>aquifuge</b> in some region; thus, it may lead to potential perviousness of coal mine; (2) part of these water-conducted fissures connect with the ground fissures; and this phenomenon may cause the risk of air leakage.|$|E
30|$|The {{study of}} {{geological}} and hydrogeological conditions {{is the basis}} of water preserved coal mining. The mining area is divided into water rich and water poor subareas according to the survey of geological conditions, geological structure, water bountifulness of the aquifers and rechargeable condition of the area. Coal should be mined by highly mechanized mining technology in water poor mining areas while the water preserved coal mining technology should be implemented in waterrich mining areas. The current geological data (Fan 1992) shows that the hydrogeological conditions of Yushenfu coal mining area can be divided into four categories, namely isolated small water rich basins, large aquifers without a clay <b>aquifuge,</b> aquifers with a stable clay <b>aquifuge</b> and SalaWuSu-burnt rock aquifers. However, due to the area variability of geological conditions and inadequate drilling holes, the accurate knowledge of geological conditions is absence within each partition. For each working face, detailed geological conditions should be explored through exploration drilling, geophysical exploration, and geochemical exploration. In 2015, the water rich burnt rock area of 5 − 2 coal seam of Hongliulin coal mine was determined through geophysical exploration, which provided a support for implementing water-preserved coal mining technology.|$|E

30|$|The {{above-mentioned}} researches {{have made}} important contributions in water-conserving mining {{in areas with}} fragile ecological environment. They have improved the theoretical basis of water-conserving mining, supplemented the technology system and broadened the concept of water-conserving mining. These researches also have pointed out the factors that must be considered during the water-conserving mining. Fan et al. (2016) has analyzed the relationship between groundwater level decline and high-intensity mining of coal seams. It {{has pointed out that}} the mining intensity is determined by the dimensions of working face, mining height and advance velocity and etc. Huang (2017) holds that mining depth, mining height, overlying strata thickness and properties determine the development of upward and downward cracks of water-resisting rocks. Miao et al. (2007) has studied the water-resisting capability of composite water-resisting key layer from the aspect of strata combination. Wang et al. (2010) has divided the spatial relations between the coal and the aquifer (<b>aquifuge)</b> based on overlying strata thickness, mining height, aquifer thickness, <b>aquifuge</b> thickness, water-physical properties and etc. Ma et al. (2013) has divided the aquifers based on loose aquifer thickness, permeability coefficients and supply patterns. In addition, the empirical calculation formula of height of water flowing fractured zone has been given based on the mining height.|$|E
30|$|However, in {{both the}} west and the east sides of the panel, as well as partial area of the middle part, the water-conducted {{fissures}} are strongly developed with great height. This also means the water-conducted fissures completely go through the Neogene <b>aquifuge,</b> and connect to the Quaternary aquifer. Therefore, in this case, the ground water can infiltrate into the mine via the water-conducted fissures. In addition, part of these water-conducted fissures connects to the ground fissures. The air pressure along the water-conducted fissures will probably cause the air leakage, and bring potential damage to the mining safety.|$|E
30|$|If the water-conducted {{fissures}} completely {{go through}} the overlying <b>aquifuge,</b> then the water contained in the aquifer will most likely flow into the mined-out area. Furthermore, this will increase the inflow, and even lead the roof water inrush. In addition, if the water-conducted fissures connect with the ground fissures, then the leakage channel will be formed, which probably would destroy the underground ventilation cycle, and may lead to spontaneous combustion of coal and other dangers. Therefore, the prediction {{of the distribution of}} the ground fissures and water-conducted fissures induced by the mining subsidence is needed to be carried out to guarantee the safety in mine production.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} solve the {{difficult}} problems on coal mine floor water inrush evaluation, {{on the basis of}} the servo-controlled permeability test of rock in the complete stress-strain process, the concept of expansive limits anti-permeability strength was presented. Then established coal floor water inrush model, the model includes the floor <b>aquifuge</b> effective thickness, lithology, rock mass integrity and expansive limits anti-permeability strength and detailed describes how to get valus the factors. Finally, took No. 17 coal seam of Yangcun coal mine in Yanzhou as an applicational example, it proves that the expansive limits anti-permeability strength method is feasible on the floor water inrush evalution...|$|E
30|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} testing {{results showed}} that Jingle and Baode laterite contained abundant montmorillonite, kaolinite, illite, and clay minerals such as illite-montmorillonite mixture and chlorite. Montmorillonite comprised 23 and 21 %, respectively, of the mixtures and was most influential on the permeability of clay. The mineral crystal structure of montmorillonite determined its high expansibility after water absorption. The water expansion characteristic of montmorillonite reduced the crack of clay, and accordingly resulted in a smaller permeability. In situ permeability test showed that cracks in Jingle laterite and Baode laterite did not develop under natural conditions, and after contact with water the montmorillonite minerals expanded to fill the internal cracks of soil and resulted in an <b>aquifuge</b> effect. However, after large-scale coal mining, a variety of cracks in soil would develop; corrosion would readily occur because of expansion of the clay layers, followed by a corresponding increase in permeability.|$|E
30|$|The aquifuges of Yushenfu {{coal mining}} area are mainly {{overlying}} bedrocks (siltstone) and clay (yellow and red clay) (Huang et al. 2010; Huang 2003). The thickness of bedrock aquifuges is normally less than 150  m and the thickness/load ratio of bedrock {{is no more}} than 1 (Huang 2002). The coal seam is shallow and bedrocks are thin, thus the working face bears large dynamic loadings which could result in step subsidence. The collapse of overlying rocks only exists in “two zones”, namely water conducting fissure zone and fractured zone, and the fragmentation degree of overburden rock is large. If the clay layers are absent in overlying bedrocks, the “two zones” will directly contact with the aquifer. The structure of <b>aquifuge</b> will be completely destroyed, causing loss of water. If there is a clay layer in the overlying bedrocks, whether the “two zones” will penetrate into the clay layer depends on the thickness and mechanical properties of the layer.|$|E
40|$|Sudden {{water inrush}} {{has been a}} deadly killer in {{underground}} engineering for decades. Currently, especially in developing countries, frequent water inrush accidents still kill {{a large number of}} miners every year. In this study, an approach for predicting the probability of fault-induced water inrush in underground engineering using the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was developed. Six parameters related to the aquifer, the water-resisting properties of the <b>aquifuge</b> and the mining-induced stresses were extracted as the major parameters to construct the ANFIS model. The constructed ANFIS was trained with twenty reported real fault-induced water inrush cases, and another five new cases were used to test the prediction performance of the trained ANFIS. The final results showed that the prediction results of the five cases were completely consistent with the actual situations. This indicates that the ANFIS is highly accurate in the prediction of fault-induced water inrush and suggests that quantitative assessment of fault-induced water inrush using the ANFIS is possible...|$|E
40|$|Stress and {{deformation}} {{of the rock}} masses around the mine seam induced by mining can affect the water system and the <b>aquifuge</b> within the mining fields region and then often causes coal mine water hazards during mining under waters. In this study, based on the geological and hydrogeological condition of the mining fields and considering the water flowing fracture zone and the caving zone, fine model describing the rock structures, rock properties and effects of mining activities is established. The groundwater seepage evolution is analyzed after mining and the water inrush is forecasted on roof of working faces, adopting the seepage mechanics theory. According to the water inrush forecasting results in different mining depth, the safely mining depth under waters is decided. The research results indicate that strip-partial mining with coal pillars in coal seams under the waters is effective method during mining under waters and after mining to a certain depth, the coal seam can be mined fully safely. The study provides a theoretical basis and practical guidance for decision-making of “three-underground” mining, coal mine water hazards prediction and prevention...|$|E
40|$|Most of {{exogenous}} epigenetic sulphur deposits {{are clearly}} associated with intensely karstified carbonate and sulphate rocks. This paper demonstrates, using the Pre-Carpathian region as an example, that karstification {{is one of}} the most important processes guiding the formation of sulphur deposits. This is determined by a coincidence of some major prerequisites of these two processes. In the Podol'sky and Bukovinsky regions the Miocene aquifer system is well drained by erosion valleys; the giant network caves known here in gypsum formed under past artesian conditions. In the region of sulphur deposits, associated with the same karstified gypsum strata, true artesian conditions still prevail. Hydrogeologic data show that abundant cavities detected in the vicinity of sulphur deposits can be interpreted as having the same origin as the relict caves of the Podol'sky and Bukovinsky regions. The widespread belief that the gypsum/anhydrite bed in the region is an <b>aquifuge</b> separating the Miocene aquifers is inadequate. This belief caused much controversy with regard to the genetic interpretations of sulphur deposits in the region. Cave systems formed by the upward water flow through the gypsum/anhydrite bed govern the water exchange between the aquifers within the aquifer system. A new karst model for the formation of sulphur deposits is suggested. It agrees well with the hydrogeological features of the Miocene sequence and with biogeochemical mechanisms of sulphur origin in low-temperature diagenetic environments...|$|E
30|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} the impact of mining on the permeability of key <b>aquifuge</b> (N 2 laterite) that is widespread in the arid and semi-arid areas of northwestern China and is critical for preserving water resources. The impact of mining stress recovery on the permeability of cracked N 2 laterite was assessed for parts of northwestern China that included the Jingle laterite and Baode laterite. The mineral compositions and swelling properties of the laterite at both locations were examined, and analytical results showed that the laterite contained abundant clay minerals. The Baode laterite exhibited higher expansibility than Jingle laterite. The triaxial creep permeability performance of laterite specimens with a prefabricated crack width of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.5  mm were tested. The results indicated that strain of cracked laterite all exhibited transient creep following each level of loading, and then unstable creep and stable creep. With the increase of loading, the transient creep deformation corresponding to each level of loading decreased, the unstable creep deformation produced by identical loading gradually and incrementally increased. The nonlinear power function equation was selected to fit creep grading curves which have high precision. The cracks within the laterite gradually closed with the stress recovery, and permeability gradually recovered. During the stress recovery, the narrower cracks exhibited a smaller change in permeability. However, for narrow cracks in mining soil, permeability recovered after mining stress when permeability was closer to initial permeability, and the Baode laterite showed greater recovery than that of the Jingle laterite.|$|E
40|$|Se plantea para la cuenca Martín-Carnaval, un modelo {{conceptual}} hidrodinámico basado en siete años de estudios. Se distinguen dentro del sistema geohidrológico los subsistemas Activo (Zona No-Saturada y acuíferos freático + semilibre Pampeano + semiconfinado Puelche) y Profundo (acuíferos Paraná y Olivos) sobre un basamento acuífugo, analizándose las interrelaciones dentro del primero. La recarga ocurre por la ZNS y conjunto freático-Pampeano hacia el semiconfinado en los sectores medio-superior, invirtiéndose el sentido del flujo vertical en la planicie del río de la Plata. La circulación horizontal incluye la descarga como caudal básico del subsistema activo y el flujo regional hacia el río de la Plata. Considerando el sector medio-superior, los resultados del modelo indican sobre 34. 7 hm 3 de excesos, salidas de 1. 82 hm 3 por efluencia superficial, 7. 0 hm 3 por filtración vertical (de los cuales 1. 31 hm 3 egresan por el acuífero semiconfinado), 0. 63 hm 3 por efluencia freática y 5. 4 hm 3 son extraídos por bombeo, con una variación de almacenaje de 18. 54 hm 3. En una zona del sector medio, la relación hidráulica favorece al acuífero semiconfinado, con transferencia vertical ascendente. Comparando los aportes netos con la efluencia subterránea se verifica la validez de las cifras, controlándose las variaciones del almacenamiento a través de una red de registro en operación. A conceptual {{hydrodynamic model}} based on {{seven years of}} study is formulated for the Martin-Carnaval basin. Considering a geohydrologic system divided into two subsystems: active (non-saturated zone and the phreatic + semifree Pampean + semiconfined Puelche aquifers) and deep (Parana and Olivos aquifers, located on an <b>aquifuge</b> basement), a discussion on the interrelations in the former subsystem is presented. The recharge occurs by the non-saturated zone and the phreatic-Pampean aquifers to the semiconfined aquifer in the medium-higher sector, while in the River Plate coastal plain {{the direction of the}} upward flow reverses. The horizontal circulation includes the discharge as the base flow of the active subsystem and the regional flow to the River Plate. Considering a surplus of 34. 7 hm 3, the results of the model in the middle-upper sector show an output of 1. 82 hm 3 by surface outflow, 7. 0 hm 3 by vertical leakage (1. 31 hm 3 of which flow by the semiconfined aquifer), 0. 63 hm 3 by phreatic outflow and 5. 4 hm 3 are extracted by pumping with a storage variation of 18. 54 hm 3. In an area of the medium sector, the hydraulic relation favours the semiconfined aquifer, with an upward vertical transfer. When the net inputs are compared with the groundwater outflow, the validity of the magnitudes can be corroborated, the storage variations being controlled through a recording network under operation...|$|E
