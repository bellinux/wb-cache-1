40|$|While {{technology}} and computers dramatically affect our lives, their growth in education for instructional use {{has been less}} dramatic. At the higher education level, technology use is frequent in administration and research, but less in instruction. During 1995 / 1996 <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> at <b>an</b> U.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the impact of three leadership styles as a predict or of job satisfaction in a state university system. The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire was used to identify the leadership style of an administrator as perceived by <b>faculty</b> <b>members.</b> Spector’s Job Satisfaction Survey {{was used to assess}} <b>a</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>member’s</b> level of job satisfaction. The population consisted of 567 full-time <b>faculty</b> <b>members,</b> and 104 participants completed the survey. The results of logistic regression analysis revealed that (<b>a)</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> who identified transformational leadership as dominant had increased job satisfaction, (b) <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> who identified transactional leadership as dominant had increased job satisfaction, and (c) <b>faculty</b> <b>members</b> who identified passive/avoidant leadership as dominant had decreased job satisfaction. Demographics did not appear to predict satisfaction. Using this model, academic leaders can take further action by refining their leadership styles {{on the basis of their}} faculty members’ indicated preferences. The study results may contribute to social change at the departmental level by making academic administrators aware of effective leadership models that promote higher job satisfaction among faculty in universities...|$|R
5|$|A {{native of}} Ohio, Gottesman studied {{psychology}} for his {{undergraduate and graduate}} degrees, became <b>a</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>member</b> at various universities, {{and spent most of}} his career at the University of Virginia and the University of Minnesota.

Gottesman has worked with researchers to analyze hospital records and conduct follow-up interviews of twins where one or both were schizophrenic. He has also researched the effects of genetics and the environment on human violence and variations in human intelligence. Gottesman and co-researcher James Shields introduced the word epigenetics—the control of genes by biochemical signals modified by the environment {{from other parts of the}} genome—to the field of psychiatric genetics.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from Cornell, Chamberlin {{was hired by}} the University of Utah, where he worked from 1904 to 1908, as an assistant professor (19041905) then full professor. He soon began improving biology courses, which at the time were only of high school grade, to collegiate standards, and introduced new courses in vertebrate histology and embryology. He was the first dean of University of Utah School of Medicine, serving from 1905 to 1907. During the summer of 1906, his plans to teach a summer course in embryology at the University of Chicago were cancelled when he suffered a serious accident in a fall, breaking two leg bones and severing an artery in his leg. In 1907, University officials decided to merge the medical school into an existing department, which made Chamberlin's deanship obsolete. He resigned as dean in May, 1907, although remained <b>a</b> <b>faculty</b> <b>member.</b> The medical students strongly objected, crediting the school's gains {{over the past few years}} largely to his efforts.|$|E
