A model is proposed in which sensor learns the activity of all persons entering in home and generates <b>alert</b> <b>notifications</b> on administrator’s mobile when a person deviates from its normal activity. If an anonymous person comes, he is tracked every time and notifications are generated when he tries to affect any device or lock. The model has the capability to categorize persons on the basis of criteria and decide the functionalities and access available to them in the smart home. It has the facility of monitoring the devices used and generates alerts when any device starts works improperly...|$|E

40|$|This thesis assembles and {{presents}} {{a set of}} organization generic, but alert notification specific recommendations. Recommendations any arbitrary organization may consider to establish and continuously improve well structured, secure and efficient <b>alert</b> <b>notifications</b> to relevant stakeholders. <b>Alert</b> <b>notifications</b> are only vaguely covered in traditional, generic and holistic change management, incident response and business recovery processes. Incident response, business (emergency) recovery, business contingency and crisis management is covered in general by several “best practices”, standards and recommendations. Relevant fragments {{can be drawn from}} some, but none of them provide detailed, specific recommendations as to how <b>alert</b> <b>notifications</b> {{can be used as a}} business beneficiary communication tool. Several organizations are required by law to alert notify authorities in certain situations and have developed their own solutions for the purpose. Solutions typically later improved and expanded, based on organizational experience gained, end user demands, expectations and requirements. Societal, corporate and governmental dependency of telecom and data services has been and is increasing. Increased dependency leads to increased expectations and demands towards service providers in general. The current general expectation is that telecom and data services are resilient, stable and available for use, at all times, everywhere. No matter how resilient, robust and secure these services are designed to be though, incidents will happen and they do. When they do, service providers are expected to handle them efficiently, professionally and in a predictable manner (including an expectation to keep relevant stakeholders informed). Alert notification is a simple communication tool that can support the service provider, keeping relevant stakeholders informed about the progress in a professional manner. Informed stakeholders are enabled to “workaround” occurred incidents and maintain “business as usual” more efficiently. <b>Alert</b> <b>notifications</b> also provide a common situational awareness amongst receivers, relevant to stakeholders expected to take more active action should the situation escalate further (e. g. members of internal crisis management team) and/or enable stakeholders to make more correct decisions (e. g. how long the undesirable effect of the situation can be endured before end user has to initiate own internal business recovery and/or contingency processes). The current and quite mature alert notification solution 1 of the thesis topic provider, Telenor, is used as a case basis for the thesis. The current limited but publicly available relevant literature, combined with knowledge and experience collected from Telenor internal alert notification stakeholders and external expert contributors, is utilized by the master candidate, to provide a set of generic but alert notification specific recommendations, through this master thesis. The thesis is aimed to provide any arbitrary organization and stakeholders of the topic with thorough understanding of the topic. The thesis provided organization generic, alert notification specific set of recommendations, provides a basis for any arbitrary organization to establish and continuously improve well structured, secure and efficient <b>alert</b> <b>notifications...</b>|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the circumstances under}} which persons with dementia become lost while driving, how missing drivers are found, and how Silver <b>Alert</b> <b>notifications</b> are instrumental in those discoveries. DESIGN: A retrospective, descriptive study. SETTING: Retrospective record review. PARTICIPANTS: Conducted using 156 records from the Florida Silver Alert program for October 2008 through May 2010. These alerts were issued in Florida for missing drivers with dementia. MEASUREMENTS: Information derived from the reports on characteristics of the missing driver, antecedents to missing event, and discovery of a missing driver. RESULTS: The majority of missing drivers were men aged 58 to 94 who were being cared for by a spouse. Most drivers became lost on routine, caregiver-sanctioned trips to usual locations. Only 15 % were driving when found, with most being found in or near a parked car. Law enforcement officers found the large majority. Only 40 % were found in the county where they went missing, and 10 % were found in a different state. CONCLUSION: Silver <b>Alert</b> <b>notifications</b> were most effective for law enforcement; citizen alerts resulted in a few discoveries. There was 5 % mortality in the study population, with those living alone more likely to be found dead than alive. An additional 15 % were found in dangerous situations such as stopped on railroad tracks. Thirty-two percent had documented driving or other dangerous errors, such as driving the wrong way or into secluded areas or walking in or near roadways...|$|E
