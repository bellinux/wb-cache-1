5|$|A hunter named Robinson, whose {{cabin was}} at the lake's {{northern}} end about 1800, was the first recorded inhabitant. He gave the lake its earliest known name: Robinson's Lake. However, {{for most of the}} 19th century the lake was known as Long Pond, because of its elongated shape. From 1822 to 1827 the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which followed the lake's western shore, was built between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. Beginning in 1827 the northbound daily stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> Pond Tavern on the lake about noon. The stage operated until 1851; the road was the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike until 1908, when the modern Pennsylvania Route 487 was built. Route 487 follows the course of the turnpike as it approaches the lake from the south, then passes to the east of the lake instead.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} June 14, 2010, in Hawaii. Filming {{was moved to}} California in August 2010, primarily <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> Beach shore and a recreation of Whitecap Bay done in the Universal Studios backlot, as the original Hawaiian location on Halona Cove was plagued with strong tides. After a brief shoot in Puerto Rico, with locations in both Palomino Island and the Fort of San Cristóbal in San Juan, production moved to the United Kingdom in September, where principal photography wrapped on November 18 after 106 days of shooting. Locations included Hampton Court Palace in London, Knole House in Kent, and Old Royal Naval College at Greenwich. Interiors were shot at London's Pinewood Studios, and a replica of an 18th-century London street {{was built on the}} backlot alongside the soundstages. The producers also considered using New Orleans as a location. In October, security was breached at the UK site when a celebrity impersonator gained access to filming at the Old Royal Naval College by dressing up as Captain Jack.|$|E
5|$|The Magazine of Natural History of 1829 {{expressed}} surprise <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> {{interval between}} the first and second editions, surmising that there were too few scientific readers in France, apart from those in Paris itself; it notes that while the first volume was little changed, the treatment of fish was considerably altered in volume II, while the section on the Articulata was greatly enlarged (to two volumes, IV and V) and written by M. Latreille. It also expressed the hope that there would be an English equivalent of Cuvier's work, given the popularity of natural history resulting from the works of Thomas Bewick (A History of British Birds 1797–1804) and George Montagu (Ornithological Dictionary, 1802). The same review covers Félix Édouard Guérin-Méneville's Iconographie du Règne Animal de M. le Baron Cuvier, which offered illustrations of all Cuvier's genera (except for the birds).|$|E
5|$|In reply, the Royals {{lost its}} first batsman as N. Patel went out after scoring two runs in 11 balls. Manpreet Gony bowled a full length ball outside the off stump, which hit the leg stump after getting an inside edge as N. Patel opted to pull it. He {{went out in}} the first ball of the fourth over, leaving his team at 19 runs with loss of one wicket. The Royals lost its second opener when Raina caught Asnodkar as he hit a full and wide ball by Morkel to point. He made 28 runs facing 20 balls. In the same over, Makhaya Ntini ran out Akmal with a direct hit. Akmal played the ball to mid-on, but Ntini glided {{downwards}} and threw the ball at the stumps. After the fall of Akmal's wicket, Watson and Pathan started playing more aggressively, and scored 65 runs for a fourth wicket partnership at a run rate of 8.66; this was also the highest partnership of the match. In the eleventh over, Raina dropped Pathan on Murlitharan at deep midwicket. At the end of the thirteenth over, the Royals reached a score of 100 runs. In the fifteenth over, Muralitharan broke the partnership as he bowled Watson; the ball hit the leg stump. The next wicket was of Kaif, who was caught by Dhoni on Muralitharan. Kaif pushed a flat doosra, and Dhoni took a simple catch at cover. In the next ball, Jadeja went out for a golden duck. Morkel bowled a short ball, and Jadeja tried to pull it. However the ball went to mid-on, and Kapugedera caught the ball after running towards his left. In the same over, Raina ran out Pathan with a direct hit at the stumps. Morkel bowled a full ball which was pushed by Warne to point. He ran for a single, but Raina hit the stumps, running out off-striker Pathan. Pathan went out scoring a half-century; he made 56 runs out off 39 balls with a strike rate of 143.58 and hit three fours and four sixes. The Royals needed 18 runs {{at the end of the}} eighteenth over. The second last over was bowled by Ntini, in which he gave up ten runs. In the last ball of the over, Ntini bowled a good length ball, and Warne hit a four by Warne at cover. In the last over, the Royals required eight runs, and Dhoni gave the ball to Lakshmipathy Balaji. Six runs were required from the last three balls, but Balaji bowled a wide outside off stump, which was missed by the wicket-keeper P. Patel. This resulted in two extra runs. In the next ball, Warne hit a full ball for a run. The Royals needed three runs from the last two balls. Tanvir played the fifth legal delivery of the over, which was an angling full toss. Tanvir hit the ball <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> leg, and ran two runs. The Royals needed one more run off the last ball, with Tanvir on strike; Balaji bowled him a short ball. Warne had already covered the half distance of the pitch when Tanvir hit the ball. The two batsmen ran for a single and the Royals won the match. Both of them remained not out with nine runs each. Morkel and Muralitharan got two wickets each, giving 25 and 39 runs respectively. Gony got one wicket, whereas Ntini and Balaji had none.|$|E

5000|$|By {{dawn the}} {{monitors}} had arranged themselves in three divisions off the West Deep, {{where they could}} harass German lines of communication far inland.

40|$|Birefringence {{and force}} {{produced}} by pig tracheal smooth muscles were recorded every 100 ms during electrically stimulated tetani at muscle lengths that varied 1. 5 -fold and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> peak of acetylcholine contractures <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same lengths. Isometric force was nearly <b>the</b> same <b>at</b> all lengths. Resting birefringence <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> length was 30 % {{greater than that}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> shortest length. During tetani, birefringence increased with approximately the same time course as force, rising by 20 % <b>at</b> <b>the</b> shortest length and 9 % <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> length, and continued to increase by an additional 0. 5 – 1. 5 % of the resting value for 2 – 8 s after stimulation ended and force began to fall. This late increase was greatest and more sustained at longer lengths. During contractures, birefringence increased by 25 and 18 % <b>at</b> <b>the</b> shortest and <b>longest</b> lengths, respectively. Comparison of these results with our published thick-filament densities suggests that thick-filament density increased by about 80, 72 and 50 % during contractures <b>at</b> <b>the</b> short, intermediate and long lengths, and that ∼ 35 % of birefringence in <b>the</b> resting muscle <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> length was not due to thick filaments. These findings support the hypotheses that tracheal smooth muscle adapts to longer lengths by increasing thick-filament mass and that myosin thick filaments are evanescent, dissociating partially during relaxation and reforming upon activation. The results further suggest that thick-filament formation is sufficiently rapid {{to account for the}} velocity slowing and some of the force increase observed during the rise of activation of tracheal smooth muscle...|$|R
