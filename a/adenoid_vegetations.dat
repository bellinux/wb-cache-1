The surgical treatment included insertion of ventilation tubes and adenoidectomy where there where hypertrophic adenoids. Clinical material was analyzed according to hearing threshold, hearing level, middle ear condition estimated by pure tone audiometry and tympanometry before and after treatment. Data concerning both groups were compared. The results indicated that adenoidectomy combined with the ventilation tubes facilitates secretory otitis media heeling as well as decrease of hearing impairments.

40|$|Our {{purpose was}} to {{investigate}} the role of chronic rhinosinusi-tis (CRS) and <b>adenoid</b> <b>vegetation</b> hypertrophy (AVH) in pedi-atric patients with otitis media with effusion (OME). Paranasal sinus computerized tomography scans were taken, and acoustic impedancemetry were performed in 42 patients with rhinosinusitis related symptoms nonresponsive to antibiotic therapy. There were 19 male, 23 female patients with an age range of 3 to 13 (mean 7). OME, CRS and AVH were found in 61. 9 % (26 / 42), 45. 2 % (19 / 42) and 83. 3 % (35 / 42) of the patients, respectively. CRS was found in 57. 7 % (15 / 26) and 25. 0 % (4 / 16) of the patients with and without OME [p 0. 05], respectively.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{research}} findings of the application efficiency of bacterial immunocorrector IRS 19 (Solvay Pharam, France) among children, suffering from chronic adenoiditis and hypertroc PHY <b>adenoid</b> <b>vegetations</b> of II–III degrees. The author ascertains that treatment by bacterial immunocorrector has led to quicker and more qualitative normalization of the lymphoid tissue volumes, than nasal pharynx irrigation by salines. The application of bacterial immunocorrector during chronic adenoiditis has contributed to normalization of nasopharyngeal secretion boicenosis and considerably decreased the degree of pathogenic flora dissemination. Another proof for that is reduction {{of the number of}} adenoiditis exacerbation by 2 times, duration of all the exacerbations by 3 times, as well as reduction of the disease duration. The research findings allow advising introduction of the bacterial immunocorrector into the planned seasonal programs of the annual treatment (no less than 2 – 3 times a year) of children with chronic adenoiditis.

40|$|By {{means of}} Doppler {{echocardiography}} {{there have been}} studied disturbances of intracardiac hemodynamics in 44 children aged 8 - 17 years with chronic rheumatic cardiac disease and developed mitral aortal and combined heart defects, {{as well as in}} chronic rheumatic cardiac disease without developed valvar defect. Differential approach has been defined to administration of inhibitors of angiotensin-converting factor in rheumatic heart defects: developed insufficiency of mitral and/or aortal valves II-III stage leads to remodeling of the left heart portions with developing chronic insufficiency of blood circulation, being an index for prolonged, not less than a year usage of the angiotensin-converting factor. In the presence of isolated mitral regurgitation, I stage in children with chronic rheumatic cardiac disease usage of the angiotensin-converting factor may be cancelled due to insignificant disturbances of valvar hemodynamics and a small risk of developing blood circulation insufficiency.

40|$|The {{purpose is}} the {{features}} of the immunomorphofunctional organization of the adenoids in children with pharyngeal lymphoid ring hyperplasia were defined. The study included 54 children (random sample) from 3 to 7 years examined for the pharyngeal tonsil hypertrophy. Among the 54 selected children, there were 28 (52 %) boys and 26 (48 %) girls. The cause for surgical removal of the adenoids was the ineffectiveness of conservative therapy. The materials for morphological studies were adenoids of children obtained after adenoidectomy. When analyzing the anamnesis of 54 children with <b>adenoid</b> <b>vegetations</b> aged 3 to 7 years, it was found that among patients with this pathology, those aged 4 – 6 years predominated. The degree of hypertrophy of the pharyngeal tonsil was the highest among preschool children.

The occurence of allergies was confirmed among 104 children and occurence of recidivial otitid among 152 children. The most prevalent was respiratory alergy in 35, 6 % of the children and atopic eczema in 24 % of the children. The most common allergen was pollen in 52 %. Recurring secretorial otitid was present in 152 children, that is in 50. 8 % {{of the total number of}} children. Current occurence of allergies and secretorial otitid was confirmed in 17 % of children. On the whole allergies were found to be more prevalent in boys.

40|$|In maxillary {{sinusitis}} pathogenesis researchers {{paid much}} attention to the role of paranasal sinuses, sinus drainage dysfunctions, mucocyliary transport system disorders in cases of damage of sinuses mucous membranes. Pathohistological, immunohistochemical and morphometric studies of mucosa were conducted. However, to evaluate the local inflammatory response in cases of chronic sinusitis and improvement of individual therapy for the patients, the immunohistochemical studies of the composition of inflammatory immunocyte infiltrates of paranasal sinus mucosa and <b>adenoid</b> <b>vegetations</b> bioptate would be reasonable. The aim of the research was to study the immunohistochemical content of immunocyte infiltrates of paranasal sinuses adenomatous polyps in biopsy samples of patients suffering from chronic sinusitis. Materials and Methods. Paranasal sinuses adenomatous polyps removed during surgery of 22 patients suffering from chronic maxillary sinusitis were studied. Immunohistochemical studies of paraffin sections of the removed polyps were performed using appropriate primary antibodies and visualization systems DAKO EnVision+ System (DAKO, Denmark). Results. During microscopic investigation of paranasal sinuses adenomatous polyps of the patients suffering from chronic sinusitis, moderate and severe immunocyte infiltration of polyp stroma sometimes with focal follicular structures was presented. Immunohistochemical investigation of the cellular composition of these infiltrates proved the presence of CD 8 + T-killer cells, CD 4 + T-helper cells, CD 68 + macrophages as well as single plasma cells. The irregularity of these cells markers expression was determined in dependence of the severity of inflammatory cell infiltration. Conclusions. In the patients with chronic maxillary polyp sinusitis with mild and moderate immunocyte infiltration of paranasal sinus mucosa, among immune cells the CD 4 + T-lymphocytes occupied the most relative area in polyp stroma, plasma cells – the least (р < 0. 001). In the patients with significant immunocellular infiltration in immunocyte follicular infiltration of polyp stroma the relative area of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-lymphocytes significantly exceeded the relative area of macrophages and plasma cells. ...|$|E
40|$|Otitis {{media with}} {{effusion}} (OME) {{is the most}} common chronic disease in childhood and the most common reason for hearing loss, which happens at a time, in which the acquisition of language is an important factor for the mental development. Essential for the pathogenesis of OME is a dysfunction of the Eustachian tube, which is often caused by a hyperplasia of the tonsilla pharyngea (so-called adenoids), which obstruct the nasopharyngeal tube aperture. Surgical intervention is indicated, when the disease persist for more than two months and hearing is impaired. The operation aims at curing the disease by enabling ventilation of the middle ear. Surgical concepts include paracentesis (PC), ventilation tubes (VT), adenectomy, tonsillotomy and tonsillectomy. This is a retrospective study which examines, based on the patients' records and a questionnaire, the influence of typical factors made responsible for OME. Furthermore, the results of the different therapeutic options were compared and possible influencing factors on the post-operative result were analysed. 290 patients (38. 3 % females, 61. 7 % males, mean age 4. 1 years) were included in this study. In 150 out of these cases, we received completed questionnaires, which enabled the evaluation of the post-operative course. In detail, four questions could be drafted, which could be answered as follows: 1. How was the conformity between pre-operative and intra-operative diagnosis? Otoscopy within the scope of the clinical examination was an inaccurate method for the detection of middle ear effusion in children between one and twelve years of age. Tympanometry reached a sensitivity of 92 % and a specificity of 60 % for the diagnosis of effusion, when performed no longer than 14 days prior to operation. The results of pre-operative audiometry were in good concordance with intra-operative presence or absence of effusion (sensitivity 96 %, specificity 73 %) when performed no longer than 14 days prior to operation. 2. Which constellations/diagnostic findings were associated with OME? Associated with OME were the age between one and six years, male gender and a hyperplastic tonsilla pharyngea. There was no seasonable accumulation of the disease. 3. What statements can be made about the post-operative course and the relapse rate? Out of 150 patients, from whom data of the post-operative course were available, 62 % (n= 91) were free of relapse after a mean time of 28 months. VTs were in situ for 10. 6 months on average. Otorrhea out of VTs occurred in 21 % after four months on average. 23 % (n= 35) of the patients developed anew auricular disturbances and were treated with antibiotics. 12 % (n= 18) underwent revision surgery. The mean time to relapse was 8. 9 months. 4. Which factors had an influence on the post-operative course and the relapse rate? The patients' age and gender as well as the season, in which the surgery was performed, had no significant influence of the post-operative course. Patients with large <b>adenoid</b> <b>vegetations</b> suffered significantly (p= 0. 025) more frequent from post-operative disturbances; however, revision surgery was not required more often among these patients. The size of the tonsilla palatina had no influence on the post-operative outcome. The intra-operative presence or absence of effusion had no influence of the post-operative outcome. In cases with effusion, the consistency of the secretion had significant influence on the occurrence of post-operative disturbances (p= 0. 031 for patients with PC, p= 0. 041 for patients with VTs) but not on the frequency of revision surgery. Ears with VTs showed slightly but insignificantly less frequent post-operative disturbances than ears with PC only. The mean time between surgery and relapse was marginally longer on ears with VT (9. 2 months) than on ears with PC (8. 6 months). Patients with additional tonsillotomy or tonsillectomy tended insignificantly to less post-operative auricular disturbances and needed insignificantly less revision surgeries...|$|E
40|$|Objective: In this study, we {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the detection rate of histopathologically confirmed actinomycosis in tonsillectomized cases, during a 19 -year period. A case with actinomycosis in a rare localization such as the tongue root is also reported and, in this case, our diagnosis and treatment approach is overviewed with the literature. Methods: 1047 patients who underwent tonsillectomy for various reasons between January 1990 and December 2009 in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Faculty of Medicine, Cumhuriyet University were investigated retrospectively. The surgical materials of 115 (11 %) cases with suspicious macroscopic appearance of tonsillar tissue, unilateral tonsillar hypertrophy and suspected malignancy on clinical examination were evaluated histopathologically. Results: In this study, 66 (57. 4 %) cases were male and 49 (42. 6 %) female. A chronic granulomatous process and colonies of actinomycetes were reported pathologically in 32 (27. 8 %) cases and a chronic inflammatory process in 83 (72. 2 %) cases. Conclusions: Despite the medical and economic burden, all surgical specimens obtained from cases who underwent tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy should be examined histopathologically as well as specimens from patients with suspected malignancy. We think that this clinical approach will contribute not only to make an early diagnosis and to determine the frequency of tonsillar cancers that are rarely seen in childhood, but also to determine the role of actinomycosis in the etiology of chronic tonsillitis and <b>adenoid</b> <b>vegetation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abnormalities of dentofacial {{system in}} {{children}} and adolescents take one of the first places among the diseases of the dentofacial area. Dentofacial system disorders occur from 60 % to 90 % of cases in comorbidities of other body systems, especially ENT pathologies. Respiratory dysfunction and mouth breathing as a result belong to the most important etiological factors of dental arch narrowing. Difficulty in nasal breathing or “nasal obstruction” is a leading syndrome in rhinology. Being a manifestation of different diseases, chronic nasal breathing difficulties can give rise to similar changes in the body regardless of their causes. Frequent chronic obstructive abnormalities of the nose and throat include nasal septum deformation, chronic sinusitis, chronic rhinitis, adenoids, hypertrophia of palatine tonsils and others. Pathologies that influence the development of nasofrontal appendices of upper jaw, front part of maxillary arch and upper nasal passages often cause dentofacial deformations. Such pathologies include allergic reaction of nasopharynx and adenoids, hypertrophia of palatine tonsils, choanal atresia, hypertrophic rhinitis, etc. There is a correlation between mouth breathing and jaw abnormalities. “Pure nasal septum deformation”, i. e. without other “obstructive” pathologies of nose and pharynx, was observed in 8 children (11. 4 % of cases) out of 70 patients. Combined pathology leading to the nose and pharynx obstruction was found in other 62 cases (88. 6 %). Thus, nasal septum deformation often combined with chronic purulent rhinosinusitis in 53 children (76 %), hypertrophia of palatine tonsils in 5 patients (7. 1 %), <b>adenoid</b> <b>vegetation</b> in 8 cases (11. 3 %) and hypertrophic rhinitis in 4 children (5. 7 %). Chronic purulent maxilloethmoidal sinusitis prevailed among chronic rhinosinusitis. Appropriate surgeries were simultaneously performed in other obstructive pathologies. Therefore, the impact of nose septum deformation {{on the development of the}} child’s body as a whole and the dentofacial system in particular is still underexplored. There is still no consensus on the influence of the nasal septum deformation on the growth and development of the dentofacial system and the appearance of dentofacial abnormalities. Frequency, types and pathogenesis of dentofacial abnormalities in children with nasal septum deformation require proper investigation. ...|$|R

Todas se submeteram à mesma rotina de exame, feito na própria escola, sem a necessidade de contenção ou qualquer tipo de sedação. RESULTADOS: As crianças que foram submetidas a avaliação nasofibroscópica aceitaram bem o procedimento, permitindo a adequada avaliação das cavidades do nariz e nasofaringe. A prevalência de hipertrofia adenoideana grau I foi de 50, 6 %, a de grau II foi de 35, 1 % e a de grau III foi de 14, 3 %. As hipertrofias adenoideanas graus II e III apresentam maior número de sintomas obstrutivos. CONCLUSÃO: A videonasofaringoscopia flexível pode ser realizada, com excelente aceitação, fora do ambiente hospitalar ou consultório, como mostra este estudo realizado em ambiente escolar, indicando que sua utilização pode ser mais ampla, tornando-a mais acessível a um maior número de pessoas. A prevalência dos três graus de hipertrofia adenoideana encontrada em Aracaju difere de alguns estudos por ter sido realizada em crianças não triadas para sintomas respiratórios. OBJECTIVE: To verify children's {{acceptance of}} nasal fiber optic examination {{in a school}} setting and to evaluate hypertrophy of <b>adenoid</b> <b>vegetation</b> and to determine its prevalence in this population. METHODS: A survey was performed of a representative (n = 368) sample of school age children at elementary school (aged 6 to 13 years old) who had been subjected to fiber optic examination, in Aracaju (SE), Brazil. All students were subjected to the same study protocol, carried out at school and with no need for sedation or restraint. RESULTS: All of the children tolerated the nasal fiber optic examination well, making possible a good evaluation of pharynx and nasal cavities. The prevalence of adenoid hypertrophy grade I was 50. 6 %, of grade II 35. 1 % and of grade III 14. 3 %. Grades II and III hypertrophy were related {{to an increase in}} obstructive symptoms. CONCLUSION: As this study performed in a school setting demonstrates, nasal fiber optic examination can be performed with excellent tolerance in settings other than hospitals and outpatient clinics, indicating that its usage could be increased and made available for an extended range of populations. The prevalence of adenoid hypertrophy in Aracaju is not comparable with prevalence rates observed in earlier studies because it this was a study of children without respiratory symptoms...|$|R
