Sarawak Shell Berhad (upstream business) and Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd have their offices based in Miri. Other multinational oil <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> companies also set up their offices here, including Nippon Oil, Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, Halliburton, Technip, Ranhill WorleyParsons, and Petra Resources Sdn Bhd. In 1989, Asam Paya Oilfield was discovered in Sarawak inland areas. In 2010, Petronas discovered two oil fields offshore between Bintulu and Miri. In 2011, new underground reserves of oil <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> deposits were discovered by Nippon Oil in an inland region near Miri, Sarawak.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An {{inhalation}} exposure system, {{consisting of}} an inhalation chamber and an generating and feeding device for welding fumes <b>and</b> <b>gases</b> with a welding robot, was constructed and examined for {{its application to}} experimental toxicology for ventilatory responses of conscious rats to welding fumes <b>and</b> <b>gases.</b> The exposure system allowed an inhalation of fresh welding fumes <b>and</b> <b>gases,</b> <b>and</b> could supply airflow containing stable concentrations of fumes and ozone even the levels exceeding those corresponding occupational exposure limit values were supplied into the exposure chamber. The air temperature in the chamber was kept constant under rat’s physiological conditions. Rats were exposed to fresh welding fumes <b>and</b> <b>gases</b> <b>and</b> examined for their ventilatory responses with a body plethysmograph in the chamber. A transient increase in breathing frequency with a concomitant decrease in the tidal volume was observed within several minutes immediately {{after the start of}} welding operation. The rapid, shallow breathing response disappears after repeated exposures, indicating rapid adaptation of this ventilatory response to inhalation of welding fumes <b>and</b> <b>gases...</b>|$|R

40|$|The primary {{determinants}} of pulmonary disease are environmental. The same thinness and delicacy of the air-blood barrier which allows rapid exchange of oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} also reduce its effectiveness {{as a barrier to}} inhaled allergens, carcinogens, toxic particles, <b>and</b> noxious <b>gases,</b> <b>and</b> micro-organisms. Adults breath 10, 000 to 20, 000 liters of air daily. This volume of air contains potentially hazardous contaminating particles <b>and</b> <b>gases.</b> Future research should explore the diverse physiological mechanisms which prevent the accumulation and deleterious action of inhaled particles <b>and</b> <b>gases.</b> Since most pulmonary diseases are either initiated by or at least aggravated by the inhalagion of particles <b>and</b> <b>gases,</b> the role of environmental factors in the development of respiratory disease is an area worthy of continued support...|$|R

5|$|An {{active galaxy}} is a {{formation}} that emits {{a significant amount}} of its energy from a source other than its stars, dust <b>and</b> <b>gas.</b> It is powered by a compact region at the core, thought to be a super-massive black hole that is emitting radiation from in-falling material.|$|E

In addition to the presence of several planetesimal belts and cometary activity, there are indications that planets have formed within this disk and that the processes of planet formation may still be ongoing.

5|$|Fluor diversified its {{business}} more extensively in 1967, when five companies were merged into a division called Coral Drilling {{and it started}} a deep-water oil exploration business in Houston called Deep Oil Technology. It also created Fluor Ocean Services in Houston in 1968 and acquired an interest in other fossil fuel operations in the 1970s. Fluor acquired a construction company, Pike Corp. of America and the engineering division of its prior partner in Australia, Utah Construction. In 1972, Fluor bought land in Irvine, California and started building its new headquarters on it. The following year, the company's oil <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> operations were consolidated under a new entity, Fluor Oil <b>and</b> <b>Gas</b> Corp.|$|E
5|$|Fluor {{was founded}} in 1912 by John Simon Fluor as Fluor Construction Company. It grew quickly, {{predominantly}} by building oil refineries, pipelines and other facilities for the oil <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> industry, at first in California, {{and then in the}} Middle East and globally. In the late 1960s, it began diversifying into oil drilling, coal mining and other raw materials like lead. A global recession in the oil <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> industry and losses from its mining operation led to restructuring and layoffs in the 1980s. Fluor sold its oil operations and diversified its construction work into a broader range of services and industries.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, total Scottish exports (excluding intra-UK trade) were {{estimated}} to be £27.5billion. Scotland's primary exports include whisky, electronics and financial services. The United States, Netherlands, Germany, France and Norway constitute the country's major export markets. Scotland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), including oil <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> produced in Scottish waters, was estimated at £150 billion for the calendar year 2012. If Scotland became independent, it would hold 95% of the UK's current oil <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> reserves if they were split geographically using a median line from the English-Scottish border. If the reserves were split by population, that figure would be reduced to 9%.|$|E
