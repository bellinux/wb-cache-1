5|$|Both yes–no {{questions}} and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (<b>Am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> tomorrow?, Where can we eat?), which may require do-support (Do you like her?, Where did he go?). In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) {{appear in a}} fronted position. For example, in the question What did you see?, the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose house did you go last night?. The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.|$|E

Referring to this and similar {{examples}} where Harrison placed his overlooked songs with other recording artists, Ken Scott has refuted the idea that he lacked confidence as a songwriter in the Beatles, saying: [...] "I think he was totally confident about the songs.

500|$|Quatermass 2 {{received}} mixed reviews. Campbell Dixon in The Daily Telegraph {{found the}} film “all good grisly fun, {{if this is}} the sort of thing you enjoy”. The reviewer in The Times remarked that “the writer of the original story, Mr Nigel Kneale, and the director, Mr Val Guest, between them keep things moving at the right speed, without digressions. The film has an air of respect for the issues touched on, and this impression is confirmed by the acting generally”. On the other hand, Jympson Harman of the London Evening News wrote: “Science-fiction hokum can be convincing, exciting or just plain laughable. Quatermass II [...] fails on all these scores, I am afraid”. Similarly, the reviewer in the Daily Herald felt “The whole thing is daft and full of stilted dialogue. [...] At the end a detective says: “How <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> to make a report on all this?” I felt the same way”.|$|E

500|$|Hillenburg {{used some}} {{character}} designs from his comic book. He designed [...] "SpongeBob's grumpy next door neighbor" [...] as an octopus because the species' large head; octopi, he said, [...] "have {{such a large}} bulbous head and Squidward thinks he's an intellectual so of course, he's gonna have a large bulbous head." [...] Hillenburg drew Squidward with six tentacles because [...] "it was really just simpler for animation to draw him with six legs instead of eight". Show writer and storyboard artist Vincent Waller said: Squidward is hard to drawhe has a very odd-shaped head. Fortunately, his emotions are pretty even, but to get {{a whole lot of}} big emoting out of him is a challenge. His nose splits everything in half, so it's always like, 'OK, how <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> to work this and still make it read?' Hillenburg thought of making jokes with Squidward ejecting ink but retired it because, according to him, [...] "it always looks like he's pooping his pants".

500|$|According to folk {{tradition}} Marko never died; he {{lives on in}} a cave, in a moss-covered den or in an unknown land. A Serbian legend recounts that Marko once fought a battle in which so many men were killed that the soldiers (and their horses) swam in blood. He lifted his hands towards heaven and said, [...] "Oh God, what <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> to do now?" [...] God took pity on Marko, transporting him and Šarac to a cave (where Marko stuck his sabre into a rock and fell asleep). There is moss in the cave; Šarac eats it bit by bit, while the sabre slowly emerges from the rock. When it falls {{on the ground and}} Šarac finishes the moss, Marko will awaken and reenter the world. Some allegedly saw him after descending into a deep pit, where he lived in a large house in front of which Šarac was seen. Others saw him in a faraway land, living in a cave. According to Macedonian tradition Marko drank [...] "eagle's water", which made him immortal; he is with Elijah in heaven.|$|E
500|$|AllMusic's Jose F. Promis, {{wrote that}} [...] "the song finds Madonna giving an {{understated}} and inspired performance [...] One hopes that this overlooked gem might {{find its way}} onto future [...] hits collections, because it is truly a wonderful song". Author Thomas S. Hischak called it [...] "plaintive". Billboards Geoff Burpee [...] called it [...] "A sterling, intimate moment from the Evita soundtrack. Yes kids, she [...] can sing". Writing for Los Angeles Times, David Gritten opined Madonna's voice sounded [...] "pitch-perfect and clear as a bell". Greg Morago, from the Hartford Courant, felt that [...] "By giving her 'Another Suitcase' with its heartbreaking 'Where <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> to?' refrain, Madonna adds a necessary, fragile vulnerability to her ambitious, rags- to-riches Eva Peron". Neil Strauss from The Herald Journal, said that [...] "Madonna radiates on 'Another Suitcase in Another Hall'". Peter Keough, from the Boston Phoenix, described the track as [...] "a poignant, winsome exploration of pathos, defilement, and resolution sung by a young, struggling Eva forced into prostitution {{with a series of}} drab johns".|$|E
500|$|Dickson {{recalled}} {{that during the}} recording sessions, Webber asked her to sing in a higher range than her usual, since the [...] "mistress" [...] character was a teenager, and should have sounded younger. Before the sequence of the eviction of the mistress occurs in Act I of the musical, Eva's character sings the song [...] "Hello and goodbye" [...] and then [...] "Another Suitcase in Another Hall" [...] begins. A soft strummed guitar in broken chord patterns heralds the introductory music. Dickson sings the opening verse, and the chorus which is repeated twice as she asks, [...] "So, what happens now?" [...] and wonders about her immediate future, ultimately concluding that she would survive. For the second verse, the lyrics reflect on this recurring pattern of being evicted out of men's lives, and the final verses have a more positive outlook toward's the subject's life. The song finishes with the mistress asking the question, [...] "Where <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> to?" [...] as a male voice pacifies by saying, [...] "Don't ask, anymore".

500|$|The writers for {{the season}} worked in Los Angeles, with {{one member of the}} writing team on set in New York for filming. Actress Carrie-Anne Moss talked about how the scripts {{developed}} through the production of the season, explaining that the dialogue usually did not change much while filming, but scenes were altered to accommodate the filming locations when necessary. Rosenberg stated that, since Jones is a private investigator, there would be some procedural elements to the show, [...] "but that’s not our focus. There are cases. In particular, there is a large case that carries over the season." [...] Elaborating on this, Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb said that the [...] "fun about being a private detective is that the line between what’s legal and what’s not legal gets very blurred....her drive is not always necessarily to solve the case, {{as much as it is}} to go, 'Okay, can I pay the rent? How <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> to get through this day?'"

[...] He noted that this would not be as much of an issue if characters were making very minor cameo appearances, but explained that Marvel was not interested in cameos and easter eggs just for the sake of fan service, which could detract from the story being told; [...] "As I often get reported by you folks for saying #ItsAllConnected, our feeling is that the connection isn't just whether or not somebody is walking into a movie or walking out of a television show. It's connected in the way that the shows come from the same place, that they are real, that they are grounded." [...] Eric Carroll, producer on , felt with the introduction of Queens-based Spider-Man to the MCU it [...] "would be really fun" [...] to make mention of the Defenders based in Manhattan, adding, [...] "it’s definitely a card I would love to see played, if not sooner rather than later." ...|$|E

[...] Additionally, On July 16, 2010, Fiasco released his rock side-project Japanese Cartoon's debut EP In The Jaws of the Lords of Death. Japanese Cartoon was influenced by a variety of musical genres, with Fiasco saying, [...] "I've always been a fan of all music...Hip hop is just something I actually know how to do but I always had aspirations to participate in other forms of music. Once I got to create some hip hop, it was like, 'Okay, what <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> to do now?' So my artistic side was like, 'Yo, let's do some rock music.'" ...|$|E
