25|$|The {{vehicle is}} {{connected}} {{directly to the}} electrical network via specific socket <b>and</b> <b>plug</b> and a dedicated circuit. A control and protection function is also installed permanently in the installation. This is the only charging mode that meets the applicable standards regulating electrical installations. It also allows loadshedding so that electrical household appliances can be operated during vehicle charging or on the contrary optimise the electric vehicle charging time.|$|E

25|$|With a storm {{continuing}} to blow on the 9th, {{the crew was}} able to lower the level {{of water in the}} hold <b>and</b> <b>plug</b> some of the holes and leaks. Bailing out water using a large improvised canvas bag continued from the 9th to the 13th and succeeded in maintaining the level of water in the hold below three feet. On the 13th they were again hit by a storm and cross seas and had to bail all night. On the 14th, heavy seas disabled the rudder. By the afternoon of 15 December, the Destroyer was to the southwest of Puerto Rico, heading for Martinique, and still weathering storms.|$|E
25|$|Plugs and sockets for {{portable}} appliances started becoming {{available in the}} 1880s, to replace connections to light sockets with easier to use wall-mounted outlets. A proliferation of types developed to address the issues of convenience and protection from electric shock. Today there are approximately 20 types in common use around the world, and many obsolete socket types are still found in older buildings. Co-ordination of technical standards has allowed some types of plugs to be used over wide regions to facilitate trade in electrical appliances, and {{for the convenience of}} travellers and consumers of imported electrical goods. Some multi-standard sockets allow use of several different types of plugs; improvised or unapproved adaptors between incompatible sockets and plugs may not provide the full safety and performance of an approved socket <b>and</b> <b>plug</b> combination.|$|E
25|$|A unique {{example is}} the Soviet S4M pistol, {{designed}} to be used expressly {{for the purpose of}} assassination. It was a simple break-open, two-shot derringer, but the unique features came from its specialized ammunition, designed around a cut-down version of the 7.62mm rounds used in the Soviet AK-47. The casings of the round contained a piston-like plunger between the bullet and the powder that would move forward inside the casing when fired. The piston would push the round down the barrel <b>and</b> <b>plug</b> the end of the casing, completely sealing off any explosive gases in the casing. This, combined with the inherently low-velocity round resulted in a truly silent pistol. The nature of the gun and ammunition led to it being wildly inaccurate outside of point-blank range. To add further confusion and throw possible suspicion away from the assassin, the barrel rifling was designed to affect the bullet {{in such a way that}} ballistics experts would not only conclude that the round was fired from an AK-47, but that the round was fired from several hundred feet away. Due to the politically devastating nature inherent in this design, the S4M was kept highly secret. Information on the pistol was not known by western governments until well after the end of the Cold War.|$|E

25|$|A {{patent for}} this {{obsolete}} American <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> socket was filed in 1915 under US patent 1,179,728.

Stop buttons are only available at the doors; this has been chosen to speed alighting times. Between the seats there is a minimum width of , which allows wheelchair and buggy access along {{the full length of}} the car. All stations are announced visually and orally. The trams have wireless Internet access.|$|E
500|$|Bethesda Softworks {{started working}} on Fallout 3 in July 2004, but {{principal}} development did not begin until after [...] and its related extras <b>and</b> <b>plug</b> ins were completed. Bethesda Softworks decided to make Fallout 3 similar to the previous two games, focusing upon non-linear gameplay, story, and black comedy. Bethesda also chose to pursue an ESRB rating of M (for mature) by including the adult themes, violence, and depravity characteristic of the Fallout series. They also decided {{to shy away from}} the self-referential gags of the game's predecessors that broke the illusion that the world of Fallout is real. Fallout 3 uses a version of the same Gamebryo engine as Oblivion, and was developed by the team responsible for that game. Liam Neeson was cast as the voice of the player's father.|$|E
500|$|Watership Downs {{universal}} motifs {{of liberation}} and self-determination {{have led to}} the tendency of minority groups to read their own narrative into the novel, despite the author's assurance (in 2005) that it [...] "was never intended to become some sort of allegory or parable." [...] Rachel Kadish, reflecting on her own superimposition of the founding of Israel onto Watership Down, has remarked [...] "Turns out plenty of other people have seen their histories in that book...some people see it as an allegory for struggles against the Cold War, fascism, extremism...a protest against materialism, against the corporate state. [...] Watership Down can be Ireland after the famine, Rwanda after the massacres." [...] Kadish has praised both the fantasy genre and Watership Down for its [...] "motifs [...] hit home in every culture...all passersby are welcome to bring their own subplots <b>and</b> <b>plug</b> into the archetype." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Armstrong breech loaders used a {{vertical}} sliding block, called a vent-piece, {{which had a}} conical copper-ringed plug on its front surface which sealed the firing chamber, to close the breech. To hold both block <b>and</b> <b>plug</b> tightly in place the guns used a hollow breech screw (hence the name [...] "screw breech") behind the block, which the gunner rotated to tighten and seal the breech before firing.|$|E

2500|$|Colossus {{included}} {{the first ever}} use of shift registers and systolic arrays, enabling five simultaneous tests, each involving up to 100 Boolean calculations, {{on each of the}} five channels on the punched tape (although in normal operation only one or two channels were examined in any run). Initially Colossus was only used to determine the initial wheel positions used for a particular message (termed wheel setting). [...] The Mark 2 included mechanisms intended to help determine pin patterns (wheel breaking). Both models were programmable using switches <b>and</b> <b>plug</b> panels in a way their predecessors had not been.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1963, Dick Monnich, Jack Griffith, and Griffith's race {{mechanic}} George Clark {{finished the}} prototype Griffith, created by swapping a Ford 289 V8 into a Grantura Mk3. The accelerative {{performance of the}} car exceeded expectations, although the brakes and chassis had been left unmodified and, by all accounts, were woefully inadequate when matched with the large engine. In {{a short period of}} time, David Hives at the Hoo Hill TVR factory built a second prototype that was better developed and better finished, as well as three engine-less cars destined for Griffith's business in New York. In March 1964, David Hives went to Long Island to assist Bob Cumberford in building a pattern <b>and</b> <b>plug</b> for the Griffith 600 series, and he also helped set up the production line with George Clark. Hives helped build the [...] "tartan car" [...] that was displayed at the International Automobile Show in New York, which he and Dick Monnich attended. After this, the Griffith factory established in Syosset, Long Island began manufacturing the cars from engine-less cars imported from the Hoo Hill TVR factory.|$|E
