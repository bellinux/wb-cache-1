5|$|The two copper statues, each {{standing}} 6 feet (1.8 m) tall, flank the obelisk which {{rises to}} a masonry soldier statue, {{instead of the}} typical apex of an obelisk. The figure atop the granite obelisk is a mustached American Civil War soldier dressed in a long coat, <b>a</b> <b>cape,</b> and a cap. In the figure's right hand he holds the handle of his sword and the sword's tip rests {{in front of his}} right foot. In the soldier's left hand is a flag. Below the apex of the obelisk, on the memorial's base, are two additional sculpted figures, a Union infantry soldier and a Union cavalry soldier. The Union infantryman is dressed in a cap, long coat, and <b>a</b> <b>cape,</b> much like the figure atop the obelisk. The Union cavalryman, standing {{on the east side of}} the base, is dressed in a brimmed hat and short jacket.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Karen was the {{eleventh}} named storm and fourth hurricane of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. Karen was <b>a</b> <b>Cape</b> Verde-type hurricane that {{developed in the}} eastern tropical Atlantic out of a large tropical wave. The storm briefly reached Category 1 hurricane intensity before slowly weakening due to increased wind shear. As the storm remained away from land, no damages or fatalities were reported in association with Karen.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Sarria gave a small {{selection}} of costumes, accessories, and documents to the Oakland Museum of California—including <b>a</b> <b>cape</b> and headdress {{that he wore}} in performances of his comic version of Aida at The Black Cat. Sarria continued to own a smaller collection of art, artifacts and documentation; he had said that he expected to eventually donate those materials to the GLBT Historical Society. An article published in The Atlantic in 2011 asserted that Sarria had also donated materials to the Smithsonian Institution. This claim appears to be erroneous, as Sarria stated in 2012 that he declined the Smithsonian's request.|$|E
5000|$|There {{is also an}} in-universe term {{called the}} 'Manton effect', which states that <b>a</b> <b>cape's</b> power can very rarely affect both organic and {{inorganic}} material, and that <b>a</b> <b>cape's</b> power can very rarely affect both themselves and others. Healers cannot heal inorganic objects and powers which create or transform objects fail to target organic beings. Powers which are exempt to this rule can be particularly dangerous as they can directly alter someone's physiology.|$|R

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Cape</b> Coloured of Indian and Portuguese ancestry, D'Oliveira left South Africa {{primarily}} because the era's apartheid legislation seriously restricted his career prospects on racial grounds and barred {{him from the}} all-white Test team. He qualified for Worcestershire County Cricket Club through residency in 1964 and first played for England two years later. The consequences of D'Oliveira's possible inclusion in the 1968–69 MCC tour of South Africa were discussed by English and South African cricketing bodies as early as 1966. Manoeuvring by cricketing and political figures in both countries did little to bring the matter to a head. The MCC's priority was to maintain traditional links with South Africa and have the series go ahead without incident. South Africa's Prime Minister B.J. Vorster sought to appease international opinion by publicly indicating that D'Oliveira's inclusion would be acceptable, but secretly did all he could to prevent it.|$|E
5|$|As {{world opinion}} {{hardened}} against South Africa during the 1960s because of apartheid, international governing bodies in various sports introduced boycotts of South African teams and athletes. Until 1976, non-whites were legally {{barred from the}} South Africa cricket team, and, as the law required matches to be racially homogenous, this also applied to visiting squads. The South African government provoked overseas ire in 1968 when it refused entry to the England cricket team because its proposed tour party included Basil D'Oliveira, <b>a</b> <b>Cape</b> Coloured. Amid the ensuing scandal, Marylebone Cricket Club (which then governed English cricket) called off the tour. Two years later, a tour of England by the South Africa cricket team was cancelled by the English Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB) at a week's notice following public protests and immense pressure from the UK government. South Africa did not play another official international cricket match until 1991.|$|E
5|$|Emilia {{maintained}} peak winds {{for about}} 18hours, during which it passed about 60mi (95km) southwest of Cabo San Lazaro, which is <b>a</b> <b>cape</b> located southwest of Ciudad Constitución on the southwestern {{coast of the}} Baja California peninsula. After brushing the peninsula with its outer rainbands, Emilia {{turned away from the}} coast into cooler waters, and subsequently began to weaken rapidly. On July 27 it deteriorated into a tropical depression, and the next day Emilia degenerated into a convective-less remnant low. The low continued westward until turning northward on July 30, and on July 31 the remnants of Emilia dissipated about 495mi (800km) west-southwest of San Diego, California.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane David was an {{extremely}} deadly hurricane which caused massive devastation and loss {{of life in the}} Dominican Republic in August 1979. <b>A</b> <b>Cape</b> Verde-type hurricane that reached Category5 hurricane status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, David was the fourth named tropical cyclone, second hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 1979 Atlantic hurricane season, traversing through the Leeward Islands, Greater Antilles, and East Coast of the United States during late August and early September. David was the first hurricane to affect the Lesser Antilles since Hurricane Inez in 1966. With winds of 175mph (280km/h), David was the only storm of Category5 intensity to make landfall on the Dominican Republic in the 20th century and the deadliest since the 1930 Dominican Republic Hurricane, San Zenon, killing over 2,000people in its path. The hurricane was the deadliest Dominican tropical cyclone since a hurricane killed over 200 in September of the 1834 season.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Edouard was {{the strongest}} {{hurricane}} in the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season, reaching winds of 145mph (230km/h) on its path. Edouard remained a major hurricane for eight days, an unusually long amount of time. <b>A</b> <b>Cape</b> Verde-type hurricane, the storm formed near the coast of Africa {{in the middle of}} August. It moved westward then curved northward, and persisted until early September when it became extratropical to the southeast of New England. Edouard was originally forecast to strike the northeast United States, but it produced hurricane-force gusts to portions of southeastern Massachusetts while remaining offshore. The winds caused minor damage totaling $20million. In addition, the hurricane generated strong waves and rip currents to coastlines, killing two people in Ocean City, Md and causing numerous injuries.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Gert was {{the fourth}} of five major hurricanes in the {{moderately}} active 1999 Atlantic hurricane season. <b>A</b> <b>Cape</b> Verde-type hurricane, Gert formed on September11 {{off the coast of}} Africa before heading west-northwest. It reached a peak wind speed of 150mph (240km/h) by September15 over the open central Atlantic east-northeast of the Leeward Islands. It gradually curved to the northwest and later to the north, due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge created by Hurricane Floyd. Hurricane Gert passed east of Bermuda on September21 and began a steady weakening trend at that time. It turned to the northeast, and on September23, Gert transitioned into an extratropical cyclone to the southeast of Atlantic Canada before being absorbed by a larger storm.|$|E

5|$|Rhodes's {{pursuit of}} the {{exclusive}} mining rights in Matabeleland, Mashonaland and the surrounding areas was motivated by his wish to annex them into the British Empire {{as part of his}} personal ambition for <b>a</b> <b>Cape</b> to Cairo Railway—winning the concession would enable him to gain a royal charter from the British government for a chartered company, empowered to annex and thereafter govern the Zambezi–Limpopo watershed on Britain's behalf. He laid the groundwork for concession negotiations during early 1888 by arranging a treaty of friendship between the British and Matabele peoples and then sent Rudd's team from South Africa to obtain the rights. Rudd succeeded following a race to the Matabele capital Bulawayo against Edward Arthur Maund, a bidding-rival employed by a London-based syndicate, and after long negotiations with the king and his council of izinDuna (tribal leaders).|$|E
5|$|Shtriga is a vampiric witch in {{traditional}} Albanian folklore that sucks {{the blood of}} infants at night while they sleep, and then turns into a flying insect (traditionally a moth, fly or bee). Only the shtriga herself could cure those she had drained. The shtriga is often pictured as {{a woman with a}} hateful stare (sometimes wearing <b>a</b> <b>cape)</b> and a horribly disfigured face. The male noun for shtriga is shtrigu or shtrigan. Edith Durham recorded several methods traditionally considered effective for defending oneself from shtriga. A cross made of pig bone could be placed at the entrance of a church on Easter Sunday, rendering any shtriga inside unable to leave. They could then be captured and killed at the threshold as they vainly attempted to pass. She further recorded the story that after draining blood from a victim, the shtriga would generally go off into the woods and regurgitate it. If a silver coin were to be soaked in that blood and wrapped in cloth, it would become an amulet offering permanent protection from any shtriga.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dean was {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the most intense North Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Wilma of 2005, tying for seventh overall. Additionally, it made the third most intense Atlantic hurricane landfall. <b>A</b> <b>Cape</b> Verde-type hurricane that formed on August 13, 2007, Dean took a west-northwest path from the eastern Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lucia Channel and into the Caribbean. It strengthened into a major hurricane, reaching Category5 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale before passing just south of Jamaica on August 20. The storm made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula on August21 as a powerful Category5 storm. It crossed the peninsula and emerged into the Bay of Campeche weakened, but still a hurricane. It strengthened briefly before making a second landfall near Tecolutla in the Mexican state of Veracruz on August 22. Dean drifted to the northwest, weakening into a remnant low which dissipated uneventfully over the southwestern United States. Dean was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide of 2007 in terms of pressure, only behind Cyclone George in the Australian region, and tied with Felix as the most intense worldwide in terms of 1-minute sustained winds.|$|E
