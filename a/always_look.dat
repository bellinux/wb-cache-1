Across the world, around 20% of desert is sand, varying from only 2% in North America to 30% in Australia and over 45% in Central Asia. Where sand does occur, it is usually in large quantities in the form of sand sheets or extensive areas of dunes.|$|E

Lauren starts to suspect Max as he has become violent towards other people, but he tells her he promised {{to look after the}} real killer, who is no longer a danger. When Lauren sees Stacey dancing with Max, she accuses her of trying flirting with Max, but Stacey says they are just friends and he promised he would <b>always</b> <b>look</b> out for her. Lauren realises that Stacey is the killer and tells Max she knows this. She confronts Stacey, who confesses, and Lauren records it on her mobile phone. Lauren later hands the recording to Janine as Stacey and Ryan have begun having an affair. Max wipes the recording so on Christmas Eve, Janine publicly announces in the pub after trying to play the recording that Stacey killed Archie. Outside, Stacey privately tells Ryan that Janine is telling the truth.|$|E

25|$|One of {{widely read}} and {{translated}} {{of all his}} books is Srila Prabhupada-Lilamrta. It's a biography of {{the founder of the}} Hare Krishna movement, depicting him through different stages of his life. It was written {{with the help of a}} large research team for a period of over six years. Srila Prabhupada-lilamrta is based on material given by interviewers and researchers and is based on a system of ascertaining whether a reported biographical story is authentic.

500|$|Writing for NDTV, Anupama Chopra {{gave the}} film 2 out of 5, criticising the slow {{screenplay}} and artificial characters who [...] "are {{supposed to be}} unemployed, lonely, and desperately sad, but they <b>always</b> <b>look</b> like they've {{stepped out of the}} pages of a fashion magazine. Which could have been overlooked if there was any depth in their angst, but these two seem like spoilt kids playing suicide-suicide." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-News18 panned the film, calling it [...] "deathly boring [...] a challenge to sit through for two reasons in particular– the film has no script to speak of, and the characters are hard to sympathize with. It lacks in terms of interesting plot and consistent characterization".|$|E
500|$|Gabriel Tosh is {{a mysterious}} arms dealer and a [...] "spectre"—an elite ghost agent {{enhanced}} {{through the use}} of terrazine, a potent psionic reagent. Though originally created for Ghost, Tosh is introduced in the novel Spectres and Wings of Liberty, where he is voiced by Dave Fennoy. Metzen describes Tosh as a [...] "Boba Fett-type character" [...] while Andy Chambers feels Tosh is [...] "quasi-Rastafarian". Tosh possesses a nihilistic personality and believes that he must <b>always</b> <b>look</b> out for himself in order to survive. As such, he acts as a foil for the idealistic and honorable character of Matt Horner. Tosh represents an amoral influence on Raynor, and the temptation to cut corners and act like a pirate, although he is not inherently evil.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Thatcher criticised {{the way the}} {{decision}} to invade Iraq had been made two years previously. Although she still supported the intervention to topple Saddam Hussein, she said that (as a scientist) she would <b>always</b> <b>look</b> for [...] "facts, evidence and proof", before committing the armed forces. She celebrated her 80th birthday on 13 October at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hyde Park, London; guests included the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Princess Alexandra and Tony Blair. Lord (Geoffrey) Howe of Aberavon was also in attendance and said of Thatcher: [...] "Her real triumph was to have transformed not just one party but two, so that when Labour did eventually return, the great bulk of Thatcherism was accepted as irreversible." ...|$|E

500|$|The Indians {{were not}} expecting further trouble from the soldiers; they were {{relaxing}} and recuperating. [...] Wooden Leg attended an organised social dance {{the night before}} the battle. [...] On the day of the battle, Wooden Leg had bathed and was awoken from a nap to find the camp in a panic. The commotion was caused by US soldiers under Major Marcus Reno attacking from the south-east on the orders of Lieutenant Colonel George Custer. Wooden Leg was torn between his desire to quickly join the battle and the need to first put on his best clothes and paint his face (it was the Indian custom to <b>always</b> <b>look</b> one's best if there was any possibility of ending up in the afterlife). He was only stopped from oiling and braiding his hair as well when his father urged him to hurry.|$|E
500|$|The {{previous}} single from X, [...] "Talk", was {{a tribute}} to the German band Kraftwerk; similarly, [...] "The Hardest Part" [...] was intended by Coldplay to acknowledge American band R.E.M. When asked why the song paid {{a tribute to}} R.E.M.'s lead singer, Michael Stipe, Chris Martin said: [...] "I've lost all respect for fame, but I haven't lost all respect for respect. So the one great thing about being famous is that I get to meet people who I respect. Our relationship is akin to a dog and its master. I'll <b>always</b> <b>look</b> up to him." [...] The band felt the track resembled R.E.M.'s 1991 single, [...] "Losing My Religion". [...] "The Hardest Part" [...] was left out of the album track list when the band sent an early version of X to their record label, Parlophone, but was included when the album was finalised.|$|E
500|$|Known as {{an outspoken}} player, Hull earned a {{reputation}} {{on and off the}} ice for speaking bluntly and without regard for whom it might offend. [...] He chastised his own fans in 1992 – later backtracking – when they booed Adam Oates following Oates' trade request, calling them [...] "losers" [...] and stating he wanted to rip one particular fan's head off. Hull was a consistent critic of the NHL's defensive, [...] "clutch and grab" [...] era of the late 1990s, raising the ire of commissioner Gary Bettman in 1998 when he said [...] "I wouldn't pay to watch. It's boring. The whole style of the game is terrible. There's no flow. When a guy like [...] Lemieux leaves the game and tells you why he's leaving, and you don't address it, that's stupid.

500|$|The musical {{performances}} in this episode were mostly praised by critics, {{though there was}} little said {{about the quality of}} the abbreviated performance by the Hipsters in competition. There was near-universal approval for the first song heard, [...] "Don't Cry For Me Argentina", which Stack called [...] "totally beautiful" [...] and gave an [...] "A-"; he, like Burns, who said it was [...] "fantastic", loved having [...] "Rachel and Kurt get a chance to sing together". Jen Harper of BuddyTV echoed Kurt's words in the episode; she said [...] "Rachel really is as talented as she is irritating", but wished she [...] "didn't <b>always</b> <b>look</b> like she's crying while she's singing", and added that she was [...] "really digging Kurt in a lower register". Futterman noted that Rachel, as is usual with her [...] "power ballads", [...] "uses the time to grapple with the latest obstacle to her future stardom, while we see Kurt deliver a clear, restrained take. Benigno called Michele's voice [...] "astounding", and added that her solo alternated [...] "with Kurt's audition with the Warblers, which is predictably outstanding", and gave the song a [...] "B+". Even those who disliked the song or the composer were won over by the performance: Berk gave it three stars out of five, and Burns thought it was [...] "fantastic"; both liked the song's tag-team presentation.|$|E
500|$|The Philadelphia Inquirer and the San Jose Mercury News both {{commented on}} the {{fundamental}} problem that Springsteen seemed to be facing on the tour. [...] The former said [...] "Bruce Springsteen may well have miscalculated {{earlier this year when}} he released Working on a Dream, one of the most hopeful and downright happy sounding albums of his career just as a cratering economy was rendering the songs of struggle and strife that are his stock in trade more resonant than they have sounded in years." [...] The latter said, [...] "As Don Rumsfeld might say, you don't go on tour with the album you wish you had, you go on tour with the album you've got. So Springsteen faces the tough task of hyping a new romantic pop record while simultaneously offering hope and support to a wounded nation – not an easy task." [...] Rolling Stone voiced a similar theory. [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot wrote that [...] "If there was a disappointment, it was that Springsteen didn’t make a stronger case for his latest album, Working on a Dream. I’m not a fan of the album, but I <b>always</b> <b>look</b> forward to how the singer reinvents his studio work on the stage. In this case, however, he barely touched the new material ..." [...] Views on one, the early-in-show, eight-minute [...] "Outlaw Pete" [...] – one of the few new material centerpieces – varied considerably.|$|E
500|$|Her next {{appearance}} was in StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm, {{where she is}} the central character, and it {{tells the story of}} her further fate, and of the Zerg Swarm as well. Once again a human, Kerrigan is brought by Raynor to a secret research facility run by Valerian Mengsk to determine how much of her skill at controlling Zerg remains from her time as the Queen of Blades. However, the facility is attacked by Dominion forces and while Kerrigan and Valerian manage to escape, Raynor becomes trapped. After returning to look for him, Kerrigan hears Mengsk's announcement that he was captured and executed. To enact revenge against Mengsk, Kerrigan, while traveling through the sector to reunite the Zerg Swarm under her control, is approached by Zeratul. Zeratul tells her to travel to Zerus, the original homeworld of the Zerg, where the primal Zerg are in a constantly evolving state. Kerrigan, initially reluctant, is convinced after Zeratul tells her there she can obtain enough power to move on with her vengeance plans. On Zerus, Kerrigan learns that Amon stole {{a large portion of the}} Zerg from Zerus and bound them to a single overriding will, making them Amon's slaves as part of his plot to destroy both the Zerg and Protoss and remake life in his own image. Kerrigan enters a chrysalis in the first Zerg spawning pool and emerges, transforming again into the primal Queen of Blades. She also realizes that Amon's lingering taint was partially responsible for the crimes she committed during the Brood War. Mengsk contacts Kerrigan and reveals that Raynor was not killed, but is held as a hostage instead, threatening to kill him should she wage war against the Dominion. With help from Valerian and Raynor's Raiders, Kerrigan manages to rescue Raynor, but is rejected by him for renouncing the human self that he worked so hard to restore. Now in full control of the Zerg Swarm once again, Kerrigan launches an attack on the Dominon's main world, Korhal, to defeat Mengsk. She is assisted by Valerian, who convinces her to give an opening for the civilians to escape, and is later assisted by Raynor's forces as well. Confronting Mengsk face to face, Kerrigan is almost defeated when he uses the Xel'naga artifact to attack her, but Raynor stops him, allowing her to kill Mengsk with her own hands. Kerrigan and Raynor make their peace and it is shown that they will <b>always</b> <b>look</b> out for each other, hinting an everlasting affection between the two. With the Dominion's leader destroyed, Kerrigan bids Raynor and Valerian farewell and starts to prepare herself and her swarm for [...] "the greatest battle they'll ever face".|$|E

500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we <b>always</b> <b>look</b> for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E
