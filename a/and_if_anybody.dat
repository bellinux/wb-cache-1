When {{asked about his}} company's tax minimisation schemes, he replied: [...] "Of course I am minimising my tax. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>anybody</b> in this country doesn't minimise their tax, they want their heads read, because as a government, I can tell you you're not spending it that well {{that we should be}} donating extra!" ...|$|E
2500|$|With the {{popularity}} of the [...] "Point-a-Minute" [...] tradition at Michigan, the Detroit Free Press reported: [...] "The score is one of particularly gratification to Michigan's enthusiasts as it makes Yost's whirlwinds secure a record that never was equalled before, and probably never will be again. Michigan started out the season with as tough a schedule apparently as any team in the west, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>anybody</b> had made a break that this aggregation would be a 'point to the minute' team the man who made the assertion would have been the guy of the town. Yet now, having played 540 minutes, this scoring machine has piled up 621 points, and even if Michigan is shut out by Minnesota in seventy minutes of play the Wolverines will have obtained an average that is the greatest feat in gridiron history." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Most of {{them are}} bachelors, and tough. They've stood their own cooking so long {{that they ought to}} be, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>anybody's</b> really sick I hold off and tell him to wait until he can get a doctor. A {{sensitive}} conscience," [...] he added reflectively, [...] "is quite a handicap in this business." ...|$|R
50|$|It {{was told}} that forest angles were {{safeguarding}} because there are gold diamonds <b>and</b> platinum. <b>If</b> <b>anybody</b> enters there they will be cursed and die.|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} I have a leader. Mr. Mildmay leads our side; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>anybody</b> leads me, he does. But I have great faith in Mr. Monk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Clear out, then," [...] hissed the skipper. [...] "Go {{and send}} the mate to me. Don't hurry. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>anybody</b> noticed me come aboard and should ask you who I am, say I'm a pal of yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If she was it won't {{take very}} long to find her," [...] {{returned}} Dick. [...] "Let us go to Cedarville <b>and</b> see <b>if</b> <b>anybody</b> {{has seen the}} Falcon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So he has," [...] said Mary. [...] "And you {{are driven}} close enough {{yourself}} sometimes, Mrs. Thomas. There's days when you'd like to borrow nineteen <b>and</b> sixpence <b>if</b> <b>anybody</b> would lend it you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "we {{all know}} Lanigan Beam, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> there's <b>anybody</b> who wants {{the peace of}} the {{community}} to vanish entirely out of sight, the responsibility's on him, and not on me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sergeant," [...] he said, [...] "it {{was most}} {{a week before}} I knew, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>anybody</b> had told {{me at the time}} I'd have turned him out to freeze before I'd have let him have a horse of mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll start fair in England, Molly. I'll just be John McEachern, from America, <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>anybody</b> {{wants to}} know {{anything}} about me, I'm a man who has made money on Wall Street--and that's no lie--and has come over to England to spend it." ...|$|E
6000|$|After {{simple and}} {{pleasing}} refreshments of the wooden-plate and paper-napkin school, Gertie announced: [...] "Now we're {{going to have}} some stunts, and you're each to give one.

6000|$|... "There ain't no {{salary for}} being in Parliament. There are scores of them Parliament gents ain't got so much as'll pay their dinners for 'em. <b>And</b> then <b>if</b> <b>anybody</b> does trust 'em, there's no getting at 'em to make 'em pay as there is at other folk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{wait around}} the barn {{for a while}} <b>and</b> see <b>if</b> <b>anybody</b> comes in or goes out," [...] {{suggested}} Jack. He could not {{get it out of}} his mind how queerly the Germans had acted, and he felt certain that something was wrong and that the fellows ought to be reported to the authorities.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was quite}} dark when she woke; but a lamp was lighted near by, and {{standing}} under {{it was a}} man ringing a great bell.

6000|$|... ‘Come, that’s a good one,’ {{said the}} mayor, benevolently tapping Mr. Trott {{on the arm}} with his broad-brimmed hat; ‘I have known her, well, for a long time; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>anybody</b> could {{entertain}} the remotest doubt on the subject, I assure you I have none, nor need you have.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|She sounded hysterical to herself; she fancied that to Sam Clark {{she sounded}} insane. But he chuckled, [...] "Now you just cuddle under Sam's wing, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>anybody</b> rubbers at you too long, I'll shoo 'em off. Here we go! Watch my smoke--Sam'l, the ladies' delight and the bridegrooms' terror!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Bags,' he said laconically. 'Vest,' he added, {{doing the}} same to his other pocket.

Sure you won't come, too?' ...|$|E
60|$|He give us {{something}} to eat, and made us {{go to the}} other end of the boat, and he laid down on a locker, where he could boss all the works, and put his old pepper-box revolver under his head, <b>and</b> said <b>if</b> <b>anybody</b> come fooling around there trying to land her, he would kill him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look {{behind you}} {{now and then}} <b>and</b> tell me <b>if</b> <b>anybody</b> follows us," [...] he said, and knowing that Pete's eyes could be trusted, {{carefully}} reviewed the situation when they turned into a busy street.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, that bird," [...] {{he would}} say, [...] "is, maybe, {{two hundred years}} old, Hawkins--they live forever mostly; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>anybody's</b> seen more wickedness, {{it must be the}} devil himself. She's sailed with England, the great Cap'n England, the pirate. She's been at Madagascar, and at Malabar, and Surinam, and Providence, and Portobello. She was at the fishing up of the wrecked plate ships. It's there she learned 'Pieces of eight,' and little wonder; three hundred and fifty {{thousand}} of 'em, Hawkins! She was at the boarding of the viceroy of the Indies out of Goa, she was; and to look at her you would think she was a babby. But you smelt powder--didn't you, cap'n?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who'd have thought, a week ago, that I'd {{be sitting}} in this jolly old chair asking you to be my best man?

6000|$|... "Now," [...] said he to his companions, [...] "this pole is ours, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>anybody</b> {{ever comes}} into this sea from Russia, or Iceland, {{or any other}} place, they will find the north pole has been pre-empted."

60|$|He {{gave me a}} long {{lecture and}} a longer list of instructions. I must take air and {{exercise}} and I must become a total abstainer from sundaes of all descriptions.

But as there's no one here that can--" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had been}} engaged, I said, {{two years to}} Dora. She lived in Arthur's parish, and I loved her--yes, in those days I loved her purely, devotedly, {{innocent}}ly.

I should have been genuinely horrified <b>and</b> indignant <b>if</b> <b>anybody</b> had ventured to say that I should end by committing a murder.|$|R
60|$|At {{four o'clock}} in the morning, when we had gone to press and were having a {{relaxing}} concert as usual (for some of the printers were good singers and others good performers on the guitar and on that atrocity the accordion), the proprietor of the Union strode in <b>and</b> asked <b>if</b> <b>anybody</b> had heard anything of Boggs or the school report.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I'm {{not doing}} a thing,' Mr. Turtle said, {{speaking}} as if the tears were just ready to run down his muddy cheeks.

6000|$|... "We won't do any sneaking or hiding {{around about}} it," [...] Daylight was explaining. [...] "We'll ride around as bold if you please, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>anybody</b> sees us, why, let them. If they talk--well, {{so long as}} our consciences are {{straight}} we needn't worry. Say the word, and Bob will have on his back the happiest man alive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I'm not done," [...] he explained. [...] "I'm {{going out}} now through that window. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>anybody</b> tries to stop me, {{it will be}} his--or her--" [...] he bowed politely to Miss Trimble--"last act in the world. If any one makes a move to stop me, I shall drop this test-tube and blow the whole damned place to pieces." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Wilks nodded. [...] "I shall keep my {{eyes open}} this afternoon," [...] he said reassuringly. [...] "And if I get a chance of putting in a word it'll be put in. Twenty-nine years I sailed with the cap'n, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> there's <b>anybody</b> knows his weak spots it's me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very true, my dear; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> we knew <b>anybody</b> {{we would}} join them directly. The Skinners were here last year--I wish {{they were here}} now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'YOU know,' {{returned}} {{poor little}} Miss Podsnap. 'I think I {{should go out}} of my mind, Sophronia, with vexation and shyness <b>and</b> detestation, <b>if</b> <b>anybody</b> did. It's {{enough for me to}} see how loving you and your husband are. That's a different thing. I couldn't bear to have anything of that sort going on with myself. I should beg and pray to--to have the person taken away and trampled upon.' ...|$|R
