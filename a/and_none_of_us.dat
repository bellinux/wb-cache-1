25|$|The {{band was}} a lot of fun. I think there was great rapport between the people in it. <b>And</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> wanted to leave. We were always getting sort of offers from other bands for much more money than we were making with Woody, and it was always like if you left, you were a rat. You were really letting down the team.|$|E
2500|$|... "I've {{known about}} these ossuaries {{for many years}} and so have many other archaeologists, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> thought it was much of a story, because these are rather common Jewish names from that period. It's a {{publicity}} stunt, and it will make these guys very rich, and it will upset millions of innocent people because they don't know enough to separate fact from fiction." ...|$|E
2500|$|William G. Dever {{said that}} some of the {{inscriptions}} on the ossuaries are unclear, but that all of the names are common.

60|$|MRS KNOX. What did I tell you? Heres {{something}} out of the common happening with a servant; <b>and</b> we <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> know how to behave.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good heavens!" [...] Skinner broke in; [...] "to {{think that}} we three should have passed close to your brother <b>and</b> that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> should have {{recognized}} him! How awfully unfortunate!" ...|$|R
2500|$|We {{went through}} one of the big {{automobile}} factories to-day[...] [...] [...] The foundry interested me particularly. The heat was terrific. The men seemed weary. Here manual labor is a drudgery and toil is slavery. The men cannot possibly find any satisfaction in their work. They simply work to make a living. Their sweat and their dull pain are part of the price paid for the fine cars we all run. And most of us run the cars without knowing what price is being paid for them[...] [...] [...] We are all responsible. We all want the things which the factory produces <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> is sensitive enough to care how much in human values the efficiency of the modern factory costs.".|$|E
2500|$|The {{children}} were {{asleep in the}} berths, and I was lying awake, listening to the sounds on the boat and wondering which part of the Sound we were on. [...] Suddenly there came a signal shrill whistle from our boat, and I jumped up and looked out of the window. [...] There was a big boat, bearing directly down on us. [...] She blew four times and began to back. [...] But still she came ahead towards us, and I {{could see she was}} going to cut into us. [...] I don't know what I thought or did. [...] I watched her coming on, and it seemed as if she went slowly, but still so fast. [...] Then she ground into us, and I ran to my baby. [...] The boat broke in all the side of the room, and the sound of smashing timbers and glass with the shock of the impact almost made me sick. [...] To add to the confusion, there were the shouts of the officers and the crew. [...] The cries of my little boys and girl. [...] The {{children were}} bruised by the collision, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> were able to save any clothing or any other personal belongings.|$|E
60|$|BLANCO. No: the devil's {{gone out}} of you. We're all frauds. Theres none of us real good <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> real bad.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{remember}} her last {{when you were}} teaching her to run alone, <b>and</b> letting <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> touch her, because you said she was your child, and belonged to no one else.' ...|$|R
60|$|Then it {{came out}} as we sat over breakfast, that, with the {{exception}} <b>of</b> Arnott <b>and</b> Pirolo, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> had ever seen a corpse, or knew in what manner the spirit passes.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{very idea}} I was seeking!" [...] exclaimed Shaggy joyfully; {{and then he}} called out: [...] "Brother, put a mask over your face, <b>and</b> then <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> can see what your {{features}} are like." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{clasped her}} in his arms, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> spoke. He {{gradually}} released her, and she looked upon us, and looked up to heaven, and moved her lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "That would oblige {{one of us}} {{to watch}} in case natives or wolves should attack us, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are in a fit state to watch. We must sleep." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And turn all {{the people}} of the villages against us?' clamoured Shere Khan. 'No; give him to me. He is a man, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> can look him between the eyes.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I did that, {{trying to}} hit one of the pesky creatures," [...] {{explained}} old Uncle Randolph. [...] "We must kill them some way or they'll get all over the house, <b>and</b> then <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> will have any peace." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see. Well, all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{think it}} is {{perfectly}} dreadful the way Jennie accepts Martell's invitations. Of course, we don't want to tell on her, either in school or to her folks, <b>and</b> yet <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{think it is}} right." ...|$|R
60|$|V. Roads.--The {{familiar}} false concord is not {{certainly a}} form of colloquialism that I should feel inclined to encourage. It is very odd; I wrote it very carefully, and {{you seem to have}} read it very carefully, <b>and</b> yet <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> found it out. The Deuce is in it.|$|R
6000|$|... "We have drilled one hole, Maria, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{have got}} our fingers smashed, so I {{think we have}} every reason to be {{satisfied}} with our first experience at the work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And turn all {{the people}} of the villages against us?" [...] clamored Shere Khan. [...] "No, give him to me. He is a man, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> can look him between the eyes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He was dead--stone dead. There {{was no good}} {{doctoring}} him. We {{took him}} up and carried him into the surgeon's room, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> had the courage all that night to tell your mother.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, I {{could not}} help it. I am only so sorry we kept him away from you when you wanted him so much; {{but we did not}} know, and he was Sir Stephen's right hand, <b>and</b> we <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> knew what to do without him; but if he had only told--" ...|$|R

60|$|It {{can well}} be fancied that we moved {{with the utmost}} caution, for people do not set out on such an {{enterprise}} as we were bent upon with any great blowing <b>of</b> horns, <b>and</b> although <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> were {{what might be called}} woodsmen, I flatter myself that we did not bungle the job very badly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mighty me! Won't mis'ess {{storm and}} call us stupids {{when she comes}} back!" [...] moaned Maryann. [...] "How I wish it had {{happened}} {{when she was at}} home, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> had been answerable!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who {{will go with}} me?" [...] the {{superintendent}} asked, as a car was made ready. [...] "I don't want the married men to volunteer, for they are needed at home, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> may come back alive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But what proof {{have they}} got against her, if it IS Hetty?" [...] said Adam, still violently, {{with an effort}} that seemed to shake his whole frame. [...] "I'll not believe it. It couldn't ha' been, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> know it." ...|$|E

5000|$|Ben Elton: [...] "'A single American {{stealth bomber}} costs five hundred million American dollars, {{and they are}} going to build one hundred and twenty of them.

6000|$|... "It {{was sharp}} while it lasted," [...] the Major said; [...] "but {{we were all}} snug enough except against a stray bullet, such as that which hit poor young Richards. He behaved very gallantly, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> knew he was hit till it was all over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is reason}} in that, Rosco," [...] said Zeppa, sitting {{down on the}} ground {{by the side of the}} pirate, and leaning his back against the rock.

6000|$|Now {{under these}} circumstances, <b>and</b> {{considering}} that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> can quite set ourselves above public opinion, wouldn't a trifling concession to that opinion be--Come, sir,' said Rugg, 'I will {{put it on}} the lowest ground of argument, and say, amiable?' ...|$|R
