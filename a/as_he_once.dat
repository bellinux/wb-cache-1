5|$|Brandon, however, {{remained}} at Bradford for the 2009–10 season and he scored his first goal {{for his hometown}} club with a late goal in a 2–0 victory against his former side Torquay United in late August. The following month, his second goal for the club again came against one of Brandon's former teams, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> again came off the substitutes' bench to score in a 3–0 victory over Chesterfield. However, he continued to struggle to hold down a regular first-team place and when new manager Peter Taylor took over, Brandon {{was one of a}} number of players released early from his contract. He had played just 31 games during his two seasons with City, scoring three goals.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequel to}} Croc: Legend of the Gobbos was first teased {{on the back}} of the Sega Saturn version of the game’s manual. Initially advertised for a Christmas 1998 release,Croc 2 was {{released}} in June of 1999 for the Sony PlayStation, and later for Microsoft Windows and the Game Boy Color. A Sega Saturn release was also advertised but never released, and a Sega Dreamcast port of the game was ultimately cancelled. The game follows Croc <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> again ventures to defeat Baron Dante, who has captured an old inventor Gobbo, while simultaneously searching for his long-lost parents. The game makes numerous gameplay changes from the first game, including the addition of a health counter, more mission-based levels, and an open HUB area for navigating levels. A 2D side-scrolling port of the game for the Game Boy Color, simply titled Croc, was released in June 2000. Three mobile phone games based on the game, developed by Morpheme, were released through the mid-2000s, titled Croc Mobile: Jungle Rumble, Croc Mobile Pinball, and Croc Mobile: Volcanic Panic!.|$|E

5|$|Between 1910 and 1916, Hand {{tried to}} {{translate}} his political philosophy into political action. Having read Croly's The Promise of American Life and its anti-Jeffersonian plea for government intervention in {{economic and social}} issues, he joined the Progressive Party. However, he discovered that party politicking was incompatible not only with {{his role as a}} judge but with his philosophical objectivity. The pragmatic philosophy Hand had imbibed from William James at Harvard required each issue to be individually judged on its merits, without partiality. In contrast, political action required partisanship and a choice between values. After 1916, Hand preferred to retreat from party politics into a detached skepticism. His belief in central planning resurfaced during the 1930s in his growing approval of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> again—though this time as an observer—endorsed a program of government intervention. Hand was also an interventionist on foreign policy, supporting U.S. involvement in both world wars, and disdained isolationism.|$|E
5|$|T.C. Russell is {{the patriarch}} of the Russell family. He is {{characterized}} by his violent temper and hatred of Julian Crane for supposedly injuring him in a hit-and-run attack, and destroying his chances of becoming a professional tennis player. T.C. is initially portrayed as a harsh and unforgiving parent; he pushes Whitney to train to be a tennis champion, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> wanted to be, and disapproves of her relationship with Chad Harris-Crane, feeling it is a distraction. He is also violent with Simone when she reveals she is a lesbian. After learning about Eve's past relationship with Julian and her responsibility for the car crash that ended his tennis career, T. C. files for divorce and has a brief romance and engagement to her adoptive sister Liz Sanbourne. The show humanizes T.C. and softens his temper during his recovery from a stroke; his final storylines focus on his attempts to rebuild {{his relationship with his}} ex-wife and children. In 2007, he moves to New Orleans to help Whitney with her pregnancy and reconnect with Simone. T.C. does not appear in the show after its transition to DirecTV, and he is neither seen nor mentioned in the series finale.|$|E

In the past {{he had been able to}} “feel twilight gather” but something has changed and he’s no longer as sure <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> was. It appears that these two have been abandoned or forgotten when the populous fled the area. Sometimes he thinks he hears people and wonders if they are coming back.|$|E
25|$|The third ODI proved another {{disappointment}} for Godleman <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> again {{made it to}} {{the high}} 20s and once again got out. The fourth match proved to be his day however as he became the highest U19 run scorer for England in ODIs, passing names such as: Michael Vaughan, Alastair Cook, Nick Knight and Marcus Trescothick. He faced exactly half the balls in the innings (150 balls) and scored 149 not out, as Adam Lyth and himself took England to a massive score of 313–7.|$|E
25|$|Robson {{continued}} his international career until 1991, also helping England {{to reach the}} 1990 World Cup. For the second World Cup in succession, though, his role was limited <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> again suffered an injury in the second match (against the Netherlands) that was {{to keep him out}} {{of the rest of the}} tournament. Even more ironically, for the second World Cup in succession, England's revamped formation played better without their captain, whose place in the team was taken by David Platt during the knock-out stages as England came fourth.|$|E

25|$|Zach {{consoles}} Kendall {{while she}} worries for her best friend, Greenlee Smythe, who is pregnant with Ryan Lavery's child. Kendall has seen Ryan angrily voice {{that he never}} wants children, and she fears how Ryan will react to Greenlee's pregnancy. When Greenlee relays to Ryan that they are expecting a child, Ryan goes on an angry rampage, destroying Greenlee's hotel room, and in some time, drives his motorcycle off of a cliff. Everyone presumes Ryan is dead. However, Zach discovers him alive. When Ryan strongly reasons with Zach not to reveal to Greenlee or Kendall, or anyone that he is still alive, Zach agrees, feeling that Ryan's temper is dangerous to Greenlee. He also sees Ryan's need to start fresh, just <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> had.|$|E
25|$|However, {{aside from}} {{playing in a}} {{practice}} match, Azhar {{did not get a}} chance to participate in the World Cup and Pakistan's early exit from the tournament meant that he was once again, in line for being axed from the national squad. Following his exclusion, Azhar returned to playing county cricket in UK. Over the years, due to his constant exclusion from the Pakistani squad {{and the fact that he}} has crossed the 30-year-old mark, it seems that Mahmood is not as interested in returning to the Pakistani line up <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> was. His weight gain, mediocre performances in ODIs, combined with the tough competition for the all rounder slot in the Pakistani line up meant that his chances for making a return to the national squad were very limited. He has previously signed with the defunct Indian Cricket League (ICL) and had been released from his central contract.|$|E
25|$|Xiahou Dun {{was from}} Qiao County (譙縣), Pei State (沛國), {{which is in}} present-day Bozhou, Anhui. He was a {{descendant}} of Xiahou Ying, who served under the Han dynasty's founding emperor, Liu Bang (Emperor Gao). He was notorious for his fiery personality <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> killed a man who insulted his teacher {{when he was just}} 13 years old. In 190, when Cao Cao was raising an army to participate in the campaign against Dong Zhuo, Xiahou Dun became an officer under Cao and fought in many battles. When Cao Cao was appointed as acting General of Uplifting Martial Might (奮武將軍) by the Han imperial court, Xiahou Dun was commissioned as a Major (司馬) and was ordered to garrison at Boma (白馬; near present-day Hua County, Henan). He was later promoted to Colonel Who Breaks and Charges (折衝校尉) and was appointed as the Administrator (太守) of Dong Commandery (東郡; the areas around present-day Puyang, Henan and Liaocheng, Shandong).|$|E

25|$|Junior Seau was an American NFL player, and is {{a typical}} example of an {{individual}} with PTSD. He was born on January 19, 1969 and died on May 2, 2012. Seau was a very beneficial asset to the teams that he played for; throughout his career he played for San Diego Chargers from 1990 to 2002, Miami Dolphins from 2003–2005 and New England Patriots from 2006–2009. He played linebacker for all three teams and had extensive experience in this role, despite many injuries throughout his career. After his career at the NFL he developed differences in his personality, due to brain injury; these changes consisted of impaired self-control and regulation, sensitive emotionally and also {{he was not able}} to socialise <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> was able to, which then led to alienation, something which was a strong opposite to his original personality. From there he developed insomnia and committed suicide via a self-inflicted gunshot to his heart.|$|E
25|$|On April 8, 2013, Anthony and Minnesota's Nikola Peković {{were named}} Eastern and Western Conference Players of the Week, respectively, {{for the period}} April 1–7, 2013. Anthony led the Knicks to a 4-0 record {{as part of their}} 12-game winning streak, during which he {{averaged}} 41.8 ppg. On April 9, 2013, Anthony kept up his torrid pace <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> again scored 36 points on 13-21 FG shooting (3-4 from 3-point distance) as he became the first Knick since King to post five consecutive games of at least 35 points in a 120-99 victory over the Washington Wizards. It was also the team's 51st win, and 13th straight win, and they clinched their first Atlantic Division title since the 1993–1994 season. No NBA player had scored at least 35 points in 5 straight games since Kobe Bryant in the 2006–2007 season. In 2013, Anthony became the first Knicks player with the highest-selling jersey in the NBA, based on sales at the NBA Store and NBAstore.com, since the league started tracking jersey sales in 2001.|$|E
25|$|Among La Luz’s {{most recent}} {{achievements}} is the restoration in May 17, 2011 of public worker rights in Puerto Rico after Puerto Rico Law 45 was nullified by {{the passage of}} a new fiscal austerity Law 7 by the current Governor of Puerto Rico Luis Fortuño- a Republican- amidst one of the worst fiscal and economic recessions that Puerto Rico has endured. Law 7 effectively suspended collective agreement clauses in an effort to repress public employees and strip them of collective bargaining rights. Law 7 also caused massive layoffs in Puerto Rico of over 19,000 public sector employees and aggravated an already dismal economic unemployment rate that affected thousands of working families struggling to make ends meet. La Luz was fundamental in speaking out against the injustices by insisting on the need to restore bargaining rights for public workers. In his impassioned speech at the Labor Day celebration sponsored by the President of the PR Senate, La Luz made the case for restoration <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> again led a grassroots lobbying campaign along with other union leaders and the Senate President which resulted in the passage of Law 73 that restored the contracts that had been originally suspended by Law 7.|$|E

500|$|Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge, {{known as}} [...] in Japan, is a {{platform}} video game by Capcom for the Nintendo Game Boy.

500|$|Other {{parts of}} the story also derive from the author's life: Balzac once {{attended}} a feast held by the Marquis de Las Marismas, who planned to launch a newspaper– the same situation in which Valentin finds himself after expressing his first wish to the talisman. Later, Valentin visits the opera armed with a powerful set of glasses that allow him to observe every flaw in the women on stage (to guard against desire). These {{may also have been}} drawn from Balzac's experience, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> wrote in a letter about a set of [...] "divine" [...] opera glasses he ordered from the Paris Observatory.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{deals with}} the concept of realizing one's {{mortality}} and discovering that life is more precious because of it. [...] Learning that he is in fact not immortal <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>once</b> thought, Bender initially feels that living a life that is anything less than immortal is worthless. [...] He {{deals with the}} devastating news of his newfound mortality by trying to find the one person who he believes can answer his questions about the reason for his life and why he was allowed to [...] "be born" [...] only to die. [...] Though Bender cannot find the answers to his mortality, he ultimately ends up developing a new outlook on life, believing it to be more precious than it was before now that it is finite, and he resolves that life is worth living no matter how brief it is.|$|E
