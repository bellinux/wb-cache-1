Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.|$|E

Shortly after {{the trial of the}} Baby Bombard, Blacker was posted to other duties, and left the anti-tank weapon {{in the hands of a}} colleague in the department, Major Millis Jefferis.|$|E
5|$|Harper was {{the only}} Reform MP to support the {{creation}} of the Canadian Firearms Registry at second reading in 1995, although he later voted against it at third reading stage. He said <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> initially voted for the registry because of a poll showing that most of his constituents supported it, and added that he changed his vote when a second poll showed the opposite result. It was reported in April 1995, that some Progressive Conservatives opposed to Jean Charest's leadership wanted to remove both Charest and Manning, and unite the Reform and Progressive Conservative parties under Harper's leadership.|$|E

5|$|Some critics, {{including}} Murray Rothbard, {{have sought}} to show that Keynes had sympathy with Nazism, {{and a number of}} writers described him as antisemitic. Keynes's private letters contain portraits and descriptions, some of which can be characterized as antisemitic, others as philosemitic. Scholars have suggested that these reflect clichés current <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> accepted uncritically, rather than any racism. On several occasions Keynes used his influence to help his Jewish friends, most notably when he successfully lobbied for Ludwig Wittgenstein to be allowed residency in the United Kingdom, explicitly in order to rescue him from being deported to Nazi-occupied Austria. Keynes was a supporter of Zionism, serving on committees supporting the cause.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the current}} law {{there are two}} {{applications}} of the insanity defence; where it is claimed that the defendant was insane <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> committed the crime, {{and where it is}} claimed that he was insane {{at the time of the}} trial and thus unable to effectively defend himself. The defence is most commonly used in the Crown Court, since it was previously believed that it required a jury; in DPP v Harper , it was decided that the defence could also be applied in the Magistrates' Court.|$|E
5|$|Wallace, {{who was a}} cadet of the Officers Training Corps, was {{commissioned}} second lieutenant in the 5th Battalion, The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own) on 5 August 1914, while still an undergraduate. There were suggestions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was the first undergraduate to go into action {{but they were not}} substantiated. After two weeks' training at Sheppey, he departed for France on 30 August. There, he participated in the First Battle of the Aisne and was active on the Western Front at Frelinghien and Ploegsteert Wood.|$|E

5|$|In June 1976, Gravel was {{the focus}} of a federal {{investigation}} into allegations that he was involved in a sex-for-vote arrangement. Congressional staff clerk Elizabeth Ray (who was already the subject of a sex scandal that led to the downfall of Representative Wayne Hays) stated that in August 1972, she had sex with Gravel aboard a houseboat on the Potomac River, under the instruction of Representative Kenneth J. Gray, her boss at the time. Gray allegedly wanted to secure Gravel's support for further funding for construction of the National Visitor Center in Washington, a troubled project that was under the jurisdiction of subcommittees that both members chaired. Another Congressional staffer said she witnessed the boat encounter, but Gravel said <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had never met either of the women. Both Gravel and Gray strongly denied that they had made any arrangement regarding legislation, and neither was ever charged with any wrongdoing. Decades later, Gravel wrote that he had indeed had sex with Ray, but had not changed any votes because of it.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, Meredith {{expressed}} {{his desire to}} play for the Australia national team. Australia coach Ange Postecoglou said <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was open to selecting a number of new players to the national team, including Meredith. Meredith was first called up by Australia for a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Jordan on 8 October 2015, for which he was an unused substitute as Australia lost 2–0. Meredith debuted for Australia on 12 November 2015, after being selected in the starting line-up for the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Kyrgyzstan, which the team won 3–0 at home. He only learned he would be starting {{on the morning of the}} match, and his family flew to Canberra from Melbourne to watch him. He made a second start in a win over Bangladesh four days later.|$|E
5|$|The Amaury Sport Organisation {{announced}} the wildcard entries to the Tour de France in January, much earlier in than in past years. Cofidis, who {{had participated in}} the Tour every year of their existence, were among the four teams added to the 18 UCI ProTeams obligated to attend. After not racing the Tour in 2010 and indicating <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may not return to it, Moncoutié decided instead to ride the 2011 Tour with hopes of winning the King of the Mountains title. The decision put a bit of doubt to his potential return to the Vuelta a España, notwithstanding the team needing a wildcard for that race as well, in spite of his three-year string of winning the mountains classification at that race. Taaramäe, Dumoulin, El Fares, and Vogondy were also named to the squad.|$|E
