25|$|Amino acids from {{ingested}} {{food that}} are not used for the synthesis of proteins and other biological substances — or produced from catabolism of muscle protein — are oxidized by the body as an alternative source of energy, yielding urea and carbon dioxide. The oxidation pathway starts with {{the removal of the}} amino group by a transaminase; the amino group is then fed into the urea cycle. The first step in the conversion of amino acids from protein into metabolic waste in the liver is removal of the <b>alpha-amino</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> which results in ammonia. Because ammonia is toxic, it is excreted immediately by fish, converted into uric acid by birds, and converted into urea by mammals.|$|E

Because of the technology involved, the phytase produced by solid state fermentation is known to contain several side enzyme activities, including protease, amylase, cellulase, xylanase and beta-glucanase.

The bulls were fitted with an aortic ultrasonic blood flow probe and with catheters in the aorta and vena cava. They were offered a diet allowing for maintenance (MP) {{during a period of}} 15 d, {{at the end of which}} measurements were made over 3 d. Bulls were then given a fattening diet (FP) and the measurements were repeated. Arterial blood flow was approximately 1 L/min greater when the bulls were standing than when lying. Blood flow was 2 L/min higher during FP than during MP. The AVD and uptake of glucose were maximal at 1400 and 1600. Uptake of <b>alpha-amino</b> <b>nitrogen</b> decreased immediately after a meal. The increase in glucose from MP to FP fitted very well with the calculated energy needs for muscle growth. The AVD and uptake of <b>alpha-amino</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> total amino acids, and total nonessential amino acids were negative during MP and positive and significantly higher during FP. There was also a significant increase in AVD and uptake of essential and branched-chain amino acids when the bulls were changed from MP to FP.

40|$|Hepatic urea {{synthesis}} is the organism's {{main channel}} for {{the disposal of}} nitrogen {{and it may be}} an 'essential' liver function. In six control subjects and five patients with cirrhosis of the liver urea synthesis was studied during continuous infusion for six to 24 hours of about 3 mmol alpha-amino nitrogen/h X kg body weight. The urea synthesis rate was calculated in intervals of two hours as urinary excretion with correction for accumulation in the total body water and for hydrolysis of urea in the gut. The peripheral venous plasma <b>alpha-amino</b> <b>nitrogen</b> concentration increased from 3 to about 14 mmol/l and the urea nitrogen synthesis rate from 25 to about 215 mmol/h. In all cases the urea synthesis rate rose linearly with the alpha-amino concentration throughout the examined range. The slope of this linear relationship is an expression of the hepatic conversion of <b>alpha-amino</b> <b>nitrogen</b> to urea nitrogen ('functional hepatic nitrogen clearance'). The functional hepatic nitrogen clearance was 22. 4 l/h in control subjects and 13. 7 1 /h (P < 0. 025) in the patients with cirrhosis. It was correlated with quantitative measures of the liver function (the galactose elimination capacity, r = 0. 84, and the clearance of antipyrine, 4 = 0. 80).

40|$|The biosynthetic {{activities}} of the polypeptide subunits alpha and beta of glutamine synthetase (GS) were inhibited in vitro by glycine and serine. These amino acids inhibited {{the growth of a}} mutant strain with partial GS activity when grown on glutamate as the nitrogen source and also blocked the synthesis of the glutamine in vivo, thus demonstrating the inhibitory effect on GS activity in vivo. Glycine and serine lowered the intracellular glutamine pool and regulated GS beta synthesis. A preferential induction of synthesis of the GS beta polypeptide was observed when either of these amino acids was present in the medium. On this basis, we obtained a glycine-sensitive mutant which showed a structural alteration of the GS beta polypeptide.

40|$|The {{effect of}} Monensin (Rumensin, Eli Lilly & Co.) in incubations with mixed rumen {{microorganisms}} metabolizing carbohydrate or protein substrates was investigated. Monensin partly inhibited methanogenesis and increased propionate production, although {{the effect was}} not always statistically significant. Incubations with substrates specific for methane bacteria suggest that inhibition of methanogenesis by Monensin was not due to a specific toxic action on the methanogenic flora, but rather to an inhibition of hydrogen production from formate. Total and net microbial growth were considerably decreased by addition of Monensin, although the amount of substrate fermented was not altered, resulting in lowered values of microbial growth efficiency. In incubations with casein, Monensin lowered protein degradation in line with a lowered ammonia production, whereas a slight accumulation of <b>alpha-amino</b> <b>nitrogen</b> was observed. The results suggest that besides an influence of Monensin on the rumen carbohydrate fermentation pattern, {{another reason for the}} beneficial effects observed in vivo might be decreased food protein degradation in the rumen, altering the final site of protein digestion in the animal.

The larger muscle development in BBDM animals {{was associated with a}} trend to higher nitrogen retention, higher food conversion efficiency (p < 0. 05) and lower apparent digestibility (p < 0. 05). No difference was found between the groups for plasma glucose concentration. Higher creatinine, lower <b>alpha-amino</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> lower triglycerides and higher non-esterified fatty acid plasma levels were observed in BBDM as compared to Holstein bulls (p < 0. 05), the BBDP group being intermediate. A trend to a higher cholesterol plasma level was found in BBDM animals. There was no difference between the three groups in plasma fatty acid composition, except for the C 14 : 0 content. Some of the differences in plasma metabolites were related to carcass composition and endocrine regulation, a decrease in muscle development and an increase in adiposity being associated with lower growth hormone production (p < 0. 05) and higher insulin (p < 0. 05) and IGF secretions.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comRestricted growth before birth is associated with impaired insulin secretion but with initially enhanced insulin sensitivity in early postnatal life, which then progresses to insulin resistance and impaired glucose homeostasis by adulthood. This suggests that prenatal restraint impairs insulin secretion, but increases insulin sensitivity, before birth. Poor placental growth and function are major causes of restricted fetal growth in humans. We have therefore investigated the effects of restricted placental growth and function on plasma glucose, <b>alpha-amino</b> <b>nitrogen</b> and insulin concentrations and glucose- and arginine-stimulated insulin secretion in the fetal sheep at 120 and 140 days gestational age, and on insulin sensitivity, measured by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp, at 130 days gestational age. Placental restriction decreased fetal blood pH and oxygen content, and weight in late gestation by approximately 20 %. Reduced fetal and placental weights and indices of poor placental function, in particular fetal hypoxia and hypoglycaemia, were associated with impaired glucose- and arginine-stimulated insulin secretion, but not with changes in insulin sensitivity in the fetal sheep. We conclude that the impaired insulin secretion capacity reported in children and adults after intrauterine growth restriction, and in the neonatal and young adult sheep which is small at birth, is present in utero and persists. Whether this reflects {{the actions of the}} adverse intrauterine environment or changes to intrinsic capacity is unclear, but in utero interventions may be necessary to improve postnatal insulin secretion in the infant who is growth-restricted before birth...|$|E

The levels of the Maillard precursors (i. e., reducing sugars (RS) and free <b>alpha-amino</b> <b>nitrogen</b> (FAN)) depended on soaking temperature and time: leaching of RS was compensated by enzymic formation for long soaking times (> 60 min), while proteolytic activity was too low to compensate for FAN leaching. Rice soaking under nitrogen, oxygen, or ambient conditions and determination of polyphenol oxidase activity allowed us {{to conclude that the}} effect of enzymic color changes on the soaked rice color was rather small. Color measurements of brown and milled mildly, intermediately, and severely parboiled rice samples showed that both brown and milled rice samples were darker and more red and yellow after parboiling and that the effect depended on the severity of parboiling conditions. Furthermore, steaming affected the rice color more and in a way opposite to that observed in soaking. The changes in RS and the loss of FAN during parboiling suggested that Maillard type reactions occur during brown rice steaming. Analyses of furosine levels confirmed Maillard browning of outer bran layers and endosperm during steaming. The level of this Maillard indicator increased with the severity of parboiling conditions in both brown and milled parboiled rice.

Treatment with pGH increased maternal backfat loss between day 25 and day 51 of pregnancy, and increased maternal plasma IGF-I concentrations measured at day 51 of pregnancy. Fetal body weight, length and skull width at day 51 of pregnancy were increased by maternal treatment with pGH. Fetal plasma glucose concentrations were increased and maternal/fetal plasma glucose concentration gradients were decreased by maternal pGH treatment at 13. 4, but not 25. 6 microg/kg. day.

Overall, fetal weight was {{negatively correlated with}} fetal plasma concentrations of urea, positively correlated with maternal plasma <b>alpha-amino</b> <b>nitrogen</b> concentrations and unrelated to glucose concentrations in either maternal or fetal plasma.

Maternal undernutrition in humans can increase adiposity, and the risk of coronary heart disease and impaired glucose tolerance in adult life, which may be partly mediated by maternal or fetal endocrine stress responses. In sheep, dexamethasone in early pregnancy impairs cardiovascular function, but not glucose homeostasis in adult female offspring. However, male offspring are often more susceptible to early life "programming". Pregnant sheep were infused intravenously with saline (0. 19 ml/h), dexamethasone (0. 48 mg/h), or cortisol (5 mg/h), for 2 days from 26 to 28 days of gestation. In male offspring, size at birth and postnatal growth were measured, and glucose tolerance [intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) ], insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity of glucose, <b>alpha-amino</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> and free fatty acid metabolism were assessed at 4 yr of age. We show that cortisol, but not dexamethasone, treatment of mothers causes fasting hyperglycemia in adult male offspring. Maternal cortisol induced a second-phase hyperinsulinemia during IVGTT, whereas maternal dexamethasone induced a first-phase hyperinsulinemia. Dexamethasone improved glucose tolerance, while cortisol had no impact, and neither affected insulin sensitivity. This suggests that maternal glucocorticoid exposure in early pregnancy alters glucose homeostasis and induces hyperinsulinemia in adult male offspring, but in a glucocorficoidspecific manner. These consequences of glucocorticoid exposure in early pregnancy may lead to pancreatic exhaustion and diabetes longer term and are consistent with stress during early pregnancy contributing to such outcomes in humans...|$|E

Atropine, which decreases milk protein yield, has been theorised to act either by decreasing blood somatotropin (ST) concentration or by decreasing blood amino acid (AA) concentration. Thus, the first experiment was designed to test which mechanism, or both, {{is responsible for the}} effects on milk protein yield. Five lactating dairy cows were assigned to the following treatments which were administered intravenously: Saline (CONT), atropine (ATR), ATR + ST, ATR + AAs, and ATR + ST + AAs. Atropine treatment failed to decrease plasma ST concentration but did decrease plasma <b>alpha-amino</b> <b>nitrogen</b> concentration. Atropine treatment decreased milk protein yield but neither ST, AAs, nor ST + AAs were able to maintain milk protein yield at the CONT level when infused with ATR. It is clear that the treatments tested are not directly responsible for the decrease in milk protein yield due to ATR. Therefore, neither ST, AAs, nor ST + AAs appear to have direct control of milk protein production. Plasma insulin (INS) concentration was decreased and plasma IGF-I concentration was not decreased by ATR treatment. Insulin, therefore, presents itself as a candidate for direct control over milk protein synthesis. The second model is one of monitoring endocrine response to abomasal infusion of AAs mimicking the profile of milk protein with selective deletion of certain AAs. Six lactating dairy cows were subjected to the following treatments: Saline (negative control, NC), AAs (positive control, PC), PC minus methionine (PC-Met), PC minus lysine (PC-Lys), PC minus histidine (PC-His), and PC minus the branched-chain AAs (PC-BCAAs). All endocrine factors studied (ST, INS, glucagon & IGF-I) were affected by treatment. Plasma IGF-I concentration responded similarly, except for the PC-Met treatment, to milk protein yield (Weekes and Cant, 20...|$|E
