25|$|Later in the day, {{the crew}} {{finished}} their final preparations for Atlantis’s planned landing. Commander Ferguson and Pilot Hurley practiced landing procedures {{with a video}} game-like simulator, the Portable Inflight Landing Operations Trainer (PILOT). At 6:15 UTC, Ferguson, Hurley and Walheim powered {{up one of the}} APUs to conduct OPS-8 activities. This process verified the functionality of Atlantiss flight control surfaces, <b>actuating</b> <b>the</b> rudder, speed brakes, wing and tail body flaps which guided the shuttle through the atmosphere. They then stowed the Ku-Band antenna at 10:34 a.m. EDT and went to sleep.|$|E
500|$|In his report, {{the judge}} {{recommended}} {{modification of the}} lever <b>actuating</b> <b>the</b> automatic pilot. [...] The inquiry uncovered four irregularities in the regulation of civil aviation in Australia and the judge made four recommendations {{to deal with these}} irregularities.|$|E
500|$|It was {{discovered}} that the craft was inherently unstable in forward flight, as the aerodynamic center of pressure was well forward {{of the center of}} gravity. The Avrocar thus included a mechanical stability control system that was independent of the pilot's controls. The turborotor had a fairly large angular momentum and was intended to act as a powerful gyroscope, providing a [...] "normal" [...] direction of flight. Control cables attached {{to the base of the}} rotor would be pulled when the craft moved in relation to the rotor, <b>actuating</b> <b>the</b> control surfaces to counteract the motion.|$|E

500|$|In the machine's {{original}} 1868 design, {{paper was}} placed horizontally {{on the top}} of the machine, held in place by a movable square frame (to provide line and letter spacing). Above the paper and centered on the device, an arm held an inked ribbon which crossed over a small metal plate. Depressing a key caused a typebar to rise from underneath the paper, pressing the paper upwards against the ribbon and thus printing an inked character. This method of imprinting required use of very thin, nonstandard paper (such as tissue paper). Two variants were produced with alternative methods of <b>actuating</b> <b>the</b> typebars: one in which the keys and typebars were connected by a series of wires and one in which the keys directly [...] "kicked" [...] the typebars upwards.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, {{the next}} generation, the ETR 460, styled by Giorgetto Giugiaro, began service. Though plagued by {{technical}} teething problems, the ETR 460 introduced several innovations, such as more powerful AC asynchronous motors. Further, the pistons <b>actuating</b> <b>the</b> anti-tilting action {{were placed in}} the bogie instead of on the carbody sides: this permitted the reorganisation of the vestibules and passenger compartment areas, improving comfort. The bogie-to-body connection is extremely simple and easy to make, with clear advantages for maintenance[...]|$|E

The unit itself weighs approximately 11.7 pounds without a TV. It connects to a television via a combined A/V and RF Switch cable. By <b>actuating</b> <b>the</b> green button, a user can toggle between an A/V Cable or RF Switch connection.

2500|$|If {{a player}} {{does not have}} A, K, or Q, it is to that player's {{advantage}} to lead spades to try to force Q onto another player. This is {{also referred to as}} [...] "smoking the Lady/Queen", in reference to the combat action of creating smoke in a closed area so that any enemy combatants hiding there would be forced to come out into the open (i.e., the Queen is forced to be played by her bearer, thus causing the Queen's points to be taken by that bearer, and thus evaded by the player <b>actuating</b> <b>the</b> smoking.) A player who has A or K but not Q, and with a large number of other spades, may feel that he is insulated from being forced to play A or K in any subsequent smoking play, and thus could also participate in smoking. [...] Even the player that the Q, provided he similarly has a lot of other spades may decide to [...] "smoke himself" [...] to empty all the other players of their spades, thus ironically insulating himself from being smoked in the future – or perhaps to get the game into the situation in which another player(s) has a [...] "dry" [...] (i.e., solitary) spade that is A or K, in which case he could start a trick with Q in full knowledge that some other player has this dry A or K and will be forced to play it, taking the Q's points.|$|E

60|$|The {{effect of}} a thing is never quite what we have forecast. Mrs. Hilary heard Matt's {{confession}} without apparently anything of his tumult in making it. Women, after all, dwell mainly {{in the region of}} the affections; even the most worldly women have their likes and dislikes, and the question of the sort Matt had sprung upon his mother, is first a personal question with them. She was not a very worldly woman; but she liked her place in the world, and she preferred conformity and similarity; the people she was born of and bred with, were the nicest kind of people, and she did not see how any one could differ from them to advantage. Their ideas were the best, or they would not have had them; she, herself, did not wish to have other ideas. But her family was more, far more, to her than her world was. She knew that in his time her husband had not had the ideas of her world concerning slavery, but she had always contrived to honor the ideas of both. Since her son had begun to disagree with her world concerning what he called the industrial slavery, she contrived, without the sense of inconsistency, to suffer him and yet remain with the world. She represented in her maternal tolerance, the principle <b>actuating</b> <b>the</b> church, which includes the facts as fast as they accomplish themselves, without changing any point of doctrine.|$|E
6000|$|We assuredly {{believe that}} the Bible {{contains}} all truths necessary to salvation, and that therein is preserved the undoubted Word of God. We assert likewise that, besides these express oracles and immediate revelations, there are Scriptures which to the soul and conscience of every Christian man bear irresistible evidence of the Divine Spirit assisting and <b>actuating</b> <b>the</b> authors; and that both these and the former are such as to render it morally impossible that any passage of the small inconsiderable portion, not included in one or other of these, can supply either ground or occasion of any error in faith, practice, or affection, except to those who wickedly and wilfully seek a pretext for their unbelief. And if in that {{small portion of the}} Bible which stands in no necessary connection with the known and especial ends and purposes of the Scriptures, there should be a few apparent errors resulting from the state of knowledge then existing-- errors which the best and holiest men might entertain uninjured, and which without a miracle those men must have entertained; if I find no such miraculous prevention asserted, and see no reason for supposing it--may I not, to ease the scruples of a perplexed inquirer, venture to say to him; [...] "Be it so. What then? The absolute infallibility even of the inspired writers in matters altogether incidental and foreign to the objects and purposes of their inspiration is no part of my creed: and even if a professed divine should follow the doctrine of the Jewish Church so far as not to attribute to the Hagiographa, in every word and sentence, the same height and fulness of inspiration as to the Law and the Prophets, I feel no warrant to brand him as a heretic for an opinion, the admission of which disarms the infidel without endangering a single article of the Catholic Faith."--If to an unlearned but earnest and thoughtful neighbour I give the advice;--"Use the Old Testament to express the affections excited, and to confirm the faith and morals taught you, in the New, and leave all the rest to the students and professors of theology and Church history! You profess only to be a Christian:"--am I misleading my brother in Christ? ...|$|E
60|$|As {{he stepped}} into the neutral space between the friends and enemies of Dylks, he had a sort of double fearfulness for the women, because he was not only not of their faith, but because he was of no {{religious}} sect in a community where every one but an open infidel like Matthew Braile was of some profession. He came to the Baptist services with his mother, but he had not been baptized, and he was not seen at the house to house prayer meetings, where the young people came with the old, or at the frolics where dancing was forbidden, but not kissing in their games or in their walks home through the woods. He was not supposed to be in love with any one, and he lived alone on a rich bottom-land farm with his mother, in a house which his father had built where his grandfather's log cabin had stood. He was of a tradition which held him closer to the wilderness than most of the people of Leatherwood; in the two generations before him the Redfields had won and held their lands against the Indians, and had fought them in the duels, from tree to tree, which the pioneers taught the savages, or learned from them, risking their lives and scalps in the same chances. He was of the sort of standing which old family gives, even where all families are new, and he was now making his way politically, in spite of his irreligion; he meant to go to the legislature, eventually, and in a leisurely sort he was reading law, and reciting his Blackstone to Matthew Braile. As he came and went from the old infidel's house, he was apt to stop at the tavern porch, where the few citizens who could detach their minds from the things of another world gave them in cloudy conjecture to the political affairs of this, or to scrutiny of the real motives <b>actuating</b> <b>the</b> occasional travelers who apparently arrived for a meal's victuals or a night's lodging. With these Redfield had scarcely a social life, but he could talk with them {{almost to the point of}} haranguing them, for they were men; at the store, where his mother's errands sometimes took him, he shrank from the women as timid as they when they dismounted from their saddles or wagons, and slipped in with their butter and eggs, and passed out again deeply obscured in their sunbonnets.|$|E
