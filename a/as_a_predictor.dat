5|$|As {{with many}} Korean rural folk traditions, {{the sport is}} {{regarded}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>predictor</b> of future events, specifically harvests. The outcome of a ritualised contest {{between the two sides}} of a village (East and West) was seen as an indicator of the abundance (or otherwise) of that year's rice crop, which would be harvested in the autumn; as a result, juldarigi and similar folk sports are predominant in the rice-growing areas of the South. This is due to the common association in Southeast Asia between dragons (which the ropes of the juldarigi are thought to resemble) and rain; as a result juldarigi or similar tug-of-war ceremonies have also historically been staged during periods of drought. The connection of the two ropes used (with one rope's smaller loop being placed through the other's larger loop) is reminiscent of sexual intercourse, which also gives rise to the sport's association with fecundity.|$|E

The direct effect of entrepreneurial strategy on strategic performance is 0.608 while the effect on market-based performance is 0.375. The findings show that entrepreneurial strategy acts <b>as</b> <b>a</b> strong <b>predictor</b> of entrepreneurial implementation.

25|$|Similarly, {{interactions}} between extraversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness have demonstrated significant impacts on subjective-well being. In one study, researchers used three scale to assess subjective well-being.

This difference favored males. In the three high ability samples, males scored higher than females in mental rotation ability. Interestingly enough, for the verbal aptitude test on SAT, {{there was a significant difference}} in verbal ability for the low ability college bound sample favoring girls.|$|E

It was this multistage test, a description of which was first published in 1963, that became known as the Bruce Protocol. In the initial paper, Bruce reported that the test could detect signs of such conditions as angina pectoris, a previous heart attack, or a ventricular aneurysm. Bruce his and colleagues also demonstrated that exercise testing was useful in screening apparently healthy people for early signs of coronary artery disease.|$|E
25|$|Until 2004, primary {{students}} traditionally {{took the}} National Elementary Achievement Test (NEAT) {{administered by the}} Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS). It {{was intended as a}} measure of a school's competence, and not <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>predictor</b> of student aptitude or success in secondary school. Hence, the scores obtained by students in the NEAT were not used as a basis for their admission into secondary school. During 2004, when DECS was officially converted into the Department of Education, the NEAT was changed to the National Achievement Test (NAT) by the Department of Education. Both the public and private elementary schools take this exam to measure a school's competency. As of 2006, only private schools have entrance examinations for secondary schools.|$|E
25|$|People with a {{homosexual}} orientation can express their sexuality {{in a variety}} of ways, and may or may not express it in their behaviors. Many have sexual relationships predominately with people of their own gender identity, though some have sexual relationships with those of the opposite gender, bisexual relationships, or none at all (celibacy). Survey data indicates that between 40% and 60% of gay men and between 45% and 80% of lesbians are currently involved in a romantic relationship. Survey data also indicate that between 18% and 28% of gay couples and between 8% and 21% of lesbian couples in the U.S. have lived together ten or more years. Studies have found same-sex and opposite-sex couples to be equivalent to each other in measures of satisfaction and commitment in relationships, that age and gender are more reliable than sexual orientation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>predictor</b> of satisfaction and commitment to a relationship, and that people who are heterosexual or homosexual share comparable expectations and ideals with regard to romantic relationships.|$|E

25|$|Sugarbeet root aphid stem mothers induce gall {{formation}} in the leaf by probing the leaf tissue with their stylets. This leads {{to the formation of}} a small depression on the leaf, which eventually closes up over the stem mother and forms a gall. The extent of the probing activity dictates gall size, and removing the stem mother early on in the process leads to the formation of an unclosed, rudimentary gall. The extent of probing activity is correlated with the aphid's reproductive success. The probing activity may also serve a secondary purpose in helping the aphid determine leaf size. Leaf size {{is an important factor in}} determining what leaf a stem mother chooses to develop a gall on, but at the time of leaf colonization, leaves that are being colonized are only a tenth to a quarter of their mature size. It has been suggested that, during the probing of the leaf, the stem mother gauges the chemical environment of the leaf and uses that <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>predictor</b> of final leaf size and suitability as a gall site. Aphids possess chemosensory organs, allowing them to respond to a variety of stimuli from the plant, both those of the volatile variety (olfaction) and non-volatile variety (taste). Once the aphid is on a plant, it tests the surface of plant with its antennae and probes the plant with its mouth parts. The antennae contain many sensilla, allowing them to sense tactile and chemical stimuli.|$|E

In this research, the farmer characteristics consist of personal and psychological characteristic, whereas the competencies consist of technical and entrepreneurial competency. This research used 121 data of beef cattle farmers that collected by proportional cluster sampling according to the central areas of the farm, namely Cikancung, Cimenyan, and Cimaung Districts. The data were analyzed by SEM (Structural Equation Modeling) analysis. The results showed that both characteristics positively and significantly influence both competencies, and also have an indirect effect on business performance by technical competency. Psychological characteristic (need for achievement <b>as</b> <b>a</b> strong <b>predictor)</b> more influential on competencies than personal characteristic (informal education <b>as</b> <b>a</b> strong <b>predictor).</b> Technical competency (managing marketing and input <b>as</b> <b>a</b> strong <b>predictor)</b> positively (γ= 0. 81) and significantly influence the business performance (productivity <b>as</b> <b>a</b> strong <b>predictor),</b> while the influence of entrepreneurial competency is not significant. Indirectly, psychological characteristic (0. 56) more influential on business performance than personal characteristic (0. 29). The implication, beef cattle productivity can be increased by improving technical competency, especially for managing marketing and input.
