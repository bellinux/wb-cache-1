5|$|Cognition {{can also}} be {{affected}} in Wilson's disease. This comes in two, not mutually exclusive, categories: frontal lobe disorder (may present as impulsivity, impaired judgement, promiscuity, apathy and executive dysfunction with poor planning and decision making) and subcortical dementia (may present as slow thinking, memory loss and executive dysfunction, without signs of aphasia, <b>apraxia</b> or agnosia). It is suggested that these cognitive involvements are related and closely linked to psychiatric manifestations of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Developmental verbal dyspraxia, {{also known}} as Childhood <b>apraxia</b> of speech, is a {{developmental}} motor speech disorder involving impairments in the motor control of speech production. The speech {{of a child with}} developmental verbal dyspraxia may be unintelligible to the point that daily communication needs cannot be met. A child with developmental verbal dyspraxia often experiences great amounts of frustration, so AAC can be a strategy to support communication alongside more traditional speech therapy to improve speech production.|$|E
5|$|In {{people with}} AD, the {{increasing}} impairment {{of learning and}} memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, perception (agnosia), or execution of movements (<b>apraxia)</b> are more prominent than memory problems. AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life (episodic memory), facts learned (semantic memory), and implicit memory (the memory of the body {{on how to do}} things, such as using a fork to eat or how to drink from a glass) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories.|$|E
25|$|However, {{many people}} with <b>apraxia</b> are {{no longer able to}} be independent. Those with limb-kinetic and/or gait <b>apraxia</b> should avoid {{activities}} in which they might injure themselves or others.|$|E
25|$|The {{prognosis}} {{for individuals with}} <b>apraxia</b> varies. With therapy, some patients improve significantly, while others may show very little improvement. Some individuals with <b>apraxia</b> may benefit {{from the use of}} a communication aid.|$|E
25|$|Ideational <b>apraxia</b> {{has been}} {{observed}} in patients with lesions in the dominant hemisphere near areas associated with aphasia; however, {{more research is needed}} on ideational <b>apraxia</b> due to brain lesions. The localization of lesions in areas of the frontal and temporal lobes would provide explanation for the difficulty in motor planning seen in ideational <b>apraxia</b> as well as its difficulty to distinguish it from certain aphasias.|$|E
25|$|Cogan oculomotor <b>apraxia.</b>|$|E
25|$|As stated above, <b>apraxia</b> {{should not}} be {{confused}} with aphasia; however, they frequently occur together. It has been stated that <b>apraxia</b> is so often accompanied by aphasia that many believe that if a person displays AOS; it should be assumed that the patient also has some level of aphasia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Apraxia</b> {{of speech}} (AOS) is an {{acquired}} oral motor speech disorder affecting an individual's ability to translate conscious speech plans into motor plans, {{which results in}} limited and difficult speech ability. By the definition of <b>apraxia,</b> AOS affects volitional (willful or purposeful) movement patterns, however AOS usually also affects automatic speech.|$|E
25|$|No drug {{has been}} shown useful for {{treating}} <b>apraxia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Developmental verbal {{dyspraxia}} (DVD), {{also known}} as childhood <b>apraxia</b> of speech (CAS) and developmental <b>apraxia</b> of speech (DAS); is an inability to utilize motor planning to perform movements necessary for speech during a child's language learning process. Although the causes differ between AOS and DVD, the main characteristics and treatments are similar.|$|E
25|$|Treatment for {{individuals}} with <b>apraxia</b> includes speech therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy.|$|E
25|$|The Test to Measure Upper Limb <b>Apraxia</b> (TULIA) is {{one method}} of {{determining}} upper limb <b>apraxia</b> through the {{qualitative and quantitative}} assessment of gesture production. In contrast to previous publications on apraxic assessment, {{the reliability and validity}} of TULIA was thoroughly investigated. The TULIA consists of subtests for the imitation and pantomime of non-symbolic (“put your index finger on top of your nose”), intransitive (“wave goodbye”) and transitive (“show me how to use a hammer”) gestures. Discrimination (differentiating between well- and poorly performed tasks) and recognition (indicating which object corresponds to a pantomimed gesture) tasks are also often tested for a full <b>apraxia</b> evaluation.|$|E
25|$|Related {{conditions}} can include <b>apraxia,</b> dysarthria or other communication disorders, sensory impairments, urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, or behavioural disorders.|$|E
25|$|Research {{about the}} {{treatment}} of <b>apraxia</b> has revealed four main categories: articulatory-kinematic, rate/rhythm control, intersystemic facilitation/reorganization treatments, and alternative/augmentative communication.|$|E
25|$|<b>Apraxia</b> is {{most often}} due to a lesion located in the {{dominant}} (usually left) hemisphere of the brain, typically in the frontal and parietal lobes. Lesions {{may be due to}} stroke, acquired brain injuries, or neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or other dementias, Parkinson's disease, or Huntington's disease. It is also possible for <b>apraxia</b> to be caused by lesions {{in other areas of the}} brain including the non-dominant (usually right) hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|<b>Apraxia</b> {{of speech}} can also occur in {{conjunction}} with dysarthria (muscle weakness affecting speech production) or aphasia (language difficulties related to neurological damage).|$|E
25|$|<b>Apraxia</b> is a {{neurological}} {{condition in which}} an individual loses the ability to execute movements that the individual is otherwise physically capable of performing.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{pediatric}} {{speech and}} language disorders include receptive and expressive language disorders, speech sound disorders, childhood <b>apraxia</b> of speech, stuttering, and language-based learning disabilities.|$|E
25|$|Julie Wambaugh’s {{research}} {{focuses on}} clinically applicable treatments for acquired <b>apraxia</b> of speech. She recently published an article examining the effects of repeated practice and rate/rhythm control on sound production accuracy. Wambaugh and colleagues studied the effects of such treatment for 10 individuals with acquired <b>apraxia</b> of speech. The results indicate that repeated practice treatment results in significant improvements in articulation for most clients. In addition, rate/rhythm control helped some clients, but not others. Thus, incorporating repeated practice treatment into therapy would likely help individuals with AOS.|$|E
25|$|Ataxia oculomotor <b>apraxia</b> type 2 (AOA2) is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder also similar to A-T in manifesting increasing problems with coordination and peripheral neuropathy, but oculomotor <b>apraxia</b> {{is present in}} only half of affected individuals. Ocular telangiectasia do not develop. Laboratory abnormalities of AOA2 are like A-T, and unlike AOA1, in having an elevated serum AFP level, but like AOA1 and unlike A-T in having normal markers of immune function. Genetic testing of the senataxin gene (SETX) can confirm the diagnosis. There is no enhanced risk for cancer.|$|E
25|$|Studies of gestural ability {{incorporating}} BPO measures consider {{aspects of}} cognition, language, language impairment, and motor <b>apraxia.</b> Cognitive and linguistic studies tend to emphasize symbolic representation, expression, and comprehension {{in a human}} development context. Language impairment studies utilize BPO measures to explore gestural deficits that are correlated with particular language capabilities, and to help distinguish distinctive categories of - and degrees of severity in - aphasia. Studies of motor <b>apraxia</b> use BPO measures to better understand gestural impairment in apraxic patients, and often consider aphasia as an apraxic phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Cogan occulomotor <b>apraxia</b> {{is a rare}} {{disorder}} of development. Affected children have difficulty moving their eyes only to a new visual target, so they will turn their head past the target to “drag” the eyes to the new object of interest, then turn the head back. This tendency becomes evident in late infancy and toddler years, and mostly improves with time. This contrasts to the oculomotor difficulties evident in children with A-T, which are not evident in early childhood but emerge over time. Cogan’s oculomotor <b>apraxia</b> is generally an isolated problem, or {{may be associated with}} broader developmental delay.|$|E
25|$|Constructional <b>apraxia</b> {{is often}} caused by lesions of the {{inferior}} non-dominant parietal lobe, {{and can be}} caused by brain injury, illness, tumor or other condition that can result in a brain lesion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Apraxia</b> {{of speech}} (AOS): Difficulty {{planning}} and coordinating the movements necessary for speech (e.g. Potato=Totapo, Topato.) AOS can independently occur without issues {{in areas such}} as verbal comprehension, reading comprehension, writing, articulation or prosody.|$|E
25|$|Ideomotor <b>apraxia</b> is {{typically}} {{due to a}} decrease in {{blood flow to the}} dominant hemisphere of the brain and particularly the parietal and premotor areas. It is frequently seen in patients with corticobasal degeneration.|$|E
25|$|Rate {{and rhythm}} control {{treatments}} exist to improve errors in patients’ timing of speech, a common characteristic of <b>Apraxia.</b> These techniques often include an external source of control like metronomic pacing, for example, in repeated speech productions.|$|E
25|$|Although {{qualitative}} and quantitative studies exist, there is little consensus on the proper method to assess for <b>apraxia.</b> The criticisms of past methods include failure to meet standard psychometric properties as well as research-specific designs that translate poorly to non-research use.|$|E
25|$|BPO, and BPO {{measures}} particularly, are notable in {{that they}} have proven useful in studying cognition (e.g. language development, developmental psychology), and in identifying - and to a limited degree, in treating - cognitive impairment (e.g. aphasia, <b>apraxia,</b> schizophrenia etc.).|$|E
25|$|<b>Apraxia</b> {{of speech}} can be {{diagnosed}} by a speech language pathologist (SLP) through specific exams that measure oral mechanisms of speech. The oral mechanisms exam involves {{tasks such as}} pursing lips, blowing, licking lips, elevating the tongue, and also involves {{an examination of the}} mouth. A complete exam also involves observation of the patient eating and talking. SLPs do not agree on a specific set of characteristics that make up the <b>apraxia</b> of speech diagnosis, so any of the characteristics from the section above could be used to form a diagnosis. Patients may be asked to perform other daily tasks such as reading, writing, and conversing with others. In situations involving brain damage, an MRI brain scan also helps identify damaged areas of the brain.|$|E
25|$|There {{are five}} typical autosomal-recessive {{disorders}} in which ataxia is a prominent feature: Friedreich ataxia, ataxia-telangiectasia, ataxia with vitamin E deficiency, ataxia with oculomotor <b>apraxia</b> (AOA), spastic ataxia. Disorder subdivisions: Friedreich's ataxia, Spinocerebellar ataxia, Ataxia telangiectasia, Vasomotor ataxia, Vestibulocerebellar, Ataxiadynamia, Ataxiophemia, Olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.|$|E
25|$|Ataxia oculomotor <b>apraxia</b> type 1 (AOA1) is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder similar to A-T in manifesting increasing problems with coordination and oculomotor <b>apraxia,</b> often {{at a similar}} age to those having A-T. It is caused by mutation in the gene coding for the protein aprataxin. Affected individuals differ from those with A-T by the early appearance of peripheral neuropathy, early in their course manifest difficulty with initiation of gaze shifts, {{and the absence of}} ocular telangiectasia, but laboratory features are of key importance in the differentiation of the two. Individuals with AOA1 have a normal AFP, normal measures of immune function, and after 10–15 years have low serum levels of albumin. Genetic testing of the aprataxin gene can confirm the diagnosis. There is no enhanced risk for cancer.|$|E
25|$|Buccofacial or {{orofacial}} apraxia: Non-verbal oral or buccofacial ideomotor <b>apraxia</b> {{resulting in}} difficulty carrying out {{movements of the}} face on demand. For example, an inability to lick one's lips or whistle. This is an ability to carry out any volitional movements of the tongue, cheeks, lips, pharynx, or larynx on command.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there may}} not be a strong {{correlation}} between formal test results and actual performance in everyday functioning or activities of daily living (ADLs). A comprehensive assessment of <b>apraxia</b> should include formal testing, standardized measurements of ADLs, observation of daily routines, self-report questionnaires and targeted interviews with the patients and their relatives.|$|E
25|$|New {{research}} has found that dysfunction in the area may lead to other speech disorders such as stuttering and <b>apraxia</b> of speech. Recent anatomical neuroimaging {{studies have shown that the}} pars opercularis of Broca's area is anatomically smaller in individuals who stutter whereas the pars triangularis appears to be normal.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{physical}} disabilities that can result from stroke include muscle weakness, numbness, pressure sores, pneumonia, incontinence, <b>apraxia</b> (inability to perform learned movements), difficulties carrying out daily activities, appetite loss, speech loss, vision loss and pain. If the stroke is severe enough, or in a certain location such as parts of the brainstem, coma or death can result.|$|E
