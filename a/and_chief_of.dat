5|$|Between 1945 and 1950 the US {{fleet of}} battleships had been entirely decommissioned; however, Missouri was spared this fate {{due to the}} {{influence}} of President Harry S.

Sullivan, <b>and</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>of</b> Naval Operations Louis E. Denfeld, Truman ordered Missouri to be maintained with the active fleet partly because of his fondness for the battleship and partly because the battleship had been christened by his daughter. As a result, Missouri was involved in various training and flag waving exercises at home and abroad between World War II and the Korean War.|$|E
