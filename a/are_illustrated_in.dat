5|$|Calhoun's {{ideas on}} the {{concurrent}} majority <b>are</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> A Disquisition on Government. The Disquisition is a 100-page essay on Calhoun's definitive and comprehensive ideas on government, which he worked on intermittently for six years until its 1849 completion. It systematically presents his arguments that a numerical majority in any government will typically impose a despotism over a minority unless some way is devised to secure the assent of all classes, sections, and interests and, similarly, that innate human depravity would debase government in a democracy.|$|E
5|$|Jain texts state that, after Mahavira was born, the god Indra {{came from}} the heavens, anointed him, and {{performed}} his abhisheka (consecration) on Mount Meru. These events <b>are</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> the artwork of numerous Jain temples and {{play a part in}} modern Jain temple rituals. The Kalpa sutras describing Mahavira's birth legends are recited by the Svetambara Jains during annual festivals such as Paryushana, but the same festival is observed by the Digambaras without the recitation.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} {{subspecies}} of long-toed salamander. The subspecies are discerned by their geographic location and patterns in their dorsal stripe; Denzel Ferguson gives a biogeographic account of skin patterns, morphology; {{based on this}} analysis, he introduced two new subspecies: A. macrodactylum columbianum and A. m. sigillatum. The ranges of subspecies <b>are</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> Robert Stebbin's amphibian field guides.|$|E

Elements of a progressive scheme include merit badges, which <b>are</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> their handbook and are obtained on a progressive basis. At present, NOSU {{is a small}} organization and has only one professional staff regularly employed in application of existing legislation. Being a new organization, NOSU still has to develop an efficient working organization.|$|E
25|$|The {{morphological}} {{structure of}} the human breast is identical in males and females until puberty. For pubescent girls in thelarche (the breast-development stage), the female sex hormones (principally estrogens) in conjunction with growth hormone promote the sprouting, growth, {{and development of the}} breasts. During this time, the mammary glands grow in size and volume and begin resting on the chest. These development stages of secondary sex characteristics (breasts, pubic hair, etc.) <b>are</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> the five-stage Tanner Scale.|$|E

25|$|Co-written by Reiss and Neil Feineman, {{a former}} editor for RayGun Magazine, Thirty Frames Per Second chronicles the history of music videos and its {{influence}} on pop culture, sports, advertising and fashion. The book features music video work by influential directors including: Spike Jonze, Peter Care, Kevin Kerslake, Mark Romanek, and David Fincher, and was positively reviewed by LA Weekly. Nearly 400 still shots from music videos <b>are</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> the book, {{which is the first}} of its kind to convert low resolution frame stills into high resolution digital imagery fit for print.|$|E
25|$|On {{the western}} {{entrance}} a triumphal arch stood, {{while on the}} eastern side there are the remains of an apse, whose function is unclear, but possibly served as a religious shrine. The apse features an East-oriented half-dome, and is 11m high and 9m wide. The remains of the arch, now vanished, <b>are</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> the sketches made in 1838 by Léon de Laborde: they depict an arched doorway, made of stone masonry, lying immediately at the entrance of the bridge. The next sketch provides some measured dimensions: the doorway was 10.37m high and 6.19m wide, while the pillars to either side were 4.35m thick.|$|E
25|$|Measuring {{the spin}} of these {{entangled}} particles along anti-parallel directions—i.e., {{along the same}} axis but in opposite directions, the set of all results is perfectly correlated. On the other hand, if measurements are performed along parallel directions they always yield opposite results, and the set of measurements shows perfect anti-correlation. This is {{in accord with the}} above stated probabilities of measuring the same result in these two cases. Finally, measurement at perpendicular directions has a 50% chance of matching, and the total set of measurements is uncorrelated. These basic cases <b>are</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> the table below. Columns should be read as examples of pairs of values that could be recorded by Alice and Bob with time increasing going to the right.|$|E

25|$|The careful {{methods of}} PAVN forces <b>are</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> the {{successful}} {{attack against the}} US Air Force's TACAN radar navigation facility in Laos (Lima Site 85), in March 1968. Situated on a mountain peak that was considered too tough to assault, the facilities were manned by a small force of USAF technicians on top, and about 1,000 Hmong and Thai irregulars deployed further down the slopes. NVA commandos however successfully climbed the mountain, killing or dispersing most of the guards and US airmen at the peak, while a larger follow-on echelon of NVA and Pathet Lao assaulted {{the rest of the}} mountain slopes below. The outgunned and outnumbered Hmong and Thai irregulars were defeated, and Communist forces held the site despite several days under counterattack by US aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Initially, More O’Ferrall {{introduced}} {{this type of}} analysis to discuss the continuity between concerted and step-wise β-elimination reaction mechanisms. The model also provided a framework within which to explain the effects of substituents and reaction conditions on the mechanism. The appropriate lower energy species were placed {{at the corners of}} the two dimensional plot (Figure 2). These were the reactants (top left), the products (bottom right) and the intermediates of the two possible stepwise reactions: the carbocation for E1 (bottom left) and the carbanion for E1cB (top-right). Thus, the horizontal axes represent the extent of deprotonation (C-H bond distance) and the vertical axes represent the extent of leaving group departure (C-LG distance). By applying the Hammond and anti-Hammond effects, he predicted the effects of various changes in the reactants or reaction conditions. For example, the effects of introducing a better leaving group on a substrate that initially eliminates via an E2 mechanism <b>are</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> Figure 2. A better leaving group increases the energy of the reactants and of the carbanion intermediate. Thus, the transition state moves towards the reactants and away from the carbanion intermediate.|$|E

500|$|The path to {{the afterlife}} as {{laid out in the}} Book of the Dead was a {{difficult}} one. The deceased was required to pass a series of gates, caverns and mounds guarded by supernatural creatures. These terrifying entities were armed with enormous knives and <b>are</b> <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> grotesque forms, typically as human figures with the heads of animals or combinations of different ferocious beasts. Their names—for instance, [...] "He who lives on snakes" [...] or [...] "He who dances in blood"—are equally grotesque. These creatures had to be pacified by reciting the appropriate spells included in the Book of the Dead; once pacified they posed no further threat, and could even extend their protection to the dead person. Another breed of supernatural creatures was 'slaughterers' who killed the unrighteous on behalf of Osiris; the Book of the Dead equipped its owner to escape their attentions. [...] As well as these supernatural entities, there were also threats from natural or supernatural animals, including crocodiles, snakes, and beetles.|$|E
