Narrow band whistler emissions correspond to the small Î± existing before dipolarization whereas the broad band emissions correspond to large Î± observed during and after dipolarization. The energy in the whistler mode is leaving the current sheet and is propagating along the background magnetic field, towards the Earth. A simple time-independent description based on the Liouville's theorem indicates that the electron temperature anisotropy decreases with the distance along the magnetic field from the equator. Once this variation of Î± is taken into account, the linear theory predicts an equatorial origin for the whistler mode.

The proton distributions and the wave dispersions are related through the condition that no further ion-cyclotron resonant particle scattering or wave growth/damping may take place. The thermal anisotropy of the protons in these states therefore defines the threshold value for triggering the proton-cyclotron <b>anisotropy</b> <b>instability.</b> A number of recent papers have noted that the anisotropy of solar wind protons at 1 AU {{does not seem to}} be limited by the proton-cyclotron anisotropy threshold, even at low plasma beta. However, this puzzle seems to be due solely to the estimation of this anisotropy threshold under the assumption that the protons have a bi-Maxwellian distribution. We note that bi-Maxwellian distributions are never marginally stable to the resonant cyclotron interaction, so these estimates do not represent physically valid thresholds. The threshold anisotropies obtained from our marginally stable states are much larger, as a function of proton parallel beta, than the bi-Maxwellian estimates, and we show that the measured data remains below these more rigorous thresholds. Thus, the results of this paper resolve the apparent contradiction presented by the solar wind anisotropy observations at 1 AU: The bi-Maxwellian anisotropies are not rigorous thresholds, and so do not limit the proton distributions in the solar wind.

40|$|In the heliosheath {{there are}} sectors of {{magnetic}} fields separated by current sheets thinner than the ion inertial length and thus {{subject to the}} tearing instability. This instability allows the development of magnetic islands that grow due to magnetic reconnection. Using PIC (particle-in-cell) simulations, we show that these islands are relevant because they quickly grow to fill up {{the space between the}} sectors and in the meanwhile generate temperature anisotropies, accelerate particles, and form instabilities based on the anisotropies. The plasma Î² (the ratio of the plasma pressure to the magnetic pressure) of a system can have a large effect on its dynamics since high Î² enhances the effects of pressure anisotropies. In our PIC simulations, we investigate a system of stacked current sheets that break up into magnetic islands due to magnetic reconnection, which is analogous to the compressed heliospheric current sheet in the heliosheath. We find that for high Î², and for realistic ion-to-electron mass ratios, only highly elongated islands reach finite size. The anisotropy within these islands prevents full contraction, leading to a final state of highly elongated islands in which further reconnection is suppressed. In the heliosheath there is evidence that these elongated islands are present. We performing a scaling of the growth of magnetic islands versus the system size. We thus determine that the islands, although reaching a final elongated state, can continue growing via the merging process until they reach the sector width. The islands achieve this size in much less time than it takes for the islands to convect through the heliosheath. We also find that the electron heating in our simulations has a strong Î² dependence. Particles are dominantly heated through Fermi reflection in contracting islands during island growth and merging. However, electron anisotropies support the development of a Weibel instability which impedes the Fermi acceleration of the electrons. In the heliosheath, we predict that energization of particles in general is limited by interaction with <b>anisotropy</b> <b>instabilities</b> such as the firehose instability, and by the the Weibel instability for electrons in particular...|$|R
