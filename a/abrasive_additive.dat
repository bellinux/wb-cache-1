40|$|High {{pressure}} waterjet cutting, with {{or without}} <b>abrasive</b> <b>additive,</b> is an unconventional machining process {{that is being used}} in nearly every manufacturing sector today, from aerospace to the food and textile industry. The process involves the conversion of water pressure energy into kinetic energy to allow cutting almost every kind of material. For such a task, an Ultra High Pressure (UHP) pump is used to achieve nominal pressures in the range between 20 and 50 MPa, or even higher. Machine tool components, due to those challenging pressure conditions, are strongly affected by faults and performances deterioration, with consequent impacts on quality and productivity. In-process analysis of sensor signals may support the end-user in assessing the health state of the system and detecting possible malfunctions. This study investigates the usage of the water pressure signal as a potential source of information for both health condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. Due {{to the nature of the}} signal, a functional data analysis approach is proposed, aimed at assessing the stability over time of the functional pattern that characterizes the in-control behavior of the system, in a Multivariate Statistical Process Control framework. A Fourier basis is selected to convert sampled signals into functional form, and time-warping functions are applied to cope with curve misalignment. Fourier parameters and warping function coefficients are merged into a multivariate vector that is monitored over time for early detection of possible malfunctions. Functional data classification is then used to identify the root cause of the observed pattern deviation in case of an actual fault affecting one of the machine tool components. Real data acquired under both in-control working conditions and in the presence of actual faulty UHP components are analyzed. Finally a comparison of the proposed classification technique with other methods already presented in the literature is provided and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The {{topic of}} water jet {{orifices}} efficiency and effectiveness evaluation {{has been considered}} in this paper. The performed analysis {{is based on the}} evaluation of the discharge, velocity and contraction coefficients for different water orifices. In order to overcome the difficulty to measure the water velocity at the orifice exit, which can reach 900 m/s in case of pure water jet applications (without <b>abrasive</b> <b>additives),</b> a suitable laser Doppler measurement system has been applied. An analysis of orifice performances is presented in the present paper, also considering the case of broken orifices, very important for industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of high performance material such as composites and advanced ceramics has {{a variety of}} manufacturing challenges. It is known that many of these materials cannot be effectively machined by conventional machining methods. Apart from economics, the process selection is based on the machined surface integrity. The high pressure waterjet with <b>abrasive</b> <b>additives</b> known as <b>abrasive</b> water jet (AWJ) is one viable alternative to conventional processing and has been suggested for use in post mold shaping of composites and other hard to cut material. The research works on water jet cutting is discussed in this paper. Omni directional cutting potential as well as minimal thermal and mechanical loading are few advantages. There are several parameters influencing the performance of abrasive water jet machining. Important process parameters which mainly affect the quality of cutting are traverse speed, hydraulic pressure, abrasive flow rate, standoff distance, and abrasive type, work material. Material removal rate (MRR) and surface roughness (Ra), taper of cut, width of cut are important quality parameters of AWJM. KEYWORDS...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With the {{development}} of IC manufacturing technology, the machining precision and surface quality of silicon wafer are proposed much higher, but now the planarization techniques of silicon wafer using free abrasive and bonded abrasive have the disadvantage of poor profile accuracy, environmental pollution, deep damage layer, etc. A soft abrasive wheel combining chemical and medical effect was developed in this paper, it could get super smooth, low damage wafer surface by utilizing mechanical friction of abrasives and chemical reaction among <b>abrasives,</b> <b>additives,</b> silicon. A comparison experiment between # 3000 soft abrasive wheel and # 3000 diamond abrasive wheel was given to study on the grinding performance of soft abrasive wheel. The results showed that: wafer surface roughness ground by soft abrasive wheel was sub-nanometer and its sub-surface damage was only 0. 01 µm amorphous layer, which were much better than silicon wafer ground by diamond abrasive wheel, but material removal rate and grinding ratio of soft abrasive wheel were lower than diamond wheel. The wafer surface ground by soft abrasive wheel included Ce 4 +, Ce 3 +, Si 4 +, Ca 2 + and Si, which indicated that the chemical reaction really occurred during grinding process...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{isolation}} of the billion or so active components in each integrated device is achieved using shallow trench isolation (STI) which requires chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) involving silicon dioxide removal at a high rate and stopping on an underlying silicon nitride film. Several colloidal slurries with various additives can yield the desired high rate selectivity between the oxide and nitride films during CMP while maintaining an acceptably low nitride rate. Here, many of such high selectivity STI CMP slurries described in the literature are reviewed along with {{the characteristics of the}} colloidal dispersions like the <b>abrasives,</b> <b>additives,</b> the interactions between them and with the films being planarized and the associated pH range in which the high selectivity is observed. The mechanisms proposed to explain the high reactivity of ceria with oxide, the role of additives in suppressing the nitride removal rate and resulting high selectivity are discussed. Reduction of a multitude of defects in post-CMP processed STI structures still remains an important challenge, especially as the feature sizes continue to shrink. © The Author(s) 2015.

40|$|Ceria based {{slurries}} with additives {{are widely}} used in shallow trench isolation (STI) chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process to obtain high selective removal of silicon dioxide over silicon nitride. In this study ceria from different sources were used as abrasives and L-proline and L-glutamic acid were used as additives, {{with a focus on}} identifying the interactions between <b>abrasives</b> and <b>additives</b> and their effect of selectivity. Ceria particles were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) while the <b>additive</b> <b>abrasive</b> interactions were evaluated by UV-Visible spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis. While slurries with L-proline yielded high selectivity only with certain type of ceria, slurries with L-glutamic acid were found to be less sensitive to the ceria source than those with L-proline, and yielded high selectivity regardless of the source of ceria used. The purity of the abrasive and its crystal structure appear to {{play a significant role in}} determining the selectivity...|$|R
40|$|Over {{time the}} harsh outdoor {{environment}} wears away at asphalt surfaces. Asphalt emulsion is sprayed {{onto the surface}} {{to act as a}} sacrificial barrier. To pump this asphalt emulsion for spray application an effective pressure relief device must be incorporated. High pressure is needed to achieve the desired spray pattern, but this same pressure can cause components to fail {{in the presence of a}} pressure spike. Hydraulically driven positive displacement pumps are used to pump the emulsion, so a pinched hoses or a clog in the system results in a severe pressure spike. Due to the emulsions viscosity and <b>abrasive</b> <b>additives</b> a direct relief device is not suitable for long term service. A remote activated pressure relief device is needed to allow adequate spray pressure and prevent system failure. The device is manufactured with off the shelf hydraulic and pneumatic parts bolted to a steel base plate. A pilot pressure is taken from the emulsion circuit and feeds a pneumatic cylinder that pulls a linearly actuated hydraulic valve, in turn diverting the hydraulic flow to the reservoir instead of driving the pump. The pull of the cylinder is balanced by an adjustable spring to allow for different pressure settings. After installing the pressure relief device pressure was be measured at different locations throughout the system. The emulsion pressure relief device performed an as engineered and the pressure remained between 50 and 90 psi. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|A new soft {{abrasive}} {{grinding wheel}} (SAGW) used in chemo-mechanical grinding (CMG) {{was developed for}} machining silicon wafers. The wheel consisted of magnesia (MgO) soft abrasives, calcium carbonate (CaCO) additives and magnesium oxychloride bond. Surface topography, roughness and subsurface damage of the silicon wafers ground using the new SAGW were comprehensively investigated. The {{results showed that the}} grinding with the new SAGW produced a surface roughness of about 0. 5 nm in R and a subsurface damage layer of about 10 nm in thickness, which is comparable to that produced by chemo-mechanical polishing. This study also revealed that the chemical reactions between MgO <b>abrasive,</b> CaCO <b>additives</b> and silicon material did occur during grinding, thereby generating a soft reactant layer on the ground surface. The reactant layer was easily removed during the grinding process...|$|R

This study aims {{to develop}} a {{polishing}} process improvement technology for deep micro-hole knockout hole wall with high aspect ratio, and discuss the optimal polishing parameter combination of abrasive jet machining method and micro-elastic abrasive particles for deep micro-hole knockout hole wall surface.

40|$|Abstract. The {{growth of}} {{epitaxial}} layer of SiC wafer requires {{the surface of}} SiC substrate to reach an atomic scale accuracy. To {{solve the problems of}} low machining efficiency and low surface accuracy in the polishing process of SiC wafer, a novel ultra-precision machining method based on the synergistic effect of chemical reaction and flexible mechanical removal of the magnetorheological (MR) effect, the MR-chemical mechanical polishing (MRCMP) is proposed. In this technique, magnetic particles, <b>abrasives</b> and chemical <b>additives</b> are used as MR-chemical polishing fluid to form a cluster MR-effect flexible polishing platen under an applied magnetic field, and it is expected to realize an atomic scale ultra-smooth surface planarization with good controllability and high material removal rate by using the flexible polishing platen. Polishing experimental results of C surface of 6 H-SiC crystal substrate indicate that an atomic scale zero-defect surface can be obtained. The surface roughness of C surface of SiC wafer decreased from 50. 86 nm to 0. 42 nm and the material removal rate was 98 nm/min when SiC wafer was polished for 60 minutes...|$|R
40|$|Magneto-rheological {{materials}} are {{a class of}} smart materials whose rheological properties can be rapidly varied by applying a magnetic field. Magneto-rheological finishing utilizes magneto-rheological fluid, which consists of magnetic particles, non-magnetic <b>abrasives</b> and some <b>additives</b> in water or other carrier to polish the materials. Single-point diamond turning is able to remove hundreds of microns of material and generate surface with micron accuracies. Residual turning marks {{are the most important}} factor limiting the performance in diamond turning process. Magneto-rheological finishing has inherent ability to improve micro-roughness, remove subsurface damage and reduce residual stresses induced during diamond turning process. Combining single-point diamond turning and magneto-rheological finishing creates a deterministic process for manufacturing highly finished surfaces. In this article, an attempt has been made to improve the finish of diamond turned surface with magneto-rheological finishing and to investigate the effects of parameters like current, spacing, wheel speed, feed rate and magnetic field on the final surface finish. Based on the parametric study, an optimum combination of process parameters is identified using analysis of variance. Various image processing techniques have been used for the comparison of the surface analysis of diamond turned surfaces and the magneto-rheological finished surfaces...|$|R
