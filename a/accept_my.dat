500|$|Madonna {{later said}} {{that the end of}} the video was [...] "my attempt to embrace and <b>accept</b> <b>my</b> mother's death". According to feminist writer E. Ann Kaplan, the video is said to have taken stylistic {{inspiration}} from the 1941 Orson Welles film, Citizen Kane. She described the video as a [...] "typical adolescent story in Western cultural terms". It foregrounds Madonna's repressive Catholic upbringing and her conflicted relationship not only to her literal father in the video, but also a symbolic one—the Holy Father, the Law and the Patriarchy.|$|E

500|$|Tamasin and her brother, Daniel, {{and their}} mother, Jill Balcon, {{stayed at the}} house for five weeks, until Cecil died on 22 May. Jane wrote: [...] "Nobody was better at getting the utmost {{pleasure}} from the simplest things as Cecil: a bunch of flowers, a toasted bun, a gramophone record... a piece of cherry cake, a new thriller..." [...] He dedicated his final poem, [...] "At Lemmons", to [...] "Jane, Kingsley, Colin, Sargy": [...] "I <b>accept</b> <b>my</b> weakness with my friends' / Good natures sweetening each day my sick room." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the snake}} {{handling}} {{scene at the}} Church of God with Signs and Wonders, the song being sung by the congregation is called [...] "May Glory Protect Us". The song was written by executive producer Paul Rabwin, who was heavily involved in the episode's music production. Rabwin later noted, [...] "I auditioned a bunch of gospel songs [...] I told him I could write one that was better {{and he told me}} to go for it. And I did. [...] Kim loved it.

500|$|Responding to Steiner, Robert Stevens {{provides}} {{examples of}} what he categorises variously as offers, threats and throffers that fail to meet Steiner's definitions. He gives {{an example of an}} intervention he considers a throffer, as opposed to a threat, but in which both compliance and noncompliance are less preferable to the norm. The example is that of someone who makes the demand [...] "either you <b>accept</b> <b>my</b> offer of a handful of beans for your cow, or I kill you". For the subject, keeping the cow is preferred to both compliance and noncompliance with the throffer. Using this and other examples, Stevens argued that Steiner's account of differentiating the three kinds of interventions is incorrect.|$|E
500|$|It is {{possible}} that the marriage with Elisiv had been agreed to already during Harald's first time in Rus', or that they at least had been acquainted. During his service in the Byzantine Empire, Harald composed a love poem which included the verse [...] "Yet the goddess in Russia/ will not <b>accept</b> <b>my</b> gold rings" [...] (whom Snorri Sturluson identifies with Elisiv), although Morkinskinna claims that Harald had to remind Yaroslav of the promised marriage when he returned to Kiev. According to the same source, Harald had spoken with Yaroslav during his first time in Rus', requesting to marry Elisiv, only to be rejected because he was not yet wealthy enough. It is in any case significant that Harald was allowed to marry the daughter of Yaroslav, since his other children were married to figures such as Henry I of France, Andrew I of Hungary and the daughter of Constantine IX.|$|E
500|$|In Rafter's view, this marked [...] "the zenith of MacGregor's celebrity" [...] in South America. He had, {{according}} to his biographer Frank Griffith Dawson, [...] "led his troops with brilliant success"; Sinclair agrees, calling the march a [...] "remarkable feat" [...] demonstrating [...] "genuine military skill". With Bolívar back in Aux Cayes, overall command of the republican armies in Venezuela {{had been given to}} Piar. MacGregor and Piar had several disagreements over the next two months regarding the strategic conduct of the war—{{according to}} the American historian David Bushnell, the Scottish general probably [...] "r afoul of personal and factional rivalries within the patriot camp". In early October 1816 MacGregor left with Josefa for Margarita Island, about [...] off eastern Venezuela, where he hoped to enter the service of General Juan Bautista Arismendi. Soon afterwards he received an acclamatory letter from Bolívar: [...] "The retreat which you had the honour to conduct is in my opinion superior to the conquest of an empire... Please <b>accept</b> <b>my</b> congratulations for the prodigious services you have rendered my country". MacGregor's march to Barcelona would remain prominent in the South American revolutionary narrative for years.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{possible}} that the view of them is echoed in the Midrash: [...] "If thy sons <b>accept</b> <b>My</b> Godhead [...] I shall be their God and bring them into the land; but if they do not observe My covenant in regard either to circumcision or to the Sabbath, they shall not enter the land of promise" [...] (Midrash Genesis Rabbah xlvi.).

2500|$|Former Chelsea coach Luiz Felipe Scolari accused Čech, Michael Ballack and Drogba {{of causing}} his sacking, {{saying that they}} [...] "did not <b>accept</b> <b>my</b> {{training}} methods or my demands". Scolari also claimed that it stemmed from a row {{between him and the}} Czech goalkeeper over the latter's alleged insistence on being given a personal coach. Čech denied the claims saying that he was [...] "disappointed with [...] because never in my life have I had a personal goalkeeping coach".|$|E

2500|$|In his autobiography, Hand {{concedes that}} this was perhaps a mistake and that perhaps he should have re-negotiated the offer. In the foreword, Sather {{expressed}} his disappointment that [...] "he didn't <b>accept</b> <b>my</b> deal because he could have advanced in North America. His progress would have been celebrated." [...] Indeed, Sather also says [...] "At the training camp I {{could see that he}} had a great ability to read the ice and he was the smartest player there other than Wayne Gretzky.

Mother, I hope you can <b>accept</b> <b>my</b> stepmother and maintain harmonious relations with her. If you can't, I'll leave and stay elsewhere."

2500|$|He was {{appointed}} {{editor of the}} Evening Standard in March 1991 and replaced (the by then) [...] Sir David English the following year {{as editor of the}} Daily Mail, after turning down an offer from Rupert Murdoch to edit The Times. Dacre believed that Murdoch [...] "would not <b>accept</b> <b>my</b> desire to edit with freedom". It was his approach to the job of editor—"hard-working, disciplined, confrontational"—which had led Murdoch to attempt to hire him. For the Mail, Dacre was considered important enough for English to become editor-in-chief, considered a means of sidelining someone considered unsackable. After English's death in March 1998, Dacre himself became the Mail Group's editor-in-chief the following July, in addition to remaining as editor of the Daily Mail.|$|E
