5|$|Restoring the {{primitive}} scene {{is not done}} easily nor can it be done completely. Some species are extinct. Given time, an eastern hardwood forest can be regrown to maturity but the chestnut will be missing <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> the roar of pigeon wings. The colorful drapanid finches {{are not to be}} heard again in the lowland forests of Hawaii, nor will the jack-hammer of the ivory-bill ring in southern swamps. The wolf and grizzly bear cannot readily be reintroduced into ranching communities, and the factor of human use of the parks is subject only to regulation, not elimination. Exotic plants, animals, and diseases are here to stay. All these limitations we fully realize. Yet, if the goal cannot be fully achieved it can be approached. A reasonable illusion of primitive America could be recreated, using the utmost in skill, judgment, and ecologic sensitivity. This in our opinion should be the objective of every national park and monument.|$|E
5|$|The {{forecasting}} of the precipitation {{within the}} next six hours {{is often referred to}} as nowcasting. In this time range it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy, as well as other features too small to be resolved by a computer model. A human given the latest radar, satellite and observational data will be able to make a better analysis of the small scale features present <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> be able to make a more accurate forecast for the following few hours. However, there is now expert systems using those data and mesoscale numerical model to make better extrapolation, including evolution of those features in time.|$|E
5|$|This {{alone is}} not enough to protect Pluto; {{perturbations}} from the planets (especially Neptune) could alter Pluto's orbit (such as its orbital precession) over millions of years so that a collision could be possible. Pluto is also protected by its 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune: for every two orbits that Pluto makes around the Sun, Neptune makes three. Each cycle lasts about 495 years. This pattern is such that, in each 495-year cycle, the first time Pluto is near perihelion, Neptune is over 50° behind Pluto. By Pluto's second perihelion, Neptune will have completed a further one and a half of its own orbits, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> be nearly 130° ahead of Pluto. Pluto and Neptune's minimum separation is over 17AU, which is greater than Pluto's minimum separation from Uranus (11AU). The minimum separation between Pluto and Neptune actually occurs near the time of Pluto's aphelion.|$|E

25|$|While the 741 was {{historically}} used in {{audio and}} other sensitive equipment, such use is now rare {{because of the}} improved noise performance of more modern op-amps. Apart from generating noticeable hiss, 741s and other older op-amps may have poor common-mode rejection ratios <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> often introduce cable-borne mains hum and other common-mode interference, such as switch 'clicks', into sensitive equipment.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{complete}} cure, {{although there}} are many options to alleviate the clinical signs. The aim of treatment is to enhance quality of life.

25|$|These {{studies are}} {{possible}} because nuclei {{are surrounded by}} orbiting electrons, which are charged particles that generate small, local magnetic fields that add to or subtract from the external magnetic field, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> partially shield the nuclei. The amount of shielding depends on the exact local environment. For example, a hydrogen bonded to an oxygen will be shielded differently from a hydrogen bonded to a carbon atom. In addition, two hydrogen nuclei can interact via {{a process known as}} spin-spin coupling, if they are on the same molecule, which will split the lines of the spectra in a recognizable way.|$|E
25|$|Gerda and Kay {{are taken}} first by Bucky Boy to the Finnish woman, who takes them further on their journey home in her dog sled. The Lapland woman takes them further in her boat, and the robber girl takes them {{the rest of}} the way in the coach that had been {{stripped}} of its gold plate. They go past the princess, her consort, and the ravens who wave them on. They are now home again in their window box garden in springtime. Old Dreamy tells the viewer that Gerda and Kay will continue on to have more adventures, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> the viewer.|$|E
25|$|Coppicing of willow, alder and poplar {{for energy}} wood has proven commercially successful. The Willow Biomass Project in the United States {{is an example}} of this. In this case the {{coppicing}} is done in a way that an annual or more likely a tri-annual cut can happen. This seems to maximize the production volume from the stand. Such frequent growth means the soils can be easily depleted and so fertlizers are often required. The stock also becomes exhausted after some years <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> be replaced with new plants. The method of harvesting of energy wood can be mechanized by adaptation of specialized agricultural machinery.|$|E

In the discharge of its appellate jurisdiction, the CCJ is the highest municipal court in the Region. In {{the exercise}} of its original jurisdiction, the CCJ will be discharging the functions of an international tribunal applying rules of international law in respect of the interpretation and application of the Treaty <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> be the court of arbitration for trade disputes under the CSME.|$|E
25|$|The book {{repeats the}} mistaken idea that planets {{close to a}} sun will {{gradually}} spin slower until one hemisphere is left always turned to the sun due to tidal locking, citing Mercury as an example. Scientists {{at the time of}} the book's origin thought one side of Mercury always faced the sun, just as one side of the Moon always faces the Earth. In 1965, radio astronomers discovered however that Mercury rotates fast enough for all sides to see exposure to the sun. Scientists further established that Mercury is locked in this spin rate in a stable resonance of 3 spins for every 2 orbits, and it is not slowing <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> never have one side left always turned to the sun.|$|E
25|$|The {{surface of}} the fault is {{creeping}} at less than 0.5cm (0.2in) {{per year in the}} regions of concern. Extreme southern regions of the fault are creeping more quickly, perhaps sufficiently to prevent fault rupture there, but mostly the creep is insufficient to relieve the accumulating forces upon most of the fault <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> not prevent a large earthquake. The creep is sufficient to displace roads, curbs, and sidewalks and so visibly reveal the surface trace in many locations. Creep damage to asphalt road surfaces will usually appear as a series of echelon cracks. Creep effects may be seen also in older structures crossing the fault, some of which have been fitted with expansion joints to accommodate this slow motion.|$|E

25|$|One theory used to {{describe}} pronominal binding is to use index marking rules to determine possible bindings. Index marking rules are rules used to determine which parts of a sentence carry the same reference. Each element in a sentence is given an index, which is a unique identifier of that element. A set of rules can then be applied to modify the index of one element {{to be the same}} as the index of another. Those two elements will then share the same index, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> refer to the same thing. This indexing theory was used as a way {{to describe}} pronominal binding by Noam Chomsky, and expanded upon by James Higginbotham. The theory holds that the binding of pronouns consists of three main parts.|$|E
25|$|Within the chamber, {{electrically}} isolated cylindrical electrodes are placed, whose length {{varies with the}} distance along the pipe. The length of each electrode {{is determined by the}} frequency and power of the driving power source {{and the nature of the}} particle to be accelerated, with shorter segments near the source and longer segments near the target. The mass of the particle has a large effect on the length of the cylindrical electrodes; for example an electron is considerably lighter than a proton <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> generally require a much smaller section of cylindrical electrodes as it accelerates very quickly. Likewise, because its mass is so small, electrons have much less kinetic energy than protons at the same speed. Because of the possibility of electron emissions from highly charged surfaces, the voltages used in the accelerator have an upper limit, so this can't be as simple as just increasing voltage to match increased mass.|$|E
