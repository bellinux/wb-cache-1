50|$|Technical grade sheet mica {{is used in}} {{electrical}} components, electronics, in atomic force microscopy and as window sheets. Other uses include diaphragms for oxygen-breathing equipment, marker dials for navigation compasses, optical filters, pyrometers, thermal regulators, stove and kerosene heater windows, radiation <b>aperture</b> <b>covers</b> for microwave ovens, and micathermic heater elements. Mica is birefringent and is therefore commonly used to make quarter and half wave plates. Specialized applications for sheet mica are found in aerospace components in air-, ground-, and sea-launched missile systems, laser devices, medical electronics and radar systems. Mica is mechanically stable in micrometer-thin sheets which are relatively transparent to radiation (such as alpha particles) while being impervious to most gases. It is therefore used as a window on radiation detectors such as Geiger-Müller tubes.|$|R

40|$|The Infrared Astronomical Satellite is an Explorer Mission and a {{joint venture}} of the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States {{scheduled}} for launch into earth orbit in 1981. The cryogenic system is {{a major part of}} the satellite; it incorporated many unique and state-of-the-art design features to satisfy the requirements of a one-year orbital lifetime, a focal plane temperature less than 4 K, minimal launch weight, and zero-gravity operation.

40|$|Steady-state {{temperature}} distributions {{within the}} enclosed air-space of a compound parabolic concentrating (CPC) solar-energy collector {{have been observed}} with an 18 cm field-of-view Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The dependences of the local and average convective heat-transfer coefficients on the concentration ratio of the collector, its inclination (i. e. {{the slope of the}} collector aperture with respect to the horizontal direction) and the absorber temperature are deduced. The average Nusselt number rises as the inclination of the collector increases, and this effect is enhanced the higher the concentration ratio. The ratio of the convective heat-transfer coefficient from the absorber (to the reflector) and that from the absorber (to the <b>aperture</b> <b>cover)</b> is between 0 Â· 50 and 0 Â· 70 for all the cases investigated.

40|$|The {{influence}} of {{coefficients for the}} three axes of the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) were established to determine the maximum allowable thrust {{difference between the two}} vent nozzles of the <b>aperture</b> <b>cover</b> tank low thrust vent system and their maximum misalignment. Test data generated by flow and torque measurements permitted the selection of two nozzles whose thrust differential was within the limit of the attitude control capability. Based on thrust stand data, a thrust vector misalignment was indicated that was slightly higher than permissible for the worst case, i. e., considerable degradation of the torque capacity of the attitude control system combined with venting of helium at its upper limit. The probability of destabilizing the IRAS spacecraft by activating the venting system appeared to be very low. The selection and mounting of the nozzles have satisfied all the requirements for the safe venting of helium...|$|E

Above him was an arched roof and on either hand walls pierced at intervals by <b>apertures</b> <b>covered</b> with wooden doors. Just ahead of him in the roof of the aqueduct was a round, black hole about thirty inches in diameter. His eyes still rested upon the opening when there shot downward from it to the water below the naked body of a human being which almost immediately rose to the surface again and floated off down the stream. In the dim light Bradley saw that it was a dead Wieroo from which the wings and head had been removed. A moment later another headless body floated past, recalling what An-Tak had told him of the skull-collecting customs of the Wieroo. Bradley wondered how it happened that the first corpse he had encountered in the stream had not been similarly mutilated.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an intermediate level circuit model (ILCM) for {{the prediction of}} the shielding effectiveness (SE) of a rectangular box containing one or more rectangular gaskets of known transfer impedance or constitutive parameters. The box may also possess a rectangular <b>aperture</b> <b>covered</b> by a thin resistive sheet. The ILCM takes into account multiple waveguide modes and is thus suitable for use at high frequencies and with relatively large boxes. The gaskets may be positioned anywhere in the irradiated front face of the box, and the SE at any point within the box may be found when irradiated by a plane wave. Solution times using the ILCM technique are three orders of magnitude less than those required by traditional numerical methods such as finite difference time domain (FDTD), transmission line matrix (TLM), or method of moments (MoM), even when using a relatively slow interpreted language such as MATLAB. Accuracy, however, is not significantly compromised. Comparing the circuit model with TLM over eight data sets from 4 MHz to 3 GHz resulted in an rms difference of 3. 90 dB and a mean absolute difference of 2. 35 dB in the predicted SE values. The ILCM accurately reproduces the detailed structure of the SE curves {{as a function of}} frequency and observation point...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new solar thermal {{collector}} which is suitable for providing heat for endothermic chemical reactions. The particular reaction that is considered is hydrogen production by menthol reforming. The design presented here is based on CPC (compound parabolic concentrator) technology, which can operate without complicated (and costly) tracking systems. It consists of a small, double-sided selective surface receiver in a vacuum envelope comprised of CPC reflectors and a glass <b>aperture</b> <b>cover.</b> Heat absorbed by the receiver is transferred to the working fluid inside micro tubes where the chemical reaction is occurring. This design, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, represents the first time that a vacuum package (which creates thermal concentration) has been combined with a CPC-based optical concentrator for thermo-chemical applications. This collector design can convert over 78 % of incident solar radiation into heat with a concentration ratio of 1. 75, allowing for a high solar-to-fuel efficiency in chemical reactions. This study establishes both the optical and thermal models needed to predict the performance of this type of collector. The results show that the collector stagnates at very high temperatures (up to 600. °C), and can provide solar heat in the form of a small collector for a variety of portable applications - e. g. methanol reforming that requires temperatures of around 250. °C...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. April 2013. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: Dr. Jane H. Davidson. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 61 pages, appendices A-D. A water-cooled, cavity calorimeter {{was designed to}} accurately measure concentrated solar thermal power produced by the University of Minnesota's solar simulator. The cavity is comprised of copper tubing bent into spiral and helical coils for the base and cylindrical walls, respectively. Insulation surrounds the cavity to reduce heat transfer to the ambient, and a water- cooled <b>aperture</b> <b>cover</b> is positioned at the open end of the cavity. The calorimeter measures the heat gain of water flowing through the system as radiant energy is passed through the aperture. Chilled water flows through the tubing, and the energy incident on the cavity surface is conducted through the wall and convected to the flowing water. The energy increase in the water can be observed {{by an increase in}} fluid temperature. A Monte Carlo ray tracing method is used to predict the incident flux distribution and corresponding power on the surfaces of the cavity. These values are used to estimate the thermal losses of the system, and it is found that they account for less that 1 % of the total power passed through the aperture. The overall uncertainty of the calorimeter is found by summing the measured uncertainty and the estimated heat loss and is found to be ± 2. 5 % for 9. 2 kW of power output and ± 3. 4 % for 3 kW...|$|E
