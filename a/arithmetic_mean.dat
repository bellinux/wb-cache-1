The ANOVA test used to reveal whether the “Social School Behavior Scales” (SSBS) <b>arithmetic</b> <b>means</b> vary significantly depending on the families’ educational level showed that the difference in the <b>arithmetic</b> <b>means</b> of their educational level is statistically significant in all the sub-scales, except for the sub-scale “interpersonal skills” (p<. 05). According to another result of the study, the differences in the <b>arithmetic</b> <b>means</b> of marital satisfaction level in the subscales of SSBS's “antisocial-aggressive” and “demanding-disruptive” were found to be statistically difference (p<. 05) as a result of the ANOVA test applied to determine whether the SSBS <b>arithmetic</b> <b>means</b> vary significantly depending on the families’ marital satisfaction level...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} {{conducting}} a faecal egg count reduction test was simulated {{to examine whether}} <b>arithmetic</b> or geometric <b>means</b> offer the best estimate of efficacy {{in a situation where}} the true efficacy is known. Two components of sample variation were simulated: selecting hosts from the general population which was modelled by the negative binomial distribution (NBD), and taking an aliquot of faeces from the selected host to estimate the worm egg count by assuming a Poisson distribution of sample counts. Geometric mean counts were determined by adding a constant (C) to each count prior to log transformation, C was set at 25, 12 or 1. Ten thousand Monte Carlo simulations were run to estimate mean efficacy, the 2. 5 % (lower) and the 97. 5 % (upper) percentile based on <b>arithmetic</b> or geometric <b>means.</b> <b>Arithmetic</b> <b>means</b> best estimated efficacy for all different levels of worm aggregation.
