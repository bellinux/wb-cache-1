40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 - 12 Researchers {{utilizing}} {{quantitative methods}} have established that sexual violence against Native <b>American</b> <b>women</b> is a severe and persistent problem in Native American communities. Currently, Native <b>American</b> <b>women</b> suffer {{some of the}} highest and most violent rates of sexual victimization in the United States; experts estimate that between one-third and one-fourth of Native <b>American</b> <b>women</b> will be sexually victimized in their lifetimes. Researchers conducting qualitative research on sexual violence against Native <b>American</b> <b>women</b> have explained that, not only are Native <b>American</b> <b>women</b> outraged and highly critical of this issue, but that Native <b>American</b> <b>women</b> desire for their perspectives, knowledge, and experiences to be legitimized and validated. Additionally, scholars from a variety of disciplines have also demonstrated that sexual violence against Native <b>American</b> <b>women</b> must be contextualized within the historical and intersecting legacies of colonialism, sexism, racism, and genocide. However, qualitative, interview-based research in the field of sexual violence against Native <b>American</b> <b>women</b> has not been widely pursued and has thus afforded the women whom this issue most affects extremely limited opportunities to speak out about sexual violence in their communities. This research, then, based on feminist methodology and practices, was an effort to fill this gap and prioritize the voices of Native <b>American</b> <b>women.</b> I conducted semi-structured interviews with three Native <b>American</b> <b>women</b> from a tribe in the greater Tacoma area about their perspectives and experiences regarding sexual violence against Native <b>American</b> <b>women</b> in their community. As a result of this research, the overarching argument I make is twofold. I contend that, as researchers, we must make a conscious effort to acknowledge, validate, and legitimize the knowledge Native <b>American</b> <b>women</b> have of colonialism and how it intersects with sexual violence and violent victimizations against Native <b>American</b> <b>women</b> and other community members. In doing so, we can support the activism that is already present in Native American communities and encourage the empowerment of Native <b>American</b> <b>women</b> and community members to continuously deconstruct intersecting oppressions and decolonize their communities...|$|R
5000|$|The {{march was}} also {{intended}} {{to draw attention}} to statistics that marginalize African <b>American</b> <b>women.</b> Research has shown that 94 of 1,000 African American teenage girls are victims of violent crime. African <b>American</b> <b>women</b> are eighteen times more likely to get AIDS than white women. In 1996, African American men earned thirty dollars more than African <b>American</b> <b>women</b> per week, while, African <b>American</b> <b>women</b> were paid forty dollars less than white women per week. From these statistics, African <b>American</b> <b>women</b> and supporters wanted to take a stand, and part of the protest was because of inequalities like these.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} culture in shaping perceptions, definitions, and interpretations Mexican American and Anglo <b>American</b> <b>women</b> hold of domestic abuse. Two theoretical views concerning perceptions that Mexican Americans may hold of domestic abuse are discussed. The first view suggests that Mexican <b>American</b> <b>women</b> follow a pluralist model and therefore differ significantly in their perceptions of domestic abuse from Anglo <b>American</b> <b>women.</b> The second position holds that Mexican <b>American</b> <b>women</b> are quickly becoming assimilated into the American mainstream and consequently share attitudes toward domestic abuse {{similar to those of}} Anglo <b>American</b> <b>women.</b> Interviews were conducted with women living in shelters for battered women in 1986. The findings suggest that for Mexican <b>American</b> <b>women,</b> cultural pluralism, rather than assimilation, may be the norm in understanding their perceptions of domestic abuse...|$|R

40|$|Using two {{focus groups}} with 8 Hispanic and 9 Hispanic <b>American</b> <b>women,</b> this study {{compared}} health beliefs and attitudes between Hispanic and <b>American</b> <b>women.</b> This study identified strategies that {{both groups of}} women use to negotiate health information from two distinct health cultures: traditional Hispanic culture and American clinical culture. Findings indicate that both Hispanic and Hispanic <b>American</b> <b>women</b> see health as having a physical and psychological component, see themselves as responsible for protecting their health, and practice preventive behaviors. However, Hispanic <b>American</b> <b>women</b> {{do not believe in}} culture-bound syndromes the way Hispanic women do, nor do Hispanic <b>American</b> <b>women</b> believe in a connection between culture-bound syndromes and chronic disease. Interestingly, both groups of women adapt to a clinical health culture in their own way. Hispanic women adopt clinical practices while maintaining their traditional practices. In contrast, Hispanic <b>American</b> <b>women</b> pick and choose practices from traditional and clinical health culture. This study proposes the theory of cultural health hybrid to examine changing health attitudes and beliefs in Hispanic and Hispanic <b>American</b> <b>women.</b> ...|$|R

Although White women had {{a greater risk of}} eating disturbances than African <b>American</b> <b>women</b> as a group, the effect size was notably small.

50|$|Asian <b>American</b> <b>women</b> face {{additional}} barriers as {{a result}} of being both Asian American and female. This idea of being in multiple minority groups is called intersectionality. In comparison to Asian American men, articles revealed that estimated on average Asian <b>American</b> <b>women</b> earned 27-40% less than Asian American men in terms of payment, if the latter is proven to be true the gender gap in terms of payment between Asian men and women is the highest of any racial group. There are many negative stereotypes associated with Asian <b>American</b> <b>women</b> that could have contributed to this salary difference. These stereotypes being the perception of Asian <b>American</b> <b>women</b> as outsiders, ultra-feminine lotus blossoms, dragon ladies, and model minorities. Also, the stereotypes regarding their relationship to men play a role in their discrimination. Historically, Asian <b>American</b> <b>women</b> were overly sexualized and thought off as being devoted and submissive.
