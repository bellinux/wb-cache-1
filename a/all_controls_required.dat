40|$|Control of HVAC {{systems is}} {{critical}} to building energy efficiency and indoor environment. Almost <b>all</b> <b>control</b> systems <b>require</b> real-time measurements. However, the measurements inherently contain errors that inevitably impact the outputs of control systems. Therefore, it is {{of great interest to}} analyze the impacts of the measurement sensitivity and uncertainty on the control of HVAC systems. This article presents a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis method for HVAC optimal control strategies. The critical measurements in a control strategy are identified by using sensitivity analysis. The uncertainty analysis provides information for further risk analysis. A modified exponentially weighted moving average filter is developed and adopted to reduce the uncertainty of control strategies. The sensitivity and uncertainty analysis is conducted on demand-controlled ventilation strategies for multi-zone office buildings. Improvements of the control strategies based on the analysis results are also conducted. Results demonstrate the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis are effective in evaluating control strategies. The accuracy of the control strategy is significantly improved, and the uncertainty is reduced. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

Immunization with MVA/SHIV 89. 6 alone elicited binding antibodies in all animals and neutralizing antibodies in 5 of 15 animals. Both types of antibodies were enhanced by protein boosting. In addition, CD 8 cells exhibiting CM 9 tetramer binding were detected in the subset of animals that were Mamu-A* 01 positive. Animals were challenged intravenously with either SHIV- 89. 6 (Study 1) or the more pathogenic derivative SHIV- 89. 6 P (Study 2). In Study 1, <b>all</b> <b>control</b> and vaccinated animals except one became infected. However, the levels of viremia were as follows: controls > rMVA alone > rMVA + protein. The differences were statistically significant between immunized and control groups but not between the two immunized groups. In Study 2, all animals became infected; however, the vaccinated group exhibited a 5 -fold reduction in peak viremia and a 10 -fold reduction in the postacute phase viremia in comparison to the <b>controls.</b> <b>All</b> of the <b>controls</b> <b>required</b> euthanasia by 10 months after challenge. A relationship between vaccine-induced antibody titers and reduction in virus burden was observed in both studies.

The approach is stated and justified abstractly, demonstrated in detail for a simple example program, and compared with other approaches to the correctness of parallel programs. The abstract formulation is independent of the model of parallelism in the example and can also be applied to nondeterminism not derived from asynchronous parallelism.

Plasmodium knowlesi AMA 1 (PkAMA 1) was produced and purified using similar methodology as for clinical grade PfAMA 1 yielding a pure, conformational intact protein. Combined with the adjuvant CoVaccine HT TM, PkAMA 1 {{was found to be}} highly immunogenic in rabbits and the efficacy of the PkAMA 1 was subsequently tested in a rhesus macaque blood-stage challenge model. Six rhesus monkeys were vaccinated with PkAMA 1 and a control group of 6 were vaccinated with PfAMA 1. A total of 50 mg AMA 1 was administered intramuscularly three times at 4 week intervals. One of six rhesus monkeys vaccinated with PkAMA 1 was able to control parasitaemia, upon blood stage challenge with P. knowlesi H-strain. Four out of the remaining five showed a delay in parasite onset that correlated with functional antibody titres. In the PfAMA 1 vaccinated control group, five out of six animals had to be treated with antimalarials 8 days after challenge; one animal did not become patent during the challenge period. Following a rest period, animals were boosted and challenged again. Four of the six rhesus monkeys vaccinated with PkAMA 1 were able to control the parasitaemia, one had a delayed onset of parasitaemia and one animal was not protected, while <b>all</b> <b>control</b> animals <b>required</b> treatment.

In conventional voltage sourcing grid connected inverters, any mismatch between the synthesized output waveforms of the inverters and the grid voltage will generate large erroneous currents unless a fast current feedback is used. The current <b>control</b> <b>requires</b> rather fast sampling rates and considerable DSP resources {{as well as}} independent hardware for protection. An alternative approach to the voltage sourcing design is to apply an inverter with an Output Current Sourcing (OCS) behaviour.
