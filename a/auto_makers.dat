25|$|By the mid-1920s, {{sales of}} the Model T began to decline due to rising competition. Other <b>auto</b> <b>makers</b> offered payment plans through which {{consumers}} could buy their cars, which usually included more modern mechanical features and styling not available with the Model T.

25|$|When {{the company}} was first founded 30 years earlier, it was ranked among the largest <b>auto</b> <b>makers</b> in the United States; however, {{in the years that}} {{followed}} many other companies long since outstripped Franklin in volume. By the 1920s, production was running about 8,000 per year, soaring to a peak of 14,000 in 1929, although far below the numbers that other companies were achieving. Like other makers of high-priced cars, Franklin was badly hit by the Great Depression.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with retired GM board member Tom Everhart, the film points out that GM killed the EV1 to focus on more immediately profitable enterprises such as its Hummer and truck brands, instead of preparing for future challenges. Ralph Nader, in a brief appearance, points out that <b>auto</b> <b>makers</b> usually only respond to government regulation {{when it comes to}} important advances whether seat belts, airbags, catalytic converters, mileage requirements or, by implication, hybrid/electric cars. The film suggests Toyota supported the production of Toyota Prius hybrid in part as a response to Bill Clinton's Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles and other U.S. Government pressure that was later dropped.|$|E
25|$|During the 1988 Beijing Defence Exhibition, AM General {{presented}} a M998 4x4 to the People's Liberation Army. The PLA didn't show much {{interest to the}} vehicle before the events of Operation Desert Storm, which made them interested in studying the vehicle. The Chinese petroleum industry purchased Hummers through American commercial sources in the mid-1990s. This provided the Chinese <b>auto</b> <b>makers</b> {{with an opportunity to}} examine the vehicle closely and provided an opportunity for reverse engineering. Later in 2003, the EQ2050 made its debut in a car show after a prototype was made in 2002. The vehicle became the preferred candidate in 2004 with 57 vehicles sent to the PLA for trials from 2004 to 2006. The first 100 EQ2050s were made with American-made parts. It passed design trials in 2006. EQ2050s were then delivered to PLA special forces unit in the Guangzhou Military Region. It's known as Mengshi in Chinese.|$|E

25|$|Despite the Rally's {{outstanding}} performance {{on both the}} street and in the market, it was affected {{by a series of}} unexpected problems. Internally, VAM suffered problems with several customer's confusing the Rally SST and the three-door Lerma models and became undecided on which car to buy. Also, the Lerma's high price and relatively plain looks for a high-end luxury model (intended to become VAM's new flagship since the departure of the Matador-based Classic line) meant poor sales that ended way below VAM's expectations for the year. In terms of luxury, VAM gave priority to the Lerma and the high trim American (Concord) models over the Rally line. The Lerma for 1982 was changed from being a single version to two different versions to create a price difference. The final flagship of the company was available as the semi-equipped Lerma 610 and the fully equipped Lerma 620, both in three and five doors. Externally, a set of misguided moves from the Mexican government took their toll on the whole auto industry. First, the legal exemption of up to 500 automobile engines without emission certification was revoked, affecting directly the high performance 4.6/X engine of the Rally GT models. This was followed by a decree banning the importation of automotive luxury accessories affected the whole auto industry. The only way for the <b>auto</b> <b>makers</b> to keep on offering those accessories was to have them either produced or sourced locally, some found a replacement while others did not. In the VAM Rally's case, the list of accessories that were lost included the bullet-shaped sports remote mirrors, power door locks, power windows, electric trunk release, rear spoiler, analog tachometer, rear defroster, the Quartz digital clock, and the center console with armrest and rear ashtray.|$|E

2500|$|Large-volume users (such as <b>auto</b> <b>makers)</b> {{frequently}} use computer-controlled nut drivers. With such machines, {{the computer}} in effect plots a graph of the torque exerted.

2500|$|The {{crisis was}} {{a major factor in}} {{shifting}} Japan's economy away from oil-intensive industries. Investment shifted to industries such as electronics. Japanese <b>auto</b> <b>makers</b> also benefited from the crisis. Increased fuel costs allowed their small, fuel-efficient models to gain market share from the [...] "gas-guzzling" [...] American competition. This triggered a drop in American auto sales that lasted into the 1980s.|$|E

2500|$|The {{collective}} {{reduction in}} national consumption of oil is significant for automotive vehicles. [...] The Act provided tangible financial incentives (tax credits) for operators of hybrid vehicles. [...] It helped fuel competition among <b>auto</b> <b>makers</b> to meet rising demands for fuel-efficient vehicles. [...] Consumer spending, {{and hence the}} national economy, was abetted. [...] Dependence on imported oil was reduced. [...] The national trade deficit was improved. [...] Industry grew for manufacture of these environmentally positive improvements. [...] These positive improvements have been near and long-term in effect.|$|E
2500|$|The Truth in Lending Act of 1968 (TILA) {{resulted}} in honest reporting of effective APRs {{for more than}} a decade. [...] Then in the 1980s, <b>auto</b> <b>makers</b> (and providers of some other durable goods) began to exploit a loophole in the Act and its implementing regulations. Since the Act does not precisely define [...] "Finance Charge" [...] or [...] "Total Sale Price" [...] (terms used in the TILA disclosures), <b>auto</b> <b>makers</b> found they could reduce Finance Charges and increase car price as much as they wanted, provided Total Sale Price was not changed. APRs calculated with the reduced, or eliminated, finance charge became the [...] "below market rate" [...] and [...] "Zero percent APR' loans that were commonly advertised for the next 30 years. [...] "Zero percent APR or $1,000 rebate" [...] is {{the most common form of}} these deceptive loans. [...] The [...] "rebate" [...] is the hidden finance charge, reclassified to car price. [...] If the consumer doesn't accept the [...] "zero percent loan," [...] then he or she does not accrue the extra $1,000 interest on that loan, and this $1,000 is represented as a [...] "rebate." [...] In reality, there is no rebate and no [...] "zero percent loan." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Auto</b> <b>makers</b> {{have been}} aided in this ongoing {{consumer}} deception by the regulators who administer TILA. [...] The current form of disclosure under TILA seems {{designed specifically to}} support the auto makers' deceptive scheme (including the classification of the [...] "rebate" [...] as [...] "down payment," [...] an oddity seemingly unrelated to the basic scheme for understating APRs). [...] Administration of TILA was recently transferred to the new Consumer Finance Protection Bureau which may give cause for hope of reform in the Act and its administration that will restore the consumer protections intended when TILA was enacted.|$|E

2500|$|Press reports {{indicate}} that sanctions have caused Iran’s production of automobiles to fall by about 40% from 2011 levels. Iran produces cars for the domestic market, such as the Khodro, based on licenses from European <b>auto</b> <b>makers</b> such as Renault and Peugeot. The currency collapse has largely overtaken the findings of an IMF forecast, released in October 2012, which Iran would return to economic growth in 2013, after a small decline in 2012. An Economist Intelligence Unit assessment published in late 2012 indicates Iran’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) likely contracted about 3% in 2012 and will contract an additional 1.2% in 2013.

2500|$|The {{hydrogen}} fuel cell was presented by the film as an alternative that distracts attention from the real and immediate potential of electric vehicles to an unlikely future possibility embraced by <b>auto</b> <b>makers,</b> oil companies and a pro-business administration in order to buy time and profits for the status quo. The film corroborates the claim that hydrogen vehicles are a mere distraction by stating that [...] "A fuel cell car powered by hydrogen made with electricity uses {{three to four times}} more energy than a car powered by batteries" [...] and by interviewing Joseph J. Romm, the author of The Hype About Hydrogen, who lists five problems he sees with hydrogen vehicles: High cost, limits on driving range due to current materials, high costs of {{hydrogen fuel}}, the need for entirely new fueling compounds, and competition from other technologies in the marketplace, such as hybrids.|$|E
2500|$|Industry analyst Anthony Faria {{has criticized}} the labour {{contracts}} that Canadian Auto Workers then-president Buzz Hargrove {{negotiated with the}} Big Three US automobile manufacturers in 2007, predicting that the subprime mortgage crisis and currency would hit Canadian auto production especially hard. Faria noted that UAW president Ron Gettelfinger agreed to have the UAW's [...] "all-in" [...] wage, benefit and pension costs drop {{from a high of}} $75.86 per hour in 2007 to an average of about $51 per hour starting in 2010. By comparison, the CAW's cost per hour was $77 in 2007 and will rise to over $80 per hour {{by the end of the}} new contract. Faria said that Gettelfinger went into negotiations [...] "with the right intention...Save jobs. The CAW strategy was to squeeze every dime out of them." [...] Hargrove was said to have [...] "instilled backbone and an attitude that the union could always make the <b>auto</b> <b>makers</b> buckle at the bargaining table".|$|E
