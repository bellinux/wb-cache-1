5|$|The Uniforms of the Confederate States {{military}} forces were the uniforms {{used by the}} Confederate Army and Navy during the American Civil War, from 1861 to 1865.

5|$|Anthozoa is a {{class of}} marine {{invertebrates}} which includes the sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals and gorgonians. Adult anthozoans are almost all attached to the seabed, while their larvae can disperse {{as part of the}} plankton. The basic unit of the adult is the polyp; this consists of a cylindrical column topped by a disc with a central mouth surrounded by tentacles. Sea anemones are mostly solitary, but the majority of corals are colonial, being formed by the budding of new polyps from an original, founding individual. Colonies are strengthened by calcium carbonate <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>materials</b> and take various massive, plate-like, bushy or leafy forms.|$|E

5|$|Because of its {{excellent}} thermal {{and chemical}} stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used {{as parts of}} high-temperature equipment. h-BN can be included in ceramics, alloys, resins, plastics, rubbers, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>materials,</b> giving them self-lubricating properties. Such materials are suitable for construction of e.g. bearings and in steelmaking. Plastics filled with BN have less thermal expansion as well as higher thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity. Due to its excellent dielectric and thermal properties, BN is used in electronics e.g. as a substrate for semiconductors, microwave-transparent windows and as a structural material for seals. It {{can also be used}} as dielectric in resistive random access memories.|$|E
5|$|Before {{his death}} Tolkien {{negotiated}} {{the sale of}} the manuscripts, drafts, proofs <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>materials</b> related to his then-published works—including The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit and Farmer Giles of Ham—to the Department of Special Collections and University Archives at Marquette University's John P.

5|$|Cleaning {{symbiosis}} is {{a mutually}} beneficial association between individuals of two species, where one (the cleaner) removes and eats parasites <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>materials</b> {{from the surface}} of the other (the client). Cleaning symbiosis is well-known among marine fish, where some small species of cleaner fish, notably wrasses but also species in other genera, are specialised to feed almost exclusively by cleaning larger fish and other marine animals. Other cleaning symbioses exist between birds and mammals, and in other groups.|$|E
5|$|Diverse {{geographic}} destinations and cabin pressurisation alike on the Comet {{demanded the}} use of a high proportion of alloys, plastics, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>materials</b> new to civil aviation across the aircraft in order to meet certification requirements. The Comet's high cabin pressure and fast operating speeds were unprecedented in commercial aviation, making its fuselage design an experimental process. At its introduction, Comet airframes would be subjected to an intense, high-speed operating schedule which included simultaneous extreme heat from desert airfields and frosty cold from the kerosene-filled fuel tanks, still cold from cruising at high altitude.|$|E
5|$|Dr. John Lescher was a {{business}} partner and friend of Thomas S. Hinde. Both men invested in the Wabash Navigation Company. Lescher later joined Hinde's children in {{a lawsuit against the}} company. Not long after the death of Hinde, his son James and his son-in-law Charles H. Constable joined with Lescher and sued the company for entering their land and taking timber <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>materials</b> for the construction of dam. But, the company's charter permitted them to enter the land and take construction material without the owner's consent, forcing the owner to seek legal redress. The court ordered compensation.|$|E

5|$|Etruscan {{architecture}} {{was created}} between about 700 BC and 200 BC, when the expanding civilization of ancient Rome finally absorbed Etruscan civilization. The Etruscans were considerable builders in stone, wood <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>materials</b> of temples, houses, tombs and city walls, {{as well as}} bridges and roads. The only structures remaining in quantity in anything like their original condition are tombs and walls, but through archaeology and other sources {{we have a good}} deal of information on what once existed.|$|E
5|$|Flint scrapers, knives <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>materials</b> {{associated}} with neolithic humans were discovered on the moor {{in the late}} 19th and early 20th century by local antiquarians such as Charles Roeder.

There was a Roman camp at Rainsough just to the west, and some have speculated {{that there may have been}} a second camp to the east, in the area known as Castle Hill, making a defensive line across the moor to protect the north of Mamucium.|$|E
