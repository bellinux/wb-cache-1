40|$|LecturePg. 79 - 86 <b>Abradable</b> <b>seals</b> are {{employed}} in turbomachinery to reduce leakage gaps between stationary and rotating parts to improve efficiency and stall margin. Thermally sprayed <b>abradable</b> <b>seals</b> {{have been used in}} the compressor section of jet engines since the late 1960 s. These seals are predominantly coatings made from composite material that derive their abradability from the use of low shear strength materials or form a porous, friable coating structure. Due to the extreme temperatures on the turbine side of gas turbine engines, brazed or welded metallic structures made from nickel (Ni) based alloys have typically been used to provide gas path sealing. When thermal shock resistant ceramics because available, oxide ceramic, mostly zirconia based high temperature <b>abradable</b> <b>seals</b> for the high pressure turbine stages were developed. For the highest temperature stages, thermally sprayed oxide ceramics with or without metallic strain isolators are frequently used. On stages with reduced temperatures both ceramic and metallic coatings of the McrA 1 Y type can be used. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in compressor and turbine clearance control materials and systems, whereby a focus is placed on novel thermally sprayed ceramic turbine seals with encouraging property combinations, which are achieved by the introduction of alternative stabilizers.

The investigation of a variety of candidate fillers, with hardness values as low as 2 on Moh's scale, led to the conclusion that solid filler materials in combination with a YSZ matrix, regardless of their hardness values, have a propensity for compacting rather than shearing as originally expected. The observed compaction is accompanied by high energy dissipation in the rub interaction, usually resulting in the adhesive transfer of blade material to the stationary seal member. Two YSZ based coating systems which incorported hollow alumino silicate spheres as density reducing agents were surveyed over the entire range of compositions from 100 percent filler to 100 percent YSZ.

The abradability of the material was found to be excellent with no damage to the rotating member. For rub tolerant polymer seals little data are available on the effects of an aggressive rub with relation to deflection and wear at various temperatures. A series of test was done on labyrinth seals manufactured from various forms of carbon fill polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and polyamideimide (PAI). these test evaluated their mechanical performance at low temperatures, room temperatures, and high temperatures. The results of the tests indicated that at room temperature and low temperatures, the seals exhibited acceptable deflection properties without damage to the rotating shaft and minimal material loss from the labyrinth teeth. However, at high temperatures of 150 ?F, the PAI material had greater deflection values than the two types of PEEK, which resulted in the PAI exhibiting greater tooth height loss compared to the PEEK materials.

The speed exponent increases with the increase of the impact angle. At 90 Â° impact, the abrasive particles impinging on the coating surface produce indentations and extruded lips, and then the lips are work-hardened and fall off; and flattened metal phase grains are impacted repeatedly, loosed and debonded.

To investigate the high-speed scraping behavior between a vulcanized silicone rubber and a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V fan blade and evaluate the abradable performance of seal rubber, abrasion tests were conducted at a blade tip velocity of 50 â€“ 300 Â m/s with an incursion rate of 100 Â Î¼m/s.

With an increase of the blade tip velocity, both of the final incursion depth and wear mass loss of seal rubber exhibit growth trends. The gradual changes of rubbing forces with an increase of rubbing time are the characteristic of abrasive wear, and force curves with unstable mutations are a reflection of pattern wear. At a constant incursion rate of 100 Â Î¼m/s, the maximum values of interaction forces decrease first and then grow with an increase of the blade tip velocity, and the blade tip velocity of 150 Â m/s becomes the cut-off point between abrasive wear and pattern wear...|$|E

Such thermal spray coatings are used extensively within the gas turbine, {{applied to the}} inner surface of compressor and turbine shroud sections, coating {{the periphery of the}} blade rotation path. The function of an <b>abradable</b> <b>seal</b> is to wear preferentially when rotating blades come into contact with it, while minimizing over-tip clearance and improving the efficiency of the engine. Thermal spraying of an abradable coating onto a substrate imparts two components of residual stress; rapid quenching stresses as the spray material cools on impact and stresses arising from differential thermal contraction. In-service thermal stresses are superimposed by the differential expansion of these bonded layers. The combination of the production and operation history will lead to thermal-mechanical fatigue damage within the abradable coating. The present paper will describe the numerical modeling and sensitivity analysis of the thermal spray process. The sensitivity of residual stresses (with varying material properties, coating/substrate thickness, Poisson's ratio, and substrate temperature) predicted by the Tsui and Clyne progressive deposition model enabled identification of performance drivers to coating integrity.

Plasma spraying is part of thermal spraying which is a group of processes in which finely divided metallic and non metallic materials are deposited in a molten or semi-molten state on a prepared substrate to form a spray deposit [1, 2]. In this process the substrate can be kept at relatively low temperature by specific cooling devices. In fact thermal spray has been practiced since the early 1900 's [3]. Historically a surfacing technology, it has now moved from coating to materials processing technology with growing importance as stated by Smith [4]. DC plasma spraying, f i s t proposed by Reineke in 1939 [4], was advanced in the late 1950 s by several US companies. The high gas velocity DC arc torches were developed in the early 1970 's by Pratt and Whitney with the Gator Gard (licenced to Sermatech [5]) and in the late 1980 's by Browning with the high energy, high velocity Plazjet (licenced to a Japanese company [6]).

40|$|International audienceImproving sealing between {{rotating}} and stationary {{parts in}} aerospace gas turbines significantly increases engine performance by improving thermal efficiencies. To reach this aim, abradable seals are being incorporated into turbine casings. With an <b>abradable</b> <b>seal,</b> the blade tips incur into the shroud, {{thereby reducing the}} gap between the rotor and the coating to a minimum. These coatings are generally multiphase materials applied by thermal spray techniques and consisting in a combination of metallic matrix and additional dislocator phases with a controlled amount of porosity. The sealing effectiveness requires a combination of properties that are usually optimised empirically with thermal spray coatings generally made up from a range of two-phase powder mixtures. The present study intends to initiate a theoretical approach for the study of these materials aiming at developing a prediction strategy for structure improvement. Image analyses and finite element calculations were used to examine the effect of phase morphology on the mechanical behaviour of two reference abradable systems, namely AlSi-hBN and NiCrAl-Bentonite for compressor stages. Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM) was used to obtain a series of micrographs for coating characterisation. These micrographs were then treated to create equivalent images based on geometrical description of the inherent morphology. The resultant reduced images are used to carry out finite element calculations, {{in order to determine the}} mechanical properties of each coating. It is believed that this approach provides consistent results and is believed to be a reliable starting point for further coatings design...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{results are}} {{presented}} for the case of titanium blade specimens, with bare tips (or covered with wear resistant, plasma sprayed materials) rubbing at 100 m/s against specimens of <b>abradable</b> nickel-chromium <b>seal</b> material moving toward the rotating blades at 0. 0125 mm/s or at 0. 025 mm/s. Using a two component dynamometer, the normal force of the rub interaction was measured and the shear component estimated. The elastoplastic properties of the seal material have been determined and those parameters {{as well as the}} rigidity of the rub tester system are considered in conjunction with those affecting the accuracy of the measurement of the forces arising at the blade-seal interface. The average and the 'local instantaneous' temperatures of the seal specimen and the temperature of the blade tip surface during rubbing are presented as functions of time. A seal densification factor is defined and its functional relationships with contact force components, temperature, wear ratio and blade tip abrading capability are indicated...|$|R
40|$|An <b>abradable</b> {{buffered}} labyrinth <b>seal</b> for {{the control}} of turbine gas path leakage in a tip-turbine driven lift fan was designed, tested, and analyzed. The seal configuration was not designed to operate in any specific location but was sized to be evaluated in an existing test rig. The final sealing diameter selected was 28 inches. Results of testing indicate that the flow equations predicted seal air flows consistent with measured values. Excellent sealing characteristics of the abradable coating on the stator land were demonstrated when a substantial seal penetration of. 030 inch into the land surface was encountered without appreciable wear on the labyrinth knife edges...|$|R
40|$|Three <b>abradable</b> {{gas path}} <b>seal</b> {{material}} systems {{based on a}} sintered NiCrAlY fibermetal structure were evaluated under a range of wear conditions representative of those likely to be encountered in various knife-edge seal (labyrinth or shrouded turbine) applications. Conditions leading to undesirable wear of the rotating knife were identified and a model was proposed based on thermal effects arising under different rub conditions. It was found, and predicted by the model, that low incursion (plunge) rates tended to promote smearing of the low density sintered material with consequent wear to the knife-edge. Tradeoffs benefits between baseline 19 percent dense material, a similar material of increased density, and a self lubricating coating applied to the 19 percent material were identified based on relative rub tolerance and erosion resistance...|$|R
