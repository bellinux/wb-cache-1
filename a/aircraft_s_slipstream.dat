40|$|Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) {{concepts}} of operation may require aircraft to fly planned trajectories in four dimensions three spatial dimensions and time. A prototype 4 D flight management capability {{is being developed}} by NASA to facilitate {{the development of these}} concepts. New trajectory generation functions extend today's flight management system (FMS) capabilities that meet a single Required Time of Arrival (RTA) to trajectory solutions that comply with multiple RTA constraints. When a solution is not possible, a constraint management capability relaxes constraints to achieve a trajectory solution that meets the most important constraints as specified by candidate NextGen concepts. New flight guidance functions provide continuous guidance to the <b>aircraft</b> <b>s</b> flight control system to enable it to fly specified 4 D trajectories. Guidance options developed for research investigations include a moving time window with varying tolerances that are a function of proximity to imposed constraints, and guidance that recalculates the <b>aircraft</b> <b>s</b> planned trajectory {{as a function of the}} estimation of current compliance. Compliance tolerances are related to required navigation performance (RNP) through the extension of existing RNP concepts for lateral containment. A conceptual temporal RNP implementation and prototype display symbology are proposed...|$|R

Propulsion system mass and performance greatly influence the <b>aircraft</b> <b>s</b> design and mission capabilities. Various {{propulsion system}}s were analyzed to estimate the system mass necessary for producing 35 N of thrust within the Mars environment.

40|$|An {{optical link}} from Earth to an {{aircraft}} demonstrates {{the ability to}} establish a link from a ground platform to a transceiver moving overhead. An airplane has a challenging disturbance environment including airframe vibrations and occasional abrupt changes in attitude during flight. These disturbances {{make it difficult to}} maintain pointing lock in an optical transceiver in an airplane. Acquisition can also be challenging. In the case of the aircraft link, the ground station initially has no precise knowledge of the <b>aircraft</b> <b>s</b> location. An airborne pointing system has been designed, built, and demonstrated using direct-drive brushless DC motors for passive isolation of pointing disturbances and for high-bandwidth control feedback. The airborne transceiver uses a GPS-INS system to determine the <b>aircraft</b> <b>s</b> position and attitude, and to then illuminate the ground station initially for acquisition. The ground transceiver participates in link-pointing acquisition by first using a wide-field camera to detect initial illumination from the airborne beacon, and to perform coarse pointing. It then transfers control to a high-precision pointing detector. Using this scheme, live video was successfully streamed from the ground to the aircraft at 270 Mb/s while simultaneously downlinking a 50 kb/s data stream from the aircraft to the ground...|$|R

Aside from the wings, the two aircraft shared the basic design as well as the Lyulka AL-7 turbojet engine. Since the T-3 was intended to be an interceptor, it was fitted with the Almaz (Алмаз, Diamond) radar housed in the air intake. The prototype first flew on 26 May 1956.|$|R

40|$|The {{rising cost}} of oil coupled {{with the need to}} reduce {{pollution}} and dependence on foreign suppliers has spurred great interest and activity in developing alternative aviation fuels. Although a variety of fuels have been produced that have similar properties to standard Jet A, detailed studies are required to ascertain the exact impacts of the fuels on engine operation and exhaust composition. In response to this need, NASA acquired and burned a variety of alternative aviation fuel mixtures in the Dryden Flight Research Center DC- 8 to assess changes in the <b>aircraft</b> <b>s</b> CFM- 56 engine performance and emission parameters relative to operation with standard JP- 8. This Alternative Aviation Fuel Experiment, or AAFEX, was conducted at NASA Dryden <b>s</b> <b>Aircraft</b> Operations Facility (DAOF) in Palmdale, California, from January 19 to February 3, 2009 and specifically sought to establish fuel matrix effects on: 1) engine and exhaust gas temperatures and compressor speeds; 2) engine and auxiliary power unit (APU) gas phase and particle emissions and characteristics; and 3) volatile aerosol formation in aging exhaust plume...|$|R

Additionally this paper will present results that, using a full non -linear aircraft model, demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} hybrid control architecture given drastic changes in an <b>aircraft</b> <b>s</b> dynamics.

40|$|The Neural Flight Control System (NFCS) was {{developed}} to address the need for control systems that can be produced and tested at lower cost, easily adapted to prototype vehicles and for flight systems that can accommodate damaged control surfaces or changes to aircraft stability and control characteristics resulting from failures or accidents. NFCS utilizes on a neural network-based flight control algorithm which automatically compensates for {{a broad spectrum of}} unanticipated damage or failures of an aircraft in flight. Pilot stick and rudder pedal inputs are fed into a reference model which produces pitch, roll and yaw rate commands. The reference model frequencies and gains can be set to provide handling quality characteristics suitable for the aircraft of interest. The rate commands are used in conjunction with estimates of the <b>aircraft</b> <b>s</b> stability and control (S&C) derivatives by a simplified Dynamic Inverse controller to produce virtual elevator, aileron and rudder commands. These virtual surface deflection commands are optimally distributed across the <b>aircraft</b> <b>s</b> available control surfaces using linear programming theory. Sensor data is compared with the reference model rate commands to produce an error signal. A Proportional/Integral (PI) error controller "winds up" on the error signal and adds an augmented command to the reference model output with the effect of zeroing the error signal. In order to provide more consistent handling qualities for the pilot, neural networks learn the behavior of the error controller and add in the augmented command before the integrator winds up. In the case of damage sufficient to affect the handling qualities of the aircraft, an Adaptive Critic is utilized to reduce the reference model frequencies and gains to stay within a flyable envelope of the aircraft...|$|R
40|$|Most jet {{airliner}} conceptual designs {{adhere to}} conventional takeoff and landing performance. Given this predominance, takeoff and landing performance {{has not been}} critical, since {{it has not been}} an active constraint in the design. Given that the demand for air travel is projected to increase dramatically, there is interest in operational concepts, such as Metroplex operations that seek to unload the major hub airports by using underutilized surrounding regional airports, as well as using underutilized runways at the major hub airports. Both of these operations require shorter takeoff and landing performance than is currently available for airliners of approximately 100 -passenger capacity. This study examines the issues of modeling performance in this now critical flight regime as well as the impact of progressively reducing takeoff and landing field length requirements on the <b>aircraft</b> <b>s</b> characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The {{acquisition}} of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) {{data in a}} bistatic forward-looking configuration offers many new capabilities for {{a broad spectrum of}} remote sensing applications. A radar system in an aircraft could image the runway during the landing approach to improve landing safety, particularly in poor visibility conditions. First experiments and imaging results demonstrate the feasibility of forward-looking bistatic radar imaging even with a very low elevation angle to the receiver, which is in the order of four degrees for a typical landing approach. The paper presents the challenges of imaging in forward direction and shows experimental results with a moving ground-based transmitter and an approaching aircraft.

40|$|The DROID III project {{consisted}} of two main parts.

Both portions of the project called for flight testing and that data is now available on account of this project. The conclusion of the project is that the performance evaluation data is well-within desired standards but could be improved with a thrust model, and that parameter identification is still in need of more data processing but seems to produce reasonable results thus far...|$|R

40|$|Advances in {{computational}} power {{have produced}} great strides {{in the later}} design and production portions of an <b>aircraft</b> <b>s</b> life cycle, and these advances have included the internal layout component of the design and manufacturing process. However, conceptual and preliminary design tools for internal layout remain primarily based on historical regressions and estimations a situation that becomes untenable when considering revolutionary designs or component technologies. Bringing internal layout information forward in the design process can encourage {{the same level of}} benefits enjoyed by other disciplines as advances in aerodynamics, structures and other fields propagate forward in the design of complex systems. Accurate prediction of the volume required to contain all of an <b>aircraft</b> <b>s</b> internal components results in a more accurate prediction of aircraft specifications, mission effectiveness, and costs, helping determine if an aircraft is the best choice for continued development. This is not a computationally simple problem, however, and great care must be taken to ensure the efficiency of any proposed solution. Any solution must also address the uncertainty inherent in describing internal components early in the design process. Implementing a methodology that applies notions of an intelligent search for a solution, as well as deals robustly with component sizing, produces a high chance of success. Development of a robust, rapid method for assessing the volumetric characteristics of an aircraft {{in the context of the}} conceptual and preliminary design processes can offer many of the benefits of a complete internal layout without the immense assignment of resources typical in the detail phase of the design process. A simplified methodology for volumetrically sizing an aircraft is presented here as well as an assessment of the state-of-the-art techniques for volumetric considerations used in current aircraft design literature. A prototype tool using a combination of original code and publicly available libraries is developed and explored. A sample aircraft design is undertaken with the prototype tool to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology. Ph. D.

40|$|The {{ability of}} a flight crew to deliver their {{aircraft}} to its arrival runway on time {{is important to the}} overall efficiency of the National Airspace System (NAS). Over the past several years, the NAS has been stressed almost to its limits resulting in problems such as airport congestion, flight delay, and flight cancellation to reach levels that have never been seen before in the NAS. It is predicted that this situation will worsen by the year 2025, due to an anticipated increase in air traffic operations to one-and-a-half to three times its current level. Improved arrival efficiency, in terms of both capacity and environmental impact, {{is an important part of}} improving NAS operations. One way to improve the arrival performance of an aircraft is to enable the flight crew to precisely deliver their aircraft to a specified point at either a specified time or specified interval relative to another aircraft. This gives the flight crew more control to make the necessary adjustments to their <b>aircraft</b> <b>s</b> performance with less tactical control from the controller; it may also decrease the controller s workload. Two approaches to precise time navigation have been proposed: Time-Based Arrivals (e. g., required times of arrival) and Self-Spacing. Time-Based Arrivals make use of an <b>aircraft</b> <b>s</b> Flight Management System (FMS) to deliver the aircraft to the runway threshold at a given time. Self-Spacing enables the flight crew to achieve an ATC assigned spacing goals at the runway threshold relative to another aircraft. The Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO), a multi-agency initiative established to plan and coordinate the development of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), has asked for data for both of these concepts to facilitate future research and development. This paper provides a first look at the delivery performance of these two concepts under various initial and environmental conditions in an air traffic simulation environment...|$|R
40|$|Design of a {{terminal}} area arrival scheduler {{depends on the}} interrelationship between throughput, delay and controller intervention. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} an analysis of the above interdependence for several stochastic behaviors of expected system performance distributions in the <b>aircraft</b> <b>s</b> time of arrival at the meter fix and runway. Results of this analysis serve to guide the scheduler design choices for key control variables. Two types of variables are analyzed, separation buffers and terminal delay margins. The choice for these decision variables was tested using sensitivity analysis. Analysis suggests that it is best to set the separation buffer at the meter fix to its minimum and adjust the runway buffer to attain the desired system performance. Delay margin was found to have the least effect. These results help characterize the variables most influential in the scheduling operations of terminal area arrivals...|$|R

The results show a temperature increase of 0 · 08 mK (0 · 07 - 0 · 10 mK) with only small but statistically significant variations between the configurations, leading to a minimum climate impact for a weight optimised and hence lower flying aircraft. A climate impact ratio of 3 · 0 ± 0 · 4 between a S 4 TA and its subsonic counterpart is calculated, which is considerable less than for previous supersonic fleets because of a lower flight altitude, leading to smaller water vapour impacts...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} using engine thrust {{differentials}} {{to compensate for}} rudder and aileron failures in aircraft flight control is addressed in this paper in a new framework.

In this model two engine thrusts of an aircraft can be adjusted independently so as to provide the control flexibility for rudder or aileron failure compensation.
