5|$|Except for <b>Æsthetic</b> Club meetings, the Tower Building {{remained}} largely unoccupied for almost fifty years and suffered significant deterioration. The <b>Æsthetic</b> Club provided much-needed financial support {{during the period}} and even paid the electric bill during the Great Depression. The <b>Æsthetic</b> Club is still headquartered in the Tower Building.|$|E
5|$|It was the <b>aesthetic</b> {{complexity}} of insects that led Nabokov to reject natural selection.|$|E
5|$|Morris’s <b>aesthetic</b> {{and social}} values became a leading {{force in the}} Arts and Crafts Movement. The Kelmscott Press {{influenced}} much of the fine press movement in England and the United States during {{the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries. It brought the need for books that were <b>aesthetic</b> objects as well as words to the attention of the reading and publishing worlds.|$|E
5|$|A common {{interpretation}} of Either/Or presents {{the reader with}} a choice between two approaches to life. There are no standards or guidelines which indicate how to choose. The reasons for choosing an ethical way of life over the <b>aesthetic</b> only make sense if one is already committed to an ethical way of life. Suggesting the <b>aesthetic</b> approach as evil implies one has already accepted {{the idea that there}} is a good/evil distinction to be made. Likewise, choosing an <b>aesthetic</b> way of life only appeals to the aesthete, ruling Judge Vilhelm's ethics as inconsequential and preferring the pleasures of seduction. Thus, existentialists see Victor Eremita as presenting a radical choice in which no pre-ordained value can be discerned. One must choose, and through one's choices, one creates what one is.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aesthetic</b> {{aspects of}} wind {{turbines}} and resulting {{changes of the}} visual landscape are significant. Conflicts arise especially in scenic and heritage protected landscapes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{wind power}} is a popular form of energy generation, the {{construction}} of wind farms is not universally welcomed, often for <b>aesthetic</b> reasons.|$|E
5|$|Apelt, who saw Kepler's mathematics, <b>aesthetic</b> sensibility, {{physical}} ideas, {{and theology}} {{as part of}} a unified system of thought, produced the first extended analysis of Kepler's life and work.|$|E
5|$|Between 1580 and 1600 Jan Zamoyski {{commissioned}} the Venetian architect Bernardo Morando {{to build the}} city of Zamość. The town and its fortifications were designed to consistently implement the Renaissance and Mannerism <b>aesthetic</b> paradigms.|$|E
5|$|Bright Lights Film Journal critic Jayson Harsin {{declared}} the film's <b>aesthetic</b> qualities groundbreaking, {{as a new}} genre of slideshow film.|$|E
5|$|Dietrich’s {{analysis}} {{found that}} rongorongo glyphs {{are governed by}} rules concerning combination, partial elimination, emphasis, iteration, economy, orientation, and <b>aesthetic</b> design.|$|E
5|$|His {{scholarly}} {{writing as}} an <b>Aesthetic</b> Realism consultant showing {{the relation of}} art and life includes considerations of the lives and works of sculptors Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Jacques Lipchitz; painters René Magritte, Giorgio de Chirico, Henri Matisse, Rembrandt, Fernand Léger, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Masaccio; and many American printmakers. He {{is the author of}} The Art of the Print, essays on works of Picasso, Daumier, Munch, Hogarth, and Duane Hanson. His drawings illustrate Siegel's book, Damned Welcome: <b>Aesthetic</b> Realism Maxims (New York: Definition Press, 1972, 2011).|$|E
5|$|Noh {{performance}} {{combines a}} variety of elements into a stylistic whole, with each particular element the product of generations of refinement according to the central Buddhist, Shinto, and minimalist aspects of Noh's <b>aesthetic</b> principles.|$|E
5|$|The Borobudur reliefs {{also pay}} close {{attention}} to Indian <b>aesthetic</b> discipline, such as pose and gesture that contain certain meanings and <b>aesthetic</b> value. The reliefs of noblemen, and noble women, kings, or divine beings such as apsaras, taras and boddhisattvas are usually portrayed in tribhanga pose, the three-bend pose on neck, hips, and knee, with one leg resting and one upholding the body weight. This position is considered as the most graceful pose, such as the figure of Surasundari holding a lotus.|$|E
5|$|The next Gilbert and Sullivan opera, Patience, {{opened at}} the Opera Comique in April 1881 and was another big success, usurping Pinafore's {{position}} as the longest running piece in the series with the second-longest run in musical theatre history. Patience satirised the self-indulgent <b>aesthetic</b> movement of the 1870s and '80s in England. To popularise the opera in America, in 1882 Carte sent one of the artistes under his management, the young poet Oscar Wilde, on a lecture tour to explain to Americans what the <b>aesthetic</b> movement was about. Carte told an interviewer {{at that time that}} he had fifteen theatrical companies and performers touring simultaneously in Europe, America and Australia.|$|E
5|$|Victorian {{painting}} {{had gone}} through radical changes, and by the 1870s the realism of Etty and the Pre-Raphaelites {{had given way to}} the ideas of the <b>Aesthetic</b> Movement, abandoning the traditions of storytelling and moralising in favour of painting works designed for <b>aesthetic</b> appeal rather than for their narrative or subject. Although the <b>aesthetic</b> movement ultimately led to a brief revival of history painting, these works were in a very different style to Etty's. The new generation of history painters such as Edward Burne-Jones, Lawrence Alma-Tadema and Frederic Leighton sought to depict passivity, rather than the dynamism seen in previous works depicting the classical world. By the end of the 19th century, the value of all of Etty's works had fallen below their original prices. As the 20th century began, the increasingly influential Modernist movement, which came to dominate British art in the 20th century, drew its inspiration from Paul Cézanne and had little regard for 19th-century British painting.|$|E
5|$|While <b>aesthetic</b> {{issues are}} {{subjective}} and some find wind farms pleasant and optimistic, or symbols of energy independence and local prosperity, protest groups are often formed {{to attempt to}} block new wind power sites for various reasons.|$|E
5|$|Although van der Weyden did not {{adhere to}} the {{conventions}} of idealisation, he generally sought to flatter his sitters. He depicted his models in highly fashionable clothing, often with rounded—almost sculpted—facial features, some of which deviated from natural representation. He adapted his own <b>aesthetic,</b> and his portraits of women often bear {{a striking resemblance to}} each other.|$|E
5|$|Both {{panel and}} frame {{are in good}} condition. That the panel retains its {{original}} frame makes it especially interesting to art historians, apart from its <b>aesthetic</b> qualities. The canvas has suffered little paint loss, board cracking, or other damage, and has been cleaned several times since it came into the possession of the Groeningemuseum.|$|E
5|$|Early {{contributions}} to design management show how different design disciplines were coordinated to achieve business objectives at a corporate level, and demonstrate the early understanding of design as a competitive force. In that context, design was merely {{understood as an}} <b>aesthetic</b> function, and the management of design was {{at the level of}} project planning.|$|E
5|$|Existing {{evidence}} suggests that water fluoridation reduces tooth decay. Consistent evidence also suggests that it causes dental fluorosis, most of which is mild and not usually of <b>aesthetic</b> concern. No clear evidence of other adverse effects exists, though almost all research thereof has been of poor quality.|$|E
5|$|Glyphs are {{inscribed in}} a {{vertical}} orientation, {{even if the}} object depicted (e.g. fish, Orion’s belt) is usually seen horizontally. This serves the purposes of economy and <b>aesthetic</b> effect. The 'vertical rule' is important for interpreting the glyphs correctly, so it may have assisted in secrecy as well.|$|E
5|$|In 2012–2013, Mogadishu's {{municipal}} authority {{in conjunction with}} the British and Norwegian governments began a project to install solar-powered street lights on all of the capital's major roads. With equipment imported from Norway, the initiative cost around $140,000 and lasted several months. The solar panels have helped to improve night-time visibility and enhance the city's overall <b>aesthetic</b> appeal.|$|E
5|$|In game development, he is {{a co-founder}} of Action Button Entertainment, where he {{designed}} games including Ziggurat and Videoball. The four-person studio specializes in simple aesthetics and controls, following from Rogers's own video game <b>aesthetic</b> and minimalist eSports interests. He compared the studio's design philosophy to the spartan menu selections of Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares.|$|E
5|$|Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will (1935)—documenting the 1934 Nuremberg Rally—and Olympia (1938)—covering the 1936 Summer Olympics—pioneered {{techniques}} of camera movement and editing that influenced later films. New {{techniques such as}} telephoto lenses and cameras mounted on tracks were employed. Both films remain controversial, as their <b>aesthetic</b> merit is inseparable from their propagandising of National Socialist ideals.|$|E
5|$|Offshore {{wind power}} {{refers to the}} {{construction}} of wind farms in large bodies of water to generate electric power. These installations can utilize the more frequent and powerful winds that are available in these locations and have less <b>aesthetic</b> impact on the landscape than land based projects. However, the construction and the maintenance costs are considerably higher.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{the first}} {{published}} {{information on the}} cultivation of Dryandra appeared in the magazine Australian Plants in June and September 1961. D.sessilis was among the species treated, but as there was not yet any experimental data on cultivation, information was restricted to its <b>aesthetic</b> qualities and the soil in which it naturally occurs.|$|E
5|$|Some {{groups in}} Japan, {{particularly}} those active in Tokyo, also {{emphasize the importance}} of the lively and spirited iki <b>aesthetic.</b> In taiko, it refers to very specific kinds of movement while performing that evoke the sophistication stemming from the mercantile and artisan classes active during the Edo period (1603–1868).|$|E
5|$|Some of the character's costume {{customization}} options ("skins") {{relate to}} his fictional cultural heritage, {{such as the}} orisha gods of the Yoruba religion and the African ceremonial mask tradition. Doomfist's other <b>aesthetic</b> customization options allude to the boxer Muhammad Ali, the combo sequences of fighting video games, and other pop culture references.|$|E
5|$|The Shaolin {{martial arts}} employ weapons {{in ways that}} are {{sometimes}} enjoyed for <b>aesthetic</b> reasons, however, similar to a dance. Shaolin spear, Yezhan spear, Lanmen spear, and sword and stick exercises may be included. T'ai chi ch'uan also incorporates sword practise in a similar way.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{has received a}} divisive response. While some sources criticized the character's design for clashing with the game's <b>aesthetic,</b> some others praised the visual appeal of the character when in motion. Some have called Necrid {{one of the best}} characters introduced to the series; others deem him one of the worst.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} Barbados {{includes}} distinctive national styles of folk and popular music, including elements of Western classical and religious music. The culture of Barbados is a syncretic mix of African and British elements, and the island's music reflects this mix through song types and styles, instrumentation, dances, and <b>aesthetic</b> principles.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship had}} three smoke stacks {{amidships}} for its boilers, but the forward stack was non-functioning; only added for <b>aesthetic</b> purposes. The ship began service with the Hudson River Day Line as their flagship steamer from 1913 to 1926.|$|E
5|$|Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE is a {{crossover}} role-playing {{video game}} developed by Atlus {{and published by}} Nintendo for the Wii U home console. The game combines gameplay, narrative and <b>aesthetic</b> elements from Atlus' Shin Megami Tensei and Nintendo's Fire Emblem series. It was released in Japan in December 2015 and in North America, Europe and Australia in June 2016.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{influence}} of C. S. Peirce and William James, Putnam also became convinced {{that there is no}} fact–value dichotomy; that is, normative (e.g., ethical and <b>aesthetic)</b> judgments often have a factual basis, while scientific judgments have a normative element.|$|E
