40|$|Earthquake {{recurrence}} {{data from}} the Pallett Creek and Wrightwood paleoseismic sites on the San Andreas fault appear to show temporal variations in repeat interval. We investigate the interaction between strike-slip faults and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>reverse</b> and normal faults as a physical mechanism capable of producing such variations. Under the assumption that fault strength {{is a function of}} fault-normal stress (e. g. Byerlee's Law), failure of an auxiliary fault modifies the strength of the strike-slip fault, thereby modulating the recurrence interval for earthquakes. In our finite element model, auxiliary faults are driven by stress accumulation near restraining and releasing bends of a strike-slip fault. Earthquakes occur when fault strength is exceeded and are incorporated as a stress drop which is dependent on fault-normal stress. The model is driven by a velocity boundary condition over many earthquake cycles. Resulting synthetic strike-slip earthquake recurrence data display temporal variations similar to observed paleoseismic data within time windows surrounding auxiliary fault failures. Our simple model supports the idea that interaction between a strike-slip fault and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>reverse</b> or normal faults can modulate the recurrence interval of events on the strike-slip fault, possibly producing short term variations in earthquake recurrence interval...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comparative study done by FEM {{of the state}} of stresses and strains of a worm face gear with <b>reverse</b> tapered <b>pinion,</b> worm wheel which is made of different materials: ERTACETAL C, BRONZE and CAST IRON. The simulation of real physical phenomena engagement of screw-worm wheel is a sensitive issue that raises many problems. One of the methods allowing achievement of precise geometry of the structure would be considered as complete, is FEM. Considering the geometrical complexity of the analyzed structure, proceed to a simplification of the phenomenon of contact between worm-worm wheels. Thus, for a correct interpretation of the studied phenomenon, corresponding geometric data from a section plane of worm-worm wheel gear is an analysis of the action momentary contact between the worm-worm wheels. The theoretical evaluations are confirmed by the results obtained from the analysis and interpretation of experimental tests of the worm face gear with <b>reverse</b> tapered <b>pinion</b> studied...|$|R

Comparison of acquired data on noise and vibration levels for worm gear reducers equipped with reverse tapered front, is an important indicator regarding the level of quietness in operation of these gears. This has become especially given the particular cone snail related to asymmetric flanks (? 1 = 100, ? 2 = 300).

50|$|The airship's hull had 24-sided {{transverse}} ring frames {{for most}} of its length, changing to an octagonal section at the tail surfaces, and the hull had an internal keel which provided an internal walkway and also contained the accommodation for the crew when off duty. For most of the ship's length the main frames were 32 ft 10 in (10 m) apart, with two secondary frames in each bay. Following the precedent set by LZ 120 Bodensee, crew and passenger accommodation was in a compartment near the front of the airship that was integrated into the hull structure. Each of the five Maybach VL I V12 engines occupied a separate engine car, arranged as four wing cars with the fifth aft on the centerline of the ship. All drove two-bladed pusher propellers and were capable of running in <b>reverse.</b> <b>Auxiliary</b> power was provided by wind-driven dynamos.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} a three-bore buttressed tunnel with ten pairs of {{boarding}} and deboarding accesses. It is 148 meters long in total, but the boarding platform spans only 100 meters. The {{walls of the}} station are covered with brown and gold, anodized, aluminum mouldings. The single lobby under Vinohradská Avenue is 5.6 meters underground. The lobby {{is connected to the}} street by three exits with escalators and to the platform by one long tunnel with escalators running in both directions. Behind the station are two hold yards and one reverse track capable of storing an entire train. Extension of the A-line to the Strašnická Station was achieved by boring tunnels from these <b>auxiliary</b> spaces. The <b>reverse</b> track is still used for reversing and storing trains even though the Želivského Station is no longer the terminus of the line. The construction of the station in 1980 cost approximately 301 million Czech crowns.|$|R
