5|$|As {{part of the}} Oslo Airport {{location}} controversy, {{after the}} new airport was decided located to Gardermoen, there was a public discussion <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with the general aviation which had operated from Fornebu. While some local aircraft owners wanted to keep {{a small part of}} Fornebu for general aviation, the authorities decided to close the airport completely. Instead, the general aviation was distributed to various private airports in Eastern Norway, including Notodden. In May 1998, Air Team started flights from Notodden to Bergen. Air Team gradually moved all its operations, including its pilot school, to Notodden. After Fornebu was closed in October, the airline experienced a quadrupling of patronage, as Gardermoen had given longer travel time for people in Buskerud and Telemark. In addition to business travel, the airline catered offshore workers commuting to the North Sea via Bergen. The airline stated that it intended to also open routes to Stavanger and Copenhagen.|$|E
5|$|The Remembrancer was {{appointed}} for life, and qualified {{to appoint a}} deputy, the first of whom, John West, {{was appointed}} by Sir Christopher Hatton in 1616. From 1565 until 1716, the office was kept in the Fanshawe family, starting with Henry Fanshawe and ending with Simon Fanshawe. After 1820, the Remembrancer's broad duties were split up by the Court of Exchequer (England) etc. Act 1820. To replace him, two masters were appointed, {{one of whom was}} to be the accountant general. These officials were to be appointed by the Chief Baron of the Exchequer from barristers of five years standing, holding offices during good behaviour and unable to appoint a deputy. The masters handled the taking of minutes previously undertaken by the Remembrancer, with the accountant general overseeing all money paid into the court, which was deposited in the Bank of England; previously the Remembrancer had held complete discretion <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with the money.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} requested, for {{an investigation}} into the hemodynamic changes in a patient with chronic venous insufficiency, which results in chronic venous disease, is quite different from an examination request made for suspected deep vein thrombosis. For a DVT investigation {{there is a need for}} guidance <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> look for and to the intended treatment. An investigation performed with the intention of treating the patient by vein stripping or laser therapy for example is very different from the examination performed with the intention of executing a CHIVA. This French originated procedure is also spelt out as conservative hemodynamic treatment for chronic venous insufficiency. A CHIVA is an ultrasound guided, minimally invasive surgery strategic for the treatment of varicose veins, performed under local anaesthetic.|$|E

5|$|The rise of Fascism in {{particular}} frequently encouraged greater state involvement. In Italy, {{between the end}} of the war and 1923 local groups and organisations had established their own local memorials in villages and towns. Not all villages agreed that memorials were appropriate, either for political or religious reasons. With the Fascist revolution, this process became more centralised; veteran groups were assimilated by the Fascist government in 1926, and a systematic attempt to construct suitable national and local memorials followed. In Germany, the political and economic chaos of the immediate post-war years discouraged the construction of civic war memorials and comparatively few civic memorials in their larger towns, mainly due to the shortage of funds in the inter-war German economy and political disagreements between local groups <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> commemorate and how. Those memorials that were constructed were often built instead by local movements, representing particular factional interests. It was only after the rise of the German Nazi party to power in 1933 that substantial funding began to flow into construction programmes, controlled from Berlin.|$|E
25|$|One other {{explanation}} is that about 40,000 of Hidalgo's volunteer troops abandoned the effort after the battle with efforts to recruit more from the local area failing and there was disagreement among the ranks and leadership <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do next.|$|E
25|$|The Marquis Matsugae meets Count Ayakura {{and they}} arrange an {{abortion}} for Satoko in Osaka. On {{the way back}} to Tokyo, Satoko and her mother stop at the Gesshu Temple to see the Abbess. Satoko slips away and hides from her mother, who later discovers that she has cut off her hair and resolved to become a nun. The Abbess, who suspects that a plot against the Emperor is unfolding, hopes to thwart it by shielding Satoko. Baffled <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do, the weak-willed Countess returns to Tokyo for help. But neither the Count nor the Marquis succeed at removing Satoko from the convent.|$|E

25|$|With {{the end of}} the Iraq War and the {{drawdown}} of the War in Afghanistan, {{there was}} some question <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with MRAPs, as they were designed specifically for asymmetric warfare. The Army decided they would keep them in some sort of service post-war. Of the approximately 20,000 MRAPs in service, 30 percent (6,000) will stay in brigade combat teams as troop transports and route clearance vehicles, 10 percent (2,000) will be used for training, and 60 percent (12,000) will go into storage. MRAPs are to be superseded by the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle when it enters service in 2016. It still may be used until 2022, when the JLTV is in use in sufficient numbers.|$|E
25|$|To refill his {{depleted}} forces, Tabinshwehti immediately {{ordered his}} vassals {{to raise more}} men, and send more provisions. But {{there was not enough}} time. The Toungoo command was split <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do next. One faction led by Gen. Nanda Thingyan recommended lifting the siege, reasoning that it was more important to defend the delta. But others including Bayinnaung disliked an outright lifting of the siege because Prome's forces, they feared, could join in on an attack from the north. In the end, they settled on the proposal by Thiri Zeya Kyawhtin: (1) continue the appearance of a siege with a minimal force, (2) meet the enemy on both fronts, (3) if either front fails, lift the siege and defend the homeland, and (4) resume the siege if the Arakanese were defeated.|$|E
25|$|Mel {{then has}} brief flings with Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick), Nathan Williams (Doug Allen), Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) and Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), despite Phil {{living with her}} best friend, Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin), at the time. However, her on/off flirtation with Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) is the only {{relationship}} that lasts and they marry in March 2001, despite Steve finding out that she had slept with Phil on Christmas Day 2000 in a drunken one-night stand. On their wedding day, Phil is shot by a mystery assailant and Steve is the prime suspect. Mel suspects it is him but he protests his innocence. Phil recovers from the shooting and confronts the culprit who {{turns out to be}} Lisa. Steve forgives Mel and on Phil's instruction, he decides to frame his enemy Dan. Dan is wrongly imprisoned for Phil's attempted murder, and after his release, believing that it was Steve who actually shot him, kidnaps Mel in revenge. Dan demands a large sum of money and Steve grows desperate. During her few days of captivity, Dan tells Mel about Steve's dodgy dealings and criminal activities. Phil comes to her rescue and Dan flees. Mel takes time out after burning down her and Steve's club, E20, as revenge for Steve's lies. He woos her round, however, and they plan to emigrate to America with Lisa, her boyfriend Mark Fowler (Todd Carty), and Lisa's daughter, Louise (Rachel Cox). However, Mark can't go having been denied a Visa due to his HIV and Lisa is torn <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do, the plan is falling apart but Steve absconds with Louise but Phil follows them and a car chase ensues; Steve swerves and crashes. Phil rescues Louise and is about to go back for Steve but is too late – the car explodes with Steve inside and he dies.|$|E
2500|$|They {{also stated}} that whilst the Super Slim model is {{not in any way}} an upgrade, it could be an {{indicator}} <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what's</b> <b>to</b> come. [...] "It may not be revolutionary, but the Super Slim PS3 is the same impressive machine in a much smaller package. There doesn't seem to be any reason for existing PS3 owners to upgrade, but for the prospective PS3 buyer, the Super Slim is probably the way to go if you can deal with not having a slot-loading disc drive." ...|$|R

500|$|If a {{defendant}} {{at the time}} of trial claims he is insane, this hinges on whether or not he is able to understand the charge, the difference between [...] "guilty" [...] and [...] "not guilty" [...] and is able to instruct his lawyers. If he is unable to do these things, he can be found [...] "unfit to plead" [...] under Section 4 of the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964. In that situation, the judge has wide discretion <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with the defendant, except in cases of murder, where he must be detained in hospital.|$|E
500|$|The game is {{a fantasy}} city-building {{simulator}} in which the player creates a kingdom from the ground up. Starting with a barren town consisting of a lone castle and a large power crystal, by using the crystal's power the player can magically place a variety of buildings to populate the settlement and draw in residents. The game makes limited use of the Wiimote's motion-sensing abilities and can be played one-handed. Each [...] "day" [...] lasts approximately 10 minutes and players are given an increasing amount of options and <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do that day as the game progresses. At {{the end of each}} day, adventurers return and the player reviews what was accomplished that day.|$|E
2500|$|The colonists {{disappeared}} {{during the}} Anglo-Spanish War, {{three years after}} the last shipment of supplies from England.

500|$|Much of what {{is known}} of the design process for the three-dollar piece is from an August21, 1858, letter from the Mint's chief engraver, James B.Longacre, the coin's designer, to the then-Mint director, James Ross Snowden. [...] This letter is {{apparently}} in response to some criticism, and in it, Longacre discussed his views on coin design, especially regarding the three-dollar piece. He noted that he was initially perplexed <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> put on the coin; the three-dollar piece {{was the first time he}} had been allowed to choose a design. [...] Although he had designed the three-cent piece and other issues before Snowden's directorship, he had been told what to put on those pieces. [...] The coin weighed 64.5 grams, and had a fineness of 900.|$|E
500|$|In January 1910, Walter Camp {{published}} his All-Time All-American list in Century magazine, selecting {{the best player}} at each position over the 20years he had been watching college football. [...] He selected Schulz as his center, {{the first of many}} such All-Time All-American selections for Schulz. At the time, Camp said: [...] "Big, strong and fast, he combined all the defensive and offensive qualities of the best line men with the speed, sure tackling and intuition <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do on the instant that are winning qualities of the defensive back. [...] In addition, his passing was excellent, as he had plenty of speed for his kicker, steadiness for his quarter, and ability to pass in directions other than in a straight line which made him especially valuable in certain formation plays".|$|E
500|$|Label {{personnel}} were undecided <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> consider {{as the lead}} single. Reid was considering whether [...] "Yeah!"

[...] was leaked, [...] "Burn" [...] {{was chosen as the}} official first single from Confessions. [...] "Yeah!", which was intended as a promotional song and a teaser for Usher's fans, was released to street DJs and mixtapes. However, the favorable response to the song led to a change; [...] "Yeah!" [...] was the lead single and [...] "Burn" [...] was set as its follow-up. [...] "Burn" [...] was released in the United States on July 6, 2004 as a CD single and 7" [...] single.|$|E

500|$|With the {{impending}} electrification of the Southern Railway's Central Section (the former LB lines), the question arose <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> {{do with the}} relatively new and powerful LB designs.

[...] These Baltics had proved to be capable machines on the Brighton line, although their relatively low boiler pressure (...) , the excessive difference between [...] "first valve" [...] and [...] "second valve" [...] on the regulator, and more particularly their small (...) piston valves in relation to their large (...) cylinders were a significant limitation, precluding their use on any other part of the Southern system. [...] The decision was taken to rebuild them into more conventional 4-6-0 tender locomotives.|$|E

Sleep refused to have the album released in any edited form which led to a deadlock between London and the band.

500|$|The defence {{comes in}} two forms; where the {{defendant}} {{claims he was}} insane {{at the time of}} the crime, and where the defendant asserts he is insane at the time of trial. In the first situation, the defendant must show that he was either suffering from a disease which damaged the functioning of the mind and led to a defect of reason that prevented him from understanding what he was doing, or that he could not tell that what he was doing was wrong. In the second situation, the test is whether or not the defendant can differentiate between [...] "guilty" [...] and [...] "not guilty" [...] verdicts, instruct counsel and recognise the charges he is facing. If successful, he is likely to be detained under the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964, although judges have a wide discretion <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|E
